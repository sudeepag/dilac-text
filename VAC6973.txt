THE KNIGHT OF THE BLACK FLAG. at   CHAPTER I. ---"He was the mildest mannered man Thatever scuttled ship or cut a throat; With suoh true breeding of a gentleman, You never could divine his real thought."' -BaorW. "Yes, noble lady, I am dreaminwg-dream- In of the day when I shall wear the spurs of knighthood, be kind to my inferiors, courteopu to my equals, and aeknowledee no superior of m; ownsex but my God andthl king!" she spot where these words were spoken are in a wildly beautiful valley in Wales, a rocky, wooded dell, which lay beneath the walls of, an ancient castle, whose lofty grey towers and rough battlements gave token of its power, well garrisoned, to withstand the siege of an army. And it had withstood more than one siege; for its lordly owner, the Earl of Caermarthen, had been true to Charles the Martyr, scorning Cromwell and his bloody protectorate, and now gloried in the favor of the reigning monarch, Charles the Second. The castle stood high amqlg the craggy cliffs which border the western. orst of Wales; so near the sea that the roar of the ocean surges could be heard in its halts, when- over the spirit of the storm awoke them, frow their slumbers. And down from arid those crags, crossing the winding pathway t,' the castle, where a rude bridge spanned it, rushed the main fountain of the Towy river on its foamy way to Cardigan Bay. The speaker was a yung man, not fai .past his twentieth year, in the lower of rength and manly beauty..  fne fieorm waM inly but neatly clsd in a $ashion which int te his vocation to be a military one. A swrd rested in its seabbard on his thigh, and a dag\ - ger was in his belt. A peaked hat with a broad brim shaded his white forehead, over;   which drooped a single ostrich feather, as black  as night. From beneath this ht, his hair de- scended in FIossy brown curls down upon his shoulders, in true "cavalier" style, and the lower part of his finely-featured blonde face was covered with a soft and curling beard, which had never known the desecrating touch of the razor or scissors; the one a most f barber-out, and the other, a most treacherous and Delilah-ian weapon. f That the youtngmai wore nrms, in that time. was sufficient to prove that he either was i gentle blood, or else in the service of one A the nobility. His manner to the lady, whose questioning had elicited, the words which oc- curl at the opening of this story, was humble and deeply respectful; but yet he permitted his blue eyes unabashed to gaze upon her  ,tuiy gorious beauty; and though the color came and wept upon, his face like the blushes of a bashbfu maiden,.there was no tremor in his voiee when he replied to her. She had ridden up to him, followed by two attendants of her own sex, while he stood leaning against an oak by the side of the rushing stream, nao deep a reverie that he had not heard her approach. id she  as very beautiful. Nor did'l err. Her oble bust was well displayed, as she Bat upon an Arsbiano ourser of snowy white; and though a look of cold and haughty pride somewhat marbleiPed her perfect eatures, an illuminating smile so softened them, when she spokp .oW h young man, that to him shelbok- ed like /a angel: . ahy Aspiration are lofty, Master Henry," said she, with asmile athia words, "Very, lady I so lof that few ears will hear me tter tmhe. Excuse ^my folly in speaking of them."  \" ay, I did not say it was folly, Master eiry. said the lady, quickly, for he scemed   to have felt the slight sarcasm of her words. "If thou wert of noble birth, thy advance- ment would be easy, for Nature has been boun- tiful to thee in her gifts. Thou art brave, hast a courtier's polish, and my fathtir says, art the best soldier in his trainm" - . , Thy noble fatheris kind, laiy; bt thot h I may not claim such noble blood al fow in the veins of the queenly heiress of Cuerfmar- then, I come not of an ignoble stock. And little care I for the registry of the past, when with mine own good sword I may carve out:i' record for the futurel" "Well, God speed thee, Master Henry; thou shall everthave tl prayers of iHelens of Cer; marthen, for she does "not foget thatshbe o*es her life to thy bravery. Ever when I gaze upon this rushing stream I shall remember the brave youth who bore me, a drowning child, from its angry waters. God speed thee in all honorable aims, but do not soar beyond thy strength!" A*d bowing a gentle adieu, the lovely young girl-who'did not seem to be yet out of her teens, though pride and station made her womanly beyond her age-rude on toward the ofstle, followed by her attendants. The young man stood like one spell-bound, following her with his eyes so long as she could be seen, even until she had ridden within the castle gates. And then his then his tghts found utterance.  "To win thee, Helen, of Caermarthen-to win thee, I would wade to my lips in human blood!" he exclaimed, passionately: "Thou dost look high, Master Henry Mor- gan," said a harsh voice, close to his side.' Quick as a bolt of lightning dashes from a cloud, the young man's hand flew to his sword-hilt, and he turned fiercely upon the speaker, but whenihe saw that he was a dwarf- ish and deformed old man, whoseheight wowuld not -more than have reached his sword'belt, hos weapon was not dmwn    . But he spoke in a bitter tone. "Whb art thou,*" he asked, "that thus reeps up like a spy to catch my words?" ( I am no epy, bit the friend of Henry Mor- gan, if he will use me-his foe, if he dares to as emel" said the oldman  . . A smile of mingled scorn and pity Qrosed the aee of lMogan, doisarmiig his anger at once.        : "Because I am nbt:of thystatauw tlhOu doet think me weakl"said the dwarf, luuodingly, as he noted that swiile. "Hadet thou drawn thy weapon, thou mightst have found thy match in me!" The young man laughed outright. Nay--doubter, thou shalt ry me"r said t he old man, augrily,and 1he drew from its sheath a rapier almost as long as himselft Put up. thy sword, old man; I am not a   boy, and can bear thy humors I have no cause of anger against thee." "Then why inmult me?" "I have not insulted thee [" "Young man, thou dost speak falsely  'lere ij more of wrong in a smite of scorn, or a o  : ofii contempt, than in all the vaporing words e'r uttred by a braggart or a fool 1P "Old m;an, thine age and weakness alone protect thee! No sound man can call Henry Morgan a falsifier without answering for it with his best blood!" "If I am not 'sound,' feel whether or not my sword is V" Anl as he eaid this, tho old man qtruok the othr a/smart blow upon the shoulder with the fiat of his naked blade., "By the saints, wert thou my father I would not bear that!" cried the young man angrily; and his sword was drawn instantly. The old man was already in position for at- tack or defence, and with a moclting laugh, bade the young man come on. Blinded by rage, the youth commenced the attack, thinking to crush his antagonistin an instant. But his first thrust was parried, as 'f with an arm of steel; his second fared no be.- ter; and in a moment or two more, he foun i that indeed he had got his match. In vaia did he try to break down the guards of his opponent; in vain did he try to force him back. He was 'firm as the rook uporv which he stood, and from standing upon the defensiv r, in a few moments became active in the nattack. Henry was forced to step back, for his op- ponent's point found way within his guard. As he' did so, his foot slipped, and at the same moment the old man's rapier, by a light twist, wrenched his weapon from his hand, and the young man lay disarmed and helplems upon the ground. "Man or devil, whatever thou art, strike, and finish thy work!" cried the young man, more mortified and paned than he would have been with his death-wound. "No-no-Master Henry I am no longer ahd. Rise, and put thy sword in its scab- for I like thee, and will be thy friend, whether thou wilt or not. Though I am not clad in velvet or gold, it is not because I yhaue them not-the prud Earl of Osermarthen cannot'Eoininiin more wealth than I!" "Who, in the Lord'y name, art thou?" cak- ed Morgan, as he rose to hid feet, and picked up his sword, which he returnted to iUa scab- bard.         - "Thyfries-namseleso forthe present; but yetthy fini..Henry Morgan!" "Tho dost seem to know me well?" "Ai , that I do.

"It is strange that thou canst master mel 'a There is not my superior in yonder castle. The earl himself cannot do what thou hast a done!9" "The earl has not been through the school i where I learned to use my weapon--a school t] where blows were harder, and more plenty  V than words"!" ' "Strange mystery that thou art! How is IC it that, thou knowing me so well, I should not n have seen thee before?" "My form is not so lofty as yonder tower; t nor so shapely thatit should attract attention; t nor -do I often show- myself amid the; crowd which follows at the heels of rank. Besides, young man, of late thou hast'had no use of thine eyes, xexept to follow the 'stately form m of tfe 'Lady Helen. Nay, thou must not get aigry with me again; for if thou dost, I wil  not fight thee! We must be friends.' I do not tame thee that thou dost love the noble, ' 1-Asy; nor should thou' blame me that I have r re'd thy secret. :'Thy ambition is honorable, t and it is in my po*er to forward thee therein,' I '"Thou art strangely kind to one who is not of kin to thee, nor has rendered unto thee any; "' All true meni reakin; and he who only serves another because of a Service rendered, is 'hut  mierchanit bf his favors. Thou wouldat know. more of me?" "Indeed I would. I would fain unveil the mystery which wraps thy character, like a form shrouded in darkness, from me." "' Thy wish shall be gratified'; for it meets my own dlesire. Thou, well kpowest where yondoe streaP m first leips from its birth-lake- a crystal 'basin l9pped in the crest of the mountain?" "I do, right Well. It leaps full hal a bow, shot over a precipiee, in a sheet as bright as iolten silver. I have looked pon it often." ' Ay; and' ai often have I looked on thee, young ,uman; for that silveyi' sheet contains the gte of my castle!"', i, Thy castle?, Art thoui oonking me?" "Come to the foot of the waterfall at the hpur :of midnight, and I will show thee that there is no mocking in my words. Revesa tis meeting too n6 one; but some alon- thou wilt hot rtgret it ' ... ( I will conme' said the young man. "It is well-fail not," replied the other. /   And then, bowing his farewell, he turned into a narrow pathway, whichiled toward the moun- tain he had alluded to, and disappeared. CHAPTER II. For a short time, young Morgan remained silent after the old man left him, and, with' his hands hard pessed upon his brow, seemed to be studying into the mystery of that 'sin- gular interview. Atlast he spoke histhoughts aloud; "He must be human!" he said, evidently' alluding to the dwarfish old man. "His fee- tures were noble, even though his shape wa ' crooked. Yet he seemed to divine my every thought-knew at once a secret which I have hidden in my own heart, and dared scarcely to acknowledge to myself--my mad, idolatrous love for the liady Helen. Human or not, I will meet him at the appointed hour and place." The clattering of steel-shod hoofs fell upon the young man's ear at this moment, andritin' terrupted his soliloquy.; anid a frown gath. ering on his face, betokened his dislike to a gayly-dressed and plunied cavalier, who gal- loped by him so closely in the narrow eau-  way, that he could have touched him with' his gloved ihand,' had he been so minded; yet; in his haughty pride, he did not seem .to notice  "that any one stood there. .The cavalier was' closely followed by two armed servitors, who, riding abreast and carelessly, took up the en- tirety of'the road ;' and one, 'f them would have riddeni ovIr young Morgan, had he not dexteriously s-izedhis bridle-rein, and, with a powerfql .exertion, cast the horse back upon his hauncheS.- WThei was'done so suddenly, that the untpr e pared ridbr coold not keep his seat, but, fhot backward from his saddle like an arrow'from the bow, aniid fell heavily, at full length up*a the 'groun&d His wild cry, and that of the other inder,' reached the ears of the cavalier, whoia&ad ridden pASt. and he checked his horse in tim* to see the fall of his servant.' Riding angrily, - back, he cried out; 'S What does this mean, varlet?" "I am no varlet of thine, Lord Percivsl!" , said youiig orgat,' angrily.

CHAPTER III. ' Moonlight adds to every scene which is al- ready grand and beautifal, silverig with its light the bold-drawn lines of grace, or deep. wing in shade the slrihnking fiults-adds to ev ry scene of grandeur or loveliness, wheth- er it oe a field of icebergs tossing in a north. ern sea, a flower-bordered river in a land of sunshine, a  city' of palaces,' or a craggy mountain that even overtops the clouds. Ift was midnight, and Henry Morgan stood at the foot of $ sheet of water, which he had trnly described as falling like molten silver from the loftqy cliff above. The moon, in her "full" robe ingolden glor in the cloudless sky, and lighting the projecting and open spaces of the rocky heigl^ts, and the water and flowery glen below, seemed to make dark- er and more dense those shadowy nooks which ito rays did not penetrate. I The scene was very beautiful, and though the ainad off yonuig Morgan was intent upon the rrand which brought hinrthere, his soul, nstyetdeadened by world-contact, could not but thrill in admiration of the picture hung before him by Nature's artist-hand. He pawused near the waterfl to look around him. Ato(h upon his hand aroused him from a delicious reverie, and, turning, he saw the sygular person who had appointed the inter- . view. "I have kept my promise-I am here," t said theyoung man.           i "Thou hast acted wisely. Follow me!" replied the other. And to the astonishment of the young man, who had never known of a Paage beneath the very curtain 6f tie fall, the a n man en- tered such a passage, and disappeed in the h spray and gloom.  The yout-h was too brave to hesitte, and, A hamf-blmaded with the mist he presad hatily m.

VI usv the odman stood waiung foi h'm, and,.   o a few steps in advance stood an athletio negro, Pt with a flaming torch of sweet-smelling, resin. u ous wood in his hand: The negro was jetty d black, dressed in a costume somewhat Turk- '- ish; but all his habiliments were of snow- o white, making his own color look all the n darker by contrast. 1I As Morgan joined him, the old man waved his hand for the negro to precede them; -and  f they passed l1onk the arched way a consider- - able distance, until they apparently came-to e the end of it; for no further avenue could be - seen' A solid wall of smooth rock appeared before them; The torch-bearer gave a shrill, peculiar whistle, and a portion of the rook seemed to open on a pivot, as if by magic, re- vealing a door through which a horseman - might have ridden. A At a sign from the old man, Morgan pro. * ceded hin), entering a vast circular hall, which seemed to serve at once as a store-room, mag- azine, and arsenal, for there were boxes, casks, muslts, pikes, sabres, and even cannon here. These the young man saw at a glance, and also that two armed sentinels of the same co- lor as the torch-bearer, and of like stature, paced to and fro. And so well were they dtis ciplined, that they paid not the iligitest re. gard to the intrusion of the stranger, evidently acting under orders. This room was lighte by one large silver lamp, such as were used in churches in those days; in tjuth, tiw la]mp, from the sacred images upon it, seemed to have been made for a church. The guide did not pause here a moment, but passe4 on; and the next moment Henrfouud himeslf in a small but elegantly furnished apartment, agreeable in temperature, and filled with every luxury. Here 'the cld man pointed to a seat, and said: "Rest, Master Henry, I make thee welcome to my poor castle!"   *1  Then, turning to the tor-bearer, he said: guTell Mirer thring rerehmente for my The negro bowed his head, and retired. through one of several a"nues which ap- peared to lead from this room. In a few minutes, during which time the old mnan had 'been enjoying the ilent wonder of the other, an' ill-formed and Ugly-looking neo gress came n, earJng we, and cake anmd fruit on a silver saver. These, at a sign from her master, she placed upon a small taile which she moved to a position between him and his ueflst and then she retired.

"Thou hadt bet ttergrir k that of thy slady- love 1" said the old in, quietly, purposely appearing to misunderstand the: meaning of the other. "I would rather drink to my host, but know not his name or title i" said Henry, com- ing to the point. "My title " said' the old man, and a bitter sneer rather distorted his otherwise tine fea- tures. "I once was--no .matter, though-;-no matter--'twill not do tell thee now, Thou mayst call me Ethelbert the Hermit-"for'the' present, I do not*choose to be known: by any other name!"

The young manr ro mand followed the other' into a smaller apartment, the walls of which' Were overhmirg 'with maps and charts, inter- apersed'with Manyrih andcurioius specimens- of arms, such as swords, dagger, pistols, and muskets. Around the sides of the roomwere. arranged 'nany massive, oaken dAbts-; and as the old man opened the M ofthese, Mporgan's eyes were fairly dlar"ed 'rvith the immense wealth; displayved itplate, oe n, and jewelry. He no longer ;ondeed tShat-the ld man should boast of power equal to Caermarthen'e wealthy earl, forhere Was the purchase of half a gkilg. dom, or so seemed to him. , But thoughs almost speechless from sur- prise, his ruling passion soon displayed itself. for his eyes tuined from the wealth below, to the arms whibh hung above. The old man wsmiled as he saw this: . - "Here is a sword, Master Henry," said he, taking down ra mpngajcent, straight-bladed 'Toledo, the seabbardof which was steel, inlaid with gold, the hilt solid gold, with a star-like jewel glitterng in. its pommel--" here is a. sword once owned by a $Spanish duke.: When he lost it,' healso lost a ship laden with gold, and silver, which he had pillaged from the Ino casd'fPetru.

"Ay-it pays, it pays; and they are about a eowardlyin battle with s, 3Bitons, as they are cruel, if they ever get ny of us in their power!"   .  . Morgan still gased intently on the map, noting the nImea of. towns anislands, whose famed riohe;had alrady :eaoeed his ear. Suddenly,a females voiee, from some apart* ment near, was heard, rirh and full of melo- dy, ehanting these words: Where the southern breezes blow; Kissing waves forever blue- Whareinadying flowers grow Of every lovely hue.- Wier golde n is te ocean strand, where snowy pearls abound, In that far-off sunny land,  Thy fortune shall be found!

Great iron ringe sta- pled into the rocks, looked as if they had been used for the purpose of mooring vessels. A small, sharp built sail-boat, or shallop, was hauled into a narrow dock by the side of some stone steps, which descended to the water; and it looked as if it was often used. As this was a part of the coast where the waves never were at rest, and which all vessels avoided, beoause of its dangeroueness and utter destitu. tion of harbors, the surprise of the young man was redoubled. "Now, it does not seem so wonderful to thee that I furnished my castle unknown to those who dwell int the earldom of Caermar- then l" said tl. old man, while his young companion reiained silent from sheer aston- iahment. "It seems yet more wonderful that man should have been so daring as to pass yonder terrible range of breakers, and to thread the narrow and tortuous passage whiqh leads to this harbor. The error of a fathom in the helmsman's eye or judgment would dash a bark o atoms in the mad surges, and no life could be saved," replied Morgan. "True, young man; but experience and long, aquaintanoe with danger makes men skilll.; Buut ,havp- learned thee. enough of my seorete to show 'thee that 1 deem thee trustworthy.: -lBeware, that thou dost not betraym-o"'i -, - , "I would sooner lose my right arm!" re plAd bo ybuag ma, blusing,.that he should be thought even deserving of a caution.

No -not if a thousand earls commanded, or as many lords demanded an apology. My lips never shall open to so base a purpose." "Thou'lrt right, my brave boy  I have not mistaken thee. If the earl insists upon this apology, leave his service, and I will send thee to those who will appreciate thy valor, and place thee on a road to preferment. True thou wilt miss the presence of her upon whom thou hast east the eye of love ; but thou wilt, in absence, either conquer that love, or else render thyself more worthy of it." "Thy advice shall be followed," said the young man, after a brief pause. "And I think it were best for me to return to the cas- tle, or the sun will rise ere I get there." "It were as well. Whatever may happen, be fearless, and knowth;t thou hast in me a friend who is not nowerless." "A thousand thaks, most noble Ethel- bert!"  "Tush! I need no thanks.  In serving thee, I serve myself. Come back and take another glass of wine, and then I will escort thee back to the spot where we met, and in- instruct theo how, at any tihe, to gain admit. tance to me. And, rememler, if we meet at the castle at nny time, we nMeet as strangers, no matter in what garb I amI or what position I assume."       J "Thy wishes shall be as/law to me, frnd Ethelbert," said the young man. By this time they had, on their return, reached the small apartment, where refresh- ments had been taken, and again the two pledged each other in a glass of wine. CHAPTER IV. Scarcely had the forms of the old man and his young guest disappeared from the room, when Morgan started to return to the castle, when a young female entered, whose exqui- site beauty was almost superhuman. Well, indeed, was it for his truth to the Lady Hel- en, that he had not seen this fairy-like crea- ture, for he were either more or less than man who could hare gazed uncharmed upon her.  Her figure was tall, exquisitely propor-.  tioned-her features elasiclly perfect; her  complexion a transparent brunette, so rich that it seemed almost aglow with light; her [ eyes large and black as night, full-h! all 1 too full- of- passion and life. A mas  of silken curls, as dark and bright as her eyes,:  fell from her well-shaped head down upon  her white shoulders, as carelessly as if no comb or band had e'er restrained it.  Her face expressed pleasure as she came in,  and she seated hersel on a cushioned otto. t man; and, taking up the guitar, played a wild, rapid, exultant march, s if her heart i   was bounding to the footsteps of new-born Joy. )  The tread of the old man, when he re- turned, did not arouse her from the reverie into which she had fallen, while her fingers almost unconsciously trilled the chords ofthe I instrument which she held; but the touch of , his hand upon her shoulder, and the sound of ; his voice, aroused her, and a glad, rosy smile overspread her face, as he spoke. "Well, my Caroline, hast fed thy curiosity sufficiently?" asked the old man, while his voice denoted a slight touch of sarcasm, "What dost thou mean, dear father?" she asked, in a voice as dulcet as the song of birds.    i "What didst thou think of my stranger- guest? Nay, put on no air of innocence, nor pretend that from behind yonder curtain thou J wert not a witness to our interview. If thou shouldst again essay such an espial, smother the sighs so that they do not reach my ears." "So thou didst hear me sigh, dear father?" Ay, child, and wondered what thou hadat seen to sigh for." "I sighed, because I was not a man, my father-young, and brave, and strong-with a sword by my side, and great deeds before me  But this cavalier, to whom thou hast taken so strange afancy, is he nobly born-. one of those knights of whom thou used to tell me in iy childish days, when I asied thee to tell me stories of the world which 1 had not seen?" "Nobly born, child? Was he not comely in form and features?" "Truly so, my father." "With. an eye of firi and a voice as cleat as a bugle?" Even so, dear father." "With a look of truth and courage?" "Ay, my father. But what is his title  Thou didst only call him ' Master Henry!"' "His title, child came fromr God. It is that of man! All earth-borb. titles are worthless if that does not prefix them!" "Then he is not a lord?" "No; he is only the son of a poor country squire; yet many a lord nobly born lacks that which he hath-honor, truth, and a noble presence!" The young girl seemed to have ased thought enter her mind; for a shadow came upon her brow, and her bosom heaved with a sigh. "Wherefore that sigh, Coraline?" asked 'her father. "I was thinking, my father, that-judging by the stories that thou hast told me in past times--his must be a rough path to travel in this world, who, unfavored by birth or for- tune, seeks to advance in it!" "True ; but courage courts apposition, and surmounts obstacles which, to the eowardly,   *re impossible. - Henry Morgan is of no com- moa mold; he will advance. Had I not fore- seen that, and known his worth, he had never become a guest of mine. I like him, and will help him!" ",I am glad, my father; for I, too, like him!" "Thou, Coraline-thou, who hast never ex- changed a word with him?" "I have both seen and heard him speak, my father!" "( But thou must remember that he loves the heiress of Caermarthen 1"  He may think he does; but he has not seen me yet!"And the girl smiled, as she glanced at a mirror which reflected her peer- leas charms to her own eye. "I must take care that he does not, if thou shouldst begin to talk of love, ere thou hast more than peeped at him through a half- closed curtain! "I did not speak of ove, dear father. I merely echoed thy words, and said that I liked him. If 'twill please thee, I will try to hate him!" "I'll hot bid thee do that, my child. Like thy angel pmother, who rests now itn. heaven, thou must always be ex'me in everything. But go to rest, sweet child-go to rest. The night has nearly gone by, and a few hours of rest will be irelcome toboth thee and me." "Thy- bless"ih, dear father!" And the lovely girl knelt to receive that dearest of all gifts-her parent's benediction. i' Heaven blesr thee, my sweet child-Heav- en bless thee!" murmured the old man, laying his thin, white hand upon herfiead. She rose, pressed her red lips upon his high, pale brow, and, then glided from the room. His eye followed her until she disap- peared; and then he, murmured : "My lost Iode yet lives in Coraline." MAPfTER V. The sun had but just brightenel the gray turrets of Caermarthen's castle, when the notes of the clarion, ringing shrill and clear, echoed by the baying hounis and the neigh- !Pg of well-fed coursers, gave token that the noble earl intended, as he frequently did, to enjoy a hunt, anl start a stag in the forest. ' And not King Charles himself- had a better stud or kennel, or went to his sport with more show or a greater retinue, than did Edric, the Earl of Caermarthen.  There were belted knights in his train, and near a hundred' sqdlres; and of these last, the favorite was Henry Morgan -since his strong arm had saved the life of the Lady Helen when it was periled, yes, almost lost in the angry flood. But this morning, though the Lady Helen, superbly robed; an mounted upon her snow- white Arabian, Wa upon his right hand, and "   the gay young   iord Percival sat upon his horse on the left, *e face of the earl wore an angry look, as lie bade Henry Morgan ride uD. The young esquire, who looked as noble sa any man present, and who sat on his fi erv steed as well, rode forward with uncovere'i 'head; but his face was flushed with strong feeling, for the sneering look of young Lord Percival was upon him, and he felt it. *"Art thou ready to- tender to this noble lord the apology which I forewarned thee, last night, thou shouldst make?" asked the earl, as Morgan reined in his horse before him.  "When I have erred, then will I acknowl- edge it, Earl Cedric I I have done no wrong to the Lord Percival!" repli( d Morgan, boldly. "How?" cried the earl, growing darker still with rage. "Didst thou not overthrow his man-at-arms, and, when he rebuked thee, reply to him with insolence?" "I prevented his menial from riding over me, and when he called me a varlet, told him that I was in thy service, not in his! inad I been his 'equal in birth, my sword should hJae replied to his insult!" "Ha! Darest thou threaten him in my resence?" "I threaten not, Earl Cedric." !"Thbu liest, varlet 1" lThe face of the young man grew purple with passion at this taunt. But, with a pow- erful effort, he choked down the words wh'ch trembled on his lips-the words of bitter an- ger-and said: "If Earl Cedric has nq longer need of my servicees I will go where' uncalled-for insult will not be heaped upon me when I am power- less to resent it 1" "Father, deal notso harshy with the young man!" urged the Lady Helen, gently. "Re- member the past service he'bath rendered!" "Benefits past are washed out in his pres ent insolence" -said the earl, angrily. " lie either apologizes to Lord Percival this instant, or leaves my service forever!" "I thank thee, noble earl, for the choice 1" said the young man, proudly, as he dismount- ed from his horae, which he set bridle free. "And TIthan) thee, gentle lady, for thy inter- cession t" h/added, bowing low to the lovely Lady Helen, whose eyes were bedewed with tears. "As fbr thee, Lord Percival, we shall meet where the ground between us is more equal!" '   , And'while Earl Cedric was speechless be- ' tween anger sad astonishment, the youth strode haughtily away, and in a momlent had passed beyond the gates,of the castle. I Ride on and rouse the stag!"' cried the earl to his master huntsman.   '.Let us heir your music! The fresh air will restore the temper which that ingrate has ruffled!" And he so angrily drove the spurs into his   own horse, that the mettled animal reared, and plunged, and ,became almost unmRtiagea- ble. But as the cavalcade moved on, the trained animal became more quiet; but the, brow of the earl was vet gloomy. The youwg Lord IPercival endeavored to ender himself as agreeable to the Lady Helen as he could; but he strove in vain to win a smile from her troubled face. She had never shown him much favor; and this day she seemed more than ever cold and haughty. In a short time the horns and-loud halloas of the huntsmen announced that the game was afoot; and then the spurs of the noble riders came in play, and soon the whole bril- liant cavalcade was speeding on through the leafy forest, in chase of the startled stag. For a time- the young lord kept company with the Lady Helen; but she was far bett r mounted than he, and soon proved her desire to be alone, by not only distancing him, but by leaving her other attendants' behind. This done, she gradually drew away from the direction of the bunt, leaving the vale and approaching the mountains,- until she could no longer hear the sounds of the hounds or hunters; and then she chclcked the speed of her foaming horse. When she did so, she was in the close vi- cinity off-the waterfall which we described in the third chapter, and was surprised, as she drew her horse up beside the rushing stream, to see young Morgan standing by a rock, looking allnost as harsh and sullen as the stone against which he leaned. Even h r sweet smile did not chase away the gloom from his' face, nor the unusually kind tones of her voice, as she -said: "Thou dost not surely mean to leave my father's service, Master Hent q?" "I have left it, lady!" he replied. "Before I would humble myself to that coward lord- who could insult where resentlment could not reach him - I would tear out my quivering heart, and casn it to the dogs." The lady sighed, and then, as if she feared he would misconceive the reason of her meet- ing him there, said: "I did not expect to have this chance to reason with thee, .Mnater Henry. When I drew aside froin the course of the hunt, it was to disconnect .myself with those whose com- pany was not agreeable to me!" 4"I am thankful for the accident, lady, which gives me the privilege of uttering a grateful farewell to thine ears only!" said Morgan, bowing with the grace of a courtier, and blushing deeply. "I am about to venture forth into an unknown sea, to step into the world where, fame can be had by those who deserve it!" "And where, without friends or wealth thou wilt be powerless!" said the lady.   "I am not friendless, ladyu rleplied lo10. gan, with an air of 'confidence. "No, Master Henry ; for where'er thu Art I will ever be thy friend!" "Bright lady, those words are mor. than triple armor to me!" said the youth. And, kneeling before her, lie seized her hand, and kissed it passionately. i With a haughty flush, she drew back her hand, and said:     I 4 iMy words meant friendship, Master Hen- ry--nothing more!" "t I accept the rebuke, noble!" said Morgan, turning pale with mortification. "Thyfriend- ship is more than one of my birth should dare aspire to I Farewell; and may Heaven-uard thee!"              ' "I did not mean to rebuke thee 1" said the lady. And in an instant blinding tears came "to her eyes. But she wiped them away, with a hand of pride, in a moment, and looked to see if he had noticed them. But he no longer stood before her. Noiselessly he had departed from her presence ; and it was only when she had called his name aloud and received no re- ply, that she felt that she was alone. Then the tears -fell, unrestrained, from her beautiful eyes, and she murmured: *"Why should my birth make a gulf between me and him which never may be passed? Ah I were he but my equal, then would I give rein to my heart, nor strive to check its wayward course!" CHAPTER VI. L"Thou hast acted wisely and well!" said the old man, when Henry Morgan sought him in his subterranean castle, and told him of the events which had caused him to renounce the service of Edric, Earl of Caermarthen. "' Thine is a spirit which should not be fettered down to service: it must have scope. I will fit thee out for an encounter with the world. If thou doest well, thou wilt return to me; if not, it will be thine own fault, and I shall not expect to see thee 1" ," I thank thee, most noble Ethelbert, and as- sure thee that I will never disgrace thy kind- ness, nor prove undeserving, in my deeds here- after, of thy farvor. All that I ask is, a field of aetion wherein I may prove myself worthy of that favor." "Thou shalt have it--thou shalt have it!" I said the old man, warmly. "I will give thee letters to those who are in power near the court of England's king; letters which will command for thee as much attention as if thou wertof noble birth. :But, mark thee ; in , no case let it be known from thy lips whence those, letters came, or where I dwell; and if by any accident thou shouldst ever learn my name or rank, let thy heart keep its secret, as   thou wouldst preserve thine own honor or my favor!" "I! were indeed an ingrate, if I disobeyed thy slightest wish," said Morgan. How didst thou part with the Lady Hel en?" asked the old man ; for Morgan had not told him of the occurrence at the foot of the waterfall. "I left her in anger, that I presumed upon her friendship," replied Morgan, bitterly. And he told him when and where. "Ay I Well, she comes of haughty stock, but thou mayest yet win a position equal at least to her own." "I care not. Were I an emperor, I would not ask her to become my bride! I feel ashamed to think that I have been so weak as to feel a boy's passion for her. Hereforth my soul is dead to love-alive only to ambi- tion." The old man smiled, and said: "Love is but a child, Master Henry; yet It masters all the world. It conquers tyrants, tames savages, unarms warriors, even nerves Cowards to desperate deeds I Love cannot be defied; he is all-powerful-omnipotent," "If so, henceforth I will avoid his power! Having felt his dart, I can shield myself against it in the hereafter." "Perhaps-perhaps!" said the old man, * ith a smile. "But sit thee down, Master Henry, while I go to make preparations for thee to make a fitting advent in the world. Thou wilt commence thy journey toward Lon don in a few hours." "As soon as it pleases thee, most noble Ethelbert!" said the youth. And he threw himself down upon a seat, as the old man left the room. He was weary, for his eye-lids had not been closed during the previous night; therefore it was not wonderful that in a few moments he was lost in the forgetfulness of slumber. His slumber was not dreamless. A vision came to him which thrilled his inmost soul with rapture. He dreamed that a maiden of more than mortal lovelines was standing before him, gazing upon him with a look of unutterable tenderness. He would have spoken ; but she laced a finger on his lips, and in a tone as low and sweet as an angel's whisper, said: "Thou hastdefied the power of Love, proud youth. Trust not thy strength, but wear this Imulet to aid thee!" And she placed a curious ring upon his fin- ger-a ruby heart, pierced with a golden dag- ger, being the emblem n "  I had not seen thee, loveliest of thy sex, when I made the ras boast!" he cried, with such vehemence that he woke. Though he was alone, and knew that heh&d been sleeping, and of course had dreamed, to   y his utter astonishment, he found such a ring upon his finger as that of which he haddrearm- i ed. How it came there, was a mystery to him; and he again felt as if he was in a circle * of enchantment. t  But he was not left long to wonder, for the" e entrance of the old man recalled him from his dreams. I  Bidding him follow him into another apart-  ent, the old man presented him with a suit of apparel as rich as thit worn by any noble in his travels, and said: "Thou wilt find a servant with' two horses awaiting thee, where thou last parted from Ithe lady Helen. There is plenty of gold in thy portmanteau, and the servant has charge of more apparel for thee. I give thee letters of introduction, which thou wilt deliver as direct- ed when thou hast reached London. The Jew Solomon, to whom I commend thee, will fur- nish thee with money whenever thou needest it. Go, and prosper! I shall not be ignorant of what befalls thee. The servant whom I send with thee will be faithful: trust him fully, but do not part with him."- The young man changed his garb for the apparel furnished by his benefactor, at the wish of the latter, and was profuse in his thanks for his kindness. He wished much to tell him of the strange dream which he had had, and more than once glanced at the ring upon his finger; but he still seemed to feel the pressure of the fairy finger on his lips, and he kept silent upon that point. Securing the e tters upon his person, he bade his mysterious friend farewell and departed. As the old man had told him, he found two excellent horses waiting near the waterfall; held by a negro whose dress was like that worn by serving-men, and not so much calculated to attract attention as the garb of those whom he had seen within the cavern-castle of Ethel- bert, though black men were then so seldom seen in England, that the color of the man would he sire to attract observation. As be approached, the negro held his stir- rup ready for him to mount, and he at once vaulted into the saddle. "What is thy nane?" he asked, as he turned and saw the man leap upon the other horse. "Malak, my master," said the negro, bow. ing low. "Dost thou know whom thou art to serve?" "I do, my master!" replied the man.  The youth asked no more questions; but giving his mettlje. horse the rein and sRpu', rode swiftly on, wishing to leave the earldom of Caermarthen as quickly as he could. CHAPTER VI. "In London at last!"  Inured Henry   Morgan, as he arose from his bed in the dark and narrow bed-room of the inn at which he had arrived at a late hour the night before, and which bore the high-sounding title of the "King's Arms." Scarcely had he risen, when Malak, who had slept across the threshold of his door invaria- bly since their departure from Wales, appear- ed to aid him in dressing-a matter in which the young man now took much more care than he had done formerly, for he had already learned that "the world,' judging by appear- ances, most respects him who looks most re- spectable. Owing to the kind forethought of his friend Ethelbert, his wardrobe was excellent, his purse well-filled, and he was enabled to ap- pear as well as the best of those with whom he met, and consequently he received every courtesy at their hands. "Art thou acquainted with the ways of the city?" asked the young man of his servant, after he had breakfasted. "I have been here once with my former master!" replied Malak. "Dost thou know where the Jew Solomon dwells?" "I do, my, master." "( And canst thou show me where one Lord Tarncliff resides?" "I can, my master."  "Then I shall need no guide but thee, good Malak!  I will go first to deliver my letter to the Jew, and after that I will visit the lord whom I named." "Malak awaits his master's orders," replied the black.        .    - " The young man first looked to his letters, and seeing that he still had them, at once sal- lied out, and soon, under the guidance of his servant, stood before a miserable-looking. dwelling, in a narrow and mostungainly street. h "Surely, no man of wealth can live here,"  he muttered.  "It is the Jews' quarters, and they are men-  of wealth," said iMalakl. 4 The Jew Solomon, whom my formn   master has dealings with, dwells here." "A Jew may live in such a den, but a Chris- tian would not," said Morgan, contemptuou ly.  Knock, good Malak, and ask if the Hebrew  is at home, if thou art not indeed mistaken In  the spot."  . The negro struck the oaken door heaavtl with the hilt of a broad-bladej dagger whic[ I he wore in his belt. I After some delay, a small wicket pon one  side of the door was opened, and a pair of  keen black eyes could be seen to glitter from  within. "What seek ye" asked a sharp, querulous  voice. "The Jew Solomon. Does he not dwell,   : here?" replied Morean, impatient that the door was not opened instead of the wicket. "Yes. 'Who wants to see him?" replied the person from within. "1 do," replied Morgan, still more imnpa tiently. "What is thy bsiness with him?" "That he will knuw when I see him." He will know it, ir Stranger, before his door is opened to thee. These are not over- peaceful times, and the Jew have few friends, save those of their own eet" "Out upon thee for an mannerly churl "P cried th young man, angly "Had I not promised Ethelbert, the Hermit, to deliver a letter to the Jew Solomons, I Should not wait to cool my heels before his keinel." "' Why didst thou not say befe that thou wert a messenger from him p" r tplied the per- son from within. "Tarrybut amoment, and I will admit thee."     \ There was a sound as of loosening ehaid and removing bars, and then the door was opened; and an old man, whose hair and long beard were white as snow, but whose yet black eyes glittered like the orts of a serpent, stood upon the threshold. Hi' tall, slender form was dressed in a habit of coarse brown cloth, which descended nearly to lis feet; and his appearance, as well as that of the apartment before the young mnran, indi- cated extreme poverty-a poverty which did not appear to require- to be guarded so se- curely as it was by bolts and bars. "Be seated, sir, and let me peruse the letter which thou bearest. I am the Jew Solomon!" said the old man, pointing to a wooden beah, while he secured the door, after Morgan 6iid his servant had entered. The young man took the letter from within his surcoat, and hainded it to thelJew, but re- mained standing; for, in truth, be neither liked the man, nor his reception, nor the ap- pearance of the dwelling, which was squalid and filthy in an extreme. The Hebrew fastily broke the seal, and a look of pleasure and surprise exhibited itself on his wan face, as he perused the letter. "Pardon me, young master!" he said, turning to Morgan, with a look of humility and respect. "Pardon me, that I did not know who thou wert. My esteemed eoi-r spondent bide me treat thee as if thou wk his own son. I pray thee to follow me. to a more pleasant apartment." And rising, he .unbolted another strong door, whieh opened inward, and revealed a far better furnished apartment. But without pausing, he passed through this room into another, which was furnished in a style ofman- nifieent splendor and oriental luxury, whiA fairly dazzled the eyes of the young man. " pray thee to be seated, and excuse my   presence for a moment; I will be absent only an instant," said the Jew, pointing'to an otto man of crimson velvet. Silent from surprise, Morgan took the seat, whhe theaJew went into another room. He was absent only a few moments, when he re- turned, garbed in a muoh richer style than be- fore, and accorqmpeanied by A young female of that rare and striking beauty so peouliar to women of the Jtewioh rage.       ; (' Thin is my. bghtler-Miriam, Master Mor- gan!" said the Hebrew. She will oommand refreshments for thee; and, perchance, while ,away an hour or two with a song for thee, or some music from the harp,   I must absent myself for a brief time, to fulfill a command sent by my good friend, Ethelbert. Thy servant knows the way to the kitchen, and will, doubtless, take care of himself until my return." Young Morgan bowed low to the Jewish maiden; and ere he glanced a second time at her lovely face, he looked at the mysterious ring upon his finger, as if it were, indeed, an amulet to protect him from the magic power of beraty. She returned his salutation with graceful courtesy, and a few'low-urmmured words of welcome ; and while her father prepared him- self for his walk, went out and prooured a silver tray of refreshments, which she placed before the young man. In a few moments, when they were left alone, she seated herself at a hairp, and with- out waiting ^-r his request, ran her jeweled fingers skillfully over its strings; and, after a brief prelude, sung, in a voice of exquisite harmony and sweetness, these words: JUDAH'S STAR. i. Judah's star, alas! hath set, Hath gone beneath a cloud- Her brightest hopes perished are, And wrapped in imls'ry's bhroud. ! Her sons are wanderers now, Her daughters know no home-- Judah's star alam is set, Her glory lost in gloom.    ,; n. Judah's day, &la *! hath gone, And night is on her now- The glory of her diadem No longer lights her brow. Her sons have los$ their power, Her daughters weep in vain-  Thilory *he hath cast away, o tears will bring again. Jidahl star, alas! hath set In darkness and In gloom; * Her pride is swallowed up In stern Oblltvno't tomb- - Her sons are waidefers now Her daughters weep in ;ai- The lamp which once o'er Judah shone No grief can light again. The voice of the lovely Jewes was so full   of sad pathos, that it is not strange that Mot gan felt her words deeply ; and, in place ot praiselof her exquisite music only, breathed a deep, heart-born sigh. He knew not, in truth, what words to utter which could give comfort to one of that race whih, once so powerful, now knew little besideiepersecution and suffering. The lady, after singing, seemed for a few moments to be loat in a sad reverie; and then, hearing another sigh from the guest of her father, she seemed to feel herself to blame, and sought, with another song of a different nature, to chase away the gloom which she had apparently caused. After a wild, gay prelude -upon her harp, she sung(again. THE WARIMOR'S SONG. With a mettled steed, And a falchion bright, With aferless heart, ' And a brow of light, Ride, warrior, ride, Though thy course is dyed With the crimson tide, lide, warrior, ride!

Ride,- Warrior, ride, Though thy course is dyed With the crlmson tide, Ride, warrior, ride  T  fair -Jewess eased and the flushed fcoe and eager gaze of her auditor proved how much awake his soul was to the theme of glory. "Hadst thou lived in the days of the Cru- saders, fair lady, thou woUldst have nerved mant a warrioor' nrm -for the sacred cause!' sai4 Margman after she aeased. "Alas, thosee davs are past, and the Holy City is yet in the' hnds of the infidel!" re- plied mirriam. , "isf the song or tears of her daughters had been of much avail, Jerusalem wou{ not now be desolate  But the cloud is upon her, and many days will pass ere it is "Then thou art of those who believe thai   the glories of the Holy City will yet be re- vived!" ' "It is a part of our creed. Were it not for that hope, the doom of the Hebrew were dark, indeed! Persecuted bv all men-re- viled and hated-they know little of joy on earth." "All men do not hate thy race Some pity more than they hate." "IPty!" The jet-black eyes of the Jewess flashed like fire as she echoed this word. "Pity t" she cried. "Give us hate and cornI'II, but not so base a thing as pity t Pity the hound which howls when you scourge him-pity the slave which kisses the hand that smnites him ;. but pity us not, for we Set are proud amid all suffering and all persecu- tion.' ' Morgan thought that he never had seen any one so queenly, so majestically beautiful as this -daughter of, Judah, when she spoke these words.   In her excitement, she had risen firom her seat at the harp, and her tall, superb figure seemed to swell in height and fullness-the color rose richly to her brow, and her black eyes /lowLd with the 'intensity of flame.    / But in an instant she became subdued; and silnkinm to her seat, while her face was suffus- ed with btlushes, she said. in, a low, sad voice: "Forgive me, for I have forgotteli myself!" "It is I who should crave forgiveness, fair lady!" responded the young man.   "I who so rudely wounded thv feelings." "Spelak of it no more," said she, gently. "I hear my father's footsteps-he hans returned!' She was right. The next moment her fa- ther entered the apartment. At a  glance, she saw that his brow was clouded with anger. "What hath troubled thee, my   father?" she asked, anxiously. "Nothing of im)ort, dear child-nothing of import!" he replied. "A  dog whom  I have ted crossed my way, and -barked at me. It was folly in me to be nangry with him." ,' Thou speakest in metaplhor, dear father!" Well-it was the young Lord Percival, a gamester and spendthrift, to whom I have lent moneys on security. until his security has grown weak. I refus'ed to lentd him more; and he called me   a cursed Jew, and swore he would raise a mob to pull the roof down about mine enrs!" "The coward   hb( lbost keep his distance while Painn here!" cried Morgan, bittrly. "I  wopld give a purse of yellow gold for an opportunity to measure swords with him." "  Dost thou know him?" asked the Jew, in surprise.                 r "Ay--I know him well, and hate him fer- ] ventlv," replied the young man. "  But I 1 knew not that he was 'in London. .Ten days 1   e- agone I left him in Wales, following like a a spaniel in a lady's train." . ,t  " y?  I havc heard from his own lips e that lie expected to mend his broklen fortunes ,-' by wedding the heiress of some noble earl in n that direction." "He lied!" said Morgan, fiercely. "' Te y never will wed Helen of Caermarthen, while the sun gives light or the water runs!" "Ah! I can fathom the hate now, and its cause!" said the Jew," with a meaning smile. "If thou dost think that I love the lady, I thou art in error! I love her not; I am not : so w4kI as fo love-to love one so far above emy ril   as the daughter of the wealthiest earl in Waw s!" t  "Love levels rank!" said Miriam, gently, "And is not a fitting theme for tilee to'dis- course upon!" said her father quickly, and al- i most in a harsh tone. I  She felt the rebuke, for the Qcolor left lhrr cheek for an instant, and then came back with Ia ruddy flush, and hereyes were cast down. Morgan felt like defending her, but the Jew Igave him  no  opportunity so to do, for lie quickly turned the conversation to another point.?' 4Thou wilt need money irn this city--'tis a a  costly place to dwell in, AMaster Morgafi," said he. '"I  have enough for the pIesent," replied the latter.  "Perchance ; but I have instrluctions to fur- nish thee with whhat sums thou imalvest need. Be not backward in thy demands, for though I  am but a poor Jew, r cnn commalmnd 'a litleC gold for one who comes so well commended as thou!" "I shall only call upon thee when I  -need more;" replied Morgan.  "At   present, my greatest desire is to enter some service where I  can find advancement, and receive reward for my  service. I nam not a drone by nature, nor do I  care to subsist upon the 4indues of others." "Thy wishes do honor to thy head and heart. Master Morgan.  Lord Tareliff, to Whom thou bearest a letter, will be apt to aid thee. He is in favor with the court, and may obtain position for the, there." "A courtier's life will never suit me," said the young man, promptly.  "I would'rather go where there is play for my sword, than to wait in the train of a king or his no- bles. But since thou hnast remrrinded me of Lord Tarneliff, I will go to him and deliver my credentials. Be so kind as to bid my serv- ant attend me!" "Nay, do not lh in hnste, Master Morgan. Thou hast not yet dined; and though I   may - not feast thee so well as e, -yet'thou wilt find the Jew, Solomon, no niggard in his hospi- tality."   "Excuse me, friend Solomon-at another time I will trespass on thy kindness; and if thou and she permit, will come to listen to the rare music given by thy daughter!" "That \;hich gives pleasure to thee, will please us," responded the Jew, whose quick glance noticed that Miriam's color rose at the delicately-turned compliment to her music. Nor did it seem to please him; for he was more jealous of his child, or rather prized her more, than all his gold. Morgan's servant was called, and then after he had pledged the Jew and his lovely daugh- ter in a goblet of wine, the young man de- parted, being deferentially escorted to the threshold by the Jew, who there reiterated his offers of service, and invitations to again par- take of his hospitality. CHAPTER VIII. It was an easy task to find Lord Yarncliff, one of the most powerful nobles of the Court of Charles the Second; and Morgan soon stood in his presence. He had been announced by his command, as a messenger bearing lletter ; and when hoe entered the presence of tihed noble lord, at once delivered the packet which lie bone. The noble peer, who was in company with several others, glanced at the superscription, and then hastily broke the seal. His looks while lie read the letter, betokened interest and Ileasure derived from its contents- and after he had perused it, he siiloed and extended his hand to the bearer of it. "Cavaliers!" said he, to those around him, "this young gentlemnan is Master Heniry Mor- gan, whom I can conimend particularly to your goodl graces. I learn from an esteemed friend that lie is brave, well-skill.-d in arnims, and cour- teous. As such, he is entitled to our favor and all courtesy, and ye must initiate him gently into the ways of London." lThe gentlemen at once crowded up to the fine-looking young man, whose garb was full as rich nas that N'orn by .any of them, and whose manner was such as at once to impress them in his favor; and lie soon felt that he was neither a stranger nor friendless in tV:e great city. After a short time had been passed in thus forming an acluaintance, the peer excused himsalif to those around, requesting them to meet him in his banquet-hall' that evening, and then took young Morgan with him to his cabinet, to hohl a private interview. WhIen they were alone, Lord Yarncliff turned to Morg:in. and asked : "I How didst thou leave lv dear old friend, Sir William?" "Sir William? i do not understand thee, my lord!" said the young man, in surprise.   "Not undersiand me? Dost tlhou not know him who wrott the letter that I just received at thy hand?" asked the peer, impatiently. "I do, as a most noble ben-factor to me-- but if he has any other name besides that of Ethelbert the Hermit, I have not learned it. I have not sought to invade his mysteries or learn his secrets!" replied Morgan. The noble peer once more perused the letter. "Ah I here is a postscript which I had not noticed. Thou art right, young friend, and I was in error. Thy benefactor has another name, and a noble one; but there are reasons why it should not be known now, noreven his residence become known as being within the realm. -He says that thou art prudent: prove it by keeping 'his secrets, and thou wilt stand well with rme as with him." "I am no gossipmy lord, and my greatest anxiety is, at as early time as may be, to enter some service wliere I can find use for my sword. The world is a new school to me, and I am anxious to begin taking lessons in it." "Thy desire is praiseworthy, Master Mor-  gan,aand I will endeavor to aid thee therein. Where dost thou quarter?" "At an inn called the ' King's Arms,' my lord." !"Settle thy score there, and make thy home with me. I will order apartments prepared for thee. Thou needest make no excuse: thy introduction is a warrant for keeping thee near my person until an opening offers for tliy ad- vancement in some proper adiventure!" Thus invited-or, in truth, alnlost com- manded-the young man could not refuse to become the guest of the noble peer; and he, with grateful thanks, accepted the courtesy. CHAPTER IX. While thelhero of tl is story was ih attend- ance at the mansion of Lord Yarncliff, as re- lated in the previous chapter, a troublous scene was being enacted at the quarters of the Jew Solomon. The licentiouis and lawless Lord Percival was fulfilling, his threat, and endeavoring by force to extort the means which he could not otherwise ucquire from the money-lender. Morgan had not been gone froml the house more than half an hour, when heavy knocks on the door summoned the Jew to the wicket, whence he invariably took an observation of his visitors before 'he unbarred lifs strong door. To his dismay, he saw the young lord in the street, accompanied by a dozen or more of brawny ruffians, all armed, and in a city where Jewish persecution was ncever unpopular, at an hour of the night when no help might be hoped for: it need not be wondered at that he   was dismayed even though his doors were barred, and strong with oak and iron. "Jew, I am here!" cried the libertine lord, m he saw Solomon's- dark eyes gleam in the lttle wicket, reflecting back the light from one of the torches held by a ruffian near the d )or. "So I see, my lord; but this is no hour for business-come alone on the morrow, and I will at be home," said the Jew, with a tremu- lous voice. "Thou'rt at home now, and this is my time for business," replied Percival, scornfully. "Thou didst refuse to loan me money a short time agone-I have now come to borrow some without leave! Open thy door, and do it quickly, or we'll do it for thee!" "I have no money in the house. I have had it taken to a p'laee of safety-comae on the morrow, I pray thee, my lord," answered the Jew. "If that be so, open the door and give me and my friends entertainment." "Alas I ny lord, I have naught with which to entertain them. I am but a poor Israelite, whose fare is far too humble for thee and thy followers." "Lying dog! Open thy door within the time that I countten, or rue the consequences." The Jew made no reply, but his face wi:s no longer seei at the wicket. He had retired. For a few moments the young noble waited and listened for the sound of removing bars. But all was still. "The dog trusts to the strength of his door, and defies us!" he cried, at last. "Use your axes, men, and down with it!" Sonme of the brawniest of the ruffians, arm- od with the heavy axes used in battle in those days, advanced, and the oaken door :began to ring beneath their blows. But it was stout, and studded with iron, and the effect of their efforts was slow, and by no means sure. "C Why not set fire to the den, and burn the Piucy knave out, my lord?" asked one of the nen. "I do not wish to melt his gold,and there is a fairy within whose ebon tresses I would not scorch for a thousand sovereigns-I re- serve her for a happier fate, when once I lay my hands upon her. Her father shall dearly rue the day -when' he crossed the will of a Percival!" A low cry of pain and terror---a woman's ary, caused the dissolute noble to raise his eyes, and he saw that the sound haad come from a window in the upper story of the house, and knew well that his words had reached the ear of Miriam, the Jew's daughter. And a new thought entered his head-a thought which caused him to give a whispered order to two of his men, who hurried away to obey it. And the better to cover his future intentions, he   urged on his axe-men in their labor. But the door seemed to be proof against them, their axes broke, and at last one said: "We might as well hack at a castle wall, my lord! The iron is as thick as the wood, and tougher than our steel!" A mocking laugh was heard from within, and then the Jew cried, in a bantering tone: "Thou hadst better defer thy visit until to- morrow, Lord Percival. Tle night air is un- healthy."' At that moment, the two men who had been sent away returned with a long ladder, whi'ch was instIntly placed before the house, so as to reach the window above-three or four men rushed up its rounds, and in an instant a pierc- ing screari announced that they had effected an entrance at the unguarded point, for Miri- am saw them, and ,fled with a shriek to hide from the ruffians. "Now, good Jew, I think I have thee!" cried Percival, triumphantly. "Thy door is strong, but thou wert not soldier enough to guard all points of thy stronghold!" There was no reply, for the wretched Israel- ite had heard his daughter's cry, and heard the tramp of heavy footsteps over head, and with a groan of agony hurried to her aid. But 'he had only reached the inner room before described, when he met the ruffians of Percival, who seized and bound him before he could strike a blow with a dagger which he held. He looked for his daughter, and his only gleam of comfort was, that she was not in sight: she had hidden, he 'hoped, from view and was safe-for much as he loved his gold, he loved his only child still more. "Hasten to unbar the door, and let our no- ble master in. The-night air is unhealthy-- so said this dog a moment gone by," cried the one who had bound him, and tossed him help- lessly on the floor. The direction was at once obeyed; and in ad few moments the triumphant noble entered the gorgeous room with the rest of his band. "So, friend Solomon, wise namesake of a wise man, thou hast at last concluded to en- tertain us? Let vs see thou do it well, and then I will talk with thee on business. They tell me that thou hast choice wine in thy vaults for customers whose credit is good-I and my friends are thirsty. But thioH art bound-so was Joseph when his brethren sold him into slavery. Thou art not at Joseph- therefore thou shalt be' released. Unbind him, men; but guard him cloiely, and cleave him asunder if he dares to attempt an escape. We must have wine, and food, and music, good Jew-music from one of the sweetest voices ever heard in London. Where is the lovely Miriam?" "Beyond thy reach, accursed-beyond thb   reach!" said the Jew, grinding his teeth in rage, as he arose after being unbound. "Wilt thou give us the wine I demanded before I cut thy tongue out for its insolence?" said Percival, angrily. "We will drink, and then look for the missing beauty. Wine sharp- ens men's eyes."' ' I will get the wine, nml,rd; let me go for it " said the Jew, in a more humble tone ; but his black eyes gleamed like sparks of fire. "No-we will not trouble thee to go for it. Thou art too willing to serve us. I have known wine so prepared that it quickly weak- ened the strongest arm. One of my men will take those keys from thy belt, and, perchance, make a betterchoice of wine than thlou wouldst do. Go with Herbert three or four of you, and if you find wine or tireasure, bring it lith- or as you find it. And should you discover a rare Jewish beauty who answers to the name of Miriam, escort hier to my presence. Wine is tasteless, if beauty is not near to sparkle in eontrast!" The Jew attempted to resist their taking his keys; and in the struggle succeeded in snatch- ing a dagger from the belt of one of his op- ponents; but ere he could raise it, a brutal blow from the heavy hilt of Percival's sword on his bare head, streteced him bleeding and senseless on the floor. A wild shriek of agony rung through the roomn; and out from behind some heavy tap- catry, which concealed a sniall recess, sprung poor Miriam-who, as she threw herself upon hdr knees, and lifted up the bleeding head of her father, cried, in wild agony: "Murdered - murdered? God of Abra- ham! is there no mercy in men? My father is murdered!" Scarcely has the words passed from  her lips, when the heavy tramp of a man was bheard coming from the outer door, and she saw the forms of Henry Morgan and his stal- wart servant; and, with a cry of joyous hope, sank down upon hr father's body.   Whitt passed thenceforwa!rd for some moments, was to her like a wild and terrible dream. She heard the clash of steel, the shouts of angry men, and, more than once, the fall of men around her; and when a gush of warm blood, spouting from  some fearful wound, came hot as fire upon her, she fainted. When she recovered, she found it was through the exertions of her wounded father, who, with Henry'Morgan and the negro, Ma- lnk, were the only living occupants of the room, beside herself. But upon the floor, ghastly with their death- wounds, were stretched four of Percival's ruffians. He, with the rest, had fled from theo  most fierce encounter he had ever mingled in; : for Morgan, fighting like a madman, seconded,   all as desperately by the gigantic negro, who had seized an axe from a ruffian, had crushed his foes'down as if they were reeds upon the river side. "Saved-saved! And by thee!" she mnur- mnured, as her eyes opened, to meet the glance of the young hero. And she threw herself upon her knees before him, before lie could prevent it, aad kissed his hands, while the hot tears gushed in torrents from  her jetty eyes. "Rise, lady-rise! I thank God that for- tune has enabled me to do thee andi thy father a service; but I need no thanks.' My work is most done.  The cowardly villain who planned this wrong has scaped Ily'sword for this'timne; but it shall not be long ere he re- ceives justice. I will hasten to Lord Yr'n- cliff, and with him go to the king, and then'e ask that he receive the reward due to a cow- ard and a thief!" '"Oh! leave us not, noble friend!-leave us not amid these horrors 1" cried the maiden, ns she shudderingly looked around her. "Malak, drag out that carrion, and cast it in the street!" said Morgan, pointing to the dead tian. "Not so-r-not so; or even the power of tle king would not save me, were he not himsell present. If a Christian's body were found if the street before the house of a Jew, the peso ple would not leave one stone upon anothi' In that ho se " said Solomon.  "Oh I thud, the king could know how we are persecuted .,. sach wrongs as this would not be done; fern 'tis said his heart is good!" "Who told thee that his heart was good l" asked a stern voice at the door. And the speaker, who was richly habited, and accom- panied byftwo others-all three armed and masked-entered the room. "It is his voice-it is the lINO!" said the Jew. And he sunk upon his knees. "What does all this mean?" asked the first speaker, turning to Morgan, who stood leannig upon the sword which he had raised from the floor, at the entrance of the stran- gers. "It means that there lie four out of near a dozen men who, healed by a noble-a lord of the realm-sought to rob and murder this old man; and to do a wrong more deep upon his only child!" said Morgan. "Speak less boldly; it is the king " said the Jew. "Silence!  The king is but a man!" re- plied the monarch ; for it was, indeed, Charles II., who often took a midnight ramble, so dis- guised that he could pass unknown. Scarcely had the king's words to the Jew left his lips, when the noise of loud voices and hurried footsteps were heard outside. "They are returning, in more strength, for   revenge, perhaps. Had not your majesty better retire!" said Morgan, respectfully. "Not I; if there is to be a battle, I will see it out. But, on your lives, gentlemen all, do not betray my rank or name. I shall not un- mask!" Morgan made no reply, but stopped nearer the door; while Malak, seizing again his blood-stained axe, stood close by his side. "Take that lady to a s fer place, Jew!" said the monarch, who had cast more than one admiring glance on the pale, yet very lovely Jewess. The steps were now close at hand; and scarce a second elapsed ere the entrance was full of armed men, urged on-but not led-- by Lord Percival. "Back!-back, if ye love life!" cried Mor- gan, as the foremost hesitated on the thresh- old. "O Charge upon the varletI Revenge your comrades, and the Jew's treasure is all your own!" cried Percival, in the rear. The incentive was enough; the men rushed on-rushed on to death; for while the sword of Morgan pierced the heart. of one, the axe of Malak clove another to the chilne.  But as these fell, others pressed on; and in a mo- ment, more, Morgan and his servant were forced back from their first position, and the battle became more unequal. "Now a blow   for God and Saint George, gentlemen!" cried the king.  And, to the as- tonishment of Percival, he saw that Morgan had received a reinforcement as well as him- self. Desperate at the thought of a second de- feat, he no longer held back; but rushed mad- ly into the fray, and soon found himself face to face with Morgan. And the other combat- ants, seeming to feel willing that the two leaders should decide the fate of the melee, drew back, and watched, even as they would at some knightly tournament, the skill of the twain. Percival was not a despicable foe so far as skill went; but he lacked the nerve which all men have who fight for right instead of wrong, and in a  few brief minutes he was disarmed, and at the mercy of his foe. He  turned to fly; but his foot slipped in the blood which lay thick upon the floor, and he fell prostrate at Morgan's feet. The latter put his foot upon his neck, and; in a tone of the bitterest contempt, said: "  Wert thou better than a dog, I would slay thee. Live, to remember that my plebeian foot has pressed thy noble neck 1" "By my crown, thou art as noble as the no- blest knight in my realm!" cried the king- forgetting, in his admiration of the young man's valor and conduct, his own desire to have the secret of his rank unknown.   Instantly, every knee in the room was bent, save one; for the king unmaslked his face when the words weree spoken. Lower than all cowered Lord Percival, who had started to his feet as the foot of Morgan left his neck, with a bitter determination to die or slay his in- sulter. The one who did not kneel was Henry Morgan. He never before had stood in the presence of a king, knew naught of court ceremony, and, as a victor, felt himself as good as any who stood beneath that roof. The King smiled as he looked upon the youth. He was not displeased with his manly demeanor; for it was a new thing in his presence. "Art thou of noble blood?" he asked. "I am the youngest son of an honet Welsh squire, your majesty!" was the reply. "Wllhat dost thou in London?"  - "I came hither to seek some service, where my sword might carve for me an honorable name, and keep me from want!" "Thou hast commenced well;' but thou wieldest thy sword too well for a comlmoner. Where didst thou learn thy skill -inarmns?" "I was a man-at-arms under the noble Eat i of Caermarthen ; and left his service because I would not humble myself to the craven lord whose neck was but now beneath my foot 1" "Ah I thou hast met him  before? - Thy name?" "Henry Morgan, your majesty." "Kneel down, Henry Morgan-seest thou. not that thou alone art standing before me I "I obey your majesty's commands," aid the youth; but he colored as he knelt, for ma- ture seemed to tell him that 'twas wrong for man to kneel to man. The king advanced a step, and laying his naked sword lightly upon the young man's shoulder, said, in a voice which thrilled -like- heaven's music through that young and am- bitious heart: "Rise, SIa HENRY MORGAN, and henceforth * prove thou a good and loyal knight, worthy of the spurs which my Lord Chamberlain here  present will take from the heels of thy king to place on thine!" !So sudden a realization of one of his bright- eat dreams-a change from his position as a poor commoner to that of a belted. knight, so made by the king's own hand, almost over- - powered our hero; and not until he felt the noble buekling on the spurs of knighthood on his heels, could he recover strength to pour forth his grateful, almost tearful thankse and - to vow that he would ever hold his life eheap when offered in his majesty's service. The king made no reply to these words his eye and thoughts were upon Lord Perai. val, who did not dare leave his presence un- bidden.  And if contempt in t ghlane could'   sink a man beneath the earth, it is wonderful that the recreant lord did not disappear. Not deigning to even speak his name, the king waved his hand and said: "Begone-fer the sake of those akin to thee, and of the rank thou bearest, I give ihee four-and-twenty hours in which to leave the realm. And if thou dost enter it again without our express comwtnd, thy head shall be the firfeit!"  The humbled lord was but too glad to es- cape on any terms, and, followed by his hand, shrunk away like a whippedo cur from the royal presence. The king now turned to Morgan again, and asltd if he had any friends who belonged to the ourt. "I bore a letter to Lord Yarnoliff," replied the young knight, " and having delivered it this evening, was-invited by the noble lord to dwell with him until I found such service as I desired." "Thou hast a noble and knightly friend. Come thcu with him to our audience to-mor- row-tell him it is the king's command." Morgan' bowed his obedience; and the king, with his attendants, resuming their masks, departed.   - CHAPTER X. The king hd scarcely left the threshold, when Solomon and his daughter entered, and their words of congratn'ation at once told our hero that they had been unseen witnesses to the last seene in that room. The Jew first hurried to bar the outer door; and then re- trning, begged the young knight to go with 1,im and his daughter into another apartment of his spacious dwelling, while he procured *id for f Maslk, ;o that the terrible traces of that night-' fry might, so far as possible, be r  ,moved. He did not now fear, as he had wiue, the danger which might occur from a knowledge of Christians having fallen beneath his roof; for befelt aauted of thhe proteaion of th kig-- h, avingwh himself drawn at wew. pon in his cause, would never permit him to be persecuted for anything whiac had occur- red there. The room which they entered, preceded by Miriam, whost face had resumed its color, for the iwo of terror, no longer from her veins, was yet wreo-elegantly furnished than that in which the Jew first introduced his daughter to his gues  lt tpiotures, ith drapry, its bvt- mentO-all prolaimed it to be theicdow of Solomon^ air daughter.    -1: Rer- pointing to an ottoman ..-the Jew asked Sir Henry to, be seatewhile lMiriam procured refreshments. It was so new to our here to be oaled Sir Henry, that he could not realize that the words of Solomon were addresed to him. A.'*   "Thou wilt now neei money to sustain thy knightly position, and to buy thee such ward- e robe and gear as will fit thee to appear at court," said the Jew. "I shall not receive a o refusal this time, Sir Henry, for I owe more to e thee than I ever can repay. I might have e been penniless, if not dead, and, worse than all, my child had been dishonored,jiad not 1i thy sword saved us!" "The debt is not all on thy side, good Sol- - omen," said Morgan, with a smile. "Had , not this chance been thrown in my way by my visit to thee, the spurs of knighthood had not now graced my heels! I am in thy debt, I and not thou in mine. Yet I will accept a D loan ere long, when my purse gets low-hop- ing soon to repay it." "Thankl, Sir Henry-thanks!" t  Miriam, entering with wine, changed the D conversation; anil after draining a cup with his guest, the Jew begged him to remain until his return, and left the room to aid Malak and the servants in tleir work. While her father had been present, Miriam had seemed careless and cheerful; for she re- membered his warning words, and knew that no feelings of gratitude or anything else could induce him to countenance her love for one outside of the Hebrew faith; and she knew, also, that his watchful eye was on her every look and action-his car listening to every word she uttered. But now, alone with him whom ler heart already clung to, she did not try to still her heart's wild throb- bings, but let the tide of love thrill over its untrodden pathway. Understand me -she spoke no word of love-by no action over- stepped the bounds of modesty-but the trem- bling lip, the heaving bosom, the eye almost tearful with a new-born joy, which never but for an instant met his gaze, ere it was veiled beneath its long, black lashes-all told that she was enjoying the delicious dream of a first love.  And did'Sir Itenry Morgan understand her feelings? He did not; for although he fan- ced he had loved the Lady Helen, he was a novice in a study of that passion which rules one-half the world, while hate rules the other. He admired the beauty of Miriam-felt that it was pleasant to be iin her company. That was all; 1e was courting a new bride--Fame; andhe had advanced One-step in her favor. His ambition was already trampling down all thoughts of love. He looked forward-not back to the hours when he had worshiped 6he Lady Helen of Caermarthen. The Jew was absent for some time, but it seemed searie a moment to poor Miriam,whom Sir Henry had endeavored to cheer' and en- tertain by a description of his home in wild and romantie Wales. She could have listened   to his voice forever, she thought, nor asked for sweeter music. When Solomon returned, he begged his guest to accept a chamber for the remainder of the night, and to rest; but Sir Henry, wishing to be prepared early for the audience with the king, excused himself, and instaisted on returning to his inn. Miriam, upon hearing his determination, made a whispered request of her 'father, to which the latter, after a moment's hesitation, assented, and she left the room. In a few mo- ments she returned, and laying a magnificent dianmnd star upon the table before him, said: "My father and myself desire our benefac- tor to wear this sym!bol of our gratitude- may his star of destiny never be clouded!' Morgan looked upon the princely gift-for it was of immense value-and would have de- clined it, but a beseeching look from the maiden cheeked the intention, and fastening it by its pin and chain upon his breast, He said: "It shall be worn above my heart in re- membrance of those who gave it, and the hour when God gave me a chance to serve them!    - s He then bade Miriam a gentle adieu, and was accompanied by the Jew to the door, where the faithful .Malak awaited his comn. CHAPTER XI. Lord Percival, when he was dismissed in his shame from the presence of the king, hurried to the house in which he held his quartes, for his old family-mansion had already passed from his hands to pay some of his gambling bets, Only one person accompanied him, for his discomfited band of ruffians, picked up in different quarters, had sought their various dens. The man who went with him was one of those convenient panders to the licentious'- who are ever to be found in great cities hang- ing upon the outskirts of those who will sup- port them ; ready for any crime; full of de- ceit, treachery', and guile; always willing to change masters for better pay, or to turn trai- tor at the sight of a purse of gold, This man-Brompton was his name-had for a long time hung to the fortunes of Lord Percival; for he had been useful to the latter, and had been treated liberally, was not yet quite ready to desert him, for"the young lord had some property left, and yet more in ex- pectance. And he (Brompton) had not yet his service. Not thathe wasemployed inany regular capacity-he only acted when called upon to do some foul work or other, and draw on Percival forall the funds he needed to keep him in food, drink, clothing, etc., making. an occasional strike at the ganming-table on his own account. In dress, education, and man.   ners, he managed to pass among gentlemen as a member of society--that is, the society which gentlemen of pleasure and leisure form for'themselves-.-but such a nman as he would have been kicked from the door of Lord Takn. cliff, or any of the truly noble families of the kingdom. When Lord Percival reached the sitting- room of his house, he threw himself into a chair, with a bitter curse on his lips. Brompl ton, seeming to think that spiritual consola- tion was needed by the young lord, hastened to the side-board ;and pouring-out two brim- ming goblets of brandy, drank off one him. self and carried the other to Prerival, who emptied it a draught. "I Another!" he cried, extending th9 empty goblet. "With hell-fire ragiug in my heart, the spirit of hell alone will quanch it!" "Excuse me, my lord: thy head should be cool now, for I err much if thou wilt let the insults of this night go unpulnishedel' cried Brompton. "Fill that goblet again," thundered Pere?. val. Brompton did so, and a second time it was emptied by the young noble. "t I feel better now," ihe snid, a few momenta afterward. "I feel better--my brain does nct reel; I can and will be calm-calm to study out a future which shall be dark and bloody for more than one who has crossed my patl. The insults of this night shall not pass unto. warded. But I am banished!" "And wilt thou go, my lord?" "I must, or lose my head! Charles the First could be change-d-Charles the Secoud is another man!" "My lord might leave the kingdom-go to France, and return in a few days so disguised that every plan of revenge he formed could ye carried out under his own eyes 1T" "Brompton, the. thought givs me now life.-. Thou wilt not desert me Y" "Never, my lord; never while life lasts 1" replied Brompton. He might have used the word money instead of life, and then his fidelity could have been insured. "It is well. I shall trust all to thee. In plans, thou hast no master. Plan thou for my disguises--plan all for me but my revenge. I have but a little time in which to arrange my pecuniary resources, for they must be as com- plete asjf I had left the kingdom for life." i. "They can be easily arranged," said the wily Brompton. "Make me thy agent, give me the power to receive, collect, transfer, etc., and I can keep funds ever at thy control," "True ; it shall be so," said the troubled peer, not doubting the honesty of one who was " willing to die for him." "And now, my lord, to the plans. Let me   advise th cparture by to-morrow night for France; and let it be as public as possible. After thy departure, as thy agent and by thy orders. I shall sell the furniture of this house, thy horses. hounds, etc. at auction, and con- vert them into cash. Tthis I will deposit with a banker, or keep it for thee until thy return, which may be within a week if thou art well disguised. Meantime, I will keep an eye on this new-made knight, have h;s steps watched, and learn his intentions. Also will I learn how the Jew and his lovely daughter prospers, and make all ready for thy work, for well do I know that they three must fall beneath the blaze of thy anger!" "They and one more-one mbre, if it costs myr head!" ' One more, my lord? Thou dost not mean the king?" "I do. Hath he not wronged me more than all the rest? Iath he not knighted a low*born varlet, whose foot he tamely saw pressing the neck of a peer of his realm  Hath he not for the sake of n Jew money-l nd- er and his baby-faced girl banished a l'erci- val from the kingdom? King though ha be, he shhall rue the -lay when he made me his foe." "My lord, were these words overheard-" * I would not unsay them, were my head on the block and the herdsman by my side. But I shall not deal with the head of my of- fenders, until the reist have been swept away. First, the epringalt Morgan shall bite the dust --next, the Jew and his Rose of Sharon-then, then I will think of-treason!" "And then," muttered Brompton to himself, "my fortune will be made; for a king pays well forta secret that affecta his life." Tlhe young lord, aS he closed the impetuous revelation of his plans, arose, and again filled a goblet of liquor and drank it off. But Brompton was too cautious to follow bis example, though at most times he was but too ready to do justice to the flagon. It is strange, yet nevertheless true, that men suffering under deep mental torture, or an excitement amounting to desperation, can driink quantities of liquor which at other times would not only intoxicate, but kill them- drink such quantities without feeling any ap- parent effect. Even as in cases of intense bodily pain. The writer once knew a man, while undergoing the amputation of two shat- tered limbs, to drink, by permission of the surgeons, who scarcely hoped for life, but wished him to bear up, two bottles of pure old t brandy, and he did not exhibit then, or after, any signs of intoxication. Thus much to explain what otherwise might seem impossible or unnatural with Lord Per- cival. But it is time  to bring this chapter to a elom, whiob we do, leaving Brompton and   his patron to conclude their plans as they may. CTIAPTER XII. Lord Yarncliff was not one of that class of England's nobles who contradict the rules of Nature by rioting all night and sleeping all day: his habits were regular; therefore when, at an early hour in the day, our hero arrived at his mansion, and requested an audience, the worthy peer was ready to receive him. It seems as if any promotion, or zany ad- vancement of man in life-I mean of a true man, not a man-monkey-adds to his pefsond/ dignity, as well as to his temporal position. Take from among your hired laborers one worthy of the post and make him your fore- man, his eye beams with a bright intelligence, his step is more firm, his look and voice tell that he feels himself a step upward in life, and his manhood strengthens with the encourage- ment. When Henry Morgan entered the presence of Lord Tarncliff, dressed with unusual care, the diamond star upon his breast, and the gold- en spurs of knightlhood on his heels, the peer, without looking at his dress, knew from his proud and joyous look--an exprt ssil,n in which dignity modest, but yet VNattre's dig- nly, conuld be. seen-that some change had come over the fortune of the ryoung man-a change which had, in a fevd brief hours, added years of manhood to his nature. Morgan had purposely refrained from send- ing his name with a title prefixed to the peer: he was yet Henry Morgan to him, the young adventurer seeking friends and service. "I am glad to see thee, Master Henry!" said the peer. "Glad that thou hast accepted my invitation, rnd found thy way to my man- sion, there to quarter during thy stay in Lon. don. Thou lookest well and happy, as if some good news had come to thee!" "Good news have come to me, my lord!" replied the young knight. "Such news as will make all that care for me rejoice. But I have a message to thee, my lord, which I must first deliver - a command from his majesty, King Charles i" "A  command from the king? Art thou mad, young man "' cried the noble, in utter astonishment. Then perceiving the spurs upon his heels and the star upon his breast, he rose; and while a flush of indignation darkened his noble Afte, he added:  4 Who art thou, air, that purporting to be a poor Totng man in queat of service, now ape pear as a knight. Donbtles thou art in a plot to betray him whom last night thou pretend- ed not to know, and called thy benefactor I Who art thou, air?Speak, for f am not used to maaquerading!"   Morgan received this burst of indignation from the noble peer with a calm quie-t, which spoke well for the strength of his nerves, and when the other hlad concluded, replied: "I wear no mask, pord Tarncliff, 'nor have I yet appeared in any character or garb but that whichQwas rightly mine own! Last night I was Henry Morgan, the liumble bearer of a letter of introduction to thy lordship! To-day I am Sir Henry Morgan, the bearer of a command from the king, that Lord Tarn- cliff accompanies me to an audience with his majesty, at the iaual hour of reception!" Sir Henry Morgan, didst thou say?"  "Ay, lay lord, and knighted by the king's own hand i" "In the name of all the saints, explain, for I cannot comprehend thee!" Our hero wished no longer to mystify his noble friend, and lie at once explained, inwhrief and Imodest language, all the events of the pre- ceding niht. The peer listened in silence until all was told. Then he rose, and Tressing the hand of his young guest, said: "God is willth ee, Sir Henry! With King Chllarles for a patron, my friendship is but a a secondary matter, scarce needed by thee, yet will I persist in asking the first place in thy confidence, and to be the first to aid thee in all honorable desires!'  1 I thank thee, my lord, and can only say, that as my first friend in London, I shall over look to thee for advice and friendship, and while I abide by the first, will strive to deserve the last!" "I have no doubt of that. Thou must be on the guard now, for though Percival is banished, lie has friends. bad men, it is true, yet friendils who may, by h is direction, seek for 'vengeance. I would advise thee, after we have seen the king, to leave. London for a few weeks!" "i My lora, ly sword can protect me any- where!" "; Npt from poison, not from a thousand meann which hot vengeance can invent. But when hate and rage grow cool, they are not so dangerous. Now bethink thee how, 'twould glad'thy old father to see his younger son a nighlt, beneath his roof-tree, and the proud earl who discarded thee for the sake of tlhis wretch, Percival, will feel humbled when lihe knows that thy worth is appreciated by the king, while the villainy of his daughter's suitor is exposed and punished. And thy first bene- factor will rejoice--" "Thou hast said enough, my lord - more than enough to make me yearn to visit Wales once more before I enter some service where I can prove myself worthy of the spurs I wear! Only seek to find me that service while I am absent, and I will, with the king's permission, visit my birth-place once again!" / l   "I am glad of thy conclusion, Sir Henry I While I prepare for our visit to the king, thou canst amuse thyself in my library. I see that thou art already fitly dressed for the audi- ence."' CHAPTER XTII.'v Kings so seldom perform generous actions from thajmpulses of their, hearts, that it is net strange that they should make a knowledge of them ,public, in most cases. FIor, to an almost unlimited extent, policy, rather than generosity. is the rule by which all goveranments arj guided.        . The reception which the king gave to Sir Henry Morgan, might have been in his pri vate cabinet, and probably would have been, had he been some knight already known, or even a peer asking some favor; but the king had found a hero, and knighted him for his heroism, and wished his court, and through that, all the realm to know it. There was a spice of selfishness in thllis, for he well knew that thousands of young men, hearing of the advancement of one from hum I le life, on ac- count of his valor, would strive to emulate his example, in hopes of attiining his suc- cess. Therefore, in full state, with noble lords and dames around him, he received our hero, who, accompanied by his friend, Lord Tarnclih, knelt at the foot of his throne. He extended his hand to the young kni]ght, who pressed it to his lils., and then the monarch rose, and nanmed Sir Henry Morgan, to the court, as one deserving every friendship at their hands, for his heroism and good attributes. "I Knighted by our own hand," said the kin,t " advanced from humble life for his owni merit,'let no noble of my court slight him, on pain of our displeasure!" Then looking at the face of the young hero covered with blushes, for now lie felt moro like a bashful maiden than a man, the king continued: "What favor can .we grant our- young knight? Let him ask boldly, we will not be chary. of our power!" "My Lord Tarncliff will speak for me, your majestv. He was my first friend ; and his age and wisdom vill, yet make him, my best ad- viser!" "Thou hast spoken wisely-there is no no- ble in my realmf  more honored than thy friend "what saith he for thee?" "Sir Henry seeks serrice, your mnjesty, serv- ice in which he can prove that the nobility given by his king has been well bestowed. But he requires a few weeks of preparation; and then, should it please vour majesty, he will be ready for anv enterprise which may be laid before him!" replied Tarncliff. "He shall have the time, sud meanwhile, \   we will think of some fitting field for his CrOi It" The audience was closed, and the young knight, attended by his noble friend, moved along amid the throng of noble lords and ladies, receiving introductions and congratlu- lations on every hand. And with as fine a face and figure and a bearing full as courtly as that of any noble there, it is not wonderful that he received many an admiring glance, many an encouraging smile, and even flatter- ing words from fair ones 1present, whose rank was higther yet than that of her to whom he had given his first young heart's worship. More than one noble, whose pedigree ran back for centuries, was then and there in his heart obliged to acknowledge that Nature raade nobles, not Time or heritage.' CHAPTER XIV. With most friendly foresight, Lord Yarn- cliff had procured from the king a letter com- mending the gallant knight, Sir Henry Mor- gan, to the favor of the Earl of Cacrmarthen, and bearing this with another from the noble lord to Ethelbert the Hermit, Sir Henry was slowly riding along the very pathway where st he met the hermit, some ten days after -.ie ime evented in our last chapter. Behind him rozle Malak, and another servant, having each a led horse, with the baggage of their master, for he could not now travel quite so I ly fitted as he went forth from that region. The young knight rode slowly, for his thoughts were wandering over the past, which every scene around him brought to mind. suddenly his horse started, as if frightened, and he raised his eyes from the ground upon wfhich he had been looking, to see the cause. Before him, almost in the narrow spot Where he formerly overthrew Percival's serv- ant, stood his old benefactor, dressed as poorly as before. At a glance, Sir Henry saw that Ethelbert did not wish a recognition, but stood aside to let him pass. At midnight, I will be with thee to explain all!" the young knight whispered, as he rode by toward the castle. Malak saw his old master, also, but he was too well trained to do otherelso than Sir Henry had done. This was not the only meeting which fate had in store for the young knight ere he reached the castle gates. As he, riding on more rapidly, approached the bridge which spanned the rushing  stream  from which, years before, he had lrescued the earl's daugh- ter. lie discovered Lady Helen, with some fe- male a' tenlants, standing upon it. The lady was leaning ovpf the rude parapet of wlne bridge, looking- Into the foamy waters below. What were her thoughts--why stood she   there-was her mind, like his, wandering back over the past? This occurred to his mind; and then came the menlory of her cold and haughty demeanor when they last parted at the foot of the waterfall. And if tender thoughts and fond emotions had begun to swell his heart, when he first glanced upon her, and thought of the past, the last mnem- ory brought in pride to drive them. back and chill them down : he felt that he had no longer need to look up to her, that at least he wnas her equal; and, driving his spursdleeper into the flanks of his horse, he galloped on. Aroused by the sound of clattering hoofs, the, lady raised her head; and turning, saw at a glance, that it was a knight who ap- proached. His plumed cap, his golden spurs, the diamond,-star gleaming like fire upon his breast, each were tokens of his rank. The bridge was narrow, and hts horse had to be reined down into a walk to safely pass the ladies. She saw, and with wonder recog- nized his face, now pale and haughty--not blushing as it once was, whenever she looked upon it.  She would have spoken to him. But he, without an apparent look of recogni- tion, raised his plumed cap, as any courteous knight would do, in passing a lads, and rode on, not speaking a word, closely followed by his attendants, toward the castle gate. "Didst thou ever see that knight before?" v she asked, as she leaned, half fainting, against the parapet. * Never as a knight, lady," replied the at- tendant, to whom her question had been ad- dressed ; *" but if that knight be not the same Henry Morgan who rescued thee from the stream which flows beneath- us, I never will kpow a man by his face again." "It cannot be! -He has been gone but a few weeks-there is no war in whichi he could have won knighthood so speedily!" said the lady. "It must be some other, yet the like- ness is most strange. If it had been he, he would have spoken to me, or by sonw look had shown that he knew me," she added, in a lower tone to herself She did not think that her power over him was weakened. Women, or at least some of themr, believe that "when once they have brought a manly heart within the circle of their enchantment, they can keep it there forever, no matter how much they wrong it-- how they may trample upon or trifle with it. In short, that a man to them, is something like a dog, which, once attached, will never leave its master, though beaten and abused-that he can be driven the length of his chain, and then be whistled back again. You err, fair enslavers--err greatly; for a heart worth possessing will not be trifled with, nor be tyrannized over. Tyranny is death to love, even as it is to liberty. But    this fs another of my mind's wanderings, aside from the story-track. The lady watched the knight until he had passed inside of the castle gate, and then she slowly followed with her attendants. God,   CHAPTER XV. tarl Cedric was in his cabinet, engaged with the steward of his estates in overlooking his yearly accounts, when a servant entered, and announced that a knight had arrived in the 'court-yard below, who stated that he bore a letter from the king to the earl. "Receive him, with all honor, and usher him to the grand saloon," said the earl;. "I will be there to receive him." The noble hastened to meet the king's mes- senger ; for, in that day, a monarch's message was generally of grave import, and not, as now, a matter frequently of mere oompli- ment. As he entered the upper end of the saloon, the knight, attended by several of the earl's household, came in by another door below, and advanced to the spot where he stood.             ..i The earl did not at first recognlze the knight; but as the latter raised his cap, and his well-known features were seen:unshaded, the earl uttered a cry of .surprise; and while a look of doubt settled on his face, he said: "Do I see Henry Morgan before me again?" '"Sir Henry Morgan, if it please thee, my lord-the bearer of a letter from the king!" replied our hero, looking the earl in the eye, while a proud smile stole over his own face. And advancing, he reached a package, seal- ed with the royal signet of England, to the earl. The latter bowed reverently, as he took the letter, and his hand trembled when he opened it. Many a change came over his face while he read its contents-ehangeq from doubt to surprise, from surprise to shame- shame for his past conduct to one whom he now must treat as a friend and noble, to one who was and ewr had proved himself so worthy of his kindness and esteem. "Lord Percival banishied-banished for in- famous condnct-a libertine, gamester, and ruined spendthrift!" he muttered. '"And I would have given my daughter tohim I And Henry knighted by the king's own hand! Can it be real! It is in the king's own writing-: sealed with the royal seal." But he seemed in an instant to feel that there was more than ordinary attention due to the messenger of the king, if not to Henry Morgan, as a gentleman and a knight; and, folding up the letter, he said to the butler of the castle, who stood near: ' Have refreshments nimediately served in Sir Henrv's apartments, and prepare for a banquet of welcome to our guest to-night." To another officer of his household, he gave   orders for the preparation of the best rooms in the castle for the knight; and then, with more than usual courtesy of demeanor, he begged the young knight to accompany him to the sitting-room usually occupied by him in his hours of leisure. ' "I have reason to offer thee my sorrowful apologies, for the manner of our last parting, Sir Henry," said he ; " while I heartily con- gratulate thee on thy, doubtless, well-merited advancement to knightly rank, and his majes- ty's favor." "Speak not of the past, my lord-to me there is no past. Every memory of it is blotted out, and I only look forward into thp future-I hope,- a glorious future!" There was one who heard that the memory of the past was blotted out, wlose heart sunk, and whose cheek turned, white-for she now knew that it was Henry Morgan who spoke. Lady Helen was already in the room, and her father and his guest were crossing the thresh. old, when the latter replied to the earl's min- gled apology and congratulations. "Helen, we have an old friend in a new guest.. This is Sir Henry Morgan, knighted by the king for his virtue and valor! Dost thou not recornize him P' said the earl, pre- senting the young knight, who was as calm and self-possessed as if his heart never liad trembled in her presence, or quivered with alternate hope and fear at the sound of her voice. 's It were, indeed, strange, my father, if I should forget him who saved my life But he seems to have forgotten me " said the lady, advancing, and offering her hand. Morgan took the small, jeweled hand, and bowed his head till his lips touched it; and then, with a voice in which she sought vainly to detect the tremor of feeling, replied: "I had not forgotten the Lady Helen, nor the respect which is due from one of my hum- ble extraction to one so noble by birth as her- self!" "Speak not of that, Sir Henry," said the earl, hastily-wishing, if he could, to redeem his past injustice by present kindness. "One whom the king has ennobled need never look back to his birth with regret. Feel that we are but thy equals, and that this castle is thy home so long as thou wilt remain. We are honored by thy presence!" "I thank thee, my lord. My stay will be brief; I shill but rest my wearied horses, and then visit my father's house. After that, I re- turn, by the king0s command, to undertake some adventure which he has chosen for me ere this, I am led to believe!" "Thou wilt stay some'days, at least 1" urgec the earl. "Stay until I can assemble ;ny friends and vassals to a grand banquet, for I would fain have them sec that, under his gra.   cious majesty, valor and merit will find ad- vancement, no matter whence it springs!" "t If I can be of aervioe,to the king by re- maining, I will stay 1" said Morgan, coldly; for he felt that there was selfishness even in the earl's courtesy. "Thanks, Sir Henry--thank! Daughter Helen, here is a letter whieh our guest hath borne thee from the king. I will leave it with thee to peruse, and also leave thee to entertain him, while I go to see if fill hath been done as I ordered for his refreshment and com- fort." Tiie earl handed her the letter, and left the room. T,he young knight] seated near her, watched the expression of tier countenance while she perused the communication; and it may be that some of the former feeling for her - began to steal baek into his heart; fir he surely thought she had never looked Bo beau- tiful before. A cry of pleasure broke from"her lips, as she read one portion'of the letter: - "Percival is banished in disgrace t Thank Heaven for that!" she cried, not for a moment seeming to think that another was present to hear her words. "Waits he not thy suitor, lady, and engaged to thee in marriage?" asked Sir Henry, in surprise at her words.     I 'My suitor? Yes! But I with my own consent engaged to wed him? -- Nvcr I I scorned and lhated him-and he knew it; but would have used my father's authority to Wtrge a union, hand he not been found out by his king to be what I always knew him-a villain! My faither was blind o; his faults; I was not." Morgan made no reply to these words, and the lady concluded the perlsal of the letter. When she had done, sire said: "' It gladdens my heact to see thee advancing so rapidly in the path which ones thou didst sav throu wonld follow, Sir Harry; but I fear that tollou wilt push on so fast and so far that thou wilt indeed forget all tihe past, as thou hast said thou would!" "t There are memories which we cannot tear from our hearts, strive as we may!" said the young knight. And his voice now trembled for the first time.. The lady only answered with a sigh. It seemed as -if she did not dare to trust her lips to reply. Her eyes were cast down until the long lashes lay drooping on her cheek, and her bosom rose and fell like an otan swelling with the first breathingB of a storm. Earl Cedric entered at this moment, to es- cort his guest to his apartments : No sooner were they gone, and the Lady Helen left alone, than her heart's flood-wates gave way, and tears gushed in torrents from her eyes. Her sobs seemed to shake the very li* from her body. But tears made her more calm, and   then she gave utterance to the thoughts which filled her heart: "I He loved me when he was so hlumble that I dared not let him see the heartlthen all his own  Now, when he might well dare to speak of love, and ask for mine, ay, and for my hand, he loves me nct! And 'tis all mine own fault. My pride froze the love in his heart; .and now he hath pride to turn back the bitter flood .upon myself. O Henry!- Henry!w thou hast mercy in thyf heart, thou wilt pity"me yet!" Thus, for a time she wept and raved, and then she became more callm, determining to do all that .a modest woman could, to win back the young heart which she believed she had chillel into coldness.  CHAPTEI    XVI. Once more back to an old mental camping- ground, friend reader. Exquse my expres- sions-I write front the woods; nnt ththe camp is uppermost in my mind if I want to locali; c anything. In other words, we will lobk into the sub- terrancan palace of Ethelbert the lierslit once more. Coraline; his lovely daughter, sat in the room which we have before dieseribel--that in which the fairy vision of the " 1amnulet ring " came to Morgan-her gtitar in her lap, and her fingers carelessly running over its chords, imnprovising an accompaniment to her own thoughts. Upon thie entrancee of her father she rose, laid the instrument aside, and. as she over, did, welcomed his return with a kiss. "Bless thee, sweet child-blkes thee!" said the old man, as he pressed her form to his breast. "I have news for thee whichlh masy add light to thine eyes, and freshen the roses on thy cheek P" *' It must be good indeed to do flint, my father. My ears are open to receive it!" ("We are to have a visitor to-night-one who wears the golden spurs of lknighthood!" ' Whant ie that to me, my father? No stran- ger knight can have attraction enoulgh in my eyes to brighten them. What care I for sucl a visitor?" "' Stppose he be not utterly a stranger?" ' Whlat dost thou mean, my father? Thou hast not been in the habit of dealing in mys- tery with thy poor Coraline!" "Dostrthou remember Henry Mforgan, my young protege? Ah I now the roses, ay, the carnation on thy cheek, tell that thou dost. And did not those long lashes veil thine eves, I think I should see a brighter fire than usual there!"  '$ "i What of thy prlcge, my father?" asked the blushing girl. "I prithee cease thy ban- tering, and tell me." * I met him but an hour gone by on 1his way   to the castle. Two servants rode behind him. On his heels were the golden spurs of knight- hood-a plumed cap was on his head, and a diamond star upon his breast!" (' Didst thou not speak to him. my father?" "' No ; there were those near by whose no- tice I did not wish to attract; and a look was all that I gave him for a welcome. But he said he would be here at midnight, as he ,passed me; and then we will learn by what wonderful good fortune -he has so soon made advancement!" "Sooner, perhaps, my father. There is MaIlak!" Even as she said, Malak stood at the door, and now advanced, with a packet in his hand, which le reverently delivered to the old man. The latter glanced at the seal, and, saying: "It is from Lord Yaricliffe!" opened the let- ter, and perused its contents. A gleam of pleasure lay like sunshine on his face while he did so. "Sir Henry Morgan!-the name sounds well, does it not, my child?" said lie, as he closed the letter, and placed it within his doublet. --It does, my father. But how did he earn his title?" "With his sword, good child!-with his sword, in defence of virtue and age! Andl fighting in the presence of his king, he was was knighted by the monarch's own hand! Wert thou present, Malak?" "I was, master. As I was bidden, I have retmained ever close by the side of my new nmaster-neither b 'y    y day have I been been beyond his call!" "Does 11e not reward thy faith?" lie is very kind, my master. Neverbraver man wore a sword -never kinder issued a omnmand!". It is well. 'What doth he at the castle?" "He bore a letter from the king to the earl 1" t flow did the earl receive him?" "At first, in wonderment; and then wel- comed( hirm as if he had been the noblest lord in the realm!" "And the Lady Helen-how did she receive him?" asked Coraline. - "I know not, lady; for I was not admitted beyond the saloon. But this I know: my mas- ter passed her on the bridge, without a word or look to shew that he had'ever seen her!" "Ah! pride hath already grown up with his rank!" she murmured. '" ie loves her not- he loves her not!" "Lord Yarneliffe saith that he saved the few Salomon, one of my trusty friends, and his lovely daughter from rapine and wrong!" said the old man. "Was that so, Malak?" asked the lady. "It was, lady." "Was the Jewess vory beautiful?" "Almost as beautiful as my lady!" \   "Was she very grateful to your master for his service?" "I know not how grateful, my lady. Her heart alone could answer that question-thine best imagine it!" "Methinks my Coraline seems strangely curious I She had best reserve her questioni for the young knight, rather than his serv. ant!" said her father. "Dost thou think I would question him, oi that I care to know how many ladies he has served since he left here, my father? Why should I, who have never yet exchanged a word with him, feel so deep an interest as thy words would imply 9"  "Ask thy heart, my child-ask thy heart, rather than me. I shall not chide thee now for loving him, nor forbid thee to win him, if thou canst, for he has provtd himself a man; and much do I err, if lhe does not. yet rise far above nobles who now may leok down upon him. He has a bold, true heart, knows no fear, is well skilled in arms, and is as am- bitious as the eagle, which seeks to overtop the clouds." "Is these any message for my master? I must return to him," said Malak. "Tell him that we await him at the hour he named," replied Ethelbert. CHAPTER XVII. It was midnight. Sir Henry Morgan, who had early excused himself from the banquet given by the earl in his honor-excusing himself on the plea of fatigue-had left the castle unseen; and now, wrapped in a cloak that completely enveloped his figure, he paused near the entrance of the subterranean palace of his first friend and benefactor- paused to gaze once more on the wild beauty of the scene-paused to strengtrhen his deter. mination no longer to love Lady Helen, by a remembrance olf their last interview on that very spot. He had come alone, leaving Malak to answer any inquiries for him, by stating that he had retired, and did not wish to be disturbed. He lingered only a few moments outside, and then passed within the silvery sheet of the waterfall. He at once knew that his com- ing was expected, for the same sable guide who had at flrst met him there, stood, torch in hand, ready to escort him through the dark and narrow passes, to the gorgeous rooms within. Without speaking, the negro: passed on made the usual signs to gain entrance to tlh first apartment, where paced the armed sen. tinels, precisely as they had on Morgan's firse visit. At the threshold of the room, which the young knight so well remembered as the locale of his fairy vision, the negro paused,   but respectfully indicated with his land that the knight should proceed. Morgan did so, and in a moment found him- self in the presence of Ethelbert the Her- mit. But not clad as before, in a plain and humble garb, did he find the old man. None of all the nobles at the court of King Charles had he seen more richly dressed than was his friend the hermit, as he chose to be termed. His shape scarcely seemed to be deformed beneath the cloak cf crimson velvet embroid- ered with gold aid glittering with jewels, which he wore. He seemed more tall, for the plumed cap which lie wore upon his, well- formed head. In truth, were it not for his noble features, so well rernembered, Morgan would have believed that another iman stood before him. But oneo glance at his face, beaming with kindness, and yet full of dig- nity, was sufficient; and the young knight hastily advanced, and seizing his extended hand, pressed it to his lips. "Thou art most welcome, Sir!enry-most welcome back!" said the old man, heartily. "Call mie not, Sir Henry, rmy noble friend, but Master IIonry, as thou diaist when I was friendless," said the young knight. "Nay, honors won like thine must be worn, young friendI! My friend, Yarncliff, bath written all thy history since thy arrival in London, and I can1 congratulate thee nl thy advancellent, as well as lpraise thee that thou hast so nobly won tlhv spurs." "Thitnks, my bentfactor-had it not been for thee, I had yet been a worthless follow..r in Earl Caermiarthen's train." "Sighing for a glance from  his pyoud daughtt r's eye!" And the old man laughed, as he added those w-rds. 1"That folly is past," said the young knight, with a quiet, smile. " 1 ain proof against love now: 1ambition, and all the pride of my na- ture, have usurped its place, and love 'hath io longer room within my heart." Scarcely had the words passed the young man's lips, when, with a step so light that he heard it not-gliding like a shadow of Venus on a golden cloud-there appeared   before him the very counterpart of that beautiful being whom he saw in the vision, when the "amulet ring" was placed upon his finger. She did not speak ; but ther face was wreath- ed in smiles, her expression so full of loving tenderness, so utterly lovely, that he stood almost breathless for an instant, gazing with his soul in his eyes; then sinking on one knee, he apoke in a whisper, as if he feared that a louder tone would drive her away. '"If thou art a woman, speak--if an angel, leave me not, but hover ever near me, until Death comes to take me where thou dwellest!" The lady smiled-her smile, more eloquent   gt than words, naded fuel to the sudden flame j which burted within his bosom. He felt as if, indeed, -low he was within a circle of eno cliantment. But the spell was broken--. I broken by the merry laugh of Etlhelbert, o wh!, in a jibung tone, cried : , "I thought thy heart was nrrow-proof, Sir j lenry! But a moment agone thou wert boasting that only ambition nnd pride had a I place in thy bosom, and now thou art kneel- in ltg to my wild and silly daughter, Coraline! Ri, ie and take her hand--she is not an angel, r* by any mealns; her dis)osition runs rather to the opposite of one, :s thou lmal et iinZl on be- 3 coining nore acquainted with iler. " "Thy daughter, good Ethelbert?" "Ay,my daughter. m ln! Dost think be- cause I am misshapen, that my child must also be deformed?" "No, my noble friend ; but her beauty is superhuman!" "Pooh-pooh--thou art but a boy, and have not traveled yet. Slhe is fiair and duti- ful ; but take her hannd, and talk to her. Learn tlat she is but a woman--to lbe loved and cherished, but not to be zoorshipcd. Bend thy knee only to thly G(od!" So liddn, the young knlight could not but take the fair hand of the lady; and his heart thrilled willly, as lie felt lhis gentle pressure I't ,read, and( saw hle- dark eyes look kindly, but timnidly, in his own. "There-that is right--become acquainted. I have business that will occupy me for a half hour. Talk all the nonsense ye can for that timle, and then I will come, like a sage, to tall; sense with ye." And, laughingly, the old man went away. *"It seems to me as if we hald met before, fitir ldly!" said the young knigh;i, as he took ia seat near Coraline. ' I never saw Sir tenry Morgan until this hour!" said the lady. "And yet it seems to me that, in a vision, I have seen thee, lady! Hast thou ever seen this ring?" And li he extended toward her the hand upon which the amulet ring was placed. "I may not speak a falsehood, Sir Henry 1" she replied. "I have!" "Ah, lady I then what I deemed to be a vi. sion, was a reality. Yet thou didst say a moment agone that thou never hadst seen me before!" "Not so, Sir Knight! I said that, until this hour, I never had seen Sir Henry Mor- gan!  I knew Master Henry Morgan on the first visit which he made to my father's dwel ling, though myself unseen by him!" "And it was thy voice which I heard sing- ing?" "It was, Sir Henry!"   "And I fancied myself in an enchanted spot, listening to the voice of a fairy!" "Thou art superstitious, Sir Henry!"' ,( Nay, fair lady; pardon me that I contra- dict thee!" 4i Yet thou hast proved thyself 80o! Thou knelt to me but a few moments since, believ- ing that I was an angel-not a wonman!" i"Ah, lady! ,lattc not me, but the'won- drous beauty which led my Tenses astray!" "a Beauty, which a few holrs of illness can destroy--beauty, upon which the earth-worm will fatten-beauty, which is perishable as the flowers of the spring-beauty, which never had value to me until-" She paused, blushed, her lip trembled, and she stopped speaking. "' Until when, lady-until when F" asked the young knight, while his heart almost ceased to beat, in its struggle between hope apd fear. "Until I met one who seemed to think it worthy of his admiration!" she said, in a low, soft whisper, and her eyes were cast down as she spoke. "Admiration! O lady, that is too cold a word! Thy beauty is worthy of my wor- ship!" said he, and again he bent his knee before her, and raised her hand to -his lips. ' Come-come I This is nonsense indeed!" cried the father, entering at this moment. WlWhy, Sir Henry, thy pride 1yas gone a star- gazing, has it not Daughter, art thou teach- ing our guest his prayers?" "Dear fatheri thou art strangely fond of jesting, to-night!" said the blushing girl, while the young knight, more than half-angry at the untimely interruption, arose, confused and mortified, and resumed his seat. "Jesting, child? I am gay; but I jest not. I am astonished to see thy power   Our knight hath so quickly changed the current of his thought, and doffed the armor of his heart! Nav, be not angry with me, an old man, Sir llenry!" ' "I am not angry, my noble friend!" said the young knight. ( I own that new feelings have taken possession of my breast, as if by storm, and that I can no longer defy the power of love. I once thought that I loved the Lady Helen of Caermarthen. Now, I know that I did not! I felt a boy's passion; but I knew not then what love was!" s "Well, perchance thou knowest not yet what it is no more than my silly Coraline ; yet Nature is the only teacher. But to change the theme. I said that I would speak sense, after ye had passed a half-hour talking nonsense I I will begin. Thou hast a future!" "Ay, good sir! And so have all m6n t" "True; but all men have not a future which may by their own acts be made bril. liant. The future of some, struggle sw they   may, is dark and hopeless. It is of thy fu- ture that I would discourse!" "Ah, sir I if this fair star of thine but shine upon it-" A"Poh! Sir Henry, I am talking sense now. Lord Yarhcliff asks my advice regarding tlhe service in which thou canst best serve the king and thyself as well!" "He is kin I and thoughtful-a truly noble friend!" said Morgan, gratefully. "' He asks me," continued the old man,-" be- cause I have seen much service abroad, and served Charles I. so faithfully, that Charles II. should love me. But he does not; and if he knew where tfelay his hand upon me, would give the headsman a job!" "He cannot know thy ,noble heart-thy princely nature!" "Kings do not study heart! They study interest-little else. But I shall not now tell thee my history. The king will not trouble Ethelbert the .lermit; and I am only he at present. But, touching the service you seek, Yarncliffe tells me that the joyal treasure is almost drained--that the king is driven to borrow money of his nolbles, antdseven of the Israelites! A king without money is weaker tlhlln a .warrior without arms. If thou, then, sh. uldst, by daring service, be able to fill up that empty treasure-chest, thou wouldst so bind the king to thee that no boon within his gift would be refused!" "But how can I fill up his treasure-chest, good Ethelbert "           I "Thou hast wondeid at the wealth which I possess here! It is but a tithe of what thlu canst gain within a few short months, if thou dost seek it as I did--from the rapacious and Indian-robbing Spaniards in the Southern seas! They have amassed millions Upon imil- lions of pounds of silver and gold-- their churches and their houses are filled with im- ages made of precious metals, and studded with jewels. Not a ship leaves those south- ern ports but she bears homeward wealth enough to dower a princess. From those cowardly, treacherous, haughty Spaniards, I wrested the wealth which enabled King Charles I. for a time to stem the tide of enmity. When he fell, I made harvest for myself; ald for that his successor outlawed me!' "Ah I thou art Sir William-" "Hush I Speak not -the name until the king himself shall speak it with favor, and call me to his court 'in honor. My own child knows it not!" said the old man, hastily. "Call me Ethelbert-know me by no other name!" "Pardon me, most noble friend; but the fame of thy deeds have long sine resacled my ear; and right glad will I be, if the king wilt permit it, to follow in the path thou once did   trend, and to teach the haughty Done the weight of English steel. But wil! the king permit such enterprise in his name?" "1 lias necessity will jiot only cause him to permit, but to encourage it. Make thou the offer through Lord Yarncliff, and see how quickly he will take the bait. If he will comr mission thee, tell him that thou wilt fit out thine own vessel!" "But I have not the means!" "Take no heed for that. Get thou the com- mission, and I will place as swift a keel be- neath thy feet as ever clove the azure waters of the sea. I will give thee pilots, too, who know every port, and isle, and reef among those seas: and charts of mine own, which will make those seas uas familiar to thee as are the 1paths about Caerumarthen's castle!" "' Noble Ethelbert, how can I ever repay thee I?" "When thou hast made the king so regard thee that he will refuse thee nothing which thou mayst ask, I will claim my reward. Un- til then I do not even ask thy thanks; for I tell thee I am selfish-like all men, I am sel- fish, and, in the good I do for thee, look to the 5ood I shall yet do myself through thee?"  During this conversation, Coraline had srai silent, but not disinterested. When her fath- or paused, she said. ^ The service which thou dost commend urtAo Sir ILenry is full of peril, my father!" "Ay; therefore the more meritorious!" "He may lose his life, my fatherl" He may lose it there, or here, or anywhere; but nowhere will he lose it until God's good will takes it from him; and no peril is peril- amo to the brave man who feels that his life is in his Maker's hands. I have fakced all the- perils that he may be called to face, and yet I live! Never let Cord of thine turn one whom thou deemest wSrthy of a thought fromn tie line of duty or the path of honor!" "Pardon, my father. When thou speakest of peril, I feel that I am but a woman, with a h woman's fears and weaknesses!" "True, dear child; but our guest hath fasted too long within our halls. Bid Mirza bring wine and food, and then cheer us up with some gay song." "I will, dear father." Anul the lovely girl hastened to attend to the wishes of her parent. CHAPTER    XVIII. Only a week had passed by since Lord Per- 1 cival, publicly disgraced, had been banished , from  the realm by the king's proclamation, forbidden to return, on pain of death and for- I feiture of all right of estate Or succession, un- ti Ihis majesty might relent and give him per- I mission so to dp. Only one week; and during - 9that time Mr.: Brompton-now quite a man of 1   mark, as the agent 'of the banished noble-- had sold his noble patron's stud of horses, the furniture of his house, and had converted into cash all of his available property, with the avowed iltention of following his banished friend into exile. And, at the expiration of that week, he left London; and those who knew him .supposed,. of course, that he had gone, in all the honesty and faith of a true man, to share the sorrows of him who in brighter days had been his friend. On the day after his disappearance from London, " a couple of horsemen might have ben seen riding "--I Iquote from Jhmes' last novel, dear reader-"a couple -of horsemen might have been seen riding along \the great high road which led from London through the ancient town of Harrow, tending westward I y the way of Cheltenham toward Wales. On i, by his looks, seem. d to be a farmer, in eas y cireumstances; for his corpulent form wais well clad. and he rode a powerful gelding; , whose " points " of blood were excellent. Hia portmanteau seemed well filled, as if he ill- tended taki  ng a l1ng journey. But, unlilbe most of his class, this person had made no use ofthe razor, and wore a beard which a Jew might well have envied-a beard which comi- pletely covered the lower part of his face,. But, though his dress and mounting indicated him to belong to the class which I hai ed named, there was a something in the quick flashing of his dark eye, and in his manner, which an experienced observer would lhave no- ticed, and which indicated him to be of a different rank from that which his dress woul!d show. In short, hel was evide1C'I ly sailing un- der false colors. Equally well mounted, but (rcssead even more plainly-like the servant of a farmt r 4" well to do in the world," was he who rode beside the first mentioned. His face was close shaven, and his hair cut close enough to have pleased the strictest i"Round Head " of the strictest Cromwellian day. But if we would learn who they were, anwl upon what mission ben, we must play the spy and listen to their talk; for as they rode on in the cool, bracing air of the early morning, their tongues kept time with the feet of their steeds. The day had but just dawned, and by the looks of their horses, they had evidently al- ready ridden some miles at a rapid rate. "Well Brompton," said the farmer-like man, " how do I look in the light of day- thinkest thou that there is any danger of re cognition'." "None whatever, my lord-the mother who bore thee would not know thee now. Thy padded figure, and boarded face so alter thee, that had I not aided ln the transformation, I never would feel that Lord Percival was now bcside me."   "Farmer Bagstock, man--farmer Bagstock! Drop the lord now, and have a guard on thy tongue lest it betray me. I shall no longer call thee Brompton, but simply by thy first name, George. Thy shaven face and close- out locks so disfigure thee, that the devil wouldn't know thee!" "Where will we stop to rest and freshen our horses, farms r?" asked Brompton. "Here in this town of Harrow, which we are approachingr. I remember an inn which I have passed, the sign of the "Bullock and golden Sheaf"-doubtless there we will find accommodation suitable to our apparent con- dition of life 1" "I shall be right glad to find it, my lord, for I am so unused to riding, that five hours in the saddle weary me excedingly!" '"If thou makest complaint now, honest George, ere our journey is fairly commenced, I fear thou wilt make but a weak companion ere we reach Wales." "Fear not, my lord-farmer Bagstock, I mean It Fear not, I shall harden as I go on! I mind me well when I went to school, at Eton, tVhe usher's rod smarted terribly at first; but in a little time, the place of application became so callous, that I minded his blows no more than I should had they been inflicted with a wheaten straw, 'stead of a birchen wand!" "Well, whip up-whip up; I. see the sign of the inn I spoke of, looming up in yonder ' street like a beacon before a weary mariner. Now be on thy guard, and speak to me only as farmer Bagstock, using such language as the employed use to their employers! And speak as little as possible, lest thy tongue make a slip." "Fear not for me, farmer-but let ile cau- tion thee against one thing. Do not give the hostler a crown as thou wouldst do in thy prop- er position. If thou went to give him more than a shilling, we would be taken for high- waymen, if nothing else!" "I will be cautious; but that last idea of thine is capital. If our purses run low--so well armed and mounted as we are-we can replenish them i" "Surely, my lord--farmer Bagetock, I mean, thou wouldst not--" "Necessity will do many things, honest George. But we are in no danger of being driven to the road for a living at present  Thou hast a thousand pounds of mine sewed within thy doublet, and I have yet a full purse of gold, and wherewithal to obtain .more. Ride up, let us arrive at the inn in proper shape-not as if we had ridden two-thirds of the night."    ' . Honest George quickened the pace of his horse, and in a few momenta the travelers   drew rein before the inn, and called for food for themselves and their beasth. CHAPTER XTX.    ? So agreeably did the hours pass in S]he pre- ence of Ethelbert and his lovely daughter, that Sir Henry Morgan could scarcely tear himself from their company, although he knew that it was necessary, in order to pre- serve'tlhe secret of his friend and benefactor from prying eyes, that he should be at the cas- tle before his absence should be discovered. Indeed, day was dawning when he entered the castle-gat ; and observing that some of its inmates were already astir, he entered the flower-garden, as if he had just risen to take a walk in the freshness of the morning air. He wandered through its meandering paths to a point whence, looking over the rocky parapet, he could gaze down into the foaming Towy, and looking beyond over the broken outline of wooded hills, note the crimsoning sky in the East, which betokened -the up-coming of the sun. Seated here, he let his imind wander back in a delicious reverie to the scene which he had so much enjoyed an hour or two be- fore. Closing his eyes, he fancied that Cora- line, in her almost supernatural beauty, stood before him--he tried to fancy that, in the soft. whispering of the breeze, he heard her voice -that he felt her breath upon his cheek. A rustling sound, as of silken robes and a light step, aroused him from his dreamy rev- erie, and he opened his eyes almost with the thought that the object of his dream was be- fore him. A lady was there-but it was not Coraline. It was the earl's daughter. "My father's guest must have rested poor- ly, to be up before the sun," said the lady, whose pale cheek and wNary eyes told that she had rested poorly, or not at all. "Not so, fair lady!" he replied. "It is a habit of mine to rise early and breathe the strong, fresh air of morning. Is it also a cus, tom of- thine?" "Not a custom, Sir Henry-not a custom I But I courted sleep in vain last night; and feeling ill, thought that the dewy air might revive me. . I rose and came hither, as I often, do, to look down into those beautiful, but treacherous waters, which had been my grave but for. thee I Sometimes I grieve that I did. not perish then." a "Ah, lady, such regret, it seems to me, ia reproach to those who love thee t" Is Those who lome e? Who, thinkest thou, is there that feels love for Helen of Caermar- then?" "Thy father, fair lady, thy kindred, and,' those who are so happy as to be in thy, *erv, ice."   The Iadv had asked her question with fever- ish earnestness, and seemed to have anticipat- ed a different reply; for when he spoke so coidly and calmly of the love of all but him- self, shd sunk down upon a seat as if she were fainting, and a sigh came up from her bosom so deep and painful in its tone, that the young knight reproached himself for not speaking more kindly. She remained silent some time, and when he looked at her face, he saw that tears were slowly rolling from her lash-veiled eyes down over her pale cheeks. And feeling pity for her, he said: "I hope that naught which I have said hath grieved thee, sweet lady!" A sob was the only answer to his words. Then came a gush of tears; and weeping bit- terly, she burted her face in her hands, as if to try to hide the grief which she could not restrain. "Sweet lady, for Heaven's sake do not grieve so! IfI have offended thee, I pray thee pardon me, for I have done it ui:witting- y!" "Offended me," she sobbed-" offended me? Ah I another coufdst not offend one who would die for thee I Henry Morgan, my pride is conquered-my heart is breaking for thee! Thou once did kneel to me and spoke of love, and though I loved thee then, I only spoke of friendship. Oh, if thou dost not love me now -if I, by my then coldness, have driven love from thy heart, I am punished, fearfully pun- ished, for my heart-my very soul is thine." Startled at this wildly-passibnate avowal, sobbed out amid her tears, the young knight knew not what to say or do. The time had been when those words would have been more precious to him than all the wealth of Gol- oonda's mines. Now, they filled his heart with sorrow, for he no longer felt that she was dear to him. He loved another, and his love for that other was all the more fervent be- cause the flame was freshy lighted. The lady, after she spoke, ceased to sob- seemed to still her very heart's throbbings down, and almost breathlessly waited for his reply. She waited in vain; for he, not know- ing what to say, remained silent, cold, pale, and still as a statue. "Lot-oi--los-8t!" she muimdred, and sunk senseless to the earth.  Terrified and fearful for her lif, he raised her-from the ground, and by kind words, strove to revive her. He even kissed her pale, cold brow, and called her endearing names, for he feared that she would die, and that her death would lie upon his heart. He upbraided himself as ocrel and faithless, and strove to call back the love which had fled from his heart, if, in truth, it ever had been nestled there. But all in vain. Love once \      '    startled from its nest, like a bird affrighted by the hunter, never will return again. It may look back, but never will it seek its former rest- ing-place. But the kind words and caresses of the young knight seemed to bring back life to the lady, for she opened her eyes, and trembling in every nerve, lay for a brief moment in his arms, till her strength came back so that she could rise. Then gently she released herself from his embrace, and said: "Thon artvery kind, Sir Henry. Pray. for- get my weakness. I will seek my chamber, and strive to be myself again." And she rose to walk toward the castle. But she would have fallen with weakness, had he not supported her with his strong arm; and she was forced to lean upon him, else she could not hive reached her apartments: With a kind, sad smile she dismissed him at the door of her chamber, saying that she would meet him with her father at breakfast, and hoped that the memory of all that had occurred that morning might pass from his mind. Alas, poor girl I could it and hopeless love ass from thine, thy heart would not be so heavy.  CHAPTER XX. It was a week later. The noble Earl of Caermarthen had issued a general invitation to every noble within visiting distance, and to all of the tenants of his vast estates, to at- tend a fete to be given on that day in honor of the young knight, Sir Henry Morgan. And they came pouring in by hundreds-ay, by thousands-and ere the hour of noon, the spa- cious court of the castle was filled with the hardy yeomanry of the land, and the great halls and saloons of the castle crowded with those of higher rank. Puncheons of beer stood open in the court, free of access to all who were thirsty-wines and liquors were at hand in the refreshment- rooms of the castle; and the cooks were busy in the great kitchen, preparing for a lordly banquet within, while outside, an ox was roasting whole, and sundry sheep and haunches of venison were undergoing a like process near by. It were needless for us to point out or particularize the nobles present, or the fair ladies who smiled so sweetly as they were in- troduced to the young hero-ladies who would not have cast a second glance at him while he was hbt an unknown follower in Earl Cedric's trait#. Lady Helen, inost beautiful of all, was present, now herself again," as cold and haughty as if she never had wept in the aban- donment of a hopeless love. But one was not there who would have outshone the Lady Helen, as she outshone the rest. Cor- nline never had entered the astle-gates,   nor had she any desire to do so. Wie knew that the young knight's heart was all her own, and cared little how many fair ones tried to win him. The young knight was kindly attentive to Lady Helen-not so much so that his actions could be construed into love, but so far as the courtesy due a lady and a friend demanded. We now will look among the crowd. There were a few who were strangers to the tenantry -some who had taken advantage of the gen- oral invitation to gratify their curiosity-oth- ers who wished to enjoy the feast, and yettwo others whose motives in attending there can best be understood by the reader, when I say that they were the persons who styled them- selves Farmer Bagstock and Honest George. Mingling with people of their own apparent class, partaking of the beer, and apparently minding their own business, they attracted no attention from the general crowd. But a crooked-backed Jew peddler, who had a beard as heavy as that of the farmer, but which was white as snow, and whose eyes glittered with serpent-like fire through a pair of green spec- tacles, very persistently kept near them-en- deavoring to get them to purchase some of his jewelry, or other notions, of which he had quite a stock in a huge box which he carried before him, suspended by a strap which passed over his shoulders. The pretended farmer, to get rid of his imlportunities, purchased several little trifles; and, in paying for them, exhibited a purse full of gold-an imprudence which he re- gretted a moment after; for the Jew seemed to cling all the'closer to him after that. He did not think, however, that those keen eyes had seen the coronet and crest which were worked upon the silken bag. Yet they had. "Go away, my Hebrew friend I have made all the purchase I shall of thee 1" he said, at last tired of the continued importunities of the Jew. "Nay, I possess one thing which I think thou wilt afford to buy!" said the Jew. "Thou hast nothing more that I want. Leave me, and pester some one else!" said the farmer, angrily. "Shall I go and offer thy secret to some one else, my lord?" whispered the Jew. The farmer started, as if an adder had stung him. "What dost thou mean " he asked. But his tone was as low and cautious as that of the Jew. ,  "That I know Lord Percival, in spite of his disguise, as well as confederate I Andemore, I know thy pfrpose in coming here!" "Silence, Jew!--ilence I and a purse of gold shall reward thee I Keep thou the se- cret which thou hast learned -I know not how-and meet me as soon as thou wilt in the in,   wood below the castle, and I will give thee the gold " "And cut my throat afterward, to recover it again!" said the Jew, mockingly. "On my honor, I will do thee no harm!" "On thy honor!"And the Jew laughed a' low, sardonic laugh. "Art thou what thou seemest?" asked the disguised lord, whose suspicions were aroused. "Ay, my lord. I am only a poor Jew-a cousin of the Jew Solomon, whom thou wouldst have robbed, had not the hero of this day's fete proved himself thy master I Thou seest that I know thee!" "Ay-ten thousand curses light upon thee I -I see thou dost." "Curse me not-anger me not, or I will proclaim thee here; where, if thou art seized, thy journey back to London, and to the heads- man's block, will cost thee nothing!" The disguised lord trembled, not only at the words, but at the vindictive glance which accompanied them. He knew that not only his liberty, but his life was in the power of the Israelite. His only chance of safety was, either to fly from the place or purchase the silence of the Jew. While he was thinking whether it were not best to do the former, his persecutor said:       . ' "That plan will not do, my lord!" "What plan?" asked Percival., "That of which thou wert then thinking. Wert thou to fly from here, I would follow thee, and make thee buy my secret!" & "Art thou a devil, Jew?  "I am near one, my lord!" said the Jew. And again his low, mocking laugh reached the ear of the trembling villain. "What wilt thou take to swear by the God of Abraham, that thou wilt not betray me?" "Meet me at midnight, at the fall where the Towy leaps from the -lake in which it heads, and f will tell thee. Thou needst not attempt to evade me, for I love thee not, proud lord! The wrongs which thou wouldst have done to my kindred are not forgotten!" "Jew, I will be there, with gold to buy thy silence! Betray me not, and thou shalt be richer than thou dreamest of " "It is well." With these words, the Jew disappeared; and Percival sought a more retired spot, where he could confer with his confederate in crime, and plan some means to secure the silence of the 'Jew forever; for he did not like to part with gold when it was becoming so scarce a commodity with him. CHAPTER XXI. Once more, reader, to the foot of the Towy waterfall-the mysterious veil to the home of Ethelbert the ilermit. The midnight hour had not come, when the two persons, assum,.   ing to be Farmer Bagstock and his man, Honest George, arrived there ; for fear adds wings to weak humanity, as well as love. They had passed the day, bright though it had been, in a terror which made it darker than the storm which was now fast rising, and casting a deeper darkness than the usual night-gloom over the earth. The mysterious Jew had more than once been seen by them; and they knew that their every step was watched, and that their lives were at his mercy. Therefore had they hastened thus early 'to the uppointed place of meeting,] hoping that he, hurried by avarice, would also be as prompt, and they the sooner be freed from the terror whic+i held them in chains. But when they came, there was no sign of anything human near. There was the water- fall, looking white in the blackness of the night-the huge old rocks and trees, a thou- sand shadows and shapes to fancy superhu- manitics out of-nothing like life. I said a storm was rising. They had been lighted on their thitherward path by the moon and stars; but, even while they came, now and then a flying cloud would darken the light above, and so shadow their way, that they had to check their haste. But when they reached the appointed spot, as if it would check all return, a storm blackened with its cloudy pall the entire sky-spread that pall in silence, without the sound of,the tempest-breath, without the muttering of thun- d-r! In utter silence lay that storm upon tile sky. Reader, whether you be so unfortu- nate as to be a house-dweller in a great city, or so fortunate as I, to live amid the lonely grandeur of the far-away forest-whet her you bo one of those whose tread is on the mighty deep, or one whose walk is on the land-you have seen the phenomenon I describe. A storm black to almost utter darkness in the houtrs of day, which held in its wrath until you almost prayed it would speak, to tell whether thunder, lightning, wind, or hail, or harmless rain would be its out-pouring. Such was this coming storm; and when a ragged chain of pale, red lightning ran over tile ebon concave, it threw a pallid glare on two faces there below-faces which expressed a fear which it were hard to describe. "It seems as if the foul fiend himself were abroad, George. The air smells of sulphur- there is something fearful in this!" said Per- cival, alias Bagstock. "Yes-y-e-s, my lord. I wish we ne'er had followed this path. It must be near the mid- night hour-where can the accursed Hebrew be loitering?" replied his companion, Bromp- ton. "The deuce knows - perhaps the. storm- signs have terrified him!"   "WhLat, my lord!-a tempest bar a Jew from gold within his reach? Nor fire, nor water, heat nor cold, can deter him when upon the scent of gold. He will be here!" "I hope so. Once hetre, he will ne'er de- part. The night is best fitted for the work before us! No prying eyes will pierce a veil so black as this night affords!" "He may not come alone, my lord!" "What! thinkest thou a Jew would share with another that whichl may be all his own? Thou knowest not the race, good George. He will be alpne! Have thy weapons ready, ilen as I have mine! When I extend tlhe purse, extend thou that g4od rapier of thine, and let its point make acquaintance with his heaft! Good Lord, deliver us! Has the ar- tillery of all heaven opened?" The last exclamation of the speaker was caused by a blinding flash, or rather a suc- cession of flashes of lightning, which seemed to run over the sky in every direction, makin; the scene all around as bright, for a second, as if the world were on fire. The next in- stant, all was utter darkness; but rolling-no, crushing is the term-crushing upon their ears, came a peal of thunder which fairly shook those heavy cliffs-made the firm rocks beneath them tremble. It passed-all was still and dark as before. "Let us go from here, my lord; I dare not stay I My heart shakes with a vague terror, which, I own, unmans me!" "I dare not go-I would not stay! The Jew has our secret. If we break the tryst. we cannot fly the kingdom ere the hounds of the realm will be on our track. I wish I knew the hour!" "It is midnight, and I am here!" said a voice, which heard by them but for a moment, was too quickly recognized. "Ah! 'tis thee, good Hebrew!" said Perci- val, in his smoothest tone. "'Tis a poor night for our meeting; but dark though it is, if thou. wilt give me thy hand, I will place the purse of gold within it, and then ;retive the assur- ance that thou wilt keep th,. secret thou hast gained. Here is the gold. Dost hear it jin- gle VI "Ay, my lord! I hear the jingle of gold, and also tjiat of steel. Thou wouldst not give a poor Jew a purse of gold, and then slay him to get it back again-thus insuring his silence at no cost to thyself? Surely, noble peer of England, thou wouldst not do that?" Tihe voice of the titled villain trembled as he ;rlied: "Nay, good Jew, we mean thee fair. We only ask thee to swear' by the God of thy fathers not to betray us. Thy hand, thy hand -here is the gold! Curse this darkness that we cannot see each other "   "( Rather bless it that it hides the pallor on thy cheek, brave Percival!" "Cease mocking me, Jew; take the oath that I desire, and this purse, with all the gold thou wouldst have, and let us begone." "Whither would ye go, my lord?" "What is that to thee, when our comnpact is fulfilled?" "Not much, good lord, to me, but to a friend of mine it may import more. But why is Honest George so silent?" "'I do my own business," replied Percival haughtily. "Mr, Brompton is only my friend, and not compromised with me." "How is that, Honest George Brompton?" asked the Jew, mockingly. No answer came. "George-George!" cried the peer, now thoroughly terrified. "George, where are There was no answer to this appeal. "The saints protect me; the coward has fled and left me all alone. But, Jew, do thy worst, I can deal with thee alone. Where art thou, thou murdering villain?-- where art thou?" There was no answer now, from any lip; but again came a binding lihih of light, and though it lasted but for an instant, the terror- st ricken loiod saw that he was surrounded by a band of men as black as the night itself; and, fancying that the very fiends of hell had risen to seize hinm he sunk with a wild shriek to the ground, while again the earth shook with the peals of thunder, which now came heavy and fast-for the storm had broken its bonds, and was pouring all its fury forth. CHAPTER XXII. How long Lord Percival lay insensible, he knew not; but when he recovered his senses, although he was in utter darkness, he became aware that lihe had been removed from the vicinity' of the waterfall, and was beneath some shelter-for he did not hear the noise of the cataract, nor feel the chill of the night-air. lie felt that he was lying upon a rude cot, such as were used by seamen; and most won- dered why: those who had been kind enough to bring llim there, should leave him to re- cover without aid. As he was on the point of callirg out to try and bring some person to his presence, a low moan reached his ears, and he knew that he was not alone in the apartment, or place, whatever it might be. "Who is there?" he asked, his own voice so feeble that it startled him. "Heavens! my lord, art thou here?" an- swerd Brompton. "Yes, George!" replied Percival instantly recognizing the voice of his pander. But   where is here-how came we here? Reply, for mercy 's sake; or is this all a dream?" , "I wish it were, my lord. Whilst the Jew was talking with thee, I was seized from be- hind, gagged before I could speak, and dragg- ed by no gentle means' to this spot, wherever it is. I am here on cold rock, bound so that I Van neither stir my hands nor feet; but they rerkoved my gag. I heard a stifled sound like footsteps a little while ago, but then no more. You must have been brought here when I was." 4"I know not how I came, George. 1 believe I was struck down by a flash of lightning! I fancied I saw a group of grinning imps of hell all around me-but that must have been fancy." "I know not, my lord! The devil must have been present at my handling. I know I smelt sulphur! I heard no word spoken after the Jew asked me a question to which 1 could not reply, seeing that a gag was in my mouth. There must be something beyond human in this! But if thou art free, canst thou not unbind me, so that we may strive to find out where we aie, and what this means?" "I will try, George! My arms are gone, Are thine, also, taken from thee?" "They are, my lord." "Then we are prisoners I I was a fool to return from France." "And I to advise thee to it, my lord. Would we were there now! But, pray, try to release me, for these cords cut like steel into my flesh. Saint George protect me H-what is that?" The last exclamation, uttered so loudly, instantly caused Percival to ask its me4ning. "We are in some place of enchantment, my lord!" replied Brompton. "I had barely uttered the wordsa- that ' the cords cut like steel into my flesh,' than without a sound they were unloosened, and I am free!"  "Free from them, but from what else? Let us see if we can feel Walls; ah I I do-a wall of massive stone, without a chink I will follow it around and find a door." "And I will cry out, and see if some one -will not come to help us. This is madden- ing."  And one shouted, w lile the other groped around the walls of the room, until he found himself again by the cot from which he had risen; finding no door, no sign which seemed to indicate that there was one. Percival, now utterly hopeless, sunk down upon the cot, and Brompton guided by the sound of his voice, crept to his side. "What shall we do, my lord?" he asked, his tone indicative of complete helplessness and misery. "Wait for our fates and die like men. We are caged, and must perish. I feel in my heart that it is sO. Oh that we had remained /   where we could have died with our weapons in our hands!" "Thinkest thou, my lord, that this is done by order of the king?" "Ay I who else would have the power I His spies have tracked us hither; we have been decoyed to some spot where a peer of the realm, and the last scion of a noble race, can be dispatched so privately, that the manner, time, or place of his death, will remain un- known to all who are interested in the honor of his rank or name." "Why should they murder me with thee?" groaned Brompton. "' That thy tongue shall never tellhow thy friend perished!" "Ohl! curse the hour that ever I became thy friend." "Thou my friend, George Brompton? last thou not lived upon my bounty for years? Hast not thy friendship, and have not thy services, all been bought with my gold. And now thou fearest to die with me. In sooth, I shame to die with such a base coward as thou art 1" "I am n? more a coward than thou, Lord Percival; but I would rather die for some fault less heiAous than that of being faithful to thee in thy disgrace and misfortune." This colloquy was brought to a sudden ter- mination by a jarring sound, as of some heavy substance being moved near them. "What is that?-who is there?" cried both, in a breath. There was no reply, but a lieht suddenly appeared, lowered from above, and though it for a moment almost' blinded them with its brilliancy, they soon could so use their eyes as to look about them. They were in a room some thirty or forty feet in circumference, which was walled with solid stone. No door could be seen. Above them all was darkness -no roof appeared in sight. The lamp which hung above their reach was suspended by a chain. But what most astonished them was, that a table, furnished with food and wine, stood in the centre of the room. We are not to die by starvation!" said Brompton, forgetting, for'the instant, the bit- ter words he had just spoken. Percival made no reply, but again took the circuit of the walls, looking for some knob, or crevice, or tolen of a secret door; for he felt sure that there must be one to the apartment. He found no sign. ' This is a cave!" he said, at last. "* We must have been lowered from above, as is that lamp. Yet, no--that table has been brought in, not lowered. Perhaps my doom is to be imprisonment here instt ad of death!" "Either fate is terrible to think of-but, my lord, I will bear it with thee. Forgive my hasty words-I am equal to my fate, now!"   Before Honest George said this-we may as well privately inform the reader -he had swallowed two brimming goblets of wine, do- ing so while the peer was examining the walls of the room. "I not only forgive thee, George, but I ask thy pardon for doubting thy faith. I will drink with thee, as we oft have done before, and whatever chances to the one will be shar- ed by the other. This is good wine-it goes through my veins like a fresh tide of life. George, there is hope yet left-we will not de- spair." "And this food-why, where'er we nmay be, my lord, they lack not for dainties. Here is venison, and by my life a salmon fresh and yet warm! A kitchen is near. They will not let us starve." And thus those two men, who were such cowards in the dark, with light to fee (ach other by, and food and wine before tilerl, ate and drank until they became quite brave-- drank until they became so friendly that they embraced each other, aid then sunk down in a drunken slumber on the same cot, side by side. CIIAPTER XXIII. Sir Henry Morgan, although he appeared to enjoy thleftte and banquet given in his honor by the noble earl-although he moved alike amid his old friends and equals, and tlhse who now sought to do him honor in the higher cir- cle of their rank, with such grace and cour- tesy as to win praise from every lip, felt that (very moment had a leaden weight upon its wings. His heart was not there. He had been privately notified by the mysterious Jew, whhose disguise lie penetrated at a glance, that his presence was required as soon after midnight as he could leave the castle unno- ticed. Pleading fatigue, he left the gay company before the hour named, and retired to his own apartments, there to concert with his ever- faithful Malak means for leaving the castle unseen. The rising storm-the signs of which ere already visible-would, he well knew, id him in his purpose, and he impatiently awaited its coming, that lie might hasten un- der its cover to the side of her who had suffi- cient strength, even for the time, to check his dreams of ambition. The storm came on-came on so fiercely, that it drowned the sounds of revelry within; so fiercely that those who loitered about the gates, or within the court, fled to such shelter as was nearest, and there was no fear that he who would pass forth then would meet an- other in the path'. At that hour, alone, needing no guide, arm- ed, and wrapped in his heavy cloak, Henry organ stepped quietly from the outer door 4   of his chamber which faced toward the court, and in a, moment he was breasting the storm along the pathway which led to the waterfall. Guided by the sound of the rushing waters, and his recollection of every rise and fall, and every turn in the track, he hastened on, and in little more time than he would iave used by daylight, reached his point of destination. Coraline was there, ready to receive him with her brightest smiles, but her father was absent. The young knight inquired where he was.       I "Attending to two particular friends .of thine, Sir Henry," she replied. "Two friends who did thee the honor to attend the fete to- day like himself in masquerade." "' Friends of mine, dear lady? Surely, I should have known them, quickly, as I did thy father, had they been friends!" "I did but jest, dear knight of mine I They were not friends; but let me beseech thee for my sake, if not for thine own, to be as watch- ful in thy out-looking for foes as for friends! A banished noble attended the fete to-day dis- guised as a commoner."  "What, Percival?" "The same, sir knight." "Where is lie now?" "In safe custody, and soon will be in a con- dition for inspection, my young friend," said the father of Coraline, who, entering in time to hear Morgan's last question, replied to it: "What dost thou suppose was the objeet of his visit to these parts?' asked Morgan. "'Revenge, without a doubt! Thou hast thwarted him in his passion and his avaricious aims. Thou hast been the cause of his dis- grace! -Thinkeat thou that he would not seek revenge--he who has little else to live for?" "Why does he not ask iWtf the sword's point, then?" "He knows thy sword too well. The dag- ger, or poison, woull suit his humor better. But he and his tool, George Brompton, are in thy power now; and if thou dost follow my counsel while they remain abroad, as the king desires, they will learn a lesson of humility all too well deserved. But come with me to look upon them, and I will explain my wishes as we go. Excuse our presence, daughter, for a brief time; and when we return, ave re- freshments ready for us, for Sir Henry must soon again breast the storm on his return to the castle." CHAPTER XXIV. It was noon on the day subsequent to the grand fete at the castle; and the earl, languid from the effects of the previous night's ex- cesses, had just made his appearance-as was his daily custom when at home-in his hall of i reception to attend to any business which i   his stewards or agents might prefer; or to hear any petitions or complaints from 8tis tenantry. Here he was met by his young guest, whom he saluted with his accustomed courtesy. '"Th' n, like myself, seemest to have lain late abed this morning, Sir Henry-that is, if this is thy first appearance. And thy cheek is pale-our revels do not agree with thee." "Thou speakest truly, noble earl-my cheek would be ruddier for an hour in the forest, while the dew gems grass and flowers, than it is after a day and night of gayety. But I shall soon be where fresh air and the exercise necessary for one who aspires to be a soldier will drive all pallor from my cheek-all lan- guor from my frame." "Where thinkest thou the king will send thee, my young knight?" "To combat with the haughty Spaniards in their strongholds in the Southern seas, I opine. My Lord Yarneliff will seek that service for me-I am a volunteer for the 'venture." "'Tis a brave one-but full of peril. The Spaniards fight well-have strong forts, good Q ships, and are never weak-handed in point of numbers." "Granted, noble earl-therefore the more merit in him who chastises their pride, weak- ens their strength, and enriches his patrons and himself by the spoils which they, as rob- bers, have taken from the Incas and princes of the lands they claim to hold." " Thou wilt need help to fit thee out, Sir Henry," said the earl, graciously, beginning to see that it might be advantageous for hin to be a patron. "None, noble earl--none! Is not the king my friend?" replied Morgan, rather coldly. "Ay-he is the patron; but to my knowl- edge, his treasure-chest is well-nigh empty. We, his loyal nobles, have been called on more than once to aid him in-sustaining the appear- ance of his court, so that no foreign power may think him poor. This, to thee, in all confidence. The fitting-out which he will give to thee-whether it be in ships, or arms, or munitions of war-will be poor, I fear. Thou hadst better accept the aid I proffer, and I will be content with but a small portion of thy gain, for I feel that thy successes will be great." "If I have need of aid, gracious earl, I will inform thee. As it is, I have not; and shal strive to make my way without more." "Yarneliff, I know, aids thee; but it will take an immense sum to fit out a proper ex- pedition." "That sum is already at my command, my lord." "Thou art a mystery, Sir Henry-an utter mystery! Fortune smiles on thee in every wayl I shall question thee no more. Hast seen my daughter this morning?" *s   "I have not, my lord, but purpose seeking her presence immediately to say farewell, for I must be in the saddle again. I have a visit of duty to pay to the roof-tree beneath which I first saw light, and then I must away upon the path which fortune hath opened for me." "regret thy haste. After thou hast seen Helen, come to me; and we at least will take a stoup of wine together to thy future fame. Thou knowest where to find me." CHAPTER XXV. Before we describe the parting scene with Lady Helen of Cacrmarthen, we must look back to Coraline once. Her father. was absent with Morgan but a little while, when lie took him from her presence to look upon the stu- por-stricken forms of Percival and Brompton, who, having drank drugged wine, lay helpless upon the cot, as we described in a former chapter. On the return of the old man and the knight, refreshments, as he desired, were ready; and Morgan took a single goblet of wine. But more he would not; for his heart was heavy. The father of Coraline had ad- vised his immediate departure for the court, since the peril whichrYarncliff had feared was now removed; and bade him boldly offer to the king to replenish his treasury from the riches. of the Spaniards, if he would grant his commission to make war upon them wherever found, on land or sea-the commis- sion to be private; but such as to guarantee him safety from the penalty of piracy. Morgan saw at a glance the great opportu- nity for fame and wealth which this would lay before him; and when his benefactor bade him be in no fear for a ship or men-that they should be provided to his hand-he felt that to obey his every wish was a duty. Was he not Coraline's fatler? That was enough for Mergan. He would have walked to the acaffold at his command. Ethelbert had already prepared his daugh- ter's mind for this inevitable parting; and though she, too, was sad, she strove to be cheerful, and cast as much light on the gloom of her lover as she could. The father, well knowing that his presence was a restraint, after a single cup of wine, rose, and telling Morgan that he would hastily prepare his letter for Lord Yarncliff, and other missives for men already in the Southern Seas, whose aid he could command, left them alone. "It'is hard to find thee, and then so soon be forced to lose sight of thee, dear lady," said Morgan, as he pressed the unresisting hand of Coraline to his lips. "Though oceans separate us, so long as love lasts we lose not sight of one another 1"   said she. And her dark eyes looked full in his; for hers was not a timid love. It was pure and soulful, and fervent as her untaught nature. "Had I never met thee, lady, ambition had been my only bride!" "Let her be thy guide still. Look upward and onward--fancy that I am ever near thee. My father hath promised me thy hand; but/ succcss mustfirst crown thy efforts. And by that time, thou must win a power over the king which none of his nobles can now exert. Thou kncwest one part of the mystery which hangs around my father-not all. As thy bride, I would mingle with England's proud- est dames at the royal court; but never will I do so until my father, with the title of his heritage and the honors of his race restored to him, freb and untinted, is received by the king. Though I love thee-and blush not to own it; for thou art all worthy-never can I be thine without these conditions are ful- filled!" "If my heart's best blood, freely shed-ii 'daring deeds may win success, and crown thy wishes, lady, fear not for the aesult. The hope before me makes me anxious for the trial. I can say farewell; for I feel that it is not forever. Were it forever, desperation might supply the place of hope; but death, not glory, would 1 seek for!" The re-entrance of Ethellert, with his dis- patches and documents, now interrupted this colloquy. "The day will soon dawn; and 'tis best that thou shouldst be in the castle ere thy ab- sence is noted," said he. "There is a scroll here, with thy directions; read, and then, after its contents are graven on thy memory, destroy it. Thou wilt find the ship, armed and equipped as I describe, and her officers need to those seas, ready for your orders. We will meet again-meet ere thou dost leave the coast, if thou dost implicitly obey thy sailing-directions. When off St. David's Head, lay thy ship by the wind, and wait un- til I bring thee the two slaves, womn I shall keep in their present restraint until then. If thou dost not teach them a lesson while in the Indies, thou art more merciful than they de- serve!" "They shall not find an easy master!" said' Morgan bitterly. "Say thy farewell to Coraline, and I will see thee forth," continued Ethelbert. "Let it bebrief, for time is precious. Perchance ye yet may meet again before the coast is left behind thee i'" Brief but tender, yet without unmanly or unwomanly weakness, was that parting; for love and hope were linked hand in hand, and stood between those hearts, to give them ^ strength.   CHAPTER XXVI.  Dressed with more than usual care, even as t f she had hopes that her great loveliness, t with its additional adornments, would yet win back his truant heart, Lady Helen received c Sir Henry Morgan in her boudoir.    i When he stated to her that he was about to leave, and in an hour or two more at far- thest, would be in the saddle, she turned 1 deathly pale, and gaspingly asked, why he was in such haste to depart from the scenes of his early boyhood? 1"My duty to my king and to myself call me hence, fair lady. And it ill becomes one so young in knighthood to rest, before he proves by further deeds of arms, that he is not un- worthy of the honor bestowed by fortune up- on him!" "Would that I were a man!" sighed the lady. And while she spoke,a thought seemed to flash across her mind-and, while her face lightetL up with expression, she asked: "JUlon what service is Sir Henry about to enter-to what land are his eyes turned?" ", To many, fair lady! It is probable that my path will lie across the sea. I hope to be sent against the Spaniards in the Western In- dies, and upon the Southern Main!" :' A land that is sunny and beautiful-where winter liver dwells. It is pitiful to think that wh re Nature makes all things lovely, man should mar its beauty by his deeds. Yet, have I heard that the Spaniards, cruel in their nature, have done great wrong to those who owned the soil-robbed them of their homes and treasure, enslaved them, broken them in spirit!" "It is true, lady; but the day of reckoning Is coming with the Spaniards-they shall learn to dread my name!" "I would I were a man!" sighed the lady again. "It is hard to be forever cooped up within the bounds of my father's estates, when my spirit yearns to see life, and the world- the ever-busy world. I wish I were a man, that I, too, might gird on a sword, and fight where brave men fight, and die as brave men die!" "Life should be dear to thee, lady; and manhood's path is a rugged and a weary one!" "Life is worthless to me now!" said the lady, with a voice which trembled in spite of her efforts to hide all agitation. "But thy visit was, if I err not, to bid me farewell? it pains me'to utter the word ; but I tell thee Sir Henry, though it is uttered, I feel that we will meet again!" "I hope so, fair lady--I hope 9o; and that when we meet I shall see thee well and hap- py still, as now-thyfather's blessing and his ,ride. Farewell, kind lady-farewell!" He bowed low, kissed her trembling hand, and, while she stood pale and still as a statue,   without sufficient control of her feelings to trust her lips with a reply, he turned and left the room. For some time she stood and looked at the door through which he passed, without speak- ing. Then, in a low whisper, she iaid: "I did not say farewell, Henry Morgan-I did not say farewell. Blasted bt my lips ere I utter the word-which would rend my heart- chords asunder! No, Henry Morgan, it is not farewell to thee-never; for Helen of Caer- marthen cannot live apart from thee! If not mine, never shall another possess thee! IIf in peril, no hand but mine shall save thee I It is not farewell!" CHAPTER XXVII. "Thou art welcome back, my brave young friend; but why in such haste?" was the first expression which Lord Yarncliff uttered, as the hero of this story entered his lordship's cabinet in London.  "I advised a longer stay i" "This letter, my lord, will explain to thee the cause of my speedy return," replied the young knight, handing the peer a package. Lord Yarncliff opened it, and his face glow- ed with pleasure as lie read its contents. "So they are caged!" he said; and he closed the letter. "The king should be in- formed of this daring act of villainy on Per. cival's part, so far as intention went, but our friend thinks it better not, lest 'he might be compromised; and says he will take care of the. precious couple until means, already pro- vided for their transport, can be brought to his hand. His advice, regarding the service fitted for thy sword and ambition, is excellent, and will exactly suit the king; for I have but , now returned from a consultation with him and l the Lord of the Exchequer, upon the means i of replenishing the treasury, without resort- ing to further taxation. If thou wilt, I will send aid crave an early audience, and thou shalt in. person lay thy plans before him; for i thy friend and benefactor tells me that he has posted the thoroughly thereupon." "Than , my kind and noble friend. All I ' shall crae of his majesty, at first, is a free e commision to war upon the Spaniards'in f thos Lsouthern seas, in reprisal for their wrongs upon our people there-whom they ? have driven from the Honduras, where they , were cutting 'logwood. That commission e given, I shall only report when I send him treasure; and when I have sent him enough t to purchase the crown-jewels of every empire - and kingdom in Christendom-which I can s and will do-I shall ask a favor 1' He will deny thee nothing!" ", He must not deny that which I will ask, , though his oath is registered against it; for at   my hopes of happiness on earth are centred in it!" "His oath! I begin to understand thee. Thou seekest a full pardon for Sir William." "I do; and his reinstatement in all the honors of his name and race-his forfeited estates to be his own again, That done, and his daughter's hand is mine! Now, my lord, thou canst see the stake for which I play! Is it not worth the hazard of a life?" "Ay, it is! For my old friend's sake, I am glad that he has an advocate who seems likely to succeed where I, with all my influ- ence, would labor in vain. For the king, strong in all his prejudices, Yro or con, hath ever evinced the most bitter hate toward his memory-whenever, by chance, it hath been brought before him. He thinks him a far-off exile, however, and dreameth not that he dwells within the realm. Percival's chances for life were ten to one in favor, were the king to light upon the two." "I pray that the mischance -may not hap- pen until I have paved the pathway of a re- conciliation with gold, and brightened it with jewels. But, my lord, I weary thee. I will but deliver another letter from our friend, to the Jew, Solomon, and then I will return to my quarters, and await thy convenience to attend the king!"  "It is well; but since thou speakest of the Jew, I have a word of caution to send him. Our monarch-I speak it with due respect- like all monarchs, has errors, and oni of his greatest is an undue fondness for the female sex, without regard to the rules of virtue. He saw the Jeweas, whom report speaks of as passing lovely, on the nkiht when thou didst receaes the honor of knighthood at his hands. I have reasoujto believe that lie has not for- gotten her, and will early seek to renew his acquaintance with her.' When a kin, wooes, he will have no denial. Let the Jew take note of this; and if he would not have the thing I hint of come 'to pass, remove his child to some safer place! And mark thee, let him not know from what source the information ame."           I "I surely will not, my lord; though the Jew, who seems to value her above all his gold and jewels, would be rarely grateful for thy warning, as am I who feel belholden to them for their kindness, even though they are not Christians But I will not delay my visit longer. A good evening, my lord." And the young knight hastened away, for the news which he had just heard gave him great uneasiness; for though he felt no deep- er interest, yet he respected the beautiful Jewess, and felt'that she shbuld, even as if shb were his sister, be shielded from wrong. For he was not yet so much a courtier as to be.   lieve that a female of lower rank could be honored rather thandegraded by a liaison with a king. CHAPTER XXVIII. the knock of the young knight, though night had already cast its shadow over the great city, drew the Jew to his usual post or observation; for the visits of his most sensi- tive customers were generally made in the evening, for few wlho hold position in ,cietv like to have their financial wants known abroad-as they surely mwould be if they were observed to visit the house of a money-lender in the light of day. An exclamation of joyful surprise broke from the lips of the Jew, as by the light or the lamp in his hand, he recognized the per- son of our hero. He hastened to unbar his door, and in a very few moments he clasped the extended hand of the knight, and bade him welcome. "My child will be delighted to see her preserver!" he said, as after carefully rebar- ring his massive' door, he led the way to the inner part of the house. 6"We were speaking of thee not an half hour since-for thy speedy return, for though our chief persecutor hath been banished, yet we have reason to fear that his friends-for even the most wicked have friends-will d*. us injury for his sake!" "g From them thy least danger; pause here, before we enter the presence of thy daughter, and I will warn thee against a greater!" said Morgan, detaining the Jew in the room where he usually conducted his business. Here lie revealed to him, without implicat- ing the source of his information, the danger of which Lord Yarncliff hail spoken. Solomon was struck momently silent with surprise and terror. He knew that the king, however just in many things, had the repu- tation of being lawless in his passions. And Morgan had spoken truly when he said that tihe Hebrew father, though he loved his wealth, loved his child far more than all the wealth on earth. 1"God of Abraham!" lie moaned, as soon as he could speak. "God of my fathers! will 'the shadow of the cloud never pass from be- fore me? Must all my way be dark? Miriam -my Miriam-all that is left of my lost lone, must she be torn from me? No! no! The. king shall never find her--neven!. I will slay her, and bury her fair body unpolluted ere his unholy eye shall ever rest on her again!"I it Do not rave' so wildly, good Solomon," said the knight, in a kindly tone. "It will not be difficult to save her from danger, and thyself from further persecution." "' Show me but that-aid me in doing that,   and half my wealth is thine, good knight-- ay, more, if thou dost ask it!" "I ask no reward. The pleasure of serv- ing thee and thy fair child were sufficient re- compense." "Thou, a Christian, dost not feel love for my child, a Jewess?" And Solomon, as if his heart was filled with a sudden and unpleasant suspicion, eyed the young knight keenly, as if he would read the reply in his face before his lips spoke it. "I respect her, friend Solomon, and would shield her from wrong as I would a sister. I have no stronger feeling than that for her." "It is well-thou art good and noble be- yond any of thy race whom fate hath ever cast in my way. Tell nme how thou canst avert this peril and save us." "I will. It is likely, that very soon I shall depart from the kingdom with one or more ships, to cruise against the Spaniards in the Indies, and on the Southern [Main. If thou Bhouldst gather thy property together, so that thou couldst have it transported to some safer realm or spot, I would offer free passage to thee and thine, and undertake to conceal thy departure, if thou wilt be advised by me, so that none but ourselves will be the wiser for the manner of thy leaving the realm." "Thou dost give me hope, noble knight- hope to a heart that but now was buried in despair. I will be cheerful, even in any fears, and meet each plan thou dost propose with my fullest acquiescence! "It is well, good Solomon. We will now visit thy daughter. but utter to her no word to alarm her. My visit must be brief, for on the morrow I will have audience with the king. Then I shall know how soon I am to sail, and such particulars as will enable thee to shape thy course. Thou shalt have early knowledge of all through my faithful Malak." "T Thanks, most noble knight! we will now hasten in, for my child will rejoice to see thee!" CHAPTER XXIX. Not, as upon the previous occasion, before his assembled court, but in his private cabi- s net did King Charles grant a second audi- x  ence to Sir Henry Morgan and his friend, i Yarneliff. "Thou hast made brief use of the furlough i we gave thee," said the king, as our hero' 1 knelt to kiss the royal hand. "Art now  v ready for service '  "  , "Ready and anxious to serve my king t where most my service may be needed," re- plied the young knight, as fe rose and stood r before the kin/g.            ( "My Lord Yarneliff mentioned to us, when t he sought an audience for thee, thy plans and' g   - thy desires. The plane please us, and if they are successful thou art a made man, and will - not stand second to any peer in our realm. - But we warn thee, that if thou dost fail, we shall know thee not, and thou wilt sink as a r mere adventurer; for we cannot openly es- pouse thee without thou art a bold and con- a stant victor." eo "If your majesty but grants me the comr- "mission I ask for, I fear not failure!. If re- verses come, on my own head let them fall. I But I need the commission to gather men already in those seas, and that my prizes may be legally condemned in the royal port of Jamaica. whither I shall send themn, and r whence I will not be long in trasmitting trea- t sure to my royal master!" "The plan is good. The commission, con- I stituting thee an admiral and giving thio power to make reprisals in those seas, shall be made out under the royal seal ere this day's sun goes down. We need not tell thee to strike boldly and with haste, for France may take umbrage, and we may not quarrcl with her to advantage at present." I "Fear not, your majesty, for amyy sloth on my part. I am too young to tire easy, my ambition hath not yet stretched its wingsi, though its glance sweeps far ahead." "Thou must have good friends-we hear that a ship hath been provided thee." "It is so, your majesty." "Our treasury runs low, but we will see that yet another is fitted to go out under thy command. There is one Brodely, a man of great experience in those seas, now near at hand, as we have been informed by one who sought a like commission for him. Seek out the man, and if he pleaseth thee, we will ap- point him thy vice-admiral and fit him to ae- company thee." "thankyour majesty." "Tush! Thanks are but words I Let thy deeds prove thy gratitude. Is there aught else of favor we can grant thee, or any person we can send with thee to aid thee in thy en- terprise?" "I have need of but one, your majesty," said Morgan, as a thought flashed like light.. ning on his mind-a plan that he might remove the Jew from London without incur- ring the royal displeasure, since his real mo- tive would be obscured beneath the ostensi- ble one. "I am but a poor judge of gems of value, and but a sorry accountant at best. In the prizes and among the spoils which I shall take, there will doubtless be mnany jewels. A portion of these spoils, of course, must go to reward the crews who peril their lives to ob- tain them. The rest, I destine for the royal treasury; for I will not reserve a pound of gold for myself beyond my expenses. It *   your majesty will permit me to seek out and select some fitting person to aid me in the valuation and proper distribution of that which I may capture, I shall be grateful." "' Seek out and select such person as thou deemest fit, and thou shalt have an order for his company, even if he be a peer of the realm. And now He speedy in thy prepara- tion, yet silent as to thy business and desti- nation. Let it be given out that thou art go- ing on a trading voyage to the China Seas. See Brodely at once, and let us know if a commission to serve under thee shall be giv- en him." The audience was at an end, and our hero's every wish and plan was fairly under way. CHAPTER XXX. In a corner of the large tap-room of an inn bearing the name of the "Jolly Sailor," sat a man, whose silvery locks and grizzly beard betokened him to have considerably passed tile meridian of life. Yet the color of his face was as ruddy as would be that of a youth yet in his teens. Iis keen blue eye was bright and full of humor. His features were good, and, in truth, he would have been handsome had not a most unprepossessing sear extended from his left eyebrow down across the opposite chllek, leaving its mark on the bridge of his aquiline nose. It was ev- idently the token of a sabre-cut which had nearly quieted his humor for life. The dress of this person indicated him to be a sea-faring man, and its richness that he was above the rank of a common sailor. He sat at a table by himself, with a bottle of wine before him and a pipe, from which he took an occasional whiff. seeming to watch with quiet humor the in-coming and out-going of the many patrons of the "Jolly Sailor," the most of whom, being sea-faring men, came in to take a convivial glass, crack jokes with their companions, or to exchange news regarding the port, etc. While this person was so occupied, an in- dividual entered, whose garb strangely con- trasted with that of the usual visitors to the inn, and the landlord hastened from behind the bar to render in person any service which this visitor might require, instead, as usual, of sending one of his pretty bar-maids to re- eeive his orders. For it was seldom that a knight with plumed cap and golden spurs entered that inn. The knight was followed by a servant, whose floe was as black as ebony. In short, for there is no mystery in the matter, the newcomer was no other than Sir Henry Morgan, and he was accompanied by Malak. "What wilt thou   have, most noble knight?"' asked the landlord, obsequiously.   "I seek for one Captain Brodely-doth he tarry here?" replied the knight. "T answer that hail, sir knight! What may be thy pleasure with me?" said the per- son whom we have partially described, rising from his sent in the corner. "I will tell thee presently, if the landlord of this inn will afford us a room where we can discourse in private over a flagon of good wine!" replied the knight. "The room thou shalt have, most worship- ful knight, and for the wine, none better ever crossed the Channel, without paying duty I And so saying, the landlord bustled away to prepare for his distinguished visitor. In a moment, he returned and said: "Follow me, most worshipful knighlt-.  Captain, I have prepared the Blue Chamber for his worship!" "It is enough-I know the way; if the wine is there we can dispense with thy serv- ices, Father Bolter!" said the mariner, him. self leading the way. "But I would prefer to see if his worship likes the winel" persisted the landlold whoso curiosity was pretty thoroughly ax cited, and who would much have liked t learn the subject of his conference with Brodely, who had been a very good custom- er to him. "The wine will be well enough-we hav i business and to time to waste We wish :no  intrusion!" said the knight, entering the  open door of the "Blue Chamber," probably so designated from the azure hue of its ceil  iAg. As the captain, entering with him, closed the door immediately, and Malak. who had followed close behind, stood as a sentinel be- tween him and the key-hole, the worth'y land- lord was obliged to return to his bar as wise as he was when he left it. "Never mind-he slall pay all the dea-er for his wine!" he muttered. The conference between Captain Brodely and the knirht lasted for an hour or more, and was evidently of a friendly nature, for a second flagon of wine was sent for, which ra- ther restored the humor of the landlord, whose temper had been ruffled in consequence of his baffled curiosity. When it ended, the knight descended into the tap-room with the captain, and without asking the price of the wine, tossed a couple of golden doubloons or the bar, and merely saying to Brodely: "At my quarters to-night, and thy com-  mission shall be ready"-passed out. followed by Malak, who had not opened his lips while in the building. The landlord, who had received more than double what he would have charged the strange knight, was speeohles for a moment   with delight, but his curiosity soon set his jaw-tackle a-run and his talking apparatus in motion. "I prithee tell me, dear captain, who was that noble knight? I never laid eyes on a more gallant-looking man!" "He answers to the name of Sir Henry Morgan!" said Brodely, refilling the pipe which he had laid down when Morgan first entered. "Doth he follow the sea?" "-No I But the sea may follow him if he scuds before it! But I've no time to answer many questions, Father Bolter. I must be off to look me up a ship-thou must have my score ready, for I shall slip my cable in a fewdays!" "Ah! Whither bound?" asked the land- lord with a sigh, for it gave him sorrow to lose a good customer. "To the China seas, most likely. I sail with the knight!"  "Even so! There is money to be made in the trade of those seas, I doubt not. But I wonder much that a young knight should turn merchant!" "Doth not a knight need money as much as any other man?" "Ay, good captain. But be hath a trade -his trade is war; I am sure that should pay!" ' Not in times of peace, good Boniface-if men were not to get hhungry or dry, where would thy trade be! 'Thou ecedest never grumble for thy trade,/ however, ifr men must eat and drink!"  "True, good captain, but they fill their bellies first, and then grumble that they must pay for it-not all, but seven out of ten do I But to thy voyage. Wilt 'list thy men at my house?" The last question and its reply was impor- tant to the landlord; for in those days, as at present, grog had to flow freely where the work of enlisting a crew was going on, and he saw a hanrvest ahead if the captain made the "Jolly Sailor" his head-quarters until his time of sailing. "I will see. after my prior arrangements are made!" said the captain, and he left the house upon his errand. CHAPTER XXXI. "All is ready, my good lord-my ships wait but my presence on board to weigh an- ehor and spread their sails to the breeze. I have paid my last devoirs to the king, and now come to pay the like duty to thee, and to crave thy good wishes and tlhy blessing ere I set forth upon a venture from which I never will return without successenor until my name has become a terror to the Spaniards of the southern seas!"   These were the words of Henry Morgan used to Lord Yarncliff only a few days after the interview which the young knight held with Captain Brodely, now his vice-admiral, whose skill and experience had aided him vastly in hurrying his preparations for th voyage. "My blessing and my best wishes are thine, Sir Henry! I need not tell thee that prudence should ever go hand in hand with valor, for tihowart prudent beyond thy years. But as one who has served, let me caution thee never to let a victory put thee off thy guard; restrain thy men more after a battle tha be. fore!" said the kind peer. A retainer entered at this moment, and bowing to Morgan, placed a letter in his hands. "Where is the bearer of this 9" asked the latter, after he had perused the content oi the letter. "He waits in the hall below!" replied ti servitor. "Pardon *me, my lord, thio letter is from Earl Cedric, commending the bearer, a young man from his section, distantly related to his own family, to my friendship. He says the young man wishes to enter my service; and the earl has done me too nmany kindnesses, when I was comparatively friendlees, for me to refuse a request like this!" '"Thy reasons are good-the young man is well connected, and may prove worthy of his stock. Hadst thou not better have him called hither?" "I will not trouble thee With his presence, my lord; for I must at once bet out for my ship. I am waited for, anrd can converse with the stranger while on the way; for, on the earl's commendation, I slall at once accept him, and afterward appoint him to such post as I may find him worthy and competent to fill. Accept my ever-grateful thanks for thy past kindness, and my adieux. Thou shalt hear of me, as well as from me; and I will strive to make the news such by my acts, that thou wilt not regret thy patronage r' The noble peer pressed the hand of the hopeful young knight, and bade him farewell. When Morgan entered the hall, guided by the servitor who had brought him the letter, he found the youth who had borne it sitting near the window, sound asleep. "He must be wearied with his long jour. ney-probably has traveled far without rest," said Morgan, as lbe looked upon the slumber- ing boy; for a boy be seemed to be, in years -not more than sixteen at most, with a slight, yet elegant form. His complexion was very dark-too dark to look well, with his nut- brown hair. "I can detect a family-likeness in the boy' features," said Morgan, as he gazed intently   on him. "His frame is too slight to endure hardship; 'tis a pity the earl sent such a stripling to me, for his will be a hard and a perilous life, if he follows my fortunes!" Approaching more closely, he laid his hand gently on the youti's -shololder, who started, and, springing to his feet, gazed wildly about him, as if he had been awakened from a dream of terror, or else felt great fear. "Thou must be weary, young friend, else thou weuldst not slumber so easily!" said the knight, speaking kindly; for he pitied the confusion of the boy. "Very wery, noble sir. I have ridden nirht and day from Caermarthen, lest the no- ble knight, Sir Henry Morgan, shouldw depart cre I could jil him. Am I yet in tine, most noble sir?" "Thou art; for I am he! It is strange that thou hast not met me before. Tliy coun- tenance looks very fiamiliar; wert thou not at the castle when I was there?" "I was there soon after thy departure, noble sir. I learned from my cousin, Lady Helen- she lets meo call her cousin, though we are some three degrees removed in blood-that thou wcrt bound upon some great enterprise ; and I could not rest until I got permission to come and offer my poor aid." "What canst thou de with arms?" "Learn, under so brave a master, how to use them?" "Thy answer pleases me; thou shalt have a trial. But thou must brace thee for a short journey; for we must aboard ship immedi- ately. This servant will bring thee a goblet of wine ; and we must away." "I need not the wine, noble master. I am alive now, and ready for action. A temporary weakness brought slumber to my eye-lids." And the youth, now fully recovered from the tremor and confusion which marked the first part of the interview, seemed indeed strong enough to endure additional fatigue. "Thy name is not mentioned in the letter of the earl!" said Morgan. "Be pleased to call me Constant-my first name-most noble sir, until I earn a better one!" "The name is good; and if thou dost live up to it in all honorable undertakings, thou wilt do well. If thou art ready, we will move on." "' I am ready, Sir lenry, to follow wheresoev- er thou shalt lead or go-where'er thlu biddest me to go!" CHAPTER XXXII. TlE GRAND OLD OCEAN ONCE MORE! My worn heart throbs like its deathless wavs, as through memory's eye I look back upon its lone bosom, where I was tossed and eradled in the sinless, joyful hours of my   childhood. But be still,^sad heart: 'brain, to E thy thankless work; go onr with thy story. Two ships, large, and in their rig and ar mament fully fitted for war, were standing in I toward "St. David's Head," in St. George's , Channel, but a few days later than the date ; of events in our last chapter. The first had i been named the "Demon of the Sea," by her admiral, Sir Henry Morgan; and her figure- head, representing a fiery dragon belching lightning from its mouth, was symbolic of , her name. Having been told how much stress the Spaniards laid on names and symbols, Morgan had purposely sB named and prepar. ed his vessel, so that when he had, as he in- tended, struck such blows as would make them know his power, their terror might aid in easier, conquests. From his main-mast head fluttered the red cro s of England on a blue ground ; but from tie fore was display- -ed a white'flag, having on it a red heart pierc- ed wilh a dagger. The Spaniard might well deem that this flag mcleant)leath wit hout quar- ter; but, in truth, Morgan had adopted it for his pennant, because it was the symbol of the ring whichltaroline had first placed upon his finger, which he still wore. The other ship, commanded by his vice- admiral, John Brodely, wore only the national colors, and kept a little way astern, without hail, but within signal distance. As the ships neared the bold headland spo- ken of, Morgan, standing on his high quartch- deck, looked shoreward often and anxiously L for it was here that Ethelbert, his best friend and patron, had promised to pay him a final visit. "Dost thou recognize those mountains, Constant?" he asked of the young man who stood by his side. "' They look like the hills of Caermarthen, my noble master!" replied the youth, who was rather paler from the effects of sea-sick- ness than when we last saw-him. "They are the hills of Caermarthen, and we are now taking a last look at dear old Wales, perhaps for years, perhaps forever, for we know not the future, shape our ends as we may to form it to our wishes!" "There is a small vessel making off toward us from the shore!" said Constant. "' Thine eye is quick, my boy! I expect a visitor, and must wait for him!" replied the knight. And turning to his chief officer, Morgan bade him have the ship hove to, with her sails aback, and so trimmed as to keep her stationary-signaling to Brodely to do the same. While these manouvres were being execut- ed, .e closely scanned the approaching vessel through his tlescope, and recognized the boae to be the same which he had seen moor- ed in the little harbor fronting the oavern-   home of Ethelbert. And distant though the! boat was-a full league-he saw tie flutter of white garments, and his heart told him that Caroline was one of the passengers, Laying his glass down on the binnacle, he went below to his cabin. When he left the deck, Constant, who had already learned its use, took up the telescope, and, with nervous eagerness, looked at the approaching vessel. "What visitors can he expect from Wales?" muttered the youth. "There are six persons in the boat, and one-one is a WOMAN!" The young man's hand trembled, so that he could scarcely keep the glass steady while he said this. "What woman is there in Wales who should visit him? Strange-strange-STRANGE!" "What dost thou make out, my boy?" ask- ed Sir Henry, coming on deck at this in- stant.          .  "Nothing, sir: that is, sir, I was only count- iog the persona coming in yonder shallop)!' replied the youth, in great confusion, laying down the glass. "Iow many are there?" asked the knight, not noticing the boy's confusion-for his eye was fixed upon the now rapidly-nearing boat. "Six, air! And one is a lady, judging from the flutter of her snow-white gar- ments!" And when he said this, the keen eye of the youth eagerly scanned his master's ace, as if to see what expression his words would pro- duce. But the face told no tale-he merely replied: "Ay, they are the visitors I expected!" And then lie bade his chief officer prepare to receive the visitors with all the honors of the ship. "Thyself and the crew will see one whom they have been accustomed to honor. Let his welcome prove that lie is not forgotten!" said the young admiral. The officer went forward among the crew to Issue the necessary orders, and then returned to ask itthe admiral wished a salute fired with the great guns. "No," was the reply. "Not that we be- grudge the use of powder, but the echoes of artillery might reach ears that I care not to disturb, and open eyes which may as well be closed at present. Let a guard of honor, un- der arms, stand at the gangway, and the yards be manned with the crew, ready to cheer when their old commander's foot presses this deck once more. As his boat nears us, dip our colors thricel" The officer bowed, and departed to give the necessary orders; and Morgan again bent his eye on the boat, which, with a fresh breeze on its beam, was swiftly nearing him. He did not notice the manner of the youth by his side, the strange nervousness which   seemed to shake his frame. If he had, he surely would have striven to learn its cause. CHAPTER XXXIII. But a little while passed, and the boat of Ethelbert was close aboard the ship. Morgan gave the signal; the colors were lowered and raised three times-or " dipped," in nautidal parlance; the seamen sprung out on every yard and gave nine lusty cheers, and the ad- miral himself raised his hat, while his glance rested on the form of the fair being who, waving her kerchief in return, stood by the side of her father in the after-partoof the shal- lop, which now luffed up alongside. The gangway ladder was already lowered, and Morgan, stepping over the side, extended his hand first to Caroline, and then to her fa- ther, aiding both to pass upover the lofty bul- warks of his vessel. He was about to lead the way to the cabin, while the crew, renewing their cheers, prov- ed their recognition of their former leader in Ethelbert, when the latter, motioning with his hand for silence, signified his wish to ad- dress the crew. In a moment the order was given, and the men, gathering down from aloft, and from every part of the ship, stood in a dense mass in the waist of the vessel, where hs voice could reach every ear. "Officers and men: ye who have followed me many a time to victory on the sea, behold in him who is now to lead you-the son of rmy heart's adoption. Obey him as ye obeyed me; follow him as ye have followed me, and ye will meet brighter fortune than ye yet have seen. He is brave, and bears the kint' commission. Let the world hear of the deeds performed by him and his brave buccaneers I I am old, and my arm hath not the strength it once had, or I would again strike with ye and under his command, or he was born to lead and to conquer. But my best wishes go with ye. Be ye true to him as ye were to me!" "We will! Long live our old commander! Long life to our admiral l" were the shouts which rose from almost every lip. "I have two slaves for thee in the boat, son Henry. Order them brought up. As they were inclined to be unruly, I had them, chained; as they were sancy, I had them gagj ged, and so kept them until I brought them within reach of thy discipline!" "Had I not best escort thy Caroline into the cabin first. Or here, Constant, show this fair lady into the cabin. I will be there with thy father preseitly, dear lady!" The youth whom he addressed had stood all this time gazing, as if spell-bound, upon the wonderful beauty of Coraline, not seemn m   ing to have listened to the harangue of her father, or noticed anything or anybody but her. The words of his master, .however, seemed to recall him to himself; for he bow- ed, blushed almost girlishy, and, without speaking, preceded the lady to the cabin. Morgan now gave orders to bring the two "slaves" from the boat, and Malak, who still acted as his confidential servant, superintend- ed the operation, for he well knew who they were. But Morgan never would have recognized the individuals who were passed over the side, Lad not their own voices proclaimed it the moment the gags were removed from their lips. Fortwo more eingular-looklng be- ings never were seen on a ship's deck. The herds of both had been shaven close to the skull; and their skulls, as well as their faces, were dyedl a nut brown. They were clad in tight-fit'ing motley suits, such as were worn by clowns and mountebanks at fairs; and the air of gentility which they strove to assume, as they stood before the admiral, sat so ri- diculously on them, that he could not refrain from laughter. "By Saint George, the day will come when thou shalt not laugh at me, Sir Henry Morgan, if life is left me!" cried one of these singular- looking persons. "Why, insolent slave, who art thou that darest thus address me on board mine own ship!" cried the knight, in well-feigned sur- prise. "Thou knoweat well that I am Lord Per- cival, even though I have been thus shame- fully disfigured!" cried the person, in a tone of the bitterest anger. *"And I, his friend, George Brompton!" mid the other. "Honest George!" added Ethelbert, with a sneer. "Thou a   Percival-a peer of England " cried Morgan. "Why that cannot be-Per- cival was banished by the king. He was as white as his-own cowardly liver when last I saw him-he cannot have changed into a blackamoor so soon. Thou'rt mistaken. Thou art my slave; I've bought thee of this old gentleman, and if thou dost behave quietly and well. I will treat thee kindly-if not, the lash shall teach thee and thy fellow-slave duty and obedience. Not a word! Thy name Job henceforth learn to bear thy lot pa- tiently!" "Thou hadst better call me Jonah, Sir Knight, for by heaven I'll prove one to thee!" "Attempt it, snd thou shalt go overboard, and take thy chances ii a shark's belly. But I have no time to spate it converse with a slave. Malak, see those slaves into fitting quarters. Have work for them, and have a guard set to wach them. The )eart word or   rsign of rebellion against my rule shnll be heavily punished." "Take our lives at once, but do not subject us to further indignity!" pleaded Perciai, in a humbler tone. Morgan rendered no reply; but, turning on his heel, accompanied the father of Coralisa into his cabin. CHAPTER XXXIV. When Constant conducted Coraline into the splendidly-furnished cabin of the ship, he did not return to his master, but remained there, gazing at the lady, while she moved about the  apartment examining the paintings, of which there were many. A magnificent harp stand- ing in the after-part of the cabin attracted her attention. Running her jeweled fingers over its chords in a manner which betokened a perfect knowledge of the use of the instru. ment, she asked of the youth: "Doth thy master use this instrument, young man " '  "I know not, lady," stammered the youth, with such confusion, and in such a tone, that the lady raised her dark eyes, and regarled him more intently than she ihad before. The youth seemed still more confused ly the inquiring look which she cast upoln hint; and, turning his bead away, looked from the cabin window into the waves which rolled and tossed atern. "It is possible that'thou canst play, for thou lookest like one of gentle breeding?" continued the lady. The youth made no reply. "How long hast thou been in the service of Sir Henry?" asked Coraline, again. "But a few days, fair lady.* What post dost thou hold?" "  He calls me his secretary and aid, lady: my duty is, to keep his journals and obey his orders. He bade me conduct thee to the cabin: having done so, permit me to retire, for lie may need me on deck." ' To go there were needless trouble, since I hear his voice and that of my father ap- proaching." And as she said, Morgan and her father at that moment entered the cabin. "My dear Sir Henry, I was but now asking thy secretary here, what use thou didst make of this harp, and he was unable to tell me.' , "He could not, in truth, fair lady; for there is a secret connected with it, which hath so far, been kept from him and all on board but my faithful Malak. But now that we are fairly at sea, and soon to point our prows across the blue Atlantic, the secret need be hidden no longer. Come forth, good Solomon, here is an old friend of thine-come forth, and bring thy fair daughter with thee, that I may in all brotherly kindness introduce her to one of her   own sex, who possesseth every angel-attribute that the earth-born may own." As he said this, the young admiral threw open the door of a small side-cabin, and, to the utter astonishment of Constant, as evinced by the expression of his face, revealed the person of the old Jew, and his beautiful daughter. The Hebrew hurried forward to seize the extended hand of Ethelbert, at the same time speaking to him in his own language, to which the other replied with ease. Coraline, while she advanced a step, as if to meet the Jewish maiden, looked inquiring- ly at Morgan. He understood her mute ques- tilning and said: ( This maiden and her father were perse- cuted and in great peril. I availed myself of my power, and, acting under motives which I know my Coraline will approve, offered them passage to a place of safety." "Thou hast done well. Lady, I congratulate thee upon thy safety, for I know thou art in the hands of honor and of truth," replied Coraline. "Thanks sweet lady, thanks," said Miriam, gently. ' Art thou to brighten our voyage with thy presence, also?" "No-mine is but a visit, and I must back to the shore when his conference with Sir Henry is ended."  "I grieve to learn that thou art not to re- main; 'twill be a lonely voyage with not one of my sex on board to keep me company." "Thou mayest not find it so lonely after all -let me step into thy cabin with thee, and have a word in private, while our parents are to busy in converse with the admiral." And Coraline, drawing Miriam into the smaller cabin with her, closed the door. Meantime Constant, who had been regard- ing both with looks which evinced consider- able mental agitation, paced to and fro in the after-part of the cabin, while in the forward part Sir Henry and his two guests were pledg- ing each other in a generous cup of wine. The two ladies were absent but a little while in the cabin; and when they. ame forth, it was in sisterlike manner, arm in arm, as if they had known each other for years instead of mninute B But both turned their glances so intently oh Constant, that, he, in greater con- fusion tha ever, abruptly left the cabin. "Thy seretary is very bashful-he blushes like a girl when he is spoken to, and cannot bear a lady's glance!" said CoraliBe to Mor- gan, as Constant disappeared up the compan- ion-way. "I had not noticed the puliarity-in truth, I have noticed'little of the boy in any way. He came to me bearing aletter of commen- dation from Earl Cedrc, of Caermarthen, at the moment when I was prepared to sail. I   took him into service; and, as he seemed apt, and to be a good penman, made him my sec- retary." "Saidat thou he came from Caermarthen?" asked Coraline. "Commended by the earl, though from some other part of Wales. He is isistantly related to the earl. At least, so ran the letter, and so saith he." "Doth he not resemble Lady Helen in fea- ture?" "Now, that I think of it, in feature he doth considerbly ; but in stature he is less, and in complexion, almost as different as the night is from thet:day." A significant glance was exchanged between Miriam and Coraline, which was not noticed by the young knight-who, however, had seen, and with delight, the apparent friendship which they had formed. "I am glad, dear Coraline, that thou hast met poor Miriam with such sisterly courtesy. I would that thou wert so situated that thou couldst bear her company across the ocean, or she able to remain with thee-for it must be lonely, even though with her father, tp be for weeks, perchance for months, upon the sea, without companions of her own sex and na- ttre." "Why canst thou pot remain with me? asked Coraline. "'My home and all that I have will I share with thee." "I may not leave my father," said the Jew- ess. "Never while he lives, be it in darkness or in light, will I leave him." '"I love thee all the more that thou sayest so; for never will I desert my own dear fa- ther," said Coraline, while a tear shone like a jewel in her eye.  "There are those, however, who are not so dutiful, if our conjectures are righ!," said Mir- iam.  "Yes," replied Coraline; "and if they should be right, it seems to me that it would be our duty to aid in recalling one who 'has erred to a sense of propriety. ' But I must confer with my father ere I speak of this mat- ter further, lest any step of mine or ours should endanger his safety." "Thou art dealing in mystery, fair lady," said Morgan, "or art thou apealnng of some- thing which concerneth me not to know?" "Icannot yet say, Sir Henry. Do thou draw the father of Miriamaside a moment-I would confer with my father for an instant." Morgan did as she desired, and Coraline im- parted some information to her father, which seemed to surprise him mnuch, and annoy. him not a little. Morgan, though not an Inten- tional listener, could not avoid hearing that she urged upon him something which he per-+ emptorily refused to do, saying; "I will not *ndanger thee or myself-as thy wish would   surely do. If she hath dje this folly, let her  relieve herself the best hat she can. He 1 knoweth it not yet, and when he doth, will act 1 as becometh a good and true man: let that content thee!" Morgan was sorely puzzled to understand 4 these iysteries, and felt pained that Coraline i should hold a secret from him-for one evi. dently was on her mind. But her manner  changed after she had spoken with her father;  and leaving him, she gayly renewed a conver-  sation upon indifferent subjects with Miriam  -managing, however, again to draW*- er out  of hearing of the young admiral.  He was on the point of asking Ethelbert the meaning of these singularities; but the latter, immediately entering arain into cona- Tersation with So-omon, gave him no oppor- tunity. And in a short time, he signified to both that he felt it unnecessary to detain the ship longer from her voyage; and presenting Morgan with a package of papers for use in the ports to which he was bound, and also a private chart of various harbors generally un- known to mariners-not being laid down on the public charts-he called his daughter to him, and bade her prepare to return. Coraline took a kind and tender farewell of Miriam, pressing her lips to ler spotless brow, and uttering the kindest expressions of re- gard. To the father of the Jewess she also spoke most kindly; and then she said to Sir Ilenry: "We will say our parting words here -for I cannot speak before thy crew as I would 'here. Fare-thee-well, most noble knight thou bearest with thee my hope and my love. Return thou to fulfill the one, and receive all that the other can give." "I will, dear lady, or return not at all," said the knight, as he pressed her fair hand fervently to his lips. Ethelbert now accompanied his daughter to the deck, preceded by the admiral. Upon reaching the deck, at a sign from Morgan, the chief officer prepared to have the same honors rendered that had welcomed the visitors; but Ethelbert, observing this, desired the order countermanded; and without ceremony, wav- ing an adieu to the crew with his hanl, pass- ed into the boat which waited alongside. Morgan, who found it still hard to tear him- self from her dear company. accompanied Coraline over the side, and did not release her hand until she was seated in her father's boat, and it was ready to be east off. And then he uttered the unwilling word, "farewel." "Farewell!" said she. "Take good care of thy young secretary, and teach him not to be so bashfil in the presence of ladies." Morgan would have replied, asking her why she evinced so much interest in the stranger youth; but the bowline of the boat was already J   adrift, the sails were up, andhthe wind filling them, she veered away, and flew shoreward like a frightened bird. Regaining his deck, Morgan gave the order to fill away, and shaped his course so as to clear the channel, and strike his Atlantic line for Jitmaica, whither he was bound. His vice-admiral followed his example; and soon both vessels, under all the canvas which they could carry, were standing off the shore, to the delight of the elder and more experi. enced of the officers and men, who liked not to linger on that bleak and rock-bound coast, where gales are frequent and sudden, and not to be trifled with when they come. CHAPTER XXXV. Morgan, busied with observing the trim. ming of the sails and shaping the conure with his sailing-master, did not glance shoreward, until some time after the vessel had been head- ed out for the Atlantic. Then he went aft and looked to see if the shallop of Ethelbert was yet in sight. Far inland, almost lost in the shadow of the great gray cliffs, he saw a white speck, no bigger to the eye than the wing of the flying gull-that was all he could see of it, and in a few minutes that was lost to view. Turning, his eye rested upon his young secretary, who, with a sad look and tears yet wet on his cheek, was also looking toward the shore. ' Art home-sick already, my boy?" asked the knight, kindly. "' No, my master. have no home except where thou art," refied the youth, so mourn- fully, that his tone louched the heart of Mor- gan, and he said, all as kindly as before: "Then cheer up, my lad. Let us have smiles instead of tears." "I will try to be more cheerful, my kind master. Thy lady visitor was very beautiful." Ay, thou speakest truly, Constant. She seemed interested in thee; but said thou wert too bashful to converse with her, or answer her questioning." "I am not used to the society of ladies, my good master. And, I pray, when such visit thee, that I may be excused from attendance on-them." "Thou shalt hve thy wish, my boy; though, of necessity, as one of the occupants of my cabin, thou wilt be thrown somewhat into the society of the Jewess who is a passnger with us. But she is a kind and gentle creature, who has seen little or nothing of the world, and whose whole heart is bound up in love for her father." ti  4 And for thyelf, if I can read the heart of a woman through its mirror in her eye. Good master, do not deem me bold in saying this!' "I do not blame thee, Constant, or deem r thee over b*ld, yetthou dost tell me in one   breath that thou art all unused to the soeiety of ladies; and in the-next, thou tellest me that thou canst read the feelings of a lady's heart in the mirror of her eye." "I may be in error, my good master. But I noted, that though she talked with the other lady, her eye rested" on thee almost all the time; that when thou didst move from one place to another, her restless eytill followed thee, in the tenderest of glancee. I am sure she loves thee, my master." "As a sister may love a brother, perhaps- not otherwise." "Thou canst not say aA much of the other lady, my master. There surely was love-light in her eye."  "There thou are three-thirds right, my boy. There is no secret i] regard to the other lady-we are betrothed!'! A sigh so deep and heavy came from the bosom of the youth, as these words were ut- tered, that Morgan was surprised. "Why dost thou sigh so deeply?" he sked. 1 It is only a habit of mine, kind master. [ often sigh without a cause-without myself knowing why I sigh! The lady of thy love is very beautiful-far more beautiful than this lewess whom thou art bearing away from per- iecution. I used tor think my cousin Helen good-looking, but her beauty would be like a star seen through a cloud in the presence of thy lady!" "Thlou art quite a flatterer, Constant; and with a little teaching and practice, would make a tolerable courtier. But I must not stay on deck longer, or good Solomon and his daugh- ter will think that I have quite forgotten them. I wish thee to find the ship's steward, and bid him to come to me, and come thou with him. I have orders to give concerning the fare of the cabin." CHAPTER XxXVI. For five long weeks, the "Demon of the Sea" and her consort, the "War-hawk," bat- tled with rough surges and rude gales on the Atlantic, without meeting a single sail to Change the monotony of the voyage. But as they bad not yet reached the track of home- ward-bound galleons from Cuba or the Span- ish Main, in consequence of the adverse-winds, neither Morgan nor his followers deemed their fortunes bad, save so far as untoward weather was concerned. But-t iis time had not been lost. Morgan -himself a student of nautical science and the art of neaval warfare, as well as commander-- caused the men to be constantly exercised at arms by his more experienced officers, and by noting all the manoeuvres of the vessels, and each order given, he soon became as well fit-   ted to work his vessel in action as any officer on board. For Nature had endowed him with an almost miraculous rapidity of conception; and to see or hear a thing, with him, was to remember it forever. But at last, when just within the tropic lines, the monotony of the voyage was broken by the discovery of two ships, which from their course, had evidently come from the Carribean Sea, through the windward passage; for, 'by his latitude and longitude, Morgan was expect- ing every moment to make the Caycos Islands, intending thence to shape his course for Kingstown, in Jamaica, where he had author- ity from the king to have a prize-court estab- lished, and orders for the governor to extend to him aid and protection, while he punished the Spanish "pirates," who had driven the English logwood-cutters from Honduras and Campeachy. The reader, referring to history, will find that this was the pretext wlich the king ued for a cover to the real treasure- seeking object of this expedition-for England and Spain were not tien at open war.,  When these two ships were discovered from his masthead, Morgan instantly made signal for- the War-hawk to close up, for she was some ways astern; and, clearing his ship for action, signaled to Brodely to do the same. Sending his first officer aloft with the telex- cope, he anxiously waited to learn, through his experienced eye, whether they wrre Span- iards or not." "What dost thou make them out to be?" he asked of the lieutenant, after the latter had scanned the vessels for several minutee. "Two galleons, deeply laden, armed, and most surely Spaniards!' replied the officer. "The  have either not discovered us, oer- trusting in heavy metal and strong creB-- heed us not. There is no stir aboard either of them; but they come bowling down, with foam in their teeth, as careless as widows go- ing to a second wedding." "It is well. Let them come but within osu reach, and we will waken them from their dream of security." With right good will, the crews of both ships cleared for action, and when; as Brodely drew up close to Morgan, he announced his ship ready, the other gave a like announce. me; and the crews of both cheered so heart- ily, that it seemed strange the Spaniards did not hear them, though they were yet more than two leagues to windward. Morgan now Went into his cabin, and re- quested Miriam and her father to go into a place of greater safety, below the water-line of .the ship--as it was likely that shot would soon be flying, and they would be in quite a much danger, or even more, from splinter, in the cabi, as if they were on deok.   "Will npt thy young secretary attend us?" asked Miriam, who had-to the appar- i ent discomfort of young Constant-evinced c a very great interest in his welfare, from the hour of her conference with Coraline, off the i coast of Wales. "He is too young and deli- ] oate to take part in a battle!"  "No, lady-no!" said the youth, almost  fiercely. "Where my master stands, I will  stand by his side!" And, as if he feared some other argument would be used by her to detain hil, the youth, who had been arming himself, hastened from the cabin. "Sir Henry, if thou didst know what I sus- peot, thou wouldst w'der thy secretary to a place of safety, as thou hast myself,' said Miriam. "Pray tell me what thou dost suspect, fair lady. "The Spanish ships have taken the alarm, noble Admiral, and are hauling their wind!" cried the first officer, appearing at tno cabin door. "Excuse me, lady," said Morgan, ".my duty calls me to the deck. I will hear thy ex- planation after we have chased and eaptured these Dons. I will send a person to conduct thee and thy father to safe quarters!" And the young knight hastened to the deck, where he found thOA his vessel was crowding all sail in chase of the Spaniards.  What can have so terrified these pons?" asked the young knight of hie chief lieuten- ant. "I know iot, without it be that flag!" said the officer, pointing to the symbolic banner at the foremast-head. "But tUey cannot es- cape us. We can run two fathomp bo their one. But they carry heavy metal, aid may give us a taste of its quality before they lower their colors."  "Let it come! We must lay them aboard, and carry them as soon as we can; for, at long shot, they'll do us some hurt in spars and hull, and we may so damage them that it will be hard to carry them into por,t, as I desire."  Morgan now remained on deck, closely watching the flying Spaniarcs, and noting how his own vessels clove the waters. t e ocean, which had been deeply, beautify blue, while they were Orossing the Gulf stream, had now assumed a pali h grep, showing that they were on soaquings; in truth, that not more thia] seven or qight fathoms intervened between their keels and the rooks beneaeh. "Had we not better gie them a shot, most noble admiral, to eall their, attention, to the necessity of heaving to t" 'aked his chief lieutenant.   "Not yet-not until we are close aboard-, for twoud lessen our speed to veer from our course," replied the knight. And with the breeze freshening, and the sea raising, as the water shoaled, with the ir- regular pitch. of the " ground swell," the ves- sels dashed on, every sail set to draw to the best advantage. The Spaniards, for a tin'e, crowded on every sail which their spars would bear;,but finding, at last, that there was no possibility of escaping from their fleeter pur. suers, they suddenly handed every sail but their jibs, spencer, and three topsails, and laid up by tie wind close together, evidently intending to fight, by their stripping thus to merely working canvas. "TThat looks well - the Dons have some spirit, and intend to amuse us a little while before they yield!" said Morgan, with a smile to his first officer. "Have thy aail-trimmers ready to take in our canvas, and then see all clear for boarding them in the smoke of their own guns, which, as they are to windward, will soonlhide us and our motions from them." '"Shall we not return shot for shot, good admiral?" "N o-s-ave the powder!  Let cold steel teach them that Britons like to look their foe- men in the eye 1" The officer bowed, and went forward to see that the men were at their stations. "Is not this scene grand, my lad?" asked iMorgan of Constant. "It is, most noble master. The sea seems to roll and toss, as if with a fore-knowledge that its foam will soon be reddened with the orimeon tide of life!" said the boy, with enthusiasm. And then, with a faint shudder, and a tlremor in his voice, he added: "It nim t ', fearful, when men meet hand to hand inle h  tisrce atruggle for mastery-oh, very fearrfair" "If thou dost think so, and feelest the least fear, thousbholldst do as I erstwhile ad- yised thpe-r goo below to a place of safety. For should thy cheek pale, and thy courage leave thee in the hour of conflict, thy cx- ea'ple would not onty injure thee forever with my crew, but perhaps make others less bold than thee." "Thou kno*est me not, my masrer. If thou seest me falter in the strife, I only pray thee to strike me dead at thy feet!" said Con- stant, more firmly.  " i Well, bear thee up, my boy, As best thou canst- but do not expose thyself without cause." ithe aAmiral's attention was now'attracted by the hail of Brodely, who, having run his hip clo0se up under the lee of the admiral, asked ifr his plan of attack. We will lay them both aboard, and oarry *nd   them at the sword's point as soon as we can, after they open fire, my good Brodely," re- plied Morgan. "Steer thou for the lesser ship, which lieth to the westward, and I will steer for the other. Their smoke will hide us; but we will steer for them by compass, as they are laid to." While Morgan was speaking, his vessel and the other had neared the Spaniards, till they were within little over a mile; and the latter, without waiting for further evidence of hos- tility than the flags they wore, opened each a broadside upon Morgan's vessel. "Now, by Saint George, I like that!" cried Morgan, cheerfully. "They have opened fire ere we have given the least provocation, like bloody, cowardly pirates as they arel Fire not a gun, my men; but give them three hearty, English cheers, and look to cutlasses, boarding-pikes, and battle-axes-for I wot there will be plenty of use for them soon!" The crews of both vessels rent the air with eheers, which surged wildly across the brief space of water which now intervened between them and the Spaniards. The latter now fired broadside after broad- side, as if the sound of their guns would ter- rify their foes; for their shot flew far wide of the mark-not one touching, as yet, either vessel. Being to windward, their smoke rolled down in such a heavy cloud toward the English, that their vessels were-complete- ly hidden from their view. And now, for a moment, while the English are calmly and stealthily creeping up through that sulphureous bank of darkness, we will glance at a scene on the deck of the larger galleon; because there is, at least, one char- acter there which yet will deeply interest the reader, and call for the most tender sym- pathy. CHAPTER XXXVII. She was a lady, a daughter of sunny Castile, and superbly beautiful. Her form, not so delicate as that of Coraline, or of sweet Mir- iam, was full and voluptuous-such as would waken the wildest passions in a sensual na- ture. Her full, ripe lips seemed made to speak of love in kisses and in words; her l great, dark eyes were full of soft and liquid light; her glossy tresses, dark as her eyes. hung in. curling masses down over her fair  shoulders and full, heaving bosom. - And in all her beauty, heightened by her terror rather than lessened, the Seiora Anita Farrago clung to her young husband on that deck. They had been married but a few weeks before, in Panama, and were now mak- tng their bridal voyage toward Castile, which land she had left with her parents in her early childhood.   "O my beloved Enrico!" she sobbed, as she lay on his breast, " what will become of us, if those piratical English should over- power and capture us?" "It is impossible. Our ships are larger than theirs, better manned, and better arm- ed! They cannot capture us. Speak I not the truth, worthy Captain Domingo?" The last words were addressed to the cap- tFin of the galleon, who stood so near them that he could not avoid hearing their words. "Undoubtedly, Senor Farrago-utndoubt- edly!" replied the captain. "They do not dare to fire a shotin return to our broadsides, and are undoubtedly creeping away under cover of our smoke. It was my will and wish to chastise them terribly, but I fear they will , escape me!" Having thus pompously delivered himself, the captain took a cigr from his case, made from the newly-discovered American weed, and lighted it by the aid of a gun-matchi which burned close at hand. "Do not these English fight like merciless lions?" asked the lady, tearfully. "' No, Senora--no! They are the most ar- rant cpwards in the world-great- boasters. yet sneaking cowards for all that. Witness that they return not our fire!" "Miseracordia!" screamed the lady. "Look there!" And with her jeweled hand, she pointed to the smoke-cloud just to leeward, where could be seen slowly, but steadily, moving up to- ward them the black, sharp hulls and lofty spars of the ships of Morgan. "Dios meguarde!" cried the captain, "The devils are coming, indeed. I will go below, and prepare to blow up the ship at the last ex- tremity! Let my chief officer take charge of the deck-I will be found in the magazine!" Seeing the captain rushing below, most of his crew followed his example, going not to the magazine of powder-for he went not there- but to the epirit-room, there to prepare them- selves for captivity as speedily as possible. Don Enrico Farrago and his wife were the sole passengers. He was not deficient in cour- age; but when he saw that the deck was ut- terly deserted, he would ha-e carried his wife below. But she had fainted; and before he could bear her to the cabin, the English, eh ering and shouting like madmen, led by Morgan in person, leaped, sword in hand upon the deck of the galleon. Holding her with his left arm, Don Enrico drew his sword and attempted to defend himself, but a single blow from the heavy toledo of Sir Henry shattered his light rapier, and he was defence- less; or, at least, he seemed to be, for the young knight lowered his point, and cried: "Yield thee, man-yield thee, or thou di- est!"   "Not until I have ridden the world of thee, base pirate!" cried the Spaniard. And drop- ping his wife in the doorway of the cabin, he bounded with a tiger-like spring to Morgan, and clasping one ar around his neck, struck a poniard with all I is might at the back of the utterly-sqlrprised night. Had not Con- stant. with the quickness--f thought, caught the descending aran, Sir Henry's days had then b,.en numbered. As it was, the, point of the weapon reached the skin and slightly punctured it. "Back, thou Spanish hound!" cried the admiral, and he dashed the Spaniard so rough- ly from him, that he fell stunned and sense- less against th'e doorway of thie cabin. 1"Thy arm did good service, Constant! I shall not forget thee," said Morgan, as he looked around and saw who had saved him from the blow so well aimed at his life. Then, looking forward, he discovered the lovely wife of the Spaniard, and uttered an exclamation of pleased surprise. "By St. George! there is a prize that a Sultan mi,ht joy to claim. Never saw I a more lovely woman!" The object of his praise opened her eves; and though her cheek was deathly pale, there was iiore than an earthly beauty in her frightened, imploring glance. A new and wild desire seemed to take pos- session of the knight. For the instant, he for- got his plighted troth to Coraline, and nio- tioning to a couple of his men near by, he said : "Bear that lovely creature in safety to my private cabin, and guard her there!" She heard his words, and her glance at the same instant falling upon the forin of her hus- band, which still lay stunned and bleeding where Morgan had cast it, she threw hvrself, with a wild shriek, upon it, and fainted. It was therefore an easy task for his follow- ers to obey their commander's orders. Morgan now gave orders to search the ship, to show no quarter to those who resisted, but to bring all who yielded, bound, to the deck; also, to especially look for the captain, that from his lips he might learn the value and nature of his cargo. While these orders were being obeyed, the admiral glanced toward the other galleon, which, commanded by a brave man, was mak- ing a very fair defence, and giving Brodely his hands full of work. The flash of small- arms, and the gleaming of clashing steel amid the smoky'canopy above thte vessel's deck, told that the struggle there was sharp and bloody. He smiled grimly, as he noticed this, and said: "Brodely is in better luck than me. He has to fight for his earnings."   "Shall we not lower a boat or two, and send him aid, Sir Henry?" asked his offi- cer. "No!" replied the knight. "Let him work out his own salvation. We can then see what kind of stuff ie is made of." At this moment, some of the men drangcd up the cowardly captain of the galleon, who threw himself upon his knees before the ad- miral, as he heard hisuink proclaimed, and begged that his life might be spared. "' Tis hardly worth the taking!" said Sir Henry, conteuptuously. "'Answer truly my questions, and thou mayest have thy life-re- fuse, or answer with one falseh,od, and 1 will hang thee by the heels at the bowsprit end, and let tihe salt surges wash thy sins away! What treasure hast thou on board?' "( Fifty thousand pieces of eight, great ad- miral! Also some silver in bars, destined for the great cathedral in Seville, to be cast in im- ages of the holy saints!" "Images of the devil! Why, ye godless wretches, would ye make graven images in express tlfiance of God's commandment? I shall make better use of thy silver, and all else that I find aboard! What passengers ha4t thou, and what wealth have they?" "We have but two. Don Enrico F'arrago, who lieth yonder, and his wife, a most conie- ly lady. I wot not where she is?" "Where is Anita-where is my wife?" ask- ed Farrago, wildly, as he raised his bleeding head from the fdeck. "Villain! what hast thou done with my wife?" "Oh, speak softly, Don Enrico! Thou art addressing the admiral!" cried the terror- stricken captain. "I care not whether he be an admiral or king--he is a false villain; and if he hath done aught of wrong to my poor wife, I will, unarmed, rend his life away with my nails and teeth!" And the more than half-crazed husband staggered to his feet, and attempted again to spring upon Morgan. But he was instantly seized and bound. and at a sign from Morgan, hurried away to a place of security. "I Hath he wealth on board?" asked Mor- gan of the captain. "I know not how much, good lord admiral; yet his bride hath a vast store of jewels, and he is reliputed to be very wealthy." "We will soon see," said Morgan. Then, turning to an officer, he said: "Let all the gold& and silver, and jewels that can be found be taken on board my ship. Then, with thirty men of my crew, take charge of this galleon and the prisoners, and follow closely in my wake, as I steer for Ja- maica." While yet the younmgadmiral was speaking, three rousing cheers, -lreaking from the crew   of Brodely's ship, gave token that their vic- tory was complete; and soon a boat from the lesser galleon, with Brodely in it, came to announce his success, and also the amount of wealth on board, which was but little less than that in the large galleon. Morgan gave his vice-admiral orders to put a prize-crew on board of his galleon, and to follow him into Kingston, Jamaica, keep- ing close with his prize, so as to prevent all chance of her recapture.  This order given, and the silver pnd other treasure safely removed to the " )Demon of the Sea," Morgan followed it; and at once, ere he entered his cabin, gave orders for all sail to be set, and also laid a course for tle helnsman, which, if followed according lo his calculation, would land him on the island of Jamaica within four-and-tw&hty hours, if the breeze held good. Hlaving seen all four vessels bowling along on their course, he bethlought him of his lovely prisoner, and went to visit her. CHAPTER XXXVIII. When Sir Heliry. bethinking him of his fair captive, descended to his private cabin to look upon her, he found her, not under guard and safe from intrusive eyes, as he had expected, but weeping and sobbing in the main cabin, with the fair Jewess by her side, striving to console her. "How is this, ye knaves!" he cried, an- grilv, to the two men whom he had charged with the care of his captive. "Were ye deaf, that ye heard not my orders, or have ye willfiull disobeyed them?" We could not deal with her, most noble admiral, without using great force-for see- ing yonder lady, thy passenger, she broke from our grasp, and casting herself at her feet, so clasped her that we could not remove her." "And I bade them not to attempt it, Sir Henry," said Miriam; "for I knew that it- was not in thy noble nature to oppress a captive, much less when that paptive was a woman!"  "Thou wert right. I did not wish the lady harmed; but she must be kept in safety un- til she is ransomed," said the knight, check- ing all outward signs of the angemr and dis- appointment which buraed within him. "I will leavp her to thy care." And *he admiral turned upon his heel to go on deck again. But the captive lady rose, and casting her- self in tearful beauty at his feet, spoke to him in the most pitiful tones, in her native language, which he did not understand. "What saith she?" he asked of the Jewess, whom he knew to be well versed in many languages.   "She prays thee to tell her whether her husband lives; and if so, to bring him to her, for the love and mercy of the holy God!" re- plied Miriam. "Alas!" answered Morgan, with well-dis- semnibled sorrow; "he resisted too bravely, and refusing quarter, fell beneath the swords of my men! So tell the lady, and comfort her as best thou canst." And the knight turned hastily away to con- ceal the blush' which his falsehooil forced upon his cheek. And lie blushed deeper still --for he met Constant face to face, and knew that the boy had heard him utter the cruel untruth. "(Go on deck, sirrah! Why art thou ever lurking at my heels," le said, angrily. A flush of indignant anger suffused the countenance of the youth ; but it passed in an instant, annl a gush of tears rose to his eyes, as he turned and obeyed the order. "I dil not mean to be harsh with thee, my boy," said Sir Henry, as he followed Constant' to the deck. "But that intermeddling Jew- ess put me out of temper. Seeing that I have wounded thy feelings, I regret it." "Most noble' master, thou art too conde- scending to notice my grief! I strive ever to please thee." "And thou dost succeed, my boy. I shall not forget that thou didst save my life to-day. Dry thy tears, and consider thyself doubly dear to me now." "Thanks, dear master  Thanks!" and the youth imprinted a hot kiss upon the hand of the knight, which he had grasped. Malak, who had been retained, for his fidel- ity, as his mastet's body-servant, stood near, and frowned darkly as he noticed this impas- sioned action. H-e had never shown any lik- ing for'the strange youth; and, since a brief word had been spoken to him by the Lady Coraline, when she visited the ship, he had kept a close surveillance over every action of the boy; yet so cautiously, that the latter did not apparently observe it. CHAPTER XXXIX. "Land, ho!" This was the shout from the maet-headed look-out on M'organ's ship, on the second morning after he had captured the Spanish galleons. "Whither away, my man?" asked the ad- miral, who had, for an hour or more, been pacing the after-deck, with his eyes east down, as if he was in a deep study. "Dead ahead, air!" replied the man. "Low by the sea-side, and high mountains back."             I "Our reckoning is right I Itiae Jamaical" said the admiral to his first officer. "SOt our gayest colors--signal to the fleet to do   tho same, and prepare to fire a royal salute when we enter the harbor. I shall need re- cruits; and the more show we make, the plen- tier they will be." The admiral continued his walk, while his officers and crew were busy in preparing the ship for a showy entrance into port. "I shall soon have this meddling Jewess out of my way," muttered the admiral, as he paced to and fro. "It would have been more seemly for her not to have crossed me in my pleasure, after I had ru nlered her and her father such great service. But it matters not-pnssion burns all the fiercer for delay. When Miriam and her sire are once on shore, the haughty pride of the lovely Spaniard shall come down, or I am not the master here. She shall pay dearly for her undisguised ha- tred of him who hath her in his power. She will, doubtless, ask- to be put on shore with them; but there shall be a no to that I My prisoners are all mine own, to deal with as I choose. Ha! what means that? A shout from the forecastle of yonder galleon, and a cry of joy from mine own cabin window! It is the Spanish husband, who has recognized his wife; and she, by her answering cry, hath told him that she lives. By the foul fiend, the guard on board that galleon shall rue the hour when they permitted that captive to reach the forecastle. Ha by Saint George, the madman leaps into the sea to strive to swim hither I She shrieks again! I must to the cabin to still her cries. Here, Malak- come to the cabin with me quickly." The knight hurried below, where he found both the Spanish lady and Miriam at the cabin window, watching the Spaniard, who, with superhuman exertions, was striving to swim from the galleon to the ship. But he was in deadly peril, not alone from the surging waves, but from shots fired from the galleon by the guard, whose vigilance he had escaped. One of these evidently struck him-for, suddenly, the foam through which he breasted, in the wake of the ship, was erimsoned with his blood, and he disappeared beneath the waters. With a wild shriek of agony, his wretched wife strove to cast herself through the cabin window; and would have succeeded, had not Sir Henry, at the instant, reached and with- drawn her form from its fearful peril. With a wild scream of terror she struggled for an instant in his arms, and then faited into utter insensibility. "Take her to her state-room, and on thy life let her not leave it," said the knight to Malak. "Lady " said he, sternly, to Miriam, "it seems to me that thou hast taken sides with my prisoner, to annoy me 1"   "I have pitied her, Sir Henry-wherefore should that annoy thee '" "If I had left thee to thy fate, in London, thou wouldst now have needed pity for thyself. But thou art safe, and within a few hours will stand with thy sire, free, on the shores of Janmaica: and then we part forever." "Forever, Sir Henry? And that. too, while thou art angry with a poor maiden, who would yield her life to save thine, or render thee blessed! Thou hast indeed saved me from a terrible fate, Sir Henry, yet I could have saved myself, withoutlosing that which once was mine-thy fiienldship.' "Saved thyself? How, I would fain learn?" "By sacrificing a life that is worthless without honor; dreary without friendship; dark-very dark in its cheerless gloom, now." The nlourftful tone in which these word's were uttered- the choking sobs which follow- ed, and the great tears which welled out from her dark eyes, touched the heart of Sir Henry, and taking her hand, he said : "Pardon me, sweet Miriam! I have wrong- ed thee. I was angry without reason, and a dark thought was in my heart. For thy salle I will banish the thought, and my anger shall go with it!" "Oh, bless thee, Sir Henry! Thy noble nature hath returned," cried the Jewess; ard she kissed his hands with fervor. "And see!" she added, "a boat from the galleon hath rea- cued the Spaniard. Oh! do not let him he further injured-let his wounds be seen to, and restore him to his poor wife! Her heart is breaking! Do it, Sir Henry, and the bless- ing of Heaven will attend thee!" "And if I do it not?" "Thine own brave heart will reproach thee for oppressing the helpless." "Thou pleadest wel, fair iiam. If they give raivom, which is due to the king and my crew, they shall be released, and permitted to go whithersoever it pleaseth them to go." "Right gladly will they do that, if it is in their power; and if it be not, I have jewels which I wouA cheerfully give, to see them free and hapl : for there is no wrong so deep, no wretchedness so great, a& the separation of two wedded hearts." "Thou dost speak, sweet Miriam, like one who hath felt the power of love." "I would, that I, never had!" sighed the Jewess; and she turned away, for her face was crimsoned with blushes. "Some time agone, thou didst say thou hadst a secret to reveal to me," said the knight, either not noticing her confusion, or else not appearing to. "I did, Sir Henry! When the lady to whom thou art betrothed visited this ship, her quick eyes discovered that the youth   who acts as thy secretary, and who seems attached to thy person, was not what she as- sumed to be l" She, lady! Thou dost not mean that Constant is of thy sex?" "I do, Sir Knight; and that she is none other than Lady Helen of Caermarthen, whose devotion for thee hath induced her to unsex herself in apparel, and to follow thee through all peril. I had not revealed this to thee, but for her own sake, that thou mayest shield her from new dangers. And I did make a promise to thy betrothed, that ere I heft ship- board, so as to be beyond sight of, her, that I would reveal to theethe discovery we made!" "Thou dost astound me, lady Yet, now that I bethink me, there are a thousand things which seem to strengthen thy conjecture. The actions of the beardless youth-his blushes! Yet the Lady Helen was very fair-Constant is dark!" "'Tis an easy task, Sir Henry, to stain one's complexion." "True, kind Miriam, most true. But I will soon learn whether it be so or not. Wilt thou be so kind as to place a complete change of female apparel in the state-rootwhich I as. signed to the youth. I will go on deck, and bid him prepare for our entrance into port; and say that I have caused a new and fitting suit to be placed in his room. When he seeth it, he will be aware that the secret is discover- ed, if indeed, Constant and Lady Helen are one!" "I will do as thou desirest, Sir Henry. And now, may I go and speak words of hope and consolation to the poor Spanish lady-tell her that her husband lives, and shall be restored to her?" "Yes, lady, on conditions-her ransom and his must be paid." "I will be guarantee for that, good knight!" "Thou wilt favor me by preparing the gar- ments at once," said Sir Henry. And he hastened on deck, muttering as he went: t "The fend is in the fair Jewess. She is bound to eircumvenk my design on the lovely Spaniard, but we will see-we will see!" CHAPTEB XL. Constant was standing by the taffrail, look- ing gloomily over the stern at the bubbling water in the wake of the ship, when Sir Henry went on deck. He raised his head, and looked around with a kind of gloomy smile as the admiral approached him. "Wert thinking of thy home in far-distant Wales, good Constant?'" "No, my master, but of the devotion Aieh induced that brave Spaniard to risk his life to reach$ he side of her whom he loved."   "Love works wonders, trulyl" said the knight, eyeing Constant closely. Hast thou ever been in love!" "Ay, good master, and hopelessly I Had I not been, I had not fled from my native land, to brave the perils of the sea." "'Twas not brave in thee to leave the lady of thy love for others, perchance,to win, while thou art far away." "The lady of my love will win no other heart but mine." "Thou knowest not I But thy heart may not withstand the test of absence. But a truce to this nonsense. Seriously, dost thou not regret that thou hast left Wales behind thee?" "Hath aught in my deportment caused that question, good master?" "Thou answerest my question by asking another. Reply first to me, and then I will consider thy question!" "I am not sorry that I left Wales then, my master. My reply is direct." "And to the point. Now, another query: I shall need a messenger to the king, to bear to him a 'hare of the wealth which I have taken in these galleons Wilt thou be that messenger? 'Twill give thee a chance to see thy lady-love, and mark what change thy' absence hath produced." "O good master, do not send me as thy messenger I I do not wish to leave thy side; I am young, and my arm is not yet strong for' the battle, but experience will improve me, and I shall be of service to thee. Choose some other messenger, I pray thee." "I know not whom to trust. Besides, Ihave a special message to send to thy fair cousin, at Caermarthen Castle." "What message hast thou for her, my noble master?" cried the youth, eagerly. "I cannot give it to thee, unless theu wilt be my messenger." "I would be thy messenger, good master, t it was to bear hope to the heart of my poor cousin, who, to my knowledge, loveth thee be- yond all else on earth 1" said the youth, trembling with nervous excitement. "Thou hast heard me %ay that I am betroth- ed to another. Therefore, if, as thou sayeet, thy cousin loves me, I could send no message of hope to her. I respect her, and would wish her every joy and pleasure under her father'sa care and protection, until some nobler man, than I should cross her path, and win the heart which, in my obscurity, I onoe wer', shiped, and sought for in vain." The knight petended not to notice the great agitation and confusion of Constant; but, looking shoreward, continued: "We are approaching our port rapidly, good Constant, As I shall land and visit the- governor immediately, accompanied by th:   Jew and his daughter, thou, too, shalt be of the eompany, if thou wilt. And that thou mayest be well and rightly appareled, I have caused a new suit of garments to be sent to thy room. If they suit thee, put them on, and wear them for my sake, and thine own!" The youth, not noticing the emphasis of his words, bowed, and went down to the cabin. The knight remained for a long time on deck, waiting the return of Constant; but the youth did not come. He therefore went to lok for him in th'e atin. Cautiously approaching the door of the state-room which had been assigned to the youth, he heard the latter sobbing bitterly; and knew, from .the incoherent words which now and then broke 'Out between the sobs, that the conjecture of Miriam was right. It was indeed Helen of Caermarthen, who had thus, in disguise, faced peril and hardship to follow him. There could be rqo mistake in those sobs-those words of passionate grief. Without speaking, he retraced his steps to the deck, and attempted to give his attention to the entrance of his vessels into port; but his thoughts would return to the weeping girl who had sacrificed so much for him. CHAPTER XLI. The Tour vessels, under a full press of can- vas, their masts decorated with gay flags, pre- sented a most beautiful appearance, as they stood gallantly in toward the port of Kings- town. As Morgan did not permit the galle- ons to show'other than English colors, and their heavy guns loomed blackly from their port-holes, his fleet looked exceedingly war- like and menacing. No wonder, therefore, that Sir Simon Mans- field, the governor of the island, who had been looking at them for some time through his spy-glass, should order his artillerists to stand by their guns in the fort; for there had been rumors of rar being in expectance both with the French and Spanish, and he Was an old soldier, and knew that, oftentimes, to cover evil designs, ships sailed under false colors. But when the ships-the leading one hay- ing been boarded by the king's pilot-round- edto in the usual anehorage, and, whileqrl- ing their sails, fired a royal salute, he or ered the salute retuethd, and told his captMan of the port to take his barge and learn what ships they were; and to invite the admiral of the fleet to visit him :t hs earliest conveni- ence. But ere the officer could' haRe his barge manned, a boat was lowered from Sir Henry Morgan's ship; and that knight, dressed in his rialest uniform, and accompanied by the Jew, Solomon, also clad richly, and his fair daugh- ter, entered it; and its sturdy crew rowed him   rapidly toward the pier used as a landing. place. The governor, standing on his dignity, re- treated to the government house, leaving his port-captain to receive the visitors, for Sir Simon was a very proud and punctilious man, who felt his authority, anrcoInsidered himself second only to the king. A large crowd of citizens, of various shades of color, and seveial nationalities, crowded down to the pier, attracted by curiosity to see the strangers. The captain of the port had some difficulty, with his guard, to keep these back, so as to leave room enough for the party of Sir Henry lo land. When the boat of the latter reached the pier, the knight at once leaped from it to the shore, and, answering the salute of the port-captain with an easy grace, asked him where the governor of the island was to be found?: "He hath lut this niompnt retired to the government house, to prepare fittingly to re- ceive visitors of such rank and importance as thy appearance, Sir Knight, indicates. If it please thie to reveal thy name and rank, I will speedily send a messenger ,to announce them, and attend thee, with an escort, into the governor's presence." "I care not for an escort," said the knight, carelessly. "Thou mayest send him word that Admiral Sir Henry Morgan, accompa- nieI by a fiscal agent of the king, will visit hirprresently. And thou mayesl' say to these good people, who stand with their mouths agape, that I come to these seas to chastise the ,freebooting Spaniards, who have so wronged our people, on the Main and in the Carribean Seas. Also, thai volunteers of ships, and men who wish to sail beneath m flag, and win prize-money enough to enricT them for life, will find acceptance at mry hands. Yonder floats two galleons which I captured but a few hours agone!" Having thus delivered himself. the knight conrteously offered his arm to Miritn, and escorted her toward the government house,  followed by her father and the captin of the port, while the crowd, wit loud chees, formed a most imposing body-guard. "Send these people to the nearest inns, and let them drink success to my enterprise!" said Morgan toMalak, who, as ever, was close at hand. I do not want such t medley escort!" And he tossed a purse of gold to the faith- ful black, with which to carry out his orders. "o What dost thou think Lady Helen will do, now that she knows that her identity is dis- covered?" asked the Jewess of the knight, as she leaned upon his arm. "I know not, in trifh; nor can I imagine ' replied the knight. "Though I spoke to her with gentle kindness, and called her by name ere 1 left the ship, she would not opel her   door to me; nor yet reply, except by sobs, which she seemed to try to suppress. I thought 'twere best to let her weep herself to calmness, while I made my call upon the gov- ernor; and then she may be prepared to listen to my advice, and be willing to return in all haste and honor to her home, in one of the galleons which I shall fit out, and send, with his share of prize-money, as a present to the king!" "Thy plan is alike kind and honorable; and, O good Sir Henry! blame not my pre- sumption; but I pray thee not to forget thy promise touching the fair Spaniard and her husband!" ' I will not, gentle Miriam; for thy sake, both of them shall go free, and be welcome to re- turn to their homes in the best way they can." CHAPTER XLII. I said, in the previous chapter, that Sir Bimon Mansfield felt himself, as Governor of Jamaica, to be, morally and officially, a very great nlan. Physically speaking, he was also a great man. In weight, he bordered on three hun- dred pounds, and, like a novel of the French school, was quite as broad as he was long- His appearance was decidedly Fallataffian. He wore a full-bottomed wig, a sword consid- erably longer than himself (which, hanging by the belt-straps, dangled far in his rear, as he waddled along); and a small cocked-hat, sitting on the top of his head, had its peak brought fiercely down over his left eye, to indicate hi soldier-like nature. His broad sword-belt seemed really necessary to support the frontal obesity of his body, and the golden-headed sane, which he carried as a kind of staff of office, also seemed to be required as a support to his unwieldy frame. When the messenger of his port-captain an- nounced the admiral, who was a knight, and, also, a fiscal agent of the king-an office which he did not precisely comprehend-the governor was at some loss as to the manner in which he conid best receive them, so as to do them proper honor, and also to preserve his own superior dignity. Hearing that they were coming directly to him, without stand- ing upon ceremony, he-mounted a chair upon a platform-which he had caused to be erect- ed as a kind of gubernatorial throne-in the great hall of the government house, and caused some two dozen of half-armed and mixed-colored soldiers to form in line, on either hand, as a guard.  e Thus seated, with his little cocked-hat on his big head, and his sword sticking out at a right angle from his thigh, the ponderous governor made quite a picture, as in state he awaited his visitors.   In a few moments they entered. Morgan could scarcely refrain from laugh- ing outright at the figure before him ; for the look of dignity which Sir Simon strove to as- sume was so supremely ludicrous, in connec- nection with the rest of his appearance, that it would have made a Quaker grin. The soldiers presented arms, a drummer made a tremorous roll, and the governor, with considerable exertion, rose to his feet as the knight advanced, and was duly presented to him by the captain of the port. "Thou art trirly welcome to our Island of Jamaica, which we govern, under Ilis Royal Majesty, King Charles. Thou art, we repeat, truly welcome, Admiral Sir Henrv Morgan!" said Sir Simon, pompously. "Thanlks, most puissant governor 1" said Sir Henry, bowing with great gravity. "Per- mit me to introduce to thing especial notice my friend, Solomons, who will reside here, acting as fiscal agent for the king, to receive such moneys as may fall to the king's share from the prizes which I may capture from the freebooting Spanish. "Why, are we at war with Spain?" asked the astonished governor. "Not with Spain as a kingdom; but I have his majesty's warrant to proceed to all ex- tremities with the Spaniards in these seas, and on the-South American Main, in reprisal for the wrongs they have done his subjects. Thou canst here behold it, signed by the royal hand, and sealed with the royal seal " And Sir Henry unfolded the parchment which he named. 1Hethen added: "I have already begun my work, by cap. turing two rich galleons, which lie at anchol by the side of my own two ships." The governor looked astonished; but re- spectfully kissing the royal warrant which Morgan exhibited, he said: "Touching this fiscal agency of which thou speakest- is it not strange that the king should appoint other than myself? Hitherto all the government funds have been collected by me!" "Thou hadst better question the king there- on!" said Morgan, dryly. "My friend, Solo- mons, hath his commission in his pocket, duly signed and sealed; and I must request of thee to appoint fitting quarters for himself and his fair daughter, that I may send his baggage in safety thereto; for I must speed me on my vengeful mission as quickly as I can 1" The governor did not like the haughty and almost commanding tone now assumed by Sir Henry; but the evidence of the king's favor which the latter bore overcWe him, and, de- scending from his position of state, he said: "We will attend to the matter speedily, Sir Henry. Meantime, permit me to offer the courtesies of my house to thyself and friends,   as guests. Be so kind as to follow me, and I will order refreshments, in haste!" And the governor waddled off before the knight and his companions, with an exceeding- ly red, and somewhat troubled countenance. CHAPTER XLIII. From a small sky-light in her state-room, Helen of Caermarthen saw Sir Henry Morgan and his companions leave the ship and row Oto the shore. She had not changed her mas- culine garb for that which the Jewess had ar- ranged for her, though it was faultlessly ele- gant, and exceedingly rich in material. When she saw the knight and his compan- ions leave the vessel, she ceased to sob; and while she dried her tears, she muttered, in a tone of impassioned bitterness : "He scorns my love; cares not that, for his sake, I have unsexed myself in garb and eharacter-left luxury and comfort to share his perils, and endure hardship and suffering. It is enough. le shall learn to fear a woman's scorn. And the hated Jewess who, doubtless, discovered my secret unto him, shall feel a wronged woman's vengeance. I 'must leave this ship. Jewels and gold'I have good store of, and shall need them now, for through dis- uise and treachery I must work my ends. have loved thee, Henry Morgan, as woman never loved before' I know not my nature, if I do not now hate thee as well." The woman paused, and the heat of her an- gry feelings seemed to dry up her tears, as a July sun lic] up the dew which bespreads the morning flowers. "I shall need confederates!" continued she. "And who so fit, if I can effect their escape, as Percival and his man Brompton? Titough I despise, yet will I use them. I will effect their escale ere sleep visits my eyelids, and then use them as my tools. They are despe- rate and wretched, and will obey me. Perci- val will be but too glad to act against the man who hath doubly abased him. I will to the work An unseen interview with them, to prepare them for following events to result in their escape, must be first had. Then I will to the shore in my present guise; which, once there, shall be quickly changed-and I have neither courage nor wit if I succeed not in making Sir Hen ry Morgan feel that he had better not have scorned me, woman though I be!" Looking into a mirror to observe if the grief-stains were washed from her counte- nance by the stong application of spirits which she had been using, the determined girl again muttered; "I will be weak no more! To be strong, I must avoid him until I am able to strike as my   stern will may dictate. I look once more like Constant. To sie Percival and Iprepare him will be but a brief job-then to the officr in charge, to get a boat to take me to the shore with somethng which m' master hath forgot. ten. My plans are formed, and they shall be executed."' Lady Helen, now spurning the garments aside which the Jewess had left for her, care- fully secured sonic valuable jewels about her Iperson, and a considerable quantity of gold -and also secreted a keen dagger withiin the bosori of the tunic which she wore, and a pair of richly-mounted pistols. By her examining the priming of the latter, it could be seen that they were loaded. "I am ready for action!" she said, as she completed these arrangements. "And there is much for me to do. My vengeance cannot rest on him alone. That strange creature who visited us on the coast of Wales-whom I in- tuitively hated on sight--musthe di-covered. There will be no rest for thee, Helen of Caer- marthen, on this-side of the grave." And with a heavy sigh-but with stern de- termination in, her looks-the changed girl left, the state-room to carry out the designs so recently framed in her mind. CHAPTER XLIV. Sir Simon Mansfield, with all of his faults, was not lacking in hospitality, and it was some hours before Sir Henry Morgan could tear himself away from the table and coln pa- ft' of his host. But at last he did so, and re- turned to his ship in order to have the bag- gage belonging to Solomon and his daughter sent on shore--for suitable quarters had been provided for them by the governor, who show- ed the greatest deference to the wishes of the young admiral, after the latter had exhibited to him an autograph letter frdn the king, commanding all of his majesty', officers to forward the enterprises of his tnrty friend and knight, Sir Henry Mborgan, jby every means at their command, failing in which they would-icnur the royal displeasure. For, though the king had appointed a fiscal agent to receive the prize-moiney offered by the young admiral, the offe of governor was yet lucrative, and of an importance not to be dib- regarded; and Sir Simon feared for his plaoe if one who seemed to stand so well at court as Sir Henry should become displeased with hidim. The first thing which occurred to the mind of the knight after he reached his vessel, was to visit the state-room of Lady Helen, to see if She bad become more composed. He found the state-room open, and the garments which had been left by Miriamt east in disarray upon the floor. A note, addressed to himself, lay   upon the table. He opened it. It read as follows:  "Thou hast discovered my secret. Knowift* how I loved thee-how I periled life to follow thee-thou yet didst scorn me and my devotion. I love thee no longer-hate alone fills my heart Beware, hence- forth, of     HELEN OF CAERMARTHEN." "By my life, she putteth on a bold air!" said the knight. "Vet I would rather have her hate than her love, for little ill can she work me. * But I must see whither she hath gone, for by this I should judge that she hath the ship." Upon making inquiry, the knight learned that the youth-- yet supposed by his officers and crew to be none other than what his ap- parel indicated--had left the ship, within an hour or less later than himself, saying that lie was going to the shore to bear to his master a pachkage which the latter had forgotten. The a Imiral expressed no surprise that he had not seen him, and kept his own secret from all except Malak, who, being warned, would, he knew, keep a faithful watch over hinm. For from the moment the black had been sent by Ethelbert to serve him, he had by flight and by day proved the most utter devotion. Having sel(ected all the baggage and trea- sure belonging to the Jew, he-in person- saw it transferred to his boats, and sent Malak il clharge with it to the shore Then, remem- ,cring his promise to Miriam, he sent an offi- ce on board of the galleon to bring the brave Spainiard, Don Enrico Farrago, on 'board his ship. And while the officer was absent on this er- rand, lie paid a visit to the lady in her state- room, wnere she remained, half-dead with anxiety-'yet not quite without hope; for the Jewcss Iad told her of the solemn promise which the knight had made to her. She looked up so tearfully and pitifully in his achee, when lie opened her door, that his better nature was touched; and, forgetting his lawless passion in his pity, the knight spoke to her kindly-not thinking, at the in- stant, that she could not understand his lan- guage. But she seemed to read his feelings in his looks, and she knelt and kissed his hands, and in her own dulcet tongjue murmured alike her thanks and her hiopes. Pointing toward the galleon--which he showed to her through the cabin-window-the knight soon showed her that her husband was approaching, and then he went on deck to re- ceive the Spaniard, whom he respected more for his valor than aught ele. Por brave umen are akin in spirit, even though theiybe foes. The Spaniard spoke some English ; and when Sir Henry received him, and told him that he would find his noble and virtuous wife   in safety below, he knelt; in gratitude, upon the deck, and embraced the knees of his cap- tor, and poured forth, his thanks in words elo- quent from intensity of feeling. Sir Henry, who felt that lie did not deserve these expressions of gratitude when his fornm- er' intentions were self-considered, raised the Castilian from the leck, and bade him hasten below, to see her whom lie so loved-adding, tlnhat from that hour they were free, without further ransom than what they might volun- tarily give to the crew of the ship-which had captured them, and that their baggage should be restored to them, unharmed. Not caring to witness the interview between Don Enrico and his lovely wife, the knight now ordered his barge, and again visited the shore - having promised the governor to share a bottle or two of wine with him, by way of brightening the evening. Ere he wenit, however, lie gave orders that the Span- iard and his wife should be put on shore when they desired; and sent them directifrps by which they could find the residence ff Miri- am, whose plea for them had been so fucccss- fnl.  CHAPTER XLV. It was unfortunate for Sir Henry that he had not spoken to his officers regarding the conduct and absence of the supposed youth, Constant; for he had been but a little time on shore, when the latt r bol'dly returned to the ship, bringing with him two persons, who purported to be soldiers of the governor's guard, and a paper, which lie alleged to be an order from 1 is master for the delivery of Percival anid Brompton to, lirn and the guard. As neither of the officers-though excellent seamen, and good men and true-were able to decipher manuscript, they took t:he word of the youth (whom they only knew as the con- fidential secretary of their commandeir) to be good, and delivered the men without any de- mur-the more eqpccially believing all to be right because th youth insisted upon their being strongly bound. While this ,was being done, Lady Helen descended into the cabin, and wrote another niote to Sir Henry; and while there, also furnished herself, from among his private armory, with weapons-- both daggers- and pistols-for her new con- federates. These she easily concealed beneath the loose tunic which she wore. , Observing the Spaniard and his wife there, she easily learned, from their conversation- as she understo,od their language-that they were free, and, as she knew whither Sir Hen- rv intended to sail as soon as his crews were recruited and refreshed, a bold and original plan to thwart his aims at once crossed-her mind. "Seaor," said she, addressing Farrago, ' if   thou wilt swear upon the Holy Cross not to betray me, I will save thee from a fearful peril-ay, save thee, and obtain means to land thee safely at the port from whence thou didst lately sail, and which soon will be visit- ed by Sir Henry Morgan, with his forces, pre-, pared to pillage, slay, burn, and destroy!" '* What meanest thou, fair youth? The no- ble knight hath declared that we shall be freel" replied Farrago. '"He meaneth it not, noble Spaniard. His sensual eye hath fallen on thy lovely wife, and he is not one to give up his prey so easily. He intendeth to deceive theef Swear that thou wilt not betray me, and I will tell thee all, which, as his'secretary, I havetlearned! Seeing his deceit and cruel treachery, I am myself about to fly from his power!" "I swear not to betray thee!" said the Spaniard, reverently kissing a crucifix which was cuspended from the neck of his wife. "And now tell me what thou knowest, and what thou canst do to save us!" "I know that when thou thinkest thyself safe on the shore, he intenw!s to have thee privately assassinated, that thou wilt be out of his way, and thy wife defenceless. It could be better done there than here. To save thee, if thou wilt aid me with means to purchase and man a small vessel, I will go myself with thee to thy home, and We will warn all the Spaniards of those coasts of his intended de- scent, and cause them to keep their ships in port, and their forts and towLs ready to meet his attacks!" "Thou dost speak like one who is wise and truthful. I will trust thee, and provide thee with such means as I may. But I go to the shore within the hour. How may I meet thee there?" "I will find the means. Intrust me with the seal-ring on thy finger. When thou seest it, follow the bearer until he doth lead thee to me; and'be cautious, by no act or word to betray our intentions!" "I will not, fair stranger. f thou dost succeed in bearing me and mine back to our home, thy fortune is made. Doubt not our gratitude, or our liberality!" "I work not for gold!" "And yet thou art English! I thought gold was the god which they worshiped!" Helen paused not to reply to this rather sarcastic bit of candor. CHAPTER XLVI. At was wearing on in the evening when Sir Henry, rather top-heavy, from the effects of Sir Simon Mansfield's hospitality, walked down toward the pier, where his boat awaited him. The governor had greater capacity of stowage than himself, and also had a habit of   t topping his wine oif with repeated goblets of I rum-punch-which beverage was rather too r stro*g for one unused to it; and the young admiral found himself necessitated to derive - support from the strong and steady arm of -( Malak, as also guidance; for the night was excessively dark, and the port-ward streets of Kingston were not lighted in Nise days, when gas was not known, and oil was exceedingly scarce. , They had nearly reached the water-side, when  alak--who had paused to listen for the dash of waves to indicate his vicinity to them, became aware that some persons were advancing toward them from the front. "Who cometh before us? Malak? Bid them stand clear!" cried the half-tipsy knight, whose ears caught the sound., "Ah!-his voice! By the Holy Rood! but he shall rue this meeting!" cried one of the persons in front. "Hold-hold! or thboi wilt ruin all, rash fool!" cried a shrill voice, which almost so- bered Sir Henry; for he plainly recognized the tones of his ci-devant secretary. At the same instant there was a flash, which lighted up for the space of half a second the faces of three or four individuals-the report of a pistol; and Sir Henry felt a scalding sensation along his left side, which told him that he was wounded. "Fly, fool-fly! or our lives are not worth the purchase, cried the same shrill voice. And the sound of rustling feet was heard an instant; and then all was still. "Art thou hurt, my masterg" asKed'Ma- lak, anxiously. "Merely grazed, I thini. But didst thou note who it was that fired the pistol?" "By the flash, good master, I took it to oo the dastardly Lord Percival!' "Thou wert right, Malak. I recognized his voice ere I saw his f;ce. He hath escaped in some way. We must aboard, to inquire into this matter. That she-fiend is linked with him, it seems, and will go any length to prove her hate. We must get a guard, and have the town and whole island searched, if it be necessary, for their arrest. Their cool at- tempt at assassination must be punished!" "Thou art bleeding, my master!" "Not much! A little blooa-letting will do me good, and cool my brain-rendered all too hot with many potations, good lMalak. But we will on board, with all speed! Ho the boat-the boat!" "Ay, ay, most noble admiral!" cried his coxswain; who, with the boat's crew had been aroused by the sound of the pistol-shot. " Have ye seen any boat in the act if land- ing here lately?" asked Sir Henry, as he stepped into his barge.   "We have not, noble sir," replied the cox- swain. "But, to tell the truth, one might have landed, for weary and warm, we slept on ourthwarts until aroused but an instant agone by the sound of a shot" The admiral asked no further questions, but bade them row speedily aboard, for he felt that considerable blood was ebbing away from lis wound. "Where are the prisoners or slaves, Per- cival and Brompton?" asked Sir Henry of his chief officer when he reached the vessel. "They were sent to thee, at thine order, brought by thy secretary, who came with the governor's guard! Thy written order, which I hold here as a guarrantee for their de- livery!" And the officer exhibited an order purport- ing to have been written by the knight, but evidently the work of the cunning secretary. "Thou hast been deceived: but 'twas no fault of thine, good Hubert," said the admiral. "Attend me in my cabin within a half-hour. We have a dangerous foe to guard against, who will work us evil if We be not on our guard!" And with this the knight went below to have his wound dressed. While Malak was searching for some linen, to use as a bandage, he discovered the last note left by Lady Helen. The knight opened it, and read additional proof of the strength of her new-born hate. These were her words: "Fearless and sleepless, Helen of Caermarthen is on thy track, false knight. Thou shalt know no peace while she exists! It shall be the sole aim and object of her life to thwart thy alms. The Spanlards shall know thy plans-- tey shall be forewarned of thy presence, and their galleons shall not cross thy track! Thou mightst have had a dove upon thy bosom, but now a tigress is in thy path 1" , "Right bravely spoken, for a woman!" said the knight, laughing, as he rent the note into fragments. "Had she the power to workl me harm, doubtless she would do it. But she knoweth not enough of my plans to disar- range them materially. Yet she must not leave the island to give alarm to the Span- iards. That must be seen too at once. I will have guard-boats across the entrance of the port at 'once, to prevent any vessel leaving the harbor, which is not thoroughly searched. By procuring assistance from the governor, and offering a worthy reward, I doubtless can soon effect the arrest of all three of the fugi- tives." The knight now had his wound, which was not severe, dressed; and taking a draught of wine to strengthen him, awaited his chief officer, to whom he intended issuing orders which would prevent any sea-ward escape of those whose acts had already become danger. ous and troublesome.   CHAPTER XLVII. Thy imprudence and folly would ruin all my plans!" cried Helen, whose garb unchang- ed, and appearance still made her appear to Percival, whom she addressed, as Constant, Sir Henry Morgan's secretary. 'I It was well that we were so near the place of my retreat, for doubtless search will speedily be made for us!" "It seems to me that thou art rather young to question my acts, and chide so boldly!" said Percival, impatiently. "I was not too young to effect thy escape from the ship of thine enemy and tyrant? nor thou in thy captivity too proud to promise implicit obedience to me if I effected thy escape!" retorted the other. "Nor yet too young to discover a secure place of retreat for thee and thy companion; nor yet 'too young to have formed a plan whereby we can leave. this island and work yet more evil against him whom we both hate!" "Thy pardon, good youth! I both acted hastily at first, and spoke hastily a moment agone. But when I heard his voice so nigh me, and felt the weapon in my hand, not all the saints in Heaven could have stayed my anger for the moment! I owe my degrada- tion, fall from power, my banishment, and present shame to him!" "And would have canceled the debt by taking his one poor lifel" said the youth, scornfully. "I hate him more fervently than thou-for I would have him live to know life's miseries. To meet disalpointment where he  sets his highest hopes: to be foiled whge he undertakes his greatest actions. Death is a release from trouble, and many a oAe would thank the hand that set them free!" "Young as thou art, Sir Secretary, thou dost talk like a philosopher'" said Percival. Then looking around the small close room, lighted by a dim lamp, he asked: "' Hast thou not something in the way of refreshment here?  We have been well nigh starved on musty buiscuit, hard as our fate, and salt-beef as tough as misery!" "Thou shalt have food and drink presently. But be quiet, and stir not from this room, for peril environs us!" said the Lady fHelen, quietly-and she left the room by a door which was hidden by a dusty curtain. The house, in truth, from the dust on id scanty furniture, and cobwebs about its ceiling, seem- ed to. have been long unoccupied. "Well, Brompton, what thinkest thou of this new phase in our adventures?" asked Percival, as soon as they were alone. "If it holdeth out, I shall like itl" replied the other. "But for my life I cannot seedwhat sudden cause this young secretary hath found to hate his late master so bitterly. I am apt   to compare effects witi their- cause, and in this case I do not feel satisfied. There may be some plot working to our further injury! I distrust the youth!" "I do not. 1He frankly told us he wanted our help in a work of vengence upon Sir Henry, and if we would swear to aid him and obey his orders, he would see that we were released." "Ay, that is so, and we are on shore! Yet, how know we that we are free. Perchance at this moment sp:cs or guards are all around us!" "Poh I thou art too suspicious, Brompton. But hark! I hear the clatter of plates! The promised r:fres!ments are doubtless on their way."       . "I hope so, my lord, fgr I am so nearly familhed tlat I co Ild eat raw flesh." "Out on thee for a cannibal! Here is some- thing better!" said Percival, with a laugh, as a negress entered, bearing a huge tray well filled with food, and also a bottle of wine. *' Thou art most welcome, Mistress Ebony!" said Percival, seizing the bottle ere she had placed her tray on the old rickety table. "And thou wilt be thrice welcome each time thou comest thus to minister to our comfort!" The negress made no reply, but leaving the tray, hurried out of the room. Percival and Brolmpton now ate and drank as if they were indeed half famished, which in truth they were; for to men who had lived daintily all their lives, the coarse ship-fare had been most unlpalatable. And as they had no friends on ship-board, they had been given the poorest of the fare to be had there. CHAPTER XLVIII. Early on the ensuing day, Sir Henry Mor- gan had an interview with the governor, re- garding the escape of Percival and Brompton, and the defection of his secretary, tie secret of whose sex and name he still kept, and which was known only to Miriam and Malak, besides himself. The governor 'ordered a strict search to be made for the fugitives in the island,-and Sir Henry offered a large reward for their arrest and return to him. Thus it seemed impossi- ble that they should escape. For the port- captain, aided by the admiral, had established an efficient harbor-guard, so that not even a simple canoe or fishing-boat could pass out of the port unsearched. Patrols were sent into the interior, guards posted in the mountain passes, and on the roads. Sir Henry excused himself for such strenu- ous exertions and stringent measures to re- take the captives, on the plea that they were traitors to the king, and doubtless intended to escape and forewarn the Spaniards on the Main of his coming. Yet, were the truth all   known, he felt considerable personal feeling in the matter. Be that as it may, nothing was left unat- tended to which was calculated to effect their recapture. On the morning of the second day, lie lnade his second visit to the new quarters of ti;e Jew Solomon, whereehe had spent a portion of the previous evening in company with Miriamn, her father, and Doh Enrico Farrago aul his wife. The knight was received with their usual courtesy by the fair Jewess and her father. "Where are thy guests. fair lady?" he ask. ed, after returning their compliments. "They leTt us very suddenly at midnight," replied Miriam. t"A man came, who arouscl my father, saying that he had urgent business with the Spaniard. Fearing tlhat some wrung was intended to our guests, lmy fathr at first refused to arouse the sellor; but when t}ie man requested him to show a signet-ring to Don Enrico, he assented. The moment the Spaniard saw the ring, he lesired that the nCes- seliger should be admitted i and risii:g, liur- riedly dressed himself, and caused his wife to do the same. Aftr a brief conference with the messenger, lie announced to us his inten- tion to depart immediately, saying lat a prov- idential opportunity had occurred by llich  he and his wife could return to their hoCmes. Knowing that thou hadst set tlhell free, and that we had no right, even had we the will. to retain them, we spoke our farewells; and I on1 before the day dawned they departed-incan who came with the messenger bearing away their baggage." "Hell and furies!" sebuted the enraged knight, forgetting for the instant that lie stood in the p)resencoof a lady. "They have fled without ransom, and that fiend, Lady Helen, is at the bottom of the plot. But they can- not have left the town. Ourguards are-every- where on the alert. I will at once speed to the port to see if any vessels have left during the night, or this morning. But if there have, they left not unsearched. The Spaniards and the traitors are yet in the town.' The knight was in error. At that very moment a small, but fast-sailing feludca, which had been used for smuggling by a ruffian band of desperadoes, and which had lain lid- den in a small oove or canal, long unused, and mostly unknown, even to fishermen, though not the quarter of a league from town, was sliding gently out to sea with the last of the land breeze, steering in such a direction as to avoid being seen from the harbor. For the cove from which she sailed lay across and be- yond a point which formed one side of the harbor. In the cabin of this vessel sat the Spaniard and his wife. On herdeck, as owner and ms-   ter, stood Sir Henry Morgan's late secretary. The crew was composed of several of her former owners, and some hard-looking gases which had been hired at Jamaica. Percival and Brompton, and the former captain, who was an admirable pilot in those seas, acted as officers. Thus, well armed and provisioned, Constant, as we yet will know lady Helen, boldly steer- ed a course which would carry them  to Chagres, the nearest port to Panama, where Don Enrice and his wife dwelt whet they ere at ham W CHAPTER XLIX. Days anu even weeks passed, and Sir Henry, hearing not a word from the fugitives, at last believed that by some mysterious means they had escaped from the island, He had not been idle du:iing this time. ile had refitted one of the Spanish galleons, and putting on board a large share of the prize-money taken, had sent it to the king, with letters for the monarch, promising still greater deeds and better fortune speedily. He had sent one of his most trusty officers in charge, and much against his will had also sent Malak to bear letters to Lord Yarncliff and to Coraline and her father. For the black had become most devotedly attached to Iis young master, and seemed to feel that there was no security for his life so good as his own sleepless watchful- hess. But at his master's positive command, being assured that he might speedily return, he went. hlaving announced his intentions to go up- on an expedition wherein great wealth might be gained, and called for volunteers, the ad- miral soon found himself reinforced by four more ships and over one thousand men, many of whom were French, and some Dutch. He cared not, however, what nation they belong- ed to, so that they were willing to fight against the Spaniards under his command. For as he saw his force increasing, and received more vessels, arms, munitions, and provisions-for plenty were ready to furnish where plentiful returns might be expected--his ambition grew with his means, and he actually began to think of the conquest of all the great sad wealthy cities which the Spaniards had planted and built up on the South Aimerican Continent, as well as in their islands of Cuba, Puerto Rico, etc. He found, through the avarice of the gov- ernor, Sir Simon, to whom he pronmied a share in his successes, -A powerful and active coadjutor; and when he was ready to sail, felt himself fully able to cope with all the force which the Spaniards could put upon the water in those seas. He had purposely kept his first point of destination an entire secret from every one   under his command, not even excepting Brodely, his vice-admiral, in whom he repos- ed great trust, for he waq a brave and true man, as well as a skillful seaman, experienced and prudent, as well as valorous. This had he done, because he meditated a blow upon a rich place near at hand, where he wished to try the mettle and strength of his men before he attempted a greater and yet more danger- ous enterprise. The governor had teased him greatly to learn his first point of destination,; but Mor- Igai, determinedlhat no opportunity should the given for any warning to precede him to the place where he intended to strike, kept this information from him until within an hour of the time when he intended to sail. Then over a bottle of the governor's choice wine, he told him that he intended to cruise to the south of Cuba; and if he did not fall in with prizes at sea, to attack, conquer, and sack the town of Puerto Principe  "God's mercy! Thou'rt too bold, Sir Hen- ry t cried the astonished governor. "'Tis a fortified town-lhath a governor and a regi- ment or more of troops to defend it, besides the inhabitants, some thousando in number." "They are only Spaniards!', said Morgan, contemptuously. "At the first sound of my drums and the shouts of mydJnn, they will turn their backs and fly! Besides, 1 shall take them so unexpectedly that they will. be panic-stricken, believing that we are devils dropped from the sky, or belched up'from below!" "Perhaps,". slid the governor, while he du- biously shook his head, and began to think that he had invested mere largely than wis- dom would warrant in so desperate a venture But he knew that if he had, it was too late to repent, for the fleet lay all ready todepart, with a fair and fresh wind blowing, only waiting for the admiral's signal to trip their anclhors and be under way. Therefore be drank to the success of the daring young knight, and bade him farewell. Half an hour later, the fleet were all un- der canvas, and amid the thunder of parting salutes exchanged between the ships and town batteries, they scudded away like glad se- birds over the ocean's foaming breast. CHAPTER L. Each captain in the fleet had been provided with sealed orders, to be opened only in ease of his separation from the fleet, by which he would be informed where the general rendez- vous would be, in'case of a storm causing a dispersion of the vessels; But the general instructions were to keep well-closed with the admiral unless signaled to do otherwise, and to constantly exercise their crews at arms, so as to fit them for service.   It was not until they had sighted the south- ern coast of Cuba, that Morgan, heaving his vessel to, signaled for all his captains to come on board, and then announced to them his intention of landing at thead df the Bay of San Maria, with all hisforces except a guard for each ship, and marching i up to Puerto Prioipe, a town known to be full of wealth. The announcement, though it as much sur- prised the captains as Morgan hoped to sur- prise the Spaniards, pleasedl them exceeding- ly. None more than Brodely, who, however, asked with his accustomed prudence if there was a pilot in the fleet who could take them safely into the bay. "For," said he, glancing at the great chart which hunm in the cabin, " the approaches to this southern coast are filled with sunken reefs and dangerous shoals. "I have a volunteer in Captain Domingo, whom I took in the Catalina galleon!" replied the admiral. "He saith he knoweth the har- bor and its entrance well; and as his life will be the forfeit, if but a keel graze a rock, I think we may trust to him." "' Ay, for hip cowardice will insure his fidel- ity! Yet he Is a miserable wretch to betray his own countrymen, and lead their foes upon them " "Es cierto!" muttered a young Spaniard, who had been chosen from among the prison- ers to act as a servant in the cabin; and who, not being suspected of understanding Eng- lish, had not been excluded from the cabin during the conference. But his words were not heard, and he seem- ed so occupied in brightening some of the ad- miral's plate, that no one would have thought that he had heard and understood every word which had been spoken. The admiral, after having liberally refresh- ed his visitors with wine and still stronger li- quors, dismissed them, with directions to be ready on the next night, at an early hour, to land their forces. It was-his intention to lay by at a sufficient distance from the point of landing to prevent discovery during the day, then to run In, land, and march to the town, so as to surprise it as early as possible, and thus to win a bloodless victory. CHAPTER LI. The night intended for debarkation was a lovely one, even for that ever-lovely clime. The moon, at its full, rode through a sky that was almost cloudless-though here and there a light fleece moved athwart the sky, fanned along by the gentle breeze, which, barely tilling the sails of the fleet, enabled it slowly ;uIi noiselessly to glide along over the smooth waters of the beautiful bay, known as Santa Maria. The night was so light, that had it   'not been an hour when most people were abed, or supposed to be, there would have been nearly as great danger of discovery as if it had been day. The waving palms, the gold-fruited orange and lemon, the fields of banana-all could be seen, as they glided along by the bold shores.  At last, they arrived at the point where the renegade pilot told the admiral he must an- chor: and, as noiselessly as possible, the sails were clewed up, and anchors dropped. And while those anchors were splashing into the water, unobserved by any of the crew. the young Spaniard, before-mentioned, nian- iged to drop over the side; and, by diving far away from the ship, and swimming low, and with great caution, lie t.,anaged to realch the shore. unsen. he had 'runI a fearful risk; but his was a true heart, and he waa the opposite of the treacherous dastard, Do- mingo. Boats were now lowered from the ships, and the landing commenced. Morgan, ar- rayed in an elegant and showy uniform, was the first to touch the strand; and he was fol- lowed by a standard-bt arer, who bore a coun- terpart flag to that which he usually wore at his foremast-head: the dagger-pierced heart. It took some time for the large body of men to land, and to form under their respect- ive leaders-the more especially, that strict silonce had been enjoined, and orders had to be. passed in low tones from man to man. At least two hours thus passed, when the column was formed and ready to proceed ; and an enthusiastic mrmurur of joy passed along the ranks, as their officers, for the first time, in- formed them whither they were bound. But just as Morgan had given the order to march, while yet it lacked full an hour of the day's dawning, the sound of heavy guns, and then the tolling of bells, was heard from the direction of the city. "By the head of Saint George, there hath been treachery somewhere! The Spaniards are alarmed, and know that we are coming " cried Sir Henry. "Ay, good admiral; and they will strive to make this a hot day for us," said Brodely, who stood by his ide I care not! Miy foot is on the shore; and though I wade kpee-deep in blood, I will not turn my back until amy work is done. For- ward, my braves, and give them something to ilake a noise about." The men replied to Sir Henry's shout with heartv cheers; and pressed on close after the vanguard, which, with drums beating and colors flying, marched rapidly on over the flowery plains, which, for a short distance, lay spread beyond the bay. But soon hills arose in their line of march; and bad it not been for their guide, the renegado Domingo, *^-^   it would have been difficult for them to have I found, among the rocky ravines, a pass through thqse hills to the plain upon which I the town was built; The rising sin found them threading a narrow path throukh these rocky and dehsely-wooded defiles, where am- buscades, property planted, might easily l have' checked their march, and destroyed  many men. Bui the Spaniards had not received timely warning, even if this idea had been enter- tained-for at last, without any interruption, Morgan reached the plain, and beheld the domes and spires of the city before him. As his men came out, company by com- pany, frot among the hills, and formed in line of battle on either side his colors, their cheers rung loud and far upon the clear air. Toward the city, there could be seen a large mass of troops, horsemen and foot, forming in battle order, to dispute the progress of the invaders; while toward the mountain., east- ward still, crowds of women and children seemed to be flying, terror-stricken. Morgan knowing well that every monent's delay would be a loss, enabling the inhabit- ants to conceal and carry off their wealth, which alone he coveted, gave the order for his men to advance in solid line, four ranks deep, he leading the centre in person. The governor of the town, a brave soldier and a true knight, at the head of a large body of horse-having infantry and armed citizens in reserve-dashed forward in a charge, at full speed. Morgan did not halt his line until the horse. men were fully within range, when bidding the front rank to kneel, and the next to fire over their heads-the two rear ranks reserv- ing their fire-he poured in a withering vol- ley, which was so well aimed, that it fairly nowed the Spaniards down in rows. The two rear ranks were immediately advanced, passing between the men of the first, who hastened to reload; and the second fire rnmong the Spaniards, who were already broken and confused, drove them back with terrible loss. Most of their officers were slain; among them, the brave governor. Waiting only to load, the buccaneers, who had not yet lost a man, charged, in turn, with terrible shouts. The cavalry now fled-at least all which survived-but re-formed onee more in the rear of the infantry. The latter, forming in close order, nolo oly advanced, as if determined to meet their invaders hand to hand. Morgan now slightly altered his line of battle-advancing(both his wings, so as to form a crescent, thus exposing the Spaniards, who were in column, to a cros fire, and ap- parently offering to surround them. In a brief time the hate of the buonaneerq   brought them within range of the infantry, and fire opening on both sides, the parties were soon so enveloped in smoke, that but for their respective warshiouts, it was almost im- possible to tell friend from foe, But slowly the cloud of battle rolled backward ;o the town-for the Spaniards fought bravely, aad sullenly retired, step by Step, leaving the ground covered with their dead and wounded. The buccaneers began now to feel the effects of the battle, not alone in the heat and dust which weakened them, and made them suffer with thirst, but also in fatal casualties-for the shot of the Spaniards caused many of them to bite the ground in their death-agony. But onward still they pressed, cheered by the bugle-like voice of their young leader, whose valor never shone more conspicuously than now. Wherever his flag was seen- wherever his keen blade swept-a terrible row of fallen foes was to be found. Four long hours were occupied in thi struggle ere the city was entered by the fu- rious buccaneers; and even yet, fighting from their houses, the desperate Spaniards resisted. Nor did they give over until Mor- gan swore tnat he would burn the town; and destroy, without quarter, every man, woman, and child within it, if they resisted longer. Then such as had not already fled to the woods and mountains, yielded themselves prisoners, and were driven in droves to the great churches, where they could be best guarded while the work of pillage went on. And now, reader, let me draw a veil over the succeeding horrors of that day and night. A city given over to cruel rapine and pil. lage-given over to a band of blood-thirsty, cruel, lawless men, who knew no pity, felt no remorse, feared no God! Let imagination paint the scene for you, if ye choose-I will not! It is enough for me to say, that the city was taken and sacked. CHAPTER LII. When the fleet, under Morgan, with drums and bugles sounding-amid the intervals of the roar of artillery-and with gay colors floating triumphantly from every masthead, appeared once more off the harbor of Kings- town, the people acted as if their joy had driven them crazy. Colors of every sort floated from imprompt flag-staffs-salutes were fired from the batteries, and from every sort of fire-arm which men or boys could muster ; and many a lusty cheer went forth to welcome the hardy adventurers who, hav- ing periled life for gold, now returned to risk life in the wild excesses and extravagances linked with the getting rid of it. For well did those keen-eyed citizens know, that money recklessly won would be all as reck. "Thou didst act most nobly, and vell-deo   leesly spent among them. Therefore, they rejoiced. And the governor, to do especial honor to the occasion, mustered his heterogeneous guard, and with four drummers, as many bu- glers, and a huge negro bearing the royal standard of England, went forth in person to mnet the knighly victor at the landing. Sir Simon was arrayed in a gaudy uniform -his immense sword trailed, as usual, behind him, while his gold-headed cane was borne with the grace of a band-master-or rather that of a drum-major. Iad Iackett lived in his day, he would halve dressed after Sir Si- mon to perfectly represent Sir John Falstaff. In a brief timet after they first hove in sight, the vessels entered \le harbor and came to an anchor. Soon thereafter, the barge of the admiral was lowered to the water and manned ; and then, bearing the Spanish standard beneath the English to dignify his victory. Sir Henry embarked for the shore, dressed in his ricl;eet garb. He landed amid the cheers of the multitude assembled; and Sir Simon, waddling for- ward, attempted to embrace him, and would have succeeded but for the protuberosity- there is a new word for you-of his body. which was certainly so great that he could only reach the shoulders of the young knight with his finger ends, while lis arms were stretched to their utmost length. But he touched him, and said: "Come to my bosom, thou valorous knight! Thou hast, I can see, given the vile Spaniards a sound drubbing, and doubtless taken a mine of wealth. Come to my bosom-let me press thee to my heart!" If the governor's heart was in his belly, as it is situated in more than one gluttonous bi- ped whom I know, the young knight was pressed to Sir Simon's heart. The people cheered again, the drums and bugles struck up in anything but concert, and the governor faced about his guard and grave- ly marched bask to the palace, while Sir Hen- ry, walking by his side, related his adven- tures, and filled the avaricious governor's heart with hopes of boundless wealth from his future conquests. The latter freely prom- ised him every aid from his government as well as private resources, and to use all the influence he possessed to strengthen Sir Iten- ry's force, so that the latter would be able to undertake some of the gigantic projects which he lald before him. i"What wilt thou next undertake? Where next carry thine invincible arms, Sir Hen- ry?" asked the governor. "If thou wilt pledge thy honor to keep the secret, I will tell thee," replied Morgan. "That will I do, and keeD my pledge," an- swered the governor. \       o   "Then so soon as my men are recovered from the debauch which it were vain to strive to keep them fr, m and my forces warrant the undertaking, I shall capture the wealthy town of Puerto Bello, in the province of Cos- ta Rica." "By mine honor, thou art bold, indeed, Sir Henry. 'Tis a 'large town, well-fortified, and strongly garrisoned!" "True, and a wealthy one, therefore wor- thy of my ambition. When my messengers return from the king, I sltl1 undertake a yet greater conquest which,  achieved, will leave me nothing else to wish for. I ask but one year more of success to crown the bright- est hopes of my life, both for fame and for- tune!"         i%2 "And that great venture, Sir Henry, is-" "I shall reveal to no one what it will be until it is undertaken. But, Sir Simon, I see that we are opposite the quarters of the king's agent, my friend Solomon. I must pay him a brief visit, and then I will join thee at thy house." "Do-and make haste Sir Henry. My morning's walk hath made me faint, and I both hunger and thirst. Yet will I neither open bottle or touch food until thou dost join me!" "( I will hasten, Sir Simon-yet fast not on my account," replied Sir Henry, as he turned aside and entered the dwelling of the Jew. CHAPTER LIII. '"I have returned in triumph, from a most succeBsful venture, and yet, fir Miriam, thou dost scarcely greet me with a smile, while thy father, usually so calm and passive, is full of joy," said Sir Henry, reproachfully ,to the lovely Jewess; for, in truth, she had received him very coldly. "Alas, noble knight "-and as she spoke, her pale lips quivered and tears filled her eyes-" alas, noble knight, I am un mny father. I care not for gold. And if would shudder to touch it if it had been o tained at the cost of human life. I I card th wild shouts of thy Inen-heard the shrill tones of martial music, and the deafening thunders of thy canonr; but I thought of sounds more terrible'-of the groans of dying men, the, shrieks of terror-stricken women, the moans of outraged virtue, the cries of poor children! I saw the crkcl-ling flames of cities going into ashes-heard the gushing of hot, red blood, and the crushing of bones beneath lead and steel, and my heart was horror-stricken!" "I' faith, lady, thou dost draw a strong picture. Thou wouldst never be a fitting bride for a soldier." "I shall never be a bride, Sir Henry," said the Jewess, in a quiet, mournful tena "   "While I live, I owe all my love and devo- tion to my father. When I tie, I shall thank the Qod of Israel that he hath permitted me to rest. But excuse me. sir knight--thou hast business with my father, without doubt, and my place is not here." And the maiden, with .a graceful inclina- tion, turned and left the apartment. "Thy daughter is a strange girl, good Sol- mon," said the knight, thoughtfully. "Thou dost utter the truth, Sir Henry. But she is pure, generous; and noble in every thought, and above all worldliness," replied the Jew. "I believe thee!" answered the other. "UBut I suppose thou wouldst rather hear how I have prospered than to talk of her?" I can never weary in talking of the child of my love, yet I will gladly hear that thou hast made a brilliant and successful voyage, and that more for thy sake than mine own! For, notwithstanding the percentage which thy generosity allows me is great, I, like my child, begin to value gold less than I once did." "The passion will come back to thee when thou dost look at some of the treasures which I bear. What are these jewels worth?" And as the knight asked this question, he drew a bag from beneath his short cloak, which until then had completely concealed it, and emptied its contents, glittering like fire, upon the table before which he sat. "Holy Moses!" cried the Jew, as diamonds, emeralds, pearls, and rubies, set in golden rings, necklaces, crosses, and bracelets, lay sparkling before him. "Why, Sir Henry, thou knowest not the almost priceless value of the treasure!" And the Jew took up ornament after orna- ment, and with rapture descanted upon the worth and beauty of the same. "This," said the knight, after the Jew had become almost breathless from rapid talking, "is mine own private matter, secured separate and apart from the main spoil of our expedi- tion, which is also immense 1" "What meanest thou, Sir Henry.? I do not comprehend thee!" "I will explain. When I was trying to re- strain my men from indiscriminate slaughter, I saved a beautiful girl from wrong, whom her father was vainly striving to defend from some ruffianly Frenchmen who had followed in my train of volunteers, I slew one who would not obey me, and drove the rest back. The Spaniard, who seemed noble and wealthy, placed that bag in my hand with apparent words of gratitude, judging from his looks and actions; for I do not understand the tongue, though I have taken a master, and hope speedily to compass it." served good fortune. But here is a ransom   for a princel Doubtless the Spaniard had gathered his wealth, intending to fly to some place of safety." "Ay, as many did-leaving, perhaps, thrice as much as we saved from them! There is no end to the riches of these Spaniards-even as their atrocities upon the poor native Indiana, in gathering such wealth, are innumerable and unending!" "So have I heard! And were all of my race poor, we would not be so persecuted as we are, and have been." "Thou art safe from persecution now, good Solomon." "Thanks to thee, for it, noble knight' and generous patron. I never can speak my gra- titude: alife's devotion only can prove it." "Poh-poh, good friend; thou dost set too much value on my poor services. I havenbut done my duty to thee and thine. But I came near forgetting the poor governor, who said that he would neither eat nor drink until I joined him, though he was faint with hunger and thirst. I must haste, lest his 'too solid flesh' should melt, and he become ' lean fav ored,' like one of Pharaoh's kihe. Take these jewels, and keep them safely/ for me, good Solomon; and on the morrow come to me and: take account from our general stock, of what is due the king. We will allot thprize-mony. at the government-house." "Tarry, Sir Henry, if it please thee, until  I take account of these jewels, and give thee a receipt for them." "But it doth not please me to tarry, and still loss would i; plnase me to show that I doubt- ed thy honesty, by taking a receipt of thee! Take thou the jewels-I know that not one is endangered in thy hands. Not a word: I must hasten to the governor, or he will perish from long abstinence, and fatigoe." And the careless knight turned away, with this; leaving the Jew to feast his eyes again upon the jewels, and to relate to his daughter the action by which Sir Henry became the. owner of them. CHAPTER LIV. "I'faith, good Sir Henry! I thought that thou wouldst never come: and so I drank a couple of thimblefulls of punch, and ate a, mouthful of cold chicken, to keep life in mo," said Sir Simon, when Morgan entered his room and found the bones, only, left of a fat capon, and the governor in the act of pouring out hie- third "thimbleful" of punch, into a goblet which held more than half a quart. "I scame as quickly as I could, my dear Sir' Simonl" replied the knight. "But as thou art aware, r had business with the Jew, and it detained me." ' Rather say that the beauty of his comely, daughter shained thee."   "Sir Simon, the maiden is naught to me 1" aid Sir Henry, rather sternly. "Pardon me, Sir Henry; I meant not to anger thee. In truth, the maiden is very beautiful, and I only wish that I stood as fair in her favor as thou dost. I have made sun- dry and divers complimentary speeches to her; and, wouldst thou believe it, she listened gravely until I was done, and then laughed in ray face." "Laughed at thy wit, without doubt." No, good Sir Henry. No, but more like- ly 'twas at my big belly : for she said she did net think I could love anything so well as a good dinner. I praised the color of her cheeks, and she said that 'twas not half so rih as that on my nose. But I forgave her- for her beauty I forgave her: But here am I rmnning on like an old fool, while thou art perishing f,r something to eat and drink. Let me help thee to a goblet of punch, and I will send for a half-dozen bottles of wine, a round of beef, and a couple of chickens. What miserable chickens they have here-I never saw one that would go over ten pound weight I One can hardly keep from starving here!" Sir Henry could scarce keep from laughing at the specimen of a famine-fed man before him, but courtesy and policy both forbade that; and when the refreshments came in, he partook of them with a fair sea-appetite. "To-morrow, with thy leave, Sir Simon, we will have all the spoils of our lte venture exhibited in thy great hall, androper ap- praisement made thereon, and theisual divis- ion made."  Atv, good Sir Henry, if ito pleaseth thee .n * I think it best to make our ivions pub- lrly, for two reasons," continued organ. "First, the sight of so much treasure will cause volunteers to look to my standard. Next, none can gainsay the fairness of our transaa- tions, and the justice of our partitions." "M ost true, Sir Henry. Yet I have a ques- tion to ask thee, and though my ideas may lan slightly to thy benefit and mine, yet do  not think 1 mean dishonesty. Now we are ] but two, and the others who share are man, what harm would occur were we to lay aside  a few choice articles-a few of the golden v doubloons, or a bag of silver, and not count ] them in the general stock The many would ' scares feel a loss so greatly divided, while we s two would put a snug penny away. What sayest thou, good Sir Henry T  "That I will neither defaud the king, nor I yet the brave men who risk life and limb to  obtain the treasure 1" oried Morgan, with well- i asumed indignation. "Thou knowest me not, i Sir Simon-thou knowest me not!"    t "Ay, now I do, indeed, know thee, thou truly trusty, loyal, and noble servant of the i   king, our master!" cried Sir Simon, in an h. stant turning the wind to his own favor. "I did did but suggest the matter to try thee. Not for an instant would I be guilty 9f such a cruel fraud, or countenance it!" "Then thine insult was premeditated, was it?" cried Sir Henry, rising and putting his hand to the hilt of his sword. "By the honor of a knight thou shalt answer for it, and that right speedily!" "But, good Sir Henry, I meant not to in- sult thee+-on mine honor I did not!" "Why, the doubt of mine honesty is im- plied in the very statement that thy vile pro- position was made to try me." "I did it thoughtlessly, Sir Henry. Believe me, I did, for I value hee and thy friendship too highly to give thee cause of quarrel. I crave thy pardon! Surely thou wilt grant it!" The knight seemed to study over the matter some time, and his brow was anger-clouded while he did so. Feeling guilty himself, it behooved him, like most hypocrites, to appear very innocent. But at last he seemed to melt, and he said: "I must excuse thee, Sir Simon, for thou hast repaired thy grave error with many apologies. Yet let me caution thee that I hold mine honor dearer than life, and he who trifles with it tampers with his own existence. I will speak or think of thy offence no more." Thanks, Sir Henry-thanks! And now let us baptize this reconciliation over a fresh bottle of wine." The knight did not refuse, although he thoroughly understood the principles of Sir Simon, and without doubt would have closed with his offer had he not doubted the prudence of the governor. Or, perhaps, with less charity, we may say, that he was disposed to have no partner in his iniquity, and wished the lion's share, which means all. CHAPTER LV. "What thinkest thou now, fair sir, of the ehances which the bold buccaneer, Sir Henry Morgan, will have in attempting to cross the wild mountains, the mazy lagoons, and to pass through the wild and torturous ravines which we have threaded in our way hither from the port of Chagres?" asked Don Enrico Farra- go of Lady Helen, still only known as Con- stant, late secretary to Sir Henry Morgan. When this question was asked, the Spaniard, and his wife, and Constant, with Percival and Brompton, stood in a group, gazing toward the golden-domed city of Panama, which had just roken upon their view, as they emerged from the wild mountain-passes eastward of that city. You Spaniards crossed the same dangers, in the face of hostile natives, to amass wealthh   le will do the same," replied Constant, quietly. "But he will have Spaniards, not Indians, to oppose him!" "So he had when he took the galleons, with but little loss!" said Constant, in the same quiet tone. "He must first passthe fort at Chagres, which, already strong, will be yet strength- tned in men and guns, when I inform our governor of the danger of an invasion!" "Fear not but that he will try it, and rav- age all the coast where wealth can be obtained, unless by some strategy he is destroyed, or an overwhelming force led against him!" !"What thinkest thou, Seior Englesa?" asked Farrago, turning to Percival. "That Master Constant over-rates the pi- rate greatly!" said Percival, scornfully. '"No one should know his daring or his valor better than Lord Percival; for he has tried it, and that to his cost!" said Constant, with a sneer. "Did I not wish to reserve my'sword for him alone, thou shouldst answer for that taunt, young man!" said the degraded noble, angrily. "I am ready at any time, Lord Percival. Thou has of late forgotten my service to thee, and becom(e not only ungrateful, but insolent. I am ready to teach thee a lesson at steel's point!"' "Nay, gentlemen, ye shall not quarrel!" cried Farrago. "Remember that ye are now my guests; and I am responsible alike for the safety and comfort of both I Be at peace, I pray thee, and let us hasten on to rest and enjoyment, after a journey so full of peril and hardship!" "Ay, do, for my sake!" said Doia Anita, beseechingly. "For thy sake, fair lady, I would make peace with my greatest foe!" said the dastard lord, in a tone and with a look which showed that he was yet at heart a libertine. The lady turned coldly away from him, and, by the aid of her husband, remounted her mule; for all the party had dismounted, to rest, And, without any further comment, the par- ty proceeded as rapidly as they could toward Panama-the then wealthiest city on the American continent. CHAPTER LVI. The division of booty nade by Sir Henry, though it was made in public, and, as the governor supposed, with the nicest honesty, did not suit all parties. The French portion of his followers-a greedy, avaricious set- declared that all the booty had not been ex- hibited, and that their shares were far below the mark of right and justice. Sir Henry became exceedingly wroth with them; cursed   them as a beggarly set of frog enters; and, driving them from his presence,.swore, that never again should they share in an enterprise of his. His Englishmen, who cared but little, so long as they had a few pounds to spend for rum, tobacco, grub, etc., and time to go on a drunken spree, made no complaint; for their admiral, who was idolized by them, told them to haste and spend their prize-money, for he was in a hurry to go after more. This information was received with loud cheers by all but the discontented Frenchmen; and the men, as rapidly as each received a share, hastened away to the expectant harpies outside, to lavish, in wild and licentious de- baucheries, the money so riskily and hardly earned. To the towns-people, in every line, a rich harvest now opened; for money so wildly spent n!ust must needs be widely cir- culated. It were needless, even were it not a disgusting task, for me to paint such scenes and revels as now occurred. The share which Sir Henry reserved for the king was large, even though he divided profits again with the governor and Solomon ; and he again dispatched a safe messenger with the king's portion, in a small vessel, wlich lie found that he could spare; for well he knew that his actions, completely outside of all na- tional law, would require golden arguments to justify them at home. Of this he had Ilcen warned by both of his friends--Yarneliff and Ethelbert. And he had sense enough to know, that success would gild the darkest ac- tions; and proof, in gold, to a needy king, would outweigh all report and rumors. And his tireless ambition looked now to a peerage as proud as that of Caermarthen's earl, and more acres yet than Cedric could count as his own. We will not say that his ambition quite ex- tinguished his love for Coraline, or even shaded her memory; for well he knew, and oft he thought, that the attainment of immense wealth would give him the power to command pleasure for her, and to realize the hopes which were to make her his own. For Morgan was a singular compound, with but few, yet some counterparts, even in this modern day. Naturally sanguine and ardent, passions of the moment were, with him, as quick as the flame of ignited powder, and almost as transient. Yet, withal, his deep love for the one to whom he had given his heart never ceased. It was rooted in the soil of his-heart, and the tem- porary flush of passion could not affect it. But we must hasten on, lest our chapters grow prosy, and our readers weary in their journey.  CHAPTER LVII. It required less than two weeks for the reck- less followers of Morgan to spend theirbooty;   and, as soon as they began to sober from their excesses, they became clamorous for action. Morgan, taking advantage of this feeling, hastened to put his little fleet in battle order once more; and as soon as this was done, and his force so recuperated as to justify action, he again set sail-this time steering westward into the Carribean Sea, toward the Costa Rican shores, yet keeping, as before, his des- tination a secret from every one in his fleet. This very mystery added to hia power; for his hitherto successes had gained him the en- tire confidence of his officers and men, and they were willing to follow whithersoever he led, without counting the peril or fearing the result. It was just ten' days after he sailed-ten days of easy sailing before pleasant, but light easterly breezes, that they made land ahead, fcom the look-out on the admiral's ship. The breeze was freshening, and the sun within an hour of going dowp, when this discovery was made. Morgan, oFdring all sail to be crowd- ed on his own vessel, signaled te the fleet to close up, so as to make the least bhow to any who might be on the look-out landward. This done, lie went aloft with the renegade Captain Domingo, who, being well rewarded and as- sured of protection, was acting as his guide and pilot, to see what land they had made, and if they had strudl the spot which their dead-reckoning indicated; for, in those days, chronometrical longitudes could not be ob- tained; and while now we can make a "land- fall" within a half-mile, after sailing two or three thousand miles, they then thought them-' selves lucky and skillful if they came within five or six leagues of the point they had shaped their course for. "What land dost thou see, Spaniard?" ask- ed Sir Henry, after Domingo had scanned the coast ahead through the spy-glass. "I discover the headland. of Puerto Naos, gracious admirall We have hit our point precisely. It is but ten leagues to Puerto Bello; and before it is dark, we will reach and crose the bar at the river's mouth, and then 'twill be an easy sail up the river, and thou canst land thy forces at the city before the dawn of day 1' "Were it not best to lay off the land until dark to avoid discovery?" "I dare not cross the bar in the dark, most noble admiral; for the channel is narrow, and hath several ugly turns." "Then we wilgo on. It is not likely that our character will be known, for I will at once have Spanish colors hoisted i" ,   It were well, noble air, for I see a small, lateen-sailed periagua coming out over the bar. Most like she bears a pilot." ' It is well. Her crew must be enticed on board and secured, that I may know how the   own stands, so far as preparation is concerns ed, and where their sentinels are posted?" And the admiral, directing Domingo still to remain at his post of observation, and to call him if he noted anything which required his presence, descended to his deck to give fur- ther orders. As the vessels of Morgan's fleet, with a fine, weatherly breeze, stood in rapidly, and the peringua coming out, close-hauled, laid a course for them, it was not long before she was within the admiral's hail. Bidding oneof his men hail her in Spanish, Sir Henry Mor. gan ordered her to come alongside, while ho brought his vessel around in the wind, so as to deaden her headway. Without any hesitation, the man who steer- ed the little vessel did so. He was a very old man, with a white beard, and long, white hair, clad in the garb of a fisherman, and looked as if he and Poverty were twin brothers. For his scantily-clad form was thick and bent, and he seemed weak and helpless. A young boy was the only other person on board, and ho alone managed the sails of the little craft. The old man having, with great difficulty, climbed the steep sides of Sir Henry's ship, was conducted aft into the presence of the admiral, who would have questioned him con- cerning the situation of Puerto Bello. But to his utter astonishment, the old man, without speaking, drew a package from beneath his ragged vest, and handed it to him. The admiral looked at the superscription, and turned pale and red alternately with an. ger and apprehension, for it was written in the well-known hand of Constant, and addressed to: "Sir Henry Morgan, the English pirate!" "Who gave thee this, old man ." he asked, angrily. "The writer, and bade me give it to thee, sir knight," said the old man, alml, a , sho ing no fear. "To me? Knowest thou who s am W" Thy name is upon the letter!" "Hast thou ever seen me before?" "No 1" "How didst thou know me? fHow knowest thou now that I am Sir Henry Morgan t" "By the star upon thy breast, and that ring upon thy finger. Those were tokens of rec- ognition, and thy face and form were also so described, that I would have know thee among a thousand other knights." "Thou art a bold varlet. What thinkes thou thy life is worth?" "So little that thou wouldst not take it from me!" "What induced thee to bear me this iet- ter?" "Gold! I was poor. He who wrote the letter paid me to deliver it when a ship like   this, with a dragon for its figure-head, appear- ed off this port!" "Hast thou read the contents of the let- ter?" "No. The seal is yet unbroken." (True! When and from whom didst thou receive it?" "About three or four weeks past; of a young man who commanded a small felucca, which put in here in a bad stress of weather." "Whither was the felucca bound?" "To the port of Chagres-having passen- gers for Panama!" "Did its commander communicate with the Governor of Puerto Bello?" "He did; and warned him of thy coming. But the governor laughed at the idea, and said thought was folly." "And hath the governor made no prepara- tion to oppose me?" "No-for he doth not believe that thou, or all the English in these seas,would dare to attack a city so strong, and guarded by over one thousand soldiers!" "What dost thou believe?" "Seeing thee, I believe thou wilt dare the attack." "*Ay, and succeed, old man!" Thie old Spaniard said nothing, but a quiet smile and a look of doubt expressed his thoughts           -  "Thou canst show me where the sentinels are posted?" continued the admiral "I can, but will not! I am no traitor to my country, or my God!" replied the old man, looking the renegade, Domingo, in the face, as he came aft to speak to the admiral. "How, knave? When thou art in my pow- er wilt thou refuse to serve me?" t My life may be thine, but my will is my own, Sir Englishman That man can pilot thee, and play the part of villain-I-will not." And the old Spaniard pointed scornfully to Domingo, who stood trembling with mingled shame and anger before hin. "Thou art insolent. When I have passed the bar with my vessels, I will take thee in hand, and we will see if thy spirit cannot be tamed'a little I Let this man be taken below,' and closely guarded by a file of men." And while this last order was being obeyed, the admiral turned to Domingo, to inquire what he wanted. "We are nearing the bar, noble admiral, and it will be necessary to signal to each ves- sel to follow us in single line  to steer ex- actly in our wakes Once in tlf iver, and all is plain sailing until we reach uerto Pontin, where we take to the boats for landing 1" The necessary signals were made, and then Sir Henry retired into his cabin to read the strangely-brought dispatch in his state-room   alone, where no one could observe his emo- tions. CHAPTER LVIII. The face of the young knight became livid with anger, as he read the following words, and his stout frame quivered with passion. The note ran thus: "Sir Henry, thou hast trampled on the true heart of a weak, fond woman. In so daing, thou hast learn. ed her who loved-all too blindly and far too well- how to hate. And thou hast given her strength; for she has not only drawn off thy intended victim, the Scfiora Farrago, but also her husband, free of the ran- som which thy avarice would have demanded. She has freed Percival and Brompton, that she may use them as tools to effect thy ruin. She has warned the Spaniards of the coast of thy intended coming; and if thou wilt seek her at Panama, she will see that thou art hotly welcomed. Thou shalt be met on every hand-thy forces shall be cut off, the king shall know how loyally thou didst take the Jewish maiden from his grasp, and to the utterniost my hate shall pursue thee. I live only to punish thee, and in thy dying hour I will scorn and spit upon thee. IHELEN OF CAERMARTIIEN." "Ten thousand curses on the fiend! She works, indeed, with more than a woman's strength, to show her hate. But she will yet be in my power, and once there I will keep her in safetfy until I can send her back in shane unto her father!" muttered Sir tlenry, as he tore the letter into a thousand fragments, and cast them through the open cabin wkn- dow. This done, he went again to the deck, for his ship was rapidly closing in with the lanid. It was midnight, when the vessels of Mor. gan's fleet reached the point where they were obliged to anchor, and where his crews, already armed and ready, were to take boats for their landing. The admiral had in vain questioned the old man and the boy who had accompa- nied him in the periagua as to the location of the sentinels-neither threats nor bribes could make them traitors to their people. But the renegade Domingo assured him that he knew well where every sentinel was posted, and would before the dawn see that he and his forces'were led safely and quietly into the very heart of the city, if such watch only was kept as the old Spaniard first reported. And trusting tofaithless faith, but keeping him ever within reach of his sword, Morgan at the head of his silent band, moved on under the guid- ance of Domingo. Soon they were hailed by a sentinel, who, in the darkness, did not see the solid columns of the buccaneers, but only Morgan and his guide, who were a few paces in advance. 4 Que Viva?" rung out sharp and clear on the still night air. , Piscadores es Espana!" replied Domingo, still advancing; and being within reach of   the sentinel before the latter was aware, he sprung upon him with a sudden bound, and dashed him to the earth. To gag and secure- ly bind him was but the work of a moment, and then their path toward the town was for some ways unobstructed. But being come to the very entrance of the town, they found a small castle, or fort, wherein it was said that most of the garrison of the city was quarter- ed. This, in silence, Sir Henry surrounded with all his forces, ad-then, on pain of in- stant death if he refued, forced the captured sentinel to lil them ahd ask admittance. This he did but a better look-out was sus- tained here thn he had kept, and the forces of Morgan wee discovered and instantly fired upon. Several of his men being wounded, their cries of pain and rage fully revealed to the Spaniards who and what they were, and the action at once became fierce and bloody. The town was alarmed,and the shrieks of terror- stricken women and children, and the shouts of excited men, rose loud amid the rattle of musketry and the roar of artillery. The English were far better marksmen than the Spaniards, and the latter suffered terribly. Morgan called upon them to surrender atdls- cretion, and promised mercy-but as they re- fused to do so, he would not leave a man alive. Procuring storming ladders, the force of Sir Henry soon mounted the walls, and the castle was taken. The surviving Spaniards now threw lown their arms and plead for quarter; but, true to hisword, and to strike terror into the hearts of the people who were gathering in force to oppose his entrance into the city, he shut all the survivors up in the magazine; and setting fire to the powder, blew them up, not leaving a soul alive. This exasperated the citizens to desperation; and believing that the English would grant no quarter, they ral- lied under their governor, who was a brave man and a good soldier, and fought with a desperation whish, for a time, made the for- tune of the day ratther dubious for the English forces. Morgan lost many men; but having entered the city, fighting from house to house, he drove the forces of the governor to take refuge in another castle, at the extremity of the town. From the guns of this castle the governor opened such a heavy fire, that Mor- gan found the town too hot for comfort, and knew that if he did not take the castl he must leave the city, and all chance of booty. He had lost too many of his best men in storming the first castle to rashy expose more, if he could avoid it; and advised by the renegade Domingo of the fact that the Spaniards would hardly dare to fire on the priests and nuns of l their religion, he resorted to a cruel expedi- ent, for he seized a large number of them, and fbroed them to march in front of his own force, and to carry the storming ladders.   But the governor was made of sternerstuff than he or Domingo supposed, for he didl not cease firing as Morgan advanced; and thdugh the shrieks and cries of the poor victims reached his ears, they did not touch his heart. The buccaneers, however, at last succeeded in planting their ladders, and with the loss of many men, effected an entrance into the cas- tle. Tired and sick of carnage, Morgan of- fered quarter to all who ceased to resist, but in vain was the offer made to the old governor. Fighting so desperately that it was necessary to slay him to save the lives of his own men, Morgan was forced to have the brave old man killed. The city was now in his hands, and as usual, the mostfrightful excesses were com- mitted, for the men were maddened by the loss of full one-third of their party -mad- dened, too, by the wealth which had esEJed their hands; for during the prolonged resist- ance, many of the people had borne their gold and jewels to the mountains, others had bur- ied their mosj valuable articles, or east them into wells and cisterns, rather than to see them in the hands of their foemen. The news carried by fugitives soon reached Panama, and the governor of that city at once determined, if possible, to crush so dangerous an enemy before he could reach his own, the then wealthiest city on the Continent. He started in person with over fifteen hundred men, but Morgan heard in season of his ad- vance, and taking possession of a gorge in the mountains, with only one hundred men de- feated and drove him back with the loss of nearly half his force. Sir Henry occupied fifteen days in the gath- ering together of his booty and sufficient provision to revictual his ships oatheir return voyage to Jamaica, and then sailed with a fa. voring breeze for Kingston, sending word ere he left that he would soon honor the gov- erior of Panama with a visit. CHAPTER LIX. The reception of Sir Henry, when he reach- ed Jamaica with his victorious fleet from his second successful foray, was even more grand than it had been before, for the citizens a. well as the governor had experienced the reck- less generosity of his wild and daring crews. and knew well by their flags of triumph as much as by the salutes of their cannon, that their trip had been successful. The governor, Sir Simon, again met the admiral with his guard of honor, and announced the safe ar- rival of avessel from England bearing back the faithful Malak, and the officer to whom he had intrusted the treasure he had sent to the king. The faithful negro was at hand to meet his master, and informed him that he had depcs-   ited the letters, which he had brought with the Hebrew, Solomon, for safe keeping. By the side of the neg'o stood another of the same race, but far lighter in color than Malak-younger, too, and slighter in stature -whom he pointed out as having been sent by the fair lady, Coraline, to wait upon lim. "The gift is doubly precious, coming from her!" said Morgan, welcoming the new addi- tion to his retinue with the kinds st words. Then excusing himself to the governor, whose motions were all too slew to suit his impatience, he hurried to the quarters of the Jew, to pro- cure lis letters. One was from the king, writ- ten with his own hatnd-a compliment which but few men in the realm had ever received; for the monarch whose empty treasury had received such timely relief, felt as much gratitude as a king could feel, whose heart was made up of selfishness. Another letter was from the father of Cora- line; yet another, from Lord Yarncliff; and, still more precious than all, was one from Coraline, written in the tenderest of terms, praising his bravery, enpcuraging him to haste in making a sufficient fortune to enable him to return and claim her as his own. "What is thy name?" he asked of the young servant who, with Malak, had followed him to the Jew's house, by his directions; for he had many questions to ask of them. "iamet, kind master," replied the lad, in a gentle tone. "Was thy lady well when thou left her!" "She was; but at times her songs were very sad, for her life is lonely! So she bade mie tell thee; and, also, she bade me beg of thee to be on thy constant guard against the treachery of Lady Helen of Caermarthen, and the bold, bad men who have escaped from thy power. She bade me say that a woman's wit and hate made her a more dangerous foe than a man could be!" "Thy lady was right in that," replied Sir Henry. Already I have had some proof of her power to do me evil, and I expect yet the more, without, by some means, I can secure her person, and send her back to her father, to learn prudence." "The earl mourns for her as dead; for she left in such a way as to nake him believe that she had destroyed herself,!" said Malak. "I should not shed many tears to her memory if she had done so!" replied Sir Henry, bitterly. And then dismissing the at- tendants, he entered into conversation with the Jew regarding his late success, and the division of the booty last gained, And again he produced some valuable jewels, which he had saved from the common stock, unknown to his officers and men; for he knew well that if he shared all his booty with his crews and with his king, his chances of   independence at an early day would be slim indeed. "Whither wilt thou next turn thy prow, Sir Henry?" asked the Jew. "Is thy desti- nation to Panama?" "No," replied the admiral. "I must defer that venture until I can so increase my force aswto be sure of success; and by so doing I can also lull the Spaniards into a sense of security, while I strike a blow at them else- where. The fame of this last action will soon draw more men- and ships to my flag, and I need recruits, for the Spaniards of Puerto Bello fought but too well, and slew many of my best and bravest men! But thou andall others will never know where I mean to strike until the blow falls. Secrecy alone will se- cure success, for a town so well prepared to receive me as was Puerto Bello, costs too much blood for too little treasure. I shall rest until my men have spent their money and my ships been refitted, and again take the water. Doubtless ships will soon be sent from Spain to attempt to destroy my fleet, and protect their islands and coasts, and I must work rapidly; for well I know that soon a hue and cry will be raised by other nations, which may force the king to recall mpe." "I have thought such might be the case," said Solopon. "But the king is reckless and avaricious, crafty and cunning, and will delay such a course as long as he can with safety." i"True. But I have forgotten to ask after thy lovely daughter. Is she in health?" "She is, Sir Heryv, and was much rejoiced to receive news from thy fair betrothed. But,' strange girl that she is, she grieves much over the manner in which thou art acquiring money for thyself, as well as we. Many a tear rolls from her dark eyes as' she speaks of gold crimsoned by human life." "She weeps unnecessarily; for the Span- iards are but receiving the reward of their cruelty to a race that never harmed them, whom they have robbed of lands and gold, and whom they now treat more cruelly than they do their beasts of burthen. Were thy fair child to see the down-trodden Indians, she would weep for them, and not their perse- cutors! But I forgot that the governor made another vow to remain without food and wine until I go to join him; and he may famish be- fore I go to his aid."       , And Sir Henry hurried away to the gov- ernment house, where he found that the gov- ernor had broken his vow as before, and was busily occupied with another cold capon and a " thimbleful of punch."  He also was anxious to learn the destination which Morgan had laid out for his next foray, but received no further information than that which had been gained by Solomon. But when Morgan described his losses at Puerto   Bello, and the desperation of the Spanish de- fence, the governor was amazed; for he had despised the Spaniards as the most cowardly and treacherous race of men on earth. And not without reason, for their very wealth had enervated them until they were sunk, as they are now, in indolence, with nothing but beg- garly pride to sustain them. CHAPTER LX. In a few days the lavish expenditures of the crews belonging to Sir Henry's fleet, re- duced them to poverty once more, and again they clamored to be led to action. For, like ferocious beasts who have had a taste of blood, they longed for more, and such was their pas- sion for plunder now thoroughly aroused, that they cared not for peril, hardship, or suffering, so long as their toils were rewarded by booty. Sir Henry's fame was spread abroad fully as widely as he wished, and adventurers rapidly flocked to his standard. Men of all nations, but more particularly of French and English, composed his force; but the French were not so subordinate as he desired, and, moreover, those who had been with him on his late ex- pedition were dissatisfied with the share of the booty accounted for, and delivered to them. "Had I but men enough from England or Wales, I should refuse to have a Frenchman in my company," said Sir Henry to the gov- ernor, when complaining of their conduct. "What can be expected of men that had rather eat frogs than roast-beef, and drink sour wine while they sell us all the brandy they make?" said the governor, scornfully. "For my part, I never can look at one of tie hairy-faced clan without feeling an inclination to tlrash him soundly. But as they have ships and arms, I see not why thou shouldst be backward in using them; for they are as good food for powder as other and better men." "Tree-and as long as they last they fight well: but they have not the stamina to stand a long bout." While Sir Henry was speaking the sound of cannonry was heard in the harbor, and on in- quiry he learned that a larger French ship- larger than either of his own vessels, had just entered the port, and was firing a salute. Manned with over three hundred men, and mounting thirty heavy guns; she was an ad-  dition to his force not to be despised, and he at once endeavored to enlist her in his cause. f But to his utter surprise and great disappoint-  ment, her captain, who had heard the com- plaints of his countrymen also that Spain had sent a heavy force to guard her coasts, convoy her ships, and destroy the fleet of i Morgan, whom they regarded as a pirate with- i out the pale'of National law, and did not like I   to enlist where hard knocks and less pri e- money might be expected. "I must have that ship let it cost as it may!" said Sir Henry to the governor, after the refusal of her captain to join him. "Then it must be done by some strata- em!" replied Sir Simon. " or our country is yet at peace with France, and the king of England cannot afford to quarrel with her and Spain together. And were we so to act as to bring on such a quarrel, it would cost our positions-perchance our heads. Per. chance we can so inveigle the Frenchman, by kind treatment, as to induce him ifto our service for a time; or if not, we can find some pretext to seize his vessel for acting contrary to law, and have the use of her for a season, while her captain and crew are awaiting the course of a suit. I will myself give a feast on board of my own new ship, and fear not but that some pretext shall be found which will justify me in ordering them to be detained for trial; and then I will man- age to spare men from my own garrisons to man her." Nothing could have suited Sir Henry bet- ter than this idea-for he longed once more to be afloat. The new ship which Sir Simon spoke of was one which lately arrived from Eng- land, which he had purchased to add to Mor- gan's strength; and though not so large as the French ship, yet was the largest of any beside in Morgan's fleet. Fortune favored the plan of the governor; for, after he had invited the French officers and crew to a feast, pretended to be given in their honor, a small ship, which Morgan had sent away after provisions to help to victual his fleet, came, and reported that this very vessel had boarded them at sea, and being short of provisions, had taken what they wanted, without having the honor to even pay for them. This decided the course of the governor, who, having caused the wine to be drugged which the Frenchmen were drink- ing--thus rendering them helpless -they were easily secured on the charge of piracy and robbery: a charge made as coolly, as if it came not from men who made pillage and rapine their business. The men having been secured, and a strong guard of English placed over them-to keep them prior to a committal to prison-the governor hastened to the shore to relate his success to Sir Henry, who, pretending to be much hurt with the refusal of the French to join him, had abstained from attending the banquet. But scarcely had the governor landed, when the ship which he so lately left blew up, with an explosion louder than thunder, which shook the entire city, and. filled every heart V   pith surprise and fea'. In a second, the whole o(f the ill-fated men-- prisoners and guard-were destroyed, not one being left to tell whether the explosion occurred by neci- dent or design-not one left to complain of injustice, or to claim the ship which had been their own. Though this was a heavy loss, Morgan made no scruple now to seize tie' French ship-for he caused it to be reported that the captain of her had purposely blown up the vessel of the governor; and what he did was by way of reprisal. The occurrence made some delay in his preparations; yet he was soon ready for another voyage, with a force of between five and six hundred men. The governor was very desirous to accom- pany him on his trip; but the admiral had more than one reason for advising him to re- main. Not the least of these was the fact, that, in his long cruises, his men were often straitened for provisions; and well he knew with what little patience the governor would endure any deprivation of that kind. Malak and Hamet both accompanied the admiral- for the latter proved fully as devoted as the former, and caused Sir Henry to bless the fond heart which had sent him such a valu- able servant. The renegade, Domingo, was still in his employ; and had proved himself so useful and faithful as a guide, that his services could not well be dispensed with. Scarce a port in all the Southern seas which he had not visit- ed in the line of trade; and though an ar- rant coward, as most boasters generally are, his cunning was great,'and his fidelity to a bad cause-insured by the undoubted fact, that if the Spaniards ever got him into their power, his death would be as certain as the manner of it would, probably, be cruel. For, in both of the expeditions, he had been rec- ognized, and his business known, and his un- enviable fame widespread CHAPTER LXI. Morgan steered far to the southward of his usual route on this occasion-forhe wished to touch a point, if possible, where the alarm of his actions had not yet reached; and, es- pecially, to avoid the Spanish fleet sent after him, until -he gained more strength of men and ships to cope with them. As usual, each of his captains had sealed orders, appointing a place of meeting, if they were separated by a storm, or inequality of sailing; but even that spot was not so near to his destined port of despoil as to give an idea, which could be taken advantage of by treachery among his own officers. To the surprise of his master, young Ha- met, if questioned, betrayed a surprising knowledge of those Southern coasts, and the   wealth of their towns, which he accounted for by saying, that his former master had told him what he knew of them, that he might be of more benefit to Sir Henry. i"Whither thinkest thou that we are bound P" he asked, one day, after they had been tread- ing southward and westward for some weeks- for the superior aptitude and' intelligence of the lad had so interested his master, that he spoke with him quite as freely as he did with any officer under his command. "To the Lake of Mnricaybo, kind master, where there are two wealthy towns-Maricay- bo and Gibraltar. Both were sacked years ago by Solonois, the Freneh terror of this coast; but have long since recovered their prosperity, and, doubtless, will yield a rich booty. But at the very entrance of the river leading thither is a strong fort, which com- mands the passage in and out, and it should be taken, if possible, before the cities are alarmed; and then advance and retreat will both be covered by its gu4s." "Thou dost speak withl the wisdom of an old soldier; but much should I like to know how. thou hast divined my dcstiiation-,for, since none are in hearing, I tell thee that thither sam I bound." "Because my former master told me that this was one of the spots he advised thee to visit, and there are none other so far to the southward." "True! Thou canst go, and send Captain Domingo to my presence-for I must ques- tion him now in regard to his knowledge of the place, and its port of entrance." Hamet left the admiral in his state-room, and hastened to obey the order; And soon the swarthy renegade was before his em- ployer. "What knowest thou of the port of Mari- caybo?" asked Sir Henry. "Hast over been there?" "Yes, noble admiral. I was a contraban- dista on the coast of Venezuela ere I had seen my eighteenth year." "Thou didst commence thy career early. But, tell me, if its port of entrance is safe for our largest ships!" "Without a norther should be blowing, it is, But once over the bar, a oastle can open a battery of thirty or forty guns, at scarce pistol-shot distance." "So have I heard ; yet Solonois passed it." "Not until he had taken the castle, and dismounted its guns. It has been rebuilt, and armed afresh. That I know full well-- for some five years ago I tried to pals it with only a little periagua. loaded with trifles, to please the fair senoras of the city; and, though under cover of darkness, the sentinels were so on the alert, that I was forced to put to sea, and find a safer market at Carraeas"   --         Sj , % AJ, *JU ALJVJJ "It is well! 'We are now, by my reckon. ing, within less than twenty hours' sail of the place, if this eastern wind still fills our can- ras. I shall endeavor to reach it in the night, so that we may land, and take their fori fore much alarm can br given, ButP shall take, whether it bt*'day or ni for full well I know that a Spanish fleet ison the coast; and I may need the fort to teach it a lesson of prudence, should it follow me too far " "I will not guarantee to carry the ships over the bar, in safety, in the dark," replied Domingo; " but I will place them in a cove, whence the crews can be landed safely to at- tack the fort at early dawn." "Do that; and thy reward, as hitherto, shall be commensurate with thy success! But, mark thee, not a word must pass thy lips regarding our destination. It is enough for my followers to go, when and where I lead! Enough, that when I have led the m to victory that they share the spoils, as well as they have shared the danger 1" And the admiral dismissed the man, whom he despised for his treachery to his people, as much as for his cowardice. But he was an unscrupulous tool, and as such was needed. After Sir Henry dismissed his pilot and Jguide, he caused hi ship to be hove to, while he sent for his vice-admiral, Brodely--to whom, as usual, he tave sealed orders, to be used in case of any fatality occurring to him- self. Then pressing sail, he stood boldly in for the coast; while the hearts of his officers and crews were gladdened by more than one well-known sign that they were approaching the land, and knew that soon they would be at their favorite work again. Already they had tired of so long a voy- age; and, as provisions and liquor began to be short, were in some dread of suffering from scarcity-for in those days, the Spaniards on those shores destroyed or hurried back all kinds of provisions - when the buccaneers were on their coasts-so as to starve out those they could not conquer otherwise. CHAPTER LXII. It was night when the fleet arrived off Ma- ricaybo; but as well might it have been day- light-for earth and water glittered under the resplendent light of a full moon, no cloud obscured a star, and the bleached canvas of the vessels looked as white in the moonlight as it would have done in the glare of noon- day. The Spaniards all too soon provedl that they, like those at Puerto Bello, had been forewarned of the coming of the buccaneers- for they waited not to ask the character of the vessels off their port, but at once opened fire upon them.   Domingo, faithful ,to his word, conducted the ships to a cove, where, partially sheltered from fire by a sand-bluff, the men could be landed in boats; and soon the rattle of their musketry, and their shouts of anger, replied to the sullen and heavy roar of the Spanish cannon. For well did Morgan know, it would be madness to try to force his way up the river, before the guns in the fort were si. leneed. His ships would have fared badly had he tried. Landing to lead his men in person, with Malak and Hamet by his side, andDomingo skulking here and there to preserve his precious carcass from the thick flying round-shot, which were poured from- the fort, he advanced to a position whence his best shooters could pick away the can- nonie s, as they worked at their guns, through the wide embrasures. But as fast as men went down behind those walls, others appeared to fill their places; and now, it was doubly evident, that an at- tack had been expected, or the force in the garrison would not have been so large. From morning until night the fight raged on, with immense loss to the Spaniards, and but slight to the forces of Sir Henry-for the latter were under tolerable cover, and cannon shots were not so accurate as their own musketry. For the Spaniards, with their guns always in one range, had to fire but a single shot for Mor- gan's men to know the range of gun, and so avoid it. Night came on, not so light as the previous had been-for the moon and stars were ob- scured by clouds. And as the darknesp came on, the firing from the fort suddenly ceased. "Their ammunition has given out-the day is our-own!" said Sir Henry. is I. think my noble master is in error!" re- plied Ham.'t, whose quick ear had caught the sound of many boats moving. up the river. Now that darkness can cover their movements, they have probably fled to some position, where they will try again to obstruct our passage to the town." "Perchance 'tis so 1" replied the admiral. "We soon will see." And he gave tie order to advance upon the fort in order and silence. Scaling ladders had been prepared during the dry'; but little, or, in truth, no need for their use was found. The portcullis was up, the drawhridge down, and the main gate of the fortress open before them. Not a sound of hostility met their ears-not even the groan of a wounded man; but there lay in a ghastly heap the dead, which those who had fed had not deemed worth carrying away. While Sir Henry was wondering what had caused the sudden desertion of a post so strong, his eye caught the glare of a burning   natch upon the ground; and, springing for- ward, he snatched it from the earth, and saw how well the Spaniards had laid a plot for the destruction of his forces. So far from being short of ammunition, the magazine, filled with tons of powder, was close at hand; and the timely discovery of the match alone saved him and his force from utter annihila- tion. For it communicated with a train which led to the verv heart of the magazine, which, had it reached, would have torn the fortress into fragments, and have ent all within it to eternity.  The Spaniards, m their sudden flight, had left not only arms and ammunition, but great stores of provision, which, to men exhausted with a day of hard fighting, were not unwel- eome. Sir Henry, after placing guards about the castle-determining to garrison it in his absence above-ordered his men to rest until morning, when he intended to bring his ships in over Ihe bar, and move up the river. lFor he felt little fear of those who would flee from so strong a fort, before so small a force as lis; -and felt confident that the reports of his previous actions had stricken them with terror. Morning came; and with their flags flying in triumph from every mast-while tl:e gups of the fort thundered a joyous and larmless salute--his crossed the bar, and he at 9nce Imoved up the river, leaving, as he supposed, a sufficient garrison in the fort, to hold it, al- though volunteers for that service were hard to find. They preferred to look for "beauty and booty" in the two thwns above. Moving up the glittering nd placid river, in that lovely tropio elime where birds, and flowers, and all things beautiful, met the eye on every hand, it seemed as if men could not be so demoniac as to be bent upon pillage and rapine, , But such wasi men's jiature then- how much it has improved in modern days, their frequent acts will show. Yet now they cloak their acts more than in tho-e ,days- cloak them with assumed morality, under what should be the sacred veil of religion- under a thousand shapes, which make their victims easy and numerous. But this Is wanderink from my story, which all too long, tires me if it doth not the reader. Up the beautiful river, ard into the glassy lake they moved; but neither a sound of welcome or of hostility reached their ears. The people had indeed fled away, not only from their forts, but from the city: for it is likely they remembered but to well the bar- brity of Solonois, ind dreaded a similar treat- sent from their new visitors. And all the more that their plot to destroy them had failed.  In al the city of Maricaybo, but one hu- man being could be found, (and he was an   idiot) who, to indulge the fancy of being the governor of. the deserted city, remained. But what moat excited the disappointment of Sir Henry and the rage of his men was, that the principal part of the movable wealth of the citizens had disappeared with them. Neither gold, or jewels, or plate, gladdened the eyes of the buccaneers; and ev n provisions were so scarce in the town, that they had to send to the castle below for stqorl. Learning through prisioners whom histmen found it the woods and mountains, that the principal inhabitants had fled to Oibialtar, the town above, Sir Henry determined to immediately move on and attack that; for as they, had carried muchl wealth with tih, m it was more than likely they would attempt to defend it. But, in the meantime, while preparing for that expedit on-which had to be made in boats and eanoes-he sent scouts out to the wood near by, to search for citizens who, not having time to fly so fir, had hidden them- selves nearer by. Guided by Douring and others who wished to escape torture or win re- ward, the search was all too successful. More than an hundred unfortunates were brought in, who, being held to ransom and unable yet to pay it, were exposed to the most cruel wrongs and insolences fro their disappointed cap- tors. Justice to the hero of this story de- manded that it should be recorded, that he, so far as he could, restrained the excess of his lawless men; and history tells of but one in- stance where he seemed to forget his arly teaching to be chivalrous to a woman, even if he was cruel to a man.' But of that here- after. Leaving a guard with his prisoners at Mari- aybo, the admiral moved upon Gibraltar- which, though not so famed for strength as its namesake in the Mediterranean, still made a 'brave defence 'The governor, here, was made of much-the same stuff as he at Puerto Bello-an old Castiliannoble, who had some of the courage of his ancestor, Roderigo the Cid, in his v.eins-,and after he had defended the town with his small,garrison, until most of the inhabitants had time to escape, he re- treated to an impregnable position on a mountain with his soldiers, and family, and thence sent messages of defiance to Morgan, who, learsing how diffiult it would be to reach him, attempted it not, but pursued the same course which he had done at laricaybo-send- ing out to search for those who had fled, and holding them as prisoners ultil they could procure a ransom from their hidden stores or elsewhere. And he further still threatened to destroy both towns by fire, if a heavy ran- som was not paid for them,; Thus far he had triumphed over every dif- ficulty, but a new and terrible danger menao- ed him. Three heavy ships from Spain, with   nearly treble his foree and guns, had arrived ill the mouth of the river, taken the fort by surprise, massaered his little garrison, and lay at anchor, ready to dispute his passage to sea. This news he received through a pompous anl most inpnltin- letter from Admiral Espin- osa, commanding the fleet, offerlng him a free passage to the sea, only on condition of deliv- ering all prisoners, all booty, and leaving the towns unscathed. For the first time in his ca- reer, Morgan deemed it necessary to bold-a council with his officers. Short of provisions, with no passage to gain the sea, but that so ob- structed, a less dauntless spirit than his would have despaired, afid accepted the offer of the Spaniard. ButMorgan, in calling the council, only wished to sound his men, to now how far he might depend upon tlem. For hope was not dead in his own heart, nor yet the desire and determination to retain the booty in his own hands already, and to save that which he ex- pected to acquire from the. ransom of his prisoners and the two towns. He spoke but few words, yet in those he asked his officers if they would give up what had been gained at so mueh risk and peril, and cost so many lives already, without- a blow. The ready answer was, that they would not, arid where he led, they still would follow, or where he *ommanlded, they would go. On hearing these cheering words, he in. stantly sent a message to Espinosa, defying his power to stop him, and vowing to burn the towns. and mete out death to his prison- era, if their ransoms were-not paid. Full as obstinate as himself, the Spanish admiral repled that he had been sen by his king to destroy him, or to drive him utterly from those seae, and he should do, if it cost both of the cities, and every prisoner in Mor- gans hands.         - Finding that his threats were of no avail, the English admiralprepared to attempt the passage to the sea,With what booty he had collected already:- ftr he knew that; without a gre-.ter store of provisions, he' could not long sustain himself in a country where all where deadly foes. : So he moved down the river to almostwithin -cannon shot of the fort and ships, haviag preiously prepared a fire- ship, so mounted with imitation cannon and stuffed figures of, men, that the Spaniards could not distinguish its character. Waiting for the wind and tide to serve, they moved in battle-order leStiet the Spanish ships, senfd- ing their fire vessel before, which, grappling with the admiral's own ship, set her on fire, and so alarmed the others, that they made for protection nearer the shore, and under the protection of the guns of the fort. Bt with a bold dash, some boats from Morgan's fleet boldly boarded the eeond4ized ship, and   tmanaged to get her up the river to the anehor- age which he had chosen. The Spanish ad. miral's ship was totally destroyed, but le and a portion of his crew managed to reach the fort, where he prepared to defend himself to the uttermost. The other Spanish ship was run' on shore and her captain fearing that the desperate freebooters would capture her, set her on fire; and thus, had not the fort been there, the passage would have been free for Morgan to the sea. But Espinosa, maddened by his losses, and the irretrvable disgrace which they would fasten upon him, swrre that in that fort he would find his grave, or stop the passage of the buccaneers. Morgan, un- willing to lose more men, vowed to hang every prisoner he had to the yard-arms, un- less allowed a free passage. He even sent a deputation of them to the Spanish admiral, who now took command df she. castle, to beg that they might be spared from the dreaded alternative Which Morgan offered. But the admiral was firm as a rock. "Had ye been loyal as I have been, the towns ye dwell in had not been taken, and ye live to mourn over it. Had ye stood like men in defence of homes and property, this hand. ful of pirates would not have put us to shame. But ye fled as cowards, and the coward's fate besuits ye I Begone, and tell Sir Henry Mor- gar to hang ye as quick as he likes. that he tmay have more leisure to one who neither asks nor will grant quarter!" For a time after Sir Henry received this message,-the good and bad qualities of his na- ture severely struggled for the ascendency. The bad bade him wreak his vengeance and hatred on people already unfortunate and mis- erable from his acts. The good bade him spare them, And at the instance of Hamet, he adopted a plan whereby he might do so, and yet escape to the s a in safety, which was all that he then desired. During the restlof the day, men were land- ed from his boats in the forest to the west of the castle. The boats carrying a full load of men would be rowed to the shore, there, dis- appearing under the overhanging bushes, they would O:use their men, who appeared to land, to lie down in thebottom of the boats, and' thus they returne - to the side of the vessels opposite the fort unseen. By this ma- nceuvre, Espiinosawas induced to believe that in the night they would attempt to attack the fort from the landward side; and as his can- non had been mounted t act on the river only, he moved them to the other side for its defence. Satisfied that this had been done, Morgan after dark quietly slipped hii cables, and without making sai, allowed his vessels to float with the current toward the sea. By this bold, yet ingenious device, he wa able to pass the fort before he was discovered, and   thrs once more to reach the -open sea.' But his generosity did not cease here, for without ransom he sent his prisoners on shore in the same cove where he had first landed, and per- mitted them to return to their half-desolated homes. This had been the least fortunate of his ex,- peditious, yet he had made considerable booty-enough to induce him to repair once more to Jamaica and rest his men, while he refitted for another and the most desperate of his undertakings-an adventure the history of which will live as long as a stone of Castle Chagres remains, or a spire is seen in the once. grand, but now pitiful city of Panama. And thus prefacing the history of his expeditioh thither, m e will for a moment look in that di- rection ourselves to see what has become of some of the actors in our drama-or tragedy, if the term suits better. CHAPTER LXIII. By especial request of the Governor at Pan- ama, Lprd Percival and his friend, "Hon st George"Brompton, remained at Panama after their arrival; to aid him in preparing fortifica- tions to repel the dreaded buccaneers, and to drill his troops-for Percival was not without experience as a soldier, while Brompton made quite an efficient aid-at least in the eyes of the Spaniards, who believed the English in- vincible if they were not immortal. Lady Helen remained with the Seiiora- Farrago, for she had learned but too truly while in-the serv- ice and full confidence of Sir Henry, that the crowning effort of all his enterprises would be;t capture that city, and to seize its im- mense wealth. When the news reached Pnn- ara of the capture of the -places which we have already noted, she warned the governor that his nexbt effort would be there ; and if he would defeat it, he nust take more pains than to have his garrison oftwo or three thousand men drilled at home-that he had far better met so terrible an enemy half-way than to wait for him at his very threshold. The gov- ernor, who little dreamed that men unused to the' country woulddare to travel a journey occupying from six to eight days up a rapid river, through- wild morasses, and dark and fearful ravines, probably without guides and no chance of provisions by the way, scorned all advice which would tend to his own incon- * venience, or the discomfort of his favorite officers. Yet wearied by many importunities, he at last consented to reinforce the Castle at Chagrie, so as to offer a strong resistance there if Morgan should indeed lanLd While these slight preparations were being made, the bold hiefthe busaeee       s M di strongly preparing for Ith ib l beforme sm, which h knew woue ldrtef in thE complete success of his hopes or his ruin.

To sur. prise the island of SaiintCatherine' s ith a not Jarge garrison, and no wealth. to require the protection of one, was not a difficult job, and it was soon accomplished, and his rendezvous here formed to receive recruits of vessels and men. The instant he. took the place, he sent Brodely with three hundred chosen men to secure thi, Castle at Chagres, and-to cut off all communication between that place and Pana- ma, while he prepared to follow with his main body as speedily s possible. Right galantly-if gallantry can be spoken of in so bad a cause-did Brodely execute his mission. Yet not without fearful loss on his own side, and the entire destruction of the doubled garrison in. the fort, who perched to a man rather, than surrunder. Sending a vessel instantly to Morgan with the news od his suofsa, Brodely refitted the nearly-de. stroyed,satleas quickly as he could, and anx- iously awaited the arrival of his chief* Morgan soon came with a heavier force than he had ever commanded in those seas. After garrisoning the fort. he had yet leff t,;eyv hundred men to undertake his enterprise. With many a cheer fromn the garrison, and many an answering shout from his boatq, the admiral left for his perilous undertaking, But little dreamed he of the difficulties before him. Not wishing to stint the garrison in food, and being toldthat the, Spaniards were waiting in ambuscadee before hmu, he depend- ed on not only defeating the latter, but f procuring provsions from their etrea when they had. And his guides had spoken of In- dian settlements O the' route where food might be had. Moreover, neither he nor they had taken into proper account the difficulties of the rainy seson which had set in, making travel difficult, and lrduing sickness among bb-lomsv  It is rather the part of the historian than the novelest -to deseribe that fearful route. For three days, his men cramped up in small   boats, strtngglednupia rapid streamfilled with drifting trees. And so weakened by.-want of food were they when they landed for their march, that leathern skins and cast-off shoes were treated as luxuries, and stewed into broths-to sustain strength and life. Met by frequent harrassing amn6eoades, where their fbe swotld fire a volley and fly from their reach, it is wonderful how they could endure for seven terrible days the hardships they did. Yet, on the seventh day, they came in sight of the Pacific Ocean, And of that city which they had striven to reach. Beholding herds of cattle and mules on a plain near to them, they rushed like fapfished madmen, as they were, among them, and slew and ate the un- cooked meat. Then, worn down with fatigue, they cast themselves upon the earth, and slept, while the brave governor in the city opened a die- tant cannonade on those whomihe might then have destroyed, with half their number of men. In vain did Sir Henry, and such of his officers as had any moral forte left in them- not to speak of physical ability-s-trive to form a guard to wateh over their temporary camp. Yet such effortsa proved unnecessary; for no enemy" approached them, and they slept as sound in life, aa many of them were destined to sleep in death before the set of another day's sun. Yet some there werewho could not sleep, or would not. Among; these was' the leader of those meit, who knew that the goal of his ambition was'close before him, yet far from being obtained, with a force so utterly worn down by privation and fatigue. Atded by his two faithful servants, he strofal  on in the darkness, far iti advance of his sleeping force, Judeled by a desire to look as nearly as possible on the city of his hopes before he entered on his last struggle. Suddetly he came upon a single horseman, who, riling from the opposite direction, seemed to be endeavoring to spy out his po- sitioe. "* Whe-ecies there ." he asked, And his hand was on his sword, for he knew not how many might ride behind the first homer. a "One' who welcomes thee itw Panasia a" cried the' ider. "One who bath woven thy shroud from the webs of her' oWn darkened fate H "Hele  of 'Caermarthen it is 'thee!" said Sir Heiryj as hee'ognizse:her &ro ic: "Ay, wronged andr iespised, but notpower- lesi.

Yet while he spoke, he advanced closer still to the spot where she had halted, intending to make her his prisoner. But, in a moment, her horse bounded back, as if touched by a spur, and she cried: "Not to-night, Sir Henry! Shouldst thou seek my \acquaintance to-morrow, I shall, perchance, not be so backward-for a thou. sand armed men will follow where I lead. Look to thyself well, for a woman's hand may avenge her wrongs!" "Thou hast wronged thyself more than thou hast my master!" said Hamet, in a tone so sharp and bitter, and so different from his usual tone, that Sir Henry was not sure who it was that spoke. 1"Who art thou that speakest with a voice so strong, after a fast of such length?" asked Lady Helen, tauntingly. "That I will tell thee on'the morrow, when the Amazonian leader heads her thousand men-fitting men they must be, indeed, to choose thee to lead them to their death!" "I will take thee at thy word, whoever thou art, and there is my gage t"And Lady Helen cast from her head a plumed helmet, so near the feet of Hamet, that even in the darkness, he was enabled to discover and pick it up - Then, without speaking further, she rode hastily away; and Sir Henry retraced his steps to his camp, lest more dangerous visit. ors should cross his steps unawares. ,And, as he walked along, strange thoughts entered his mind-for the voice of Ilamet eso altered, and the. challenge so strangely given and accepted, troubled him. He began to think that the boy was not what he purported to be; and when they got to a hut, where he had taken his temporary quarters, he turned to question him. But both Malak and Hamet had disappeared; and though he called them by name, no answer came to his ear. And wondering what on earth could induce them so suddenly to leave-yet not doubting their faith, he cast himself upon the earth; and, in his exhaustion of mind and body, sunk to slumber. CIAPTER LXIV. It was morning when he awoke, and sprung to his feet. Masak was standing by the door of the iutiind had,;as usual, evidently been guarding his slumbers Hamnirt was not near. But tsh  young admiral thought of nothing t b-ttheligh t before him, as he gazed upon   the city, not more than three miles distant. The sun of a cloudless day, just risen, glit- tered on many a gilded dome-on many a lofty spire-in the city of boundless wealth. Before its walls, he could see an immense gathering of men, whose armn shone like glittering silver in the' sun; but little cared he for them, when he looked on his own band, refreshed by rest and sleep, and now calmly gathered about their camp-fires, cooking and eating the food which had been spared from , the previous night, showing no concern for the fate of the day before them. Some, whose appetites had been already satisfied, were quietly looking to their trma, and all seemed as if ready for the terrible, work before them. It scarcely seems possible that men, with a little rest and refreshment, can ,recover from i; such fatigue in so brief a time; yet, when I they have the object of long-deferred hopes in view, it gives a moral strength, which con- quers all physical weakness, Morgan looked forth on his band, felt that he could 'depend upon them, and that the city would be his own before the set of sun. And he smiled, as he looked on the glittering displaif]beforet the walls of the town, which, despite their numbers, waited for his attack-smiled, while he contrasted his own ;sun-burned, roughly- clad, but well-armed men with them-smiled, while' he listened to the rolling drums and shrill bugle-notes which reached his ear from. the city, and thought how quickly the savage ehouts of his wild desperadoes would drown suoh sounds. Such time was taken for refreshment as himself and men needed; and then Sir Henry, mounting a horse, which some of his men had eaptured, proceeded to arrange his force for action. With a brief address, he first ha- rangued them, as they gathered around, point- ing to the certainty of no quarter being granted, if they were defeated, and the neces- sity of standing side by side till they fell or conquered. He formed his men in his favor- ite way, in a crescent, with the two first ranks composed of his best marksmen, and ad- vanced. As he moved forward in the centre, he was surprised, but not displeased, to see a horse- man, with a plumed' helmet on his head, whom he recognized, by his form, as Hamet, though he rode so far on his right'that he did not recognize his face. The enemy, seeing that the buccaneers were advancing, now moved forward with a large body of lancers, while in their rear was a body of three 'or four thousand infantry. As the space decreased between the laneers and the buccaneers, the formerincreased their speed, and came dashing on in a mannerwhich would seem to show that no footmen could   withstand them. But Morgan, when scares a hundred yards -intetivened between [the bodies, halted his men, and while the front rank knelt and' poured in its deadly fire, the second rank waited for the confusion which was sure to follow that well-aimed volley, to pour in another which would be sure to cheek the charge.. Every shot, given with steadi- ness and precision, told: and in a few mo- ments the lancers, in spite of some officers who tried to ve-form them, were flying back upon their own infantry in unutterable confu- sion. At least so, many as could leave the field: for a terrible'swarth of dead anddying men lay before the .buecaneers, who, with loud shouts, now ruseed to the charge, for they had lost no men, and were exultant in their first success. ,But one ,of the leading officers of the Ian- eers,. apparently their chief, after in vain try- ing to rally his men, turned in pparent des- peration to, face alone the terrible phalanx which rushed toward him. An4 as he did so, tamet driving theo spurs into his horse, with the speed of an arrow, shot forward in advance of the line, for he eeemed intuitivey- to recognize the one who had cast the plumed helmet, which'he wore, at his feet. !"Hold, Hamnet,- strike not a woman!' shouted Sir Henry, as he rode forward, far ahead of his men. "It is woman to woman, sir knight--let our swords meet!" cried Helen of Caermarthen, "Dost thou think I did not recognize her voice last night? I did, and hence my challenge, First her, and then thee!" And while yet she spoke, the woman, with a', skill that told of long practice, not only threw up the blade which her first oponent aimed at her breast, but with her blow dashed the sword from!her hIand. Well it was that Sir Henrymwas so near, else had that moment been, the last for her who, amid all his wilder pas- sions, had held possession of his heart. For he had but time to ward a blow from, her heart, when her horse stumbled and fell, and. the helmet unclasping, revealed, not the face of the supposed Hamet, butthatiof Coraline. "Farewell, sir knight: I wish thee joy of. thy leman, untilwe meet again " cried the Lady Helen, and turning her steed, she fled. fast away; while Sir Henryisprang from his horse and lifted the fallen lady back to, her: saddle, ere his men reached the spot "For the love .of -me dear lady, retira to, the rear, and remain in charge of Malak, until; this fray is over," said the knight. '"Not so, Sir Henry!" said the lady, as she readjusted her/helmet, and closed the visor over her face one more. "I crossed the sea to be near thee in the hour of danger. o of death. I will not leave thee now."   i And gathering'her reins, she rode on as firml as before, whilenot a man but him wh rode by her side would inupeot her sex frons her bearing. The -8panies infantry, as if confident of enceess, 'fromi ther overhelming numbers, yet stood firm; and while the lancer partial- ly re-formed in'their rear, poured in a volley, which braught more than one of Morgan's men to the dust. But without  pause, the desperate men rushedon at a run, and in a few seeondb met their foemen hand to hand.

But that day and another night passed with. out'hearing of her safety, or aught concern- ing her., eantime, among many prisoners brought in, were the Senor Farrago and his lovely lady, Dona Anita. Knowing well that they had been participants in the flight of Lady Helen,  organ, in his despair, used every threat to make them disclose the hiding place of those whom he supposed to be the only ones who would strive to wrench his be- trothed from his aide. -But they solemnly protested, and even swore on the crucifix that they knew not where the Lady Helen or Percival were-that they hid not seen them since the capture of the 'ity, mnd Sir Henry was forced to believe  them. Yet, knowing theirwealth, and because of their tesape from his power before, he de- manded of them, as he did of others who were -rioh, the iheaviest ransom that they could affird. Meantime his men were busy in find- inghidden treasure, nor were they scrupulous as to the means they took of finding it. Pris. onier were tortred, and cruelly abused, and' many a one perished because could not or rould not reveal where treasure was concealed. To add to the .misery of the people, a fire broke out, which was either purposely set by the pirate s or else the result of earelessness; and in the course of three or four days, so nearly destroyed the town, as to force the buccaneers to camp in the open fields. Having now gathered an immense deal ot treasure-far more than his mos ardent ex- pectations had pictured, and also produced a searcity of provisions, Sir Henry resolved to return to Chagres, and leave forever ,business o full of horrors. Having announced this, mi declared he would earry every unransom- ed prisoner to Jamaica, he prepared to return in a ir different plight from that in which he cames Though he had lost many men in the battle, and yet more by disease, consequent on their sulaseqlemnt excesses, Iis force was still over eight hundred men fit for duty.

When Sir Henry, yet grieving for the un- accountable absence of Coraline, began in- e)to feel that she was lost to him forever, began to prepare for his homeward journey, a messenger put into his hands a package which contained these words of mockery: "Sir Henry Morgan, while he glories in his robber- ies, and his murders, in the destruction of a thousand homes, and in the possession of bloodstained gold, will yet remember that he ha left hs brightest Jewel in the hands of her foe and his; And let him yet tremble, even when he stands on Rngland's soil; for as the brow of Cain was marked, so is his, aid the bate of Helen of Caermarthen will follow him to his grave. Think not to escape because thou hast so far triumphed in thy aims!" He was so struck with the cruelty of the letter, that for a moment he forgot to ques- tion the messenger, or even to take a second glance at him, by which he might yet be known, captured, and forced to reveal where she was who gave to him the package. But a keener eye than his had looked upon the messenger, a sure foot was on his track. It was that of Malak. And now we will go back to a date a few days earlier, when Coraline entering the city, amid a crowd of fugitives, found herself sud- denly pushed into a street or alley, which separated her from Sir Henry and his force, and torn so suddenly from her house by the strong arms of a man, whom she knew but too well, for it was Pereival. The act was done so quickly that she had not time to resist, and ere she could cry aloud-if indeed her voice could have reached the ears of any with power or will to help her-she was borne into a dark passage, and down into a damp and noisome cell, which seemed to be far beneath the sur- face of the earth. Here, cast brutally to the ground, her abductor, without even speaking, left her in the darkness and gloom, and the clang of an iron door behind him told her that she was helpless and a prisoner. ' The place was chilly as a tomb, and not even the sound of the carnage then going on in the city could reach her ear. Brave as she was at heart, herspirit sunk in terror; for she felt little hope of kindness from either Perci- val or Helen of Caermarthen. For hours she lay in the dark and chilling spot, but at last she heard sounds of some one unbarring the door. Staggering to her feet, ahe looked to see who entered, fo a blinding blase of light told her they bore a torch; and their low-toned voices, that there were more than one. And all toosodn:she recognized the mocking tones of Helen of Carnarthen. "We have quickly met again I' cried the latter. "But it will be long ere we part, or thou hast a chance to leave these comfortable quarters!"  "Make not too sure of that!" replied Cora- line, boldly. "He who ere this' s master of   this town, will leave no stone unturned to find me!" "He will have to dig deep th find thee un- der the-funeral vaults of Santa Theresa? 'Tie a fitting place for one who shall never see the light of day again. But think not thou art to die at once. I will not rob myself of the pleasure oftormenting thee. I have brought thee bread and water-a fitting diet for one who will take but little exercise " Percival, who had acconmpanied Lady Helen, bearing the torch, set down the food, and, re- marked that the torch they left would last long enough for her to see what a magnificent palace they had chosen for her future resi- dence. Coraline replied not to his sneering words, but felt, with a sigh, for the weapon of which she had been deprived. For gladly would she have stricken it through his base and coward- ly heart. He smiled sardonically, and said: *' Edged tools are dangerous sometimes, even in a woman's hand. Tears are her best wea- pon i" "Thou wilt never see them flowing from my eyes! Tears best become so base a cow- ard as thou hast ever been!" A bitter curse from his lips justified her words, and a blow would have followed it,-had not even so bitter a foe as Lady Helen was to her, restrained him with a rebuke. And then they left her alone. Now she glanced around her dismal prison-house, and she found that the vault she was in had been once used as a charnel house; for many a niche in its black and lofty sides yet contained crumbling coffins, and more than one ghastly skull upon the ground, and other' bones, told the sad story of departed humanity.' But not at these did she look and shudder, as she wan- dered with the torch in her hand around by its gloomy walls. It was, that nowhere could she see the least sign of an avenue of escape. The door was of solid iron: Not a spot re. vealed its light to show how air was ever ad- mitted. It was terrible -the thought that with no human help, for her foes could not be classed as human, she must perish 'there, after, perchance, long months oftorment and suffering. She would hanv wept, had tears been ne- cessary for a relief; but where misery ie deep, how well I know they will not flow; and if they should, they are like gall from a crushed heart.  Days passed, and each one was but a repe- tition of the first. Woin down by suffering, for the bare, damp ground was her couch, poor Coraline seemed nearher death. Yet the hearts of her persecutors had no mercy. At times she partook of the coarse food they brought her, or the hope of rescue was not quite dead in i   her heart. But at last she: lay .down with a wish to die. With a murmured prayer for him who, with all his faults; had won her vir- gin heart, she closed her weary eyes, nor cared ever to open them again. Even when she heard her prison doors unbarred, she did not rise to listen; to She taunt. phe no longer had the spirit to repel; but wheb she ieard a wild cry of joy, from the well-known voice of Ma. lak, she staggered to her feet, and fell insensi- Wbe in, his strong aims. When next she knew that she yet lived, the cool air of a night-breeze was fanning her brow, and oh. heprd ihe rustle of orange leaves above her, the rull of a gurgling brook close by, and looking up above the golden fruit, she could see twinkling stars, and feel once more that she was free. And bending over her, pressing water to her lips, sad bathing her brow with his tawny, but honest hand, was Malak. "Where am I?" she asked, in a voiee half of hope, yet tinged with fear. "Free, sweet lady, and on thy way to my rnaster, if we can escape the cruel foe$ who tore thee from his side. His heart, half wild with grief, will spring into new life, for he mourned thee as lost to him foreverl" "Where is he now? Oh, take me to him quickly!" "Alas, my lady, he is miles hence, on his way to CIagres. After getting a clue to thy fate, I had to wait and watch long before I could aid thee; bnt at last I got the key to thy prison, and found thee. But I Muistspeed- )n, the city gates no longer stand, but yet we I'iay be met by some who will strive to detain ius. I must be miles iaence before the morn- iug dawns; f6r, if thy foes should get upon our track, with revengeful Spaniards to aid them, our doom would be swift and sure!' "Move on, then, good Malak; I am stronger now, and "ill run by ,thy side, as oft I did when I was .4 gleeful child!" And the poor girl strove to rise; but, weak sos an infant, she could n.'t. "&1 is. dear lady, thine has been most cruel tatnet,lt!" eaid Malak, almost weeping in his pity. And he took her wasted form up in his strong arms, and bore her away as rapilly as he could. "If I can but get a borse," said he, " we will not be long in reaching him whose power is strong enough to protect us "' CHAPTER LXVI. Morgan had arrived at Cbogres onqe more, and again stood in the great asbin of his good ship. In this he was walking to and fro, chafing like an angry lion.- Never had he been so tyrannical to his men oa on this their return trip from Panama, Mrll way down   he had caused every man of his company to be searched, Itest they had eoncealed valuable jewels on their persons, which belonged in the general booty. This, to the excitpble Flreneh, of whom some were yet in his com- mand, was most galling, and they, with some of his best men, were nearly in a state of mutiny. Had they but understood the state of his mind-- how nearly distracted he was vith grief for the loss of her for whom he had risked so much-they might have been more lenient in their then judgment and after re- cords of his acts. Most who have touched upon his history, report, that with unchaste intentions he had detained the Sefiora Far. rago. Yet, without a ransom, that lady, whose unsurpassed beauty had awakened his wildest passions, was set free, as pure and good as when She fell into hip hands. This stamps the falsehood on the lips of those who wuld make him appear as; utterly heattless and dissolute. He was now ready to sail. But Malak, ever faithful, had disappeared, his Coraline ,H as behind; and how, with all his boundless wealth, could he face her fathier- the benefactor whose uncalled-for generosity had raised him from obscurity to what he Wih the sails of his vessel loosed, the tide favoring for sea, and the men impatient to be off for Jamaica, he still hesitated to have the signal made for sailing. Hisi chief officer more than once came in to tell him that the commanders of the other ships could scaree restrain their crews-that fever and sickness was carrying off the men. "Let them who choose depart, and those who must diei die!" was his answer. "I am not yet ready to go! The main booty we have taken is in the magazine beneath my feet; and before I am forced, against my will, to leave my anchorage, it and all who oppose me shl mount nearer to heaven with their bodies than their spirits ever afterward can get "               % From this we can see that he yet had hope; and that, perchance, that unsedoen, not known- how-derived, yet surely-felt inspiration which links some souls together, bound him to his belief that yet his lost one would come to him. His first officer came at last to say that two of the French vessels had departed, vowing, that if they met him on the sea, they would' wrest all the booty from him, or sink by his side. "It, is welU the craven omutineers have gone!" wae his ' calm reply. They miuht else have sunk, ore 'they reached blue water. But 1 pray thee to look shoreward often, for I doubt; not thou wi'ltsoon see that which will soon deide i y action. rTell me if any -V   canoe or boat approaches from the west- ward!" The officer returned to the deck with these offices, but quickly came baek to report that a small canoe, with a man paddling in its stern, and a tiny sail set to aid its speed, was in sight up the river. "But," he added, "she must be one of our enemies, for a barge filled with men is in pursuit of her, firing upon her as they come!" "Fool! In that canoe, my heart telleth me that there is one worth all the booty in our ships. Quick, man my barge-man every boat in the ship with armed men! Quick I 1 will myself lead to the rescue!" And the admiral, generally so calm and lull of dignity in his orders, seized his sword from the table before him, and without so much as putting on his hat, rushed to the deck, where, at a glance, he saw the truth of his offier'l report. "Signal to the castle to fire upon the barge!" he cried, forgetting already that the enstle had been utterly dismantled by his orders. In, a few seconds several boats from his ship were manned; and springing into the first, he bade the men row for their lives, while he took the helm and guided her up the turbid river. The crew thought him in- sane or inebriated, yet they obeyed his or- ders. The distance between him and the canoe rapidly decreased ; but as he stood up, he saw, in his agony, that the barge was still nearer. A shot from a petronel or swivel in the bow ot the barge had cut down the tiny mast of the canoe, and only the one paddle in her stern urged her on. And now, by his white turban, he recognized that paddler as Malak, and his heart divined from whom he fled, and that another in the tiny bark could not but be she for whom his heart had mourned so fervently. To lose a loved one at all is madness-but to lose one so near to safety were worse, if worsi can bet. The banre was alm6st up to the canoe, the boat of Morgan yet a hundred yards away, when Matak rose, and the flash of a weapon in his hand, and its effect, for a moment ehecked 'the barge. Sir Henry, yet urging on his men, eized a musket from a thwart and fi'ed a Uot, which produced yet more confusion in the barge, for a wostian's shriek rung loud upon the air, even as if it were her death-cry. And back from the barge came a volley, which seemed to have poured death into the canoe as well as into Morgan's boat. For Sir Henry saw that Malak was down-he no longer saw the form of Coraline; and as his boat still dashed on with her own head- way, he saw that many an niphanded oar loated off into her wake.   But this, its sights and thoughts, were those of a moment; for the next instant the -boat and barge crashed side against side, and Sir Henry, with few to follow him, sprang amid her crew, composed mostly of Spaniards. But one he recognized there, who, once be- fore spared,0could expect no mercy now. It was Percival. With a wild cry of rage, the admiral drove down his feeble guard, and the next instant his heavy blade crashed through his brain. Brompton next met his eye, and in another moment his spirit fled to seek its master's soul in Hades. The Spaniards terrified, fell back, and cast- ing down their arms, cried for quarter. But shrill and clear above their cries rose one of defiance. It was from the lips of Helen of Caermarthen, who, with her own hand, had guided the pursuing barge. "Sir Henry, thy work is not all done! Strike home to this heart!" she cried. He glanced at her-saw from her pale lips and paler cheek that she was dying--for the red blood gushed in a torrent from her side. "Even if I have lost all that is dear tomroe, in this hour I forgive thee, lady!" he -said- for who that had a heart could be relentless then?               I "Ah-is she dead? Then to another world I go, for hate dieth not here!" shrieked the dying girl. She spoke no more--life had ebbed away with her last words. And iow Morgan, joined by his other boats, turned to look for Malak and Coraline. Float- ing close at hand was the canoe-stretched at full length in its bottom lay the faithful negro. One glance told the admiral that death's seal was on his brow-yet life enough for a single word was left. "Here, master, here! Malak hath done his duty, and must go to sleep l' gasped the true brave, and he tried to rise. Sir Henry then saw what' had been his de- votion. Even while the death eshot rent its cruel pathway through his vitals, he had cast himself forward to shield the life of his loved mistress. And as the knight lifted the faithful servant with his own hands into the barge, Coraline, unharmed, but weak, and showing sad tokens of her great suffering, struggled to rise. Quickly did Sir Henry raise her to his arms, thenturned once more to look on him who saved her, before he could speak his joy. The stony gaze of death only met his eye-- Malak was gone to the slirit-land. Back to his vessel, yet holding his treasure to his breast, Sir Henry went, leaving the Spaniards free to dispose of their dead as they chose; and within an hour thereafter his sails were spread to the. breeze, and his ehips once more ploughing the blue ocean.   CHAPTER LXVII. Away from that coast they sped; and now Sir Henry, by the side of his Coraline-who had removed the stains from her lovely face, and appeared again in the habiliments of her sex-began to look forward to the realization of his hopes of future joy, and tried to forget how crimsoned was the iold which he had won. Away over that wild Carribean sea, so full of ree, and rocks, and shoals, with the thought that, danger-free, he would soon stand on England's soil, there to ask from his mon- arch the favor which would end his task, and give Coraline completely to his heart. But scarce- had they lost sight of the treacherous coast, on which the wreck of many a gallant bark bath been laid, when the first officer came to Sir Henry with the impress of unpleasant news upon his fiae. Wishing not to cloud the face of her whom  he so loved, he arose, and making a sign for the officer to withhold his message, whatever it might be, he accompanied him to the deck. And there he saw what no one could describe without having witnessed it, and that which no one, having seen, will ever forget. Though they were then many leagues from shore, the lofty-peaks of the inland mountains seemed but a few miles off, and to be lifted high in air, even above the usual altitude of the clouds. The atmosphere was cold and clear, the breeze yet from the westward light, but far away to the east and north was a long bank of clouds of a purplish black hue, which rose steadily and swiftly from the horizou. "Thou knowest well what to do!" said Sir Henry. "Trim the ship for a storm. Signal to every vessel to prepare for the norter  Lucky will be they who can work off the coast, if it cometh with its usual force!" The hoarse cries of the boatswain calling all hands to reduce sail, the busy orders of top-captains reeving mast-ropes, running out reef-tackles, and rigging in and sending down their spars, were heard on every hand. Pre- venter stays and braces below were set up and bent-extra tackles and lashings secured to the guns, hatches battened down, for well those knew who sailed those seas in the frail barks of that day, how to dread a norther in that sea or off that coast.  Even now, when ships are stout in hull and strongly rigged, the seaman dreads a norther more than all the hurricanes that sweep the Indian seas. Gazing intently upon the aspect of the storm-scaree heeding the noise and turmoil about him, Sir Henry stood, and not until a light touch was on his arm, did he know that he had been followed to the deck by Coraline. "Is it not grandly beautiful?" she said, s she pointed seaward. "Like all besittiful thins in Nature save   thee, loved one, most dangerous. But hase below!" he addled, " this iB-no place for thee!" For well he knew that more than one law- less eye, used to indulgence in their forays, would be gazing on her, and he could not but dread a glance like theirs shoulld fall on one so dear to him and pure as she. "If this is the post of danger, my place is by thy side! said she, with a quiet smile. "My presence here is not now necessary! I will go to the cabin with theel" said he. And giving a hurried order to his chief officer, he left the deck. Meanwhile the storm, rising almost with speed of thought, was bearing down upon them.. The officer in charge, who saw that all was not yet ready to meet it, dared not keep the vessel y the wind when he saw the rolling wall of waters, which told of the ter- rific force which raised them. To clew down and let run everything, and to put the helm up, dangerous as it wasto run toward an in- hospitable shore, was their only chance to avert instant destruction. The order was given and obeyed in time-no more-to save the heavy-laden craft from fearful peril-for if no worse had come, her masts would have gone in the strain. As it was, under but her spars; she almost buried under the first ter- rible gust, arid then sped away like a fright- ened bird before the gale. The darkness of the tempest shut the other vessels out of sight-no longer were the mountain-peaks in view. Yet the officers and crew knew all too well toward what peril they were scudding, for little mercy could a wrecked and helpless crew of buccaneers hope for from the Span- niards, whom they had so often wronged, if they fell in their power. And they looked aghast one at the other, as they saw death in either course they took. Then it was that Sir Henry, who so oft had led them, himself ever the foremost in tlh storm of battle, proved himself more a hero in battling with the elements than he ever had in war with the human kiad. By his anxious prayers, Coraline was induced to re- main below; and he, hastening to the deck, seized the trumpet, and calling to his men to be as fearless now as before they had been at his call, bade them haul down their mainsail, and to trim its sheets.  "We will rather give our bodies to the sea than to the Spaniards!" was his cry.  "Ay 1" answered every man. Again his role was strong as ever, and, with a will, they tugged at the strong ropes, and dragged down the almost bursting canvyas "Now to the braces-down with the helm I if she cannot bear the gale, the ship must carry us down with her!" Quiokly, under such speed, the brave bark   answered her helm. Around she came to face the mountain waves, while her mainsail, flat- tened to the wind, so forced her on her side, that half the force of the gale blew over rather than into it. But on and under the great waves she so plunged and strained that each moment it seemed as if her hull would part asunder or her spars go by/le board. Yet on, amid the darknesa tn e spray of the tempest she wallowed, like shme huge monster of life, groaning in its strife; and each hour the hearts of the crew grew lighter, because they now were receding from the dreaddd coast, and as well they knew the storm in its first fury had spent its fiercest force. Yet hours passed--log, weary hours-ere he, in whom they had the greatest trust, dared to leave the deck; but at last the gale began to break, the sun shone out amid the parting clouds, the great waves lost their vigor, and more sail was crowded on the noble craft to add to her speed and to steady her on the rolling billows. Then, and not until then, did the admiral go down to cheer one, for whose safety more than for all his treasures he had worked. But when the storm broke, not one of all the brave fleet which had left Chagres in his wake, or even before him, could be seen. Ei- ther they had foundered, or, less bold, had been driven back toward, perchance, the shores thev had left. But little reeked they who sailed in the ship which held the booty, how, many less there were left to share so rich a prize. For so used to bloodshed and to deaths to pillage and to wrong had most become, that the ties of brotherhood and friendship were as ropes of sand or withs of rotten twine-brolken with the breath of a zephyr or an infant's strength. So ever in the brotherhood of crime hath it been, so may it be forevermore; else justice, ever helpless, would fail without their own, self-punishing aid. CHAPTER LXVII.  Two weeks more had passed. A single ship, and' she well known, appeared off the harbor of Kingstown. Flags of triumph flew from her mast-heads, her cannon boomed forth a royal salute, but though many people gathered in silence dn the piers, there were no answering guns from the battery-rhere was no pealing of bells - no sounds of joy from those who gazed on the advancing ship. ' 'Tie strange!" murmured -Sir Henry, as he stood on the deck of his ship and gazed into the harbor, where as yet none other of his fleet had arrived. "Sir Simon was not wont to be so amiss!" He said no more, but ran his vessel to her usual anchorage, where scarcely had his an- chor touched the ground, when a boat came   alongside, containing Sir Simon in person, looking so pale and wobegone, that Sir Henry knew some dire mishap must have occurred to him. "What is the matter, good governor?" asked Sir Henry. "For *hom art thou and all the town m mourning? Is the king dead?" "Were it not treason so to say, I wish he wa!" muttered the governor, half-breathless from his efforts in cambering over the side. Call me not governor any more. I am de- posed, and thou art ordered home to account for thy acts in the Southern eeas!" '4For that I am Well prepnred-I have not onlj wealth enough for all my desires, t ut the king's conmission for my acts!" said Sir Henry. ' I wish no better news for myself; but that thou hast lost thy office I regret to heart' "Were that al/ I had' lost, I would not griev4!" said Sir Simon, piteously. "But wicked men have accused Me of speculation and wrong-doing in mine office, and the new governor hath seized every stiver of my hoarded gold. Worse than all yet, he bath not left me a bottle of wine to keep me from perishing with thirst I I am half-famish- ed, and shall soon sink into a shadow of my former self!" "Go quickly to my steward, and he will afford thee relief!" said Sir Henry, smiling at the idea of that mountain of flesh ever becm- ing a shadow. "And," added he, "I will ac- company thee, for I have some questions to ask 1" The ex-governor was soon seated with a bottle of wine and food before him, and then the admiral proceeded to his questioning- finding it exceedingly difficult, however, to get answers from a mouth constantly filled. Is my friend Solomon yet in office?" asked Sir Henry. "I believe so; but he mourns for his sweet daughter, Miriam, who hath pined away and died! I thought 'twas for the love of me, and I went to offer my hand, but she repulsed me with scorn I Ah, she was a lovely girl 1" And the governor washed back a sigh with a huge goblet of wine. "Who is this new governor?" continued Sir Henry * One Peter Binkes-only a commoner, who knoweth no more about rank than he doth of 'wine-and that is less than nothing. He came ashore, showed me his instructions, and made no ado, but to bid nme leave the government- house at once. As if I, a knight-baronet, should be commanded by a plebeian I told him -a bit of my- mind,. and the consequence was, that having read his commission to the people, he told me that I might leave in the tirst ship for England, or else wait here, in   prison, to have eharges aginst me investi- gated. I felt disgusted with his vulgarity ; and leaving the government louse, went to board at the Falstaff Inn. But though it bears the name of one who loved good living in his day, they have nigh famished me l" "1 Thou must not take such griefs to heart " skid Sir Henry, kindly. "Thou shalt have passage to England in my ship!" "And may I purvey ,ty provisions for thee9" asked Sir Simon, his ruling passion strong amid all his griefs. "There shall be no stint of them -fear not " replied Sir Henry. - "But L must go to the shote, and see tibs governor, and what in- structione he hath eooperaing me tw "He may rob thee of thy gold. even as he did me, in the name of the kinpg!t "I fear not that. To the king alone, who gave me my commission, will I aocountl" "And shouldet thou make peae with the king, wilt thouinot strive to make peace for me? If that were done, . might get some new office at his hands, and not be forced back to my poor place in Hampshire!" "I cannot pledge myself for another, until I see how I stand myself".said Sir Henry, kindly. "Thou hast done me some favors, and I shall not forget them!"  "Then let me be thy commissary, end lay in provisions for our home-voyage. There are turtles and .rum, brandy and beef, such as it is, and wine, and a few coops of capons, and sugar antl lemons for our punoh-.ah, my good Sir Henry, let me be. thy oommiesary 1" "I fear thou wouldst load my ship unto sinking!" said Sir Henry, with a laugh. Then, turning to a servant, he bade him have his barge manned, that he might go on shore. I hope thy steward will not let me famish in thy absenee; and if thou canst but persuade that Peter Binles to give up my wine,.and my hams, and the fatted capons in my coopa, and -four puncheons of rum in the oellar and some casks of brandy, they will be a great help on our homeward voyage. If he eats or dranks any of them, I only hope they'll choke him, though 'twere not so hard a death after all, as %e deserveth, that of being choked on good food and drink. I should rather-die thus than with a ullet in my heartl" Laying his hand upon the most prominent part of his body, Sir Simon sighed at that thought, add, Sir Henry having go peTi- etly asked the steward to brin it another Iottle of wine, and to repleni the plates be- fore him. This having been done, he esigned himself, with a sigh of satisfaction, the only thing, to him, now worth living fo the filliag up of  I famished body.   - CHAPTER LXIX. Contrary to the idea of Sir Simon that Peter Binkes was a plebeian in manners as well as a commoner! in rank, Sir Henry found him to be a gentleman in manners, evidently educated, and far more courteous in his ways, though less pompous, than the recent goves- nor. On announcing his name and mission, the governor handed 'him a yet-unsealed package from the king's own hand, in which the king made no complaints of the acts of his adm4iral and knight; but said that both Spain and France, and other nations aswell, had so solemnly protested against the terri- ble exeesses of the ao-called English bucca- neers in the Southern Seas, that it was inlpos- sible for the government longer to permit so brave a knight, and an officer so skilled, to act under its commission, without incurring the danger of a general war, Sir Henry was comrannded to return home, where other and yet more honorable employment would await him, if he desired. Morgan's face glowed with pleasure when he read these words, for they indicated to him, that when he had added what he could spare from his last bounty to the king's trea- sury, the latter would scarce refuse him any favor which he should ask. He inquired of the new governor if he had any orders in regard to the time of his sailing homeward, but the latter had none. The king had not chosen to endanger his secrets by communicating with any other than the admiral himself. Sir Henry then asked about the charges against Sir Simon, and the new governor, without hesitation, revealed them., They were grave, and: many of t!em Sir Henry knew to be true. The avarice of Sir Simon, which was only exceeded by his gluttony, had been his ruin. He had not only imposed un- just and cruel taxes upon the people, but hiu returns to the home government proved he had withheld these unjust dues from the king's treasury. Truth to say, hnd be shared his robberies with the king, the chances iero helhad nst been deposed and himself ruined in return. . But it is against all law-gover- mental rule, rather-ancient or modern, for an officer to rob under the name of his gov- ernment, and refuse to share with his superi orN, Governor Binkes, when he heard of the suffering of the old bar,net in regard to the loss of his wine, showed to the admiral vouchers, which showed that he had received these very wines by conniving at frauds upon his majesty's customs. But he approved ful- ly of the admiral' offer to take im from the   island. "For," said he, "he will breed a famine if he remains." This interview over, having permission at onee to victual his ship for her homeward voyage, the admiral bethought him of his friend Solomon; and taking leave of the gov- ernor, hastened to the quarters of the Jew. The black drapery of his reception-room, as well as the pile face and grief-worn look of the good Hebrew, would have told Sir Hen- ry of his great misfortune, had he'not heard of it before.. Hastening forward to take the thin, white hand of the sorrow-stricken father, he en- deavored to console him by the kindest words of sympathy. "Thy daughter was an angel on earth; think the now is one in heaven " said Sir Henry. "She; was my solo stay. on earth-my last prop is torn aw ay! Yet, Sir Henry, I will bold up until I obey the last order of the king. By some means, he learned that I had fled hither, though-as thou knowest-my re- turns as his agent were made in another name. Behold the order he sent hither before my Miriam died." And he took a paper from his bosom, which bore the broad seal of England, Sir Henry's face flushed as .he thought of the beauty and virtue of the noble girl, and read a positive order from King Charles for Solomon to return to his court and bring with him his daughter. For well he knew its im- port. Nor king nor noble in those days had propositions of honor to make to the lovely daughters of that proscribed and persecuted race: they would use the treasures of their fathers, and rob their children ofall that was left to them-their honor. Bitter words were spoken by Sir Henry- words of scorn for a king who wpuld stoop to such cruelty and infamous6 injustice. He handed the document back to the Jew, who spat upon its royal signature, yet returned it o his bosom. ("Wouldst see my daughter?" asked the Jew, after he had calmed himself a little more. "Is she not dead and ' nried?" asked Sir Henry. "Ay, dead-but not bnriedj Come hither and behold her!" replied Solodmon. And he led the way into the room which had bese her boudofr. Unlike that which they had left, its drap" ry was as white as snow, and the room wP filled with the fragrance of flowers. With waxen tapers burning around it, Sir Henry beheld a magnificent chest, its open- ed lid and sides glittering with costly gems. And there, loohing more beautiful to him, it seemed, than e'er she had in" life, lay Miriam the Jewess. Diamonds glittered in her jettyr 8   hair; her scarce pale lips apart, revealed her snowy teeth; the very eyelids, lying down on the white cheek like ailken threads, seem- ed to move. Her hands, holding a flower white as themselves, were meekly folded on her breast. Oh, very lovely difd she look. "Thou hast deceived me She but sleeps," said Sir Henry, in a low whisper, as if, indeed, he feared to wake her. 'Ay, she sleeps; but it is the sleep whish knoweth no waking " said the Jew, mournful. ly. "Thy hand hath been stained with blood. Were she living, she would shudder at its touch," said the Jew, in continuance. "Lay it now on hers; but touch her gently-gen- tly."  The knight did so, esdi-he shuddered; for he felt that her hands *ere indeed cold with the ice of death. I "How is it that in death she looks so natu. ral, and w4ars yet the beauty that was her own in life?" asked Sir Henry. ' It is a secret of our race." replied the Jew. "Such will she bb until the king's or- der is obeyed, and she hlth been seen by him who drove her to her death. By the first ship, I will  her to my ancient home in Loand     rttJhou didst look upon her f in h     #n, when iis eyes hlave Igazed tf  eir, his unholy Land touched herJ pure brow, now icy cold, I will crave permis- sion to bear her to the land of myfathers, that she may sleep among the graves of Is- rael." "The first ship will be mine I And thou, with that sacred urn, and all thy treasure, shalt have safe passage!" cried Sir Henry. "My treasure " and the Jew spoke se mournfully. "My treasure hath all been robbed from me by the hand of death. She lieth there, pale and chill, who was more to me than all the gold and jewels ever coined. or wrought, or found, upon this wintry earth " The grief of the Hebrew was so painful to Sir Henry, as well as the sight before him, that he hastened to terminate the interview. "I will leave thee now," he said, "and soon will I send thee word when thou canst embark. I shall hasten all I can, for I long once more to set my foot on English soil. My hated task is over. My dreams of fame are over. The task, I thought, would be more pleasant. But to add to the treasury of the king, and ac- quire a needed fortune for myself, I have had to earn the name of apirate rather than a hero, Which, in my setting out, I sought for. I will say no more. Farewell, thou good old man, until I am ready once more to breast the blue ocean and its gales!" "He called me a good old man-I who am a Jew, despised, hated even-by those who use me," muttered the old man, after Sir   Henry, with a quivering lip and glistening eye. "My Miriam knew not, else she would not so have grieved over his 'cruel heart.' The heart is not cruel that sheds a tear for the sorrows of a Jew.        it CHAPTER LXX. Weeks had passed. Borne by favoring breezes fcRoss the ocean, God seeming to bless him who grieved for past wrongs/and sought to better them, Sir Henry Morgan, clad in a glittering uniform, stood in the presence of his king. Only Charles and his ministers-of whom one was Yarnaliff-were present in the gorgeous room which the king calls his closet. yet where the most weighty affairs of his kingdom were conducted. "Valiant knight and doughtiest admiral on the seas, thou art welcome back to our realm!" said the king.  "The treasure which thou hast brought back to our treasu- ry hath made us rich indeed. Yet not for tat, much as we needed it, would we engage our subjects in a war with half the world. Deem not that we feel not thy merit, or for wrong thou hast done to those rich and haughty Spaniards that thou art recalled. We hold thee nearer now than when thou wert knighted by our royal hand.'? "Thanks, most gracious sovereign l" said Sir Henry, as he knelt to kiss the royal band. (' Henceforth, wear this, for our sake," aids the king; and he threw the collar, alljeweled as it was, of the noblest order in his realm, taken from his own neck, over the shoulders of the knight. "Rise," he added, " and we pledge thee our kingly word to refuse thee no re- quest which thou shalt make; and we thank the Lord Yarneliff for suggesting such a re- ward." "Morgan rose, and uttering not a word, looked back at Yarnoliff. The latter seemed to understand him; for lie left the room, but returned in an instant, leading a girl of most eesplendent beauty, yet clothed in the habil- iments of deep mourning, by the hand. Taking that hand, Morgan knelt and said, while she knelt in anxious loveliness by his side: "My liege and king, this maiden is my be- trothed bride, of more worth to me than all the jewels I have brought to thy hand. Thou east promised to grant, any request I make." * Ay, and will not break the pledge, brave knight. Speak on, for thou hast a lovely ad- vocate by thy side." "I crave her father's pardon and restora- tion to his title and estates; the first, once held as loyal and as noble as any in this realm." "His name " asked the king. "His name and crime, if title and estates have been at- taint?"   "It is there, great king." And the kneeling knight held out a pa. per, which Lord Yarneliff had handed to him when he led the maiden in. The king's brow darkened as he read its contents. "Sir William Set'on, attaint of treason to our royal father, and of aiding the foes which betrayed him unto death! Sir knight, thou hast asked, indeed, a favor I But the royal word shall not be broken -thy request is granted! But ask no more like it. Where is Sir William Sefton-didat thou find him and his fair child abroad?" "I will answer for him, most noble king," said an old, hump-backed man, entering and kneeling before the king. "I am here mand if thou wilt but grant me proper audLence, with proofs, I will yet show that one who holds an earldom in the realm conspired by false report to ruin me. Too well they suc- eedled. I was no traitor to thy royal father; and I only fled the realm when my poor sword and broken fortunes could no longer aid him." "' Prove thou that, and the false earl's land and titles shall be thine. But rise, each of ye, for I wot there shall be a merry wedding in my palace ere this night is passed! Thou wilt give this knight thy child?" "Yes, my liege-her heart and hand is his, and I have enough to dower her, equal to her wortl,." "It is well. Let the bridal be this night, and sup ye afterward with me." And all the ministers withdrew, as well as did Sir Henry with Coraline and her father. The king, now alone, sat down again, and seemed to muse upon the strange events which just had passed. Buthis musings were very soon interruped by one of the royal  pages, who entered and knelt before him. *"What now, good boy?" said the king, rather with impatience. For having done a good action, it was worth while, indeed, for him to muse over it. Such tliings are rar with kings, who hold by divine right, they say, that "the king can do no wrong." "My liege, there is a Jew in the corridor, who hath had a heavy obst brought hither. ie saith he is from over the sea, and hath brought thee a treasure," said the page.' "Why doth he not ask audience of the lord of my treasury, then?" "fie saith, my liege, that his errand alone is with thee. That thou didst send for him; and he sent thee this document." The king took the proffered paper, It was torn and soiled, as if it had been handled rudely. His face brightened an instant, yet his voice trembled when he said: "Bring the Jew hither. I will question him.   "And his chest, my liego?" "Ay-lie may have brought a ransom in the place of the prize for which we sent, and both may fall into our possession. A Jew may not trifle with a Christian king i"  The page arose and departed, and soon re- turned ushering in the Jew Solomon. Behind them came a body of the king's guard, bear- ing the heavy chest. It was placed on the floor, and the king mo- tioned all but the Jew to depart. "What hast thou in that chest, Jew?" de- manded the king.  "The treasure for which thou didst send, King Charles," replied the Hebrew, whose excited look and glittering eye looked like anything but fear, even of a monarch. "I sent not to thee for any treasure. I learned where thou and thy fair daughter had fled to, and sent for thee and her to return." "Knew why we fled beyond thy power, also?" "I ask questions-'tis not for me to answer them." "I'll ask no more, then, King Charles. I have obeyed thine order." "Where is thy daughter, then-I see her not." "Behold her, king-look upon the dearest treasure of my heart." And the Jew unlock- ed, and dashed open the glittering lid of the chest. "Ha! Art. thou so cunning 9 Hast brought her here asleep? How beautiful she looks!" "She sleeps her last sleep, air king 1" said the Jew, with a quiet sternness of grief which subdued even the anger of a passionate mon- arch. "Place thy hand upon her icy brow- touch thou those cold hands." The king did so, and shuddered. "Cold- cold!" he said, in a 1w tone, "Jew, hast thou murder, d her?" "No, king, I have not. A more powerful hand than mine hath placed her beyond the reach of dishonor. Art thou satisfied? Wilt accept the treasure I have broughltthee?" "No-no, take her away, Jew. Take her away. Not for my crown would I wong her, were she living. Guilt like mine, passion which a king acknowledges to a Jew like thee to be infamous, hath here its punishment. God will not hold me guiltless of that poor child's death." And Charles, for once forgetting that he was a king, knelt and wept over that beautiful corpse-wept as a man, not as a monarch. And the Jew, touched by the scene, wept, too. And while they wept, a sigh came up from that chest so deep, that the king started to his feet. "It is a miracle," he murmured. "Though oold in death, some angel sigha through her   lips, or her disembodied spirit hath come back to sigh that I am forgiven. Jew, call my guard and have-her borne hence-this is too much for me." And the monarch sunk back half insensible on his seat. Quickly did the Hebrew father close and lock the chest, and then he raised a crr of alarm, which speedily brought help to'the fainting monarch. The officers who waited nearest came, and among yet others came Sir Henry Morgan. "Have my treasure borne to thy quarters, my noble friend. The king would not accept my treasure," said the Jew to the knight. "Perchance, when there, I may show thee a miracle, and how a Jewish father may-ay, hath saved the honor of his child." The knight scarce understood ibic import of the words spoken by Solomon, for they were , ttered in a whisper; but he quickly called aid, and the chest was removed, apparently to the comfort of the king, for when he unclosed his eyes and saw it not before him, he merely told his officers that a sudden faintness over- cmac him, nor deigned any further exflana. tion, but rose and retired to his ohamb CHAPTER LXXI. It was scarce a half-hour later. In a room,. closed to all other visitors, stood our friend Ethelbert, otherwise and now fully known as Sir William Sefton. Near him, dressed in her snowy bridal robes, was Coraline, leaning on the arm of him who was so soon to call h by the sacred name of wife. Yet Iwo others were there-Lord Yarncliff and the Hebrew father of lost Miriam, Lost, say we? Let us see if a miracle may not again bring her to existence. For before the open chest, around which they all circle, stands that Jewish father,^ holding in his hand a bottle, which, when un- corked, diffuses a strong aromatic odor through the room. He anoints her pale brow, her cheeks, her hands. "She lives and breathes," murmured Sir Henry. "Her dark eyes unclose," whispers his be- trothed. "Is this magic or sorcery?" asked Lord Yarncliff. "It is neither," said the Jew. "My daugh- ter's life was mine until I knew her honor wapr safe. The secret of the drugs I used to pro- duce the icy semblance of death, tooi, is mine, and will be to my death; for I swore, yeare- sinee, by the faith of my fathers, to keep it. The king will never trouble my child more. Awake, arise, my Miriam-thy father calls, and thou art safe." Aided by Sir Henry. the lovely girl was /   lifted from the jewel-spangled bed, and quick- ly clasped to the bosom of Coraline-who, of all present, knew best how to sympathize with her. The scene is painted-we draw a curtain on a picture of joy.' And we will raise it on another. Yet an- other hour had passed. The king, who had become quite indisposed, had sent his orders that the marriage of Sir Henry Morgan should 4i   not be impeded by his illness. And now, a- companied by a bride-maid, who looked al. most unearthly in her beauty-it was none other than Miriam-Coraline Sefton walked to the holy altar in the king'sowa chapel, fol. lowed by a noble train, there to givq and hear the vows which made her Lady Morsan. And the words were spoken- The holy words were said, Which could ne'er be broken Until one or b6th were dead.   CETTHEBEST!   CETT"HE BEST!

This book is an admirable specimen of French ro- antic literature, and i the ablest work of FOR- DU BOISGOBEY, a celebrated Parisian liter- ateur. It has been translated into pure English, with aotering force and rare elegance, by Colonel THOMAS PICTON. Cane-Cou has a strangely involved yet perfectly   probable plot, and the characters are such as may be met with at any time in either the salons or cellars of the wonderful City of the Seine. The au- thor, though he describes the vicious as well as the good, never velitates with gilded criminality, but wages a war to the death with every species of iniquity.   THE CHEVALIER CASSE-COU is elegantlyprinted, from handsome, legi. blc type, and makes two books (THE RED CAMELIA and THE SEARCH FOR ANCESTORS), each of nearly 400oages. Price, $1.00 each. Ida Goldwin; or, The Perils of Fortune. A Power- ful Original Romance. By "* ALEaO DrnKBY." This book is a transcript of real events, real emotions, and such real complications as are bound up in the story of human life "from year to year." Though the brilliant author never in a single line overpaints tho truth, he has found and successfully describes scenes of mental and physical suffering-characters that show all the demon and all the angel traits to be found in human hearts. While the admirers of sentiment and pathos will find passages to cause that " unquiet drooping of the lids, as if the eyes were filled with unshed tears," the lovers of genuine humor will have plentiful food for bursts of hearty laughter.

All orders attended!o with the utmost promptitude, carefulness and accuracy, and forwarded to their destination in the most compact, reliable and expeditious manner. A WORD TO OUR CUSTOMERS ABOUT BOO!KS SENT BY MAIL.   WB have done a large Book trade through the mails for more than twenty years last past, and from this long experience we think we can do that kind of business better than anybody else. Our customers generally find this out to be true when they try other houses, for they always come back, which is a good sign. The secret of this success is very simple. We do not attempt too much, or too many kinds of business. What we do we superintend person- ally, rememberir Franklin's old maxim: "If you would have a thing well done, see to it yourself-if but i1differently done, see to It by deputy." There is not a book-house in New York of any note, except ours, where the proprietors themselves superintend the orders sent off by mail. We find this personal silpervision necessary to prevent carelessness in direcing books, and see that orers arre not misunderstood, nislaild orlost. It requires years of expe- rience in directing books and newspapers to enable a man to be so expert in the business that he will make no mistakes, and this experience we cfalm to possess. It looks like a simple and easy task to put up a package of books, write on it the pur(haser's name nnld acd- dresscorrectly, and put it in the post-office. So it would be, if every person who s -nds tor books would write plain, and give their address properly. But here lies the difficulty. A   good many people do not write plainly; others neglect to give their full address; and some forcCet even to sign their names to their orders. In nearly all the book houses of New York suc h lett rs are thrown aside an I no noticj taken of them at all. We never do that. When we get an order that is obscure or uncertain, we write to the per-on sending it for an explan- ation; and ;wh re the writer h -s ncglticteul to .sign his natme, we notify the postmaster, who generally m in ties to find him out. We never seui a book with ail uncertain direction on it, and in this way we manage to be very successful in having our books go safely Many of our custom rs know this,-and apply here for books w tich they see advertised by other houses, because they feel contilent that we know how to send them in a proper manner. We are proud of tilis reputation, though we seldom say much about it. Sometimes, how- ever, we get money from our customers, and with all our care and attention we cannot find out who sent it. It frequently happens that an old customer will fail to give his proper ad- dress, because he supposes he has done enough business with us to have us remember his address; but we must remindl our fi lends that when they send to this office, it is necessary that they should write their address in full on every letter.   WE receive front 300 to 500 Letters a day, and it is impossible for us to remember the Post Office, County, and State where any particular person receives books. No matter how often you write, put on a plain direction xhere we are to send the answer. Name Post Office, County and Sttate, and tlhei there can be no mistake. Your order will be attended to, and sent by mail or express, the same day it is received by inclosing cash, and directing to R. M. DE WITT, Publisher, 33 Rose Street, N. Y.
