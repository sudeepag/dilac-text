MY TITLE.
" Our Mess! I am the last one left of it-I
mean the mess of the ' Mosquito Fleet,' when
we went to fight the Cuban pirates under
Porter, ni 1b.ro, though I was there before
with poor Allen, of the Alligator, who was
killed by the black-hearted wretches."
Thus'said one of the most distinguished
and gallant officers of our navy to me, a few
days ago ; and then he related some wild and
thrilling incidents, which are the ground-work
of this story. I'In compliment to him, and in
memory of his brave departed mess-mates,
this story takes its title.
CHAPTER I.
It was evening ; and in the palace gf the
Intendente-General of the department of Ma.
tanzas-which overlooked the loveliest bay on
all- the coast of Cu-ba-beauty and valor, as
well as masked villainy, were gathered to the
enjoyment of a festival; for it was the eve of
the birthday of the Senorita Maraquita de
Regla, the lovely daughter of the Intendente-
General, the Marquis Garcia de Regla.
Gay uniforms glittered amid the lace and
gauze and gossamer drapery of the lovely Cu-
ban ladies. There were Spanish, English,
French, and American officers present. The
latter, though evidently regarded with great
favor by the fairer sex, seemed to be looked
upon coldly by the Spanish officers ; and it
was evidently a forced or constrained courtesy
which the marquis himself tendered to them ;
for though he had politely saluted the four
American officers, who caiie in at an early
hour of the evening, and whom lie had evi-
dently met bef re-for he addressed each by
name--- he ht     in that moment avoided
them, and p           particular attention to
other guests.
With one of these-a dark and swarthy
Spaniard, in plain citizen's dress-ho seemed

to be most intimate ; and as this person is -
one with whom we have yet much to do--
character whose history yet lives on record, as
well as upon the lips of tradition--he merits a
special introduction as well as description.
Don EnoIAnDo QuiEsrat, as he was known
at the palace, had suddenly appeared there
about a year before the festival-night which
opens this story. No one but the governor
knew who he was or where he cane from.
The governor was alone-or, at least, his
secretary and daughter only were with hm-
when, unannounced, this person had walked
into his private office, and both the daughter
and secretary were astonished at the unusual
agitation which the marquis exhibited at first,
and the marked respect, even deference, which
he showed afterward to the person whom he
introduced to them, not as a noble, but as a
plain senor.
But the secretary valued his place too much
ever to make allusion to it afterward., The
daughter loved her father too well to wish to
pry into his secrets ; for she, like most chil-
dren, believed that her parent could not do
wrong, and would not introduce to her an evil
man. Yet then, and ever after, when Don
Eduardo Quiestra looked at her with his black
eye-at times as cold as ebony, and then as
fierce as lightning lurking in the midnight-
cloud-she trembled within her heart, and
felt an unspoken terror.
Dressed plainly, but riehily-a costly din-
mond on his finger, and another in his shirt-
bosom-standing over six feet high, with a
forni at once elegant and muscular-a bearded
face, the features of which were expressive of
stern courage, but not of ferocity-and a lofty
forehead, marked, but not disfigured, by a di-
agonal scar as from a sabre-cut across it-this
individual was well calculated to attract ob-
servation, even among so many ; for he was
unlike them  all.  In  his manners, rather
haughty and distant, he avoided such contacts

as he disliked-though, when he chose, he de-
scended from his pedestal of reserve, and in
his conversation, especially with the ladies,
made himself very agreeable.
There was an air of "mystery" about him
which made him attractive in their eyes. his
lavish expenditure of money in oceasiona
presents to some of them, and his charity to
the poor, proved him to be as unselfish as he
was wealthy. But though lie sometimes care-
lessly alluded to his country-residence, he told
no one where it was, and if  sked, evaded the
question. When in Matanz, s, a suite of rooms
in the palace was assigned h mn ; when he went
away, it was in such a man  r, and so secretly,
that no one knew where he went. Only one
servant attended upon his person-a young
man of singular beauty and dignity for one in
a menial position, whom he called Mariano,
and whom lie treated with an almost com-
panion-like kindness.
Having thus introduced mihi, we will leave
him ; and after having, for a moment, glanced
at the loveliest gem of the evening-Maraquita
de Regla-we will close this chapter, and hurry
forward on our,path of romance.
Just eighteen-which is womanhood's full
age of development in that ripe and delicious
clime -Maraquita possessed the oriental fea-
tures of her Moorish descent, with the fairer
and richer complexion of her native Castile.
11er figure could not have been impi-oved ; it
was faultless : for, although not so tall as some
of the beauties tliere, it lacked in no proportion.
l1cr expression was intellectual-soulful. She
looked like one formed alone to love and
to be loved. Of such a one as her the poet
wrote :
-"Such around her shone
The nameless charms unmarked by her alone ;
The light of love, the purity of grace-
The mind-the music bi scathing from her face-
The heart, whose softness harmonized the whole ;
Anti oh ! that eye was in itself a soul !"
She was very beautiful ; and so thought the
young American lieutenant, who, having se-
cured her not unwilling hand for the first con-
tra-dance, was now promnenadling the handsome
saloon with her hand upon his arnm.  nd lie,
with his erect, manly figure, cle blue eye,
rosy complexion, and curling b own locks,
seemed well mated to so beautiful a creature ;
for every step, every motion, every expression,
proclaimed him to be what lie was-one of
Nature's noblemen.
And who but the God-made are noble
Talk of blood and lineage in beasts ; but in
mena, balh ! Where among the demagogues of
the present day are the blood descendants of the
incn of "'7G :"  Where, even upon European
or Asiastic thrones, are the blood-descendants
of lImchard Cour de Lion, Charles of Sweden
Alexander of Russia, Tiniour the Tartar, or
Frederick the Gient?  Or, rather, what are

unknown man of obscure parentage, like the
Napoleon of Corsica, will arise, and, willed by
the strong spirit within him, dash upward

heritage.            -
CIIAPTER II.
"'Who is tlha' young officer who, walking
with your daughter, seems to chain her ear
down to the accents of his tongue ?"' asked the
Seinor Quiestra of the marquis, hvlile the lat-
ter, with a cloud upon his brow, and half-con-
cealed anger in his eye, glanced toward the
couple whose description   closed our first
chapter.
"IIis name is Allen ; lie comnands the Amer-
ican war-schooner in the harbor. I wish he
were gone, for this is not the first time he has
paid marked attentions to my child," ref lied
the marquis, in a low tone.
" Ihis is one of the vessels sent out by the
Yankee government to prevent the collection
of tribute to the black flag, is she not ?" asked
Quiestra, while his passionless face lighted up
for an instant with a sneering expression.
" She is," replied the marquis.
"Introduce me to him, and then draw your
daughter away without arousing a suspicion
in him that it is intentional," said Quiestra.
Tle marquis bowed in acquiescence, and,
accompanied by the former, moved across the
room in a direction to intercept his daughter
and her escort. ie did so, but only at the
upper end of the room, as they were about to
step out uo)0n a piazza which overlooked the
harbor, whither Allen had invited his fair
companion to look upon his vessel, as she lay
upon the moonlit waters of the bay like a bird
asleep, but ready in a moment to lift her
wings for flight.
Permit me to introduce my particular
friend, Don Eduardo Quie-stra, to the notice
of Lieutenant Allen," said the haughty mar-
quis to the young American.
"I am very happy to become acquainted
with any friend of the Marquis de Regla l"
said Allen, frankly extending his hand to the
Spaniard.
,    To the surprise of Maraquifa, who had no-
ticed his habitual reserve, especially toward
, all the foreign officers, Quiestra not only took
f the proffered hand, but shook it warmly ; but
she had not time to observe more, for her father,
saying: "There is the Countess de Villalieneva,
my child, whom we have not wtloiied," placed
f her arm within his, and hurried heraway-lcav-
e ing Quiestra and Alleumi   a position where
they would necessarily be obliged to improve
s their recent introduction.
, i" The marquis is rather unceremonious
r depriving me of. my late partnr in the (ane
e said Allen, rather disappointed in the loss
a wished-for walk and talk upon the piazza.

heart is endangered when in contact with a
fair-haired son of the North. She is his only
one, and we cannot blame him that lie guards
her closely," said the Spaniard, speaking in a
careless tone, and ev'incing no interest in the
matter by any expression of his face.
"I never would wrong her noble heart,"
said Allen, quickly. "lIle need never guard
her from me, for 1 would lose a life in her de-
fence, or for hqr honor !"
"A h ! you love her,,then ?"
Quiestra said this in such a cold, utterly
passionless, and disinterested tone, that Allen,
naturally ingenuous and confiding, thought
not of duplicity or a danger of betrayal, and
he said :
"Yes, with all my heart !"
"And is your love returned ?"
The Spaniard asked this question in such a
way that Allen began to be upon his guard.
IIe replied
"I have already said too much upon this
subject to z stranger-more than I should
done."
You have said so much," replied Quiestra,
in a quiet way, "that to reply to my question
will not add to your error, if you have erred.
A confidence should never be halved."
"In this case it must be," said Allen, ab-
ruptly.,
For a second-not a second, a breath's time
only-fire flashed in the Spaniard's black eye,
but the next instant it was as calm and cold
as before.
"As you will," he said, lsindly. . "I have
no right, as a stranger, to intrude myself upon
your confidence : nor, perhaps, should I offer
a friendship which might be usefulin promot-
ing your future happiness ; for I, 'elieve that
few men have more influence with the Marquis
de Regla than myself."
"Forgive me; I am over-cautious perhaps.
But this is a delicate matter ; only-the lady
and yourself are aware of my attachment,"
said Allen, again grasping the hand of the
Spaiiard. " I will not withhold my full' con-
fidehee from you. The lady does return my
affection ; but'she fears her father's anger, and
will not permit ine to make known to him my
feelings and wishes, as I desire."
"She is right, and possesses more sense and
prudence than most of her sex. 11er father is
a strange man, and must be approached with
caution and in accordance to his natures But
let us walk upon the piazza; there ire too
many Estening ears around us here."
Arm in arm, as if they had been t vo old
friends, these utter opposites in looks and na-
ture passed from the saloon to the piazza, to
the wonder of more than one whq knew Qui-
estra, and had never before seen(hiin touch
the arm or hand of a male acquaintance, or
descend from the icy throne of his reserve.

ERS OF TIE GULF.                         d
CHAPTER III.
"Botheration to ye, should on ! Should on,
I say, and I'll have the ivory adrift before ye
can toss off a glass o' grog!"
Reader, permit me to introduce to your no-
tice, Surgeon Florence O'Shaughnessy, of the
U. S. schooner Alligator, a gentleman with all
the " rich brogue of Erin" rolling off his
tongue, yet claiming, and rightfully, to-be an
American-born citizen, for he was born under
the American flag, while his father was Amer-
ican Consul at Dublin.
The doctor's height was not less than six
feet, yet unless he stood by the side of another
person, you would think him very short, he
was so fat. His body was built much like a
rum-puncheon, and its capacity for acting as
one, was very frequently tested by the doctor.
His head was very small, and his legs were not
of a size to correspond with his trunk, in fact
they looked too frail to support such a weight
above. In truth, put a small pumpkin on top of
a cask, putty on a pug nose, cut a wide mouth,
and stick a few bristles on the top for hair,
punching two small holes for eyes, and then
put two broomsticks beneathfor'legs, and you
will have a very tolerable representation of
Doctor O'Shaughnessy.
His particular occupation at the moment
when we introduce him to the reader was that
of extracting a tooth from the mouth of the
negro cook of the schooner. He had got his
turn-key upon the grinder, and his assistant,
the medical steward of the vessel, was holding
back the negrd's head by the wool, while the
doctor, with both hands griping the handle of
the instrument and his feet firmly set against
the carriage of the gun on which lhe had seat-
ed the " subject of operation,'' was pulling
with a vigor which made it certaiiI that some-
thing must come up by the roots-either wool
or ivory. The negro, with both hands set
against the doctor's protuberant abdomen, was
involuntarily assisting in the operation, while
his eyes rolled in agony, and his face assumed
a bluish hue, with the pain of the toothache,
and this additional infliction.
As the doctor gave an additional jerk when
he cried out shouldd on," the obstinate tooth
gave way, and the doctor's body went with it;
and his next position was horizontal, so far as
his body was concerned. But his legs flour-
ished in the air, and his long right arm was
raised with the instrument and the to th in
token of triumph ; while the freed neg' , u'u-
ing a yell of mingled delight and pain, rushed
away toward the galley, fully determined never
to have the toothache again on board of that
vessel.
Assisted by the steward, the doctor regained
his feet in a moment, and as he regarded the
tooth, or rather tusk, which he held, he said
"Be jabers, 'tis no wonderit pulled so hard !
It has roots like an ould oak. The next one I

have to pull for the nager I'll have the capstan
mannedl I've exhausted myself entirely, P1l1
have to take some of my own medicine !"
By way of explanation, we must state that
the doctor s principal rule of practice was con-
fined to what he called the three great " Bs"
.Bleceling, l)listeri n g, and brandy.
In this case, bi-andy was the medicine which
Le considered necessary, and he took a dose as
soon as possible.
CIIAPTER IV.
When Lieutenant Allen and the Spaniard
3tepped1 out upon the piazza, a lovely scene
greeted their eyes. Directly beneath their
feet was the beautiful garden of the palace,
teeming with flowers and fruits, all glittering
in the golden moonlight, or mellowing off iito
the shadows of the trees-but beyond lay the
ay, rippling like dancing silver in the wind
and moonlight. Several large vessels of war
lay in the anchorageusually allotted to vessels
of that class, and nearer in toward the town
were a few merchantmen of different rigs. But
by far the prettiest of all, was the taut and
rakish little schooner of which Allen was the'
commander. IIer black hull was long, sharp
fore and aft, yet of great breadth of beam at
and just abaft the fore-rigging ; it lay low in the
water, and up above it rose spars calculated to
spread an immensity of canvas. Though she
was a half mile off, the moon glittering upon
her brass eighteen-pounder amidships, and her
six carronades of a side, enabled the Spaniard
at a glance to note her armament.
I need not ask which is your vessel !"
said Quiestra to Allen.   " None but your
countrymen can build or rig a vessel like
that !" and he pointed to the schooner.
Allen was gratified with the compliment, for
he not only felt a sailor's pride in the vessel
which he commanded, but also an honest and
 patriotic emulation in the country which he
served.'
SIs your schooner very fast?" asked the
Spaniard.
"She has never been beaten, except by one
vessel, the Pilot, of New York, built by the
same man, a vessel of the same size and rig.
She can beat us slightly off the wind, we are
her match when close hauled !"
"Indeed! Is that vessel in your Government
service, also ?"
"No, sir-she was purchased for the Mexi-
can p;rin ateer service, just before we sailed, and
i probably on her way to Vera Cruz, by this
time, under American colors, there to assume
Mexican. As her captain intendyl to stop
either at Key West or Havana, on his way
out, we directed him to bring out our letters !"
I should like to see her! I have a passion
for beautiful vessels. You wuld hardly think
so by my dress and nppearance ; but I am a
savor myself or was in my younger days'"

ESS; U.R,l
"I had a suspicion that yen hac tasted salt
water-perhaps you have seen service !" and
Allen glanced at the scar upon the Spaiard's
brow..
"Sonic in my younger. days !" and a grim
smile lighted up the face of tha speaker. " If
I am informed rightly of your object in these
waters, you are likely to see active service !"
said he, in continuation.
I hope so !" said Allen, enthusiastically
"I would give three years' pay to lay yard-
arm and yard-arm with, or to stand upon the
same deek with COLCEFRINAS, the Terror of the
Gulf !"
A dark flush ran over the face of the Span-
iard, and his great eyes again flashed for an
instant like those of a fierce animal about to
spring into battle ; but Allen was'looking at his
vessel, and did not observe the agitation which
the Spaniard exhibited, though it lasted only
an instant. When it passed away, he said:
"Your ambition is but natural, yet were you
to meet this redoubtable chief, you might find
yourself overmatched. I have heard much of
him of late years. But why do you single him
out of so many piratical leaders? There is
Domingo, almost as famous as he; Velasqusa e
and others !'
" Ibeeause he is the acknowledged leader of
them all-the bravest-the most ferocious ! '
"Ferocity and bravery do not go togeth ,r,
young man !" said the Spaniard. "This Ccl-
cefrinas, if the report of his enemies be true,
possesses courage without cruelty, and even
though lie claims a right to exact tribute from
all who cross his path, he never sheds blood, I
have heard, except in cases of resistance !"
"That may be so ; yet, nevertheless, he is a
pirate-his hand is raised against every flug,
and we are bound to destroy him !"
"If you can catch him !" and again that
shadowy smile came out upon the Spaniard's
face. And his tone was so sarcastic when ho
spoke, that Allen, who had been looking over
the water, turned to catch the expression of his
face. But it was now as calm as when he made
his introductory bow.
"Are you well acquainted with the-coast of
this island ?" asked Allen.
"As well as one can be who from his child-
hood has been reared upon its shores. There
is se~'ce a bay or inlet that I have not visited
at one time or another !" ,
"I wish that I knew so much of the coast.
Our charts are imperfect-only the larger in.
dentations of the coast are down, and the very
spots which pirates would seek for hiding-
places are omitted. We work in the dark !"
"Being after dark men, perhaps it is best !"
and again the Spaniard smiled. "When will
you sail. ?'l he asked in continuation.
" As soon as either of the vessels appointed
to act in concert with me arrive !"
I should like much to take a cruise wit
you in search of that Colcefrinas ! I sho

lute myself to meet him, though I would not
care to cross swords with him !"
"I a k no better fortune than that !" replied
Allen. "But if you are serious in your desire
to take a cruise in the Alligator, as my guest,
you will be very welcome."
"A thousand thanks ! I have some business
which calls me to my estate at an early hour
in the morning, and must go there. But if
you do not sail before I return, count upon
me as'making one at your table on your next
cruise. And now we will return to the saloon.
I will so manage, that you will have an hour's
converse with the fair M araquita, without in-
terruption from either her father or that vine-
gar-faced old aunt of hers !"
"Oh, thank you, my kind friend-thank
you a thousand times! Excuse the unjust
suspicions which made me for a moment hesi-
tate to bestow my full confidence upon you!"
Arm in arm, as they had gone forth, the
two gentlemen now re-entered the saloon.
Maraquita, surrounded by a group of admirers,
but still resting upon her father's arm, was
near, and to her Quiestra at once led the way.
"Marquis, I have a word to say to you in
private ; be so good as to leave your daughter
:n the care of this gallant officer, who will
doubtless keep all pirates at a distance from
sq fair a prize, and retire with me for a few
moments," said the Spaniard, to the father of
Maraquita.
The marquis looked astonished, seeming
hardly to understand the words of Quiestra ;
but at a look from the latter, which command,
ed rather than asked, he dropped the arm of
his daughter, which, with his implied consent-j
was instantly placed in that of Allen, and tak-
ing the arm of-Quiestra, he accompanied that
mysterious person back to the piazza, which
he had so lately occupied with Allen.
"What does this mean, senor-you surely
do not wish to forego your claim on Maraqui-
ta's hand, in favor of this audacious North
American ?" cried the marquis to Quiestra, the
moment that they were alone.
"Not for an instant, my dear marquis," re-
plied the latter, blandy. "But I have got to
heat this Yankee at his game, and must use
himself to do it. You know his errand to this
coast, and what its success will cost both.you
and me. I have already wormed myself into his
confidence, and that which I have just done
will add to .'my power with him. He loves
your daughter and she loves him-the fool
told me so !"
"Mid malediciones! I will shut her up in a
dungeon!"
"You will do no such thing. It is too late
to either starve, or chill, or frighten the love
out of her heart. But I care not for that !
When she is my wife, 'll draw the reins tight-
r; at present, like a decoy, she must be used
 blind him to our work, and to lure him to
point where I shall decide that he stops,

and stops forever ! DI shall plan all this work.
Garcia de Regla, I only ask you to execute and
obey ! Remember the past-had it not been
for, me you would not be what you are now--
only by my aid can you reach the post you
desire, and  become  Governor-General of
Cuba !"
"Do not speak of the past !" said the Mar-
quis ; and he shuddered and closed his eyes, as
if he wished to shut out some terrible vision.
"I will not, if you do a man's duty for the
present. Now listen to me. I leave for the
rendezvous in an hour.' There is a schooner
on her way out from the north which I must
capture, for she can out-sail the fastest one in
their fleet-which this young Yankee com-
mands. Use every means, except open force,
to keep him from going to sea before I return ;
for I intend to come back and go to sea on a
cruise with him, as a friend and pilot. Ho
wants to-see Colcefrinas, and he shalt see him!"
"Madre de Dios ! You will not place yoi ur-
self in his power ?"
"No-I shall not be in his power. I a- a,
with him, only your friend, Don Eduar 1o
Quiestra-not-"
"Breathe not your name here, for Heavei's
sake, capitano mio !" said the Marquis, wi ch
anxiety and haste.
"Don't terrify yourself-I shall not. B it
mark my words, and obey my directions ivii-
plicitly. If you permit this Yankee free a-
cess to visit your daughter while I am gore,
he is so much in love, that he will forget his
duty, and linger longer' ththi lie would do ofh-

. "Do you not trust that youth too far ?"
asked the marquis.
"Have you ever seen a look or heard from
his lips a word that would tend toward my
betrayal ?"
"No, senor."
"Then I do not trust him too far. But now
let 1s return to the saloon; and Iwill go away
as soon as I can do so unobserved !"
CHAPTER V.
A half hour later, while ' the music of
the festival came faintly upon his ear, Quiestra
stood in the chamber which was always as-
signed to him when lie visited the palace.
His dress was not now the plain, peaceful cit-
ien's garb, which he had worn in the salqo
of the Intendente General. He wore a close-
fitting shirt of mail, whie  completely pro.
tected his person, from his neck to his hips.

Over this he drew a loose frbck, or blouse of
embroidered velvet, and buckling a belt
around him, to which a short, curved sabre
was attached, placed in it a brace of gold-
mounted, long-barreled pistols, an  a long,
broad-bladed dagger. Upon his he 'dhe wore
a close-fitting cap, while the nether 1"mubs were
almost concealed by a pair of heavy-looking,
but really light turkey-leather boots, which
eamo considerably above the knee.
Upon a chair close by hung a large sea-
cloak, adapted to concealing the person, as
well as to protect it from what is seldom
known in that country, inclement weather.
Before him stood the valet, or page we
might call him, to whom we have alluded once
or twice before. lie was not tall for one of
his sex; in figure rather slight, but even
more elegantly proportioned than his master.
His features were exquisitely classical ; his
complexion so rich and transparent that the
mantling blood seemed ready to come through
the skin when lie blushed, as he almo inva-
riably did when his master spoke t   him.
His great black eyes were shaded by long,
silken lashes,.and about his temples, over his
white brow, and clear down to his shoulders,
hung masses of curling hair, as black and as
soft as the down on the raven's breast. His
dress was neat and tasty, a tunic buttoning or
rather lacing with loops across his chest and
up to his neck-loose trowsers below, and a
noroceo slipper fitting on a foot small enough
to have belonged to a woman. lie seemed
young, not more than seventeen or eighteen
years old.
"Mariano, my good lad, I an going to pay
a brief visit to our rendezvous, and~perhaps to
take a little fresh pir on blue water. But I
'shall not take you with me this time !"
A look of pain and disappointment express-
ed the feelings of the young'man, but he said
nothing.
"My absence will be very brief," continued
:lhe Spaniard, " and it is my wish, that with-
c-ut appearing to notice anything that goes on
mn the palace, you note everything : particu-
larly nwrk the movements of the lady Mara-
quita and the young American officer, who
ommnands the schooner in the harbor. Should
their folly reach'so far asto look like an inten-
tion of elopement or clandestine marriage, see
that it is prevented."
"Will my master take offence if I ask him
a question ?" asked Mariano, in a low voice
fulf of music.
"No, my good lad-you know that it takes
much to make me angry with you!"
Does the senor, my master, ever intend to
marry the lady Maraquita liimself?"
Not while your mother lives, my boy ! I
would not be unjust to\ hIier, nor break herc
heart. She is rmy queen, and shall be while
the lives ! lh'r,' wiiV do you blush and trem-
m..so?"

"Anxiety for my mother, seilor-nothing
more," replied the young man.
"You need have no fears, then. But take
the heed I bade you. This American is sent,
with many others, to hunt out and destroy
the free rovers of the sea; and we must out-
wit him. lie deems me a friend ; if he ques-
tions you, your ready wit will frame proper
'replies. I have gone to my estate in the
country : you comprehend me ?"
"Yes, my master."
"It is enough, then. Good night. I have
leagues to pass over before the day'dawns."
The young man took the Spaniard's extend-
ed hand, kissed it reverently, and then helped
to put the cloak upon his form. A moment
later, Quiestra had departed, and he was alone.
Then Mariano, with a deep sigh, sat down,
and, hiding his face with his hands, seemed to
lose himself in sad thoughts.
CHAPTER VI.
Along the shores of the Queen of the An-
tilles may be found many a lovely bay ; many
"a pretty little river gushes out through her
flower-covered cliffs into the deep-blue of the
Guff Stream. Yet among all of these there is
no spot so beautiful as that which I am about
to describe.                     -
About twelve or fifteen leagues east of Car-
denas, there is an extended line of small
islands-all of them very lovely-which seem
tg stand as outposts between the gulf and
shore. About midway of this group, urhere
the rocky cliffs of the mainland rise dark and
frowning, a passage has been'pierced by the
hand of Nature through the stern barrier-
which is invisble until one is close upon it-,
and by one unacquainted with it would be
passed unobserved at a cable's length. It. is
narrow-so narrow that'no square-'igged ves-
sel' could enter without having her yards
cock-billed,; and the most careful hand at the
helm would have all that he could do to pick
his way in through the tortuous channel be-
tween the lofty cliffs. But, once in, a bay
large enough to anchor fifty ships-of-the-line
would meet his eye-a bay bordered all around
by a snow-white beach of sand, to the very
edge of which a vessel could be laid. So en-
tirely land-locked is this bay, that not a pulse
of-the ocean-surges from outside could wake a
wave upon its breast. A cresdent-shaped pla-
teau of level land stretches the width of a half
mde back from the bay ; and all around in
the rear of this, lofty and apparently inaccess-
ible hills form the background.
Upon this plateau-much of which is under,
cultivation, ind teems with the various luxu-
riant productions of the tropie --are many
little houses, built of cane, and thatched with
the broad leaves of the palm. In the midst
of these, and facing the narrow entrance to the
bay, is one of larger size and greater are
textural pretensions-for it boasts of a cer'

THE PIRATE-HUNTERS OF TIE GULF.

dah, a, cupola-rotem in which- to enjoy the
balmy evening air-and in its finish is more
perfect than the others. And before it is a
mounted battery of six long eighteen-pounder
cannon, so leveled as to sweep the entrance to
the bay. All over this plateau, and among
the cottages, women and men are walking in
company, and little children are seen at play.
In the bay, lying moored to the shore, are
three armed vessels-two schooners and a
sloop-while a vast number of cast-rowing
boats are drawn up on the beach, with their
oars and boat-hooks stacked near them, ready
for use. Not a flag to denote the nation or
calling of these people could be seen. But
that it was peab3eful, was doubtful ; for nearly
every man wore weapons in his belt, and
seemed prepared to do martial service at a
moment's notice.            '
It is the morning of the second day since
the festival of the birthday of Maraquita de
Regla. We will for a moment look within the
larger house upon the plateau which we have
described. It is magnificently furnished, and
in its draperies, hangings, mirrors, carpets, so-
fas, ottomans, chairs, and tables, it would seem
that the art and industry of all nations had
shared ; for they were as various as they were
rich and costly. From the style of many of
the paintings, and the nature of some of the
gold and silver plate which was almost strew-
ed around (it appeared so profusely), it would
seem that churches had helped to adorn this
most singular and palace-like dwelling.
But of yet another ornament we must now
take note. In an apartment whose large win-
dows, opening from the floor to the ceiling
above, looked out on the bay in front, and on
the northern side toward the mountains in the
northeast, a lady stood, leaning with a listless
air against a marble statue, the form of which
did not see'ni more perfect than her own. It
was of the " Medician" height-five feet six
inches ; yet shc was at least two inches taller,
perfect in every proportion. 1Her age was
fully thirty-five ; yet her face possessed all
the freshness of youth. Her great black eyes
flashed with the fire and passion of sixteen,
and not a thread of silver could be seen amid
the great masses of black, glossy hair which
curled down aboat her white neck and ehoul-
ders. 11er expression was one of majestic dig-
nity. She seemed as if she had been used to
exact and command reverence and respect
from all who approached her. Yet there was
a voluptu''s and dreamy look that told that
love could find--probably had found-a home
a        in the depths of.her nature.
-           The sound of a bugle from the mountain-top
to the north-east reached her ear, and pro-
duced an instant change in her appearance.
IIer eyes flashed, and her countenance lighted
up with a look of joy.
It is Eluardo !" she murmured ; and tak-
ing a gold-monuntod telescope from a table

close at hand, she raised it in the direction
from whence the sound came ; and a look of
disappointment flitted over he' face as she
looked, and she said : "lie comes alone ; my
chlil { is not there ! What can it mean ! O
IIea yen ! should he suspect the truth, and-"
She did not finish her remark ; for a man,
armed and dressed with some insignia which
betokened him to be an officer, entered.
"The captain is coming, senora," said he.
"Yes, Pablo ; I heard his bugle. Raise his
colors on the flagstaff."
The man bowed and retired. A few mo.
ments later, a black flag, with two crimson
swords crossed in its centre, and the name so
dreaded in all the southern waters--" CoLcE-
raINAs"-embroidered in letters of gold be-
neath them, was hoisted from a staff near the
battery in front of the house ; and,- as soon as
this was done, a similar flag floated from each
of the vessels in the harbor, and the men from
every direction hastened to the plateauin front
of the flagstaff, and there formed in military
order to receive their chief, who could noW
be plainly seen descending the mountain-side
with rapid footsteps.
They were a wild, rough-looking gang, arm.
ed each to suit his taste, and, dressed in such
garbs as suited their will and convenience.
They were, judging from their looks, desper-
ate and hardened -men, culled out from al-
most every nation. There was the swarthy
Spaniard, the sallow Frenchman, the yellow
Portuguese, the florid Anglo-Saxon, and the
olive-hued Creole.
4s the-chief, who was none other than hirrm
whom we have known as Quiestrh, approached,
the murmur of many voices which had fi i
the air, ceased, and all was silent when 'he
stepped in front of- the line, and replied to the
salute given by Pablo de Canova, his second
in command.
"Send the crews on board the vessels in-
stantly, Pablo, and be ready to start on a
cruise in an hour! I go with you myself."
These were the only words uttered by Colce-
frinas. These spoken, he turned away as ha ugh-
tily as he had come, and entered the house.
The instant that he had crossed the thresh.
old, a pair of round, white arms were thrown
about his neck, red, ripe lips 'were pressed
burningly to hIs own, and the fair woman,
whom we have so lately briefly described,
murmured:
"Eduardo! Amer mio ! I am      se happy
that you have come again
"I am glad to see you, my Menona ' he an-
swered, far more coldly than her caresses
seemed to merit. "ButI have little tme new
for acts or words of endearment. I have hur-
ried hither for a purpose which I must speed-
ily accomplish. I must put to sea to try and
capture a vessel which I need. The coast will
soon swarm with a host of enemies, who seek
to destroy the whole confederacy of the Free

you out-lavish princes in your expenditures !
Why not lower your fag forever, and do as
you have often in past times told me you
would, go to sonic land where the name of
Colcefrinas is unknown-where you have never
been seen; and there, with a new name, and
rank, which your gold can buy, and my love,
which only death can chill, be happy !"
"What, Monona?    Do my ears hear you ad-
vise me to bend the knee to the dogs of a na-
tion which has not yet counted a half century
of existence-me, ayson of old Castile !"
I did not advise you as a Castillian, bi.t as
one whom I lovcd-whose peril is my ao ny,
whose peace is my bliss!"
" You mean we, 1, Monona, but my course is
laid, and I shall follow it. These insolent Yan-
kees need a lesson, and they shall has e it. The
next thing they will do, after they crush out
the Free Roveirs, if they should do it, will be to
stop our planter, from getting negroes to till
the soil with. That dune, they'll ask for the
Island itself; and if Spain yields not to the beg-
gal's, they'll take it ! They need a lesson, and
Colcefriiias shall he their teacher !''
The woman sail no more, but a mournful
expression looked from her great, black eyes.
Where is Mariano ?" she asked, after a
brief pause.
"I left him behind, at Matanzas, to watch
the movements of some American officers
there, who are awaiting more vessels before
they coie in search of nc."
" Will he not be in danger ? You promised
me, when I first consented that lie should act
as your page and servant, never to let him
leave your side."
lie is as safe, yes,  ore free from peril be-
r.eath the roof of Garcia de Regla, than he
would be here : for here, if the Americans
(sectver my place of rendezvous, blood will
run like water. To give them their due, we

than men. for they won their liberty against
terrible disadvantages ! But all their navy
cannot eonle ir me here, if there is no treach-
ery beieatli my o.wn -flag !"
The woman said no more, although her
looks told that she was far from being happy
nmw. Colcefrimas noticed this, and in a kinder
tone. said .
" Cheer ~p. Menona mic-cheer up ! Bring
mne some wine. I am tired. and will ledge love

"My lord, my life, your 'health and our um
dying love !" she said, and she raised She cup
to her lips and drank, while the blood' in her
cheek, as if emulous of the color of the wine,
flushed deeper and brighter. For it had been
rare of late that his arm had pressed her form,
and now its touch gave new life into her heart.
hIe took the cup from her and drained it to
the bottom ; then tossing it carelessly aside,
drew her down upon her knee, and kissed her
white brow. With a low cry of gladness, such
as a yoi~ng child utters when the mother
comes, for which it has been weeping, she
threw her arms about his neck, and while the
tears of gladness trickled down the rosy path-
way of her cheeks, she gave him a hundred
kisses on his lips, and e5es, and broad, high
forehead. This joy lasted but for a few mo-
ments; for as he glanced toward his vessels in
the bay, lie saw that their sails were loosed,
and he sprang to his feet.
"When will my Eduardo come back ?"
asked the lady.       '
" When lie has succeeded in his enterprise !"
replied the pirate, quietly. " Meantime, let
my brave Monona prove herself competent to
guard her home and my treasures. 1h11e look-
outs on, the mountains must be vigilantly
maintained-those on the islands be on the
watch night and day, Should our foes, by any
fatal error on our part, or any good fortune
of their own, discover the entrance to the bay,
the battery nust tell their doom. Should
they enter, let the hidden mines be fired, while
,you seek safety in the cave known only to
you, myself, and Mariano. I know my Mono-
na will do all this !"
" With God's help I will !" she responded ;
and she crossed herself, as if the actions con-
templated were such as God would bless.
Again lie pressed a kiss upon her brow, and
turning upon his heel, departed.
She watched him until lie reached the beach,
where he launched a light shell of a boat of
peculiar construction. sharp at both ends and
decked ever (like the canoe of an Eequimaux)
except where the rower must sit. Into this
lie sprang, and soon placed himself alongside
of the largest of the schooners.
Springing on board, he left the little boat
to drift in toward the shore or be picked up
l'y some of the men there, and at once gave
such orders, that in a few moments all three
of the vessels were under sail and slowly work
ing out of the harbor.
CIIATER VI.
"What a singular influence this Seior Quies-
tr. seems to possess ever your father !" said
Allen to Maraeuita de Retla, as -soon as they
had moved to a place where they could con,
; erse without being overheard. on the night of
her festival, when the Spaniard. known as
Quieetra, had withdrawn the marquis from
them.

THE PIRATE-HUNT

"it is more singular that he should exert
this influence to favor you !" said the young
lady. 't Although lie has not yet himself di-
rectly pruoposed'lmarriage to mie-for lie knows
that I hate him-he not only has made such a
proposition to my father, but I fear has either
gained the consent of the latter to the step by
his will, or by this same mysterious influence,
forced it from him. More than once has my
father hinted that I am to become his wife !"
And will you ?" asked the young Ameri-
can, in a low, sad tone, as lie fixed his eyes
upon hers.
" Will I ?" she responded-and the hot
blood rushed in a flood up through her veined
cheeks, until, her very brow was all aglo,w-
"wll I?  Not from your lips-not from your
heart s'iould come that question! No, no ! a
thousand times No ! Sooner, far sooner, would
be the bride of Death ! IIe is-I am sure lie
is a-"
She paused, trembled, and turned as pale as
death ; for close before her, looking at her
with flashing, threatening eyes, stood young
Mariano. She (lid not finish the sentence she
had commenced, but turned away ; for the eyes
of the strange youth seemed to cast a spell
upon her tongue, and to chain he' will to si-
lence:         -
Allen had not noticed the youth, for he
came and passed like a shadow;~and he asked:
"What were you about to say, dear Mara-
quita ? What is this strange man ?"
" My filther's friend, and, as you say, a
strange man !" said the lovely girl ; and she
still trembled, for she scemcd to'feel that she
had been on the verge of endangering her
father, by the exposure of some secret.
Let us go and join in the dance again !"
she said, seeming to wish to be placed in a
position where (questions of delicacy could
neither be asked nor answered.
They were soon unon the floor, gliding away
in the soft and dreainy waltz, played as Spani
ish musicians know how to play it.
The Spanih are the only people in the
world who make a luxury ot waltzing. The
I)uteh-exeuse me, the Germans--make of it
a pers pirative labor ; tlie French go through
on railro-ad time ; the Americans go the race-
horse gait, and the Enghlih the rough-road,
stage-coach style.  But the Spanish glide
along like rosyclouds in a breeze-fanned sky,
or like dim shadows over softly rippling wa-
ters. But here I am again, out of the waltz
of my story.
Nose onler had the m lrquis received his final
instructions from Quiestra, and seen the latter
depart fer roni, than he took occasion to
rejoin- his daughter and the young American
officer. To t lie utter astonishment of both, as
well as pleasure of one of them, he seemed
in the most allable hiunor, and remarked that
he was very hapy1. to see them enjoying the
pleasures of the evening so much."

ERS OF TILE GULF.                        13
"I hope, lieutenant," said he to Allen,
"that -our stay will be long in our port, and
that, while here, your visits will be frequent,
and without restr'aint
I shall be only too happy to make my vis-
its frequent !" replied Allen; and rest assured
that no call but that of duty will hurry me
away from the hospitality of your pert !"
The marquis bowed, and passed on, leaving
the heart of Allen bounding high upon the
crested waves of hope. But Maraquita was
sad. She knew that this sudden change of
manner in her father masked some new design,
at the bottom of which lay her antipathy-
Quiestra. And her greatest misery was, that
she could not fathom the design-knew not
how to meet what she felt in her heart was a
plot to wreck his happiness and her own.
But, concealing her thoughts to the best of
her ability, she moved on with him as her solo
partner (luring the rest of the night, niuch to
the distaste of many an officer who would have
shed blood for the honor of having her hand
even in a single dance, and more to the sur-
prise of others, who wondered why her Ameri-
can-hating father should leave her in such
perilous company so long.
But so it was , and when, as the rosy her-
alds of the coming day came swiftly from the
eastern, sea-board, Allen found himself once
more on board of his beautiful schooner, his
heart was too full of the joy of the last few
hours to permit of his thinking of sleep.
There are times of neril as well as times of
trouble, when-sleep will not come to the eve-
lids of the weary ; and there are times when
joy and lmppiness forbids one to close his eyes.
May such sleeplessness be the fate of my read
ers !
CHAPTER VIT.
The Pilot, of Norfolk, the consort,-built
of the Alligator, was indeed a beautiful vi ssel;
and so thought Charley Howard, her ttapo-
rary commander, who was engaged to ta'h: her
to Yera Cruz, there to deliver hice to the Mexi-
can government to act as a privateer. 'He was
in the lahama Channel, heading for the Cu-
ban coast, and in Ehe act of taking Ins meridi-
an observations to learn his latitud.., when a
man forward, on deck (for lie had no look- out
aloft). sang out : " Sail ho !"
Dropping his quadrant, Iloward seized his
spy-glass,'as he cried: "Where away ?"
A point or two to windward of the weather
how, sir-not one, but three sail, if my eyes
don't lie !"
"You're right," said IHoward, as he looked
in the direction given. After a short recon-
noissance, he said. "There are two schooners
and a sloop. I suppose they're Cuban coasters,
for we should be nearly in to the island now.
Luff, there, you at the helm-let her come up
a point, and we'll speak the strangers !"

heading a little to the northward of west, now
hauled more to th .wind and n estward, and as
the vessels which IIoward intended to speak,
were standing on a course which threw them
athwart his bows, they  cry rapidly neared
him.
The young captain of the schooner looked
at theni from time to tiune, but saw nothing
which led hin to believe them to be other than
coasters, as he had at first supposed. But
few men were seen upon theirdeeks, and the
sails were neghgeutly trimniied. as those of the
lazy Cuban droghers uiiially are-and as to
this day you can see them  along that coast ;
they were hugged close up to each other, as if
there wasmore safety in company than in be-
ing apart.
The breeze was not fresh, yet stiff enough
to send the sharp-built schooner some six or
seven knots through the water. In an hour,
or little more, the strange sails were close
aboard, and Iloward shortened sail to speak
them, taking in his foresail and flying-jib, and
throwing his fore-topsail and top-gallant-sail
aback, while he hauled his jib-sheet to wind-
ward.
As his headway deadened, one of the stran-
gers crossed his bow, while the other two
headed directly for him to leeward, all having
Spanish colors set.
"Look oupt there, you lubberly Spanish cubs,
or you'll run afoul of us !" shouted howard,
as he saw the danger of contact.
"Excuse us, Seior Amerieans ; we couldn't
well help it !" cried a tall and sp!enidid-looking
man, who leaped from the bow of the nearest
vessel on to the quarter-deek of the Pilot, and
who was instantly followed by fifty or sixty
men, armed to the teeth, like liimself.
Taken completely I surprise, himself and
his feeble crew  entirely unarmed, Ionard
could offer no resistance.  Yet the proud
Maryland blood in his veins boiled, and angry
light flashed im his eye, as lie looked the lead-
ing intruder in the face, and boldly asked what
the deuce he meant by coming on board of his
vessel so unceremoniously ?     '
We are rough people, Seior Aniericans !"
said the leader ; " and we do not understand
ceremony. But we have need of a fast-sailing
vessel, andl as yours seems to be speedy, we
feel an inclination to try her for a time!"
Then I 'mi to under tand that you're a set
of bloody pirates !" said IIoward, bitterly.
" Oh, no ! by no means, Senor ! We are
gentlemen, f ree Rovers-no more ! We ex-
act tribute, it is true, from  those who come
within our range ; if they are at all obstreper-
ous, we somietunes make them unalk the plank ;
ut if they are accommodating, and give us all
they have with a good grace, why we gener-
ally let them keep the most valueless of their
possessions-hje !"
"Very kind !" said Ioward, bitterly. "And
I suppose "     pare my :rew, now that you

have them unarmed, and entirely in your
power ?"
"Yes; but have you no favor to ask for
yourself?"
"I haye. Will you grant it ?"
"If it is not such a one as will compromise
me as a man, I will !" said the other.
It will prove whether you are a man or
not !"'said Howard. "You wear a sword--I
have one in my cabin ; and all that I ask is a
chance to measure weapons with you on this
deck !"
Time dark eye of the Spaniard flashed, for
the tone of Howard was most insulting. He
paused a moment, anid measured the form of
his intended competitor with a scornful glance.
"Do you know who I am, young Inan ?" he
as'ed, after a delay of a minute or more.
Who you are, T do not know ! But what
you are, I do know. You surely are a pirate,
if you refuse to fight me, you are a coward !"
"No man lives who can call Edward Colce-
frinas a coward the second time !" said the pi-
rate leader, in a quiet tone-dangerous, be-
cause it was so 'quiet. Go and get your
weapon, young man, and if you can conquer
me, you and 3 our vessel shall go seot free !"
" I am contented w th the -condition !" said
the brave young American, and he hastened
to his state-room for his sword, a we on with
which he was not unacq/ainted, an which, in
the hands of his gallan father, ha done good
service in the war.of 1, 12 and '3-,
In a few moments  ie return d, and the pi-
rate leader, in spite f the mm urniured remon-
strance of his men, ho dis iked his unineces-'
sary exposure to anger humpreaed for this
singular and impr mlitu duel.
There was not much parade, for HIoward-"
who cast away the scpbbard of his weapon as
he came on deck, tp show that lie intended to
find another sheath for the blade-at once be-
gan the attack, and that with a skill and im-
petuosity wli h for a tiue rather bothered
the pirate, aid forced him to keep upon his
guard and to act solely on the defensive.
But Howard could not for any length of
time exert so much vigor, and as every lunge
and cut he made was coolly met and parried by
his antagonist, lie soon began to feel that he
had taxed his' powers too heavily at the start.
And by the ease with whi h the pirate met his
most cunning feints and thrusts, he soon felt
that lie had found his master. In a short
time, instead of attacking, he found himself ne-
etssitated t4 stand upon his guard wliout be-
ing able to return a lunge. And as the blood
of the pirate warmed, his bright steel was
more'than once crimsoned with the blood of
his over-matched antagonist. - Yet he inflict-
ed no mortal wound, and only seemed to see
how near lie could come to takmin life without:
doimg i t-as savages do sometimes when tlhef
torture their captives.
"Have you not lost blood enough to cool

your mper, senior ?" at last said the pirate,
as  e beat down the guard of his weakened
o onent, and held him entirely at his mercy.
Howard made no reply, but springing back
to a fresh position, again raised his weapon.
With a skillful turn of his wrist, Colcefri-
nas wrenched the weapon from the hand of
the young American, who unarmed, but yet
unyielding, folded his arms upon his breast,
and awaited the expected death-blow. But it
did not come.
With a quiet smile upon his face, the pirate
thief reached out to the flag which dangled
from the main peak halliards, and wiped his
sword upon it. " Yo'n fence tolerably well,
fbr an American !" said lie to Howard. " When
I have leisure, I will give you some -lessons
which will improve your style. But at pres-
ent I have not time. By the way, a friend of
yours, Lieutenant Allen, of the Alligators, said
that letters for his squadron were expected in
your vess-el. have you a mail on board ?"
"Yes!" said Howard, moodily. "Perhaps
you will take the trouble to deliver the letters
yourself?" he added, tauntingly.
"Most undoubtedly I shall !" said Colcefri-
nas, in a gentle tone. "Lieutenant Allen and
myself are on the most friendly terms. I
wo uld not permit his letters or those addressed
to iny of his officers to be delayed a moment !"
"Allen your friend? Why he is sent out
to hunt up and destroy such bloody pirates
ae you are !"
a Yes-and I am going to help him. He
tcld me how fast your vessel was, and I made
up my mind to procure her for that especial
service"      !"             tt'
"You mock me, sir !"
" You are in error, SeiTor Americano-I- am
vury serious. I expect in a very few days to
see Mr. Allen, and I shall not only deliver his
letters, but tell him that the wicked and re-
morseless pirates have captured the fastest
schooner that has ever worn the Ameiican
flag!"
"Tell him that if Charles IIoward had only
known that pirates were near, lie never would
have been taken alive !" said the American,
bitterly.
"Your message shall be delivered 1" said
Colcefrinas, with a smile. "And now we must
part, for time just at the present is valuable to
me! Is your long-boat in good condition ?"
" Yes ! But why do you ask ?"
" l\Ierely to know if it will stand the voyage
which you and your crew are about to make
in it !"
"So you intend to put us adrift in it ?"
"Yes, senior. You are excellent at guess-
ing !"
'" You will permit us to have provisions,
water, sails and oars, perhaps, in your gener-
osity ?"
"The two first you may have! But I can
only spare you one oar. That wi11 keep your

r

boat head to sea, and if-a gale does not come
up to swamp you, you may be so lucky as to
be picked up by some passing vessel. I may
send your friend Allen to look for you !"
"You are very kind-I hope the d-1 will
reward you in the next world, if you miss your
due in this !" said Howard, in reply.
An hour later, he and his crew in the none
too capacious long-boat of the schooner, were
alone upon the heaving waters of the Gulf
tream, their frail boat steadied by a single
oar, being almost even with the water's edge.
Their only hope of salvation in life was, that
some vessel would pass before a gale should
arise, and pick them up.
CHAPTER VIII
"Well, gentlemen, you who have been so
anxious to see service will soon have a
chanceI" said Lieutenant Allen, one morning,
some ten days after the occurrence of the fes-
tival spoken of in our first chapter. His first
officer had just. reported that three vessels,
American men-of-war, were coming up the
harbor; and as he had only waited the arrival
of these to commence his search for pirates,
he had no further excuse for lingering in that
too enchanting spot.
"Faith, that's blessed news, and good for
the dyspepsy, cap'n dear !" said O'Shaughnes-
sy, the surgeon.
"A disease which will never trouble you,
doctor !" said Allen with a smile.
"That's true, blessed be the knowledge that
keeps it from me !" said the doctor.
"Here is a package of letters for you, sir,
just brought on board by a stranger from
shore, in a small boat !" said a petty officer,
handing the package to Allen.
"Letters from home and by the Pilot!" ex-
claimed the young officer, as he tore open the
package. "Forwarded by Colcefrinas, the
Pirate, with his compliments to Lieutenant
Allen! .Darnation! Where is the messenger
who brought these letters? Bring him to me
instantly !" added the officer, as he read a
scrap of paper which was attached to the pack-
age.
"He rowed away as soon as le handed
the letters over the side, sir! lie did not
come on board at all, and is asho e long be-
fore this time, sir ?" said the petty o 'cer.
Allen made no reply, but tore ope a note
addressed to him in the same hand that the
scrawl was written in, and his face flushed with
anger as he read it. No wonder; its contents
were
"If the Yankee who commands the Alliga-
tor can spare time from his dalliance with the
daughter of Garcia de Regla, and would like
to measure swords with Colcefrinas the Pirate,
he can have an opportunity. The latter has
taken the schooner, Pilot, and thinks her very
well adapted to his business. Not having any
use for the private letters of the officers of the

OUR MESS; OR,

pirate-hunting  squadron, Colcefrinas takes
pleasure in transmitting them to their des-
tination. lie deems it unnecessary to send
the government dispatches which he found in
the Pilot, as he wishes to preserve the auto-
graphs of the Secretary of the Navy, and the
Commandant of the Marine Corps. Colcefri-
nass can be found on his cruising-ground in the
Bahama Channel, and takes this opportunity
to assure Lieutenant Allen of his distinguished
constideratiorn !"
Allen did not hesitate long after perusing
this letter. Turning to his first officer, he
said
"have all ready for sailing in an hour, sir!
1s soon as the other vessels come to an an-
ebor, send a boat on board of each, telling
r;en that I have heard from the pirates, and
shall at once sail in search of themr. I have
tome business on shore, which attended to, I
shall at once weigh anchor. Let the gunner
and armorer look to their stores and see that
nothing is lacking for service when we sail !"
These orders given, Allen sprang into his
gig and was quickly rowed to the shore-where,
giving directions to his crew to remain in the
boat ready for his return, he laid his course
for the palace, whither he went with hurried
steps.
('IHAPrEit LIX
"Youl have sad news for ie! I know it! A
ark cloud has rested, shadow-like, upon my
spirit all the morning, and all the long night
t have twssed restlessly u)otn my couch, an-
noyed with terrible dreams!' said Mararquita
do Regla, as Allen entered her presence but a
fsw moments after he left his boat."
"Not sad news, but good, my love !" he re-
Â°ponded, gayly, " or at least, it is sad in but
on thing -lmust leave you fora time. I ihave
heard from Colcefrinas, the pirate, and if he is
true to his challenge, will soon have the plla-
*ure of meeting him on blue water. Whets he
and his gang are exterminated, then  I will re-
turn to your side ; and it will be your own
fault, my loved one, if we are ever apart again
--for if your father then refuses me your hand,
I know that you will keep your promise, and
be my bride without his consent !"
1 will, if you conic back ! Put, oh ! I so
fear that you never will come ! I feel a pre-
sentimentthat death is near to one, or both of
us !" said the lovely girl, and she clung all
trembling to his arm, as if she would avert the
fate she dreaded, or share it with him.
Aht, lieutenant, i am glad to see you! I
observe that other of your national vessels
rave arrived in our port f" said the father of
Maraquita, entering at this moment, but not
appearing to notice the position of his daugh-
ter, which she changed in an instant, when she
heard his voice.
Yes, Seior Marquis !" replied Allen, "but I

they, as well as myself, will soon be forced by
the stern call of duty to tear ourselves from
the hospitality of your port and town !"
"Why, you surprise me, lieutenant. When
and whither do you sail ?"
"Immediately, and in search of Colcefrinas,
the pirate, who has sent me an audacious chal-
lenge !"
" Colcefrinas ? Sent you a challenge
asked the marquis, in the most utter astonish-
ment.
"Yes, scilor ! And it will not be long, i
hope, before I am ready to make hi   regret
his cool audacity,! By the way where s your
friend Quiestra ?"
"lie? Why do you ask, sir ?" answered the
marquis, very much agitated.
" Because he promised to take a cruise wittr
me, as he knew the coast well and I did not'
"lie is here, and ready to keep his prom-
ise !"'said a deep, full-toned voice ; and as all
three turned toward the open door, the Span-
iard known thera as Quiestra made his ap-
pearance.
The marquis, who had at first seemed sud
denly and greatly agitated,-recovered his pres-
cnce of mind in an instant, and said
"You are welcome back, e ior Quiestra !
have you just arrived from your puantation ?"
"As you can see by the dust of travel on my
person, I have, Seiior Marc uis !''aid the other.
Thdn, turning in the most friendly manner to
Allen, he asked
How go matters with you, amigo io
Prosperous, I hope ?"
" So, so ! But I sail in an hour-do you in-
tend to go with te " replied Allen, to whom
he had spoken.
If you please. A cruise at sea once more
w;ll be a novelty to rme, and iy knowledge of
the coast may he of benefit ti you. But ex-
cuse te a moment, if you please. I have a
message to send back by valet, Mriiano, to my
plantation, and then 1 shall ie ready to attend
you. Marquis, I wouldspeak a word with you
in private, if your leisure will permit it !"
The marqurs followed the Spaniard out, ani
Allen was again left alone with the idol of his
soul, his beloved Maraquita.
")o not trust that man, Quiestra!" said
the latter, the instant they were alone. " .
feel that he meditates some dark evil toward
you !"
"If he does, he will be foiled, for I am ever
upon my guard !" said Alien. " Ite shall not
have it in his power to injure me, and should
he be so foolish as to attempt it, his punish
meat shall be swift and sure !'
In a little time Quiestra returned alone,
being now armed as when we Inst saw him.

ice on this trip, lieutenant, so you seee that I

a friendly smile.

The tone of Allen in the last remark sas
rather interrogative.
 Oh, yes," said Quiestra. " I am fond of ex-
itement. But supposing you were to capture
this Colcefrinas, what would you do with
him?"
"Do with him? Why, hang him to the yard-

" Without trial ?" asked the Spaniard qui-
etly.
Yes! 'What chance does lie give to his un-
fortunate victims! le is a mluriderer, and a

I neither know nor care. I should neither

And yet you might receive it all the sooner

closely.

matched, so far as numbers were concerned.
The two schooners stood on until not more
than two miles apart, and the probability of
their soon being in telling gun-shot of each
other, grew into a certainty. But suddenly,
as sue things ever come in that coquettish
latitude, signs of squalls coining from the
westward were seen, and the Pilot hove about
and headed in for her former berth.
"She declines to meet me 1" muttered Al-
len, bitterly. "This olcefrinas is a cowardA "
"'Prudence is not cowardice, sir !" said Qui-
estra, who stood by his side. "You had bet-
ter take in your canvas quickly, or he will
have to show his getnerosity by rescuing a
shipwrecked erew before sunset."
"What do you mean ?" asked the lieuten-
ant.
"That a white squall is sweeping down
upon us, and the sooner sheets and halliards
are flying the less trouble you'll have !" said
the Spaiiard,
"A dark squall, rather than a white one !"
muttered Allen, as almost in an instant black
driving clouds seemed to shroud sky and wa-
ter. ie had given orders barely in time to
save his canvas and spars, for while the men
were aloft tking in the one, and the schooner
obeying her helm, was heading off shore soJ
as to take the wind abaft, it came like the
ebullitions of Irish friendship--in a gush--
such a one as would have laid the schoonerI
on her beam-ends if she had not been so well
handled as she was.
It came like the charge of a mounted army,
sullen and heavy, wild but steady, swueeping'
overthe inhuid ivaters which had been calm,i
and lifting them up in frothy foam. It came
like the first angry hurst of a man in power,
who knows ihat his power is not "for all time,'
but for a moment, pierce, wild, but began to  t
flicker away before its first rude thunders had
died into echoes.t

were on duty.                       u   a

"I know it. Give your courses, and they
will be followed !"
" Set her head west and by north now,"
said Quiestra. Keep your lead going. When
you shoal to four fathoms let me know. Mean-
time, if you please, I'll go to my state-room,
and fool at an old chart which 1shate there.
" That man seems honest, and I must trust

scarcely' been lost s ght of, before a Spanish
rmcrchartman  came in, having  on  board
(harley Howard, and the crew of the 'ilot,
whom they had picked up. fortuaatily. The
American connander Irurred to his consu
to state the occurrenici"s whit-h had deprived
him of his vessel; and be the advice of the
latter, who accompanied n, he at once pi'o-
"ceded to inform tre Intendente-(, nercal of the
same.
The marquis did not seem at all startled by
the news, for news it was not to him. Hl" knew
it already. le merely replied
"There is a scruadron on the cet, of ru m'
own countrymen, and they may recover your
vessel!"4
"So I hear, and I'm off to help thin, if your
excellency will only let me have one of your
small guarda costas; and some aris. My
crew will be but too glad to measure strength
with the bloody pirates on fair chances
I have no vessel which I can spare," re-
plied the mard uis to Howard, coldly.
"Then let me have some arms. I will fit up
my long-boat-she can run down the coast!"
urged the young American.
" Armed boats without a license arc not
allowed on our coast!" said the marquis, evas-
ively.       -.
"Allowed or not, there are plenty of them,
as our suffering merohantmen know !" said the
consul, in a sarcastic tone.
"Not when or where it is in our power to
prevent it !" replied the marquis, haughtily.
"Captain, I uns sorry for your misfortunes,
but as you are in tire hands of your own eon-
sa, any offer's of aid on my part will only be
taking fromt him his prerogatives ! Adieu-I
amrr very imuch irgaged this afternoon."
This was said iin a tone which implied their
dismissal. Howard went away angry at this
discourtesy, but the consul had become so'
used to such treatment, from the san source,
that he paid but little attention to it.
"Have you not weapons to arm myself and
boat's crew ?" asked tire seaman of the consul.
"I regret to say that I have not !"
"You can at least tell me where they can be
bought !"
"Prhey cannot be had in this place without
a written permit from the alcalde. Such is the
rule all over this tvraut-ridden isle !"

"If you are as boll and fearless as you look
to be and will take me for a volunteer, I will
show yOU how to get, not only weapons. but a
swift-samling vessel 1" sa-l a cleas anti musical
voice close behind tihons.
t Both lowar'd an the consul turned suid-
dery to tee where and who the speaker was,
who evxideutly had been following then, and
had "'verheard their conversation, or he would
not have known :hoir wan s.
lie was young and slender boy---evidently
not .ore than seventeen or ciliteen, with a
very dark compulexion, and a brow almost hid-
d' under a heavy mass of black hluir. Ils
dres was like that of the better class of serv-
ant   r in gentlemen's houses in that country.
ws    but few white servants are seen.
" ew do you know that I want a vessel
and arms?" asked Holvard, sternly. "And
why aceyo vadogiing our. footsteps ?"
SBecause I happen to be in a position
where, unseen, I witne,'ssed your interview with
tIe alalie--heard your story and dernanis.
antl his refusal. I folow you to serve you, for
I can do it. I also wish to go down the coast
with you, to give LUentensa, Allen soume very
important information, which wiil enable him
to capture, the chief of the iratical horde
whom he is after "
What, Coleer''inias ?" exlaimed Howard.
Yes, tix' !" said the yonthw, frankly.
"  Then I'm with you, young man, if you
lead to the devil's own den!t"
" Who are you?    Your face is not familiar
to me, and yet it seems as if I had seen you
before !" said the consul.
" It matters inot who I air, Seiior Consul !
said the youth. " I know you very'well, and I
ans a friend to the North Americarns!"
"Whr'tere is the vessel you intend ie to take,
and where can we get arms?" asked Iloward.
" I shall with your aid hor row the alcalde's
private yacht. It is Ariean built, and fast,
and he always keeps plenty of arms on board.
It is never fully manned, except when he goes
on a pleasure-trip, and is moored off the pal-
ace-garden. We cars get her away at night, if
we are careful and you are skillful, and be at
sea long before she is missed !"
"You're a trump, and I'm the man to plav
the game out With our help !" said Ilowari
gayly. " When and where will you meet me
and my crew to put our plrian in operation ?'
"At the consuls house, as soon as it is
dark !" said the young' uran  andi turning on
his heel, he went lack the way that he. had)
come.
" Well, fortune seems on the change for
me !" said Howard, in a better humor than
when the alcalde dismissed them.
"Yes, if tlris young man speaks the truth.
I am trying to think whern and where I have
seen Rims before, for I am sure 1 have met hins
somewhere !" replied  theconsul, as they

CHAPTER XVIIL
When the morning dawned once more on the
Alligat or, Allen was called, as he had directed.
wh'n he came on deck, the land-breeze was
blowing   mxlv, bringing off the delicious per-
fumes of tialffowery clime. But in vain did
he and the watoh look for the vessels which
they had seen the night before. N ot a sign of
theim, or of anything human, could be seen.
The small isaids which dotted the water as
far to the catward as the eye could reach,
were coered with a tail growth of mangrove,
nd t I swoodis, and among these, in channels
well known to them, but not laid down at that
day in an chart, they had undoubtedly found
'"Thi Coleefrinas was very bold on paper.
I do ot see why he should avoid me now, that
I.  a It I!" mittertl Allen, in a tone of dis-
ap prinnnt , while he lowered the glass which
he dt bll this eye for for some time.
iraips he wants to draw you into sonic
pmitio twelinee your retreat will be a matter
of liflieult v, if not an impossibility !" said a
quiet voice, at his elbow.
'ihe young lieutenant's face flushed, as he
recogt/izcd tie speaker, and he said
I would have the Seiior Quiestra to under-
stand that I siall never retreat. There is-not
an otlieter or iani of all my crew who would
not scoro to turn his back oin a bloody pirate,
and who would nrot die at his post, rattier than
do so. But the vessels which we saw last
might eanuot he far away. There has been but
little wind all night, and even with sweeps
they could have gone no great distance. They
imust hbtsome where among these islands, mind
I shall man mv boats and try to hunt them up !"
The rpaniardI smiled, but made no answer.
At the samiie moment, the eye of the young
A      urn t htened, for white and clear a1
column o suioke rose from an island, not a
league distant.
Â°.Man the first, second, and third cutters !"
cried Alien}, instantly. " Let every man go
fully armed, and put spare ammunition in the
boats. lie in a hurry !"
While he yet was speaking, another, and
then another column of smoke rose from other
islethi, a Iit least twenty of them could be
5.--
1Ini hab, sir, that you said .these islands
were unilbh ited!" cried Allen, turning to
Qoiestra.
I repeat it,''that they are not. Colcefrinas
is amusing himself at your expense. He in-
tends tt itari you the game of hide and seel,
I presum . I will wager that you will pull
front island  island, all day, and yet not see
a living nui on any of them!"
Yet mcii have lighted those fires!l"
"Yes-tien or women! But it is not likely
they'll care0t oanmain near them on so warm a
day as ti l'
"I'll s"ott see !" said Allen, and he ordered

every boat on board to be got ready for serv-
ice, and prepared to go himself in his gig.
" Are von not going to join our boat expe,
dition, secor ?" asked he of Quiestra.
"If 1 thought you'd catch Coleefrinas, I
would !" said the Spaniard. " But feeling
sure that you will not, I think I shall be more
comfortable with my cigar, under your awn-
ing, than I should be sweltering in a boat,
and fighting musquitos among the islands !"
As you like, sir-as you like !" said Allen,'
secretly thinking that, despite his fierce looks,
the seior was not much of a fighting-man
after all.
In less than a half-hour, Allen, with more
than four fifths of his men in every boat be-
longing to the vessel, was pulling away toward
the island. And Quiestra smiled grimly as
he saw them   depart, for well he knew how
fruitless would be their toilsome search.
Every officer had been a volunteer on this
occasion ; and all were allowed to go but the
1lethoric and rather apoplectic-looking doe-
:tor, who, under orders, was quite willing to re-
main upon the vessel, beneath a cool awning,
where he could indulge in his favorite drink,
cold brandy punch, to his heart's cohtent. For
he had laid in a good quantity of lemons,
brandy, and sugar, and the vessel was well
provided with water-coolers-that most neces-
sary' article in such a climate.
The orders of Allen to the doctor, when he
left, were to keep the few men he left him on
the alert, and to fire a gun if any sails hove in
sight. lie was to remain on deck, and also to
keep a look-out aloft.
' And am I to be cap'n ?" asked the doctor,
of Allen.
"You are to act as such in my absence.
Remember that every gun is loaded ; and if
you should be attacked, defend yourself to the
last, and blow up the magazine before you
suffer yourself to be taken. If-you don't, I'll
blow you up if we ever meet on earth, or e'en
in a hotter place !"-
S" How long d'ye mane to be gone, cap'n
dear ?" asked O'Shaughnessy.
"I know not. Notlong, I hope; for I expect
soon to find these audacious villains, and mean
to make short work with them."
A sardonic sneer flitted over the face of Qui-
estra, but it was tiot noticed, for his head
was turned in another direction. And in five
minutes more Allen and all the boa's' crews
were gone, aail soon lopt to sight among'the
islands.
"There goes as good a -heart as ever bate
beneath a blue coat!" said O'3haughness, as
he gazed after his departing leader. "I hope
the.day is a long way off that calls him out o'
the world. Let's drink his health, senior "
"With pleasure, but you. must drink it In
some choice old liquor that I brought on
board with my stores. It is Castillian brandy,
bottled forty years ago !"

quidistnnt from the schooner, and, showing
merucan colors, caine on rather faster than

lowing up their canvas, when Allen dashed

schooner, nor a uld a single living person be
een.
It is unnecessary for us to re-describe the
ppearance of the doctor and the crew, but as
e left them in a former chapter, so Allen
found them.
lIe was too angry to laugh - too much
mazed to feel diverted ; but as he seized the
yet stupCtied doctor by the shoulder and shook
him, he asked, in his loudest, bitterest tone
"What does this masquerade mean, sir
Speak ! what does it meanu .

as with his knife he severed the doctor's bomd.
while the boats' crews crowding aboard ende-
vored but in vain to stitle their laugtaliter at the
sight before thema.
The holy sants only know, and it's theu
you'll have to ask for information . exclaimed
the doctor, as he looked at his p"ron fons
head to foot.

While the doctor was considering this mst
pertinent question, tie mien who had just comn'
on board were releasiug their comrades from
their bonds. Allen, meanwhile, whose eye had
caught a sight of the note beneath the flag,
was perusing to him its iinexplicablec on-
tents.
" Quiestra has been taken away, and Colce-
forina s himself his been on board according to
this note," he cried. " But who on heart h can be
the dearer friend whom ae speaks of f? By
lietaveas, there is a deep mystery inmall this
which I would fam unravell" he added, in a
lower tone.
" Every gun is spiii, all of our saill arsa
are gone, mid the Amaazte has been emptied.
sir," reported the fit -lieutenait to Allen.
"The whole vessel has - eu ruansacked, and
robbed of everything vtl1uad."
" And she is leaking, iri ; there are three
feet of water in the hol,' said the carpenter,
who had just been sounding the puitips.

.o      " The infernal wretch ! Why did he not
sink the vessel while she was in his power, in-
stead of merely disabling ?" muttered Allen,
angrily. Then turning to the lieutenant, he
bade him1 put one watch of the crew at the
pumps-told the carpenter to seek out and
try to stop the leaks, and then bade the other
men help to free their unfortunate comrades
from the disagreeable garments left on them by
Colcefrinas.
The doctor had already disappeared in the
direction of his ci ate-room--whence his voice,
heard in low and bitter oaths, and in calls up-
on his servant for sponge, brushes, spirits of
turpentine, and brandy, gave token that he

Allen had but just ordered the ensign to be
hoisted up properly, Ihen boats approached
from his consort vessels with their respective
conmades in them.
What in Heaven's name is the matter here,
Allen ?" asked the first ollicer who sprung on
board.
Nothing, but that Pvo been a egregrious
fool !" said Allen. " Nothing else n the world.

"Does he know where I am ?"
"lie knows that you are my guest."
"And is he content with that knowledge ?"
" Perfectly ; but would like to see you as
soon as convenient after you have become my
wife. Why do you smile, fair lady, so mock-
ingly, ?"
"It amuses me to notice with what grace
you can utter falsehoods."
"But, by heaven ! I utter the truth. You
smile again !"
"Yes, to hear you swear by a place of which
you know nothing now, and which will never
know anything of you !"
"You seem determined to provoke me! It
is rather a dangerous amusement, as you may
find to your cost."
"Those who do not fear danger, never pause
to count the cost."
"And so you do not fear me ?"
"We are not apt to fear those whom we
despise !"
"Girl, beware ! Do not tempt my good-
nature too far!"
"Your good-nature ! Let the ape boast of
its beauty-the serpent of its harmlessness,
after this !"
"You will regret this, proud girl; but I will
not war in words with you now. When next
we meet, prelpme for two pleasant surprises.
I shall bring you two presents: one will be
your wedding-ring-the other, the head of
your heart's husband Z"
With a frown darker yet than his threats,
the pirate turned away, and strode heavily
from the room.
After the sound of his footsteps had died
away entirely, Mariano came out from  his
place of concealment.
"You bore yourself bravely, lady-almost
too bravely, [fear ; for he will suspect some
hope has cheered your heart-some thought
that you may yet escape," said he.
"No; he will, rather, think that my $espe-
ration has forced away from my heart all fear
of him, and that I am' provoking him to slay
me !" said the lady. "But what did he mean
'by saying that he had Allen in his power-or
woul have, in three days ?"
"That a challenge has passed between them
to meet upon the ocean, vessa~r to vessel."

"-Then I fear not the result. Allen will be
the victor !"
"Were it not for treachery, lady, he might."
"For treachery? What do you mean ?"
"That your own father, lady, who supplies
Allen with his powder and arms, is to give
him a worthless.article ; and thus the Ameri-
can will be in the power of Coleefrinas !"
"Great Heaven ! Oh, do not say that my
father will be guilty of such an act ! It can-
not-must not be 1"
"Alas, lady, it doubtless has been done,
and the gallant American is by this time at
sea, proceeding to the spot where my master
is to meet him."
"Oh, cruel, cruel butchery !  This must
not be. Mariano, he must be warned in some
way. Can I not be set free-or, in some dis-
guise, get on board the vessel of your master
-so that, if I :cannot save him whom I love,
I can at least die with or near him!"
Mariano shook his'head mournfully, as if to
imply that it was impossible.
Tears started in those black eyes, which so
lately had flashed back glance for glance with
the haughty pirate.
"0 Mariano, you have never loved !" said
Maraquita, with a low sob of agony.
"Would to Heaven I never had-did not !"
said Mariano ; and never did a deeper blush
suffuse the cheek of a timid girl, than for a
moment reddened his.
A light step at the door-a  w "hist"-
was heard.
"I am called ; your sentinel, who is my
friend, has given me my warning !" said Marr-
ano, hastily. "If I can see you or aid you
again, I will."
,lie bowed his head, and kissed Maraquita's
band; then, in a moment, was gone.
When she raised her hand, and saw that he
b"ad left a tear-drop there, she wondered, but
only said:
"It is a jewel. All that I have. A gem of
pity. heaven help him whom I love ! Hea-
ven help me !"
And again she paled, and drooped down as
despairingly as we found her when we opened
this chapter.
ChAPTER XXIIL
Once more at the rendezvous. The harbor
was full of small boats, and there were several
more of the sloops and schooners in than were
there when we first described the place. And
by the number of men aboard and on shore,
not less than a thousand, perchance one-half
as many more, it was evident . that the pirates
had been driven in by the vigilance of the
cruisers outside, and were collected either for
some formidable foray, or else for the purpose
of making a last and a desperate defence. The
latter, indeed, seemed most probable, for all of
the vessels, with one execution, were moored

to their harbor. The exception alluded to nas
the beautiful clipper which the pirate-chief
ald talon from Iloward, and'which so nearly

b0 )iwing to waft her out to sea. The sain was

There was no sound of cheerine bitt imany
irighit blade waved inl the air,'iany a low
word of cheer fell ot his ear. Douhtls-, pren-
deuce had caused an order for this unusual si-
len'ce ; for with the breeze the sound if a thou-
sand or more lusty.voices would be borne al-
imost as far as the booming of a gun.
Coleefrinas was soon upon his deck, thlow
word of command was given, the anchor ran
up, and, as if by magic, every sail was hoisted
nl sheeted home at once ; and gracefully the
schooner veered away toward the narrow en-
trance, seeinlug to iove over, rather than
through the water. Er the gray of twilight
had darkened upon the bloom of sunset, the
vessel had passed from view, and then the metn
who were left behind returned to their usual
patimes when at leisure-cards, dice, doni-

enthusiasm with which they received his an-
nounneenicat of the challenge of Ciolcifrinas and
his acceptance thereof. Cheer followed cheer,

We can scarcely keep steerage way on her,"
said the oiicer of the deck.
1  We shall have more than we want before
itmany hours, if the weather don't belie its
looks," said Allen, as he glanced off to the
northwest, where a range of clouds lay heavy
and dark, hike some vast machine of lestrue-
tion, waiting but a touch to set it in motion,
or a huge army which needed but the word of
#'         command to send it onward to its terrible work
gof death.
The old quarte'-nmaster, Marston, was at the
bel, and more than once already his eye had
ibeen turned toward that cloud-bank. Allen
noticed it, and with a familiarity which lie
sometimes used toward his oldest and best
m110en, asked
" What does that look like to you, Mars'
ton?"
It looks as if wouldd come heavy and not
go down all at once, sir ! We come anigh los-

chap a little to the east'ard of the hole in the
wall, and had to send for it. hIow we got

After a long fizzle, the powder in the guns
burned with barely sufficient force to throw
the ball out, but not far enough to do damage
at half pistol shtt.
" What can this mean, sir'?" crild Allen, an-
grily, to the first-lieutenant. "That powder hit

The trial was made, and each gun proved
the utter worthlessness of the load.
"Let the gunner be sent for," said Allen, as
he paced ump and down the quarter-deck.
That person soon made his appearance,
"What is the matter with our powder, Mr.

Nothing that Iknow of, sir--it is itt the

Ihfaxing had his 'ss el b1ou1ght1- s11 itter'ly
head to the coniug gale, by the use ofLsweeps,
as could he done, Allen-with a ean twice and

comig ; now glancing    to the   southward,
where, the pirate, at last, was hurriedly short-
euing sad-and then looking to windward, to
see how soon the storm-king would be down
upon fon.
Not long had he to wait. Its distant roar,
like the tumultuous voics of auuimberless
multitude of mnaddene~d men, eang~ sweeping
over the waters ; the light fled from before its
ehon front ; the wat ers rose i a wall of foamy
ihite, as they felt its strong breath ; and the
oldest of those hardy seamen looked for a
sitr or a rope to clut cl lwhen it' gale should
strike their brave yet feteble craft.
"lod on all ! Two men at t10helmeh, and
when she 'veers, let her go before it. Let a

OUR MESS; OR,

THE PIRATE-HUNTERS OF THE GULF.

in a darkness almost as dense as that of night,
while Allen and his officers kept close watch
for the pirate ; for the course upon which
they were driven was nearly or quite toward
where he had last been seen. Suddenly, close
aboard on their starboard hand, she was seen,
but for an instant: an almost dismantled hulk
--her hull encumbered with the wreck of
spars and tattered sails, yet driving in the
same direction as themselves.
Allen had time only to get a glance at the
face of Colcefrinas, who, white with rage,
shook his hand at him as they passed ; and
then they were separated, to meet again-
when, neither knew.
By signs, Allen now caused the crew to take
in both the main and foresail ; and had he
dared, lie would have brought the vessel by
the wind-for he asked no more now than a
chance to meet Iis foe, while his vessel was so
crippled that it could be boarded by Allen
without exposing the crew of the latter to the
batteries of the well-munitioned foe. But the
hurricane was ins its strength still, and no ves-
sel could have done otherwise than se d he-
fore it. his only hope was that it might lull in
time for him to take aback track, before his
enemy could so repair Iis craft as to be able to
work and manouvre his vessel. But on through
the long night she flew, until the noon of the
next day, when the wind died away into a gen-
tier gale ; and well indeed was it for that
brave crew that it (lid: for scarcely had a man
stepped above the rail when the welcome order
to make sail was given, than the cry of "land
ho l" was heard.
And there it was-the rock-bound coast of
Cuba--so close aboard, that two hours more
of that hurricane would have driven the brave
schooner upon it: and that would have been
the end of ier and hers.
-"It seems to me that this part of the coast.
looks familiar, sir," said the first lieutenant to
the young commander, as both were surveying
it through their spy-glasses.
"I know it well," said Allen ; "but where
our consorts have found a harbor is a mystery
to me. I can see the channel where they
were when we sailed, and the sea breaks high
upon the reefs which acted as a breakwater
there. But I see no sign of a vessel in shore
anywhere."
"Perhaps they have found a harbor under
the lee of s me of the islands near. I know
that neither Gregory nor Kearney would break
their promise not to leave, without they were
forced to do it by stress of weather."
"True. Fire a gun, and perhaps it will be
heard and answered by them!" said Allen.
"You forget, sir, that our powder won't
burn," said the lieutenant, with a smile.
"I do not forget, though, that I have a
small keg of Duponts prime rifle-powder in
my state-room, bought for my own private
use. Take that," replied Allen.
In a little while, a gun was loaded with this

powder, and its heavy report went thundering
over the water.
And not more than five minutes had elapsed
before an answering gun was heard, away in
shore, among the islands ; and soon a boat
was discovered making out from behind a
point toward the old anchorage. At about
the same time, a man who was aloft, fiddig
the main-royal-mast, sang out that he saw the
masts of vessels over the tree-tops ahead.
"All is right yet," said Allen. " As powder
is all we want, we can get it from them, and
stand out yet and catch our adversary, before
he knows that we have changed our ha lpow-
der for good, and his very suprise will n eaken
him."
"True, sir. We are indeed fortune-favored
on this cruise. Shall I make more sail-"
"No ; stand i, under easy canvas, till we
speak the boat. Perchance they can pilot us
into a better harbor, where a right s rest for
the crew and a chance to tauten our stretch-
ed rigging will not lessen our efficiency !"
In a short time the schooner reached the
anchorage, where the boat boarded her, prov-
iug to be one from  one of the other vessels,
which had foun .1 safe anchorage in a snmal bay
between the islands, and out-rode the gale
without a strain upon their cables. A hei at
once decided to run im there, and make his
preparations for going to sea with his consorts
i the morning-confident that the pirate could
not escape all three, if they took different
courses to intercept him ; for now, iii conse-
quence of the treachery in Iis supply of pow-
der, evidently known to, if not concocted by
Colcefrinas, he felt himself freed from all con-
ditionus to meet him singly, and itended-as
he had done at first-to hunt hun out nmsd de-
stroy hinm as he would a bloodhound, or any
other cruel, wortkless, and merciless least.
CHAPTER XXVII,
When, from his keen-eyed look-out aloft.
Colcefrinas first heard that the island of his
challenged battle-ground was in sighi, and also
that a sail which well he knew was the Alhi-
gator was also on the ground, his boy wars
more like that of a savage than a mi an. lIe
ordered a cask of brandy brought on deck,
and the head to be strived in. Then, with his
own hands, he stirred in pound after ponl of
gunpowder, a ter the manner of the old bue-
caneers, whose actions he loved but too well
to uitate ir more ways than one r; and drink-
rig first himself, bade each of the crew follow
irs example.
"  lere "-re cried, holding a drimking-cup
only used by him on such occasions as this, or
after some fearful battk--a cup composed of a
nUMAN SKULL-'' here is that we rmy drmik
the blood of our Yankee foes erc the un sets
ji the west, os' fie sup with the devil ir 13rim-
stone Hall below !"
With fiendish shouts tire pirate e--Crouwedd
up, and from that well-known cup, w itimure

than once had been reddened by the tide of
life, they followed their leader's draught and
toast!  And then they danced and sang
like demons, and drank until they were mad-
dened into tigers rather than men-if men they
ever were.
Meanwhile, Coleefrinas raved, and stamped,
and swore, because the wind did not blow
stronger to carry him more quickly to the
place where he supposed his victim would fall
into his power.
The curses of bad men avail not much-at
least this was the case with Colcefrinas, for the
more he stormed the less the wind blew, until
at last it died away, and his vessel rocked idly
in the calm. The look-out, who had come
down from aloft to get his allowance of grog,
had not noticed the taking in of canvas on
board the A merican, nor had any of the offi-
ers or crew been sufficiently observant to see
the now swift-rising storm.
And they had drank ; and Coleefrinas would
have raved until it had been upon them all
unprepared, probably, had not a new idea
struck his mind.
" We will board them in our boats !" he
cried. " They have no powder to hurt us, and
we can cut their throats like dogs as they are !"
Again and again the crew cheered ; pnd
Colcefrinas raised his glass to see how far
away she was. At first, he could not see her,
for. her 'canvas had been reduced, and she
seemed but a speck on the yet glassy sea-no
larger than a gull resting on its bosom. But
when he did, and saw that she had not only
shortened sail, but was also sending down her
upper spars, his seaman's sense at once return-
ing to him told him the reason, and a quick
glance at the swift-coming storm also made
him aware of the peril to his own craIt.
"Silence, fore and adft!" he shouted. "Let go
sheets and halliards by the run. Clew up,
brail up, haul down, and furl everything.
Work, curse youwork, or the storm will do
the work for you!1"
The men, thus urged by one who sel
dons spoke so much without dire necessity,
sprung to 'their work as rapidly as they could.
But some were half-helpless from drink; for
though combat would have manddened them,
they had no moral courage to meet this new
danger, and their brute strength left them,
The sheets and halliards were let go in a mo-
mrent, nod ninny men sprung aloft to furl the
sail. But before this could be half done, the
gale was upon them, and though their chief
shouted to them to lay down from aloft and
save themselves, not half wio went up could
do it, before the fierce storm came crashing,
with 'its thundering force, along--shivering
spars and rending sails like reeds and rotten
fibres with its breath. And men and spars,.
Went together over into the seething foans, and
the staunch vessel would herself inevitably
have gne under, had she not by clhnnce-drift

47

have happened to be heading directly from the
storm when it struck her. She buried for a
moment ; then, as her weight of spars went over
her bows, she staggered up, and, with all their
weight clinging to and clogging her hull, wal-
lowed on amid the fearful chaos bf the tempest
In terror at the fate of so many of their
comrades, and appalled by the suddenness of
the peril, the crew-who were left worked but
feebly in clearing away the wreck. She was
in this condition when, light and free, guided
like a bird before the wind, the American
schooner, which they had almost deemed their
prize, flew by them-their colors aloft, their
crew safe, their officers exultant, even amid the
storm.
Colcefrinas was almost mad enough to slave
himself, He shook his clenched fist at the
passing vessel, and shouted out his bitterest
curses ; but they eould  t rise even to his
own ear above the wild roar of the hurricane
And a moment later, the vessel was far ahead
in the gloom. le glanced at the compass a
moment, and muttered : "Let it blow so for
ten or twelve hours more, and her bones will
grate on Cuban rocks 1"
Then, with some of his best men under hi
immediate eye, he set to 'ork, with a seaman's
skill, to clear away the spars that were adrift
and to get the noble craft beneath him inte
something like working order.
CHAPTER XXVIUl.
In that grand but gloomy cavern-home-or
prison, should 1 call it - poor Maraquita de
Regla hardly knew the difference between day
and night, except as she might judge by the
time when two black mutes--or mutes they
seemed to be ; for they never spoke to her
except by signs-brought her food and drink.
No time-piece was there amid all the rest of
the luxurious furniture ; and if there had been
she would have paid but little note to time,
except to feel that the hours were terribly
wearisome and long.
One night-she judged 'twas night, because
some hours before her supper had been
brought-she woke from an uneasy slumber.
and started--for above her couch bent a tall
and stately woman, of rare and queenly beauty.
She was not regarding her with a look of extra-
ordinary kindness, nor yet with an expression
apparently other than that of curiosity. low
she came there, from whence, and for what
pumrpose-who she was, were all questions im-
mediately asked in Maraquita's mind; but not
responded to. The poor girl haud again some-
what drooped since Mariaano's last interview
with her ; for hope's is but a flickering fire,
and must be fed constantly to burn brightly.
Maraquita was about to speak, but the stran-
ger anticipated her:
"Do you love Eduardo Coleefrinas ?" she
asked.
" No I I loathe rhn " was the ready reply

OUR MESS; OR,

an involuntary cheer burst from every throat,
for the men seemed to think no other vessel
could be in their path thai that for which
they were in search.
On. more, and this time with.a heart beat-
ing strong with hope and ambition, Allen gave
the'"der to teat to quiartrs, and the men and
officer.  rang to their stations with an alac-
rity which proved their anxiety to be at
work to be at least equal to his own. The men
were at once put to exercise, while the vessel
rapidly clove the water in the direction of the
just-dnecovered sail.
Allen, taking his telescope, went forward to
examine her, and when he saw that it was a
vessel almost entirely dismantled, he did not
doubt but that it was the pirate ; but wonder-
,d why a man like Colcefrinas should not
have sooner got up jury-masts and put her
into something like working order.
While he was ints cogitating, the look-out
aloft announced another sail in sight, a little
$          to windward of the first ; and without having
occasion to awk any'questions, -Allen at once
.ow the other stranger, -which appeared to
have been under little or no canvas, and had
thus been unnotice . Bun now, as if by magic,
her taut spars were covered with canvas,
and she seemed to haul up on the same course
which the Alligator was heading.
Allen didl not need superhuman sagacity
to understand how matters stood. He recog-
nized the " Pilot" by her build and rig in a
moment., and knew ~mtuitiv, lv that the dis-
mantled vessel was some fortunate mer-
olhantman which had been taken by the pirate-
perhaps been entrapped by her signals of dis-
tress, and her spars, sails, rigging, etc., used
to refl~t the storm-disabled schooner.
But sad as the t ought was, that the crew
of the merchantnan might have perished, per-
haps even then lay bleeding on her decks, Al-
len only joyed at the sight of the vessel be-
yond, and in his hones soon to have her under
his batteries. But'why, when thus evidently
ready for action, she should fly from him in-
steal of awaiting his approach, at first aston-
ished him; but comprehending that the sails
of his consorts were in sight yet, his wonder
eeassd ; and that especial y,"when he saw
that they had altered their courses, and had
hauled on a wind in his direction. He now re-
gretted that he had not left them at their an-
ehorage and sought the adventure alone. But
it was too late for regrets. Having the retreat
beat, he directed the energies of officers and
men to trimming the sails and doing all that
could be done to increase his speed. The en-
emy was at least five or six miles to windward;
and well he knew that the chase would be a
long one if Colcefrinasso willed it-for the two
vessels, if trimmed aright, were nearly equals.
- aIn less than an hour from the time when
she was first sighted, Allen was close along-
side of the dismantled vessel, which proved, as
he supposed, an American     merchantman,

schooner rigged and Baltimore built ; and she
had served but too good a purpose for the pi-
rate when she fell into his power. Not ai hv-
ing soul from her greeted the approach of the
man-of-war, and Allen was too eager in his
chase to pause to board her. That he left for
his slower-sailing consorts to do. But he ran
so close that he and his crew could see the
dead bodies of the butchered men, who had
composed the crew of the unfortunate vessel,
and more than one oath was reistered to
avenge the 'hapless creatures.
The breeze grew fresher as the vessels stood
off, and they soon had all they could do to
carry top-gallant sails with "a clear full " on,
and the white caps danced merrily on the
crests of the huge blue waves.
From time to time Allen sighted the dis-
tance between the two vessels with his sextant,
to see if he gained ; and frequently was he
tempted to fire a challenging gun'to wind-
ward, to try and taunt his foe into bringing to
for battle. But he wished, so long as lie could,
to keep the latter from becoming aware that
he had good powder on l1oard; and as he was
very fast dropping his consorts astern, he
hoped every hour to see the pirate heave to
and give him a chance to close.
But night was fast approaching, and lie be-
gan to fear that the'wily villain intended in-
(Ieed to fly, and in the coming darkness might
escape, when, while yet the sun was an half
hour or more high, and the rails of his con-
sorts almost out of sight astern, the pirate was
seen to take in his top-gallantsail, biil up his
foresail, and make a show of preparation for
action, by running off with the wind a little
free.
Cheers broke from the lips of the American
crew when they saw this, for they felt that the
ong-desired hour was now at hand.
"Oh, for a few hours more of daylight!"
muttered Allen, to himself, as lie glanced at
the height of the sun.
"She will be ours before dark, sir I" ! d
the first lieutenant, who had overheard his ex-
pression.
"Perhaps-but if she tries yet to escape
us, the coming darkness will favor her. Her
escape is all that I fear !" replied Allen.
Still standing can under a press of canvas,
the Alligator was soon within gunshot of the
pirate ; and then Allen began to trim in"his
canvas for work. The enemy did not opens
fire, undoubtedly waiting for Allen to try his
poor powder first ; but the latter determining
to hide the advantage which he knew lie had,
held his fire also ; and just as the sun began
to dip beneath the western waters, ranged
along the weather-beam of the pirate,. and+
within hailing distance.
Colcefrinas, dressed magnificently, stood'on.
the weather-rail of his vessel, and hailing,'said':
"I am waiting for you to open the ballwith,
a salute, my gallant Yankee I"

OUI MESS; OR,

TIHE PIRATE-IUNTERS OF THE GULF.

Allen, and at a wave of his hand, to the utter
astonishment of the pirate, a crashing broad-
sie was poured into him, of shot not sent by
Mzatanas powder.
"Hell aind furies! .l)e Regla has played me
fihise !" shouted Colcefrinas,as he sprung to
the helm himself, to put it hard-a-lee, to save
his vessel from being raked by the American,
which was wearing around his stern, while the
umn were hurriedly reloading the batteries
jut firedd"
And the pirates, who, taken altogether by
surprise, at first were panic-struek, now sprung
to their guns ; and on both sides the firing be-
came hot and lieavy
And now the skill of the two commanders,
as well as their bravery, was brought into
play. Allen, finding that he could not so ma-
nouvre as to rake his wily foe, sought to make
the conlict brief by boarding him. But Col-
refrinas, much as lie would have desired it had
his crew been full, had lost too many men in
the storm, and in the unexpected broadside,
to risk a hand-to-hand encounter; and he only
sought to hold his own until night set in,
that lie aight escape in the darkness. Pass-
ing forward among his gunners the order to
cripple the American in his spars, he nianaged
by skillful manouvres to buffle Allen in every
attempt to getalongside. The gunners of the
Alligator, only thinking of sending as many
pirates as they could to eternity, poured in
their grape and canister, and it was not until
it was too late that Allen found that only
round and chain shot were returned, to knock
sway his spurs and cut his rigging.
Darkness had come on, although from the
veryP commencement of the action both vessels
hid been in the darkness of a cloud of smoke,
when suddenly the lime of the pirate ceased-
although it had been tremendously heavy
until the very instant before it stopped.
"She has surrendered !" shouted many a
voice on board the American; and more than
one dying tar lifted his head to hear those
words-more than one man sorely wounded
ceased his groans, as they heard the cry.
But poor Allen, who though twice wound-
ed would not leave the deck, gnashed his
teeth in very anger at this silence, for he knew
that his almost conquered foe was creeping
away from him under cover of the night. And
the  reports which came to him of crippled
spars told him that he could not, even could
he see his enemy, pursue him, until new spars
had been sent up, others secured, and new rig-
giugg rove,.
The crew could hardly realize, in the utter
silence which succeeded the thunder of broad-
sides, and the yells of fierce combatants, that
their enemy had crept off; and it was long be-
fore they would believe it-long before they
eyesed to look for the flash of his guns, or to
listen for sounds betokening that he Was in
the vicinity. It seemed impossible that he
could have gone off so still.

The loss of the Alligator in amen was not
near so great in the action as would have been
supposed, when she had been almost yard-arm
and yard-arm in action for a half hour or
more - but the very means taken to cripple
her spars, saved her men?
CHAPTER XXX.
The Alligator once more lay at an anchor
in the bay from whence she sailed before her
combat with Coleefrinas, as described last. It
had been necessary for her to run in to repair
damages, but her consorts were actively croi-
ing outside, and she soon expected to join them,
and Allen yet hoped to test the prowess of the
pirate chief in another combat.
Allen was below with O'Shaughnessy look-
ing over his daily report of the wounded and
sick, and hearing his verbal statement of their
condition, when a messenger front the officer
of the deck announced that a boat had shown
itself some way in land; with a white flag
fying.
"hoist a white flag, sir, at our fore to en-
courage the boat to conic on board, and if it
comes, assure its crew that their flag shall be
re1sected!r" said the young commander. "I
will be on deck in a moment !"
"Whew! I wonder what'll be done next by
the murthern' spalpeens !" said O'Shaugh-
nessy. "They're like that sort o' Christians
that sare the Lord of a Sunday, and onlid
Nick the rest o' the week 1"
"how do you make that out, doctor?"
asked Allen, with a smile.
" Why sure, cap's dear, haven't they been
a wearin' the black flag all the while, and now
raise the white one for convaynience. 1 hope
they're wanting a doctor to cure their big thafe
o' a leader !"
"Would you volunteer, doctor?"
"Only let 'em try me once, sir !" said the
doctor with a look that indicated a desire to do
something desperate-but as it was directed
toward the brandy-decanter oitmthe side-board,
A llen invited him to take something to drink)
wie' he did without any apparent reluctance.
When Allen reached the deck, the boat with
the white xlag had already been-alongside, and
leaving a young man on the deck, had instantly
shoved off, and pulled away.
"What does this mean, and why did not the
boat remain ?" asked Allen of the officer of the
deck.
"I know not, sir, perhaps this young man
can explain-but I see that he is blindfolded,
perhaps he is a released captive l"
"Few of their captives are released but by
the hand of Death .' said Allen, as the sup-
posed young man, finding himself free, tore off
the bandage from before his eyes with his own
hands.
A low cry of surprise broke from the lips of
the stranger, and Allen who had little expected
such a meeting, or such pleasure, cried, inms-
tonishment:

" Ieavens !You, senorita-you here, and
irm fromtl the por of Colceefinias ?"
r.im-uita ie Rerla-it could be none other
-ave him one look, then as if struck down
1-v tie suddenness of her joy, fell senseless to
tie deeek.
Allen, heedless of all but her, caught her up
in lir  ii arms, and bore her into'the cabin,
ealling to Doctor O'Shaughnessy to follow him.
")o all von can to restore her, sir-do it
quickly !" he said, as he laid hist fair burden
down upon the cushioned transom seat.
"is it a ier, cap'n, and in boy's clothes,
too ? Slie's miighty purty for a pirate !"
"Silence, sir, I wish no observations, but the
muse of your skill, sir !"
' Tien, eap'n, if you plaze, either take off
heu jacket, or else rip up the slave of it-it's
bladm n' cr I'd be after doin' !' said the doe.
tor, rattier testily, for he did nat fancy either
thme eammtin's words or tone to him.
' She must not be bled-where is your sal
voh itile---here, steward, bring me some wine
dud water I Bear a hand with them !"
hlie doctor was about again to urge the ine-
cessity of his favorite practice-bleeding, when
the p) girl opened her eyes, and began to
recover without aid. Allen placed sone wine
and water to her lips, and as the flush of re-
turiiiig strength came out upon her cheek, he
turned to the doctor and said
 I cm dispense with your services now, doe-
tor! If I spoke too harshly, exese me-I was
,exti'umely alarmed for the safety of the lady !"
Ahm, eap'n dean, a rough word from  you
would never fray the silken cord o' f h-indship
tat hinds me to you. Deuce the bit. If the
young lady, sir, should feel nervous, if you'll
take my poor advice, a drop of smooth ouild
barily would set her all right. I've some tip-
top f mat I got from onld'Mother Mallony i

hiomelf out of the cabin.
"Teil me h-ow you escaped, dear lady, and
hy what strange good fort mie I have the hap-
liiiess to recieve you here !" asked Allen, the
moment that lie was left alone with the lady.
a Seior, I scarcely kno w. I was his cap-
tive--anm free ;but why I became free, I ant iot
fully certain, But I believe the jealousy of a

cause.  Whatever it was, I bless Ieaven that
1 am  free and safe, for beneath your flag I
know I will be protected!"

" He thought so, and by treachery I nearly
lbecane so ; but he has learned his error,
and i' has cost him deiry !" replied Allen-in
generous kindness withholding the nature of
the treachery by which he had so nearly fallen
into the power of Colcefrinas. " But from
whence came you to-day ?"
From his main rendezvous, Ishouldjudge ;
for from the .atticed blinds of a house where 1
was kept some hours, I saw many vessels and
men. During the night before I had been re-
moved from a cave where he has collected im-
niense treasures, and where he had me confined
after I was taken with poor Captain Howard !''
"Where is lie ?
I know not. I have not seen him since the
hour of my capture. I have not been carried
anywhere without having my eyes bandaged !"
"The place of rendezvous cannot b far from
here !" said Allen, thoughtfully. " Have you
an idea of the length of time they were engaged
in bringing you here ?"
Not inure than three or four hours, cer-
tainly !"
"''hen I will have this coast scoured o
closely that it whereabouts cannot fail to !3e
learned. That done, and the infamous wretches
shall be exterminated ! But dear lady, how to
make you comfortable will be my first thought.
Should you desire to be sent to Matanzas-"
1 I have no such desire, sir ! I fled from my
father's house to escape his tyranny, and a
forced union with a man whose crimes he
knows, and the profits of which I fear he
shares. But I know you are too noble and
generous to use this belief of mine against
him !"
I would not harm him for the world, lady
-if I wished, I have grave cause to do it. But
for your sake I ignore that all ; and if you will
give mc the bliss of becoming lawfully your
protector, the moment that duty will permit, I
will sail for a port where we can be united !"
" The heart which has so long been yours,
trusts to you entirely !" said the lady, frankly
-for hers was not the nature, nor was she of a
nation that is icy, or backward in expressing
the strength of its passions.
CHAPTER XXXI.
"Madre de Dios !   What, what does thi
mean? Your vessel, with the evidences of re-
cent combat in her pierced hull and sails,
brought to an anchor in our port. in broad
day-light ; and you, armed to the teeth, stalk
through the town and into the palace, as if you
were lord of both I"
These words, half in anger, and half in ter-
ror, were spoken by Don Garcia do Regla, to
the pirate chief, soon after his escape from
Allen. And it. was no wonder that the audacity
and fear ess boldness of the pirate astonished
as well as frightened Dc Regla. The fact that
his was not a national vessel, though on this
occasion she wore Spanish colors, must cone
out; and Dc Regla knew not how to act,

" I did not come here to answer questions,
Garcia dc Regla, but to ask them!" said Colce-.
frinas, stern's. "Why, did you give that infer-
nal Yankee good powder?'
"I did nqt ! lie was supplied with the
damaged !"
'"Garcia de Ieg'a, you need not lie to me
"Lie?   Do you dare to use such language
to me?"
"Ay, worse than words! I have lost more
than half my men by your treachery! I ran
my vessel right under his broadside, and
taunted him to fire, when my crew was already
weakened by disaster, intending to cut him up
at leisure, believing the word that you sent
was true, and that his powder was worthless !"
"The powder which I- furnished him was
" The loss of more than half my men prove
that!" said the pirate, bitterly.
"Ne may have got powder elsewhere !" said
d?)e Regln, who, for many reasons, wished not
to excite the pirate more.
"Impossible! lie has been in no port but
this. It is your treachery. Garcia do Regla,
E see through it all! You have tired of me
and our compact, and thought to be rid of me.
But mark you, Colcefrinas, the master of fif-
teen hundred daring men, and more than fifty
millions of dollars, is not to be destroyed in a
moment. You are in my power-body and
soul-you are in my power, sir! your child is
in my hands, and if I take ten thoughts upon
the subject, I will probably feel more than half
inclined to take you and hang you before her
facen "
"You are going too far, sir !" said the mar-
uis; for Vastillian pride, as well as some na-
tive courage, began to come back to his aid.
"Were I but to breathe your name, or the
oharacter of your vessel here-"
"Well, what then ?" asked the pirate, with
3 sneer.
The marquis did not know what to say.
"I would tell the people and the soldiers
that their Intendente was my compaiero-that
he was an old hand at the trade, and that if they
didn't want their town burned up, they would
beware how they angered Colcefrinas ! And
the--they would tremble as you do now,
Garcia do ReglaI!"
"1 do not tremble, or if I do, it is with an-
ger, not with fear!" said the old Spaniard.
"A child's anger is not dangerous. But call
insome wine, De Regla-I am thirsty ! I came
hero hot, and you've said nothing to cool me
yet!"
"When will you leave this port ?" asked the
marquis, not heeding the demand of the
other.
"When it so pleases me-not before. I
called for wine. Will you order it, or shall I
ringfor a servant ?"
"I will order refreshments ; I would do that
sf the devil asked them. But suppose the
Mericaa fleet were to come in he-'e now ?"

"I would run my vessel under the guns of
your fort, and make you protect me."
"1Â«jake me ?"
"Yes; or else drag you on board, and blow
you, and myself, and all that's dear to you, up
together."
"Is my daughter on board of your vessel :'
"Igo ; she is where she is treated like a
queen, and will be, so long as she and her fa-
thier behave properly. But I have not done
with you in regard to that powder."
"On my honor, I swear !--"
" Tush !  Swear by something tangible--
sa'mething that exists."
"I tell you, by my honor as a Castilian-..
by every tie that is binding on earth or in
heaven, that I gave him the poor powder !"
"Then he has made it good by some Yan-
kee trick ; for 1 had all that I could do to es-
cape him. had he been favored with an hour
more of daylight, it would have been my last
cruise !"
hind the mar '% expressed the wish that
was in his heart, it would have been, that Al-
len had been favored with suflicient light to
have put Colcefrinas out of his way forever,
But lie did not ; and ordered wine and bran-
dy from a servant who answered the bell he
had rung.
" You would like to know why I came a:
here ?" said Colcefrinas, after he had tossed
off a bumper of brtndy-iguorings the wine
in its more potent presence.
" I would."
"I had to, to repair damage. 'lheYan..-
kees, though they do not know it, are block-
ading my main port-where, just now, all of
my force is assembled. I must refit some-
where ; and here was my best chance. I shalh
pass as a Spanish privateer, which has been
in action with a Mexican main-of--war - and.
with your aig the matter can be carried out
fery easily."
"And you expect me to aid you in this do-
ception?"
"I do not only expect it, but I deniand it
and you dare not refuel me !"
-" I dare!h-if it costs my life, I dare !" said
De Regis, taunted into desperation.
"The future Governor-General of Cuba-
perhaps Prime-Minister of Spain - iorgets
himself !" said the pirate, sarcastically ;.e" and
perhaps he also forgets certain bonds for
government moneys squandered, which are
held as a safe-guard by one who never trusted
him beyond the length of a cLain-eable !"
The marquis groaned; Ih i sew he was in
the power of that bold, bad  an, and lie did
not indeed dare to thwart his will.
" If I consent, you will hasten you depart.
ure, will you not ?" he asked, at last.
"Of course I will, if you are reasonable. I
have no desire to tarry long in port-I have
too much work ahead, But I shall depend
on you to answer the demands of my officers ;
for. I must run down by the overland route,

a'd see my me, .If you have a message to
your daughter, I will bear it."
" I wo ki rather you would bring her here !"
said the marquis, sadly. "lre she will be
safe-and you know not how dear to meo she
is. I- did" not know, until her absence told
inc !"
"She shall come here only after she is my
bride !" replied the pirate.  When these
Yankees have been driven o'ff, and she isnmine,
you shall see her decked and jewel td as a
queen !"

The sound of footsteps interrupted this wild
soliloquy ; and Mariana, who uttered it, turn-
ed toward the door of her glittering prison---
well knowingr, by the hasty, heavy tread, who
was approaching. A moinent iore, and he
entered, urted as lie Lad been when he last
stood in the pr sence of Garcia de tegla, but
now coy, red with the dusty stains of hasty
travel.;
" Well, lady, I have brought you a message
froni your father," said Coleefrinas. not recog.
nizii the change of persons as he entered the
lighted room. " I hope you will be thankful
for it, and not attempt to carry your head
quite so high as you did whes last I niet
you !''?
" I have dreamed that my father slept in a
bloody grave !" said Mauiano, in the tone
wlic'l he had heard froni Mariano's lips a
thuso l times-a tone snot quite so rich, but
a thousiul I tiles more deep iand thiri-nibg than
that of o rdiniry women.
'lhe pirate sprung forward and caught her
by the arm, looked at her fiercely for a mo-
metnt, and then cried:
" how dare you, sir, to masquerade w:th
me! I have allowed you too much liberty
hitherto !  It shall he lessened materially.
Where is the lady ?"
I am the only lady here," was the reply,
given in so low and street a tone, with down-
cast eyes and a blush so natural, that Colce-
frinas felt for an instant inclined to believe
that a woman indeed stood before him ; but
this he could not, for Mariano had from child-
hooh served him, and lie had never doubted
that he was a boy.
A woman, with all of a woman's heart e.-
cept her fears !" continued Mariano. And
she drew her proud foi-m up, and looked so

much like what heri mother had been when
first she attracted his passion, that he re lead
her arm and drew back.
"You act well. But have done with this
mummery ; I am not in a humor to be trifled
with now, sir !" said the pirate. , "Where is
the lady Maraquita, whom I left here ?"
"That is more than I can tell: she is not
here. When I came she went away."
"Villain I have you aided her to escape ?"
cried the chief, trembling with anger.    -
"I exchanged garments with her, and she
is free."
"Curse you-you shall die for this I" shout-
ed Coleefrinas, as he drew a pistol from his
belt.
Fire !" cried the excited girl, as she bold-
ly tore open the silken robes, and revealed a
spotless bosom, which all too well proclainied
her sex. "Fire! and pierce a heart which
for years, in silence an I sorrow, has throbbed
only for you--dark, dark and sinful though it
has been ! Why do you not fire ?"
The hand of Colcefrinas fell powerless t.
his side.
" What does this mean ?" hle 'asked, trem
bling. " Is it a miracle ? You are not the
Mariano who for years have been near me-
the Mariano whom I fou--d but a mere child
wit its mother ?"
I am that thild ! For reasons of her own
which she may explain, butt eannnot, my
mother has ever made me conceal nv sex un
til now; and now, that it is revealed, -hsn
Mariano ot longer, but MAinuaN-and stihl
your slave !"
And tearfully, timidly, she knelt, and tools
his hand and kissed it.
"So your mother is at the bottom of all
this !" he said, thoughtfully. ' Andthen ho
turned upon his heel and left the room ; while
she s ill remained kneeling.
She rose a moment after, and rushed to the
door to follow hit: it was barred, and she
yet- remained a prisoner.   With a low cry
of anguish, idhe t :ned back ; and, easting
herself down uponi the carpet-covered ground
sobbed and wept as if her Ih at would break
She was indeed a woman now.

I almost hoped !"
"Hoped, -Monona-hoped I was lost ?"
"Yes, Eduardo-yes, better the loss of your
life and mnmine, than to be awakened thus rudely
from the dream of love which has made me so
happy."
And Monona's voice began to tremble and
her eyes to moisten. Coleefrinasrsaw that the
woman-nature wVas struggling to comie back,
and with wily art he threw out a decoy to bring
it further.
"You have not lost soy love, Monona !" said
he.
" Why, then, did you seek to wed this I)e
Regla's child ?"
I did not mean to wed her. I held her as
a hostage for her father's faith, for I had rea-
son to doubt that ; and if we have no hold on
the government officials, our homes here would
soon be too hot to hold us. Besides, there
would be no market for our plunder, were iot
they our friends."
" You need not try to deceive me, Eduardo.
I have known your movements too long."
"You do well to talk of deceit, madam, who
have deceived me so long, and kept your daughc-
ter as a spy ulpon ily motions."
If you termn that deceit by which I have
concealed her sex, I um willing to bear the
blame of it. So far I have preserved her from
the wrong which has wrapped me in shame ;
and I hope I have given her a courage to pre-
fer death to dishonor."
A new thought-a new means to subdue the
tigress temper before him, suddenly flashed, as
all things had come, upon-his mind.
"Do not think that I regret to have discov.
cred your secret, or rather'to have learned the
sex of your ehild. She is very pretty-very
like what youonce were," said he, and a quiet
smile stole over his cold face.
Not new the jealous fears of a woman, but
all of a mother's nature was aroused, and Mo-
nona, pale as marble, threw herself at his feet.
" Oh ! for the love of lIeaveh ! do not hint
tiht she--s/cc, my child, will suffer wrong at
your hands-! I know that no priestly lips
have ever pronounced the nuptial benediction
for us-but oh! have we not been as man and
wife in the sight of Heaven for long, long years?
Eduardo-Eduardo! speak ! You do not con-
template this dreadful wrong ?"
"Where isMaraquita do Regla ?" he softly
asked, for he felt that Monona now would not
refuse an answer.
" She has gone on board of the American
schooner, at anchor off the coast," sobbed the
woman,

"Ten thousand curses on you! Have yout
given her up to him-to my deadliest foe?
hall he conquer me in everything? Off, wo-
man ! cling not to me now-off!"
And he cast her from him with a force that
left her stunned and senseless on the floor.
i did not pause to look at her, but sternly
strode from the house. Meeting his principal
officer, he asked:
" What was the plan of the expedition which
you were about to undertake when I returned,
Solano ?"
"A night attack upon the Yankees in Tor-
tuga Bay, my chief. There are but three ves-
sels; and if we took them unawares, we could
kill every man or run them overboard !"
"That is so. I have left the schooner in a
friendly port to refit, and I would have liked
to have had her crew in the fray. But it mat-
ters not ; we have men enough, and the attack
must be made in boats. Muster our forces at
once, and tell them that we will take those
Yankees this night, for I will lead the expedi-
tion!"
Ay, ny, sir ! It will be the best iews
they've heard in a year.  low soon will we
start, sir ?'
" It will be dark within an hour-let all
things be lpreparel within two. That will give
us time to board them when they sleep the
soundest in the nu(l-wateh ! Let the oars be
muffled, and none but able men allowed to take
an o'ir. This time we fight for safety and for
revenge, not for profit."
The officer hurried away to obey the orders
of his chief, and the latter returned into his
house, for he had.met the oilieer beneath the
window, and but a step fromi the door.
As he passed through the room where he
had left poor Monoiia, 'he looked u)on the
floor, but she was not there. She had recov-
ered sufficiently to go from there. Ile went
into the room where he usually sat, and where
a sideboard was placed,ponm which stood de-
canters of wine, brandy, etc. Of the last
he took a brimming goblet, iiiuttering as he
drank : "I will have her yet! Ilis life or
mine this time."
Where is your mistress, Lisa ?" he asked
of servant, who entered.
"She hasjust gone into her chamber, leior 1"
replied the negress.
" It is well! That is the best place for her,"
muttered the fierce man. And he woninto his
armory to prepare himself better fr lie even-
ing's work.
CHAPTER XXXV.
By good fortune Allen had several trunks of
clothing on board, which had been taken from
a vessel partially robbed, and deserted by
pirates ; and in a short time, by the aid of these,
the lady Maraquita was enabled to robe herself
in a manner becoming her sex. le was then

TIE PIRATE-HUNTERS OF THE GULF.

less delicate about introducing her to his offi-
cers than he would have been had she been
forced to appear in her male attire. And lie
wished to introduce her ; for lie deemed it ne-
cessary to call a council of the chief officers of
the little squadron together, and to give them
information of the evident vicinity of a large
rendezvous of the pirates, as was proven by her
recent adventure.
The council was held ; and it was there de-
termined on the morrow to start a large boat-
expedition, which was narrowly to search
every portion of the adjacent coast, and to
penetrate any inlets, bays, or rivers which they
inlght find. As it was evident, too, that there
was danger of a surprise when a large body of
inc were so near, additional look-outs were
ordered, and it was agreed to hoist the board-
ing nettings alter dark, and adopt other usual
nrecautions. As the vessels lay anchored
almost load and stern in a line in the narrow
bay, their defence if attacked would be united,
while it would extend the attacking force. The
precautions were taken not because the Amer-
icans believed the pirates would really have
the audacity to attack an armed force, hut be-
cause it was their duty to provide against its
possibility rather than its probability.
The night was dark ; had it been moonlight,
Allen would have doubtless asked the lady of
his love to promenade the deck, now deserted
by all but the ofheer of the watch and the
usual andh r-guard---for in no climate in the
world are moonlight promenades more de-
licious than in that flowery land. As it was,
though, the hours flew on uncounted until af-
ter the mniight watch had been changed,
Allen and Maeaquita remained in the after-
cabin of the schooner, conversing, for neither
felt like parting, even for sluiber.
Suddenly the hail of a sentinel was heard,
shouting, boat ahoy !"
An answer was given in Spanish, and Allen
hurried to the decl;, for he felt almost intuit-
ively that it must be something serious to
bring a boat on board at that time of night.
On a second hail, asking where the boat was
from, and what she waited, at the same time
warning her not to approach without pernis-
sioni was granted, a female voice replied
erie to save you from surprise and
destruction! For your own sakes let me see
your cominimander, instantly
Allen gave t ie order, and in a few moments
the boat was alongside, and lie assisted a fe-
male over the side, whose form was concealed
as well as sheltered from the night air by a
large cloak.
Which is your carptaim? let inc see him
alone, instantly!" she said.
" Come into t he cabin, madam !" said the
young officer. Then bidding the officer of the
deck detain the boat in which she came until
further orders, he preceded her into that apart-
ment.

" Whom have I the honor of addressing, and
what may the news be you have to impart ?"
asked Allen, as he motioned the stranger to a
seat.
"That lady knows I am- I was - the
slave of Colcefrinas, until his treachery and
brutal treatment forced me to desperation and
revenge. At the risk of my life I have come from
his rendezvous with a faithful boat's crew, who
are sworn to my service. He will attack your
vessels within an hour, with at least one thou-
sand men, hoping to take you utterly by sur-
prise. If you repulse him you shall see me
again-if you slay him, and will let me have
enough to make me and my child independ-
ent in some far off land where we are unknown,
and guarantee us protection until we are free
from  this region, I will disclose the hiding-
place of his treasures. Now let me go, for I
must return and avoid his boats, or C am lost !"
" Can I trust in what this lady says '" asked
Allen of Maraquita.         -
I think you can. Her hand gave me my
freedom!" said the seinorita.
"Lady, would you not be safer to remain
here ?" lie asked of Monona. " 'ilus forewarn-
ed, we can easily repulse those who attack us.
and afterward I can better serve you, prhnapsm!"
I prefer to return, sedor-ny c li Id may
be in danger ; fom she is yet a prisoner, in place
of this lady !"
" It shall be as you wish. And you have my
thanks for this wrning!"
" I need no thanks, sciior! I avenge myself
in warning you. But, beware, be is even now
near!"
She waited no longer, but was gone in a mo-
ment. Allen saw her over the side, and then
hastened to send word to his colleagues to pre.
pare for the impending attack, and lhinmselfsu-
peinitended the acessary operations.  The
broadsides of the vessels were sprung so as to
completely cover the entrane of the hay-
the guns were depressed so as 10o sweep the
surface of the watter within pistol-shot-they
were loaded to the nmzzle with grape-shot and
bags of musket-balls-all of the sill-arms
were changed, and the crews of the guns sta-
tioned. All the lights, except those usually
shown by vessels at anchor, were put out, and
the strictest silence enjoined, so that those who
intended to surprise miight believe in their sue-
cess until it was time to turn the tables on
them.
The men and ofileers had ben at their
stations an hour at least-it seemed lon-er, for
suspense hangs weights to the wings of Time---
and as yet no sound of the expected enemy
was heard.
"I shouldn't wonder if that woman had de-
cieved us, and had only conie as a spy to see
whether we were prepared or not !" said his
first lieutenant to Allen, as the Ia ter leaned
against the quarter-rail in a listening attitude.
" hush--I hear the low dip of oars 1- Be

ready to throw up the blue lights the moment
I give the worJ!" was Allen's low reply.     1
f To other ears t an those of one who watched
anxiously w.th tie hope of Paine in his heart,
thesoui is would have been inaudible, but
soon they beeaue so dist inet that at almost
the same mitoiment the. look-outs of the threeI
vessels hailed.
At that instant, a shower of rockets and blue
lights thrown up from Allen's vessel lighted
the little bay up with the glare of day, showing
its entrance illiel with  boats which were
stealthily pll)ing toward the me:.els-- boats
crowded with m'rmmed ien.
Ihitherto teIy hail heen silent as death, but
now, seeing thaiely were discovered, owth wild
yells and m naddening hiouts they dashed toward
the vessels.
The guns scarce needed sighting ;and in a
minute, w ith one terrific s hee of fire-one
earth-aid-acan-shakiing  sonI, the united
broadsides sen  the r freight of ironand lead
among the miserable wriethes. While yet the
wild echoes rolled from isle to isle, the erash
of splintere 1Iboats, the shriekis of dyiing men,
and the hubbling gronis of drowning ones rent
the air. ThaieInhvoci nis terriile, vet it did not
utterly cheek tlie onslaught of those terrible
men. More oats were n'rowrding into the bay,
and these, with  hise wi haiebt had aeseaped the
first dre rlfu I tire, still dhashen'd on with a brav-
ery worthy rrf a  ete curse.
But to oal and tire, ith great guns and
small, fromt Ihei''r yetihoo lb s hecks was an
easy affhirt to ti Aie riemans, in t they poured
in a fire so deadly, a binut a few hoats cane
near enogh to atlemit to hboar'd.

with the loss of at list Inn n-twtmhi'rs of his Band,
when he ias wounded badly in three different
Places, ie sn Iinly gave the orler to retire.

"It's strs g ' aintr they should want t be

bladin' to death, when they're sure to be hung
if they live !" mrutered th iidoctor, while lie

crews of the vessels were kept busy until day-
light im picking up wounded men, while the
rest still loept eareful guard on board, lest with
reinforcements the pirates might be so desper-
ate as to attempt no reicw the attack. But
they did not--their loss had been too g:'eat for
that.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
When Colcfrinas was borne into his cham-
esr, at the rendezvous, by sonime of his now-
disheartened men, Monona, with mock-sym-
pathy upon her lips and in her face, was the
tirst to tender henrassistancec-fo'r she had re-
turned undiscovered, and none but thsse who
were imh the secret knew. Crowning more' with
bitterness of hioart than with the ain of his
wounds, Coleef'rins hsade lier  ave him, rudely
refusing her assistance. And ms soon as hs
surgeon had attendeid to his wounds, hlie or-
dered a council of his chief others to a-em-
ble.
" There has been treason at work somewhere
among ourselves '' said th. " If the r nkHes

takti, they could t1 hvhm V ina so cornletr'lv

guns loaded el    sly for an amunthek, an their
lights anda rockets ready to throw ttn'i glare
upon us ! It is evident that there must be
son one among us who is alise!"
The others assented to this-limit to discover
the traitor or traitors was th thing to be ne-
complished.
" Who among you will desert me ?" asked
the wounded pirate.
" Not one-we will die with you, but never
desert you!" wa the unanimon's reply.
The chief smiled a ghastly smile,, for he was
suffering all the while.
"I had expected   hais devotion!" lie said.
3ut you do not understand mie. I want a
volunteer who will lesert---under a flag of
truce deliver hninmself into the hands of the
Yankees, and under the pledge of iarlon and
protection, agree to not is a pilot for them.
He can gain their confidenimce by leading them
to some of our long-shore baoat-stations, from
which our men, forewarned, many escape to the
hills, and he can discover who the traitor is that
has been so nearly our ruin, and who will be our
destruction. without he is diseovere d and pmi-

No aisle responded ! t was dangerous ; for,

ehery there would  isure to meet tie rope!

but none of thmns liked the idna of wearing a

their victims, would have its use abolished !
A little rape among them would benefit the
world in general, I believe.
"I will not send any one, for the duty is as
unpleasant as it is full of risk!" said Colce-
frinas.
And then his face brightened, as a new idea
seemed to strike him. He dismissed all of his
*      officers, except two in whom he confided more
than all the rest. To one he said : "You will
see that the lady Monona is, during the rest of
the day and night, confined strictly to her
chamber. Let her have communication with
no one outside. To-morrow, I care not where
she goes !"
To the other he confided a inc sage in a
whisper, only adding, at the close, in a louder
tone, "If she consents, bring her here quickly
-if not, let her renuin until I will is other--
wise!"                                 '
Trie officer bowed and hurried away, while
his comrade went for a guard to carry out the
other order of his chief.
This plan will work, I think, muttered the
chief, and exliasted with his exertions, he
sunk back upon his couch to rest.
CIIAPTERt XXXVII.
Mariana, left hopeless by the sudden depart-
ure of Colcefrinas, pined even more rapidly
than did poor Maraquila, when she had no
hope of relief before her, and feared a fate
more dreadful than death. Ier heart had not
been schooled to reverses, and her nature
taught to bend and vield, rather than to resist!
and break. Alt ! this is a hard world to learn,
aid one is apt to die just when lie lis got
fairly schooled in its bitter lessons.
Mtariana ssat moody ad listless in the splen-
dor of her prison, 'when again the sound of
footsteps feIl upon her ear, and she heard the
door untbiarred.  But she did not raise her
owed head from the table whereon it rested,
foi she knew that they were not his footsteps
which she heard-that he was not the one wto
approached.
"1 bear a message from Ooleefrinas to Ma-
riana !" said the person who stood before her.
She knew the voice, and quickly raised her
great black eves, mind anxiously scanned his
face, as if she would read- there his tidins
before he spake them.

in life. I would lose each drop of blood in
my veins, drop by drop, im his service! I ask
no freedom  but to serve him. Go to hini,
good Solano, go to him, and tell him this !"
" My instructions ,ere, if I found you vil-
ing, to takeyou with me into his p'e5(nce!"
Oh joy ! I am ready this instant to go.
But shall I not go in the garments I used to
vear "' -
No, lady-if I judge ariglht, you will be
his page no longer!" sauid Sli oiieer. "And
the garment s you now wreat' h-come you too
umucht for any one to wish to see you in any
other !"-
Mariana made no objections. She was but
too glad to leave her trisot-oo glad to go to
hit for whont she felt a love as wild and deep
as it was strange and unnatural.
She stood by his side, blushing and trem-
bling like a child in the pr  ie of a god
lie, still faint and weak  omt t he loss of bl od,
wt-as ale pale, ut he never hld looked so noble
inlia 1-eyes, for he spoke very gently and
kinid '.
"These Yankees have been too much for
us, Mariana !'' said he. " And they will yet
destroy us all if we do not soon turn'the tales
(en them. Solano says Shat you are willing to
serve mite!.
" Witlh ty life, my'k lor'd-you have but to

only path of retreat. Can you do me this'
service, Mariana ?"
" I can and will, faithfully, if I lose my life
in carrying out your wishes. I have no desire
but to serve you, no wish but to live and die
near you !"
"We will never be long separated, Mariana!"
said the wily pirate. " If we but succeed in
driving these pests away, I intend to gather
together my treasure, and to go far, far front
here, I have seen enough of peril and of
bloodshed ! Your young days have been
dark ones, in future you shall see sunshine !"
The impassioned girl knelt by his bedside,
and covered his hands with glad tears and
kisses,
It seemed strange, even to Colcefrinas, that
during all this time she did not ask for her
mother. But she seemed to have but one
thought-one feeling-to know of, or to care
to know of, but one being on earth.
" When shall I go, my master ?" she asked,
as she arose to her feet.
"As soon as night mantles the sky, my love.
Take my own light skiff, which 1 will have
prepared for you. You will easily find the
Americans. They are at anchor in Tortuga
Bay, When you have learned all you can, and
found out who it is that has betrayed us,
hasten to my side. They will not watch you,
and escape will be easy. in the meantime, do
not speak to a soul here. Your mother is in
her apartment, and not verj well. But I do
not wish her to know that you are here !"
"If my master will permit, I will remain by
his side until it is time for me to start !"
You surely shall have your wish, my good
Mariana! I low strange that I should not have
discovered your sex before ! You are very,
very beautiful
So well was the entrance to the rendezvous
of the pirates concealed, that the boats of the
Amer can expedition rowed by within less
than two hundred yards of it, and did not
discover it, on the day after their successful
repulse of the pirates.  And though they
hunted up and down the coast for some
leagues to the eastward and westward of their
anchorage, they discovered nothing of note.
When Allen returned to his vessel at night,
he was weary and disappointed, for he had
felt confident that he would discover the main
nest of the gang, and completely break them
up. But he found a visitor who brought to
him news that was far from unimportant  it
was none other than the American Consul
front Matanzas, in person, who came to de-
scribe the suspicious-looking schooner which
was refitting in that port as a Spanish priva-
teer, and which he believed to be a pirate.'
From the consul's description, Allen had no
doubt but that she was his late antagonist,
and his first thought was to sail at mace and
capture her. But he knew that Coleefrinas'
was not in her, f r he had recognized him in

1
F

the night attack, and hoped that he was slain
for twice, with an almost unerring rile, he had
fired at hint, as he believed, with good aim.
The consul had also learned that near a week
would pass before the schooner would be
ready for sea, and Allen, therefore, determined
to spend a day or two more in his search for
the pirates, for he knew that they must be
somewhere near. While he was conversing
with the consul and Maraquita, a messenger
from the officer of the deck announced that a
boat with a single person, and that a woman,
had come alongside, not having been seen un-
til she was within a few feet of the gangway.
"If so poor a watch is kept as that, we are
never safe from surprise.!" said Allen, angrily.
"have the woman brought into the cabin,
and double the watch. It is doubtless the
same who forewarned us of the night attack.
She promised to return."
Wien the messenger returned, bringing
Mariana instead of her mother, Allen was
greatly surprised, and Maraquita uttering a
cry of joy, hastened to embrace her, for she
felt that to her, principally, she owed her free-
dom. flurried inquiries were made, and re-
plies given, between the two females, by which
Allen learned that Mariana, fearing that Col-
eefrinas would slay her, had escaped, and fled
to his vessel for protection. She had not seen
her mother, but had heard of the night-attack,
and that Colcefrinas was badly wounded.
And to her utter astonishment, Mariana now
learned that her mother had been the one who
had warned the Americans of the intended at-
tack-to her agony we may add, for she had
sworn to Coleefrinas that she would find out
and reveal the traitor, whoever it might be.
She knew how wild and jealous was her mo-
ther's disposition, but she had not dreamed
that it would lead her to be false to those with
whom she had dwelt so many years, and to
bin whom she had so wildly loved.
It must be remembered- that Morkana,
reared from childhood amongst these des-
perate people, did not look upon piracy as a
crime, and regard it with an eye of horror,
but thought more of it as an honorable war-
fare, in which all that was taken was a prize to
the victor. Was not all the world against her
people, and were they not right to prey upon
the world ? She thought so, and knew no
better. Who could lame her?
After hearing all that Mariana had to say
about liver escape, and also of the damage which
the pirate had sustained in the night-attack,
Allen began gently to ask how the pirates
were situated.
Mariana now had her most difficult task to
perform. Womanlike she appeared to fear-to
attempt to pilot the Americans to the strong-
hold of the pirates, and sie also said they had
several. And she so greatly exaggerated
their numube:s, that Allen believing al she
said, felt that it would be folly with his force

to attack them in a body, but he hoped to
separate them and cut them off in detail, pre-
vent their marauding (xeirsioins, and finally
to harass them into leaving those waters for-
ever, or else utterly to destroy them. And he
forebore that evening to push his inquiries or
requests further, and left Maraquita and Mari-
ana to themselves, with the true delicacy of a
gentleman.
CHAPTER XXXIX.
"I am truly obliged to your serene highness
for permission once more to stand in your
presence," said Monona, no kingly, to Colce-
frinas, wh -, after finding the guard removed
from her door, she hal ventured from her
chamber to that in which lie lay.
" I did not anit to be annoyed by your
false sympathies, untilI found that my wounds
were not of a sertols nature, and my recovery
likely to be retarded by a woman who no
longer loves me !" said he.
"And whom you never loved, you might as
well have added."
"You can have it so if it pleases you, iiad-
am."
" I will. I am sorry that you are likely to
recover ; there will be one1 personal greatly dis-

" No, sir ; yet anot her !"
" May I ask who ?"
" Certainly :his Satanic Majesty, whose

" Your endeavors to be fueetious are very

" I)o they annoy you, sir ?"
"Not at all, nuolam: you may continue."
Not if it pleases you. IHlow can I annoy

" By cutting your own throat."
" That I shal not do until l y have seen Col-

I hate you now as bitterly as 1 once loved you
warmly. Were you not a woman, I would

Tie eyes of the fierce, hating woman fairly
blazed wi h anger.
" Eduardo Coeefrimas," she lii.ed, " you
may hate me- care not for that ; but, by
the hivimg God ! you shall find that I amt not

"That if you know when you are well off,

CIIAPTEIt XL.
It jeered strange ; but Allen bad eonsent-
cd to the r quest. strange as i wa. if Mari
ania tluaut if her mother caine otf from  the
shore, sce was to be kept concealed from her;

THE PIRATE-HUNTERS OF THE GULF.          61

nor was her mother to be informed of her es-
cape. The reason she gave for this was, that
her mother was of a variable and fickle nature,
and in her anger so careless, that she might
etray her whereabouts to Coleefrinas ; and
Mariana seemed to fear him as if le were sonic
demon possessed of more than mortal powi r.
And well for Mariana's plans was it that she
had made this request ; for, on the evening
following that of her arrival on board, her
mother came as before'- and this time for the
purpose of betraying the pirate-chieftain in
his stronghold. Shebrought to Allen a draw-
ing of the rendezvous bav, and a chart of the
entrance, drawn with her' own hand ; but she
did not disclose the hiding-place of the trea-
sure - determined, probably, to keep that
knowledge for hier own benefit, for the time,
at least.
Mariana, from na state-room close at hand,
heard all this ; and she could scarcely conceal
her feelings from Maraquita, who remained
with her. it may be imagined that, with her
own feelings for Coleefrinas, she had not loved
her mother very deeply before ; but now she
felt for her no feeling of affection, and only
wanted a chance to escape from the vessel,
and expose her in time to save her chief and
his band from the effects of her betrayal.
With almost tremulous eagerness, she heard
her mother agree to have a small beacon-light
.placed outside the entrance to the bay of ren-
dezvoy's on the next night, and thus to aid the
Americans in their descent upon the band. In
regard to the numbers of the enemy and their
condition, her statement and that of her mo-
ther did not agree ; but Allen did not think of
studying discrepancies. So entirely was he
bound up in the duty upon which he and his
have colleagues had been sent, that he did
not feel inclined to ask how many he was to
meet: his greatest desire was, to know wh e
they were.
lie got the consul to go back to watt the
movementss of De Itegla and the seh ner in
Matanzas-promising to follow or send a ves-
sel to capture her after he had attended to the
ease of the pirates at their head-quarters ; then
holding a council with the other officers, he
made them acquainted with the rare good
news he had received ; and the evening was
spent in joyous anticipation of a livelier night
to ensue.
Perhaps no men enjoy, proportionately with
the hardships which they must suffer, life as
to our naval otli:crc; none can better appre-
ciate a social hour than they. Guarded against
.issipation by a stern and severe discipline,
they can yet enjoy their friendly glass of wine,
r more fraternal glass of "grog," and a fra-
grat eigar ; and when in a  knot," can spin
thei- " varus" with a gusto that cannot well
te2' o rihed or appreeiated, except by one of
". :c = or one who has been of them-as
,   r.with hiti who pen theme lines.

And on this occasion - the honors of the
" mess" being dulv performed by Allen, some
excellent punch brewed, and other indispensa-
blee passed round--the olicers of the little
fleet enjoyed themselves until a late hour.
They had not un    f ear of another night at-
tack  the last had pirlably taken a desire for
at turnal comiibat4 out of the main body of
the pirate . It was late when Allen's guests
left hiim, and he retired at onee; for Monona
hid gone back to the shore long before, and
lhi. other guests had gone to their state-rooms
at an early hour.
CH1APTEIt XLI.
W Where is Mariana ?" asked Allen, on the
ensuing morning, of Maraquita, as the latter
came from her state-room, looking as fresh as
a magnolia tinged with the morning sunlight.
" We wait breakthst now for her.'
" I will see," replied the young lady, " if she
is dressed."
She asent to her state-room and knocked,
but received no response. She tried the door;
and, it being unfastened, she opened it and
looked in. Mariana was not there. Maraquita's
exclamation of surprise drew Allen instantly
to her side.
" Not here !" he exclaimed, in wonder
"Where can she be ?"
And instantly search was made in nil other
parts of the vessel where she could have gone ;
for he thought she might have risen early and
gone to pronmenade on deck. But she was not
to be found ; and on examination, it was dis-
covered that the small skiff iii which she
came, which had been fastened astern, was also
missing.
Maraquita now bethought her how~ agitated
Mariana had been when they both heard Monona
telling Allen about Colee'rinas and his posi-
tion, and told 'Allen of it.
"I see through the matter now !" said the
latter. "Mariana hams been sent here as a spy
--she has been to us with falsehood on her
lips and treachery in her heart !'" -
"I cannot believe it I" responded Maraqui-
ta. "She was the only one who was kind to
me when I was in his power : her mother,
even when she helped me to miy freedom, was
stern and harsh. There is some mystery in
this ; but I cannot believe that Mariana came
as a spy l"
" We will see. I. shall learn, before mid-
night, if my conjectures are right ; for if she
has been here ns a spy, and discovered her
mother's treachery to the band, Colcefrinas
will know it, and be on his guard."
"Even if it were so, she would not betray
her itother to his terrible anger !"
"It would not seem natural that she should
-but crime, or an association with criminals,
hardens every nature. There is no imagining
what she would or would not do. But this

must not spoil our appetites : to breakfast,
fair lady mine-to breakfast!"
Trhiey hal bit just taken seats at the table,
when a message from the officer of the deck
announced a boat coming into the bay, with
an English flag flying over hier stern-sheets.
The face of Allen Bushed with pleasure yi
he received the message.
"If any of the EniglhPli fleet are outside,"
said he, "~they will gladly cu-operate with us,
and our force will be so strengthened that no
position or defeice of the pirates will avail
them. If there is an oticer in the English
boat, let him be invited to breakfast with me,"
he added, to the messenger.
" There are two, sir," said the latter: "I saw
them before I caine below."
"Very well. Steward, place two' more
plates here, and let the cook do his duty.
l'hese Englishmen live by eating! They're
in a good humor only when their bread-baskets
are fill."
Maraquita smiled at this idea, for it seemed
singular thnt one's good-nature should depend
on his feeding.
But she had not time to make any remarks,
if any suggested themselves to her, for two of-
ficers were ushered into the cabin. Both wore
the crown-and-anchor button of the royal
navy ; but one was dressed in a black frock
coat, and wore the spotless cravat of white,
which told tint he was a chaplain in the serv-
ice. The first-a fine-looking man, of not
more than thiirty--introduced himself as Lord
Seymour, ca ptain of the frigate Medusa, and
introduced the other as Mr. Mordnunt, the chap-
lain of his ship.
Both gentlemen accepted the invitation to
breakfast without hesitation: a morning's row
from the frigate, which lay in the roads, five
or six miles off, had given them an appetite.
And Allen's appetite seemed to increase-for
a new and happy thought had entered his
mind the moment that he saw the clerical rig
of the chaplain. What it was, none but a di-
abolical old bachelor, or a wretched ancient
maiden, will have or take occasion to inquire.
And as his eyes met those of Maraquita, and
glanced thence toward the chaplain, a blush
on her lovely cheek told that she read the first
wish of his'heart-a blush of joy; for thought
she was modest and pure as a child, yet she
was too artless to conceal her warm heart's feel-
ings.
While they were at breakfast,Allen, without
hesitation, revealed his knowledge of the pi-
rates and their position, and his intention of
attacking them ; and asked the co-operation
of Lord Seymour and as many of his crew as
he could spire. The latter assented readily :
"'Twill be a jolly bit of fun, no doubt,"
said lie. "Parson, you'd as readily take a
hand in it as you would a game of wlhist,
wouldn't you ?" he added, addressing the chap-
lain.

ss, oR,
"More readily !" said Mr. Mordaunt. "Are
not those bloodthirsty creatures the enemies
alike of Cod and man. It is our solemn duty
to destroy them!"
" I was not aware before that the chaplains
of your navy ever encountered active service,"
said Allen, vith a smile at the earnest manner
of the chaph in's reply.
" If we tig itwith the men for a victory that
we have prayed for," answered the chaplain,
"they will be sure to believe in our sincer-
ity.'
"That is so!" replied Seymour, with a
smile. ' "You see, lieutenant, we have a model
chaplain, who believes in works as well as
words !"
"So I perceive, sir. IIe must be a valuable
auxiliary on board your vessel."
"HUe is, indeed. Why, he is quite a sailor,
withal. He can take an observation as well as
the master: work ship ; and to-night, if we
overhaul those bloody buccaneers, you will
s e how well he can handle a sword."
"Does lie understand knotting ndil splic-
ing ?" asked Allen. And he glanced at Mar.
aquita.
Though she did. not understand nautical
terms, the lady seemed to comprehend the
meaning of that question, for the red blood
again flushed her cheek and mantled her brow.
Seymour saw the look and blush, and in a
moment comprehended the drift of the quer-
ist.
"Yes, very well," he answered. "iIe has
hid several occasions to practice since  lie has
been on this station, andi I assure you is com-
pletely au fait at the business."
"If lie intends to join our expedition to-
night, I may ask a trial of his skill before we
go, for fear that lie may be incapacitated for
acting before we return," said Allen. "To be
brief md to the point, lMr. Mordaunt," he
continued, " this lady and myself are engaged
to be married ; and as there is no legal imped-
iment to our union, the emeiony might be
performed here, which should have been per-
formed in the first port I reached."
"Certainly ; and it will afford me sincere
pleasure to act upon the happy occasion, and
to tie a knot which no mortal can justly untie,"
said the chaplain.
Maraquita having excused herself and re-
tired to her room, Allen gave his visitors a
brief account of her recent romantic ativen.
tures, withholding for her sake the knowledge
that lie had of her father's complicity with
the pirates. In truth, he hind withheld it from
her so far as lie could, though she could not
but know something of it. lIe knew that she
was not to blame for any evil which her father
might have dlone, or might do ; and lie was not
one of that msite-souled, narrow-minded class
which think that tue ha. act of one person at
taints the blood of every one connected with
him by blood.

all the better because no motive or ecue

But such is the case. Look at the Chnusi,

nical rule in the civilized world. An i when
such a hero as Lopez rises to aid them in

this is not a part of my sto'-y-only a drop of

bounds lis squeezed oit of my nature.
Back to my pen-path. Byt he time that
night fell, every'available boat from the three
American vessels and from the British frigate,

the two nations floated side by side in the

was to be which would be foremost in punish-

and a stout leathern cap, by the side of Lord
Seymour, in his gig, nd everv officer was in

pride. For the shadow of gloom which, in
spite of his efforts, had fallen on his heart
more than once during the afternoon, had
renehed her heart, and she now clung to him
with a foreboding that they would meet no
more in life. He felt-alas! sadly felt-that
foreboding, but he hushed it down And would
not let it reach her ears.

ever felt any love for her, that feeling was
now utterly baminhed from hle heat, antd to
say the least, ilditference, ifnet dslike, had
taken its place.
But once had he seen her mi ii about noon
of the day succeedig her second eight visit
to the American ve sels.  Ilen she cane front
her chamber, looking, as cal and eontented
as if she had never beet paned or angered,
as if nothing whatever disturbed her.  He,
with all his knowledge of human character,
might have mistrusted that "calm," but be
did not seem to. lie ginned carelessly at her
as she passed in silence thiougi the room
where he sat, but made no remark.
When she bad gone out, h sai to Solano,
who was by his sde : " It is time that we saw
or heard something from Mariant I1do not
think it will take her long to discover what
we desire. She possesses the wit of a wo01 omn
with the courage of a man !"
Scarcely had these words passed his lips
when a hurried step was heard, alid the sub
ject of his thoughts and words made her ap-
pearanee. 11cr face was paleu and anxios--
her manner nervous, and full of agitation.
r    "You have news ?" cried Coleefrinas, hur-
I riedly.
"t have. It is not good. The rendezvous
e is known to the eny, and you will be at-
y  tacked to-night.",
"Who is the traitor that has betrayed us
e    "I cannot tell,'my master !" said Marinain;
and ahe turned deathly pale, and trembled
d  like a reed shaking in a gale.
wi "Do you know r" asked Coleefrinas, and
2, ia keen eyes seemed to read her very soul-

"I do, my master. I cannot lie to you-I
,do fo"
-  And will not tell ?"'
Oh, yI lilaster, spare mne-do not ask
me !" and sie dropped on her knees before
him, andI kissedI his hands, while hot tears
rained down ini showers from her great black
eyes.
I~ laan instant Coleefrinas divined all-; and
with a strong effort completely mastering his
r       passiols, an i seeing to be perfectly calm,
le said, in the mil st1)  gentle tone  " You need
not, myx' poor Mariaiia-you need not. Rise
and o to yourli ii room to take some rest.
ltt smre amoment-you say we ivill be at-
taeketl t -igh."
-Ve, imy aiister. At midnight a beacon
webill be shown at tie outer point of the wind-
. ag entrance to the bay-it is to guide your
destrovers he'r'."
It will guide them to death. We will now
show theml that we tlurned poiet.hing of them
the other night . Uut what meant the cannon-
iding we' harI to-day?"
I kniw not. It'was nearly (lawn when I
escaped from thevessel, and I had to row far
to windward, ailoiig the islands, to escape the
sight of their guard-boats, which are rowing
along the coast. I heard the guns fired asif
for a salute, and supposed that more vessel
hand joined themi !"
h " Likely. J)o vou think they know of the
stronghold ani treasure vaults in the moun-
tains '"
" No more Ilhan the Seti rita do Regla has
told them, and lishe knows not where they
aie!'"
"IS is well. let ire tinow, my good child, and
rest--by-aud-hy I will have von called I"
Mariana's tace flushed'with joy. ie spoke
to her so kindly. She again kissed his hand,
and then retired as he bade 1her'.
But the moment that she was gone, the
bland look upon the face of Colcefrinasphang-
and even Solano, who knew him so well,
was almost terrified at the terrible change
which his anger made in his face.
The tigress was right I" lie hissed. " She
Is mut to he despised! But she is to be pun-
ished! The traitiess shall dearly rue the heur
when first the thought of treachery to us en-
tered her heart !"
"To whom do you allude ?" asked Solano,
"To Monona. She it is who has betrayed
us! Siheit was who -rinformed the cursed
Yankees of our intended surprise, and who
caused the loss of half our best men, and gain-
ed for me these crippling wounds. I have
been blind not to guard against her, knowing
that a jealous woman will not stop at any-
thing. But she has had help, She could not
go alone, for she has not Mariana's skill with
the oar. We must quietly find out whom she
has in her confidence, who has rowed her
'about in the many little pleasure-exeursions

which she has recently undertaken. To yo,
Solano, I intrust this delicate work while I
confront her ; and then we must make haste to
prepare to receive our friends to-night. If
they do obtain a foothold here, we have yet a
place of retreat which they cannot force-if
they do, it will be the worse for them, for if
the worst cones to the worst, mlly own hand
shall send all to hell together. 'I know that
you never will desert me !"
"Never-never !" said Solano, as he grasped
the hand of the desperate chief.
" Then haste to do my bidding. But let no
agitation of yours announce our discoveries.
When you have found those mn out, secure
them where they cannot bh seen or spoken to
except by their guard, and bid the latter nei-
ther to ask nor answer any questions ! But
first tell that she-tigressthat'Iwant tosee her;
and if she refuses to come, have her arrested
and placed in the strong-room below. without
causing any excitement, if you can. If she
comes, send two of the trustiest men to await
my ordersr"
'Th'lie officer bowed, and'Colcefrinas, who, by
a great effort, had again become calm, was left
for the moment alone.
.CHIAPTER XLV.
"You wanted me-so said your messenger I
I am here."
Monona, when she entered the room and ut-
tered these words to Coleefriuas, looked as
quiet and innocent as if never a storm had
raged in her heart, or a bitter thought emanat-
ed from her mind.
The pirate chief looked at her intently for a
minute or two, without speaking.
" Sit down," said he, at last. " Your re-
cent exertions must have fatigued you !"
"Not at all. One scarcely feels fatigued
when they are in pursuit of pleasure"
"Then you have been in the pursuit of plea-
sure ?"
"Yes."
"And found it !"
"Not yet-but soon expect to do so 1"
"When-at midnight, to-night, when yoa
light the beacon on the outer point ?"
For a moment, the woman's forced compos-
ure gave way, and the color left her check, and
she trembled ; for she felt that lie had gained
some knowledge of her secret. But how, she
could not divine; for her boat's crew were
sworn by terrible oaths to be true to her, and
her only, and they did not know of the ar-
rangement to light the beacon. That had
been made with Allen alone. But her sterner
nature in a moment gave her strength to meet
his glance, and she replied:
"You speak in words which I do not under-
stand!"
"'You need not add falsehood to the crime
of treachery, madam. I know all of your ac-
tions and intentions, and when the Americana

" Very well, sir, 1 give you joy i  your
prospect. uit as you are lime, I would ad-
vise you to make due provision to assist you
in running away again !
You are thoughtful, madam. And for
fear that harm  may come to you before the
hour when you are to light the beacon, I will
have you place under guard.      '   t
And as he said this, he made a motion to
the men who had been sent by Sjlano, and
they at once advanced to seize her.
Back-back-lay a hand upon me and you
die !" she cried ; and in an intant she changed
from the clove into the tigress. Her dark eyes
fairly blazed, as she drew a pistol, from her ho-
son, and with her back to the wall, confronted
the enn, For an instant they hesitated.
"Coyvards ! She is but a woman ." said the
chief.
One of the men sprung forward to seize her.
The action was his last, for a ball crashed
through his brain crc le had taken two steps
forward. The other, with an oath, sprung to
seize her before she could draw another wea-
pon, but he was too slow. She drew another
pistol before he could reach her-fired-and
he sunk with a low groan to the floor.
"I would serve you as l have thm," she
said, bitterly, to Colcefrinas, "if I did not re-
serve to myself the hope to see you hanged."
"Murderess-you shall die for this I" cried
the excited chief. "Seize the she-devil
The last order was given to Solano, who,
with a guard of men, had hurried in, attracted
by the firing. And as they took her unawares,
the desperate woman was instantly secured.
"Remove her to tla e strong-roomd below-
she has slain your comrades, men, and betray-
ed us all! I will find a fitting punishment for
her," said the chief.
Scarcely had they left the room in obedi-
ence to the order, with their prisoner ,when
Mariana, who had been awakened from slum-
ber by the sound of the shots, hurried in.
a What is the matter, my master ?" she ask-
ed. "Are you in peril? "
"It is past, good Mariana, it is past," h
said, with a gentle smile. "Do not be dis-
turbed, but rest now; for in a little time I shall
call my officers to council, and then I shaht
need you."
The girl glanced at the bodies upon the
floor, and knew that the chief had been in peril
but she questioned no further. He was safe,
and the danger was past.
CHAPTER XLV
It was wi night; and at the head of the dens
column of boats containing the united forced
of English and Americans. Allen cautiousl3
approached that part of the coast where Mono
ualudpromised to light a beacon which would

lead them to the masked entrance to the bay
of rendezvous. Another boat close by the
side of hiis own, so near that low-voiced words
could be heard from one to the other, contain-
ed Lord Semour and his chaplain.
'ed  eight was not entirely obscure -the
moon was up, but drifting clouds moving over
the sky caused its light to fall only in patches
lure and there upon the earth.
"Is it not time that the beacon the woman
promised wis alight?" asked Seymour of Al.
i-n. "My watch says twelve.,,
Mine also," replied Allen  "And we are
iear the shore. Alh, there the light lashlme.
Sne is true to her word."
A bright blaze was seen suddenly to spring
il)foibunth a bold bluff a little mon the-it
p                 d        starboardhn  -andby its light thmre seeuimd
to be a group of persons stani g there. see-
1bmg a woman's dress, Allen exclaimed :-
"It is thi woman and her boats crew. We
are all right, and can go on safely'
Giving the order to his mea to row on, Al-
len steered directly to the point, and the other
boats followed. When within a few fathoms
of this shore, lie gave orem-un to thme other boats
to hi-s upon their oars, while he pulled to the
shore to confer with the woman, and learn
ho omattersstood ahead. lIe asked Seymour
to land wit him.
Allemswasma few paces in advance, ands had
alminst reached te group - which remained
silent and motionless--whichr, with ami exehmuma-
tiers of horror, lie stopped.
" o        rhat is thems atter ?" asked Seymour,
hurrying up.
hGod of nercy I Look there-we ourselves
are in peril, for the pirates are on their guardI"
exclaimed Allen.
Beth Seymour and his chaplain also paused
in horror for a moment, for now they saw why
tIe group had been silent and motionless.
Emch person-Monona and all of her boat's
crew--was dead, and fastened in an erect po-
sit )1 tmo stakes. Upon the breast of Monona
wasfutened a placard, with these words writ-
te-n l in it its letters of blmod
n Thms Colcefrin s punislies treason in his
own camp! Let    e Yankees advance. They
will find a earn welcome !"
Allen and Seymour for a moment were si-
l lent ; then the former said :
S    "W we ul advance - welcome or not wel-
come!t"
e     Isee no inlet here or hereabouts," said
ISeymour. "The lips which would have told
us how to steer are silent now."
"That is so; but from her previous descrip-
tic-n, I feel satisfied that the entrance is very
nathspot," said Allen. "We can but look
e for it; and if we do not find. it in tme dark, we
s need only wait until morning. In truth, now
y that they have prepared for us, it seems to mae
- that it were no more than prudent if we waited
d until we could see what was before"us.

chapin, Mr. Moilaunt, lpreedied thl heat,
which coitaied the body of poor Allen snme
distance, to endeavor to break the news of hbe'
gallant husband's untimely fall, as gentle as
possible, to pioor Maraquita.
To their utter surprise, they found that lady
aated im the eabin, calm and quiet, but with
the pallor of death on her cheek, which was
made more visible by the dress which she wore.
It was black. She had already donned the.
robes of mourning.
She smiled gently, but oh, how sadly ! iis
they cautme im, and in a low tone said, as she
motioned their to seats
. You are hind. .-You come to speak words
of consolation t o the widow ! You need not
shake your heads-----it is not mercy, for I know
alL- I saw hiim when he fell-i knew he never

The officers thought that her reason hid left
'her, for shincould not have known positively of
the fall of lie husband. But mysterious in-
iluenees somtimes bea' to us the knowledge
of great nsorrows. And so there had come 'to
lier soae ispiritl unaeen--but felt-perhaps hia
own-whvich whispered to her heart, that thence-
torth it must bat alone.
ISgher o calm, the chaplain thought
that he miht u'er a few words of consolation
consonant wi the duties of his holy rofe s-
" sion, amidul 'mintd to do' so. 'But she did

that heard it, and which brought tears to ev-
cry eye there. " This is our bridal night I" she
aid, after a pause. And then she shivered as
with cold, and rose and stood for a moment as if
listening.  -1I hear the glad cathedral bells ?"
she murmured. " Come love-come !" and
she reached out her hand as if to lead him with
her.  The next instant, though, she reeled
and fell, so stiff and cold that all thought her
dead. But Doctor O'Shaughnessy, who had
been wee ping like a child, sprung to her aid,
and found that she was only in a swoon-her
overstrained spirit had not strength to sustain
her body.
Restoratives were used, and she was borne
to her couch, while it was decided by the oil-
ceas now in conuuand to take the vessel at
once to Matanzas, where, if the lady desired,
she could be restored to her father. Amid the
intention of Allen to go there in- sni:c the
"i Plot " was nott forgotten.
'W hen thef;Almai1u          ~ , s  e-mme

late to capture the supposed pirate. S lwhad
either finished her repairs sooner tlmati was ins-
ticipated, or gone to sea with sonie of them
left undone ; for, much to the surprise and
chagrin of the cnsulsi-Iho supposed he was
keeping a close wateh upon her--she slipped
off and went to sea, or somewhere out of sight,
during the night previous to the arrival of the
pirate-hunting fleet.
The people of Maftanzas seemed to be really
glad to hear of the destruction of the pirates.
Perhaps they were.    And the Marquis de
Regh, it need not be doubted, was glad ; for
Coleefrinas had beome to him more than a
te 'ror: and the report of the Americans was,
like their belief, that Colcefrinas was slain-
had perished in the explosion.
Nor did the marquis mourn for the death of
Allen, because he bore no good-will to the.
Americans as a natition ; but he did grieve sin-
cerely at the condition in which his daughter
had come back to himm: for, as we have said
more thami once in this story, he loved her with
all the love that was in his nature. She had
beco-me-or, in fact, had been-from the hour
when her husband's bosdy was brought to her,
 harmlessly, hopelessly, pitifuly insane.
It swas amnost heut-reirding to hear her talk.
Faneying at one time that lie was by her side,
she woui address him in the fondest and most
endearing terms. 'Then again, seeming to think
him temporarily absent, she would plead in
tearful agony for him to come back to her.
Still again, serming to see him in the red me-
lee of a terrible fight, she would throw up her
armis, and shriek to heaven to'save him ; and
in that mood she would fall away into eon-
vls ins, which barely left her alive

She hid to be watched constantly, lest she
should destroy herself. And most hard of all,
to her father, she did not recognize him. Nor'
did she seem  to remember any of her old
friends, when they came to see her. Two per--
sons only could get rational replies from her
- these two were the only ones whom she
would call by name : one was Lord Seymour,
who had become very deeply interested in
her ; the other was his chaplain, Mr. Mordaunt.
Seeming to recognize them as her husband s
last friends on earth, she appeared to be fond
of their society, and was ever child-like cr1d
gentle when they were with her. But dilly
would not permit of their lengthened stay in
port ; for soon, though terrible their ciastis-
nienit had been of the pirates, reports of new
outrages along the Coast cane to their ears;
and they found that the pirates, instead of ho-
ing utterly extermiiated, were yet numerous,
and qven powerful on the coast. 'Thierefore,
both the English and American men-of-war
were soon off igrin to renew their exertions to
destroy the destroyers.

have aecumiulated upon his head.

reached out his hand, as if he would touch
her.

"Yes, I will go with you-yes--yes--vs!
I will go with you."  And she retreated step
by step in froiit of the pirate, motioning her
almost pa'rilyzd father hack as she went.
The wretheud marquis stood for a moment
as if spell-bound, and then, with a wild cry of
agony, stepped but a single step forward, and
fell senseless to the floor.
When loe reeovered his senses, his startled
servants were aronul him, but his daughter
was not there. ie asked where she was, but
no one knew.   Ard when he spoke of Colce'-

"What is that ?" asked Maraquita. And

to the back of the kind of dais, or throne on
which he sat.
" My guard, pretty one-my guard I 'Is it
not, my men ?"
Some of them   turned pale, and others
laughed, as he asked the question. They
knew well what it was, and that a match ap-
plied to the mouth of that serpent would fire
a train which would blow them all into atoms.
"Yes, yes-I have eard of it before," she
said. " With it you hold, indeed, a kingly

And she smiled-smiled so stranrey that it
was wonderful that he had no thought of the
fire in her brain and heart which was now all
ablaze.
