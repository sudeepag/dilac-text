ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.

CHAPTER I.
The Captve and their L dian Cef.
UPON the road which windM from the
village of Coosa, in the former territory
of the Creeks, towards the capital of
Georgia, there stood, about twenty years
ago, under a projecting shelf of rocks,
on which some dozen of red cedar and
pine trees were scattered, the humble
log cabin of John Copeland; or, as he
was generally styled, Captain John.
Before it was two huge posts, connect-
ed by two large cross-beams; between
which was swinging in the blast a large
sign daubed with a gaudy copper figure,
intending to represent an Indian king,
with his diadem of plumes, tomahawk,
scalping knife, girdle of wampum, and
so forth; Beneath this figure, in words
not unlike Egyptian hieroglyphics, was
scrawled, "Entertainment for Man and
east."
it was on a stormy December night-
the wind moaned wildly through the
black pine forest, on the verge of which
the cabin was.situated-rain, mingled
with hail, dashed against the window
shutters, threatening the inmates every
moment with a deluge ; while the crush-
ing of trees, broken down by the storm,
sounded like peals of thunder through
the dark abode of Captain John-when,
something like the tapping of a hand on
the weatherboard of the door was soon
succeeded by a knocking that shook the
very logs of which the cabin was con-
structed.
Immediately upon this summons the
door opened, and a head peered out into
the dark night, as if to reconnoitre the
ground around the door, just where the

butt-end of a rifle was advanced-doubt-
less with the benevolent intention of
saving the inmate the trouble of open-
ing it.
The foremost of a group of beings,
whose characters could not be ascer-
tained in the dark, came forward, threw
the door wide open, entered, and, strid-
ing towards the chimney with a haughty
step, there sat down.
A considerable time elapsed before
about twenty of his followers stalked
into the room, in the same silent and
haughty manner.
When the hat had entered, the per-
son who had opened the door shut it
again; and, stepping towards the fire-
place, where a large log was still glim-
mering, threw a couple of dry faggots
over it, kindled one of the pine torches
lying near, and moving deliberately to-
wards the bar, placed a lighted candle
upon it.
The rude objects of the room appear-
ed now more distinctly ie the livid glare
of the torch and the wavering light of
the candle.
On a chair, before the fireplace, sat
the personage who had first entered-
his blood-stained blanket was thrown
over his whole body, so as entirely to
conceal his form.
Behind him, on the fioor, a group of
about twenty-Live Indians sat on their
haunches, with their legs crossed, their
fees shrouded in their wet blankets;
while large blood-stains,. with which
these were tinged, betrayed the charac-
ter of the expedition they came from.
In the corner opposite the fireplace
stood the bar, behind whose railings a
dozen dirty bottles, and still dirtier
tumblers and mugs, were ranged.

The landlord now seated himself by
the side of him who seemed the chief of
the band.
Another minute elapsed before this
personage roused his head, two-thirds
of which were concealed by a piece of
cotton tied round it, on which, like
fringes, little clots of gore hung.
The backwoodsman cast a side glance
at the Indian, but withdrew his eye at
the next moment, and looked again into
the crackling fire.
"Has my white brother no tongue'?"
now said the Indian, in a low, guttural
tone.
"He will listen to the talk of the brave
chief," returned the backwoodsman,
sullenly.
"Go call your woman," said the In-
di in, in the same low tone, without
raising his head.
rTie backwoodsman arose, and turned
towards a large bed, behind whose cur-
tains the woman was sitting.
After a few words she emerged from
her resting place, and advanced by the
side of her husband towards the Indian
chief.
She was a stout, resolute-looking wo-
man; yet there was something so very
alarming in the blood-stained visitors,
illumined as they were by occasional
flashes from the glaring flame, ahd their
deadly silence was so ominous, that the
woman stood speechless with terror.
Stepping to the .ide of her husband,
she stood in silent expectation.
The Indian now raised his head very
slowly, and said-
"Listen, woman, to the talk of a great
warrior. Hig hinds are open, and he
will fill the wigwam of his white brother
with deer skins ; he will ask but little
from her, and what she may give easily.
Has my sister," continued he, turning
his head to wards the woman, "milk for
a little sister ?"
The woman looked astonished at the
question, without comprehending his
meaning.
"Will she," continued the Indian,
raising his voice a tone higher, "give of
her milk to a little sister, that she may
not die for want of food ?"
The woman looked bolder, as she now
began to comprehend the demand, and
she moved from her husband to theside
of the Indian.
As she did so, the Indian opened the
folds of his blanket, and produced a
beautiful child, dressed in a rich emine
pelisse, and cap of the same.

For a moment the woman gazed In
astonishment, but in the next her fe-
male tenderness prevailed. Stretching
out her hand to receive the child, she
exclaimed---
"Body o' me ! a baby! Where have
you got that there poor little thing? It
ain't a red child-surely I will-"
The woman would probably have
given further vent to her feelings, but
for a significant glance from her hus--
band.
The Indian seemed not to pay the
least attention to what she said, but,
unbuttoning the ermine pelisse, he slip
ped the garment off. A robe of gros de
Naples presented itself. The Indian
untied it in the same manner, knot after
knot, and had succeeded in extracting
the child from a second robe, when a
third, fourth and fifth of the finest cam-
bric, trimmed with Brussels lace, ap-
peared, within which the child was
buried.
The Indian seemed now to lose pa-
tience, seizing his scalping-knife, and
cutting the three remaining garments
asunder, he presented the naked child
to the terrified hostess.
"You wretch !" shrieked the frighten-
ed woman, snatching the child from
him.                 -
"Stay," said the Indian, pointing to
the neck of the child, from which hMng
a gold chain with a little medal.
'rhe woman slipped the chain overits
head, and throwing it into' the face of
the Indian, she hurried towards her bed.
"The deuce is in that woman," mut-
tered the backwoodsman, not without
uneasiness, at the sadden outbroaking
of his wife's feelings.
"The red warrior," said the Indian,
with unmovable calmness, "will give
beavers' skins for the milk of his sister;
but he will keep what he has picked up,
and the door must be open when he calls
for the child !"
"But," said the backwoodsman, who
seemed to feel it incumbent on him to
be more explicit; " to speak plainly, I
don't care to keep the child, though I
have plenty of my own. Eut should
the parents come, or the white father
hear of it, what then? the chief knows
that his hands reach far."
The Indian paused a moment, and
then said, in a significant tone-
'"The child's mother will not come,
The night is very dark, the storm blows
very hard, the trail of the red warrior
will not be seen to-morrow. it is far to

the wigwam of the white father. If-h
hears of ,the child, the my white bro
her~ told him of it. If he takes it, tht
red warrior will take the scalps off hi
children."
"There, take bick your child-I will
not have anything to do with it !" said
the backwoodsman, in a firm and reso-
Ante tone-.        .    ..
The Indian drew his knife in calm,
concentrated rage, and looked in the
direction of the child.
"We'll take care of it-nobody shall
know of it!" shrieked the woman in a
voice alhnost of frenzy.,    ;
The Indian put his knife calmly in his
belt, "The red nen are dry," said he,'
in the same tone.
The woman muttered something like
pomson.
The husband, however, now strode
somewhat more rapidly towards the bar
-took down one of the bottles and fill-
ed a tumbler, which the chief drank as
he sat. It then passed round to every
Indian'
When the third bottle was emptied,
the chief rose abruptly, threw a Spanish
gold piece on the table, and, taking
from his girdle of wampum a neckcloth
of beads, hung it round the neck of the
child, which the woman had in the
meanwhile dressed in a homespun flan-
nel frock.
"The Creeks will know the child of
one of their warriors," said he- and,
turning round, he stalked with great
dignity towards the door, followed in
the same manner by his ien, and dis-
aippeared in the dark night.
"The squall is over," said the back-
woodsman, who had looked after the
Indians, as they stole towards their
birchen canoe.
"Who's that red demon ?" his wife
broke forth, when the last had disap-
peared, fetching at the same time a deep
breath,.and shuddering involuntarily.
"Hush, woman! There's foul play, I
warrant ye!" said he, shutting the door
and stepping with the lighted candle
towards the bed, where his wife was
nursing her new charge. "That there
poor thing might tell a story, maybe,
that we should not like to listen to !
Ay, and she may cost us our scalps, too.
There's something wrong -- they have
been, on a scalping expedition; that's
certain; but where, the deuce knows.
Well, if they've been down at the Span-
iard's," continued he, looking alter-
nately at the child and at the gold coin;

e "I shouldn't care a curse ; but things
- must be looked to."
e So saying, he threw himself upon the
bed.
But it was long before the sturdy old
l backwoodsman sank again asleep. The
terrible night scene seemed to have de-
stroyed his repose.
Captain John was one of those li-
censed traders who had settled two
years before this'nightly visit among
the Creeks, under the patronage of the
general government, and the protection
of its agent.
He was a man half way between
thirty and forty, as stout and square
built "as any one who ever trod in his
own shoes," and with just as much of
tavern-keeper jollity as corresponded
with his grave customers and his own
bargaining, shrewd hawk-eye.
The Creeks had been for many years
on good terms witg the white people.
Yet there were among them the germs
of a rising discontent; which, perhaps,
none was able to observe more closely
than our tavern keeper.
Numberless squatters settled down on
the richest tracts.  Dissensions had
broken out respecting the occupation of
the lands on the head of the Oconee
river.
The difference had been settled by a
treaty, in which the chief of the Oco-
nees, the son of a white, ceded the fer-
tile lands.
The greater part of the tribe, with
the descendants of the Ahikos or heirs
of the Oconees, were thus cast on the
mercy of their red brethren.
He was said to be of a haughty, stern
and treacherous character -his influ-
ence with his tribe to be unlimited, and
even great with the rest of the Creeks,
who began to be alarmed for their re-
ainaing land.
The backwoodsman, then, knowing
the dangerous character of the Indians
among whom he lived, not to distrust
them, he determined on visiting M'Lel-
lan, the deputy agent, in the ippeir.
Creeks' territory, the next morning.
This purpose firmly settled, he soon fell
asleep.
Accordingly, with the break of day,
the backwoodsman was ready to start
for the agent's.
"Send Tomba with the skins up to
the Cherokees, and keep yourself quite
ready, if I shouldn't come back to-mor-
row night," said he.

ROBA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.

12             ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.

The Indian looked for a moment very
attentively ; and then crying "Hue !"
and raising his hands with every mark
of fear and astonishment, darted over
the fence, and was soon lost to the eye.
The missionary and the backwoods-
man returned silently into the room.
"Well," said the latter, with a sharp
glance, "have you still a mind to the
child ?"
"Certainly," said the preacher, "if
you allow me to speak with the agent."
"Not as long as I stay with these red
skins," said the tavern keeper. "But
my time will be short. They are again
stirring; and there are things going on
with that red skin beyond the Ohio.
They say it is the chief of the Oconees,
or moiko, as they call him."
"That's a dangerous fellow," said the
clergyman.
"When I am down the Misdssippi,"
resumed the backwoodsman, "you may
do what you please."
"Sure enough," interjected mine host-
ess; "poor thing, she'll never be fit for
a job, and you nouglit as well take her.
She bought do for teaching them girls ;
but we must think of ourselves."
The strain of the woman was inter-.
rupted by a piercing cry, which came
from the garden.
The next moment the object of their
conversation rushed in, pale and trem-
bling.
Before they could ask the cause of her
strange emotion, a tall, gaunt and co-
lossal Indian steipped into the room,
dressed in the attire of an Indian chief
of the first rank. His frame was very
powerful. On his naked arms and an-
covered temples arose seams almost
finger thick.
His whole attitude was imposing in a
high degree, and resembled more of a
bronze statue than a living creature.
The most striking part, however, of the
Indian was his countenance. His fore-
head,erowned with a diadem of plumes,
was highly intellige it.
The dress of this remarkable person
consisted of a sort of waistcoat of deer
skin, that covered his broad chest, and
an open hunting shirt of cotton, which
was thrown over it. To a girdle of wam-
paim was attached his breech-cloth. His
moccasins and leggings were exquisitely
worked. Ie held in his right hand a
ride ,and on his side stuck a scalping-
kuite, richly inlaid with silver.
"Tokeam !" exclaimed the missionary.
The backwoodsman was just going to

raise his tumbler to his lips; but his
appetite seemed gone at the mention of
a name which was known to be synony-
mous to a deadly enemy of the whites.
He surveyed the chief from head to
foot.
"Six summers," said the Indian, after
a long pause, during which he had seat-
ed himself, "are gone and returned
since the miko of the Oconees left his
daughter with his white brother. Ho
is come to take her now into his own
wigwam."
"Then it is you," said the captain,
"who that night left us poor Rose, as
that there' gentleman calls her. But
why have you never shown yourself, or
called for the child ? What if she had
been lost?"
" The white man want only the skies
and the land of the red men-they enre
not for a chief," returned the Indian,
with a bitter smile. "If the child had
beer taken away, the scalps of your
children would have paid for it. He
will now take what is his own:"
"You don't call Rose, whose parents
you have murdered, your own ?" said
the minister.
The Indian cast a glance of inexpres-
sihle contempt at the speaker as he rc-
ph-.
"Where would the White Rose, as
you call her, be, if the hand of Tokeahk
had not arrested the arm which was
going to dash out her bra~imis? Who has
hunted for her when she crawled on her
hands and feet ? Who has sent the
be vers' skins and drink water?  Oa
added he, with contempt, "you are dogs
-your tongue talks of what your heart
does not know."
''The miko of the Oconees," said the
missionary, undaunted by the cold ve-
hemence of the Indian, "will not tear a
poor Christian child from iher kindred ?
The whi e father would be angry-ho
will pay back the skins."
"No need of that," cried the woman ;
"I'll give back all what the red skin
clief has sent."
"The chief of the Oconees," said the
Indian, in a stern tone, "will not talk
more with the white father. His path
is long-his heart yearns after freedom.
He will seek it where no white maa,has
trodden the ground. He wants his white
daughter to pook his venison." lie then
wha-tled, and a party of Indians enter-
ed, followed by two girls.
"Canondah !" exclaimed the mission-
Sry.

One of the girls stepped forward, and
crossing her hands on  er bosom, she
inclined her head towards the mission-
ary.
"And you will leave us?" he said.
The girl was silent.
The chief made another sign ; and
the second girl seized the shrieking child
and lifted her itito a blanket, which was
thrown over the shoulder of the first.
the then passed a string round the hips
of the child, and tied it, raised her to
the shoulders of the girl, and wound
her arms round her neck. The Indian
girl took now the upper corners of the
blanket, and drawing them together in
Mher hand, she was ready to depart.
The missionary, with the family of the
trader, had looked at these sudden pre-
parations in anxious suspense.
When they were finished, the mission-
ary advanced to the Indian and said, in
a mild voice-
"Then to your love and sisterly care
I must leave the tender plant!"
The Indian girl on whose back the
poor child hung, bowed her head.
The girls left the room with the rest
of the Indians-the chief only remained
behind. Then rising, he said -
"The miko of the Oconees has paid
for the milk of the white woman. His
path is long-his heart is sick of the
whites - may he never more behold
them!"
When ho had spoken these words, he
rose, stalked out of the room, leaving
the missionary and the trader in silent
Surprise.
We now leave Georgia, and the home
of the backwoodsman, to resume the
thread of our narrative in a far distant
country, and after .the lapse of several
years.
.           cHAPTER IL
The Two Maidens.
On the northern extremity of the lake
Sabine, there rises from the dreary cane
and cypress swamps, and between the
rival rivers, Sabine and Natchez, a rich
bottom that swells gradually, as the two
rivers diverge into the hills.
From the narrow lane which nature
has left between the forest and the cane
brake, two female forms were seen glid-
ing towards an open place.
The complexion of the foremost maid-
,an showed the copper hue of the Indiga

race. She had now reached a bend of
the lane, where a prostrate cotton tree
crossed the opening, and leaned herself
against the trunk, apparently to catch
breath.
By her side hung a pocket knife of
considerable size.
"Rosa," she said, bounding towards
the second female who had now issued
from beneath a cotton tree, and sinking
on her legs, and crossing them with a
quickness and pliancy which resembled
the windings of a serpent. "Thte White
Rose is no more the same-look how the (
grass grows on the path her foot has
trod so often. Why is the White Rose
sad?"
There was something so touching 'in
the voice of the Indian-her attitude,
as she cast her arms round the form of
the second female; was so beseeching,
as made it doubtful whether her interest
was relationship on her part, or the ex-
quisite beauty of the object before whom
she was seated.
The soft black eye, rolling languidly
under its long silken lashes, and repos-
ing oi the Indian, gave her the air of
an ethereal being.
This beautiful female was, in fact,
Rosa, whom we have seen,' seven years
ago, carried away by the Indian chief.
She looked on her red friend'with an
air of the gentlest tenderness-a tear
stole into her eyes-and, bending her
head, she' pressed a kiss on' the lips of
the Indian maiden.
"Why has the White15tlsgo tongue?"
resumed the Indian in the same touch-
ing tone. "Look! Canondah's bosom
is now open for the woes of the White
Rose."
"Dear Canondah," lisped the fair
being, throwing her arms round the
neck of the Indian.
"0. tell Canondah," prayed the In-
dian, "what it is that afflicts your ten-
der. heart?" then changing on a sudden
into a plaintive tone-"Look," she ex-
claimed, "these arms have carried the
White Rose when ohe was very little-
on these shoulders she hung when we
crossed the big river. On this bosom she
nestled like a water fowl. And now she
is grown big, and has become the White
Rose of the Oconees, she will shut her
heart. 0, tell Canondah, what it is that
heaves your bosom, and makes you pale
and trembling ?"
Rosa-for by this name we shall now
call her-looked at her friend for a mo-
mnt; she then whispered, as if afraid

of being overheard-"'There is," point-
ing at her breast, "one thing, that I
cannot tell, which fills my heart with
paii and woe."
"Is it the great chief of theSalt Lake,

Rsa grew pile, she stepped back,
and covered her face with her hands.
The Indian sprang from the ground,
and throwing her arm round her friend,
borh walked on in silence.
Theystood now on the verge of the
cane brake.
"Saud is the path of an Oconee girl !"
broke out the Indian after a long pause
-but li-ten !" exclaimed she, turning
her cear towards the stream, from whence
a f sint, distant, rustling noise was now
heard-' iWhat is that t"
",, nothing," returned Rosa.
The noise, though faint, was now- dis-
imeÂ° ly heard.
'"Canondah !" exclaimed Rosa, " you
will not hunt the great water serpent?"
But her words were in vain.
The Indian darted, with the swiftness
of a deer, through the dense canebrake,
and nothing remained for her compan-
ion bun to follow the crashing sounds
that pointed out to her the direction in
which she had broken through.
While she wound herself through the
mazes of the reeds, a piercing shriek
was heard; but it was not the voice of
Canoundah. A plunge succeeded, f 4-
lowed by a short, violent struggle; then
a deep silence ensued.
Rosa now followed, breathless, to-
wards the stream.   After a toilsome
march, she at last reached the edge of
the bank, and her eye soughther Indian
friend.
"Rosa !" exclaimed the Indian, who
stood in tihe shallow water.
"Cauoudah !" said Rosa ; but the In-
dian pointed towards a cypress tree that
StOoi below the bank.
"The white youth I" demanded Rosa,

water's edge.

"how came he here ?" asked Rosa, in
a low whisper, with her eyes riveted on
the stranger.
The Indiam punted to a yawl in-the
palmettos, and which the younrg-man
had evidently tried to toree through the,
reeds.
He had now nearly reached-the shore,
when he became exhausted. He stag-
gered, the reed yielded to the weight,
and he was on the point of sinking,
when he was caught by the Indian and
drawn towards the bank, against which
she leaned him.
The cause of the stranger's weakness
now appeared. The jaws of an alligator
had seized the might leg, and the blood
gushed froan a fearful wound.
Tie Indian had no sooner remarked
it, than she hastened to the side of
Rosa, and untying the silk handkerchief
from Roa's neck, with the words -
"Your white brother is bitten, and you
see Canondah has but her gown," ran
with it in her mouth towards a patina-
christi. She broke the -tem across her
knee, and loosened the soft rind that lay
under the bark. She then got down by
the side of the stranger, staunched the
blood with the soft. fibres, and tied the
silk handkerchief round it.
rley now laid him on the ground.
His eyes were closed, and his hands
hung down on both sides.
lIe seemed on the point of dissolu-
tion.
Rosa had stood:gazing in silence--
then lifting up her hand in a supplicat-
ing manner, she looked at the Indian.
11cr friend seemed to comprehend the
silent language; for, casting a tong and
anxious glance at the stranger, she cx-
claimed-
"Your white brother is come in the
canoe of the great chief, but he is none
of his warriors!"
"He is, perhaps, a sailor."
"No," said the Indian-"look at his
hands--they look like a girl's."
"Perhaps a runner ?" said Rosa.
The Indian shook her head. "Look!
he came from the salt lake through the
big lake that dinuks the water of our
stream ; bat he does not know how to
paddle a canoe through the high grass.
He thought the serpent was a rotten
log, and he trod on it, aid it has buiied
its teeth in his flesh. Your white brother
has fled Iroim the great chief." She said
these words with great decision and
tinmness, as though she had been the
stranger's companion.

"And, will Canondab cause the blood
of a brother to be shed, who has never
done any harm to her ?" said Rosa, in
a beseeching tone.
The Indian looked at her friend, and
paused a moment.
At length she said-
"Well, Canondah will listen to the
voice of her sister that speaks for the
white youth.".
So saying, both girls tripped away,
-and penetrated farther into the forest,
towards the trunk of an immense holy
low cotton tree that stood *on the slop-
ing ground.
rfbe interior of the hollow tree was
wide enough to admit of six men. The
care which had been taken to clear it
from the rubbish, and a neighboring
salt lick, showed that it was used by the
Indians for their nightly walks -
Canondahi approached the tree with a
wary step, and entered it in the same
cautions manner.
"It is empty," said she, "and the
bears won't come !"
. Both girls now ran towards a couple
of cypresses that stood farther towards
the bottom, found the salt-lick, and
tearing the long floating mazes of Span-
ish muss from the trees, collected a load
that promised a soft couch, with which
they hastened towards the cave.
While Rosa was spreading the horse-
hair like plant on the ground,the Iudian
moved two logs near to the entrance, to
secure the passage against unwelcome
intruders.
"Good!" said she, when these prepa-
ratories 'were fiished; and poth girls
returned to the stranger.
"But he is very weak," said Rosa,
"and cannot walk."
"We must carry him !" replied the'
Indian.
Rosa blushed deeply.
But the Indian, without paying any
further attention to her delicate feelings,
bowed down, and putting her right
hand between the turf and his limbs,
made her companion a sign.
"Is Rosa afraid of touching her white
brother, when the walk will cause him
so much pain ' she said, with mild re-
proach.
The maiden now dropped her arm;.
and both raised him on their clasped
hands, supporting his back in the same
manner, Thus they carried him to his
couch. When they had laid him down,
the indian whispered-
"Canondah will be here when all is

dark, and pour balsam into the wound
of her white brother !"
But her wOrdsvere lost; for, except
a heavy breatlh,the stranger gave hardly
a sign of life.
The last rays of the setting sun had
just touched the hills, when the girls
arrived again on the spot where they
had gathered the grapes ; and theyre-
turned the same way which they came,
towards their wigwams, to which we
shall introduce our readers, anticipat-
ing, however, their arrival by a few
hours.
CHAPTER III.
The iivdhli E'awint.
Notfar from the scene of our adven-
trie there was a considerable clearing,
which ran for two miles along the river,
stretching half a mile from its margin
towards the forest, 'when the level plain
sloped gently into the cypress bottom.
On a near approach, gray blue smoke
might be seen curling through the mel-
low foliage ; and here and there a single
cabin, nestling beneath a broad syca-
more, and surrounded by patches of
Indian corn and tobacco; and a dusky
form stealing through the shrubs in that
wary manner which long habit renders
natural to tie red race, indicated an
Indian village. These outposts passed,
the number of dwellings increased, and
might amount to about fifty.
Mo-t of the cabins were without win-
dows. In lieu of the door hung a buffalo
hide, fastened on the door beams, and
flung, during day time, on the low roof
of the cabin.
There were, however; two cabins, or
rather cottages, of a lar-ger size. Both
nestledhlik the rest, under a cotton
tree.
In front of one of those larger cabins,
under a grove of palm trees and man-
gtoves, sat a knot of about fifty men,
enveloped in a column of dense smoke,
that proceeded from pipes two or three
feet in length.
They were almost all of them dressed
iii hunting shirts of cotton, their chests
bare, with their girdles of wampum, to
which their breech-cloth was attached
by a thong around their shoulders, and
their tobacco pouches hung. They wore
their hair, and none had a scalping,
tuft.

ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.

"The woods, where Tokeah has once
hunted as a chief, as a mighty miko, he
has beheld again like a thief, when the.
sun was down-he' has seen his people,
which was the flower of the red men,
weltering in the mud."
When he had spoken these last words,
his head sank again into his hands.
A deep pause ensued.
"And has the great mike riot talked
to his brethren ?" demanded now the
same old man.
The chief raised his head, and looked
at the speaker with a calm dignity.
"Has gay brother forgotten that the
red men of his people have cut asunder
the link which tied him to them, that
he had to fly from the land of his fa-
thers. A fool will talk twice. His
brethren have shut their ears seven sum-
mers ago, when it was time to strike the
blow; but his tongue was tied fast,
when he saw his father's grave the last
time-his heart was with his true men."
"Before long," continued he, "the
Creeks will be turned out of their own
lands; they will drive them after the
elks and deer that have sought the
woods beyond the big river, and the
Creeks will seek a police .for their wig-
wams on this side of the big river. Then
will Tokeah extend his hands to receive
them-he will open his wigwam. His
men have plenty of venison and corn,
and his girls know how to weave hunt-
ing shirts-he will divide with his men
what he has, and join the link which is
now broken."
A loud, but respectful burst of ap-
plause followed the last words of the
chief, who again laid his head between
his hands.
The sun now sank amidst a flood of
glory, mantling the hill, which was sur-
rounded on every side by a thousand
glorious dyes, reflected from the various
tints of the foliage.
The miko cast a last, long glance at
 theligesug rays as they laded away ;
and then moving his feetforwads, rose
en the ground, slowly and 'maaj "tieally,
with  the assistance of his hands.
His rising vas a signal for the rest,

nanner, seemed for a moment as if they.
were growing out of the earth.

large cabin, and alter having entered it,

The interior of the cottage was very
simple, but extremely inviting. It con-
sisted of two apartments - separated

"from each by two folds of carpet. Both
had glazed windows, and the floor and
walls were matted.
A long table stood near one end of the
apartment, and the nicety of the ar-
rangement of the simple furniture, be.
trayed the tasteful hand of a female. On
one side of the wall hung a costly rifle of
American manufacture, next to a fowl-
ing piece, and then a beautiful double-
barrelled gun from Versailles. On the
opposite side were placed the various
implements of Indian warfare-quivers
of deer and alligator skin, bows, scalp-
ing knives and tomahawks.
In the midst of these weapons, hung
a bag curiously worked in wampum,
containing probably the arcana of mys-
tic medicine,which the descendant of the
inikos had inherited from his ancestors;
and to which, perhaps, he owed his au-
thority over his tribe, as much as to his
distinguished qualities as a warrior and
hunter.
. The twilight, so short in these regions,
had settled into obscure darkness, when
two female forms entered $the apart-
ment.
"My children have stayed long," said
the old man, without looking up.
"They have gathered the grape, which
my father likes so well," returned one
of the females.
"Good !'' was the answer.
Canondah-for it was she who had re-
turned with Rosa-now took an earthen
vase, and put some of the grapes in it;
then placing a dish with dried venison
and parched maize on the table, she
filled an earthen mug and handed it to
her father. C
The Indian drank, and put it on the
table, then cut a few thin slices from
the dried haunch, and took a handful of
parched corn.
Hi repast vas as short as the prepa-
parat ons were, and scarcely a minute
had elapsed, ' when the dishes were're-
moved.
"Are not, my children hungry ?" de'
manded he, after he had fiuished his
repast.
"They have eaten of the grape."
"Godt'!" said the old man, reclining
again his head upon his hands.
The girlihad no sooner observed this
movement, than she glided forward and
si'iking down before the chief, she fold-
ed her arms on.lher bosom. He laid his
hands on both her shoulders, as if oless-

filed with water. But the great chief
of the Salt Lake will dry it."
An involuntary sigh escaped the fair
maiden - she began to weep and sob:
aloud._
'The White Rose," said the chief, in
the same told and steady toie' "will
be the wife of a great warrior, who will
fill her wigwam with the spoils taken
from her enemies. Her hands will never
do work, and will be envied by all the
squaws."
When he had spoken these words, he
raised his legs on the low couch, and,
shrouding himself in, his blanket, and
lying down, soon fell asleep.
Canondah seized th~e hand of the fair
girl, and drawing .her into their room,
laid her inger on her mouth ; then lead-
ing her to her couch, she pressed her
gently down.
Rosa seemed to understand the mean-
ing of the Judian girl, and was silent,
But it was in vain she closed her eyes-
the pale, sufbring form of the stranger
stood before it. There was a storm ris-
ing inher guileless heart that seemed to
banish all rest.
Minute after minute passed, hour after'
hour, and still, she could not sleep. At
last a stir in te front room announce
that their chief was awake.
Canondah sprang up from .her couch,
and, as if aware of Rosa's restlessness,
she stepped lose up to her, once more
laid her finger on her lips, and then has-
tened into her father's room.
The chief's preparations for the en-
suing hunt were soon finished, He east

large powder-horn round his shoulders;
and putting his long knife in his girdle,
took up his double -barrelled gun. One
of the young men cameto.carry the'bow
and quiver with a bag filled with pro-
visions.
When the old man stepped out-into
the avenue, he found the whole band of
his warriors and hunters alreadyassem-
bled.
They had assembled from their cabins
in the same silent manner, and they
glided now behind their chief towards
the bank of the river, and into their
canoes, with a stealth which had some-
thing appalling-startling.
They have gone,"' said Canondah,
who had accompanied the train to the
water's edge, and again returned.
"Then let us hasten to the youth I"
said Rosa-

now run after the.miko. Canondah will
look to the 'stranger, but her sister must
sleep!"
So saying, Canondah pressed the fair
maiden gently on her couch, and disap-
peared behind the folds.
Whether the tender language of her
friend, whose faithfulness and sisterly
love she knew, or her weariness con-
tributed more to enforce this command,
we are not able to determine. Sh,'how-
ever, soon sank into a profound repose.

The morning scarcely began to dawn,
when 'the, dusky forms of the squaws
and of their :daughters were seen hob-
bling and gliding towards the spot where
their men and fathers. had embarked a
few hours before.
Canondah tripped towards herfather's
cottage. She found Rosa still sleeping.
A tender smile played round the beau-
tiful mouth --her finely modelled lips
moved and whispered.
Canondah 'ent - over the enchanting
form, and could nOt resist pressing a kiss

which she was playing upon her Indian

ROSA, Ti 9 1 IA APTPTR

SOSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.

The Indian,whose additional six years
had doubtless rendered her more. expe-,
rienced in those little stratagems, one of
which her friend seemed willing to prac-
tise, broke out into a loud fit of merry
laugh hter.
"B t, Canondah," said she, "how you
delight to torment poor Rosa !"
"Look there," said the Indian, "how
the White Rose has turned a cheat in,
onenight-sre will tell her sister of the
trail and broken cane.,Sie cares no
mote about them than the mike for his
beads, while her heart thinks on he
-white youth.  ,anondi will whip her
White Rose for it. But come," added
she, handing her a dress of somewhat
coarser materials than that she wsre
the day pre vious--"Rosa must take this,
and cheat the squaws too !"
T he maiden slipped, with a sigh, into
the caieo gown, flung a silk handker-
chief over her bosom, and tripped be-
fohe tie cabin, where a clear spring was
bubbling. In a few moments she was
again at the side of the Indian, who
pointed to the table where their break-
fast was standing- two baskets with
grapes and cakes of Indian corn, and a
cup filled with milk.
Rousa waited in silence for the moment
when the Indian would open the con-
versation, casting only now and then a
shy glance at her; but the dogged girl
remained obstinate, and she glided si-
lently through the door as soon as she
had done eating.
Rosa sat down to her little work-table
with a sigh, to busy herself over a gown
which she intended for Canondah's bri-
dal dress,
Perhaps three hours might have
elapsed, when the Indian returned, a
smile of satisfaction played over her
countenance, 'and, taking Rosa's liondi,
she drew the maiden afterer towards
the bank of the stream, and the harbor
where the women and girls were assem-
'led around the canoe, waiting only for
the daughter of their chief.
"Rosa is very timid," said, she, turn-
ing towards the woman -" she cannot
go along ." and the three girls bounded
with a single leap into the bark that
floated as light as afeather on the beau-
tiful stream. A shout of joy burst tromn
the lips of the multitude.
Canondah waved her hand gracefully,
and szed the paddle. The canoe dart-
ed a short distance up the stream, turn-
ed sulhienil down, again they lew up,
nal ageim glided down the treat.

All at once a sudden, piercing cry was
beard from the direction in which the
canoe had shot along.
For a moment, the women, girls and
boys stood still, aund the next tlbey scam
pered and hobbled away on the path
along time cane-brake, and in the direc-
tion where woleft the stranger.
Rosa grew pale, and she turned, with
a faltering step, towards the well-known
path, following the multitude with a
pamiting.heart.
She had a guess of the device of her
friend, but dawning love is anxious, and.
Rosa began to feel its symptoms.
When sh 'arrived near the cotton
tree, the last of the train, she found
squaws, girls and boys collected round
the stranger, a sullen and wondering
group.-
A hollow murmur rolled ,round the
dark circle-in the midst of, and only -a
few paces from, the 'youth, :Canondah
was standing.
The youth leaned on the trunk of the
tree with his eyes closed, insensible to
what passed around humn.
"Look !" said the Indian, waving her
hand to the squaws,'who now upend
the ring, and speaking with that asst-
rance which marked all her doings and
sayings-" Look,! the'great chief of the
Salt Lake hassent a ruuner' in his ca-
nes, anti he has been bitten by the ser-
pent of the water."
She spo'ke these words with so- much
unconcern, that the .assembled crowd of
squaws and girls had not the least sus-
picion of any deception practised upon
them.
Sene of the old squaws were seen
creeping towards the cane-brake ; but
Canondab left them no furthei- scrutiny.
Waving her hand, she directed some of
the girls to prepare a litter.
They obeyed instantly-cut two sap-
lings down, laid stems of cane across,
and covered them'with'tallimndsea. To
this couch the youth could be safely
trusted, and the female commander once
more waved her hand, and, putting the
train under the superintendence of Rosa,
she darted with her two companions
again through the cane-brake.
The group moved slowly afd in si-
lence towards the village, where they
found Canondah, who had returned in
the birchen canoe, already waiting. She
preceded them to the cottageof her fa-
tier. She opened the door, and point-
inig to th bench, the bearrs laid the

ounded stranger down. The crowd
remained outside
"Rosa past stay here, while Canon-
dahis tal ing with the squaws." And.
so saving she slided out into the aye-
nue, with an air which seemed to soften
a little her father's austerity.
The maiden sat down on the bench,
anxiously looking at the youth, who lay
deadly pale,. and shaking badly with the.
symptoms .of a wound fever, that had
increased-during his. exposure to the
damp night air.
Canoudoh again entered at the door,
through which, after some minutes, she
was followed by an old squaw, who cat-
nid a bundle of dry herbs in her hand.
Thehidepusarepresentative o scula-
plus,-for such was her capaci y, hobbled
towards the youth, made a deep examni-'
nation, and again trotted off.
"To-morrow the cold will be' gone,"
said Canondaih; "hut we must not pour
more balsam into his wound."
The old squaw came again with aket-
tie that contained a decoetion of herbs.
She poured part of it into a mug; and,
while Canondah raised the patient, she
presented it to him...
He opened his. dim, almost sunken
eyes, but shut them again, and suffered
the old squaw to pour the drug into his
mouth.
Soon after he had taken the draught,
drops of perspiration began to appear
on his forehead.
Making a significant gesture with her
hand, the old squaw shrunk out of the
room.
The female council seemed to have
left on the countenance of Canondah a
sternness that caused poor Rosa a slight
tremor, when the Indian girl seized her
hand and led her into the inner apart-
ment.       -
"Rosa," said the Indian, when they
were seated on the couch in their little
room, "Canonlah lhan cheated the eyes
of the squaws of her people, that she
may lighten the smile of joy on the fair
cheeks of her sister."
She paused.
After a little, the Indian girl again
epoke-.
"She has taken the enemy of her peo-
ple and of the chief of the Salt Lake
into the wigwam of her. father - the
spy!"
"0, no, Canondah I" exclaimed Rosa ;
"look only into the face of my brother.
Does he look as if his tongue was false0

Does he look like an enemy of his own
people l"
"My sister is very young, and does
not know the enemy of the white peo-
pie. They send their young men into
the villages of the red people to count
their cattle, and. their corn fields, and
their skins;-and when they return, they
show their brethi-eu the path that leads
to the red villages, and they come and
take all from them, and drive them into
the woods."
"And does mysister think," returned
Rosa, timidly, "that the youth is one of
the spies'!".
Th1eiesIndian shook her head doubt-
fuly.
"Does he not speak with their tongue?
Look, my sister," added1)sheafter a mo
ment's reflection, "Canondak has ex-
tended her hand in- friendship. towards
the stranger, when she saw that the
heart of the White Rose yearned 'after
him; but she has not acted like the
daughter of the- great miko-she has
put the night-between him and tJi miko
--and now she takes Jhim into her fa-
ther's wigwam when he has left it !"
"But he would have died of his fear-
ful wounds in the woods. Look 'how
he trembles with cold ! rIfhe fever, too,

"And the miko," said the Indian, "he

"Must he kndw of the stranger?

of giving utterance to her words.
A light smile of scorn. passed across
the countenance of theIndian girl.,-

white men, her father will see.'
"And m.' brother 1" said Rosa, trem-
bling.
"Will learn to die," said the girl, with
a firm, decided tone. "But the youth is
hungry, and Canondah must cook for
him."
Rosa now followed the Indian with a
trembling heart.
Five hours had passed, and the moon
stood high, when a light stir from the
patient told that he was waking.
The girls hastened now, to put those
refreshments before their guest which
the skilful hand of Canondah had pre-
pared during his sleep.
When he had finished his light repast,
Canondali laid him again softly on his
cushion.
And, casting her arm around Rosa,
drew her towards their little room.
But Rosa,as soon as she perceived the
first symptom's of Canondah's sleep,
rose softly from her couch, and stole
through the curtain to the feet-of her
white brother.
CHAPTER V.
The Indian Maiden and the Stranger.
The extraordinary skill which the
Indians possess in curing flesh wounds
and fevers, appeared strikingly in our
youth when he awoke next morning.
He felt himself sufficiently strong to.rise
into a sitting posture. While doing so,
the two girls entered.
'Good morning, my sister," said he,
with a voice still faint.
The compliment was returned in si-
lence.
The Indian glanced at him, as if to
inquire into the state of his health, and
stepped close before him.
"My white brother," said she, after a
pause. "is come in the canoe of the great
chief of the Salt Lake-has he lived in
bis wigwam, and smoked the pipe of
peace with him'
The meaning of the Indian, though
expressed in her figurative style, and
broken, guttural English, could not be
mistaken.
"Chief of the Salt Lake! You do not
mean the pirate of Barataria ?"
He did not pronounce the last word,
but looked at the Indian, whose eye was
rivetted on him with a calm, scrutinising
expression. .

"Where am I?" exclaimed he now, in
a tone whose hollow sound betrayed the
fearful agitation of his mind.
"Fear nothing, my brother," lisped
Rosa, whose tender heart could not bear
the struggle fhat manifested itself on
the face of the youth. "The daughter
of the miko has extended her hand in
friendship-my brother is safe !"
There was a tenderness in the tone of
her voice,.a delicacy in her movements
as she crossed her beautiful hands be-
fore her bosom, that chased away the
clouds from his brow.
As the youth looked up to the lovely
beig who thus encouraged him, the ex-
pressioi of his countenance changed into
that of surprise-till' his eye became,
to use an Indian term, "wide open with
wonder and admiration."
But the fierce little Indian left him no
time'for admiration-she seemed to have
laid aside all her softer feelings.
"My brother is very young,"-resumed
she, "to go on the war-path against the
great chief of the Salt Lake. He must
first learn to hunt the deer and buffalo,
and to strike the big water-serpent, be-
fore he fights his enemies, or the girls of
of his people will weep over their fallen
brother."
There was an air of pity, mingled
with contempt, that raised a transient
blush on his cheek. He glanced at the
speaker, as if to inquire into the rela-
tion in which she stood with the dread-
ed pirate ; but her calm, immovable
features 'gave no clue to any conclu--
sion.
"And why do you suppose your bro-
ther," said he, adopting the saine ap-
pellation, "has been on the war-path
against the great chief, as you call the
pirate P"
"Look !" returned the Indian ; "when
the red men go on the war-path against
their enemies, they strike the warriors
and chiefs of their foes-'either dead on
the spot, or they catch them, to show
them to their young men and their girls;
but then they watch them, that, they
may not run away from them. But my
young white brother is none of the war-
riors or chiefs-his hands are very ten-
der, and have never raised a tomahawk.
The great chief has caught him with
the boys and girls of his people, and
sent him to his village. The chief of
the Salt Lake is very great, and strikes
men, but he cares not for women or
girls !"
When she had uttered this tauntim

ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE, -

speech, she watched his face keetily, as
if to read the impression. her words had
made.
Rose's eyes were rivetted on the stran-
er, and her countenance betrayed in-
tense anxiety.
The youth, seeming to find gradually
the key to the heart of his fierce little
antagonist, replied-
"Does a great chief strike, people who
have no arms, or does' he rob women,
when.they are' on their 'way to see their
mother?   Only cowards do that -the
brave warriors strike only men 1"
The manner'in which he uttered' these
words raised the interest of the Indian
girl.
"And has my white brother then been
among tQose who went on the war-path
against the chief of the Salt Lake? Ias
he not been caught with his weapons ?
Then he has been caught as a spy,.as, a
scout, for he-speaks with the tongue of
the enemies of the red people, and of the
great chief-or does my brother talk
with a double tongue?"
"You do your -brother injustice," said
the youth, with some embarrassment ;
"he is neither a spy, nor is he on the
wara-path against the great chief. He
was on his way to see his mother. Has
my sister never heard of a great people
beyond the Salt Lakes whose big canoes
cover the sea? See ! your brother is
one of these , people -i he came many
thousand miles across the big lake-he is
from England."
"England !" muttered the Indian girl
whose geographical'knowledge was.rather
limited, as may be supposed-"then my
brother. is none of the people who are
the eneaftes of the red men; and not on
the war-path against the chief- he did
not cone as a'spy ?"
"Certainly not."
The Indian paused thoughtfully.
"My way," continued he, ."lies far ofi
frort that of the pirate, but he crossed
my path, and took us, the friendsof'your
people, prisoners. See, my sister," added
he, after a short pause, "I have escaped
from the strong hold of the pirate, bu
it was not my intention to conic to your
village. A strong wind drove my boa
into the mouth of the lake, from which
ascended the river on which your village~

is situated, not knowing whither I was
going. My waylay towards the mouth
of the Iississippi, to the white people-
I sought them, though they are atwar'
with my own people-yet they -would
have given me a big canoe to return to
my home!".
"The white people," said the Indian,
with fiercenss- "they would have killed
you !"
"No, my sister."
The Indian shook her head incredu-
lously.
"My brother makes a fool of Canon-
dah," she said.
Rosa had stood a silent and attentive
listener.' She -now touched the indian
lightly,.and whispered to her.
"My brother speaks true," said she.;
"he is welcome."
"Where is your father r" demanded
the Englishman-"you are not yet mar-
ried ?"
"The miko is gone with-the warriors to
the hunting grounds, and will not return
these twelve suns," replied the Indian.
The youth's countenance lit up with a
beam of hope"
"And my sister," said he, "will show
her brother the path that leads to the
village of the white people."
"My brother," said the Indian, "is
welcome to the wigwam's of the red peo-
ple, but he must stay till the miko comes
back."
"Till the miko comes back !" repeated
he, crest-fallen.
,   A  pause ensued for some moments.
At last the youth said-
"Has my child ever known a sister of
hers to whom 'she was attached with all
her heart ?"
The Indian glanced at him, and then
threw  both her arms round the neck of
Rosa, and pressed half a dozen kisses on
her lips.
f "How would' she like to lose her sis-
ter?" said the youth, touched by the deep
affection of the Indian girl.
"Canondah could not live wi'.hout the
l White Rose.'
t   "And if the White Rose should be
r torn from her side, would she not try
t every means to save her V'
I "Canondah would give her life for the
eWhite Rose !"

ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.

"Look !" said the youth-"in the ves-
sel in which I came, was my sister with
four of our servants. She is as kind as
you are, and almost as fair as your sis-
ter.  We were going to she our mother,
when the pirate took our vessel and led
us into captivity. I escaped 'to save my
sister, either with the assistance of the
w      people who are our enemies, or go
t the e   try of my own people, and
to re iz v th a big armed canoe to res-
cue her rot 1 the ,hands-of the pirate.
So, 'my good sister," added he, "I have
not a day to lose--every moment brings
dangers."
"Your sister," demanded the Indian,
with a gleam of joy in her countenance,
"is in tie hands of the chief of the Salt
Lake, and he keeps her in his wigwam V"
"You may believe me."
"And how many suns is it since the
sister of my brother has been in the wig-
wam of the chief of the Salt Lake?"
"Twenty-one days."
"The presents which the chief has sent
here," said she, turning to Rosa," are butch
'uurteen suns old 1"
Rosa replied in the aflirmativo.
"And does the chief of the Salt Lake
want two women, when the great miko
of the Oconees had never more than
one ." said she with an air of hero and
deep scorn; which, however, changed
suddenly, as she clasped Rosa in her
arms; "the White Rose,' exclaimed she,
"must weep r.o more-the miko will re-
turn the presents-he will not suffer the
White Rose to be carried away by the
chief of the Salt Lake."
"And my good sister," resumed the
youth, "will not clear the path of her
brother, whom she had received so gene-
rously into her wigwam ?"
"My brother is welcome," returned
the Indian, and he shall have, plenty of
everything, but he must stay till the
miko returns. If the great chief has
taken his sister, and keeps. her in his wig-
wam, he will make her his wife, and she
will be the wife of a great warrior." -
iHaving thus, as she conceived, given
to her guest the last consolation, she wasI
going to leave the room, whea Rosa ar-
rested her once more.                1
"And does my sister think, that whom
Rosa abhors, the sister of my white brk-t

ther will love? Aii will she not help
a sister ?"'
"And the miko, when he returns from
the hunting 4 grounds, and finds that the
young man is gone ?"
"Canondah must tell that Rosa has
cleared his path," whispered she, with a
downcast look.
"And Rosa ?" interrupted the Indian,
darting an impatient glance at her, "Go!
Canondah would rather die !",
The youth looked after the girls, as
they now glided through the door, like
one spell-bound.     -,
At the well-meant consolation of Ca--
nondah, indeed, a sneer passed over his
countenance; but remembering how very
different the ideas of an Indian must-ne-
cessarily be from his own, he composed
himself.
Though they had uttered the latter
words in the Indian language, yet the
attitude of resignation,'the humble mien
with which Rosa folded her hands upon
her bosom, and the horror of the Indian,.
gave him partly a clue to what had just
passed between them.
"But who is this being, so strange, so
tender, and yet so beautiful, who is step-
ping like a mediating angel between me
and this haughty savage ?" demanded he
of himself. "11,w came she among these
Indians? Surely she has been carried
off by the pirate ? And how eano she
by her dress? the latest fashion !"
But then she spoke the Indian language
fluently.:
The more these mysteries weighed on
his mind, the more confused his ideas-
became; but he was still more embar-
iasied by the novelty of his situation,
and the persons by whom  he was sur-
rounded.        -
There was in the situation of the youth,
helpless and melancholy as it Was, somr-
thi g extremely roman tic.
Captured,-as we have seen hin to be,
by the Pirate-of Barataria, on his passage
to one of the Western Islands, h found
himself, after a solitary confluement, and
a still drearier exposure on' the Gulf of
Mexico, suddenly thrown among Indians,
and near one of the most beautiful beings
his eyes had ever beheld.
The very romantic and daring impulse
that prompted him to escape in a stormy

night from the strong hold of the pirate,
. in hope of reaching thy month of the
ississippi, and thus perhaps liberating_
a dear sister, wrought within him a ten-
der interest in the beautiful andsinnocent,
Rosa,.
Asolitary confinement in a cottage,
with no other object before his eyes than
a fascinating maiden, placed in strong
relief by a fine little Indian figure, could
not but excite those romantic sentiments
which slumber in the heart of every
warm feeling youth.
But there was also something which.
y eened to contend powerful against
the soft sentiments which began to creep
into his bosom.
Rosa's surpassing beauty had excited
his deep interest, but prudence seemed
to repress his feelings. His heart lay in
his eye, but his tongue was governed b
cooler reason. And a reserve began to
come over him, that tended to make the
life of the three inhabitants of the cottage
painful.
The two gils seemed to grow more
reserved in the same proportion. They
had not since the first interview spoken_
a single word,. They were stillatten.tive
to him, and even more so than before,.
but preserved:an unbroken silence in his.
presence.
The Indian girl, regularly performed;
the task of a rsurgeon; while Rosa gave
him his meals. On these occasions her
hand vWould tremble-indeed, a shy and
furtive glance would steal on him, as he
took the cup, and her eye would sink on
the , floor with a timid expression-her
bosem would heave, and a crimson blush
would mantle over her cheek and neck-
but just when he was going to break the
silence with a soft, condescending case,,
to which he had schooled and -studied
himself through hours before, the name-
less grace which pervaded "her move-
ments, and .her mild dignity tied his
tongue, and made him look with a deep
confusion which did not escape the fair
maiden.
There was something singular in this.
It seemed as if the delicate being looked
up to himewith awe, but still with a true
' nobleness, which inspired him with a
entitment not unlike that with which a

pious-catholic looks upon his favorite
saint,
It was the visible power which pure,
uncontaminated innoence exercises, with
undisputed sway, over those who come
within its enchanting influence,
HAP TER      V.
The Night Dance.
nIt ewas the night of the fourth day
sihce the  n man had become an in-
mate of the cottage. ie felt his strength
almost returned. 'he healing balsam
had effected wonders, and already cica-
trized the wound, so as to make -banda-
ges superfluous.
He had slept for a couple of hQurs,
when a light rushing noise on the mat
awakened him.
lHe looked around, and caught the dim
shadow  of . a figure that disappeared
through the door. At the same time
long, and loud flashes of a glaring light
itlumimed the room.
The young man sprang up.  ,
"The village is on fire !" exclaimed he,
rushing towards th door.
"D p't be alarmed, said the soft voice
of Rosa, who opened the door, and stood
on the threshold-"our girls and women.
are performing the night dance!"
SThe mournful tones of musical instru-
ments were now heard.
"N ight-dance !" repeated th youtb-
"Am I allowed to see it ?"
. "The night is very cold and damp; my
brothermust not walk in the dark night,
or he will catch the fever again; but,"
added she, after a pause, "'my brother
may see the girls dancing from the avin-
dow of ,Ross's 1-dom."
So saying, she tendered him h r hand,
and led ,hi!n through the partition-cur-
tains into her apartment,.
'This, room' was lighted with. a: small
window,that looked out On the bank of
the stream.
A scene here presented itself of the
most citing description.
Roundthe cove a group of more than
a hundred squaws, girls and boys was

ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.

assembled in a wide circle, each of 'them
holding in one hand a burning pine torch,
in the other a bell.
Four of the company occupied a sepa-
rate place in the circle, and played on
Indian drums and Indian flutes.
The sounds elicited from these instru-
ments were at first very faint, slow and
deadened-but they rose by degrees, and
quickened, as if to rouse the passions of
the dancers.
When they had changed into a double
strophe, the light and graceful form of
Canondah was seen rising and entering
the circle.
Her dance was singular. At first she
glided, orrather wound, itself round the
sitting copper figures with serpentine
quickness-then she assumed a perpen-
dicular attitude, her feet moved close
together, and she scarcely lifted them,
but kept time to the thumping of the
drum by raising her heels, and turning
her feet in the same direction. Her
gestures were strong, chaste and very
graceful. When she had danced for some
minutes, she at length wheeled round,
and took her seat.
The blaze of more that a hundred
torches glared in all directions, and were
reflected from the wide mirror of the
stream-the copper figures, resembling,
vith their blazing brands, so many fierce
demons-the old squaws, with their dis-.
hevelled, glossy hair floating round their
withered necks and shoulders -their
ungainly, threatening gambols-and the
sombre, melancholy sound of the Indian
flute, that sounded like a death-knell,
gave to the sight an inexpressible look
of fierce and demoniacal revelry.
On a sudden the torches were blown
out, and the whole scene was involved
in darkness.
The stranger felt a cold shudder now
creep over him as he stood at the little
window. He involuntarily drew nearer
the maiden, and seized her hand.
"It is a frightful sight indeed," said
he ; "and, Rosa, how could she live with
such beingsV"
"0, they have been very kind to Rosa
indeed, but-"
" But, " resumed he, " you have been
carried oft by the pirate --"

"0, he will do it !" was her reply,
covering her face with her other hand,
and weeping.
There is nothing more calculated to
awaken sympathy than to see a tender
and innocent being in danger-it aroused
all our energies.
"Never !" exclaimed he, forgetting his
own helpless situation in the danger of
the beautiful being-"Arthur will protect
you!"
"Arthur !" she repeated, musing.
It was as if his name had brought him
still nearer to her heart !
She drew  nearer to him-her )hand'
trembled in his-its soft 'palpitation now
thrilled, like electricity, through his very
veins ! The moon shed its silvery light
through the window.
"My brother," said a voice behind
them,- "must whisper softly into the ear
of the White Rose, for she is very tender
-look! she has brought him wine and
a blanket into the hollow tree, and she
watched by him when he was sleeping,
-the roses have almost gone from her
face!"
"Rose !" exclaimed the youth, who
remembered now the light noise which
he had sometimes heard in his broken
slumbers, "you did not do that ? Ho
do I deserve so much kindness and favor
- from you ?"
"But, Canondah ." said the maiden,
with reproach.,
Canondah, however, was gone-she
had stolen through the folds as silently
as she had.glided in'
"My sweet, beautiful Rosa!" exclaimed
the youth, overpowered, clasping her to
his bosom.
She suffered the embrace with yielding
tenderness.
His lips sought hers-they touched-
their breath mingled-it was a delicious
moment!
"My brother," lisped Rosa, with a
tremulous voice, and still clasped it -his
embrace, "see, the cheek of your sister
burns  very   much, and   her bosom
threatens to burst ; and"-her soft voice
fell into a mild, beseeching tone-" ny
brother must not stay longer where Rosa
sleeps-nor must ha come when his sister
sleeps. Ah I" added she, and her voice

melted almost in silver tones, "the wise
man, and he who died on the cross for
,our' sin's, would be, very angry at his
sister."
"And' who is' the wise man t" inquired
the youth.
"He who has taught Rosa, in the cabin
of the trader,"1
The youth paused a moment, ,i a
paroxysm of love and admiration-then,
as i seized by holy awe, he caught her
once more in his arms, raised her, and
laying her softly down on the couch, he
pressed a long kiss on her Izpsb
"No, dear one! Fear npt! None
but a wretch, could beguile so heavenly a
being into sin! Sleep sweetly, and in
peace. Another will watch for you;"
So saying, he agakJ pressed a kiss on
her lips, and fled from the room.
"Arthur !" repeated she-"good night,
Arthur"
He caught the sounds a he hastened
towards his rooms His bosom burned
with inexpressible passion.' A' storm
had risen in his heart that threatened to
consume him.
"If ever," prayed he, "my fate shall
be linked with that of a human being,

let it be Rosa !"
When Arthur awoke the next morning
the scenes of the last night floated before
his imagination like so many.dteams.
It was a bright and lovely morning. In
a field, a group of Indian girls' were ga-
thering corn,               -   ,.
Arthur proceeded through the avenue,
-looking to the right, he beheld Rosa
in a garden.
She had already espied him, and now
dame tripping and blushing towards him.
"And will my brother not see the fme
flowers of his sister'?" said she, raising
her eyes with a tiid' expression  anid,
taking his hand,and drawing him towards
the hedge, his eye rivetted .on her, as if
to satiate himself.
Arthur took the flower, and stood
gazing and 'admiring deeply the'living
. Rose.
Arthur now took her hand-it was the
loveliest little hand 'ever touched by; a
love-sick youth.    /
"And how long has Rosa lived among
these people 'P'

ROSA THE   IAN ' APTW

"We are seven summers on the banks
of this waters"
"4nd where has Rosa been previous
to this time '"
"In the cabin of the white trader many
days from here--beyond the big river!:
"The Mississippi ?"
"Yes)'
"And does Rosa know how she 9amn
to the ti~ader 2"
"see'' said she, in a mysterious tone,
"th people with whe; Rosa lived when
she was very young, told her thatponee,
in  stormy night,,an Indian chief came
into their cabin; and brought them your.
sister, in clothes that werefvery pretty,;
and that she had been found on the road
that lefd4 to the great village on the big
river. That chief was the miko.!"
"Will Rosa show me these clothes "
said he, with an eagerness that betrayed
his deep interest.
"They are now old," said she, "and
very little. , Rosa wore them when she
was not yet a summer old---but she will
show them to you?5
$he tripped now towards the cabins
followed by Arthur, in anxious expecta-
tion.                             a
She opened a drawer in the wall below
the Indian weapons, and took a pack
caref'ully laid by-unfolding it, she then
handed every piece to: the youth. The
ermine pelisse and bonnet were well
preserved. The Brussels lace had beeome
yellow with age-.the cambric and gros
de Naples 'were faded.
Arthur exAmined each piece with great
attention. Near the seam of one of the
little dresses he discovered a cipher, with
the initials " J. d'A.,' and a coronet over
the letters. "Rosa;' said he, and his
mien became : earnest, "these clothes
show that you at e of a .dLittinguishid
family How you fell into the hamds of
the Indian, heaven only knows ; but-."
He paused a moment; for having looked
at the last piece, he noticed a sealed
parcel, with something heavy in it..
"It is the gold chain,"  said Rosa-"but
we must not open it-the .chief has put
it up himself from me. '
She took now the dresses, laid them
again ear  fully by, and put the package

"Rosa, " said the youth, after a pause,
"Arthur loves you very much    more
than he loves himself. Willyou listen
to hin?"
The full glance of love and tenderness
met his eye.
He continued-
"Arthur has a mother, who lives many
days' sail from  the mouth of the big
river. To her Rosa will be welcome.
Arthur is rich, and his friends are very
powerful-they will find out her father
and mother. Will Rosa follow her own
Arthur?''
She listened attentively, but she did
tot enter into his meaning. "But the
miko," said she, timidly, "would not let
Rosa go."
"We must fly !" said the youth.
"Fly !" said she, "and leave Canon-
dab, who has been a sister, a mother to
Rosa?   And. the miko, who has paid
beaver skins for the milk that she drank
in the cabin of the trader ?"
"Ros'," said the youth, in the rnst
touching tones, "do not mistrust me-
have confidence. Arthur will return ten,
fold what the chief has paid to the white
"rthur," said she, "no-- Rosa loves
her brother very much-more than the
light of her eyes-and his voice is much
sweeter than the song of the birds ; but
she-cannot leave those who have been
kind to her "
"Will Rosa stay with Indians; when a
father, a mother, are weeping for her l"
he asked.
"See !" said she, 'the Fathet in hea-
ven has given her the miko a' a father-
lie will not forget His child !"
She now got up to go to her sleeping
room, and he arose to follow her.
The arrangement of the room was
simple. Near the window was a trunk-
the youth cast a glance at him..
"For heaven's sake ! how came this
trunk here ? It is my sister's !" said he
with vehemence.
"Your sister's !' returned she, with
astonishment; "the chief of the Salt
Lake hassentrit to the miko. It contains
the presents which he has sent to your
sister. 0, would I had never seen him!"
She covered her face and grew pale,.

ROiA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.

"Poor Maria !" said he, as he opened
the trunk; which was filled with a variety,
of fashionable female dresses; "and how
long is it since the pirate* has-sent you
these presents ?" demanded he.
"Seventeen days."
"Then he has only robbed her, and she
is still safe !"
But the sight of his sister's wardrobe
cast a glooin over his countenance -his
face darkened, as his eye fell upon Rosa,
who was dressed in one of her robes.
"And, Rosa," said he, bitterly, "wears
the spoils taken from 'my poor sister ?"
His look, his voice, startled the poor -
maiden-it wrung her heart.
She threw a timid glance at him, and
crossing her hands before her bosom, she
said-
"The arrow stics deep in the bosom
of poor Rosa - my brother must not
drive it deeper ! She must wear the
presents of the chief of, the Salt Lake-
the miko has bidden her to do so."
A blush suffused his cheek-he was
ashamed, and reproached himself for hia
rudeness.
"Forgive me, Rosa," said he, throwing
his arm around her-"but my poor sister
is very unhappy !"5
She looked at him  with a tear trem-
bling in her eyes, if to read his counte-
nance.
Canondah entered, and glancing at
them, her countenance seemed to darken
a little, and taking her hand, she led her
towards the trunk.            . .
"Look ! the presents which the chief
has sent are his sister's-he has stolen

"His sister's -!" exclaimed the Indian.

casket, to which hung a small key. He
opened it.
The girls looked with astonishment at
the glittering beads, as they called them
"They are worth beaver skins.! said
Canondah, with a childish stare.
"Many thousands of beaver skins !"
The girls started back in astonishment
and wonder.
From this moment, the fierce little
Indian seemed to have banished every
suspicion, and to have become all tender.

Arthur's lova to the darling of her
heart, and the discovery of his wealth,
had, little as it was'understood.or valued
on her part, removed every doubt as to
his being a scout of the white men.  Â°
"The white youth who .is worth so
many beaver skins," reasoned sbe, "will
not come as a spy into the poor village
of the red men."
Though her demeanor previous to the
discovery had been generous, she seemed
now anxious in the-extreme to show him
attention in a thousand wafs :  .
,,        "My brother must eat," said she-"he
S is hungry, and then will go with Canon-

And, 'without waiting for his reply, she
led the way to the breakfast. When they
had finished the repast, the. Indian girl,
beckoned to him with a knowing smile.
"My brother," said she, when they had
stood on the green before, the. cottage-

Arthurcould not help laughing at the
manner in which the Indian compromised
with her conscience; and following his
generous guide, vho tripped before him
towards the second larger cabin.
"Look here !" said she, with the same
knowing nod; pointing as they entered
the open door, to several boxesthat stood
on the floor -a dressing case among
them. "The pirate has stolen them too

the young.man.
The Indian nodded.

Like many of her more refined sisters,
she took a particular interest in fanning
the flame that burnt but too bright ia the
bosoms of the lovers:
"They are his sister's," returned Rosa,

hands joyfully, when her eye  fl on
Arthur, who had entered. "My brother

roguish look, at Rosa,sand then stole out
of .the room.

emotion that the improved, appearance

The hours that Arthur passed near this

with a voice choked-by her deep emotion.
"Without you?   Never !"
Shall the mother and sister of Arthur
weep over a fallen brother?  In four days
the chief of the Saltlake will be here; he
will follow the trail of my brother, and take
him, if the path be not very wide that lies
between him and the village.
Arthur looked after the maiden as sh.e
drew tow ards the other apartment, and ran
through the room in the wildest agitation.
"Listen, my brother," said the Indian,
with a solemnity which. recalled the young
man somewhat from his trance. "Conon-
dah will do for her brother what will darken
the face of her father and her people, for'
she loves the White Rose very much. She
will show her brother the path that leads
across the swamp, and she will paddle him
over the second river. Will my brother
promise by the Great Spirit, whom his and
yher people call upon, 'that he will not tell
our white enemies where he has. been, and
what his eyes have beheld ?  Will he pro-
misc that he will not show to them the
track that leads to the villages of the red
men ?"
" I will," said the youth, with a firm
voice.
"Then tako these clothes,". said she,
handing him a suit of Indian apparel.
"Those," said she, pointing to his dress,
." would soon be torn to pieces by briers.
I'he print of the moccasin is very soft ; and
in four suns, when our people return, they
will, perhaps, find it no more. Here is red
paint," added she; "or men will follow
you, and it may throw them on a false scent.
Be quick."
The youth slipped mechanically into the
waistcoat of tanned deer-skin, iud even'suf-
fered the maiden to assist him. She tied
the moccasins on his feet, and slung, the
girdle of wampum over him with natural
unconcern, as if she was assisting one of her
own sex. "Here is a blanket," said she,
throwing it round fun. "Here a pouch
with powder and shot; here another, with
wine, cakes, and venison. That gun will
kill water-fowl and deer, and with this my

brother will make fire to roast what he has
killed." She hnng every article upon him
with a cafe that showed how fully she was
conscious of his-helplessness.
When alLthe preparations were finished,
shy slipped again through the curtains, and
Rosa came out once more with a faltering
step.
Arthur cast his arms sound the lovely
maiden. For a long while they were clasp-
ed together in silent, speechlss ariguish.
"Rosa," sa'd he at last, '"I shallleave you,
if youdesire it. I owe you mine,  my sis-
ter's, perhaps my mother's life, and the
happiest hours I ever enjoyed. I1eave you;
butJ shall see you again."
She shook heir head.
"Do not doubt it my dear Rosa ; let it
be the hope that lightens your path. Ar-
thur will come and lead you to a place where
the sun shines on-happier beings."
A minute longer they hung on each oth-
er's lips, when the torch-light was extin-
guished. It was the signal for, their sepa-
ration. Arthur took the lovely helpless
being that lay speechless in his arms, bore
her to her couch, pressed a' last kiss on her
lips, and bade her farewell
The Indian todk his hanad, and led him
from the door. They glided through 'the
avenue, stealing far from the cabins, along
'the hedges and shrubs towards the forest,
with a step so light, as scarcely to touch th
ground. The faint star-light was obscured
by the night-mists, that hung a broad veil
over the village. They now had reached
the sombre forest, illumined only by millions
of fire-fies fluttering about in every direction.
A noise not unlike the murmur of an
approaching multitude struck the English-
man's ear., He hesitated. "We are dis-
covered," whispered he.
"No," said the Indian, "it is the cry of
the. tree-frog and crickets.7
The noise increased fearfully  as they
approached the swamp, where the roaring
of the bullfrog, with the piercing, hollow
bellowing'of an alligator, that was not cuite
torpid, resounded.
"Keep close," said the Indian, after they

had walked nearly an hour. "we are near
the swamp."   Her step now became very
careful; she put her foot forward to try the
ground, retreated again, and tried on another
direction. She then cowered down; and
crawling with her hands on the ground, she
lifted pieces of turf and mud. "We are on
the logs that our men have laid across the
swamps. Hold the'skirt of my gown."
He seized the dress, and they advanced
along the narrow passage.
"Take care," whispered she; "a wrong
step would bury you for ever in the mud."
They passed the dangerous passage in
safety.
"Throw your blanket over your head,"
said the Indian, when they had arrived at
the end of the logs. "The woods on this
side of the swamp are full of briers. Keep
close on my track,' the serpents are very
many, and their sting is deadly. Bow down
you: head, or the thorns will tear your
blanket from you."
"What is that ?" cried the youth, from
whom, as he glided after the Indian, his
blanket was torn vith irresistible force.
His guile stepped back. "It is the big-
brier-my brother hust bow his head,"
disentangling his blanket at the same time
from a-4mge branch studded with thorns of
a hand's length. They arr ived at last on
the banks of the Sabine. Without losing a
moment the Indian sprang to a hollow oak.
"My brother must assist Canondah to shove
the canoeinto the water."
They'carried the light vessel with ease
to the water's edge. A push brought it into
the river; she took the paddles and bade
Arthur sit still.
The sound of the paddles raised thousands
of pelicans, ducks, and wild geese, who,
fluttered about in every direction, striking
our travelers' heads in rather an uncere-
monious manner. The canoe shot across
the river like one Qf its finny inhabitants.
In a few minutes they had reached the
eastern bank.
They landed, and Canondah took the
hand of Arthur.'
" My brother must now open his ears ; he

must not let a word of his sister's talk fall to
the ground. Look, the prairies, on this
side of the water are empty, and the trees
are very few. My brotheri must go up the
bank of this water, till the sun has sunk
behind the trees that grow on the other side,
then he must turn towards where the sun
rises and the wind blows cold. Does my
brother know from whence the cold wind
blovs ?  The trees will show it to him.
The swamps are not so many there. When
my brother copies to a swamp, he will know
how to cheat those who follow his trail."
She paused, as if she expected a question,
but the youth seemed too absorbed in other
thoughts.
"My brother's course," said she, "must
be crooked."
Again she paused, and then said, with a
voice whose soft melodious tone was touch-
ing in the highest degree-
"My brother is now free, and his path
lies open before him. When he comes into
the village of his own people, he may tell
the girls that the daughters of the red men
are not less generous than those of the
white. Let my brother not forget what the
White Rose and t red girl have done to
clear his path. It will perhaps--bury the
tomahawk of their father in their brains,"
whispered she, with a scarcely audible
voice.
" Canondah !" exclaimed the youth, hor-
ror-struck, "'how is this?  What do you
meaxu by it?  Will my flight bring you in
danger ? Never !  [ will return; I will
wait for your father, and face the pirate."
The girl had relinquished his hand, and
glided doen the bank. He ran after her; but
she was already in the canoe, that shot now
swiftly and lightly through the water. A
farewell sounded from the boat as it darted
away under the veiling mist, and soon en -
tirely disappeared. Arthur called her by
her name ; but she gave no answer, He
conjured her to take him into the canoe;
but the light stroke of the paddles was
heard no more-nothing but the shrill notes
of the alarmed water4owls resounded on the
air.

tered and reeled along the street. The words
outgoing, outfight, outrun, were distinctly
beard.  fIalf a doken Goliahs detached
'themselves from the knot, "just to take a
peep at what them there noisy fools whoop-
ed at sp devilishly."
From the dark express swamps which
begin about half a mile from the margin of
the Atchafalaga, a figure had emerged,-
which, from its dress, belonged to the In-
dian race. As the individual advanced with
a wary step wards the town, he had at-
tracted the attention of the two topers, who,
though their hands were giddy with the be-
witching flavor of their' favorite Mononga-
Bela whisky, had no sooner espied the lurk-
.  ing Indian, as they presumed him to-be,
than they gave chase. Swift of foot, the sons
of the west had soon outstripped the Indian,
who seemed in fact too much 'spent long to
escape his nimble pursuers.
Before they had repeated their "Stop l"
the 'Indian was within the grasp of a power-
ful fellow, when a voice, not unlike that of a
roaring bull, bawled'out to him "either to
stop. or he would set his jaw bones aright
in a style."
The poor Indian seemed to comprehend
the language, or the meaning of his pursuers,
and halted; not, however, without putting
himself into an attitude, that indicated his
firm determination to resist to the utmost.
His gunlock ticked, and unsheathing his
knife, he stepped back, facing his antagonist.
The foremost of the two pursuers had left
his pint glass behind the rail fence, that
formed the lane, to have a cordial after his
return, and he was unarmed, if we except.
the dirk that stuck in his girdle: He now
stood before the Indian, whom he exam-
ined with the shrewd glance with- which a
new and rather suspicious object is sure to
he scrutinized, by such as claim the right of
looking into every one's business.
The appearance of an Indian in this quar-
ter was in itself nothing extraordinary, as
scarcely a hundred  miles' further to the
northwest their villages were established,
and their excursions were known frequently
to extend many hundred miles. Their di-

minished number, and above all,. their in-
creasing want, edged by the taste they had
acquired for the irresistible' firewater, had
made them in fact the hunting slaves of the
settlers, who bought for the tenth part of its
real value, whatever game the insatiable
thirst of these wretched victims led them to
procure. There was certainly no other in-
tention en the part of the pursuers than to
have a little fun, and to drink half a pint
of "genuine Monongahela" with the red
skin. At last the man who stood within
the grasp of the Indian, announced his n- -
tention, by swearing he should drink half a
int with him, or he would "put him into
his breeches' pocket."
By this time the second pursuer, on:whom,
repeated draughts lay heavier, had :ap-
proached the Indian, when they took him
between them with that regardless familiar-
ity and assurance-which either.knows of no
resistance, or cares not for it, andconsiders
it a right tp meddle, with undisputed au-
thority,  everything in their own country ;
both advanced:from:the dark shade of the
cypress t ad a the lane, that ran from the
morass owards the river.
"Come, red boy," shouted the second
companion, who, occasionally missing the
narrow trodden path, staggered knee deep
into the mire, while the 'other,' to use his
own expression, "could still stand in his
own shoes." "If ye shan't fight thexa
British, and drink, ay, and drink too;"
By this tithe the rest of the party had
come up, with various degrees of 'swiftness.
There was a sort of jeering curiosity observ-
able in the crowd. Without asking leave,
as may be supposed, they approached the
apparent Indian, examined the. fowling
piece, took a peep at his' scalping knife,
and at his shattered sword, and one even
went so far as to lift the big cap, to get a
deeper insight into the character of theif new,
and as it seemed involuntary visitor. ' There
was something strange in his appearance, it'
must be confessed. A light cap covered
his head to the ears, and carefully concealed
the flaxen curls, but the soft down: of his
youthful beard rendered the conecalnent

in its place a furious panther.

And, so saying, he whistled to a negr
and called for his grey. Taking the saddi
from his hands, he adjusted it himself, an
then said :---
"Well, lad, just mount, and' show on
Senator what fellows both of you are."
"Many thank for your kind assistance,'
said the Englishman, smiling.  ,
S Mr. Graham is perhaps tired ?"said th
senator, who felt that the display of horse
inanship, under present circumstances, was
something like abuse.    -    -    '
The Englishman, however, mounted the
horse to satisfy honest Squire Copeland ;
and, alter some light and easy turns, rode
in full gallop towards the double-barred
fence, and cleared it in the finest style.-.
"Well," said the delighted and 'as-
tonished creole, "I take him. Fix your own
price."
"Well, senator, that there lad," casting a
knowing glance at the'Englishman, "un-
derstands more about horses than you and I
taken together, I warrant ye."
"I beg your pardon, said the Englishman,
who perceived the drift, the rough, but
knowing old man, was going to take. "I
amp only a trifler ; besides, my notions are
genuine English, and would scarcely apply
to this country."
"Well, and what would ineh a slick nag
as that there fetch in England ?"
The senator threw an encouraging glance
at Arthur.{
"A hundred pounds sterling." -
"That is, four hundred and fifty dollars,
ar thereabouts.  Well,;that is too much ;
but half will do."
"A bargain !" exclaimed the enraptured
squire-" five dollars more than I expected,
they'll just do for a morning treat to my
company. But I want money to appear
somewhat decently down the river, at the
heid of my riflemen. And 'now, lad," added.
he, in the same tone-":walk, just up
through that there gate; I know you won't
run away, end if you do--you won'tjrun
"But, squire; you must not speak in this
mnner to the gentleman,"said the senator,

o, when the young. man had disappeared be-
e hind the fig trees. "He is of one of the best
d families, and connected with one of the
commanders of the British forces." '
r    "A fig for their good and best families,"
returned the old inan, whose head.began to
" turt a little from:his copious libations at
dinner. ; "Them best families are the very
e nobility'and the aristocracy. Ain't we free?
Ain't our principles free,? Ain't we sprung
from as genewine a stock of old continenta-
lers as the best o  em?  What do we care
about them Eng sh ?"
"But you w   ld not insult a guest of 1y
house, and a stressed young man."
"Certainly not," said the squire, whose
heat was only momentary. # "And I am
just come to talk about that there lad."
" Well, to tell you my opinion plainly,
you have done a foolish thing that may
cost the noble youth his life.",
"Ay, ay, I was afraid of that."
"Well, and why did you dismiss the ac-
tion?  A man of your round nmus might
have seen that the British would not send
youths as emissaries, with scarcely a beard
on their chin."
"Ay, ay, true-I mought have done so,
but for that babe of mischief Dick Gloom.
He stuck and hung about me like a wasp.
At any rate, senator, you must not let F'
go down ; he would make u trouble-you
understand me ."
"I  do-there you have brought a fellow
into my house who rages, like the yellow
fever, over my peaceful dominion ' But the
day before yesterday ho beat one of nlyne-
groes, that I almost despair'of his:.being
again good for anything-you may count
each of the-thirty-nins lashes on his back."
"But them negroes are such beastly cre-
turs," said the squire, wh&amp; again=thought it
his duty to take the part of-his countryman
against a negro. "And the lad is honest."
"Yes," said the senator, drily, "for-the
last Tennessee which he ordered, I had to
pay just twice as much as for that which I
brought from the city."
~"Now look, the lad has bought a parcel

)

of land in our county, and you know he
wants to pay for it."
"Yes, with my money-the sooner he
better. I will gladly contribute my share
to get rid o'f him."
And I hope you'll part friends, though
few like him; yet he has many ma'dcaps on
his side, and I don't trust him at all."'
"And still you will give him your daugh-
ter? You Georgians are strange people.
Youhang together like a nest of hornets;
touch one and all the rest are on your heels.
And the poor Frenchers, as you call them,
have to pay f'or it. But come," added he,
good-humoredly, "I presume you retired,
and have slept but little last night-we will
y a       take supper, and then both of you may take
your rest."
The party assembled again in the dining-
room for sapper.' The family drank Bur-
gundy diluted with water ; the squire and
Dick Gloom took tea ; but little was spoken:
and the company soon broke up. Arthur
retired to his room. When the servant left
him, he paced for an 'hour up and down his
apartment, and was just going to lie down,
when a heavy, slow step, that .shook 'the
very staircase that led to his apartment,
made him pause. The door opened, and a
tall, large man entered without further cer-
emony. It was the overseer, Mr. Richard
Gloom.
"Sir," said the young man, and the fire
of indignation flashed from  his eye, "I
presume there will be sufficient time to-
morrow to choose your visiting hours."  '
"Ay, boy," returned the visitor, with a
fw taunting laugh, "still afloat? I thought
thee hushed!"-
"What is your demand ?" asked the
youth, half choked with rage.
.: "I reckon.a prisoner and a spy hasn't nq
right to ask after honest men's business,"
replied he, with. a dry. malignity, turning
his back on him at the same time, and
throwing his linsey coat on the chair.,
"What does that mean, sir? Aie you
sent by Mr. Gentillor? ' exclaimed he, with
a voice of rage. The thought struck him
perhaps unnecessary precaution on the

part of the Creole had brought about this
intrusion.Y                        ?
"Vr. Gentillon'!" said the fello~wwitlr a
sneer, hanging at the same time hiswaist-
coat quietly on the 'chair.  "He is a
Frencher, and cuss" ie, if I''trist these
Frenchers; they are  'rascally slyaset,{and
rust be attended to. No, it are myself
who wishes so much to see'thee hanged.
Worm thee just a bit further, as thou hast
formed thyself through the Indians. It
are sheer foresight."
"You shall not, sleep here !" thundered
the youth.'
" Thinkest thou so, boy 7" retorted his
enemy, with the same wild taunting laugh.
"Dick Gloom 'never turns his back to a
fight ; but take care of thy jaW-bones, ay,
and *f thy eyes, too."
So saying, he threw his 'huge form 'down
with a forcethat hook these whole manSion.
Arthur sprang up and ran through theroofm
half distracted with rage. The cold malig-
nity of the 'fellow had so exasperated him
that he trembled ; he was no longer master
of himself. He looked round the room for
some weapon. But the felw lay  uietly
grinning ou the bed, without uttering a sin-
gle word. Gradually the young man re-
turned 'to his senses. Throwing himself into
a chair, he laid .his head on the table, try-
ing to take his rest in 'this uncomfortablM
posture. le fellow lay for about a 4tlater
of an hour motionless.
"Now, boy, choosest thou the cool chair,
instead of the soft warm bed ?-maybe tho
wouldst lik  a better beddellow -!-mayhap

settlements, had excited' the curiosity of the
planter.
"From what I have seen of these sav-
ages," said the older young lady, who had
already ten times opened her mouth and
shut it again, in consequence of a serious
glance from her father, "I am really not
over-anxious to behold any more specimens
of these people; but we are so lonesome
here--ah! so lonesome," added she, nearly
yawning, "that I would give something to
know how they look. A female, you say,
papa, was among them?   Probably, one of
them-how do you call them ?"
"Squaws," replied the senator.
" Squ-squaws !" repeated she, opening
her pretty lips with a grimace, as-if she was
afraid the uncouth word would hurt them,
and showing a row of ivory teeth in so droll
a manner, that the company could not help
laughing aloud, and even Arthur,who seemed
to be buried in thought, woke from his
reverie.
Melisante thing !" said the father,
threat uing her with his finger.
"Now, papa," said the sprightly girl, in
a half-laughing. half-whining tone, " how
unjust you are ! Here we are sitting and
sighing, not unlike the two princes of the
Arabian Tales, surrotuded by black vis-
ages, and watched by the agreeable Mr.
Dick Gloom-nd Charles is away, and you
are going."
"And Mr. Hugh M'Leaven," added the
father. in the same mocking tone.
" P pa !" said the blushing girl, putting
her pL'y finger to her mouth. ' But do

father. imitating her tone, " unless you
choose :o work on' the lines."
" Ta, I will !" exclaimed she ; "the

more   :triotic and republican than we are
--I u.1 at least carry provisions for the
worki eu."
" A Irast for one of their commanders,"
&amp;aid ti~e father.

' But, papa, how you delight to torment
us ! Pray, shall we really have no balls
this year ?"
"I am afraid but too many !"
"And why leave us at home?"      She
now caught the meaning of her father.
"Oh! those terrible--" but, recollecting
herself, she changed them into "the terrible
war!"
" Eleanor!" exclaimed both father and
mother, with a mild reproach.
"But why so deep in thought, Mr. Gra-
haq ?" demanded the former-
"I was just thinking how many a one-
some mother and sister will count every
minute with an aching. heart, that may
bring them dreadful tidings. Miss Eleanor
is quite right in calling the war and its au-
thors terrible."'
The gay volubility of Eleanor had now
received a sort of indirect check. She gazed
for a moment; with a tender and full glance,
at the youth, and then said, " Mr. Graham,.
we too ljave a brother down the river-
But reall , papa," resumed she, turning
again to h r father, though with quite an-
other air, " if Charles, now -''
"Or M'Leaven," added the senator.' The
girl again blushed deeply.
"If you do not cease tormenting me,
papa, I shall not open my mouth again for
the whole eveiing."
"For which silence, perhaps, we shall feel
very much obliged," returned the father.
I am free to protest," subjoined Arthur,
"it would be a loss indeed."
" WEll, now, if Charles should receive

hanging with an interesting and droll e:

" Oh ! take us with you, papa. Come,

Both girls now tripped before their father,
and raising their delicate hands, they begged
- Oh!I take us with you!'

,OSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.

The delighted father looked for a while
at the blooming girls. "It cannot be,"
said he. "In case now the enemy should
take the city ?"
"Then they would certainly respect the
fair se' as they have dose everywhere else-
I pledge my honor for that," said the Eng-
lishman, who felt himself called upon to
protect the gallantry of his .countrymen.
fA grateful glance from the charming pe-
titioners was his reward.
"And what do you say, madam ?" de-
manded the planter, now turning towards
Mrs. Gentillon, who at all the while a si-
lent and passive auditor.
"Whatever you decide upon, dear Gen-
tillon, will be agreeable to me."
"Well !" said the yielding father-"-I
am myself of opinion, it will be the best..
We will go down together, that is, if I can
bring Mr. lick to stay here."
But the latter words were not heard by
the delighted girls. Both fell upon the
neck of their father ; kissed himand mamma
a dozen times; and Eleanor ran out of the
room to make preparations for the journey.j
Gabriella lingered in the room-from time
to time her glance stole from behind the
silken lashes of her. beautiful languishing
eye, upon the youth
" I am afraid," said he, "I have spoken
against the interest of my country. The
Americans will be invincible, if they know
_what treasures they are going to defend, and
what soothing hands they have to expect."
"Really, my country will' want such a
stimulus," said the representative, " and
with all that, I an afraid our resistance may'
prove ineffectual. The odds are too great,"
said the senator, stepping at the same time
between his guest and his daughter. The1
latter left the room. Arthur paused, and
seemed lost in rev'rie. Yes,". repeated the
senator ; the odds are too great-fourteen
thousand against three."
"Only three thousand soldiers !" said
the astonished youth.
"Oh ! no," subjoined the planter, who
began to be aware that he had spoken,
rather too freely respecting the state of de'-

fence. "There will be some thousands
more, but still I am afraid we shall have to
relyon the generosity of our enemies."
"Mr. Gentillon and his countrymen will
certainly not be disappointed; and my coun-
trymen ought to feel proud to become the
protectors of so generous a people."
"Oh. as for that, I have every hope.
Our commanding general is a man of energy
and military e perience."
"Has'he fought in any battles ?"
"Chiefly against the Indians-he in the
terror of the'savages."
"'Indians-?" repeated the Englishman, in
a tone that, notwithstanding his efforts,
could not entirely suppress a slight sneer.
."Yes,"' said the senator, a little dryly-
" the-Indian wars are the school of our of-
ficers and soldiers, as the East:Indian wars
are the preparatory exercises for your coin-
manders, and even of your hero of Vittoria."
Their conversation was interrupted by the
heavy steps of the overseer, which were
heard in- the corridor.  Both gentlemen
went into'the saloon ; where they found Mr.
Dick Gloom, 'just filling a tumbler with
rum, and diluting it with a few drops of
water-he swallowed the draught compos-
edly, without paying any attention to the
gentlemen.
"I thought you would not return to din.

tone, without looking ups /
Arthur had stepped up to the window.

the planter.
"Have I? ay, so I have, and so plainly
that I could. fiad theta out among thous-

Arthur became' more attentive.
"Can't sry, not I, what sort of red skins

added he, smnacking his lips, "Oh geminiQ

CHAPTER XXIV.
"During our morning walk, anofficial ac-
count arrived, which will tend to heighten
the exasperation against your countrymen ;
. mean the destruction of our boats.
The countenance of the Englishman
brightened ; 'the senator had touched a
point which struck his English nerves too
powerfully.
The desire of hearing something more of
the affair was clearly legible inthis eounte~
nafee.
"It could not be otherwise. expected,"
conthmued the senator; "your superiority in
numbers was too great."
"Mr. Gentillon will allow me to think,
that even had it been less, the result would
have been the same."
"And Mr. Graham will allow me," re-

turned the senator, "to doubs his patriotic'
assertion-and with good ground. The ac-
tions on Lakes Erie and Champlain, and
the repeated captures of your frigates, are
 sufficient proofs that my fellow citizens
know how to fight, and to conquer, where
the odds are not too great."
"But Mr. Genfillon willgnot adduce those
trifles as proofs of your naval superiority.
s6'We must leave naval superiority for the
present to those who enjoy it; at least, it
would be ridiculous to enter the lists with
our f evfrigates and sloops, against the
greatest maritiine power of the present times ;
but even from these defeats, which you call
trifles, but which I consider in quite'another-
light, and really as preludes to future great
battles, you may see what the Americans
can do, and'what they will do, when they
have a maritime power-and this they must
have in less than twenty years."~
"6My countrymen will feel very much
obliged to Mr. Gentillon," returned the Eng-
lishman,- "if he allows them  fifty years.
Butin this time the United States may per-
haps have ceased to exist. The elements of
which they are composed are of too discord-
ant a nature to promise a long and a firm
continuance."

pie in the world. With a sound understand-.
'ng, you give yourself the worst airs. A
Frenchman pillages the country, and plun-
ders the inhabitants ; but he does it with
something like grape, and though his rapa-
ciousness'is execrated, it is soon forgotten,
from his politeness. You Englishmen are
too proud to take where. you can give; and
if you spend your money in the conquered
province, yet you do it with .a sneer ; and
while you, in fact,, benefit the country, you
destroy-the favorable impression by the air
of contempt which accompanies your gen-
erosity. You are the fathers and the found-
ers of this country, and yet speak of an
enemy, and the idea of aft Englishman is
connected with it.  Mr. Telemaque will
think his mentor a little inclined to be tire-i
some, bnt Mr. Graham may be assured that
it is only sincere regard that prompts its
conversation. I hoped to chase away-the
melancholy cloud from the brow of my young
friend, that might otherwise have settled
there, and rendered his stay at my house
still more disagreeable. If I have'trespass-
ed, I beg Mr. Graham's pardon."
The Englishman pressed the hand of the
Creole warmly. "I feel," said he, "what
I owe to Mr. Gentillon, and I can pnly give
the assurance that I shall not think, even
the hard trials which I am going to encoun-9
ter, too dearly bought by the interesting
light which he has thrown on many sub-
jects entirely strange to me."
He was going to say more, but the over-
-seer strode in, announcing that the steam-
boat which was to take them: to the city
would be down in a few hours.
The man scratched his head once or
twice, and was again slowly retreating to-
wards the door, when the senator suddenly
demanded, "How many bales may be in
the cotton gin 7"
"About fifty."
"And on the boards ?"
"Fifty more ; and in the field perhaps a

sent to you-it must be pressed before my
return."
"Well, senator," said the overseer, "I
haven't no notion of staying here, when my
people are going down to fight the British-
ers; I mean to go down myself."
"As you please," returned the senator.
"Make out your accounts, and deliver them,
and you are ffee to go-I dispense even with
the usual warning, though it was stipulated.
If you choose to go down with the steam-
boat, you can do so ; and the accounts will
be settled by my lawyer."
The determined, cool tone of the planter
seemed to make a deep impression on Mr.
Dick Gloom. He stood for a moment,
struggling between his desire of going down
and fighting the Britishers, and seeing per-
haps his malignant hatred gratified against
one of them ; and the loss which he, must
sustain, if dismissed from his service. The
mention, however, of the lawyer was deci-
sive. Scratching his head once more, lie
marched off, muttering, "I'll stay."
"One thing we have gained. We are
rid of that fellow, who might have made our
passage very disagreeable, and caused us
even some trouble in the 9ity. We must
now prepare for the joyrney. Your par-
don," said he, bowing slightly, and leaving
the saloon.
Arthur went up into his room. He had,
notwithstanding the extreme politeness of
the planter, and his anxiety to conceal em-
erything, observed that his efforts had be-
come rather studied. He had remarked the
solicitude with whigh.he had cut short his
conversation with Gabriella. There was a
polite but obvious repulse in the manner of
the senator. His situation began to grow
painful to him; his heart almost sickened
with suspense, fear and dreadful anticipa-
tion. He opened the window. The ser-
vants were gaily bustling up and down stairs
-4heir merriness fell heavily on him. He
shut the window. The sun was setting,
and his broad streaks on the Mississippi
announced the close of the day. At last the

hissing sounds of the steam-boat were heard
-a few minutes more, and the vast machine'
rolled before his eyes,Tand turned, and moved
slowly towards the bank. The deck of the
vessel was filled with a medley of armed
men, whose tremendous 4houts announced
the riflemen of Opelousas. She had now
come to-and Squire Copeland, with four
men, armed with rifles, marched towards
the mansion. -They halted on the piazza,
and squire Copeland entered. There is
something appalling in a military display of
this character. Arthur grew pale-and a
slight shudder flew over him. But a mo-
ment's reflection gave him firmness, and he
descended with a quick step.-   .
"Au, lad !" exclaimed tie new  captain,
shaking him heartily by the hand, "there
you are, all's right-I hope it may end well
-shouldn't like to see thee hanged."  And
so sayingrhe stepped, with all the military
pride he could muster, into the parlor,
where the planter and his family were just
entering from the side door.
"A good evening to all ofdye-i see you
are in your gears. You h tin't no notion,
senator, to take them tender creatures down
with ye-do ye? Hang me, it ain't no joke,
nor a husking frolic neither. How now,
young folks, d'ye really mean to run your
chances with us? Ay, and all ready from
top to bottom ! No, I warrant ye, there will
be fine doings."
He would -have probably continued for
half an hour longer, if the senator, who had
been unusually serious all this time, had not
interrupted him. by saying, "They will go
down with me."
"Well, well, all's right ; I hain't no ob-
jection. But," and he turned now with a-.
military air towards the senator, "I have to
thank you, senator, for the care you have
taken of the prisoner-your trouble-shall be
duly paid in country bills; one dollar and
seventy-five cents for one day and a half,
maybe a few hours more--according to law.
But, I am now to reclaim the prisoner, at
your hands, that he may pass into military
jurisdiction, according to law."
"Well, as I am going down myself, cap-

tin,.you will have no objection, if I take
care of the proper lodging of Mr. Graham.
Where is the captain of the steamboat"
lHe had just entered the house. The sen-
ator spoke a few words with him apart, arnd
the boat's new company having taken theF
customary refreshments, they proceeded on
board the steam-boat.
CHAPITE XXV,
'a Fellow citizen !" said the senator, when
.the party had entered the cabin of the
steamboat. "I hope you will pay proper re-
spect to misfortune, even in the person of
an enemy of our country ; from all appear-
ance, we have a gentleman before us-as
such, I wish him to be tre ted ; as senator
of the state which we are all going to de-
fend, I wish him to be so treated. Sir,"
added he, turning to Arthur, "here'is your
state-room."
The sort address hid the desired effect;
the multitude whoeame gazing and peeping
through the cabin door drew off in silence,:
and _the company was soon left alone. It
consisted of the senator and his family, and
about twenty landed proprietors from the
banks of the Mississippi. The senator pre-
served his usual gentleness, and the open
"manner in which he treated the prisoner,
bespoke that he was a 4nan of 'that firm
'character, which neither feared suspicion,
nor shrunk from it. But Arthur himself
felt the necessity of greater reserve, and it
was but seldom that they exchanged words.
After a short supper, the females retiredI
into the ladies' cabin, the gentlemnen in their
small but elegant state-rooms, of six feet
eight, inches in length, and four feet in9
width.  Arthur soon followed their ex-3
ample.
The lamps shed a dim lustre through the
cabin, above which the heavy footsteps ofi
the trampling multitude were heard mingled
' with the regular strokes of the steam engine.'
Arthur, in his berth, felt his hand softly
touched, and a voice 'whispered into his

" To-morrow, at three o'clock, mama
leave dinner, and be in the ladies' cabin."
The mysterious speaker stole through the
silk curtains that 'hung ,down from the
ceiling of the little room, and left Arthur to
his thoughts.
The passage was a dreary one to Arthur;
wherever he turned he beheld cold, scrutiniz-
ing, or desponding glances.  The senator
had become more pensive and dejected every
passing hour; his eyes hung long and de-
spairingly on Arthur. Eleanor had not .
spoken a single word, Gabriella had not left
the ladies' cabin, and betrayed her presence
only by a loud sobbing. There is something
extremely discouraging in these mute work-
ings of pity and sympathy.
The dinner bell rang, and the family sat
down with the rest of the company ; but
none of them tasted the dishes. Gabriella
looked up, from time to time, from her un-
touched plate, and at last, unable longer to
suppress her feelings, she burst into tears,
and left the table. Arthur felt' his right
foot touched, hestarted, and after a moment-
ary recollection, stole behind the curtains of
the sanator's state-foom; a door opened
from the small apartment into the ladies'
cabin--Arthur passed through it, and Barn-
ho stood before him,
"Move towards the curtain,' whispered
the black, "or they'll see the English massa
through the window, It is well, massa has
understood Bambo; but not .yet time. 'Does
massa see yon smoke ?"
Arthur looked in the direction indicated,
"It is the camp of General Coffee, with
his militia men. We must pass them before
massa can leave the boat."
A few minutes brought them in sight of
the eucamped troops, who, however, were
manoeuvring quite differently from the speci-.
mens of soldiers which we have sketched on
a former occasion. The Englishman stood
in silent expectation.
"What does that mean ?" demanded he,
at last.
The negro laid his fingers on his mouth,
and looked at the men. The steam-boat
was now on the point of the great bend that

"Back ." repeated the soldier.
"The chiefs must see their white brother,"
said the old Indian.
The soldier gave no answer, but booked
towards the approaching prisoner.     +
" Tokeah!" said the Englishman, who
stood now before the old Indian, only sepa-
rated by the sentinel. "I have kept my
word of honor ; but I must request you to
release me from it."
At this moment the band opened, and
Rosa flew into the arms of Arthur, the mus-
kets sank from the hands of the iron-hearted
veterans, and they stepped involuntarily
back at the sight of the transcendant and
almost unearthly beauty of the maiden. For
a moment she hung in his arms, speechless,
unconscious of everything around. The com-
manding officer made a sign.
"Sir," said he, "the time is pressing."
"Rosa, I must leave you," whispered
Arthur.
"Leave Rosa!" exclaimed shQ, and the
crimson of her face changed to a deadly
pale.'
"I must go with these gentlemen."
She hung on his arm like a drooping
vine.
" Tokeak !'\ said the youth, still support-
ing the maiden  ith hisarmn, "I have prom-
ised not to tell where I found you and your
tribe. Your Indian dress is near bringing
me to an ignominious death-may I tell how
I caine ito your village, and in possession
of this dress ?"
The Indian listened attentively.
"Sir," interrupted the officer, "that is
against military rules."
"Certainly not," replied the youth, loft-
ily ; "I gave my word of honor ; I reclaim
it only."
"I wish you may give this gentleman
time to explain himself," said the, senator,
who stood with his family behind the offi-
cer.
"Even the high respect'I bear to Mr.
Gentillon would not permit that," returned
the officer. "'What the gentleman has toc
say will be heard by his judges."
"May I speak ?" demanded the English-

man, once more, of the silent and provok-
ingly calm Indian.
The Indian was about to open his lips,
when the soldiers raised their muskets, and
pushing both the chiefs aside, they marched
their prisoner on shore, and soon disappear-
ed among the gaping crowd.
Rosa looked after the youth, who, like a
meteor, had vanished from her sight ; she
drooped her head- then gazing wildly
round, she was going to rush after the be-
loved object, when she felt herself suddenly
withheld. It was the senator, who led her
gently into the cabin,'and made the Indians
a sign to follow him. He had scarcely de-
livered Rosa into the hands of his daughter,
when he addressed himself, trembling with
anxiety, to the old Indian, who stood before
him in all his shrunken grandeur, un-
moved, to every appearance, by what he had
seen.
" Was It you, from whom the young man
obtained the dress and the weapons ?" de-
manded he, with an impatience which was
the surest means of obtaining no reply at
all.
The old chief gazed at the interrogator,
but he gave no answer.
"Perhaps you know something about
it?" demanded the senator, turning to the
young chief.
The same silence.
"Men !" cried the senator, who knew lit-
tle of Indian manners, or of their circuitous
and sententious phraseology, "I must re-
quest you, in all earnestness, to speak plainly;
the life of the young man in whom you seem
to take so deep an interest, depends on your
promptly revealing the manner in which ho
came by his disguised"
He might have spoken an hour without
coming to the point.
" Why has Arthur left Rosa'?" demanded
the latter of her neighbor, the tender Ga-
briella.
"He is led to prison," said Gabriella.
"T Io prison-and why? Has my brother
done wrong ?"
"They suppose so-they think him a spy,
a British emissary, who instigated the In-

dians against the white [people," replied
Gabriella.
The words spy and emissary had attracted
the attention of Tokeab.
 "Is the old man," said he, "to whom the
miko of tho Oconees talks, one of the chiefs
of the white men ?"
The senator nodded.
"Has he fought in many battle ?"
" No-I am not a military chief, but one
of peace," returned the senator, who, when"
he found that his abstract expressions were
riot in the vocabulary of the Indians, en-
deavoredconsequently, though with difficulty,1
to adopt a simpler mode of conveying his
deas to the minds of his auditors.
"Then," said the old Indian, after a pause,
"he is one of the wise nien,-who hold their
talk in the council house."
The senator replied in the affirmative.
" And the wise man cannot deliver my
ypng white brother from the white warriors,
and from the prison ?"
! "No," said the senator, painfully embar-.
rassed at the tedious questioning.
"But the old man," continued the miko,
is wise, and he can clear the path of the
chiefs of the red men, that they may talk
to the great chief of the white warriors."
"Do you wish to speak to the general"
den anded the senator.
"We do," was the brief answer.
"I doubt very much whether the red men
will be admitted. The necessary precautions
do not allow strangers to go down to the
lines, where he is at present; and even if
they go down, they will scarcely find oppor-
tunity of talking with the chief. He is very
busy."
" Tell the great chief and father that the
chiefs of the Oconees and of the Cuman-
chees are come with their hands extended, as

be effected with such men ; and yet the mo-
ments were precious. As the intercourse of
the young Englishman, beyond doubt, had
been with one of the most dangerous ene-
mies of the white population, it wa to be
feared that his case would not even be
thought? worthy of a strict inquiry or tfe
decision of a court martial. According to
the customs of war and'the rules of martial
law, the fate of the worthless adventurer
might be sealed in less than one hour, under
the pending pressure, and where the English
camp was scarcely three miles from the
American lines. Great as his influence was,
he had himself witnessed an example of the
stern justice of the commanding general,
that filled his republican mind with involun-
tagy apprehension. He ran through the
cabin to Rosa. "Will my fair child go with
us ?" demanded he.
She inclined her head.
" Then'come," said he. "I will try my
utmost to bring you before the general.
Come, red men," added he, turning towards
the Indians.
"The wise man," said the miko, "may
show the chiefs the path-they will follow
him."
The party now left the cabin. A carriage
was waiting at some distance from the mar-
gin of the river. The senator made a sign,
and it drew up as the party approached.
"The red rnen will follow- my carriage,".
said he turning once more to the In-
dians.
They nodded their acquiescence. Afoot-
man opened the door, let down the steps, and
the senator handed Rosa in, and took him-

Negroes with spades, gohg to work on th
lhies, picked their way carefully through th
long ranges of wagons and horses which ob
structed their passage.
"It will take up too much time to gi
down ia the carriage," said the senator
" Has my child any objection to a walk ?'
A mild, consenting glance was the an
swer. They alighted, and found the Indians
close at the wheels of the carriage. Beck-
oning them to follow, they now crept in
their turn through the crowd, often in im-
minent danger of being'caught by the wheels,
or trodden under the feet qf the horses. A
weary hour passed before they saw the
mansion of the general. 'Ihe house stood
back from the road, and separated from the
long range of summer mansions of the

with a -ecipitancy which showed his anxi-
ety, he led the way through the avenue to-
wards the mansion, ascended the steps that
led to the piazza, passed the corridor of the
maus.u, and entered a wide s loon.
CHAPTER XXVI.
They found the general; surrounded by
his staff and other leading officers, whom
he was dispatching on various routes, ac-

e a gravity and coolness only to be found in
- a master mind. He was a tall, swarthy, large
boned man, whose weather-beaten 'counte-
o nance bore an appearance of severity by no
means prepossessing to a stranger ; and yet,
when for a moment his iron features relaxed,
- and he turned his bright brown hazel eye
with a calm smile of recognition- on the
senator and his party, as they entered, thpre
was a good humor and benevolent that
immediately radiated those stern features,
which had a happy effect in restoring the
confidence of his visitors. The compliments
of courteous salutation being over, the sen-
ator introduced the two Indian chiefs to the
general, who received them with every de-
mionstration of regard.
"The red men," said Tokeah, throwing
himself into his usual oratorical position,
have brought the great father of the white
people tokens of their friendship. They
have brought him the great chief of the
Saltlake, that he may hang him on a tree."
"Chief of the Saltlake !--what, you do
not mean the pirate !"
"The pirate of Barataria," said the old
man.
"Indeed! well I am  glad of it, though
it is no affair of mine; it belongs rather to
the government of the tate whose territory
he has violated, yet I amn glad, both for the
governor and for the state. How did this
desperate character come into your hands?"
"The great chief of the Cumanchees,"
said the old man, "has caught him when he
burned our wigwams, and carried away the
daughter of Toheah," pointing to Rosa.
The general cast another glance at the
young warrior, and a long pause ensued.
"Do the white warriors," resumed the
miko, "tAke the lives of those who come
into the wigwams of their red friends from
over the saltiake ?"'
"If they are the enemies of our country,
and if they go among the red men to sow
needss in the path that lies between the
white and the red people-certainly."

have found the path without the runner of
the Oconces."
"It is well," said the general.
lIe rang the bell, and an orderly appeared.
Seating himself in his arm-chair, he wrote
a few lines, gave them to the soldier, and
stepped forward, addressing the party in
general, but more particularly the senator.
"The manner in which our enemies have
treated us. instigating and exciting our mis-
guided 'red brethren against the poor settlers
and helpless families in the west of the
Union, certainly justifies severe 'measures
on our -1'rt, against persons suspected of
being cot earned in those dastardly under-
takings. From what I understand, the
Englishman in question does not belong to
this class of wretel es. I hate the enemies
of my co'itry ; but far be it from inc to shed
the blood f an innocent and peaceful travel-
er, whom  toward accident seems to have
thrown on our shores.'
"He is a young man of high standing
and conned Ions, and has been captured by
the pirate, with his sister. Even the man-
ner in wL h he kept his word of honor may
convince you, general, that he is a gentle-
man."
The ge1ral again bowed slightly, and
turned toe ds the young chief, whom he
seemed to  ad through.
"It is I l A, tbn," said he after a while,
"of whom our western newspapers speak
with so n'h admiration, and who saved
the last pa:- sent by our government to
explore t    stern country from a cruel,
treaeherou death. and relieved the young
woman fr,. a rrible death. You see how
aecuratel; a ore informed of your doings."
The y a    Lief bowed, and inclined his
head.
"I sha  ih -py," continued the gene-
ral, " to     i   1tr mine and my country's
guest so a   ,uaished and humane a war-
rior as tih  u If of the Cumanchees-the
most pow '   of the Indian nations in the

Spaniards. 'Their cavalry is a' fine corps.
and they are, I am sure, the best irregular
lancers in the world."
"The Cumanchees know no master ex-
cept the Great Spirit," said the young war-
rior loftily.  "If the heart of the great fa-
ther and warrior of the white people ap-
proves of what the chief of the Cumnanchecs
has done, let him do the same, and give the
white young man to his friends, whose
hearts are very sad."
"Be assured, my brother," returned the
general, "that I shall do what my duty and
humanity demand. If the youth is innocent,
and I have no doubt he is, then he shall be
free. For the present I am pressed with
affairs of importance ; but in one hour -I
hope I shall have done, and then I shall
expect you in the city."
Waving his hand to the Indian, he shook
that of the senator, and the party withdrew.
A sergeant informed them that he was to
conduct the Indians to the lodgiug-assigned
to them by the general, and to take the pi,
rate into safe custody. They now passed
through the pleasure-ground under quite
different feelings. 'The re-echoed roaring
of a twenty-four pounder, from the camp,
struck their ears, just as they arrived at the
gate ; but the Indians passed on. seemingly
without noticing the heavy peal.
"That's from one of them guns," said
the sergeant, pointing to a heavy pieco of
ordnance that stood behind the lines.
They approached them, and looked at-
tentively at the new objects that presented
themselves to their eyes. The lines were
not yet quite finished, but in a state of rapid
progress that promised a speedy termination,
They consisted of a long range of cotton
bales, extending from the margin of the
Mississippi across the bottom towards the
cypress swi np. These were covered with
earth, exhibiting thus an impenetrable
breastwork, behind which the assailants
could be received with the sure and dreadful
fire of the western back-woods riflemen.
Several batteries, parly finished, showed,
heavy pieces of ordnance that were to do

 ing on the sofa, without being able to move
s from the spot.
" My dear Rosa," said he, in a tone thrill-
t ing with emotion, "nothing shall ever more
, separate us."
Every one stepped back, and the family
- looked in silence at the noble couple.
S"ILet us now, dea- friends, forget the past
and live in the present, and acknowledge
thankfully the ways of Providence," said
Madame Gentillon.
"Not a hair shall fall from  our heads'
without He wills it," said Rosa.
iertearful eyes were turned towards heav-
en, and again upon Arthur. The mother
crossed her hands, and a general silence be-
spoke the deep feeling of all.
"I commit," said Arthur, after a pause,
"my Rosa to the hands of the tender Gabri-
ella ; she will not reject so lovely a sister."
.The girl blushed, and received Rosa in
her arms. The senator understood the
meaning of his gueit, and seizing his arm,
both gentlemen walked into the next'room.
"I am so unfortunate," began the Bng-
lishman, "as to give my friends more un-
easiness than even the rules of politeness
will allow."
"Sir," replied the senator, with a hearty
shake of the hand, "do not speak here of

cedes every rule. Pray speak Sri hout the

"It is absolutely necessary for me," said
the Englishman, "to leave the city to-mor-

ator; "I hope the general has not fixed the

"Not exactly ; but still in a manner that
allows of no hesitation. Were even the re-

eumstance has occurred which calls me im-

"I hope the general has not contributed
to make Mr. Graham's stay so unpleasing,"
returned the senator.

some minutes, however, they seemed to feel
the importance of their trust, and they turn-
da away, as if afraid of looking at.the se-
ductig bottle. The second boatman now
came, and after having taken the same li-
bationm, both threw themselves again on t .-
ground."
The effect of the bad example was slow.
but irresistible. One of the Oconees rose,
and casting a doubtful glance round, as if
afraid of being seen by the dreaded Pawnee,
he stole towards the kettles, and seizing the
offered tumbler, swallowed its contents with
an avidity that extorted a low contemptuous
laugh from the backwoodsman. Another
of his brethren followed, looking round in
the same wary manner; a third and a fourth
succeeded; still no Pawnee appeared, and
their thirst got the upper hand of their fear,
Again the fi-st of the Geonees advanced
with somewhat tmre assurance, and again
the rest followed, till their draughts became
so frequent, that timy stretched themselves
on the ground. in a state of insensibility.
The obliging Frenchman cane now saun-
tering towards the Indians, and casting an
indifferent glance at the besotted savages,
stepped hastily down towards the canoe,
gaud lifted the mat.
" Monsieur Lafitte," whispered he.
The head rose again.
Putting his hand cautiously under the,
mat, he severed the thongs with which the
arms of the pirates. were p3imiioned, with a
single effort, and dropping his knife and a
small bottle into the canoe, he again step-
ped back on the bank.
For some time there was no sign of any
movement, but, after a few minutes, a light

stir betrayed that the prisoners were en-
deavoring to restore the circulation of blood
in their limbs. As they had been only par-
tially bound during their passage down the
Red river and the Mississippi, having alter-
nately the free use of either of their hands,I
and of their feet, they regained their mo-
tion sooner than was even expected aby the
Frenehman,
" These savages," said he to the boat-1
men, apparently with much concern, "are
as drunk as beasts: they will lose their
guns; we must put them into the canoe."
The boatmen remained in their listless atti-
tude, without giving a reply. The solici-
tous Frenchman stepped down with the
guns.
"Sir," said he in French, "it is time."
Very well-your name, Sir," said the
lshy voice of Lafitte.
rLouis Marseille."
"You have my word of honor for a thous-
and Napoleons."
"Good !-make haste !"
The Frenchman had scarcely ascended
.the bank, before the mat slided into the
stream with a light rushing sound. The
noise of the mat made the boatmen'run to-
wards the canoe. tha now darted across the
stream like an animat d being, impelled by
the powerful hands of 'he skilful oarsmen,
who regained with every stroke more of their
former strength. For a moment they looked
at the swift canoe that became suddenly peo-
pled with a swarthy, weather-beaten, and
suspicious-looking race ; then recollecting
the custom-house officers, and the manou-
vres of the Frenehman,they began to suspect
foul play ; they reared their double-jointed
masses with morequickness than might have
been expected from 'their sluggish nature,
and jumping into their skiff off the flat boat,
gave the fugitives full chase, without being
in the least disconcerted by their numbers-
d   "Messieurs !" cried a man from the canoe,
that darted already fifty yards before them.
At the ame time pointing a rifle towards
-"  them.
Fa"Fire away, Mesheers," cried the back-

woodsman, not in the least daunted by , the
sight."
But the canoe was too lightly built and
too well manned, not to gain with every
stroke of the oar on their pursuers; and af-
ter a few minutes of fruitless struggle, the
two men returned to their former station.
the sun was now setting. A crowd corn-
ing from the city, was fast thronging towards
the upper quay. Amidst the glittering arms
of the regulars, the lofty forms of El Sol and
Tokeah could be distinctly seen. A fierce,
terrible yell burst from the throats of the
Indians. The flat boat that lay below the=
canoe, had for a considerable time concealed
the escape of the pirate, and it was not un-
til they had gained the current of the stream,
that it became visible to the keen eyes of
the Indians. Leaving the regulars behind,
they darted 'ith immense leaps towards the
spot where their drunken men lay, and ar-
rivet just w'hen the boatirmen had again Idn'd-
ed. A glance at their brethren betrayed the
ole-without hesitating a moment they
tI ew themselves into the skiff.
But the pirates had too great an advan-
tage over their pursuers, and notwithstand-
ing the extraordinary skill of the Indians in
handling their pars, and their still greater
exertions, yet such was the superior and al-
most flying swiftness of the birchen canoe,
that the pirates were approaching the right
bank before the Indians had even passed a
third of the stream.
There was, - however, another point to-
wards which the pirates turned their eyes
with anxiety. Three ships lay at anchot
near the shore, where they were to land.
There was evidently a short consultation,
and 'even indecision among them, of which:
their pursuers availed themselves, by ie-
doubling their efforts. The fierce yell that
resounded nearer and nearer, cut short the
consultations
They pushed with renewed vigor towards
the bank. As not the slightest stir on board
these vessels was to be observed, the spirit
of' the fugitives seemed to revive. They
were within gun-shot distance, when they
found the ships entirely deserted. The sal-

"Well," said the sergeant, considerably
erest-fallen, and in a tone still lower.-
"You may go and try your chance, but ten
to one they are gone ; and if you find them,
ye'll het buj dry blows, and maybap more.
My mnen are tired ; but, if you think-"
A sullen silence betrayed that none were
willihg to go on so dangerous an expedition.
It is too late," said the old chief, in a
voice in which shame and ire were fearfully
mingled.
"And will the mike let his enemies es-
cape ?" demanded El Sol, with surprise, in
the Indian language.
"Shall the red men become the hunting"
dogs of the whites? Enough of blood has
been shed for them. Not a drop more shall
flow. Does El Sol know the path of these
woods? Can his eye see the.trail when all
is dark?  Does he want to see his braves
killed by robbers ?"
The old chief spoke these words with a
decision that sprung perhaps as much from
hatred to his enemies, as some, not entirely
subdued, predilection foir the pirate, who,
notwithstanding the dark treachery that had
cost him his only child, kept still his hold
on a mind, that in hatred ks well as love,
was impelled more by instinctive tenacity
than reason. , El Sol listened in silence to
the talk of his father-in-law-making now
a sign to his men, they' returned to their
canoe, which, in the meanwhile, had been
brought back, and theyrecrossed the stream.
CHAPTER XXIX.
After having traversed an immense tract
of country under difficulties which only In-
dians couli overcome in so short a time,
and in parts seldom or never trodden by hu-
man foot-the mike with his son-in-law
had at last arrived at the place of their des-
tination, as we have seen.
Their diffeulties had begun as soon as
they had issued from the Red river. The
numerous mansions on the banks of the
Mississippi, the scattered villages, the threat-
ening mien of the black and white people,

A

and the suspicious glances with which they
'vere measured on theih passage, had augur-
ed to theri an evil reception, These diffi-
culties were by no means diminished, when
they at'last beheld the city, with its bustle
and warlik preparations, and the thousands
of br ick jnd stone buildings, every one of
which was considered by them as an im-
pregnable fortress.
It was, therefore, with no-little''satisfac-
tion that the miko heard the well-known
voice of his young white brother, the Eng-
lishmnan ; and the desire 'of joining him who
might direct them in this civilized wilder-
ness, contributed greatly to the'haste with
which they darted ~after the steanmboat.
They were driven off the bank with a con-
temptuous roar that stung the proud chiefs
to the quick. It was the first shock that
their pride had received, and they land-
ed under gloomy forebodings.- They neg-
lected none of those precautions which they
would have taken in their own;villages ;
but, unacquainted with the mixed;character
of 'the population of the big village,- as
they called the city, they considered the
prisoners as secure in'the canoe as if they
had been in their owin town. They doubt-
ed, not in the least, that the pirates had es-
caped with the assistance of the whitest as
they called the Americans, and that even
the chief himself had connived at it. - The
coolness with which he had 'received' the
news, and the manner in whichthey had
been arrested in, their pursuit, confined
them greatly in their suspicion.
When they had again landed on the left
shore, they were 'received with a low' taunt-
ing laugh that resounded from the'idlers
who had gathered round the drunken Indi-
ans. The two chiefs exchanged significant
glances, but their countenances betrayed
not the least symptom of what was passing
in their minds. Calm and proud, they dis-
posed of the Oconees by leading them, with
therest'of the men, to the lodging which
had been assigned to them, while' they
themselves went, accompanied by the ser-
geant, to the residence of-the general. lie

cers of the staff and his adjutants. His
countenance had assumed an expression of
condescension that, equally far from super-
cilious haughtiness and forward familiarity,
seemed calculated to inspire them with a
salutary respect.
The Indians stood a considerable while
before the general, who was alternatively
eyeing his visitors, in whose tirien something
like a calm sullenness was clearly legible ;
lie opened the couverstltion by saying, "'Ihe
pirate has cheated the men of the two chiefs
-I am sorry for it."
The Indians gave no answer; they kept
their eyes fixed on the floor.
"But," demanded the *eneral, "how has
the pirate found out the path that leads to
the wigwams of my red brethren ?"
The thief wanted to kill the buffalo
and the deer," replied the old niko,
The general seemed satisfied.
"The chief of the whites," resumed lie,
after a pause, "has weighed the words of
his young brother, the chief of the Cuman-
d1ees, and has found them good. He has
set his white brother free."
The   countenance of the  Cumanchee
brightened with satisfaction. Tokeah, how-
ever, was unmoved to all appearance.
"And why did the miko of the Oconees
take the promise from the youth that he
would not tell to the white men where he
has his villages ? Are the Oconees rapa-
cious wolves, that they hide themselves in
their holes, afraid of being seen by day-
time ?"
"Does my great father like to show
what is dear to him to thieves ?" replied
the old Indian. "The Oeonees do not
hide their wigwams from the white men,
but from the white thieves who come to
steal their cattle and their corn, and to burn
their wigwamns. They want to live in peace
with them, and far from them."
"And the old chi ef has quitted the good
lands of his fathers, and gone into a bad
country on the Saltlake, where the shells
cut his moccasins."
"If the red man has a handsome woman
who will not cook for him, and make his

s hunting shirt and his mneasins, he sends
f her back to her father's wigwam, and takes
an uglier wo nan, who will do for him what
he wants, and will not run after the young
men.   "Tokeah," continued he, "has
lived in the land of his fathers, and among
the white men, with his people. If their
horses or their cattle went across the line,
they durst not go and catch them, and if
they did,.the whites took their lives as if
they were buffaloes. If the cattle of the
white men came over our lines they came
and took them, and those of the red ien
too. Tokeah cannot live with such men."
"But," said the general, "have the red
men no bad brethren among themselves?
There are bad men among every people."
"The red men," replied the Indian,
"punish their bad men, and they drive
them from their villages ; but the white
men," shaking his head, "take the part of
their had brethren. It is far to the Great
Father, and he does not hear the cries of
his red children; and Tokeah is therefore
going where he will never see their trail."
"And so the chief of the Oconees isn
going to the Cumanchees, and has bright-
ened the link with them ?" demanded the
general, as if willing to elicit something
more from the reserved old han.
"The chief of the Cumanehes," said the
old man, in a melancholy tone, "is the son
of the miko; he took into his wigwamn her
whom he had delivered from the fire-death."
Where is the woman ?" demanded the
general.
"She is now laid low," replied the In.-
dian.
"And how came this about ?"
"The balls _of the pirate have pierced
her heart."
A long pause ensued. The general had
probably caught a glimpse of the further
views of the old chief,,whose inveterate en-
mity towards the whites was so clearly legi-
tie in his mien; and perhaps wit the in-
tention 'of impressing El Sol with  ,ter
opinion, he said-
" There is no doubt that the red men
have suffered in some points from the whites,

ROSA, THEID
ht they have. certainly done as much
wrong to us as we dil to them. They
should remember that we are as lawful pos-
lessors of the land as they are, and certain-
ly the strongest. We could havo made
them slaves, and sent them into our mines,
as the Spaniards did. We have left them
their lands; and treated them as brethren."
"The Great Spirit," returned the old
chief, "has made the big river run from
where the snow  falls, towards the land
where the sun shies very warm and, burns
the face of man. He has given to the red
nmen end to the white men, plenty of lands.
Why are the white men never satisfied, and
stretch out their hands for what belongs to
their red brethren, and take, with every
summer, more of the lands where their fa-
thers are buried ?"
"The whites have bought their land
rom the red men; and it is, therefore, their
jest property."
"They have made thered men drunk
with their fire-water, and then cheated
them out of their lands," replied the old In-
dian.
"Chief," said the general, not without
vehemence, "the Great Spirit has made
the lands for the white men, and for the.
red men, that they may live on the fruits
which grow on the earth, and dig the soil,
and plough the ground, but not for hunting
grounds, that some thousands of red nen
may find deer, where millions of happy
people aught live peacefully. If you keep
those lands which are left to you, and
plough aid hoe the ground, you may live as
well as we do, and as independently as we
live. You will have the same right as we
have. But if you choose a roaming hunt-
ing life, you nu  abide the consequences,
and look for the desert.
"The Great Spirit has made very big
spiders in the pountry where Tokeah lived,"
raid the old Indian, "and many of them
will kill a bird, Thes'e spiders said to the
red bird, 'Look, we will let you alone, and
ee will not break the peace with you; but
you must not tear our nests.' The poor
red birds kept in their nests, and waited

there fore a long time. Hunger P ove them
out of them.   When they stirred, they
found all the woods overrun with the nets
of the big spiders, and. the poor red birds
fell into them; and the big 'spiders sucked'
out their blood, and made them (ie a slow
death. The whites are the spiders, the red
men are the red birds. Their tribes were
many; but they are swept from the face of
the earth. They died by the-bre-water and
the cunning of the whites. Tokeah will go
far from them."
"That you may do, as I told you," said
the general, whose' ire began to increase. f
"(The white men will not sow bricrs in your
path, whatever your designs may be; but I
want you to know that we are both gener-
ous in rewarding our friends and have suf-
ficient power to punish our enem:es." When
he had spoken these words he turned from
the old man towards the young chief; and
having paused awhile, he said, " y young
brother is again going to join his people.
He will tell them-how much the chief of'
the Whites honors the young warrior who
has been just towards his white brethren,
and he will brighten the link between:the
white and the red men."  He stepped to-
wards the table, took a golia meal sus-
pended by It silken band, and hung it round
the neck :of the young warriors "Take
this," said he, "as a token of friendship
from the white-chief; and be in future, as
you have been hitherto, the friend of the
wh4te people; and if you again see a vic-
tim oppres ed, then remember the donor,
and hasten to his relief."
The Indian suered the medal to be hung
round his neck; and then laying his left
hand on his breast, h'e took witu ls right
the hand of the general; and putting it on
his forehead, he bowed. He then stepped
back. "The chief of the Cumanchees goes
on a long path ; and' he will nut see the
great white chief any more, of whom the
tongue 'of the red man talks as of one of the
greatest warriors.  But he will tell his
Pawnees of the Toyask villge-of the
great and lust chief of the whites, hat they
may spare the ives of his bret lern. But,"

added he, and his mien assumed a loftiness
that startled even the tried veterans, " imy

must never cross the waters which Waem
dalh has made to separate the red from the
white men. El Sol must do as

the Cunmanchees could not save the brethren
of the great chief.
"Farewell, noble youth !" said the gen-
eral, stretching out his hand, which was
taken by the young man with marked def-
erence.
All the officers shook hands with him-
and the general, waving his hand to the mi-
ko, both chiefs again left the saloon, fol-
loved aby the orderly, who conducted them
to their lodgings.
CHAPTER XXX.
The night passed to both our parties in a
state of mind little different from that of a
prisoner of war who is on the eve of setting
out fur his hoame. The 'Indians looked at
the splendid dwelling and entertainment
wien the liberality of their white lather
had provided for them with a momentary
.uriosity, again relapimg into that state of
excitement that might he compared to the
inquietude with which the king of the Af-
ricau deert-is seen pacing up and down his
iron cage warily glancing at every opening
that could give him a chance to break
fourth.
Arthur -Graam and Rosa were scarcely
less auimted. rherd were many causes
that e mitributed to banish sleep from the
ecs of theu Englishman. His interview
with the general had left a deep impression
on his m ud, mixed with a feeling of hum-
aleim 1lie. He had no doubt been treated
Sin a just and lawful manner ; but at the
same tine, it seemed with a coldness, the
reumembmance of which still caused a chill-
ing sensation in the heart of time chivalrous
Eugi;siaan. To this humiliating, at least
not very pleasing thought, came the idea o
a da ar mather, whose heart might be broken
at the loss of her two only children, of his

sister, an d then of Gabriella, whose tearful
eye betra" d the pang which tore her bosom
-R-Ilosa  ,rself, too, of whose ulterior des-
tination he was still uncertain. "Will they
give her up ?" did he repeatedly ask him-
self.  "Will they not force her ba'ek ? And
if they dol  " Ilis heart shrank, from fur-
ther thoughts.
Similar were the fears of Rosa, though
her agitation sprung from another source.
She loved so deeply ; every pulse throbbed
for Arthur; it was her first, her only love;
and she gave herself up to the glowing pas-
sion in the sweetest anticipation. But ho
was, she now felt more than ever, so much
above her. He moved so gracefully among
the fair Creoles, that he had attracted the
eyes of the fairer of the two. Love is sensi-
tive; and the long lingering glances of Ga-
briella had not escaped her. Her heart
saddened at the thought of her own un-
worthiness and simplicity. She was but a
child of the forest-simple and uneducated.
Such and similar fears agitated the poor
muiden, and kept her awake through the
night. Morning hred not yet dawned when
she sprung from her couch and resumed her
dress. She paused and listened. No sound
was to be heard-all was buried in sleep
and silence.  She sat down, and watched
another hour; and   now   footsteps were
heard. Some one came up stairs.     She
opened the door. It was a female servant.
"Where is Aytlhur ?" demanded she, with
a low whisper, as if afraid of being over-
heard.
"In his room," answered the girl.
" Tell him to come to Rosa; she is
waiting for him ?" said the innocent mai-
den.
The Negro girl shook her head. "A gen.
tlemmian," said she, "must not go into a lady's
sleeping-room."
Poor Rosa blushed deeply.
"I will tell Bambo," said the girl; "but
I must not go there."
She went down, and returned again in a
few minutes, saying that the gentleman was
dressed, and wished to see her in the draw-
ing-room,

"Oh, lead me there!" she said, tripping
after the girl.
She entered, when Arthur and the sena-
tor walked from the second door into the
room,
The morning salutations were whispered
scarcely audidle. Rosa slipped on a pelisse;
and taking the arm of the senator, they
went down stairs, followed by a servant.
They knew what awaited them, and not a
word was spoken. Trlhe streets were desert-
ed.s. The pale, flickering light of a not yet
extinguished lamp announced the morning\
twilight. Scarcely a human form was to
be seen, except the sentinels, who paced up
and down at their posts. They found a
waiter stationed before the public, house,
who conducted them into the parlor, where
the Indians sat assembled in deep and grave
consultation.
The young chief rose, and advanced to-
wards the entering visitors to receive Rosa,
whom he led to the settee close to Tokeah,
and pointed silently to two empty chairs.
Arthur surveyed for a moment the Apollo-
like form of the lofty young Indian-the
complete picture of a noble Highland chief,
but for his color-and then sat down, got
without uneasiness.
The old miko had scarcely looked up,
and continued in his deep musing. After
r        a long pauses he turned his head; and
looking round, said, in the Indian tongue,
.        "Where is the White Rose, whom Tokeah
picked up from among the horses in the
woods ? Has she forgotten the beaver-
skins which the miko gave to the white
trader, that she might drink of his woman's
milk, and not wither away for want of
food?"
Rosa began to look pale at these words.
"aTokeah," continued the old man, "took
'her into his wigwam, and made her the
foremost among the girls of the red men."
Again he paused.
"Shall the old miko have no daughter?
Will the White Rose leave her father, who
has given her food, and follow a stranger?
Who will cook his venison when he returns
A         wrom the hunting-grounds?  Tokeah has ,

given the White Rose to a great chief, that
the heart.of the old mike may find joy in
his children, and that their voices may
sweeten his days when he shall be no longer
able to hunt the buffalo."
"Father !" cxclaimred Rosa, writhing
with. agony.
"Here is the bravest of the braves,"
said the old chief, rising slowly, and with
solemnity taking her land, and laying it in
that of El Sol.
Arthur and the senator stood in mute and
dreadful suspense. Without comprehend-
ing his words, they understood their mean-
ing; yet such was the stern solemnity of
the withered, ghastly-looking old man, that
they sat rivetted, in breathless' anxiety,
without being able to move.
El Sol had listened all the while with, a
forbearance which, though evidently pain-
ful to him, was too essential a part of good-
breeding with an Indian not to be strictly
observed. He received the, hand of Rosa.
Rising at the same time, and turning to the
,old mico, he saidin, a low, solemn tone,
"Wacondahhas spoken;-h:is voice calls El
Sol to the prairie of the Cumanchees. He
will find a wife there, as his father did.
The sons of El Solshall be wholly Cuman-
chees. Never will he lead a wife into his
wig vam whose heart is turned to another.
El Sol has already stayed too long with the
White Rose. He has beheld her-he will
never forget her; but he must not look at
her any more."
He led the maid, in silence, towards Ar-
thur, who arose, and grasped her hand.
"My young brother," said he, in broken
English, "has kept what he has promised
to the miko, and El Sol will keep what he
has promised to Canondah, his daughter,
who is laid low." ;The young chief return-
ed again t the settee, and sat down.
"Lister, then," resumed the old man, in
the Engl'sh language, "that you may re-
member the talk of the miko. When the
White Rose lay beneath-the horses and their
hoofs, on the road that leads from the big
village wh.ore we are now through the coun-
"y of the Choctaws, she wa a sucking

came into the hands of the miko of the Oeo-
nees, and who were those that gave her
birth. 'Tokeah has watched for his daugh-
ter mor thian for his life. His thoughts ran

with the to::;;e of his son, and his voice

the mik of the Oconees held with one of
the trad ., that it may be remembered, and
not die A a  him."
He h. a id the youth a paper, sealed with
a wafer m   which the chain was enclosed.
* " Ti id men," continued he, " know

words.
" I wL    'r lied the Englishman.' "

hands ,          in, and bowed. Not a
word u          't The Indian sat silently
down.            'r took the rifle and the
knife, '.     .-t of the fatal Indian out-

floor, and then left the room.
When they came down stairs they found
two Indians, with the trunk and the packet.
The carriage of the senator was at the door.
The servants put both articles into it, and
it rolled again homewards. The morning
had, in the meanwhile, advanced ; and when
they entered the drawing-room they found
the family assembled. The parting scene,
however, had left a deep impression on their
minds, and they received the morning coin-
pliments in silence. Eleanor tripped round
and round, with a face that was a little'
soured. Her curiosity had been put to a
hard trial, and was, in fact, the only motive
of her early rising. Her noisy movements
had awakened the whole house-mother,
brother, and sister. As soon as she under-
stood the principal persons had gain eseap
ed without begging her leave, she could keep
silence no longer.
" Wlre have you been, papa ?" demand-
ed Eleanor, a little nettled that they had
gone without asking her leave.  "Very
soon I shall believe that we arc in an en-
chanted castle.  Nothing hat mysteries.
Here we are running up stairs and down
stairs, and looking and waiting, and you are
all over the city.''
Rosa flew- on her neck. "Oh! do not be
angry. We saw my father."

"F lather ?" denuanded Eleanor. " You
do not mean the Indian ?"
a Yes," replied Rosa.
"Oh! do not call that nasty savage
father."
" That is not the voice of my Eleanor,"
said the senator, with rather a sternaeeent.
"Few fathers would have done what these
Indians did.'
He explainedo his family what he had
just witnessed.
Eleanor had tripped up to the window,.atl
saw the trunk and packet carried it) the
house. Its extei'ior was too promising nat
to acite the curiosity of the merry girl she
opened the daar of the saloon, and wnt into
the eorridor. The senator cast a siguilicant
glance at Arthur.      a

" There is some attractive power," whis-
pered he, with a smile-" we must satisfy
the troublesome girl."
The servants brought~both trunk and box
into the drawing-room.
"Do you like to see Indian= fashions ?"
demanded the Creole of his daughter, while
the'servant opened it.
The girls tripped towards the open trunk,
with an awe with which a connoisseur would
approach the veiled painting of a} Raphael
d'Urbino. Eleanor lifted one of the robes
with a sort of respect that extorted from her
-father a fit of langhtcr.
"For Heaven's sake," exclaimed she,
"where does that come from?7"
"Not from the Indians, certainly,"' said
the planter.
"And that.?" taking another,   'But
what is this ?" catching up the morocco
casket.
" Indian beads, in all probability," re-
turned the planter.
Arthur opened it-a necklace of brilliants,
with braclets and ear-rings of sparkling
atones, dazzled their eyes, arid attracted
oven the attention of the Creole.
"They are, indeed, beautiful; worth more
than a hundred thousand francs," said he.
"See, Eleanor, in what manner the Indians
provide for their children."
" Oh ! tell me," said the girl, with an air
of droll impatience, "where such as these'
.are made ?"
"In London," replied Arthur, "and 'for
mysister."  .
"Oh, they will exactly suit Rosar!" ex-
elaimed the girl, taking at the same time
ithe measureof Rosa. ' Come, now, child!
come! we ipust dress you-we have every-
thing; c'ne !-come !" and each of them
taking hold of Rosa, ran with her to their

through the country of the Choctaws from
the big village of the white men, on the
endless river, a party of the warriors of the
Choctaws of the six villages. In the midst
of them were four white men and three
white women, one of whom was very young,
and very tender, mounted on horses. A
fight ensued between the Oconees and the
Choctaws, who were at war, and the latter
were put to flight. That the, four white
men, who had killed many braves, of they
Oconees, were caught by them, and scalped,
with the women ; none but the child was
saved. The clothes of the women were very,
fine, says the same manuscript, and they .
got for thema-and their beads a great many
blankets and gnns. Here the information
ceased. There was Uo date, no name what-
soever.
S'The information," said the senator, "is
precious, and may lead to disclosures. But
let us see further."
'hey now examined the gold chain. It
was of Mexican worknanship, and of .ex
traordinary fineness. On it hung a medal-
lion, on the one side of which was.engraved
a coat of arms, surmounted with a coronet
--three Saracen heads, with a sabr over
their. On the other side were engraved the
letters, 6 J. d'A."
"This eoat of arms," said the senator,
who prided himself not a little on his de-
scent from an old French fainily, " this coat.
of arms shows clearly an ancient family. I
understand something about heraldry. But

ling to accompany you, provided she is per-
mitted to do so by the general."
'There is no little question about that,"
replied the senator.  I am really glad of
it. Without female companions, I could
not see how you are to take her along with
you. Delicacy towards those with whom
we are goiug to enter into closer ties, is the
laughter of respect, and the mother of hap-
piness. 'It will, hwever be necessary to

sat down and wrote a few lies, which he
gave to a servant. " I am afraid," said the
senator, " you will have a hard game wtithj
the girls. They are so fond of her, that I
ani sure the mere mention of palling will,
fall heavy on them--they are just coming."
The trio returned with Rosa, again met-
ainorphosed.  A  light green riding-dress
enclosed her sylph-like form, and was bound
round her waist by a girdle, with a gold
aigrette. She moved with an easy, grace-
ful step, towards Arthur, and looking tim-
idly, and yet confidently up toihim, said,
"See what my sisters have done with poor
Rosa," laying at the same time her hand on
his arm.
"Pie, for shame!" whispered Eleanor,
" You must not do that.
" Why not ?" said she, clasping his arm
still faster, as if afraili lest he might escape
her.
" Be a little more distant, a little more
proud, and cold. You must by no means
show to the lords of the creation, as they
call themselves, what is passing in this weak
corner," pointing to her heart.
" But Rosa cannot conceal what her heart
speaks so loudly."
. Mistaken child !" said the vivacious
girl. "But we will teach you-in six months
you will be a proficient." '
"But she departs to-day," said the sena-
tor.

tie concealed their unpleasant sensations.
"Rosa-perhaps, in a few hours."
''How, paa ?"    said  Eleanor, " yen
again jest with your poor girls ; but if ye
kiew how you are tormenting us, you would
not do it."
"I speak truth," said the senator.
For a while the girls looked attheir either,
then at Rosa, and again at Arthur, with a
mien in which the most unpleasant surprise
was strongly depicted.
And is it really so? And will you, Mr.
Graham, leave us, and take Rosa with you? "
"I must," said Arthur.  "A dear, and
perhaps a heart-broken mother, and my
poor sister, demand it iirfperiously."
"Oh ! you may go," said Eleanor a little
peevishly, " but leave us Rosa-yon cannot
take her along with you."
All the preparations afead--Madamet
Grillard will accompany Rosa " said the
father.
"Do not leave us, Rosa," begged both
girls, each taking her by an arm " reainan
with us, Rosa-Arthur will soon return."
"Return! and Arthur will go without
Rosa," said she, slowly, as if afraid of giv-
ing utterance to her fetrs. H1r eye became
dim, her whoc 'ountenance hind changed
into a deadly paleness. Arthur flew towards
her-he placed his aria around her. \
" Arthur will not go without Rosa," said
he, in a soothing tone  "Nothing shall
again separate us."
For a moment she looked up to him, asif
doubting his words. When, however, his
open, confiding eye met hers, she said,
" Arthur must not go without Rosa. It
would break her heart," laying her hand on
her bosom. " Arthur promised her red
father to become a brother to her."
"It would not do," said the Creole. "It
would really break her heart."
phe certainty of losing their new friend,
and more especially Rosa, whose transcend-
ant beauty and harmless innocence hud won
the hearts of all the family, threw a gloom
over the circle, which soon brought tears

ROSA, THE INDIAN CAPTIVE.

into the eyes of the girls. The breakfast
p passed over in deep silence, as did the fol-
lowing hour. It seemed a second to those
who wished to prolong it to years.
Madame Qrillard now made her, appear-
ance. She was an elderly lady, ofthe true
French school. She ha.d spent'he greatest
part of her life iteducating the children of
the wealthier Creoles. She entered her of-
lice as duenna almost assoon as she came
intothe parlor, by casting a half-forbidding
19ok at Rosa, whose hand was: still locked
in that of Arthur.
. "And so, noon ready 7" demanded the
senator.
"Happily, II-ept' myself in readiness,"
returned the lady, "though it was intended
my journey should take another direction."
" Ah! I understand-up the Mississippi.
I trust the Englishmen will not be so nun-
gallant as to plunder our ladies."
" The French," said she, 66 are the most
gallant people; and-yet     -
"True," said the senator.  .
'However," exclaimed Eleanor, who had
tripped to the window, "you do not intend
to take all these movables to Jamaica,
madam?"
"And where else, miss 7" returned Mad-
mne Grillard, sharply.
"Come, and see, papa," said the 'droll
girl, a tear still twinkling in her eye.
A wagon,. loaded with a dozen trunks;
and a dozen or more boxes, halted before
tih house.
"You cannot take these things to Jamai-
ea," said the senator, who, notwithstanding
his efforts, could not suppress a smile.
" They would freight a boat of twenty tons
burden. You have but one carriage, and:I
a  uncertain whether I shall be allowed
to send mine alon."
"Charming!" exclaimed Eleanor. "That
vill gain us another hour.
Bat itpassed as quickly as the former;
and Madame Grillard returned sooner than
was expected, with her diminished stock-
till sufficient, however, to affright a poor
gentleman, who was destined to sit in a car-

riage, blocked up on every side with such
agreeables.
The senator now sent word to the adju--
taut, at Arthur's request. He soon made
his appearance in the carriage of the com-
;yander. After having saluted the company,
he said to Arthur, " The general has direct-
ed me to deliver his .best wishes to Mir.
Graham and the young lady fQr a happy
journey. He has not the least objection to
the departure of Madame Grillard.,
The Englishman bowed politely.
"I am further, to inform ,Mr. Graham
that the commander of the, British fQrces
has expressed his desire to have as sog as
possible the pleasure of seeing Mr., Gsa-
,m. His carriage will be waiting half-
way between the two camps."
The information was received by the Eng-
lishman with another silent bow.
The hour of separation was -now come.
The regret was unfeigned, and .fell heavy
on the whole noble-minded family. It was
long before Arthurcould tear himself frpm
the almost paternal embrace of the Creole.
The parting scene with Madame Gentillon
was shorter, but not less affectionate. It
was still shorter with Eleanor. He .now
took the hand of Gabriella. 6" The inter-
est," said he, in a low whisper, "which the
noble Miss Gentillon has taken in my fate,
at a period when I seemed to deserve it so
little, will for ever be one of my sweetest
recollections."
' Mr. Graham," said Gabriella, with dig-
nity, "was unhappy and suffering, and this
gave him a   laim to the sympathy of-"
The senator now approached, -and cut
short a'scene which,'he--felt, could not ut
increase the heart-ache of his daughter
" Rosa," said Mrs. Gentillon, 'vhile she
held the maiden inher arms, lookig 'mild-

mother, on the wide earth. Your father 'is

!loss of both his daughters, become more so ;
she was absorbed in thought, and seldom
did a word escape him. The young chief
bad watched the hapless, lone old man with
increasing tenderness. When the canoe had
gained the little harbor, where hundreds of
vast trees were riding quietly at anchor, the
old chief pointed to an immense cotton tree,
whose prostrate trunk stretched into the
river, with its top buried in the mud. The
canoe glided swiftly between the trees, and
halted at the point. The old man swung
himself on the tree, and crept up the bank,-
followed by El Sol and the whole band.
When he had reached the bank, he threw
himselff on the ground, and lay fora while mo-
tionless. The warriors stoodround him, their
eyes rivetted on the miko, their heads sunk
on their chest, their hands folded together; l
but not a sound broke the solemn silence.
"Earth !" groaned the old man, still ly-
'lug on the ground, and the wyiud raising hist
/glossy, silvered hair, "earth, that hast seen
the sons of 1im who gave birth to the son 1

of thy boundless forests was he born-the Â°
miko of a mighty people was he chosen, as
his fathers were. A fugitive, he now stands t

bosom, a stranger to thee and to the graves
of his fathers. Great Spirit, why hast thou t

The oldman looked up to the wide vault a
of heaven with an imploring eye. It was b
overcast. The north blast moaned through
the forest. Tokeah's eye became wistful.

The chief now rose with dignity; and
motioning to his friends, he said, with a
melancholy solemnity, "Seven summers
have passed since the msiko of the Oconees
turned his back on the land where his fore-
fathers dwelt. Two times he has crossed
the big river since, unseen, alone, to lie on
the graves of his fathers. He was hunted
like the rapacious panther that seeks its
prey. It is for the last time that lie now
stands on the lands where his fathers have
lived. While he was in the great villae,
of the white mei, and in the painted wylls
of the wigwam, 'here their chief had put
him with his breth'"n, his head rolled rest-
less on the couch that was prepared for him
by the enemies of his race. 'Go,' said the
spirit of his father, who dwells in the green
prairie,.'go to my grave, and collect from it
the bones of him who gave life to thee, and
of her whose breast gave thee suck; take
them from their dark abode, and fromhose
who scorn them, and who send their hoofed
beasts to tread upon'Them. Let them re-
pose. in the same ground where my son and
his people are dwelling, and rest them among
the bones of the red men. Be not afraid of
moving then ; no curse shall attend thee.'
Tokeah arose," continued the chief, " when
he spirtt had spoken to him, and his soul
was troubled. Again he lay down on the
couch of the white men. 'The hoc,' said
he spirit of his father, 'has passed overthe
hillock of death where thy father lies ; a
hort time, and his bones will be cast from

wards the young chief, "Tokeah must do

must take the bones of his fttler that they
nay rest undisturbed. He most leave

El Sol listened respectfully.
"Has the spirit of his father spoken to

after a paOise, with a voice whose low

will take them  now where no despiteful
hand shall uplift them. He will seek for
them a place where his own bones shall
rest. He will bury them among the people
who will revenge thee on thy nefarious inL
traders. Thou shalt look with joy on thy
children, and glory in their deeds. But thy
son is like an aged oak-the blast has
withered his strength-the storm has shiv-
ered his limbs-his spirit groans. His chil-
dren are his people. Spirit of my father, if
thou beholdest the face of the Great Spirit,
petition him for thy son and his children."
(The barking was again heard.)  "I hear
the sounds of the forerunner of the enemies
of my race.   Farewell, my native land !
Farewell, trees, in whose shade Tokeah has
so often taken the cool mid-day breeze after
a long hunt ! Farewell, stream, in whose
waters he has so many times refreshed his
limbs, and where he first paddled the canoe !
Farewell, hills, on which his father taught
him to send the quick arrow !"
The moon 'poured once more her light
from the flying clouds, and the barking was
heard for the third time.

looked with a Lright eye on the deed of thy
child--show him his path to the prairies of
the Cumanchees."
The chief now arose; and laying the cof-
fin softly on his shoulders, as if afraid to
disturb the remains, he threw the thong
over his neck, and hastened back to the
Cumanchees. "The spirit of my father has
spokpn true, said the old man, with melan-
choly solemnity. "The plough has passed
over the =hillock that enclosed his bones-it
was bud waste."
"Then let us go on our home-path," re-
turned the chief; "and the Great Spirit will
guide us."
Again they crossed the , Mississippi, and
entered the mouth of the Red Rive'. Ten
more days had now passed. They had long
ago left the swampy regions of the Missis-
sippi, and they found themselves on the
high plains that separate the.Arkansas from
the Western Louisiana. Before them lay
the snow- clad tops of the Oyask Mountsins,
beyond which the immense prairies roll and
swell towards the Rocky Mountains.'
El Sol pointed silently to the bright aerial
tints with which these outposts of the
mighty ridges were crowned.   "'Behind
these mountains," said he, " and far down
where the sun shines mildly, and the bread-
tree grows high, there will my - father re-
pose."

the Red River. lie stopp ,l on the bank;

next moment half a dozen of the savages
fell prostrate to the ground. A tremu4ons
yell rent the air from the bank. Quick as
lightning the young chief bounded towards
the guards; The reins, or rather halters,-
dropped from their hands, and they fled with
the utmost precipitancy 'towards the river.
Nothing short of the readiness and expert-
ness of the young chief and his warriors
could have succeeded in catching a dozen of
the animals. So quick, however, were their
j.        movements, that the halters passed almost
instantaneously from the hands of their
enemies into their own. A neighing sound,
a stamping noise, was a1 that was heard
from the rest of the horses. Terror strick-
en, they bounded up, snorted, and then
rushed into the wild waste of the salt prairie.'
The young chief leaped on his horse, and
galloping towards the bank, he picked up
his rifle ; his men followed him. They had
scarcely entered the canoe, their horses
awitnining behind, when the quick .report of
rifles was heard-accompanied by a shower
of arrows.
"Will my son promise the miko to be a
kind father to the Oconees ?" said Tokeah,
with a hollow voice, single balls still whist-
ling about their ears.
"A father and a brother," said the young
chief. "But why does my father talk thus,
he will live long with his children ?"
" Will El So} promise it. by the Great
Spirit ?" repeated the old man, in a more
hollow tone.
"He will," returned the young chief.
"Will he promise to bury Toheah and
his father among his people, the. great Cu-
mantchees ?"
"He wi1," said El Sol, with a slight
shudder.
It was the will of the Great Spirit that
TolLenh shall not behold the lands of the
Comanchees ; he is doomed to die on the
,  lands of the whites."
He muttered a few words into the eais of
ono .of his Oconees, and the savage burst
into a yell of the wildest despair. El 'Sol
seized the arms of the old man. His mands

still grasped the'coffln, whieg reposed on
his knees; but his frame was relaxed. A
ball had entered his breast, and life was
gone. The young chief threw himself over

passed over him. The canoe had long been

sounds of the death song, with the remains
of the lastof the mikos of the Qconees,
CHAPTER XXXII
Years elapsed after these events. It was
on a serene evening.   The setting  sun
was shedding his last rays through the yelp
low tinted cotton and banana trees with
which the dark green alleys of pruned coffee
shrubs, that spread round Graham's seat
were studded, 'Gradually their lengthened
shadows were losing' themselves in the con-
fused colorlessiues of twilight. The dis-
tant hills still gleamed in a garish sunshine.
The evening breeze stole fresher and fresher
from the sea shore. The last sound of the
negro's song had died away. Only the low
notes of a straggling humming-bird about .
the flower-beds, or the merry chattering of
a parrot in the cocoa trees were heard. All
breathed peace and silence.
On he piazza of a magnificent mansion
sat Sir Arthur, and upon his right his beau-
tiful wife Rosa, whom we now introduce to
our'readers as lady Graham.f 'A child, love-
ly as a seraph, played in her arms. From
time to time, the eyes of the happy couple
wandered from their own group to the de-
lightful scenery that lay around them.
"A delicious evening," said Rosa-" I
think we are about to receive a visit," turn-

closed the valley, and from whiÂ°h two ear-

Thanks to Providence, who has disposed it
s well! You are, perhaps, the only being
of whom your uncle is fond."
"He wts really displeased at our depart-
ure," said Sir Arthur, " and grew so strange
and mysterious when we took leave of him.
But what is the most astonishing, he came
the day afterwards to Ludlam Castle to see
Rosa once more-gout, and a host of in-
firmities, notwithstanding."
"He desires your departure from Jamai-

hin a couple of letters, and taking from
Rosa's arm the child, which she caressed
with motherly tenderness.
"Oh, ftom our dear friend Gentillon,"
said Sir Arthur.

A short conversation ensued between the
two strangers ; marked, however, by a sub-

tIed, to have addressed himself, as he found,
to a  ec'ndary personage.  A complying
sign on the part of the one who had hitherto
been silent, brought the speaker and two
servants in a moment from their seats. The
humble alacrity with which they hurried to
let down the steps, and to lift the gentleman
out of the carriage, bespoke a man of rank.
Don Juan, Chevalier d'Aranza, Count
de Montgornez, is pleased to accept of Sir

said the principal person, with loftiness and

the lady mother, "does not intend to reach

shorter tone, doubtless displeased at his. si-'

"Louisiana?" demanded the nobleman,
with a vivacity that contrasted too strongly
with his reserve not to excite the attention
of the family. "Has Sir Arthur been in
that country?"
"It has fallen to my lot," replied the bar..
onet, "to be thrown into those muddy re-
gions, and to be lost there. I may say
with truth, that I. have served my appren-
ticesaip to the Yankees."
"i hope it had a happy result," said the
nobleman.   "The face of the country,"
added he, without waiting for the baronet's
reply, "is very much changed since it came
under the dominion of the United States, I
understand. I am afraid none of the fami.

We need iot say a word to the readers of the WzEK HYlRA 1a in praise of this
capital story of American life. They aie all familiar with it already, in the form
under which it first appeared as a prizedtale, and they will now gladly welcome it
again in its attractive book form. Not only is the plo ingenious and fall of thril-
hag interest, but the author has know so well the ark of concealing art, as to give
the whole a charm of iiaturalness and reality. The characters are real and alive.
We recognize them at a glance as just such persons as "live and move and have
their being" in actual American Society. In fine, aside from  the romantic story
which is lit up by Laura's "Diamond Cross," we find that neither Dickens nor Mrs.
Beecher Stowe,,nor even De Tocqueville has gLven a better an  more truthful picture
of American scenery, life, manners and ideas than is presented in this new Novel of
Mr. Philips.-N. Y Herald.
