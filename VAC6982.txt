"Mother, I'll be consarned if I can see what you want me to keep pokin' 'round home here for, when everybody that is anybody, is off to the wars ' . You helped brother Seth to fit out his privateer, and you wouldn't let me go with him. You gave brother Simeon money to buy him a horse and sword, and bran new Wregimentals, and you wouldn't listen to my going with him, nor so much as buy me a gun to shoot crows with!" These words were uttered not long after the war of the Revolution had got to a fullt red heat "-uttered in a neat and modest mansion, in the then lonely town of New London, the birthplace of almost the only traitor that could he hatched from the egg of treason, during t the time that tried men's souls "-BENEDICT ARNOLD. The speaker was a tall, lean-favored youth, of about nineteen or twenty years Of age, dressed in- a homespun suit, and wearing an old hat, stuck around with cock's feathers, in a most fantastic style.' A sheathless wooden sword was thrust through a rope girdle, that encircled his waist, and he held a piece of board, whittled into a rude resemblance of a gun, at a is carry,", while he spoke. His hair hung in long masses-tangled and curling- down upon his shoulders. His features were rather coarse, and his complexion pale. His large, blue eyes, exhibited that laek-lustre pe- culiar to idiots,- but there were times when they would beam suddenly with the fire of in- ,   telligence, orl flash with the light of anger. And then all Signs of idiocy would depart from face and form, and he would seem to be an al- tered being. But these spells were ever of short duration, and soon he would again re-, lapse into a state of apparent imbecility. He was neither dirty or raggedi however, for a watchful mother and a pitying sister, who was as kind as she was lovely-differing far from. the sisters of these modern days-kept him neat and as comeirtable as possible. Saul Sabberday, the above-described, was speaking to his widowed mother, when we in- troduced him to the reader. Her dress, as well as that of Ruth, her beautiful daughter, a year the junior of Sdul, betokened them to be- long to the same persuasion as did the mother of Nathaniel Greene, the patriot general, who, when she equipped him for the war, said: "I like not thy going into battle, to shed the blood of thy fellow men, Nathaniel; but, if thee thinks it is thy duty, go, and if thee is wounded, come not home to me with a wound in thy baok!" yes; the widow Sabberday and Ruth, gold.: en-haired, blue-eyed, fairy-formed Ruth, the loveliest maidehin the town, by all confessed, were Quakeresses-though her two stalwart sons had ignored the cloth, and gone to fight I their country's battles, the one upon the land, under the very eye of Washington, as an offi- cer in his Life Guard; the other in a dlambing privateer, upo,-k' * "The glad waters 6f the dark, blue ea."   "Why does thee pester me so, Saul?" said the widow, in reply to her son. "What could thee do in the wars?" "Fight the red coats, moter,; charge bag- nets on 'em, and make 'em run jist so!" and, Gaiting the action to the word, he brought his wooden gun to a charge, and advanced so fiercely on Ruth, that she sprang from her chair, and cried: "Have done with thy foolery, Saul; thee had better olarge the turkeys in the yard!" "So I hall, sissy, so I had 1" said Saul, as he "recovered arms." His sister resumed her seat, and needlework again, and Saul brought his gun to an "' or- der," and stood watching her fair little fingers, as they nimbly plied their work. ", Had thee not better go over and see the widow Hale to-day, Ruth?" said Mrs. S. "She has been sorely tried in the death of her only son, and it behooves us, as christians, to mourn with the mourning, and to speak words of comfort to the sorrow-strickent Heaven grant that we, too, may not be called upon to mourn a son and brother 1" Amen, dlear mother!" murmured the gen- tle girl. Anid then she added: "If thee thinks it best that I should go, I will go, my mother, but there are borne who like not to be intruded upon in their grief; the sight, even, of friends swells the overflowing cup!" "True, my sweet child; but thee knows how intimate we have been with the Hales. Nathan thought a world of thee 1" Ruth's pale face was instantly tinged with a bright blush, and a heavy sigh rose from her bosom, as she said-"I will go, mother 1" "Mayn't I go along, sissy.? I'll lay down my gun at the door, and behave proper good," Said Saul.       I  I "Not this time, brother!" replied Ruth, gently. "Thee may walk with me some other day!" "' Then I'll go and fight the turkeys and pigs --gobble, gobble; squeal, squealI Won't I make 'em runI Shoulder arms, right about fac, forward, march i" Obeying his own orders, Saul left the room, and Ruth put on her lilac shawl and plain dtraw bonnet, preparatory to making her visit. "'Ruth, there are some nice newly-baked pumpkin pies in the cupboard, and some fresh   cakes and bread," said the widow. "Thee had better take thy basket and fill it, for the widow, 'tis not likely, has had any heart for baking, since she heard'of Nathan's death!" "I will so do, dear mother," said Ruth, as she hastened to fulfil her parent's wishes. Meantime, from the noise that emanated from the yard, they were informed, that Saul had engaged the enemy. "Poor lad I he has strange ways, yet there is no real harm in him, while there is much goody" sighed the widow, as she heard the racket. "Iooray, hooray I The enemy has run away, and the viot'ry is ours!" cried Saul, marching in, to the tune of Yankee Doodle, whistled by himself. Then, seeing that his- sister was going out with her basket, he said, and intelligence beamed from his eye as he spoke: "Dear sister, please let me carry the basket for you. I'll take off my sojer hat and lay away my gun and cutlash, and put on the cap you made for me, and my Sunday-go-to-meetin' coat, and be so good. Please let me go!" "Well, hurry and fix up, brother-thee may go!" said the gentle sister.  And, with a glad look, he bounded up stairs, and soon returned, improved in dress, and looking far less like an idiot than before. He took the heavy basket, and then Ruth led the way toward the house of the stricken- ed heart,who mourned the loss of her martyred son. When they were gone, that good widow and mother knelt, and-prayed to the God of battles, that He would spare her sons, and not take them from her. CHAPTER II. The wind wad blowing fresh and strong from the eastward, sending in the huge blue waves in heavy rollers toward the rock-bound coast of the old "Bay State." And not far from that coast, heading eastward, the bright moon gleaming softly on her white sails, a beautiful vessel lay rising and falling on the surges, with her foretopsail laid aback and her head sheets flattened in so as to keep her as nearly stationary as she could be when off of anchorage ground. She was long, of great breadth of beam, lay very low in the water,   and looked as if she could outsail anything af0loat-so sharp was. she forward and so clean in her run. Her masts, heavy below, bat ta- pering up to an extraordinary length, raked much more than the spars of vessels generally did in that day, and her yards, forward, were of great length, as were a!so her booms, ena- bling an immense spread of canvas wlhen it was des;rable. She was of that clipper build and rig which has rendered Baltimore famous the world over. Herw armament consisted of six thirty-two pound carronades on a side, which, being lighter than long guns, and more easily worked, being on slides, and carrying the same weight of metal, were far more effi- cient at close quarters than they would be. Amidships, however, was a tool for work at a distance. It was a long brass forty-two pound- er, working on a circular railway between the main and foremast. From the keelson up to the deck beneath this gun, a solid foundation of oak had heen built, and this, with extra car- -lines and knees below , so strengt lened the brig that the heavy shock of so large agun, when it was fired, did not shake her much more than the firing of the carronades. Her rig, neat in every particular, from the turning of her dead-eyes to the fitting of her royal-mast-hleads, was that of a brigantine- square forward; nnd fore and aft-ten her main. Manited by*a picked crew of seventy-five men, enIough for a eraft of two huldrelld tons, sh1) was tfhe picture .of a model man-of-war. Reafetr, you are now introduce on hoard of the good privateer THUNDERBOLT, cruising in search of the foes to American liberty--permit me to make known to you her captain. Seth Sabberday, who, with his night telescope in his hand, is carefully scanning the horizon to windward, for he is right in the track of ves- sels bound from England to Nuw York, which, after they have sighted land at Cape Race or thereabouts, keep down along the coast ijside of the gulf current. He is about medium height, with brown hair long and curling about his stout neck and broad shoulders, his form close knit and .mus- cular, his eyes blue as the sea o'er which lie sails. His features and expression quiet, but firm and resolute, betoken him to be well fitted for the command of such a beauty as that be- neath his fMet,   By his side--one cheek bulged out enor- mously with a huge quidfof tobacco, his hands and arms plunged. elbow-deep into his pea.- jacket pocket--stnds Mr. Elijah Bunker, his first lieutenant or mate, as he/prefers to be called. - .He is about six feet in height, but so lean that he looks even more tall; but what he lacks in fat lie makes up in bone and mus- cle, and if you look in his gray-green eye, you will see at once that there is a bit of the devil in his composition, if he gets waked up. The second officer was a slender,\ gentle- looking youth, one who, at a'first glance, seemed to wear an almost feminine look, so small and white were his hands, so slender his forom, ao dellcate his complexion. His .name was Chester Parsons, but the crew called him '"Gentleman Chet," not in derision, for he was a favorite with them. and more than once al- ready at the head of the boarders had proved that heart, hand, and form, were more than equal to the stoutest of his foes.- I have before alluded to the crew. They were of that hardy class who man our fishing and whaling fleets-young, fearless, and expert. "This wind on fht to bring something along; we're in the right track, Elijah!" said Captain Sabberday to his first officer. "' Reckon 'twill -dreamed o' seein' a chick- en-fight last niglht-two rooeters, one red and t'other one ring-streaked and speckled, like '"Jacob's goats-sure sign!" said Baunker, who wat great on- dreatns and never used any su- pernuimerary words in his conversation. "Which whipped?" asked Captain Seth. (- Jacob's rooster laid the red-coat out--good sign for lour side!" replied Bunker. "Sail, ho!" cried the lookout, who was sta- tioned in the sli ngs of the foreyard, plenty high enough for a night look-out, thlough the moon and stars gleamed so brightly that the vision was by no nmeans circumscribed. ' Red Rooster, by jingo!'" cried Bunker, dis- charging his old quid of tobacco, and " indulg- irg" in a fresh one. "Where away?" shouted  Captain   Soth, springing forward, and nearly capsizing over "Gentleman Chet," who wasJin a   doze on a' carronade slide. Ai Broad on our weather-bow, sir--square- rigged--coming down   with all stun*-sails set up to the to'gallants!" replied the look out./   "Sh'e must be in a hurry, then. All hands to make sail-up, every mother's son of ye I  Officers, to your stations! Clear all for ac- r tion!" shouted Captain Seth. "Mr. Bunker, t make sail, while I go aloft and see what the stranger looks like."     - 4"Ay, ay, sir; but I'll bet a cookie agin' a darnin' needle she's the Red Rooster I dreamed of!" said the mate, taking off his pea-jacket, and pitching it down the companion-way of the cabin. In a moment, the young Captain-Seth was not over twenty-three or four-had reached the forcyard, with his glass, and now he anx- iously examined the approaching sail. i"Armed, English, and double our own ton- nages " he muttered, as he looked at her. "But no greater odds than that sloop-o'-war we beat off last week; and we've two or three hours of night, yet, to fool him with!" -he added. "I shall pay my compliments to you, Mr. Bull!" When Captain Seth again stood upon tho quarter-deck, everything was clear for action -ach man had a brace of loaded pistols and a cutlas in his belt; the pikes, muskets, and battle-axes, were laid in their places; the guns cast loose; magazine opened; and every man and officer at his quarters. "Elijah, you and Chester must go below, and put on the British uniforms that we took out of that last transport which we captured. I'm agoin' to do the same, and fool -with this fellow till I get him close aboard and under my lee, and then, if he don't smell brimstone, my name isn't Seth Sabberday!" ** Cap'n Seth!" said Bunker, drawing up his lanky figure to Shanghai height and spitting to windward-a thing he never would have done except when deeply agitated--"Cap'n Seth. it goes agin' my grain, awful, to put on King George's livery!" "I 1 can't help that Mfr. Bunker; its policy to do it just now. I'm going to hoist the British flag directly, when she gets close enough to see it, and pass for an English man-o'-war till I get him where I want to, and then I'll broil him on our ' grid-iron."* * The British ed In derision to call our flag the '"Yan- kee Gridiron." They got " done brom ' on it more than oacs, thouga.   "Well, s'pose orders must be 'tended to,'0 growled Bunker. who knew that Captain Seth Lever used the Mr. to him without he meant to be obeyed. Meantime the strange sail advanced so rapiuly that she could be seen plainly from the deck; and soon after the office, s had all donned their British uniforms, she was within less than a mile. "Stand by to fire a windward gun, and bend the English flag on to the ensign halliards," cried Capt. Seth. This was done, and when the other vessel had approached within half a mile, the gun was fired, the colors hoisted, and all sail made -the brigantine being close hauled on a wind. The Englishman had apparently had a care- less look-out, and not seen the Thunberbolt before; for now her helm was put down, and as she luffed, her stun'-sails were taken in, bent in a manner so lubberly that Captain Seth at once said she was either weak-han'ded, or else managed by a skipper that didn't understand his business. The stranger -forged ahead, and sagged to leeward so much, that before his fails were snug, he was in hail of the Anerican vessel. "What brig is that?" cried a voice from his deck, "Iis Brittanie Majesty's brig Spitfire, out of New York on a cruise 1" replied Captain- Seth, through his trumpet. "What ship is that?" "His Majesty's armed transport the Terri- ble!" replied the officer. "What news from New York?" "Good news, sir. Henry Clinton has been giving the Yankee rebels particular thunder at Brooklyn and New York; but he is much in need of ammunition and stores," replied Sabberday. t** le'll be glad to see us, then; we're loaded to the bends with powder, shot, and shell, be- sides a large lot of winter clothing for his men," replied the officer. "' I guess Washington will be the gladdest, old chap," muttered Seth, soto voce; then he shouted again through his trumpet: "If that's the case, I'll keep you company down the coast; the Yankee privateers are swarming at the mouths of their sounds and bays."   "I'm not afraid of them; i carry sixteen guns, and have got a crew of one hundred men," said the Englishman. ' Thank you for the news ; you'll have less in two or three hours," muttered Seth.- Then he added, through his trumpet; "You'd better fill away and- carry sail. I'll keep you company, and come aboard after daylight." "Aye, aye; but we out-sail nearly every- thing we meet; you'll have to crowd the can- vas to keeD up with us," cried the officer, as he put his helm up and bore away. *, So much the better prize for us!" muttered Seth, as he gave orders which placed his brig on the weather-quarter of the Englishman. The latter crowded all sail; but the Thun- derbolt had to take in some, or she would soon have passed and left her astern. "Your craft sails like a witch!" cried tihe British captain. "Where was lie built?" "In Baltimore, I believe. She was a Yan- kee privateer until we captured her,-and hoist- ed the cross of St. George over her," replied Seth, as coolly as if he was not the son of a truth-telling Quakeress. The vessels now bowled off merrily along the coast. with a spanking breeze almost' astern; and by the time the day broke, were weUll own on the Nantucket Banks. 'When the red sun came up from its azure bed in -the east, many a glass was turned from the trans- port toward the brigantine; but her warlike appearances, flag, and the officers conspicuous in their-gaudy uniforms, disarmed the English- man of all suspicion, and Seth, taking every- thing coolly,ordered bhis crew to get their break- fasts as if nothing unusual was about to hap- 1 en. But thcey still kept their arms at hand, and the magazine was not closed. It was about nine o'clock when Capt. Seth, in a low tone, ordered all hands to be ready for boarding, excepit the sail-trimmers and crews of the starboard guns, which had been double- shotted and depressedso as to rake the enemy's deck, and somewhat lessen his means of de.  fence. "You will head the boarders, and board hTim in the smoke, Mr. Parsons," said the captain to "Gentleman Chet-." "I know that kind of work suits you. Elijah, you tittend to the battery and the sails. I elall be where I see myself most needed. Be ool, andwaitforthe   word from me. Have your grappling irons all ready to heave, Mr. Parbons. -Give quarter the minute they ask it, but strike and spare .not till they do!" Seeing that everything was ship-shape, and his own country's flag all ready to take the place of that of St. Georgel Captain Seth turn- ed to the helnlsman.         /  "Port your helm a little." "Port it is, sir." The vessel's bow fell off gracefully, and she forged ahead until she was nearly abeam of the British vessel. "Starboard battery, stand by-port a little more. There! steady," said Seth, in a low but distinct voice. "Look out there, or you'll be aboard of us,". shouted the captain of the English ship. ' Just what I intend to. Down, with that cursed rag, and up with the flag of freedom!" cried Seth. ' In an instant the English flag was lowered from the peak of- the thunderbolt, and the American banner rose in its place. The Englishman shouted "To quarters, men -to quarters!" Starboard  battery give 'em thlunder!" cried Seth,springing to the helm himself. With a deafening concussion which shook the gallant little craft from stem to stern-the wholeb roadside was poured into the devoted ship. The next -instant, amid the smoke and. confusion, and terrible cries from wounded and dying men, the brig crashed against the side of the Englishman, who could fire no gun in return, so sudden and unexpected was the at- tack. "Out grapplers! Boarders, away!" shouted Seth. in a tone of thunder. The clank of the heavy irons was heard--, dusky forms were seen amid the smoke, leap- ing over the black bulwarks of the ship. Then was heard the, clash of steel, the quick, sharp reports of the pistols; shouts and curses, and groans, filled the air, betokening the fearful' struggle going on beneath that sulphurous can. opy  But soon all- was still, except, the moans o the suffering, The,smoke-cloud lifted and re- vealed the gallant Parson's in the act of haul- ing down the flag of those whose boast had everbeen before, that  : "Brittania rules the wave o :J   *J0JJ           JMLa U tj U lJ. .A..A ) The English leader, badly wounded, stood among the few who remained bf his crew, dis- armed like them, and humbled--doubly hum- bled when he saw that his. vessel was far more heavily armed and hlad been better manned than his opponent by twenty-five men. But he could not help himself, and sub- mitted to a transfer to the Thunderbolt with as good a grace as possible, where Captain Seth received him kindly and without any of the insulting bravado which would have pro- bably been awarded to him had he been the captive instead of the captor. ocean burial was now given to the dead, the decks cleared up, a prize crew under Chester Parsons put on board of the Terri- ble, and all sail crowded again, Seth laying his course for the northern entrance of Long Island Sound, he being determined to carry his prize into New London. He had several reasons for this. First, it was the nearest point to the armn  under Washington, which he knew needed the ammunition and stores in his prize-next he wisled to see those whom he most prized of all living beings, and also to gratify his crew,-mist of whom   had shipped from that place. And the eyes of Chester Parsons flashed gladly when he was told what course to steer, for he, too, had an interest in a snug little piece of moveable and loveable property in New London-but of that more, when the right time comes. CHAPTER III. When Ruth reached the house of the widow Hale, she found that lady and her only daugh- ter indeed in a sad state of desolation. And her grief broke out anew when she saw Ruth, who had been dearly loved by her son, al- though the latter had only felt for him a friendly or sisterly affeetion-for her heart's deep, warm, hidden love, had been already given to another. - Do not weep, widow-thee has been sore- ly stricken, but HE chasteneth those whom Ul loveth--HE gave and HE taketh away!" said the gentle girl as- she folded her arms around the bending form of the aged mourner and kissed her pale forehead. "Oh, Ruth-Ruth, it was so cruel to murder him so!" sobbed the widow, and her sobs   were echoed by her sole remaining child-a lovely girl not far from the age of Ruthb "It was a cruel, a base and wicked deed, but the good God will repay them I He is just-we must bow to all his behests and say 'TCHY will, oh Lord, not ours, be done!" "You are a good girl, .Ruth! I try to re- strain my tears, but it seems as if my poor heart would , break.  Nathan was my only hope!" said the widow, striving to cheek her tears. a"He can suffer no more-let us hope that  his spirit rests in heaven!" replied Ruth. And thus, with gentle words, did the young girl, like an angel of comfort, strive to assuage the sorrow which she shared. And well did she succeed. After a stay of an half hour pr more, she brought; in the basket which sh had left with Saul at the door, and then amid thanks and blessings she departed oan her return homeward. Saul, still on his good behaviour, walker, quietly by her side. Suddenly the bqoming of cannonry aroused their attention, and glancing down the harbor, they saw two vessels nundr sail standing up the bay, saluting the town as they came. Ruth instantly recognized her brother's ves- sel as one, and when she saw the English flag beneath the American at the mizzen peak of the other, she knew that a prize had been taken. But there was a tremor in her heart as she gazed upon the ships, for she knew .the perils of war, and did not know who Iad fallen. She loved her brother--dearty Iovpd him I And there was another who had ai l., with that brother for whom she beont hesp kOll in prayer at evening and at. morn, one vIwhol,; name was written on the inner leaves of her pure heart.' It was Chester Parsons. Anxiously she hurried toward her ihomn. Saul, like one half the people of the town, had rushed, shouting, toward the rwharf that front- ed the anchorage, as soon as he recogfnized the Thunderbolt, Not long did sweet Ruth 5ave to wait in suspense, for she had but just reached her mother's side when Seth entered and folded her in his arms.  "Glorious news, dear mother and sister!" he cried. "I've captured a ship of nearly    double jay own force, and she is loaded with ammunition, and such stores as our army are sorely-wanting!" "Did thee lose or take many lives, Seth?" asked his mother, as she returned his em- brace. "Only two killed on our side, and about forty on theirs," was his reply. Seeing the anxious look of Ruth as he mentioned his loss, he added: '"-Don't be seared, sister, Ches- ter is safe. He behaved like a lion, and I put him in command of the prize. You shall see him as soon as duty will permitl" Ruth blushed deeply, but she was relieved from the load upon her heart. "War is a dreadful thingl" said Mrs.:Sab- berday. "Woe to- the tyrant whop has forced -this thing upon a peaoeabile andoG;d-fearing eople!                ... "Hooray for the Thunderbolt-hooray for brother Seth-hooray for everybody s'ept the Britishers!" shouted -Saul, dancing into the room and hurrying up stairs to put on his ac- coutrements. In a few  moments he returned full rigged-rather to the annoyance of his mother. But Seth was used to his vagaries, and spoke kindly to him, at the same time handing him a silver dollar.        i "Oh, golly, how   glad you've made me,  brother Seth!" cried the youth, as he looked at the dollar. "4 Now I've got money enough to buy old blind Jake's bugle- horn, and  1" call it the Trumpet of Zion, and I'll blow a  blast that'll make the Britishers think old Gabriel's comin' 1"  "I wish I had some one to. send with a mes- t sage to General Washington; so that he could r send a detachment after the powder and shot I that I have got, and take care of my prison- I ers!" said Seth. "Oh, let me 'go, brother Seth, let me go!" a cried Saul. "I know that I don't know much, b but you know I was always good to run of b errands! And then I can see brother Simeon C He's there with Gin'ral Washington, at White Plains-a feller that came home sick from the fi camp, told me so yesterday Do let me go;   M I  can get Nathan Hale's horse from  the ei widow, for she'll never use him agin, and Na- h than can't!" "What is the matter with Nathan?" asked  the young commander.   "He has been taken by the British and / 'e hanged as a spy!'" said his sister, sadly. "Ten thousand curise, on the merciless ruf. "fians!" cried Seth, bitterly, for Nathan had - been a school-mate, and a bosom friend. "Seth--Seth-thee must curb thy bitterness t and curse not!" said his mother, reproachfully, e yet in a gentle tone. 3  "How does poor Lizzie and her mother - bear it?" he asked. t  "They take- on a great deal, but I have been e speaking words of comfort to them to-day l" replied Rutlh. i  "Say, brother Seth, aint you goin' to'let me go to the camp with the news P? I can do it as -well as any other he, and it won't cost nothin' if I go" "If your mother will let you. go, I'll write a letter and let you' carry it!" was the reply. ' "Simeon will be glad to hear direct from the family!" "I suppose, as there are no British between us and te camp, that the boy will bel in little danger " said the widow.  "!f he can, as a messenger, be of any service to his country, I am willing he should go 1" "Hooray for brother Seth-hooray for mo- ther!" cried the youth, gladly; "now, sissy dear, you go and borrow the horse for me, while I go and pay old Jake for his bugle- horn!" "I will go, but thee must be more moder-- ate, brother!" said, the gentle Ruth. "Oh, I'll be proper good, sissy-just you get me the horse, and brother Seth, you write the letter!  I'll take it safe to theGin'ral, and maybe he'll give me a real sword " cried the boy, the light of intelligence again beaming in his eye and illuminating his pale face. An hour later, Saul was galloping madly away in a southerly- direction, blowing such blasts on his " trumpet of Zion," as had never before been heard in the streets of that quiet Connecticut town. On--onhe sped with his foaming steed, his fean;hers fluttering in the breeze, and his long wooden sword by his side, blowing his un- earthly blast ever and anon, when he passed a house or met any people, scattering a vague terror through the land, for no one knew whence the wild-looking creature caine, whbither he was bound, or what was his errand. Oi,   through the declining day-on in the red sun- set-on in the gray twilight-on through the darkness of the night, bounded the noble steed and his wild rider!  CHAPTER IV. It was evening, the second evening after Saul Sabberday, well mounted, with a full purse, and a letter for General Washington from Seth, and one from his sister and mother for Simeon, had been dispatched on his errand. The patriot General sat in his tend, with seve- ral maps and many papers spread out on a rough table before him. Antd over these he pored intently with marks of weariness and care upon his noble brow. He was studying out his pathway over the Hudson, or over the frozen clods of Jersey-those clods which, stained with the blood of barefooted and near- ly-naked soldiers, afterward proved their deep devotion to their country and dear freedom's cause. Washington was not alone. Several of his favorite officers were there, either seated on rude camp-stools, or standing in respectful po- eitions near his side. Among them was Simeon Sabberday, one of the Lieutenants of the Life Guard. Washing- ton, whatever were his thoughts and emotions, was never very eommunicative, although he was one of the most courteous of men, and on this occasion, with the exception of asking a few questions about the country, on the route which be was tracing, from those who were ac- quainted with it, he scarcely spoke to those around him. Suddenly a terrific sound, like the blowing of a cracked horn by somne one of great strengthb of lungs, was heard-then the loud challenge of a sentinel, followed an instant after by tihe report of his gun, and then the heavy erash of a horse's steel-shod hoofs at full speed. The horse, foaming and panting, was stopped at the very entrance of the tent, and the next instant Saul, in his strange garb, entered the tent. 1L"Where's Gin'ral Washington?" he asked, as he strode in, covered with dust and sweat. "I am he-what is wanted, young mahn?" saidthe General, and a frown settled on his brow. "You Gin'ral Washington  Why, you're a Ian, like other folks'"   A smile took the place of the frown upon the Chief's brow. He was amused at the sam- plicity of one who had believed him to be more than man. l"Hallo, you there, brother Simeon!" con- tinued Saul. as he saw the Lieutenant. "I've got a letter for you from sissy, but I've got business with Gin'ral Washington. I can't talk to comnmon folks till that is attended -to!" The importance of Saul's tone and the oddity of his rig. brought a peal of laughter from all of the officers, inl spite of the presence of their General, who joined in it as heartily as any of 'them.  "Laughin' 'cause you' never saw a fool be- fore? May be you'll laugh t'other side of your mouths purty soon "' said Saul, as he drew Seth's letter from an inside pocket and handed it to Washington. The latter hastily opened it, and a glad smile illumlinated his countenance, as' he read its contents. "This is indeed good news, and you are a most welcome messenger " said he to Saul. "You shall be well rewarded!" "( I don't want nothin' but somethin' to eat; for me and Nathnan Hale's orse that I've e'en W'most killed ridin' to fast; you see I borrowed , him from the widow lale, 'cause Nathan was hung by the darned Britishers, and can't ride no more! Yes, there's one other thing that I want!" said Saul. "Name it, my brave lad-name it t' said the great Chief.  "Did you hear that, brother Simeon? Gene- ral Washington called me a brave lad. By golly, let nme only have a real sword and I will be one, if I have to chop off fifty Britishers' hands!" said Saul to his brother. Then turn- ing to the General he said: "The thing I wanted to know, Gin ral, was why that sojer feller out there shot at me when I was a ridin' full split to bring you that letter. See here, he's put a hole right spang through my regi- mental hat!"I Saul here exhibited, with the utmost non- ehalance, a hole where the bullet of the senti- nel had pierced his hat. ,I Yon shall have a new hat, but you have run a fearful risk. An inch lower and the bullet would have pierced your brainrl" said Washington.   "They say fools haven't'got any brains!" said Sitneon, in a manner so serious that it completely upset the gravity of the officera once more. "You are no fool, my brave boy-!" said the General, not joining in the1laugh. 'Do you hear that, brother Simeon; the Gin'ral sayvs I'm no fool! Oughtn't he to know?" cried Saul. "Is that young man your brother,- Lien- tenant Sahberday?" asked the Chief. Yes, General; he is unfortunately weak minded, but his heart is in the right place!" replied the officer. "I spe that it is. He has rendered a very important service in bringing me the news of the capture of a large armed transport by your brother Seth, full of that which we much need, muimitions of war. At daybreak you will march with a detachment of mounted men to escort the stores into catip. Meanwhile, take your brother to your quarters and. see that he has every attention paid to his comforts, and see that one of my own grooms takes good care of his horse. You are excused from fur- ther duty to-nighht" "Come along, Saul!" said the Lieutenant. "What about my new hat, Gin'ral? Shall it the milingtary, and have a feather in it and a cockadec " said Saul, not heeding his brother's worda. "Yes," said the General, with a smile. "Come to me- in the morning, and it .shall be attended to; I wish to have a talk with you, and if you are as keen and patriotic as I take you to be, I may have some important service for .ou t!" "D o you hear that, brother Simeon? Gen- eral W SsINGoTON wants to-talk to me! Don't you never call me a fool again; if you do I' ----." What Saul intended to do remains a mystery still, for Simeon literally pulled him out of the tent and took him to his own, at the same time giving orders to have the tired horse attended to. Once in his brothe-rs tent, Saul cooled down, delivered Ruth's letter, and told Simeon all the news about matters at home. He then ate a hearty supper, tumbled down on a camp- bed, and was soon sound asleep, dreaming per- chance of the new hlt and feather which was to grace his head on the morrow    Poor, simple lau. Little did lie think of the weary watchinge; of the prayerful, earnest studies of him upon whom a natio:rs fate de- pended, wlo in deep anxiety was plotting and plannning how to save his almost shattered arimy,.and to check the inroads of a tyrant's mercenary hirelings, upon his native soil. In how many cases do we find the words of the poet verified:  '! Ignorance is bliss It" CHAPTERt, V. The morning sun rose in a cloudless sky. When the first tap of the drum and the 'first- shrill note of the fife commenced the reveille. Saul sprung to his feet and, rnse,sl  into the opeu air. As he looked at the mtnll;itU'ide of tUnts which be had not seen in the, al11-rkiless of t he previous evening, his eyes optlned almost an large as saucers with astonislitnent. and he expressed his wonder with but two words; "Oh, golly!" Just then a bugle joined thfie fifb and drum in the reveille. "Jert salem!" cried Saul'. " guess T cantoot some too!"' And-hoe raisied his ,l 1, I, :,1 to Iis lips and blew such  last tlhat it tattl'eicl the rntire camp from its slumllers iln a h leless tliap tno time, Among those who rushed out, to know the meaning of the unearthly sound, was the Com- mander-in-Chief. 'How now. My young friend? What is the matter?" asked the General. "t What are you blowing?" ,  "That trumpet of Zion am callin' the mur- derin' British ere to judgment, Gin'rl!' replied Saul. Then turning to his tiro!lhr he said: "Did you hear that, brother Slllloerln?  I'Dm Gin ral Washington's youn,., frJiend!" Simegn now. reported to the General that his detachment was ready for the march. -"I hain't got mi y new hat yet!" cried Saul. " Nor I haven't had any brealkfist ; ye't! I can't go!" "You will not go with your brother,'" said i Washington, "I have been thinking 'of you during the night and have service for you You shall have breakfast sent you from my own table, and after that I'll see to the matter I Lieutenant Sabberday, say to the lad's mother   with my respects, that I will take good care of him and hope to return him safely to his home; but that I have need of him for his country's good!" "She will be but too happy if he can be of service to your Excellency!" said Simeon. "And brother Simeon," said Saul, "tell mother, Gin'ral Washington says I'm no fool, but a brave lad and his young friend, and he's goin' to give me a new hat with a cockade and a feather in it, and send me vittels from his own table!" Simeon smiled and turned to go. "Stop a minute-I ain't done yet!" cried Saul. "Tell sister Ruth not to marry Chet Parsons till I come home a real live Gin'ral, mnd tell widow Hale that I'll take good care of Nathan's horse for her. I know you'll go there ; you're so awful sweet on Lizzie!" Simeon, soldier as he was, blushed at this insinuation, and hurriedly mounted his horse, while Saul, by direction of the General, re- turned to his brother's tent to wait for his breakfast. It soon came, and with an appetite freshen- ed by his recent exercise, and the brisk morn- ing air. Saul seat down to its disposal. The way that broiled chicken, hlam and eggs, corn bread and hot coffee disappeared, was a caution to dyspeptics. Before Saul had quite finished all that wa! on the large tray or waiter before him, an orderly appeared with a new Conti- nental hat, handsomely ornamented with a fine ostrich feather and a neat cockade. "Is that for me? Oh, Jerusalem," cried Saul, as he dropped knife and fork. "Oh,jist give me a real sword, and put me at the Britishers!" "His Excellency, the General, wishes to see Mr. Sabberday in his tent after he has break- fasted," said the orderly, and then he saluted Saul and returned to his post. "Be I wakin' or sleepin'? Be I a dreamin? I'll bite my finger and see I Mr. Sabberday- you're a mister already, Saul-you'll be agin'- ral next I Let anybody call me a fool now, and I'll eat him without salt!" After this ebulition, Saul put on his new hat and hurried to the quarters of the commanding gieral. On arving there, he found the noble leader ad two of his most confidential oflieers-one   of them a general, who afterward'proved most ungrateful, and would, if he could have usurp- ed his power, and tried to fill his place. Fill Washington's place! Vain as preposterous-. such an idea! "Have you breakfasted well, my young friend?" asked the General. "Oh, everything was awful good!" replied Saul, snacking his lips over the delicious re- m embranice. "Well, then, you will be able to .talk about business. 1 have marked you closely, and be- lieve that you can keep a secret, and do exactly as you are told to do." "That I can, Gin'ral; that I can!" said Saul, proudly. You wouldn't be afraid to venture into the British camp, and play the fool there, as I di- rect, to get information for me, would you?" "No, Gin'ral-hang me, if I, would. I wouldn't be afraid to go right down below, and take Old Nick by the nose, if you sent me there." "Well, my young friend, I am going to trust you and try you, for I must know what they are doing at New York. To-night,'I will have you conveyed close to their lines. You must then work your rvay into the city, and be as foolish as you please-only eay you've been to my camp, and wanted to be a soldier, but that iy people turned you out of the camp, and laughed at you. They will probablyask you many questions. You must tell them that my army covers acres and acres of ground-  that I have immense magazines of powder and the like,and that I am building houses, to winter here! Do you understand me?" "* I do that, Gin'ral2" said Saul, and so intel- ligent was his look, that no one then would have thought him weak-minded "Anx" continued the General, a I wish you to keepjboth eyes and ears open, and to note in your mind any preparation for marching- see if reinforcements arrive--and, if possible, get the English general to believe that you would willingly play the spy on me for him. By so doing, you may get easy egress from his lines, and here you will find a warm wel- come, whenever, as last evening, you come as a bearer of- good news. Now, do you thor*; oughly understand me?"  I do, Gin'ral; and, if I don't carry out all   you want me to, I'll give you leave to call me a fool again!" said Saul, with an intelligent look. "( But you must keep this fine hat for me-I can't play the fool in it half so well as in t'other one." "True; you hlve more wit, now, than the rest of uas," said the General "You can re- tire, now; and see all that can be seen in the camp. Dinper will be in your brother's tent at twelve. -Come to me at an hour before sunset, and I will give you your final instruc- tions."  The interview was at an end, and the happy Saul sallied fortlhto see the sights. cHaTERI VI., When Lieutenant Simeon Sabberdlay arrived at New  London , with his detachmuent and wagon-train, ready to receive and receipt for the munitions taken by his brother Seth, so that the latter could secure the propert amount of prize-money from the governrment, for him- self and crew, warm was the meeting between the brave patriot brothers. Taller, and even mode muscular and fully developed, than his brother', Simeon looked, in his well-fitting Con- tinental uniform, to be-what he really was- every inch a man! and tender was the greeting which Simeon receved from his fond mother and loving sis- ter. But thelformer, ever as mindful of her unfortunate, as well as her more gifted sons, inquired anxiously for him. "At the desire of the Commander-in-Chief, - who seemed to be much taken witlh him, and thought to make him useful, I left him at the camp," replied Simeon. "And," added he. "the General bade me present his reepects to you, and to say that he would take the best of care of him, and endeavor to restore him in safety to you." "Whatl George Washington send'his re- ipeCts to a poor old widow like me, Simeon  Is thee not mistaken?"- j"No, dear mother. He is one of the best of men, utterly devoid of pride or haughti- ness, and a  Christian in all his ways " I; Then GOD will bless him 1" said the widow. and a   glow of pleasure came out, rosily, on her pale cheek. Simeon now related to his relatives the man- r  in which Saul ha introduced himself to f   Washington. Though the mother and sister turned pale, when they heard how narrowly he had escaped the shot of the sentinel, they could not refrain from laughing heartily at the rest of his adventures-especially his calling the British to judgment with his trumpet of Zion. While they were thus enjoying the narra- tion, Chester Parsons entered; and Simeon, who received him with the warmth of a bro- ther, delivered- Saul's message in regard to himself and Ruth. Both Chesterand Ruth blushed like two schoolchildren caught in the act of kissing each other, by the teacher and Ruth said: Xc Thee has said enough for this time, brother Simeon. Thee had better go over and ee Lizzie Hale, now-she has need enough of thy love and consolation!", "She shall have more!" said Simeon, bit. terly.  "Whenever I again draw my sword in the battle's front, my war-cry shall be--L No than Hile. and vengeance i I have sworn itl" "Thee must not swear, Simeon i Vengeanoe is mine saith the Lord!" said Mrs. Sabberday, solemnly. ,  .;  Simstaon made no reply, but excusing himself to his friends, he hurried away, to visit the stricken one to whom he had long before given his young heart's first and purest love. When he entered the house, a pale, sad,girl, clad in robes of deepest blacr, which cohntreat- ed strongly with her colorless cheek and snowy neck and shoulders, uttered a low cry of joy, and, springing forward, she buried her face in his bosom, while she' clasped her- white arms around his manly form. And there she wept, long and bitterly; nor did he try to check that shower of the heart-storm's rain. He knew that the heart, like a  surcharged cloud, is lightened and brigitened by the tears it sheds, and he let her weep on. At last, however, she became calm, and a sad smile shone out from amid her tears, like sun- ' light coming from beneath a cloud; and then she conducted him to her mother. And then, as a  christian and a soldier--for both can be united, though,alas, theyseldom are-,-he Spoke to both mother and daughter, and counseled resignation to the will of that- indomitable Providence which. in permitting Nathan to die for his country, had so sorely bereaved them.   Oh, it was a g,odly sight, to see that brave e youug eoldier wh6, on the )battle-field, was so  fearless. kneeling there, by the side of that pale N girl and her grieving mother, and asking the I God of the wilow and the fatherless to sup- port thelm in that, their dread hour of tribu- 1 lation. CIIAPTER VII. Sir lIenry Clinton was seated in his com- fortable qluarters opposite to the old "Bowling Green," in, New York, engaged in the truly regal gamLe of chess with Lord Cornwallis, when one of Ili aids entered and said: -If ,oulr l.;xcellency is not too much en- gaged., I Ihl c a curiosity that I would wish to introluce." 4"In what sli,:,', is it, Percy?" asked Clin- ton, as lie madne ;. llove on the board. *"Ques- tionable, or unquestionable?" *"Qurstinniblc. your Excellency. He seems to be a fool, but he may be a knave. But be he either or both, he has recently been in the American camp!, and your Excellency may worm some important news out of him. I found him wandering about the city a laugh- ing-stock for the soldiers and people, and took charg of him" "You were right, quite right, Percy. Bring him to me immediately. Cornwallis, we will defer this gamie for a time," said Clinton, ris- ing, and adding to his cheeks' rich glow by taking a glass of rich Jamaica from the side- board. The aid went out, but soon returned with our hero. Saul. who strutted in, in the full glory of his perforated hat full of cock's feath- ers, and with his wooden sword by his side. "Who are you?" said Sir Henry, sternly. **Siaul %lahberday Who be you, Mr. Su- ernnan?" replied our hero, entirely unabashed "Sir Henry Clinton, commander of the British arlmy!" replied the officer, hardly re- pressing a smile. ** Why, you're only a man, too, like Gencral Wasiington; but ycu amint so big by half a head!" tl You've seen him. then?"' "Guess I have. I wanted to be a sojer, and wear fine clothes, and carry a real sword, like you. and I went to him-like to got killed in doing it. See here, where the darned sojer   shot a hole through my regimental hat 'cause I wouldn't stop when he hollered at me. And what do you think? The darned old cuss- wouldn't have me in his army, so I thought I'd come to York and see if I couldn't do bet- ter on t'other sidel" "You're a fool 1" "So they tell me ;- can't you tell me some- thfin' I don't know?" "Hemp is cheap in these quarters l'i "Is it; then if your gals are good for any- I thing at spinning and weaming, you'll not want for summer trowse  n it gits warm agin!"I   "} "' We use hemp for another purpose!" Do you? What's that?" *' We hang spies with it l" * Spies-what be they?  Anything like dausages? Good to eat, eh? If they are, I want some, for I'm all-fired hungry." At this moment, several general officers en- tered. "Take that fool into the next room, and give him some breakfast," said Sir Henry to his servant; " but keep him there-I wiesh to talk mlore with him as soon as I am disengaged." Saul was conducted into the next room, and a plentiful supply of food placed before him. He appeared to be ravenously hungry, and to devote /' ,f his attention to the disappearing viands ' yet not one word of a very animated conversation and discussion in the next room escaped his listening ear. After awhile, the officers having left, and the breakfast having been disposed of, Saul was recalled into the presence of the British leader. "*How many men had Washington in his camp) when you was there?" asked Sir Henry "I don't know. There were stacks on stacks, and acres ot 'ecm.!losses and cattle, and sheep and hogs, and lots of out-door eel- lars, all brim full of powderl" said Saul. "What were they doing " asked the Gen- eral, fixing his keen eye upon theface of Saul, as if he would read the thoughts expressed there, rather thanf those which came from his lips. d  "Building houses and barns to keep them e and the hosses warm this winter," said Saul, n coolly. r  "Ah I This i# indeed news i" said the GOew   eral, rising and pacing the floor in deep thought. "*So you want to be a soldier, do y6u?" aaid he at last, turning suddenly upon Saul.- "Yes, and to have a real gun that'll go pop, bang! And to have a real toad-sticker, like that one you've got on!" In spite of his dignity and natural hauteur, Clinton laughed heartily at the words and manner of Saul. -  "Keep on a laughin', Gin'ral; folks git fat that laugh," said Saul. "You're like most Yankees, fond of money ; are you not?" asked Clinton. "Don't know ; never had none 'cept a penny now and then to buy ginger cake with on trainin' dny," replied .Saul. "Suppose I should give you a purse of gold en guineas, could you serve me faithfully, and do as I bade you 9?" "Guess I could! But what on earth could I do with go much money?" "Buy yourself a gun and sword, and be- come a soldier for IIis Majesty!" replied the wily general. So I could, so I could," cried Saul, 'eager- ly. * "What d'ye want me to do, Gin'ral 9" I. will tell you this evening. Be here at sunset  There is aiguinea for you to get your dinner with, or anything else you want." "Golly, how it shines!" said Saul, as he clutehecd the golden coin, and backed out from "the presence." CH AfPTIER VI I. 'It was the evening of the twenty-fourth day of October. 1776.  Wa s-hington -was in high spirits, for Lieutenant Simeon Sabherday' had just arrived with a large supply of munitions of war. His officers and men resluted a cheer- fulness that recent unfortunate events had driven- fronm their bearts, and his eagle eye seemed again to pierce the dark cloud, which overhung the lmad that looked to hiw for its salvatio n. "Once more we are ready for the field; let the minions of the tyrant come on!" he said, as he paced to and fro in his marquee. His soliloquy was interrupted by the officer of the guard, who brought with him a prison- er who had bpen arrested in the act of passing the lines. it was Saul. "Here ;s that feel again, yo4r Excellency.!" \ /       *   said theloqicer. He came near being shot, again, as he surely will be, if he doesn't quit his freaks!" "i He is no fool, but a welcome messenger, I hope," said Washington.  "In future give or- ders that lie be allowed to pass in and out Wittlout Interruption." "Do you hearthlt, Mr. Officer? I'm no fooel! Gin'ral Washington says so, and he never lies!" cried Saul, as the astonished officer bow- ed and retired. "Well, my you, friend, what news?" said Washington.  "But perhaps you are hungry and tired, and would like something to eat be  fore you tell me?" "No. Gin'ral, no! I'm hungry as an owl in suOnw time, that's a fact;'but business fust and vittals afterwards. The Biitish have start- ed fromn York, and mean to surprise you, and have a fight in' the mornin'. There's a big/ heap of 'em. and a whole lot of sour-kraut eatin' Hessians.'" "Yonr news is itnplortant, my brave boy I Did you see Sir Henry Clinton?" "T  dill that. -and lie fed me fuist rate, and and then gave me this hag of shinin' guineas to hire me to watch you for him.  I want you to take 'cm. and buy powder to shoot Britishers wilh ; for their gold burns in my pocket, and T won't hl:lve nothin' to do witl it!" ' I'll take it, my brave young friend, and usd it as yo9u wish.'ut Anmerican gold shall sup- ply its place ' You sha1 be none the poorer, for Sour honest patriotism!" replied Washing- ton,- takingr Clinton's purse, but putting a heavier one in Sau's hand. ' The latter eyed it a moment, and then said "Gin'ral, I wi th you'd do somothin' for me? ' What ia it that you wish?" asked the- Gei er al: "I  wish you'd send one of your sojermee home to NIew London with this gold, and tell him to Kgive one half to my mother and t'other half to the Widow Hale. Mother's given away all her money to fit out Simeon and-Seth for the wars, and Widow Hale hasn't got no Na- than to help her!" (' It shall be'done. noble-hearted boy i" said Washington, and a tear actually started, in the great man's eye. "' If Go) has not given thee all the sense that others possess, he has not stinted thee in heart," he added. -   "s And please, Gin'ral. let the sojerman tell mother that [ earned the money-she knows /I wousldn't steal, or lie, except to fool the Bri- tishers. And let him say, please, that I'm doin' my duty, and that you like me." "I will write a letter to her myself, and to that effect," replied Washington. "Jerusalem! Will you, though, Gin'ral? Oh. won't she he glad. She'll do everything but dance, and she'd do that, but she's a Qua- ker. and don't know how." "Well. go to your brothers' tn rt. now l" said Washington  "Go and get come supper -I will write the letter and dispatch the mes- senger-tand then I must prepare to receive my visiters in the morning. Do not mention what you told me to any one else-not even to your brother!" 'Not a word, Gin'ral-not a word  I'll keep as still as a well-fed mouse!" said Saul. And then he added, "'Mayn't I have a real gun aRd fight the Britishers to-morrow, Gin'- ral?" "* No, my hrave boy-to be useful to me, you must keep out of their sight at present, except when you go amongst them as an apparent friend "' -"Well, jist as you say, Gin'ral,. but I should like to have jist ons pop at 'em!" And Saul's face 'wore a look of humorous sorrow as he sauntered off to his brother's, tent to procure refreshments. / CHAPTER IX. All the night long, previous to the dawn of October the 25th, a day which should ever be memorable in the annals of Westchester coun- ty, Washington and his officers were active in their preparations to meet and repulse the foe, which, he learned from other sources than Saul, had been recently strengthened by a large force of Hessians under General Kuy- phausen, and a regiment of Irish cavalry. And when the sun arose on that day, it found the American army strongly posted on the rising ground to the southward and west- ward of the present village of White Plains, his right flank on the Bronx and his left at almost a right angle with his centre. The ground was high and broken, and well calcu. lated for the spirited defence against superior numbersn and discipline, which followed.   On the west side of the Bronx, about a mile from the American camp, the brave General McDougal was stationed with about sixteen hundred men,- many of whom, unfortunately, were raw militia, who had not yet been re- duced to the steadiness of the regulars. He was there stationed to cover the right flank of the patriot army. After a reconnoisance, the British generals determined to force this position, and for that purpose, Coonlel Rahl-who was doomed to fall soon after on the soil which for hire he in- vaded, for he fell at Trenton-was ordered to take McDougal in the rear with his Hessians, - while GeLeral Leslie attacked them in front with a powerful force. Meantime, the booming cannon began to thunder and the hurtling shot to shower heavy and fast upon the American centre. And now, as in many other battles of the Re- volution, a fatal error occurred. A. s his oppo- nents advanced, McDougal threw the raw mili- tia into his front line, where, all unused as they were to standing fire, they had to meet the first shock of the veteran foe. It was -not cowardice, but want of that union which dis- cipline and length of service instils, which caused them, after receiving a single fire, , which was returned with irregularity and but little effect. to retreat, causing confusion and disorder among the regulars in their rear. But the latter were soon in order again, and ' nobly did they strive to retrieve the fortunes of the day. Amid a galling fire from Leslie's brigade, they rushed down the hill, and for a' time swept back the horde of red-coats and Hessians in their front. Colonel Smallwood'fs regiment from Maryland, and Colonel Reitzi- mer's of New york, covered themselves with glory. But, alas! when victory seemed to be theirs, the bugles of Rahl's Hessians sounded in their rear, and they found them- selves almost hemmed in by a merciless foe. There was but one thing for them to do- not to retreat or surrender-for the invincible Putnam had joined them, anud those words were not in his vocabulary-but as the night of a bloody day was drawing on, to effect a juncture with the main army, which they did with but little opposition, for the enemy, to use an old soldier's own expressiovone who aI . .1   was there--had " had their bellies full of fight; a ing for twt day P!"  Night closed in, but Washington slept not. d Seeing the immense superiority of the enemy, he. sent his heavy baggage and stores to a se- e cure position in the rear, and strengthened i his entrenchments so as to be ready for an ex, peated attack in the morning.   '    f But when morning came, the British leader E saw how strongly the American' General was 1 posted, and he dared not attack him until re- inforeed by six strong battalions which were advancing from New York under Lord Percy., This arrived on the thirtieth, and he made arrangements for the assault on the next morn- ing. .But the God' of Battles was with the children of freedom, and the clouds of the en- suing day poured down such floods of rain that the attack was postponed. And in the nightof hat day Washington, as prudent as he was brave, retired with his army about five miles to North Castle, where, in a most advantageous position, he anxiously waited for an assault . - But he waited in vain. The enemy dared not meet him there, but returned down the Hudson, committiug every atrocity as they ,went, and leaving nought but ruin and desola- tion in their track. A few days after, Washington commenced hisn masterly retreat across the Hudson into Jersey on his way toward Philadelphia. There were many incidents worthy of the historian's pen in this battle, which have al- most died away upon the lips of tradition, but one there was, which, as a chronicler of the doings of Saul Sibberday, I cannot omit, When Colonel Smuallwood fell wounded at the head of his gallant -Marylanders, so fierce was the charge of the British. who wished to, capture hinm, that the brave men, almost deci- mated by- death, fell back, and for al moment, deemed their valiant leader lost. But at that instant, a terrible bugle-blast was heard, and with his Continental hat upon his head and a real sabre in his hand, Saul came dashing at full speed upon the foe, blow- ing fearful- blasts upon his trumpet of Zion. Ina moment he was upon the enemy, cutting right and left, and-they, believing him to be a daseling leader of a desperate band of caval- ry, turned and fled. The Continentals rallied,   and Smallwood was saved, while near a dozen of the flying British went to "judgment" un- der Saul's terrific -blows. "Well done, my hero! Well done-you de- serve an epaulet for thati" shouted Putnam, as he rode up and shook Saul by the hand. "Hooray for me!" cried Saul, rising in his stirrups and stroking the mane of the noble steed which once had belonged to Nathan Hale--" hooray for everybody but the red coats. ' Old Put' has called me a hero!" "Yes, and you shall sup with old Putl" said the General, as he gave orders to close in toward the main army. "I speCt the Gin'ral 'll scold me '" said Saul, "for he told me to stay in Simeon's tent; but darn me into Jericho if I 'could, after I heard the shootin' going onl" "I'll make it all right with the General," said Putnam. "Ride along by my side-you deserve the post of honor, for you've saved one of the best and bravest officers in' the army by your courage this day, and I shall tell His'Excellency-of it." "Now don't you, Gin'ral Putnam--'ause he might keep me in, next time," replied Saul. "Old Put" only laughed, and rode on, while Saul proudly took the post of honor assigned to him. CHAPTER X. The Thunderbolt had been in port for near- ly three weeks. During this time, Mr. Elijah ; Bunker had busied himself with such of the crew as he could keep on board in setting up the rigging and reparcelling it, scraping and, t slushing masts and booms, mending sails, e painting the vessel, getting in wood, water, ar and provisions, and completely refitting her. - He was one of that class who was only eon- , tented on ship-board, never cared to visit the shore, and loved to see woman- at a distance, it how far off he cared not, so that she was nst L within hail of him t 1  Judge then the surprise of Captain Seth, - when one evening, as. he was seated in the i. old-fashioned parlor, talki;g to his mother, g while Chester and Ruth were talking in a dis-' a tant corner, Elijah stalked in and seated himn 1- self before him. I,  * What news, Elijah t" he asked   "I' re had a dream," said the officer eolemn- Iy. "So have I had many a one," said Seth, with a gay laugh. "But this was a dream with a sign," con- tinued 'Lijah, earnestly. "A sign eh? Well, let us hear it, 'Lijah." "I dreamed that we was to sea agin," said the mate. "t We was to sea, all fitted out b1e- low and aloft, which we are, and that we were a runuina free in the gulf stream outside of Hatteras, or thereaways, and that'we fell tn with one of the English cruisers, and gave ber one of the darndest lickin's you ever teerd tell of. And when we come to go aboard, after she'd gin in and struck her colors, I thought she was the richest prize we had ever run afoul of-goold in bags and silver in kegs, all to pay off tte troops with-sent from the lnthes." "You're great on dreamns 'Lige!" *:I know that, Cap'n Seth!" repled Elijah, crossing one long leg over the other, and put- ting an,ut a quarter of a pound of tobacco in- side ,f hi s starroard cheek. "And," he con- tinued.- the bcat of it is that my dreams all come trio!   Don't you remember my dream about the chicken fight?" * )it. ytsa-that did come true I Won't you take a glass of cider on the strength of it?" "No, sitnkee; cider doesn't agree with me!" snid the blunt seaman. "Well, I'll see if I can't hunt you up some old Jamaica'" said Seth, rising. "Mother keeps a little in the house as a medicine, I be- lieve!" "Does thee never dream with thy eyes open, friend Elijah?" asked Mrs. Sabberday, wish- ing to occupy Elijah's attention while Seth was gone. "I don' know Iit I do, ma'am!" said - the mate, with rather a roguish look in his eyes, "'specially when young fellers get to forget- tin' among the wimmen folks that they've got other duty aheiA o 'am!"        i And here Elijah glanced at Chester and c Ruth with a   meaning look. But they were 1 too much absorbed with themselves to notice i his words,                I Seth now returned with a  brimming old. 1 fashioned gobltt of Jamaioa rum, which he d handed to Elijah, -vine, at the same time:   "You must have all hands aboard by sun- rise to-morrow, 'Lijah--I'm going to sea again; we've been idle too long now!" "That's the best news)I've heard in a 'coon's age. Here'P to a lualy cruise, and may my dream come true!" cried Elijah, as he emptied the large goblet at a single swallow, first tem- porarily removing his quid. This done, he rose, made an awkward *bow, and retired. Twenty minutes afterward, the crew of the Thunderbolt received the news that they were to sail on the morrow with nine hearty cheers, and Elijah, in the exuberance of his joy, un- locked the spirit room and called all hands to *" splice the main brace," or, in other words, issued an extra ration of grog, that they might' drink a toast similar to that which he had of- fered over the brown and -parkling Jamaica, kept for medicine by the good Widow Sab- Ie rday. True to his promise, though many a tearful eye  witnessed his departure, Captain Seth gailed on the first of the ebb tide the next morning, leaving the Terrible to be sold, and his prize money all to be collected by his prize aecnt. And, when the night time comes, we will fol- low him on his cruise, and see whether Elijah's dream came true. CHAPTER- XI. Never, during the war of the revolution, did the prospects of our country seem so dark as in December, 1776.  Washington had   lost Forts Washington and Lee at and opposite New York; he had literally been chasedacross New Jersey by a-large and well-provided army, flushed with its recent victories, and then, with troops hlalf starved, almost naked, and without tents, forced to cross the Delaware to its western bank. Congress seemed deaf to his appeals for help-tle  militia were deserting by hundreds, and the star of liberty seemed indeed to be entering a cloud whence it never could emerge. Almost any one but that hea- ven-guided leader would have desponded in such a position, but placing his trust in God, he never, for an instant, faltered, or let one of his officers or men observe a single sign of doubt in his serene countenance. And where had Saul been during these long   and hurried marches-these terrible, priva- tions? True to the cause and its leader-more faithful than many who were more gifted than himself-he had clung to the army, and, with his eccentricities and fun, had often cheered up those who were ready to sink under their sufferings. Where was he now in the hour of trialQ Let us see. It was a cold and bitter day, that of Decem- ber the 25th, 1776. And though it was Christ- mas, scant indeed was the cheer in the Ameri- can camp-so scantthat many an one lay down in his tent moanning with hunger, or sat in the rude huts, raised temporarily, and bewailed' ' the darkness which seemed to shroud his na- tive land. It was almost night of. that day, and, as orders had been given for the troops to look to their arms, and extra ammunition had been distributed, and an unusual stir hard been ob- served among the officers, the troops knew that some daring night enterprise was project- ed by their beloyed commander. But he was one who .kept his own counsel, and no one knew, (except a few confidential officers, what his intentions were. The ground was frozen, the weather most inclement, and-aheavy snow- storm was falling. It was near the hour of sunset, though no sun could be seen, when a person came hurry- ing through the storm from the direction of the Delaware. By his dress, he would have Lieen taken for a Jersey Dutchalan-one of tlhe regular sweet cider, sourkroutish sort.' But no oBe could mistake lis face, now, -lighted, as it had been in his great charge at White Ptains, with the fires of intelligetnce and of patriotism It was our hero, Saul Sabberday. "Well, Saul," said the Commasder-in- chief, as he saw him approach the single wail tent, which formed the then "' headquarters of. the army"-" well, Saul, what news? Have you been inside of the enedly's lines?" "Haven't been anywhere else. Gin'ral!"t re- repliedSaul. **And such a drunken set ot cusses asthem Hessians at Trentoln are you never saw! Why, distillery pigs are nowhere with 'em!", - ' Have they no pickets out?" "Pickets, Gin'ral? I didn't see any pickets 'eptin' pict;ket fences!U ' Picket guards, I mean, outside of the town   --patrols to guard them from a surprise!" said the General. (' Never a one did I see, Gin'ral 1" replied Saul. "The drunken Dutchmen have been a singin' songs and dancing all day. They of- ered me just as much cider and beer as I could swill, but though I'm only a fool, they couldn't get none of tfleir drunk-makin' stuff down my gullet!" i"tow many do you think there are in Trenton??" "Nigh on to two thousand, Gin'ral, and some of them same Dutchmen that we fought at White Plains are there. I knowed 'em by tlheir regimentals!" "Gentlemen," said Washington to the of- ficers, who had grouped around him, " this news by our ever-faithful friend but confirms me in my opinions as stated in the council We shall find the enemy unprepared, and thoulshit will be a work of peril and hardship /to cross the river in the face of such a storm, it must he doneI Remember that I lead, and no one should shrink from -hardships or dangers where the Commander-in-Chief leadsl", ' Not one of us will shrink!" cried several of thl chief officers at once. I Washington's face grew bright with enthu- siasm. "Generals Trvine and Qadwallader, put your columns in motion at once!" he cried. "You have your orders; obey tlIem as closely as possible. This night, 'please God, we will strike such a blow as shall make tyrants trem- ble and patriots rejoice throughout all the land!" / Then. turning to one of his staff, he said, "Let the central column, which I shall lead, be ready for tlbe m^rch at once!" ' Doen't start, Gin'ral, till I git my regimen- tals on, and git my sword and them 'ere pis- tols you gave me. It's so all-fired cold to- night that if a feller don't do some fightin', he'll freeze!" cried Saul. "iThere will be time for you to equip your- self, and to get something to eat besides. My, servant will get something for you. And i mark you, my brave lad. keep near my side to night, for I have promised to send you back in safety to your motlher," said Washington. - "Darn the step'll I go till all the fightin' is over, and the Britishers and Hessians run out  *    of the country!" said Saul, as he went after his supper and equipments. It was a fearful night indeed when the head of that patriot column reached the spot select- ed for a crossing. The rapid current of the Delaware was bearing down vastmasses of ice, scarce leaving a spot of open water for the oars and setting poles of the boatmen. The winter wind howled drearily over the plain, and whistled wildly through the reafless tree- tops.. Great flakes of blinding snow filled the air, and the cold benumbed the hands and forms of the soldiers. But not a murmur rose from their lips, even though some were perish- ing,* for their loved leader's eye was on them, he shared each peril and suffered, too, with them. Slowly and with great difficulty, especially with the horses and artillery, the head of .the column was embarked. And then, amid the crashing ice, and the driving snow, and the howling storm, the noble crews of the frail scows struggled against the rushing tide. On- on through the darkness they rowed and pushed, until, through fearful danger, the other shore was gained. The boats thus came and went, until, at last, all of that column was over. Not so fortunate those under the brave Irvine and Cadwallader. They were not des- tined to share in the glories of the coming day -nor could they carry out all of the daring plan of the sagacious chief, who intended to have swept all that Jersey shore that night, and to have struck at three or four different points. He had retreated as far as he intend- ed to, and he was determined to conquer or to die It was a desperate hour, and desperate measures only could succeed. It was three in the morning before all were across, and nearly four o'clock before the column could be got in marching order, amid the terrible storm of snow and hail. But this war of elements seemed to veil the movements of the troops, and when, at eight o'clock, the gallant men reached the town, they found their foes all unprepared. No time was lost, but with loud cheers they rushed to the charge. But springing to their arms, and led by the gray-haired veteran, * Two privates, in that column. wr fixar to doth o that t, ad Trm fVorthl ttaL   Itsbahl, the Hessians offered a bold defense. Yet all in vain. Rahl fell at the head of his men, and they, finding many of their number slain, and all but a few who lad escaped, sur- rounded, threw down their arms and piteously begged for that "quarter" which they' had. never given-they, the base miscreants who bad robbed, murdered, and ravished wherever they went. And mercy was accordt-d to the merciless I Now,how anxiously did Washington wait to hear from the cannon and muskets of Ir- vine. below, and of Cadwallader at Mount Holly. But alas he heard them not-they could not surmount the perils and obstacle) which his mighty will had conquered. And with a powerful and numerous foe very near hiw, and encumbered with over one thousand prisoners, h General had but one course to pursue. He must recross the Delaware and rejoin his other troops-to save Iais prisoners and secure the arms, munitions, and stores which he had captured.  ' CHAPTER XII. "When Seth Sabberday went to sea and was fairly outside, while he was taking his 4* bear- ing and distances" from Block Island and Montauk Point, so as to commence his sea, reckoning, Elijah Bunker came aft; he bad been forward seeing to the securing of the anchors, etc., and said: "Which way be you goin' to put her nose, Cap'n Seth?" "* Off to the eastward, I reckon!" replied Seth. "We may fall in with another of the transports!" "Not in this latitude ; I haven't dreamed o, none!" said Elijah. "But if we run down to Hatteras we'll be spang sure of one!" "Yes, one of their West Indie droghers with Jamaica rum aboard for a courage-feeder to their armies I That rum is what you axe dreaming of, isn't it, Lige P" "Captain Seth, I thought you knew ma better. Haven't we got half a dozen barrels aboard? You know I'm no pig, nor a swill. tub neither t" replied Elijah indignantly. "Pshaw, can't you see through a joke, Lige?' "I ought to, when there's liquor in it, Cap'n Seth; but you know I'rkin d o' touchy,   'specially when rve had a dream with- a sign to, it "- "Well, 'Lige, I'll humor this dreamof yours At the helm there-keep. her away south be west, half west!   Round in the weathel braces, ease up the tacks and head sheets, and stand by to set the larboard stun sailse" I Hurrah for Hatteras and a cord o' prize money!" cried Elijah, as he sprung forward to see these orders executed. Seeing Chester Parsons standing by, the lee gangway, looking sadly toward the land now fading in the blue distance, he said: "Cheer up, Chet; we'll have another prize to send home afore another week, and I won't go in her, you know. You'll see your gal agin soon!" Chester laughed and turned to his duty, yet there was a sadness in his look that spoke of dark forebodings in his heart. Now   with a 'ood fresh breeze from the northward and eastward, covered with can- vas from her deck up to her very-truck, the Thunderbolt dashed off, scattering the white foam far and wide on either side of her sharp bows and leaving a  smooth and snowy wake behind her. ' Her crew gladdened to be once more "On the bosom of the dark blue sea, Their souls as boundless and their hearts as free," worked with alacrity, and Captain Seth had good reason -to he proud of his command. It was the morning of their fourth day out/ and during' all this time they had scarcely bad occasion to raise tack or sheet or touch a brace, but now, suddenly, just as day was breaking,'when they were nearly down  to Cape, Hatteras, the wind died- away and the sails flapped idly against the mast as the vessel pitched and rolled in the heavy swell. "Sail, ho!" shouted the man from the mast- head as the first gray of dawn lighted up the eastern horizon. "My  dream, my dream!" cried Elijah, ex. aitedly, for this was the first vessel they had sightea since they had left port. I  -Where away?" shouted Captain Seth, springing -up from  the cabin where the cheering cry had reached him. "Broad on the Tarboard beam, sir!" "replied the look-out.  **And, bjingo, ther's another,  two more-another on the larboard bow-one  1   , on our quarter--a whole fleet of 'em, sir,'and all square-rigged!", "You can come down from aloft. I can see them from deck, as the liglit lifts!" said Seth, raising his spyglass fo his eye. The inspection did not seem to please him much. for he muttered bitter words while his glass was up, and then-looking all around the horizon as if to note the weather-signs, he said: "Curse such luck! If this calm continues, our chances fora British-prison ship are ninety. nine in a hundred!" i"We'll have wind enough afore long!" said Elijah, pointing to a heavy cloud bank that was rolling up in the south-east. "But what are them .creeters?" pointing to the yessels' which were pitching lazily on:the rolling seas not more than four or five miles distant. "British men-o'-war -   seventy-fours, fri gates, and one sloop-o'-war--seven of 'em, told,'" said Paptain Seth, in a tone whio spoke his dissatisfaction. ," Nothing to do but to run for it, and no wind to run with! There, the bloody sharks have made us out, and their bull dogs have commenced to bark!" This last remark was caused by seeing a puf of smoke blch out from the bow port of the nearest frigate, and soon the booming sound of the gun came down upon the still air. "Let 'em shoot and be damned; no shot can reach us, and it's too rough for boats 1" said Elijah, coolly. ";Where are we?   Can you tell by the land?" asked Seth, glancing at the low sandy beach to the westward of them  "Guess. I can. I used to come down thie 'ere region after turpentine-run more'n five years in that trade," replied Elijah, taking the glass and carefully examining the shore. Having done this, he sprung into .the larboard- main rigging and set his glass on a range of huge breakers which were nearly ahead and all along on the larboard bow. Having satis- fied himself, he sprung'on deck, and said : "  We're in purty considerable of a  scrape, Cap'n Seth, but with sweet lHe and patience, I guess we'll get out of it." "Where arB-we?"1 asked Seth. "In the bite of Hattera,', replied the mate. "Thait'ere pint on the starboard bow is Hat- tera--the Diamond Shoal. is purtty near right *   ahead, and all outside o' that for eight or nine C miles is notlhin' but ragin' breakers."  it liemlamed in, the enemy all around us, and er nothing hut wreck and ruin ahead ; curse your fo dreams!" cried the young captain, bitterly. 'Now don't you take on that 'ere way, r Cap' u Srth," said Elijah ; "I never got a craft i into a fix that I couldn't get her out of. If the c wind comes the way I think it will, and you h jist keep cool, we can show them fellers our I heels easy enough, and maybe set some of 'em E to buttin' their brains out agin Hatteras rfoks.' "What do you mean, 'Lige?" asked Seth, i I a less impatient tone, for he had great confi- dence in the truth and sagacity of his mate. ", Jist this: there's a channel between th6 Diamond Shoal and the pitch of the Cape, with plenty of water ftorus, and skeerse enough for one o' them frigates; besides, it's all-fired crooked, and none too wide for them that don't know it!" - There is no such channel laid down in the chart!" said Chester, who had just come up from examining it. "I don't keer a darn for the chart; it's laid down in my mem'ry box, Chet!" said Elijah. ,' I've been through it when I was a turpen- tiniu', more than twenty times. Old Cap'n Doolittle always beat through there when the wind was light to the southward, 'cause the Gulf Stream runs close into the shoals outside, and 'twas all-nation hard to get round 'cm 1" ' Then all we've got to do is to wait for a breeze and trust to Providence.' Again the nearest frigate, which was not more than three miles distant, fired a gun and showed her colors. The others, too, were signalizing her and she answering. Up with the Yankee flag and cast loose the long gun; she'l heave shot that far, I know. and John Bull hasn't got such a piece in his service," cried Seth. Well might he be proud of that gun. It was ones of those long, bell-muzzled, heavy- breeched brass guns, of Spanish make, which were such favorites with the pirates of a hun- dred years ago, carrying shot to an immense range, and for their weight, most easily man- agtd. * With a cheer loud, and hearty, from all the *rew, the flag was run up to the peak, and At ^      Chester, with the gun's crew, sprung to test it loore, aud slew it around to bear on the enemy, while a quarter-gunner hurried below for more ammunition. In a few moments the gun was ready, and, match in hand, Chester sighted the gun, wait- . ing for the " weather-roll" to send its iron compliments over the rough :waters, to the frigate. The time came-the match was ap- plied, away flew the rude messenger, while Seth watched its effect through his glass. "A trifle too high, Chester," said he. "He'll have to patch his mainsail--ee if you can't hull him." "Aye, aye sir 1" replied the young officer, as he gave orders to reload the gun. The frigate now fired a broadside, but the shot didn't come within a quarter of a mile of the brigantine. Again Chester carefully sighted his gun, having depressed its muzzle slightly, and watching the roll of thevessel as before. fired. , Better-you was into his timber that time!" cried Seth gaily. *' See if you can't knock some of his spars  -aay; if you take the legs out of him, he can't run out of rangei even if the wind should rise!" Shot after shot was fired-sometimes hulling I the frigate, again tearing huge holes in her e sails, again cutting away her shrouds and e stays. "I At her again 1" cried Seth, " the splinters dew from her main-mast that time." M iore carefully than ever did Chester sight his gun for the fire. qne minute later, and tt the tall mainmast of the frigate, with all its ld load of snowy canvas, was seen to slake aml e reel, then down it came, carrying with it ilhd fore and mizzen top-gallant and top-mnmns, ^ leaving her almost a wreck up)on the water "I Peg it into her hbrll now-pay 'eni off f,r ;e Nathan Hale-pay 'em off for Lexington ati,' Concord -  give  'ern parricular fits It shouted Seth. as be rubbed his hands witA y- glee. "Let 'em see thrat we've Yankee light oh ning to send in return for British thunder." a-  Shot after shot was now pitched into tht we dismantled frigate with fearful precipln, ni m- though she still fired an occasional gun, hbe shower could not reach the privateer.  It he seemed as if nothing could save her from be- ad, ing sunk where she lay; but, suddenly, Elijah.   who had -been intently watching the rising bank of clouds before spoken of, said: "* Cap'n Seth, if you want to save you;i light spars, and keep out o' the hands of them fel- lers, to the east'ard there, you better get in your light canvas, and send down the upper- most-spars. It's goin' to blow like fury in less than an hour." Seth glanced quickly at the horizon, and re- plying, ', You're right, 'Lige!" gave the neces- sary orders, but told Chester not to let up on the frigate for a minute, for she seemed to be settling in the water, and he was confident of sinking her. To do so would seem cruel, but when--wen, I ask, did the English ever spare those whom they called rebels? Let the answer come from the lips of shrieking maidens; let the reply come from the spirit of the murdered Hiane --from  Paoli--from  the- Waxbaws -from Monk's Corners-from   the burning villages and desolated homes of Connecticut, New Jersey, South Carolina, and New York! Not an instant too soon did Captain Sabber- day give orders to take in sail and send down his light spars. He had scarcely got every- thing  snug below and aloft, when the huge waves in the distance were seen to be crested with foam. "-Secure the gun--clew up and furl the fore- sail-flatten aft the fore and main trisail and jib sheets!" he shouted, as he saw that in less than five minutes the blow would-be on him. Willing hands and skillful, make quick work, and when, roaring and whistling, throwing the spray up to her very tops, the' gale broke on the Thunderbolt, she was all ready to meet it. Seth cast his glance toward the English fleet, and saw that they, too, were prepared and pre- paring for it, all heading to the southward as if to lay to for it, except the dismantled ves- sel, which kept her canvas on her-that, is all that she could, and lay heading toward the shore, her commander evidently intending to beach her to keep her from going down in deep water. When the wind struck the brigantine, the first blast came with such fearful force that her masts bent like reeds, and her lee bow ani bulwarks were fairly pressed under water, while she lay without motion. But, in an in. stam more, she gatlhred headway, and rising.   dashed forward under her three fore and &f-, sails-the jib, mainsail, and fore-trisail with i maddening speed. 'Seth glanced back towarm the spot where he last seen the frigate which he had been peppering. The storm had pass- ed the spot where she had been, but she was no longer in sight-she had gone down. "4 Soever perish the willing tools of tyrants!" said he, as he took his station by the side of the helmsman. After-the first fierce gust, the gale settled down into a steady blow, and Seth saw that the English fleet, under reefed sails, were haul. ing on a wind in chase of him. This would have been a laughing matter to him if he had only had the weather-guage, but they were all to windward of him, and when once they were around the Hatteras Shoals, they could bear down under flowing sheets and cut him off. "Breakers on   both bows, and  breakers ahead!" shiouted a look-out from forward. "Mr. Bunker, are you sure about that chan- nel?" asked Seth, nervously. "Cap'n Seth, did you ever know me to lie "' asked,Elijah, reproachfully. "Stand by  to put the brig on the other tack. We'll have to get about a  quarter of a mile more to wind- ward, and then we can head through -the first reach.  It'll take about three short tacks to get through, and you mustn't miss stays., either!" "By that time them men-o'-war will be abreast of us, and ready to ease off sheets, and come down   on us while we're hugging the wind to keep off a lee shore." ' Hardly-hardly!" said Elijah, coolly. "In less than two hours we'll be off Ocrakok inlet, and if they'll only try to follow us in there, I'll give 'em all my old clothes. It's the worst bar from  Labrador to Mexico-they'd pile  their bones there before they could spell apple ' sarce." "Look out that you don't pile our bones there. "Never you fear, Cap'n- Seth ;- I didn't go a turpentine huntin' fornothin'-my mem'ry box hasn't got any holes in, it yet, and I ean run her in jist as easy as swallerin' pork and lasses. Ready about-we must go in stay's, sir." - "Ready--ready " cried Seth. In a instant all hands were at their stations.  ,   i t. ut   "Hard a lee P' shouted Elijah. "BUe the jib sheet-flatten in themain,' *ied Seth. The brig swered her helm beautifully, and in a few minutes, wra d44hing ahead on the other taesL It was, however, as Elijah had mid it would be, a short one, and soon they were heading, as it seemed, right in for break- era, that roared as loud as the eannonry of an tidon, while they tossed their smowy drifts high and far on every hand. But steered as EliJ, directed,'the vessel soon entered a chan- nel not more than four or five hundred yards wide, along which she sped, while Beth and his eww looked in fearful wonder upon the walls of foam on either side. Yet there was no dan- ger-the easting of the lead marked four fa- thom beneath her keel. Soon she had to be hove about again, for, she had sagged close down upon the surf to leeward. This was done, until, at last, after her fourth task, she headed for clear water to the south of the shoals, and soon was past all danger, so far as they were concerned. But now, as Seth had feared, the English Yes- Osa of rwa, crowding all the sail they dared, were seen only about seven or eight miles dis- tant bearing down to cut her off. "You may elap the foresail on her if she'll stand it,- Cap'n Seth," said the mate, eoeUy, as he glanced at the meo-of-war. "* She must stand it," said Seth, nervously, a he gave orders to loose and set the asil. "Give her a clear full and lether slide," said Eijah to the helmsman; then, tarning to Seth he added--"Deo't get iato a oonniptien fit, Oapn-if our spars stand, we're as safe as a preacher at a thanksgivia' dinner-they can't overhaul us before we make Oerktok, no way." With more sail and a good full, the gallant "  brigs speed ineread, adsh te memed to:   fairly fly through the water. But the British vessels, carrying a terrible press of canvas, and running off about three or four pointefree, ' were gaining on them in spite of the speed of the Thunderbolt. Their commanders were, evidently, determined to avenge the loss of the frigate. Thus matters went for nearly two hours, when the nearest of the enemy had approach- ed to within less than three miles, and was in easy range of the gun which had been already used with such dread effect on her consort. 1 Stard by to east loose the long gun," Dried Seth; a we may as well bp ready for hard knocks, for that fellow is coming up with us hand over hand." "I guess you'd better let that gun be, with- out you want it pitched overboard, Caps Seth," said the mate, coolly. "In -just three minutes time, I shall up helm, ease off sheets, and put her into the breakers on Oerakok bar. You needn't be skeered, though, for it breaks in four or five fathoms there when ther wind i& to the eastward." Before the time elapsed which he bhad namn- ed, Bunker was off the narrow inlet, and, with perfect ealmnesa, he ordered the helm up, an& put the brig's nose right in for the land through a wild yeast of breakers. A he seid fearful as the danger appeared to be, there. was water enough on the bar, and in as little time as it takes to describe it, the vessel had paeed the bar end shot in behind the lnd, while the baffled men-of-war were obliged tfr haul up and give over the chase. The water inside was as smooth as- glas, and the brig ran up the bay, er sound, for thpre or four miles, and rounding-to behind a pine-covered point, on which three or four wretche   d Ibaeoulde menn, ame tfo a as.   CHAPTER XIII. Immediately after they came to an anchor, the vessel was visited by two of the " natives," who were so unique in dress and appearance, that they- deserve a chapter to themselves. One, by his rig, was evidently a male'; the other, who paddled the canoe, while her lord stood up in the bow, seemed to be of the gen- der feminine, though she wore an old rimless and ragged estraw bat, which appeared to have been "through the wars." - Beneath this streamed a mass of elfish, uncombed red hair, around a scrawny, yellow neck, and over lean shoulders that looked as if soap would be worse thant poison to them. The rest of her -dress consisted of a single gown, brief in length and ecant in width, of the coarse kind of stu1 known as linsey-woolsey. Shoes and stockings she had not, and her horny-looking feet ap- peared to be past the requirements of suick su- perflfities. The man had on a shirt and trowsers oi sim- ilar material, both more " holy than righteous," as Elijalh said, when he'marked their tattered appearance. But his hat capped all the rest- no pun intended, dear reader. It flapping rim -was not leus than a foot wide, and the front of it was pinned baok to the low crown with a rusty fish-hioolk, to keep it from lopping down over hia eyes.- He was as lean and scrawny as the woman. and hoth of them were or a fine suffron color, though they, without doubt, considered, themselves whi'e folks " "Der yer want any terpentine?" drawled the mumn, as he and his companion gained the deck, and looked with wondering eyes and opncu nmouths about the vessel. 1 No. Have you fresh meat or vegetables, here'?" asked Seth, who could hardly help laughing outright at the odd appearance of his listters. ; No fresh meat, 'cept a 'coon or 'possum now an' then," said the man. "4What ar vege- tibles?t" "Potatoes, cabbages, turnips, beets, garden arco and sich like," said Elijah, putting in his oar. ' No, we aren't got- none o' them," drawled the man. "What if0 you raise t" asked Seth. "TerpentiLe?" replied the native. "What do you live on P' asked Seth    "Terpentine!" replied the man. "Have yet got ever a chaw of tohbacy with yer?" Eltiah hauled out a couple of plugs oi res. ular pig-tail, and handed it to him. The man took a bite at one of \ ihe plugs, and then handed it to the woman, who eagerly bit off a chew which -would have astoiished the nerves even of ELijah. "Have yer got a bit o' pork to spare? 11% pay yer in terpentine t" continued the man. Seth ordered the cook to bring up a coupla of chunks of pork;, which he gave to the man,. refusing to accept the reiterated proffer of pay in turpentine. The native now hurried ashore, eviiently hastened by a desire to get some of that pork into his stomach, if there was one in his slabby name. '"What kind of people are they bere. 'Lige P" asked Seth, after the natives had  paddled away.  ./ .  *"Jist as you see; cap'n; the dirtiest. lazeeti,. consarndest fools that ever did live since the deluge. They're too lazy to scratchl when they've got the itch. I'll bet they'll eat that pork raw, to save themselves the trouble ot cooking it. They don't know what oapia,  and never tou 'i water, 'ceptin' they;'re dry, no maore's'as if they bad the bidrofoby!1" And El;jah didn't stretch the truth in his description. CHAPTER XIV.

Therefore, if you please, we will take a long jump over the pathway of time, and come in view again in the month of BaseMBER, 1780. It was in the latter part of this month. The good widow Sabberday and Ruth were engaged with their needlework, seated in the front room of their pleasant but lonely residence, when the sound of a horse's hoofs, clattering drwn the street, at full speed, fell upon their eam. The next instant the wild rider drew up at their door, and Saul, the Idiot Spy, dressed in a complete Continental uniform, with a dashing plume in his Continental hat, and a real sword by his side, rushed into the room. "Why, Saul, Saul, how thee has grown. Where has thee come from, now?"' asked the widow, after she and her daughter had recov- red from the rough but affectionate caresses of the young man. "Don't ask no questions, mother-no ques- tions now; but fix up, you and Ruth, as nice m all creation, for Gin'ral Washington, and brother Simeon, and the Guard, will be here in leas than half an hour, and the Gin'ral is agoin' to stop here all night. I told him he might!" cried Saul, in an important tone, and with an air that brought a smille upon the calm surface of Ruth's face. "What! George Washington coming here?" cried the widow, in surprise. "Yes, mother. He and me have been over to Hartford to see the Count Rochamby, a frog-eatin' Frenchman, that ain't a pinch o' nuff to Washington, nor half a primin' to my friend, Gin'ral Lafayette., "Ruth, daughter, if this is so, we must stir round and make preparation for George and thy brother." "Yes, do, mother; cook up a whole lot o' doughnuts, and ginger eakes, and. pum'kin pis. We never git nothin' o' that sort in the army. Make all ready, while I nde over to he widow Hale's and pay her for Nathan's home. I've got lots of money now, and I wouldn't part with that horse, no way 've 1en in fifty fights with him, and he loves me, ad I love hm. "-   Ad zW  A I-.&   ....  , Before she could reply, Saul was out anld in the saddle again, dashing at full speed toeara the house of the widow, much to the danger of pedestrians, and to the wonder of the staid citizens of the town. Within less than the time that Saul had mentioned, Washington, accompanied by a small detachment of his 1"Life Guard," under the command of Captain Sabberday, for Simeon had earnled and received his promotion for a daring deed performed at Monmouth under the eye of his brave leader, rode nto the town of New London. Directing his men, with the exception of his orderly, to quarter at a tavern, the General rode with Simeon directly to the house of Mrs. Sabberday. He'was received by the latter, whose dress, as well* as that of Ruth, was plain but elegant in its rich material and very simplicity, at the door of the mansion. "Mother, this is General Washington, the Commander-in'Chief of the American army," said Simeon proudly, as they ad- vanced. "I am glad to see thee, friend George, and thou art most welcome; for, though a man of war, thou' art God-fearing and merciful," said the widow, extending her hand, which the General grasped as kindly and as warmly as it was tendered. "To have the good opinion of the excellent mother of such brave sons, is a great pleasure to me," replied the. affable chief, as he followed his hostess into her parlor. When Saul returned, twenty minutes after- wards, he found the General as much at home, and conversing as fieely with his mother, as if he had known her from his boyhood. "Darned the cent would widow Hale take for Nathan's horse," skid Saul, as he enteithL She cried, and said tIe. horse belonged tome nd my country!"  . "She is a noble woman. I must go and see her before I leave, for I esteemed her brave son highly, and sincerely mourned his loss," said Washington. "When must you leave, friend George?" asked Mrs. S&bberday. "Early on the morrow, madam," replied the chief. "I must hasten to West Point, and then turn to the south once morel" "Benedict Arnold, once of this plaoe, orm-   mands there; does he not 9" continued the old lady. "He does," replied Washington. "Ben'dic' Arnold shouldn't, if I was Gin'ral," said Saul, earnestly. "Why should thee speak so, Saul? Did he not fight well in Canada, and when that vile man, Tryon, burned our villages? -and was he not wounded at the taking of Burgoyne?' said the widow, reproachfully. I don't care a copper for all that, mother. I've knowed and watched Ben'dic Arnod ever since he went to school with brother Simeon there. He was always first one side, and then t'other, and went with the strongest party. He would lie and cheat just as quick as he'd Swear, and that was easiei to him than eatin'! He gambled when he wasn't knee-high to a tree-toad, and was always a regular devil after the gals!" "My brother gives a true character of him as he was; but I hope he has, like wine, im- proved with age," said Simeon. Washington listened- gravely to these -re- marks, but made no reply;. and, at this mo- ment, Ruth announced that supper was ready, and the party rose and went into the supper room.  i            v While Washington yet lingered over the fragrant tea and delicious repast prepared by the young Quakeress, the sound of a salute from heavy guns was heard down the bay. "A gulnea to a pound of pork that that's, brother Seth!" shouted Saul, as he sprung. from the table and rushed from the house. And BO it proved to be. Tlhe Thunderbolt was entering the harbor with the fifteenth valuable prize which she had taken during the war. A happy evening was that which was spent in the old mansion, by the General 'and that truly pious and patriotic family; and many and sincere were the compliments paid by the great leader to the mother of such sons, and Saul got his full meed of praime. He had been much improved in his mind, by service and intercourse with men; and, now, any symptoms of idiocy in him were more as- sumed than natural. The visit of Washington to New London created great excitement in the quiet place; but it was of brief duration, for-as he told his hostess the night before-he departed at an   early hour, but not before he had called upon and spoken kind words to the Widow Hale CHAPTER XV.,. It was two days and nighte later. 'General Benedict Arnold was in his breakfast room, with his beautiful wife, his aid, and Colonels Hamilton and Knox. who, having came on in advance of General Washington, from Hart- ford, had informed him that the Commander- in-Chief would visit West Point at- an early hour on that day. While these gentlemen were partaking- of the morning meal, a courier brought a hurried dispatch from Colonel Jameson, who com- manded on the lines below, informing him that a man, who called himself John Anderson, but was evidently a spy, had been taken by three militiamen, and asking what disposition should be made of him. When Arinold read that note, a ghastly pale- ness came over his face, and his strong frame shtook with a terror that never before had un. nerved him-not .in the face of a thousand deaths upon the battle-field. A traitor's fear was on him!    -  "What is the matter, my dear husband?" asked his alarmed wife, while the surprised officers loke their astonishment. Trying, but in vain, to master his agita- tion, a ready lie came to the lips of the second Wee are beggars, with the exception of my pay!" he replied. "Our mansion, with all it contains, in Philadelphia, has been destroyed by firel" "Is-that all?" said the relieved wife. "Then let not that trouble you, for your pay will sapport us with economy; and, so long!las we have honor left, we are not poor!" Oh, how like barbed steel entered that word into his heart from the lips of his true and noble wife. Arnold knew that not a moment was to be lost. If he was arrested, a traitor's shameful doom would inevitably be his. G* Gentlemen, excuse me-my appetite iu, gone; but continue your breakfast. If his Excellency stops here, say to him, if, 5 ou please, that I have gone down to the fortress to prepare for his arrival " said Arnold. /   *YTife. one word with you, in your private apartment, if you please, before I go out lP Mrs. Arnold arose and went with him to her chamber. Closing the door, he turned, and, while the terror-sweat came out thick and cold upon his brow, he told her of his treason and his danger. For an instant, the red blood mantled both her checks and brow, rushing up like a tide of liquid fire; as her husband's infamy was re- vealed. Then it ebbed away, and, cold ann white as snow, with a low moan. she mur- mured--"False to thy God and thy country t" and fell senseless at his feet. A groan of agony burst from his lips, for, with all his faults, he loved her, while he moaned-*- It is too late-it is too late-the &ie is cast--henceforth, remorse and shame ae mine!" Tenderly, he lifted her senseless form upon the couch-pressed one kiss upon her pale lips, dropped one burning tear upon her white eheek, and then rushed from the house. His aid's horse stood ready, saddled, at the door, and upon this he sprung, and drove his spurs rowel-deep into his flaks. With mad reek- Maness, he rode down the hill-side toward the river. Only a few minutes had elapsed, when the Commander in-Chief, attended by his Guard, Ialted at the door of Arnold's quarters. He was told by the officers of his staff, who had Just concluded their repast, that Arnold had gone down to the fortress, and so they sup- posed. Thither he rode at once. But no guard was drawn up there to receive him; Arnold had not been there; the officers of the garrison had not been informed of the approach of Washington. "Where can General Arnold be?" asked the latter, in surprise. Before anv suggestion could be offered in reply, a horseman was seen coming over the little plain. now used as a parade ground by the cadets, at full speed. It was the Idiot Spy. "Well, Saul, what is the matter?' asked the Chief, as the former breathlessly drew up by his Pide.. "Gin'ral, I believe that Ben'die' Arnold is a darned scoundrel!" cried Saul. "I met him a   ridin', as hard as he could canter; down to- ward the river. I hollered at him, but he run his horse all the faster. So I thought I'd see what he was after, and turned my horse's head same way as his. When he got to the river, he jumped off his horse, got into a canoe, and paddled for dear life off to one of John Bull's black-snake lookin' men-of-war that lay be- low!" "God of Heaven, can Arnold be a traitor?', exclaimed the General. At that moment, a soldier, whose horse, covered with foam, betokened the speed with which he came, banded the Chief a package. It was from Jameson, who had discovered that his prisoner was Major Andre, Adjutant Gen- eral of the British army, and it contained the damning proof of Arnold's treassiar. ,netantly, the Chief communicated the in- telligence to his officers-gave orders to double the guards, strengthen the works, and send a light field-battery down the river-bank, to fire on the British ship, where the wretch who' would have betrayed his country had taken refuge. Then, slowly and sadly, he rode back to Arnold's quarters and dismounted. As he en- tered toe house, a woman, lovely even in her wild distress, with a pallid face, dishevelled hair, and eyes swimming in' tears, threw her- self at his feet. It was Arnold's unhappy wife. "'Rise, madam," said the noble Chief, with gentle dignity. "'The wrongs of your hus- band shall not be visited upon your head, for I feel convinced that you did not connive with him to sell your countryl" "I As God is my judge, I did not 1" she ex- claimed. "If I had known it, I would have restrained him from the crime, or slain myself and babe before his face!" i"I believe you would, madam," said Wash- ington. ** Grieve no more; your husband is now beyond our reach. If it is your wish, you shall be sent with a flag to New York to re- join him." The chief now called his staff around him, and gave orders to send for Greene and other generals, preparatory to the trial of Andre as a spy. The history of his trial is a public record; also that of his sentence and death. Historians have eulogised him; poets have lauded him    Bovelista have founded fictions on his brief, but bright career. His qountry has reared a monuiment to his honor among her thousand cenotaphs of heroes. And now pardon me, if I digress from Eng. land's glory to her shame, and give my own neglectful, money-loving countrymen a ,'dig in the ribs" at the same time. Look with me first at the treatment of Na- than Hale. He was simply and plainly a spy -one who risked and lost his young life, in trying to gain information to benefit his ChiieA and country. Yet with no semblance of a trial, treated with every contumely, refused every coumfort, amid jeers and insults, he was strung upon the gallows, and then without a ooffin, and the ignoble rope still around his neck, buried like a dog on the very spot where he suffered. No sympathising hand was stretched toward' Aim, as were many American hands toward Andre, and be htd not striven to buy up traitors from the royal ranks, as had the former. And, Americans-or you who claim to be euch--tell me where is his--whe is Nathau Hale's monument? Where i8 his grave?

Arnold, not so couscious of shame as Judas Isrimot-or  perchance lacking tMae moral , courage to go and hang himself--seemed to be- . come doubly devilish after his fllt, acting after the nainner of Iis great prototype, who is d orthodoxedly supposed. to hold the kevys of the U nether world. In truth, he only gave the reins b to his true character. Washington, who as a I man felt for Andr---though as a soldier and a B patriothe signed his deat- warrat-thuespk e - p of Arnold in a letter about that time, which is o s11 preserved:              i "Atdre," said he. ** has met his fate with that a ortitude, which was to be expected from an tl   f. accomdlished man and a galla t officer; but '1 a am mistaken if at this time Arnold is undergo. i ing the torments of a mental hell. He- wants feeling. From some traits of his character,  which have lately come to my knowledge, he U seemo tG have been so hardened in crime-so lost g to all sense of honori and shame, that, while his faculties still enable him to continue his sordid  pursuits, there will he no time for remorse."  And Hamilt ou. the victim of thelibertine and n incipient fillibuster Aaron Burr, thus wrote of h him about that. day: "This man, Atnold, is in every sense des- picahle.

But the gallant Frenehman-though he treated the  British officer politely who brought it-scorned to even touch the missive penned by the black hearted traitor. But now we conme to the most damning of all his acts 9f infamy. It was the sixth of September, 1781. The darkness of night was fading into the gray of dawn: but in the foggy stillness of thatautumn. al morn. the citizens of New London slept on, little dreaming that a merciless foe was stealing in Upon them,. and that one of their own vil- lage born-a  thief in the night-was hurrying with fire nnd sword to drench their soil ;with blood. and to lay their homes in ashes. The dav-a  day of   herror it was to be,- dawned. and then the hurried tramp of armed men, the galloping of fiery steeds, and the booming of cannonry from 'armed ships in the harbor, roused the wretehed inhabitants to a sense of the fearful peril which environed them on every hand nearly all of the men capable of bearing arms were off with the army, except- ing a small garrison of one hundred and sixty men in Fort Griswold, on    Groton Hill, on the west side of the harbor, under the com.   "iidl of the brave and utfort tiaute Colonel L,-d) ardi.

And. as the sun stole up from the fg'y  east, an immense force was seen fanding west of the town; and soon the grassy .side of Groton Hill was covered with men rushing to-  ward the fort But its brave garrison was not idle,nor stricken into palsy with terror. From its battlements they rained iron hail and leaden balls upon the advancing foe, malking huge lanes in their ranks, until the green hill- side was crimsoned with their blood, and strewed with bodies, still in death, or quiver- ing in its last agonies. More than two hun- dred of them lay upon that slope, yet mad- dened into ferocity, and, like tigers robbed of their young, thirsting for revenge on-on they (ashed I Col.

Ten to one against the hapless garrison, they are led on by an officer whom the British records do not even asme, so dastardly was his conduct when, at lat, he entered the little fort.

Nw, up from the lovely village, across the little harbor, rises the shouts of a licentious soldiery, let loose by the fiendish renegade, to the abuse of shrieking women and helpless children. And, s0oon up from  the white houses, from mansion and from cottage, roll great black clouds of smoke, and thenared tongues of flane darted toward the skies  Oh, man--mant when thou hast fallen, how devilish thlln ait Yet. err I not, when I call Benedict Arnold a rwan? At the first alarm, the Widow Hale and her daughter Lizzie flew to the house of their best friend. Mrs. Sabberday. But woe foirthem- Simeon and Saul were with Washington, far away to the soutlhward; Seth and Chester were at sea-they were four defenceless wo- men.  Yet kneeling on a floor which soon was to be a burning sheet of fire, those eged matrons bent in prayer, while their lovely daughters, who had sad cause to fear a fate far worse than death, shuddered and trembled, clasped all tearfully in eaeh other's arms. Suddenly, hoarse shouts are heard before their door-rough steps upon their threshold, and the room is half filled with a rude gang of half-drunken, all-beastly soldiers. "Here's a prize for us!" shouts one, -as he springs forward toward Ruth, whose piercing shriek rends the air, as she shrinks behind the towering form of her brave mother, who, pale apd calm, but with an eye that gleams like fire, rises from her knees, andieries:   "Baer, ye sons of the Evil One, back! Sthrink back, before Jehovah in his wrath smites ye in your sins i" For an instant they quailed, but it was only for an instant. "Down with the old ones-let's have the girls " shouted one of the most reckless. Again the licentious and heartless crew werb advancing, when an officer, blackened With smoke, and bearing a sword reeking with human gore, stalked into the room, followed ,by several others whose uniforms, rather than their looks or conduct, told that they held commissions in the army of a nation that pro- fessed to be civilized. "Ah, ha-whom have we here?" he said, with a sneer, while the lawless soldiery fell back in the presence of their .general, and Went in search of other prey. "Whom have wre here?

"Never while I live " cried the undaunted mother of Ruth, seizing a heavy oaken chair. and raising, asif it was a feather, she whirled it around her head, and added, 'if thee ad. vanees one step, I will brain the on the spotl" But the brave old lady was no match for those strong men-the chair was wrenched from her grasp, and Arnold with his clenched hand, struck the hapless woman down, while his minions dragged the fainting, shrieking   girls away. Mrs. Hale fainted as she moaned out-"Oh, God, my daughter, tool" When Mrs. Sabberday came to her conscious- ness, she rose covered with the blood which flowed from mouth and nostrils--blood frotm Arnold's blow-and dragged the still insensi- ble Widow Hale from amid the flames of her burning house. Their children were gone, and there they stood, two lone and desolate widows, amid the burning embers of their once lonely vil- lage, while the ruthless spoilers sailed away from their shores with that- which they held most precious, in their power. CHAPTER XVIt. Ever memorable in true American hearts is the nineteenth day of October, 1781. On that day, tlord Cornwallis surrendered with nearly eight thousand veteran soldiers, at Yorktown, after a defence of unparalleled obstinacy. And during the long siege, in sorties and attacks. the Americans, as if punishing- their enemies with kindness, made no retaliation for the das- tardly butcheries at Fort Griswold and New London, but with the utmost humanity spared all who asked for quarter. It was a proud day for us--one most hu-: miliating to the haughty Britons, far more humiliating then the surrender of Burgoyne. But modestly did Washington bear his honors, giving far more credit to his French allies and his own brave officers than he took unto himself. Only one thing did he deeply regret. By a condition in the terms of his capitula- tion, the intention of which was not under- stood until too late, the infamous Arnold was allowed to escape in a eartel to New York. It was midnight. All was still in the camp,- except the trambp of the sentinels, or the guard upon its rounds, for the. fatigued army slept-slept sweetly in the arms of victory. But he, who was mightiest of them all, whose long-cherished hope of securing an honorable peace for his country, seemed about to be ret alized, slept not. He sat in his marquee, surrounded by his favorite officers, glancing over his maps and meditating where to strike another terrifi blow-to shake-a tyrant'e throne. -  Suddenly, led in by an officer who coromnikid- o E    ed a ldietalt picket. there entered a pale, gaunt w,lltanl. Whose almost skeleton frame seemed about to Bink with the weight of fatigue. The dust of travel lay thick upon her form, and her wan face bore the marks of sufferings too intense to be faithfully descried. '*Merciful God, it is my motherl" cried Simeon Sahherday, as he sprung forward and caught her in his arms. "My son," she moaned, and then for a time she knew no more, for nature gave way, and she fainted. Quickly a surgeon was at hand, and restor. atives were applied. And the Commander.-in Chief all full of tenderness, in word and deed, assisted. When she recovered, she looked wildly around until her ele met the well-known face of Washington. "Oh, save my child-my poor Ruth!" she moaned. Washington knew not what she meant, for althoughl he had been informed of Arnold's hase anld murderous expedition against New London. he knew not of minor particulars, nor did Simeon or Saul, for their whole atten- tion and duty had been claimed in the severe services of' that eventful campaign. But a thrill of horror went to every heart, when Mrs. Sahhrday, strengthened by the restora- tives, tolt how her daughter had been torn from her Pine, herself stricken down by the misereast's hand, and what she dreaded was, or would be, the fate of poor Ruth and Lizzie. Excuse a momentary digression-the chap- Ur wouldu't be worth an old-fashioned cent without it It was the day after the surren- der of Cornwallis. The weather was clear, and the fresh wind blew cheerily from the westward. A brigantine, under a full spread of canvas, was standing to the northward from Cape Henry, evidently with the intention of cutting off a large British transport, which with her national colors flying, was standing out from the mouth of the Chesepeake. The brigantine, which was none other than our old friend the Thunderbolt, carried Amer- an colors.  8he was fully cleared for action, and   her glorifying crew were exulting in the hope of making another prize, and Elijah was   t just relating his last dream to Captain Seth, d when up went a white flag at the fore truel e of the transport, and she bore away toward 1 the brigantine, seeking to meet, ratherthan to D avoid her. This madlauvre rather astonished Seth, but I keeping his men at their quarters, ready for instant action, he bore away and soon was in hail of the Englishman. In reply to his ques-  tions, the British Captain announced that Lord J Cornwillas had surrendered to General Wash- ington, and that his vessel with a free pass from the American General, was a cartel to convey sundry persons set free in the capitu- lation, and also the news of the surrender, to, New York. * Seeing, is believing," said Soth, as le or- dered the Englishman to heave to that he might examine his papers. Accompanied by Chester Parsons, Captain Seth was soon ou board of the transport. One of the first persons whom his eye rested upon was Benedict Arnold. With a look of bitter contempt, he turned away from him, to look at the papers of the British officer. Arnold, unabashed by his look of aversion, approach- ed him, and addressed him by naume. "Open not yo'lr lips to me, you black- hearted traitor!" said Seth, bitterly, "Were you not protected by this pass from his Ex- cellenox, George Washington, which guaran- tees the safety of all on board this vessel, I would take you on board of my brig and swing you by the neck from her yard-arm-- then'I'd cut it off and cast it in the sea for having been contaminated by your touch 1"  4 Prate on, boy, prate on! You'll sing a -different tune when you reach New London 1" said the renegade with a sneer. "'What of New London?" asked Chester Parsons, with a quivering lip, for a fearful boding of evil seemed to fall like ice upon his heart. "Ask Ruth Sabberday!" said Arnold with a coarse laugh, as he entered the cabin. Captain Seth now returned to his vessel, and made all sail up the Chesepeake, wishing to see' his brother Simeon and Saul, and to communicate with Washington. Haa he or Chester Parsons known all, Benedict Arnold then and there would have reped the reward of his iniquity. But it was not so to be.   CHAPTER XSVTl. When poor Ruth and Lizzie recovered from  the almost deathly swoon which had deprived I them of consciousness; when they were drag.  ged from their mothers-they found them- selves in the after cabin of a British armld i transport, far out at sea. Captain Crabtree had faithfully performed the-orders of Arnold so far, and his vessel under a heavy press of sail was heading away for the Bermuda Isles. i "Oh mercy, Rutlh! what shall we do?-.; what shall we do?" moaned Lizzie Hale, as ' with tears and sobs she threw her fair arn, s arotund the neck of her companion in distress ', Put, our trust in God, Lizzie! He Swill ,.-' desert the helpless, who are pure in heart. and whose prayers go up to HM in. the hour of trial l" responded Ruth who, though pale, as drifting snow, was yet calm a' Rather than be what that bold, bad, trai- torous man would make me, I will cast myself' into the sea!" sobbed Lizzie. : Thou hast no right to take thy life, Li;:- lie," eaid the young Quakeress; " but if th-c( puts thy trust in the All Powerful, fear niot that the wicked man shall triumph I I know that we are in the power of bad men now, but yet my heart shrinks not, nor is my srul afraid.' /' Oh, that I had your bravery, Ruth; but I have suffered so much in the loss of my only brother, that I am all unnerved, and a very child now." A step was heard, advancing from the outer cabin, and the next moment Captain Crabtree entered His name was rather indicative of his ap- pearance-perhaps of his character. He was a short, rough, knotty-lookiag  customer, whose face, ,bronzed by rum and hard wea- ' ther, was Tickly pitted with marks of the small pox. A red pimple, of the genus pug, ocupied the place of a nose, and its bridge, if ever it had possessed one, had been carried away by a sabre-cut, leaving a red ravine or soar through which his cross-eyes of gray could look at each other and exchange corn' pliments. His general appearance was repul. sive, and he did not add to it by either the leanliness or quality of his apparel. 'Young women," said he, "it's nigh our grub time, or, as you say ashore, near supper /          time.- I have orders to see to your comfort as ar as I can, and keep you safe till the General gets, time to look after you himself. Will y,11n ave supper here, or eat with me and my uites in the cabin?" "If we are to be detained in thy vessel; and must perforce eat or perish, let the food be brought hither. In our distress, we court solitude; and do not wish to see either thee or thy mates," said Ruth, with calm dignity. The face of Crabtree darkened. * Some women don't know what good com- pany is, and get set up tauter than a Jamaky nigger in uniform," he muttered, as he-turned on the broad pivot of his immense feet, and left the cabin. ** How dare you speak so boldly to this man? It made me tremble to look at him," saidi Lizzie. "Tihe innocent should never tremble before tlhe ungodly," said Ruth. "But rather should they be hold, and the ungodly will fear to wrong the m.11"  t A cabin boy, a trifle blacker than ebony, and shining like a newly blacked boot, now entered with a tray full bf eatibles, such as was more suited to the taste and appetites of rough men than delicate women, but strong tea was not forgotten, and of this and the hard sea-biscuit, Ruth began to partake. "Thee must eat Lizzie," said she to her oom- panion, who drew back from the untempting. meal. "It is thy duty to do it, so as to keep thy strength, for I tell thee, that the moment an opportunity offers, I'shall strive to escape from this unjust restraint, and I will not go without thee.' *Thus urged, and perchance encouraged by the hope which ner brave friend aroused in her breast, Lizzie ate all that she could. * What a horrible, ugly wretch that captain is," said Lizzie, after they had finished their meal. "* He is not comely to look upon, but he looks well enough to be the slave of so base a master," replied Ruth. "Benedict Arnold is not quite' such a beast in face and form ; but I'll warrant that he is more rotten at the core." "You ladies are very complimentary," growled Crabtree, who had been standing at the door, unobserved by them. ("Thee has learned a lesson said guth   tartly. "Listeners never hear any good of themselves." "I'm thinking you'll haul in some of your canvas by and by, young woman, and not be quite so free with your tongue,' said he in a rage, as he turned away and slammed the door behind him, finding it all in vain to try to get on terms of conversational intimacy with his unhappy prisoners. In truth they were soon so. afflicted with seasickness, that had they even been willing to have endured his company, they could not. Days passed, and though they had been in- formed that they might take the air on deck, the two girls did not leave their cabin until the cry of" land, ho, " was heard, but remained there praying for God to help them, and to sustain their afflicted mothers, who were m ournipg far away. But when that cry reached their ears, Ruth said: "Lizzie, let us go up and look at the land; and mark thee, Lizzie, note all that thy eye rests upon, for as surely as the Lord liveth, I shall attempt to escape with the first chance that offers:" To those who had never seen the richness of a tropical growth, or of a land 'so far to the south as Bermuda, though it is not strictly within the tropics, especially after a long sea- voyage, the sight of towering trees of broad- leafed green, and fields of flowers and vines, would be most agreeable, if they were not, like those poor girls, prisoners, reserved for a fate, perchance far, far more dreadful than death itself. The vessel sailed on, and soon Ruth and Lizzie saw  a small scattered town of white- i washed houses rising from  amid the field of green and gold and crimson before them. In front of it was a small harbor, in which only a few small fishing  boats lay at anchor, or a moored alongside of one or two small piers of i stone that jutted from the shore.  The harbor was not entirely land-locked, but t a natural breakwater, or reef of coral, stretched a nearly across its mouth.  As  the transport t began to have eail taken in, and entered the bhanel whbich led through the reef to the har- 1 bor, Crabtree approached the girls who stood a near the taffrail, and sid, as he pointed to the  largest house in view, one which was fronted  by  a broad esplande, and which was sur.   i. i) va IU ampu   OJMu I r. f rounded by a garden that extended down to the water's edge. "There, young women, is General Arnold's house. He bought it to live in, I'm thinking, after the rebels have been thrashed into sub- mission '" Then it will be some time before he dwells there," said Ruth. "I s Mrs. Arnold there?" asked Lizzie, timidly. *"Thunder, no Do you suppose he'd be such a bloody fool as to send her off to his pleasure-house to get her jealousy-tacks aboard with the sight of such good-looking girls as you? She's in New York," replied Crabtree, going forward to superintend the preparation for coming to an anchor. "Merciful heavens, what shall we do?" moaned Lizzie. i"Hist, child, don't be a baby i" said Ruth. "We shall escape-already my plan is formed. God will not desert us."   - * Brave, dear Ruth, oh, that I bad your nerve," sighed the fair girl as she twined her arm around the slender waist of the young Quakerees. The vessel soon rounded too, her sails were clewed up, and then as her headway ceased, the splash of her heavy anchor as it dropped from the bows, and the rattling of her chain as it ran through the hawse-hole, announced that she was at her moorings. After the sails were furled a boat was lower- ed, and Crabtree, with his two captives, was anded. On the shore they were met hby a lot of tan-colored Bermudans, big and little, of both sexes; who, though there was no pity in their looks, stared upon the shrinking girls as if they never had seen a lady-a white lady, at least- before. Crabtree hurried the girls up to the house, which they found to be completely furnished, and stocked with servants, and there put them in charge of a major domo, or steward, giving strict orders that they should not be permit. ted to pass from the house without attendants, and then on no account to let them go beyond the grounds. "Young women t" said he, "as long as you behave yourselves quiet, you won't be looked up, nor anything of that sort; but I shall only put sentries around the grounds to clap grap nels on you if you try to escape, which you n yoeant do, for you'll find no friends hem "   1 We have a friend here who is more power- ful than thee and all thy host," said Ruth, firmly. ," The deuce you have," cried Crabtree' in alarm ,' Who is he-?i' !"One whom thee will never see-Almighty God,!" replied the Quakeress, scarcely able to repress a smile at his alarm. "Oh!" said he, and he seemed to feel re, lieved with the ejaculation, as he turned away and left tM e girls -by themselves.' ' You said that you, had formed a plan of escape." said Lizzie to Ruth. when they were alon "I have," replied Ruth, "and when- the right tunme comes, I will tell thee of it. Mean- time make thyself comfortable ; seem easy so as to disarm suspicion, .and eat all that thee- cau to gain strength, for the,executionw of. my plan will require courage, strength, and forti-. tude!" -CHAPTER, XIX. It was the evening of the day-or rather the afternoon of the day-after Mrs. Sabberday's arrival in the camp of Washington. The fa- tigue of her journey, made alone and almost entirely on foot-for the raid of Arnold had left her entirely penniless as well as homeless, as was the ease, too, with her friends and neigh- bors-had so worn upon the pbor old lady that she was now dangerously ill. Washington, with his best surgeons, and the noble hearted Dr.; Craik. his own family phy- sieian. and him who afterwards attendee the bedside of the,expiring Chief in his dying. hour, was unremitting in his attentions to the good lady. Her sons, Simeon and Saul, were there, bhut the former was impatient to at once fit out an expedition to attempt the rescue of his sis- ter and his betrothed. But here was a difficulty. There were, no American vessels in the river, and General Washington did not feel justified in requesting his French naval allies to go on an expedition which  as'-not essentially for the public ser- vice. While he was pondering upon some means of acceding to the wishes of his favorite officer, a salute was heard, appearing to come from some vessel just coming up the river. Saul sprung out the moment he heard it,.bui   in a few minutes he returned, exhibiting signs of the most extravagant joy. "Hooray for brother Seth," he cried; "It's the Thunderbolt'!" "If that is so," said the Chief, with a look of pleasure, lighting up his noble face. " your desires ean be accomplished at once. You may add thirty or forty- picked men to his crew, and, as I am told, they have- but few men on those Islands, trusting to their fleets for proteetion, you may succeed in rescuing the poor girls from the power of that arch fiend, ere it is too late." "A thousand thanks, my General," said Simeon, warmly, and he pressed the hand ofi the man of men. to his lips. "The God of the' widow and the orphan bless thee," murmured the feeble invalid. "Let me but see my child in safety and my country free, and I will close my eyes and say, now, Lord, letest thou thy servant depart in peace." Seth Sabberday did not wait until. his eails were furled after he' came to an anchor, but hurried at once with Chester to the head-quar- ters of the victorious general.   i Words can scarcely express his -surprise when he found his mother therei nor the hor- ror and indignation of himself and Chester, when they heard of the destruction of their native town, and the abduction of the poor girls. ' Hurry aboard, and have the sails loosed and the cable hove short. Tell Mr. Bunker that we will sail within an hour. Send a boat ashore for a few more casks of fresh water, and I will go off in it," said Seth to his second officer, who hurried away to obey the orders. , "Any ammunition or stores that you re- quire shall be supplied from my camp, Cap- [tain Sabberday," said Washington. " Your brother Simeon will join you with forty picked men, who, though they may be of little use in navigating, your vessel, will be efficient on shore or at close quarters as marksmen, or witi the bayonet." "You're not going to keep me. and ,my trumpet o' Zion from going, are your" said Saul, who did not like the idea of 'being left behind. ' I think it,will be best for you to stay with :your mother, and I may yet haveneed of you," eaid the General, kindly.   The youth said no more. Washington was his god-hiz will, Saul'8 law.  'It did not take long for Simeon to pick his  men. for in a service like that, volunteers were j plenty. More provisions were put on board, with the water, and within an hour the Thun- derbolt, under all the canvas which she could st. was beating. down the river, on her way once more to the ocean. And woe betide the foe that crossed her heows then, for burning hearts make strong armn, and there were those on board that craft who had out little thought of merey left with- in their breasts. The spirit of revenge, born of the remembrance of their wrongs, was pent up there, and it only needed the presence of those who bed done those wrongs, to leap madly forth and -satiate even to gluttony its fell deaires. CHAPTER XX Day after day, and weeks, passed most drear- ily to the poor girls, who hoped even almost against a chance of hope, that they might be rescned from their peril. But no rescue came, though they were not yet doomed to see the hated Arnold, for he was still too busy in the service of the king unto whom he had sold his body-his soul was engaged below I ** It looks as if a terrible storm was rising," mid Lizzie, one evening, as she and Ruth were walking in the garden alone, for so quiet had been their behaviour. and so resigned did they seem to their fate, that the attendants and guards seemed to relax much in their watch- lness, though Crabtree, whose vessel still lay in the harbor, visited them daily, and an- noyed them by informing them that he ex- pected the General every hour. ' I hope that the looks of the weather will not be belied by it," said Ruth. "I have only been waiting for a dark and stormy night to put in execution my plan for our escape." "Do tell me your plan, dear Ruth. I am no longer the nervous child that I was. Your bravery and faith have strengthened me, and I am ready to dare and meet any peril with you." "- Does thee see those small fishing sloops that are moored eaeh night to those wharTes, after the fishermen return from the shoals and   reefs where they fiash in the day time?" asked i Ruth. "I do," replied Lizzie. i "Well," said the Quakeress, "I intend to steal away in the darkness from this house when the servants sleep, avoiding the senti- nels, for we know where they are posted, and then seizing one of those vessels to put to sea and strive to reach the American shore, which must be to the west of us." "What, go to sea in one of those' small I boats in a storm? We surely will perish." "* Had thee not rather perish in striving no- bly to escape, than to become the lemnn of Benedict Arnold?" said Ruth almost sternly. "Yea, a thousand times yes, dear Ruth," re- plied Lizzie. "* But how will we know how to steer-how to manage the boat? '"Thee has seen me often sailing with my brothers in New London harbor, Lizzie, yea, and alone, for that matter. As for our course, I have secured a small compass, and soxne provisions, and deadly weapons, too. if we are imperilled by lawless men, though. the Lord forbid we should shed blood, save in defence of our honor, which is still dearer than life." ' "And all this you have done without my knowledge?" "Yes, for while thee was so hysterical and nervons, I dared not trust thee. But thou wert right about the weather, Lizzie; a storm is surely rising  There seems to be. t0. smartest boat, at theoend of the first pier, and only one man in it-a colored man, for I have watched him and his boat often when he cnme in.

Crabtree would remain on board to see to the safety of his craft. In truthhe was-one of those thorough sea-dogs who, considered himself safer on board ship in a gale than ashore,!ke the sailor who in a terrific blow at sea, which -had dismantled his ship, pitied the folks ashore, who had bricks and tiles flying about their heads. It was near midnight when the girls, be- lieviang all to be asleep in the house, began to prepare for atheir attempt. As yet the storm had not broken, though the heavens were hung in pitchy, black, and each instant it seemed as if they would open with their awful artillery. Ruth drew from a dark corner of a closet a large basket, containing wine- and provisions, and also two belts in which were fastened two braces of pistols and two daggers or dirks of the kind need hy English midshipmen.' She also produced ammunition, and flint, iand steel, and the precious compass. "I wish that I had a chart of the American coast," she said, '"but I could not obtain one. We must e'en do the best we can without. I. know  that, by steering to the westward, we hall fall in with the American coast some-  v where IP The weapon-belts were now buckled on, and wrapping their mantles closely around them, the brave'girls left their room with steps so stealthy that. no sound reached the ears of those about ,the house. Out into the pitchy gloom they went, taking their course by the ight which glimmered at the peak of the trans- port, and moving with slow caution' so as to avoid, the sentinels who were posted between them land the wharf they sought to gain.  It- ook them, a long time to do this; but at' last,   -by the occasional glimmer of lightning in the distant clouds, they saw that they were byr the side of the vessel which they intended to board. It took but an instant for them to get into the little sloop, which was about half decked over forward, though entirely open aft. She had two sails only, a jib and mainsail, and Ruth, casting off the fastening from the wharf, quietly pushed the boars head toward the sea -and then hoisted both sails, ready for the wind when it should come. The negro's snoring could be distinctly heard from his little,berth beneath the foreastle deck, so that the} were assured'that he had not awakened to endanger, their safety by giving the alarm., At last, though it seemed a very long time before it canoe, the roar- of the tempest was heard, and, admonished of its force by the sounds, Ruth, who had learned thoroughly the management of a boat from her brothers, v lowered and close-reefed the mainsail, and then 'taking her station at the helm. she awaited its coming.          , It came, and scanty as was their sail, the slender mast bent like a hoop-pole before its terrific strength, while the little sloop in the smooth water, for the wind was off shore, darted forward like a hound slipped from its leash.  And the clouds, which before had low-- e ered so dark and heavy, seemed to be rent in a. thousand fragments by the incessant bolts of' lightning, and in- hoarse bellowings, like dying, giants, to thunder forth their cries of di'so- lutaon. On past the transport. whose look-out did I not seem to see her, for no nailing cry was ' heard, the frailboat sped-on. Outover the foam- ing reefs, she flew, and soon was in the open sea; but so heavily raged the storm that Ruth dared not at once take her lourse, but luffed up all she could to keep under the lee of the land, running to the southward, in the smooth water, as close fo the shore as she could.. So far she had not dared to light the little lantern with which she had provided herself, but as soon as an outjutting and precipitous headland concealed the light'of the transport  from  view, the lantern wasw produced and lighted, and held by Lizzie so that Ruth eould i see her compass-for though the vivid light; ning at one moment blazed over land and sea the next i instant all would be darknessa, whUla   the sir seemed to quiver with the beavy thnder. But a moment after the lantern waa lighted, L4gie uttered a cry of terror and it nealy dropped from her hand. The black and scarred face of a hideous looking negro man was peer- big out from beneath the forecast., and with great red and white eyes he glared upon them, seeming to meditate a spring upon them, for in one hand he held a huge knife, while hia other great black paw was already, stretched outside of the forecastle, as if to aid him for- ward. Seeing that he was discovered, he scrNabled out, knife in hand, but in a second two pistols were levelled at his head, and he ceme too on all fours, rather suddenly, as Ruth said in a cler, calm voice: "If thee moves another inch, thee dies i" "Oh, Gor amighty--don'tshootold niggerf* said the black, shaking with terror. "Cast that knife overboard!" said the Quakereas The negro hesitated, but when he saw the fair finger of the brave girl pressing on the trigger of the pistol, he sullenly obeyed. "Can thee swim?" asked Ruth, as she marked his ferocious visage, and knew that it would not be safe to keep him on boarl. t Yis, missy, all same like a black-duck i" "What did this boat cost thee?" she con- tinued. "No  osso nigger nothin'-picked 'em up adrifft" replied the black. "Then take this l" said Ruth, tossing him four or five pieces of goli&-"and now let me eas thee swim 1" The negro hesitated again, and seemed once *more to meditate a forcible recovery of his boat Ruth's voice was louder and her look darker as she said: "Overboard with thee, or I will so disable thee that thou eanst not swim i" 'Her alear blue eye glanced over the levelled tube of death-he saw that he must obey or d, so casting his glance toward the dark efifa, landward, he put the geld in his mouth, and in an instant was strngglimg in the water. Day had now begun to break, and'before the sloop had goe a half mile further Ruth saw a the negro had gained the shore and was ambing up the reky ll C   The brave girls now inspected theforeastle, or at least Lizzie did, while Ruth remained at the helm, and they were rejoiced to find several breakers or small kegs 4f fresh waterand some coarse provaisons there; also cooking utensils 'and a large quantity of excellent fishing- tackle. '.If we do not perish in the storm, we shall not starve, for a long time at least 1" said she as she announced her discoveries./ *"We must endure the perils of the storm- I must steer to the west and get away from the land!" said Ruth. "If weare seen, the report will speedily reach our enemies and better will it be to be swallowed up by the wavea, than to be retaken by them!" She now put up her helm, and with her compass for a guide, she boldly turned her prow out upon the heaving, foaming sea. 'As the boat sped out from the influence of the shore, the force of the gale was so heavy that they had to lower and secure their mainsail and scud under the jib alone. This had been scarcely done, when an ex-. clamation 'from Lizzie aroused Ruth's atten- tion. The former pointed to a large vessel, apparently square rigged, which seeted to be stapding in toward the harbor from whieh they had escaped. "Arnold must be on board of that vesselsl' said Lizzie. "If he is, God is very good, for we are be- yond the villian's reach 1" replied Ruth, again glancing at her compass, while the sloop aped on with increased velocity before the gale. "Yes, the vessels are saluting!" eontinued Lizzie as the faint sound of distant ennovnry was heard. "k Of course they always salute an officer of his rank!"        , On before the howling gale--on ovar ti(e great foam-capped seas, now perched :upon their white creste, then diving down into their shadowy valleys, flew the little boat, andqon the land was lost to view, and no sound save that of wind and waves fell upon their earn The waves would sometimes curl in over the low stern of the boat, but Lizaie, now as calm and joyous as she before had been nervous!nd1 dispirited, bailed it out, and sung cheering songs to Ruth, who, intent on the dutiea of. navigation,'kept steadily at hb  pot, C   CHAPTER XXI. On the dawn of the,third day, after they left the Chesepeake Bay;-the hearts of the officers of the Thunderbolt were gladdened by the cry of "land, ho," from the "look-out" aloft., In ,a few momenta Seth was at thW mast- head with his spy-glass, and there he remained 'for a considerable length of time, giving a new course to Ahe helmsman,; and occupied in clobsly examining the land which they were rapidly closing in to. When he came on, deck again, he gave orers at once to clear ship for action. "What did you 'ee, Seth?" asked, Simeon. '"*The, harbor that we seek, I,think,'" replied i the young captain, "' with an English vesiel in it! I shall hoist English colors, and run her' aboard. and after I've taken her, we can man- age matters ashore between us, I reckon!" "Does the place seem  to be fortified?" asked Simeon, "I saw nothing that looked like a fort, from aloft; but we can tell iri less than an hour, for we'll be close in, by that time, with this breeze i" replied Seth. He then gave orders for the men to get their breakfasts speedily, so as to be ready for work. when the time came. The brigantine ran rapidly on, and by the time that the men had finished breakfast, and got the vessel in fighting trim, she was so, near the harbor that the people on shore could be plainly seen as well aa those on the trans- port. There seemed to be an unusual stir ashore -people were'moving hurridly to and fro, or standing in groups there, and boats were pass- ing to and from the transport. On hoard the latter, there, ow appeered to be considerable stir. Her sails were suddenly. loosed, and she appeared to be getting under- way; but as the Thunderbolt neared the har- bor with English colors at her gaff, the sails of the transport were refurled. Butt her crew soemed still busy, and Seth' watehed their occupation from the foretop with greatanui- By heaven's they're clearing for action, and getting 'springs on their cable to Jay her broadside to us!" he cried.

With a terrible son- cussion the .whole double-shotted broadside was poured into the doomed Englihminan,t- pistol shot distance, tearing huge 'holes in his bulwarks, and doing dreadul havoc on his deck.,              - ,   - "Clew up the topaail-down, jib and 1na-r sail-prepare to board i" shouted Seth again and the next moment, by asking ifuliturn,ofL4D   him, he laid his brig athwart the hause of the Mmy. In a moment Simeon and Chester, heading thi boarders, sprung upon the deck of the rmnsport. There were but few left to meet Chem, but Crabtree, who was about as brave a he was ugly, fought with the ferocity of a tiger, until a blow from the heavy cutlas of Chester Parsons lopped his right arm off, as dean as if a surgeon had amputated it, and then seeing that most of his crew were down or had fled below, he aried, "Enough, enough Ibr ete, and be d--d to you 1" The English flag was hauled down, and the Amerioan run up, and then Seth, seeing that the people on shore were trying to bring a ouple of guns into battery on him, disen- tangled his vessel from the transport, anchored er head ad stemr so " to bring her broad- adO to bear, and sent a charge of grape canister among the gunners ashore, that at them flying in every direction. Seeing that he was not likely to be troubled more fom that direction, he turned his attention to the wounded and prisoners-using them as he ever did, with the utmost humanity. When Crabtree was brought to him, he waited until the wounds of the English ostcer were dressed, and he strengthened by two or three glasses of old rum before he asked a question. When he did, he asked; 4"Were you at the saeking and burning of few London, by Benedict Arnold t': "Yes " said the wounded Crabtree, dog- adly. uThen perhaps you man inform me what be- mae of two young ladies that were torn from their homes on that occasion, and sent to this iland by Arnold P' "Yes; I broughbt them here in my ehip, bat they escaped last night in a fishing-boat, d where they are in such a storm " blows outside now, is more than either of us can "Bware, air, how you deceive me. Are tihose ladies on shore now in one of those w t" said Seth, sternly.  "I'm i no mood for lying now-I've told Imothe truthi I was about to get underway } go in march of tiem, when you hove in s,  v d I Imn you, for you ut out a vessel ' f   the fet that I came over from England   with, right under the noses of our convoy, and run her in through Martha's Vineyard, a year or more ago!" 1"So we did ; but. sir, I shall send a party ashore to inquire further, and make search!" , Dr you please; but it you feel any inter- est in them young wowen, you'd better be look- ing outside 'for them before they go down. The boat they took is a frail thing-not more than two tons measurement, and all open aft--you can question the nigger that owned her. They made him jump overboard and swim ashore- . he says they'd 'lave shot him if he hadn't." '* My own' brave sister-I knew she had grit 1" said Seth. "Plenty of it, if the Quaker owl is your sis. ter 1" said Crabtree, groaning as lie glanced at' the stump of his sword-arm. "Young man," added he to Chester, " you strike heavy 1" ," So do all the foes of tyrants, when they strike in freedom's glorious cause 1" replied Chester.  Seth now dispatched Simeon ashore With a large party, to make search and inquiry, and at once occupied his other men and officers in getting both vessels ready for sea again as soon as possible, for he was determined, with one vessel, to scour the entire Bermuda ooast, hoping that the girls might have run into some small inlet or bay, and knowing that if they saw their country's flag on the,' Thunderbolt, which they knew, they would run out to her, or show signal. With the other he intended Chester to cruise in the gulf stream between the Island and the American coast, in hopes-to fall in with them, if they yet lived, and were steering to the westward. The addition to his own crew, made by Simeon's men, enabled him to retain enough to fight his own vessel, and to put a good work ing crew on board of the transport. The return of Simeon from shore, with the reports and information gathered there, satis- fied Seth that Crabtree had, not deiaeved him, and as soon as he could get the vessels ready, anchor was weighed, sail was made, and they headed out for blue water. Yet so great had the damage been to the transport, and so much had she to be repaired in hull, spars, and rigging, that it was almost night when they cleared the reef outside. Giv.   ing Chester his orders, and appointing a ren- dezvous, to meet-in a week's time on the Ame- rican coast, the one to wait for the other till she came, Seth laid his course down the coast of the Island. The orders were, with both vessels, to show blue lights frequently during the night, send up rockets, fire a gun at, least once an hour, and to keep a constant look out in every direc- tion. Nothing was to be left undone that could lead to the discovery of the poor girls. Yet, when Seth got outside, and found how heavily the gale blew, and how fearfully high the sea rolled, he scarcely dared to hope that a frail sloop, so small and open, and manned- excuse the Irishism, reader-by two weak wo- men, dould live through it. Yet be had been taught by his pious mnother to trust in the goodness of God, and many a silenut prayer went up from his lip to that throne which all can approach. Had those poor girls only known when they saw that vessel steering for the harbor in the morning, that it was the .Thunderbolt, how quickly would they have returned, and how gladly spring to the arms of those who sought 'them. But it was not so to be. CHAPTER XXII. On through the long day, with unabated speed, few the little' sloop, Ruth scarce for a moment leaving the helm, though once in a while she would let Lizzie-take it while she rested and partook of some little refreshment. On over the great blue waves, amid the foam and the toppling surges--their mast bending as the full sail distended to the gale. Not a sail in sight, not- a spee but the clouds, above, on which their eyes could rest-all else a boundless circle, with its verge ever receding as they advanced. As nig ht darkeded in, the wind seemed to fall alie, and Ruth managed to get a close reefed mainsail on the boat, and having lighted' her lante, she kept her course tolerably steady, although, with the wind nearly astern, and a aomnps  unsteady  from the- constant motion of so ^all a vessel, which was yawing and veering alI the time,it was difficult to- keep hei entirely steady, On through the darkness of -the night,-no tdeep coming to their eyelids--on for another X .    day, -and for yet another night, and the poor girls began to suffer dreadfully, not from hun- [ ger or thirst, but for want of rest, for they ; were all unused to such terrible toil and hard- ship, such long unrest, such constant vigils r and ceaseless watchings. In truth, hardy I must be the Tman who could'endure them. On for yet another day, and poor Ruth be- gan to fear that she could not live to see the l!and. Her head began to grow dizzy, her strength to fail, her heart to sink. But now Lizzie's courage seemed to increase. She took the helm, and forced Ruth to lie down and sleep, after she had taken some of the wine which they had provided. Ruth slept for at least three or four- hours, and awoke, relieved and refreshed. "Let me' take the helm now, dear child," said she, as she rose from the blanket on which she had reclined. "Hist!" said Lizzie. "Heard ye nothing strange?" Ruth listened a moment, and then said; "Yes, I surely hear the beating of surf upon the shore I It must be that I Yes,'see there is a light s of a fire a-head of us. We must take in our sail-or the jib at least, and lay too until the moon rises, lest we be wrecked in the surf, or cast among those who are foes, :for I know not what shore we have come upon." Ruth soon had the vessel heading sea-ward, and laying too, and now, with gentle force, she made Lizzie lay down, as she had done, to sleep. The wind had died away into a gentle breeze, and now  she had nothing to do but keep the helm alee, and let the little boat come up and fall off as the sail filled or shook. And she gazed up in the starry sky, and thought of home, of her poor mother, and of her braves and manly brothers, and -wondered whether. they, too, were not gazing sadly on the same stars as herself. And  then anon, while the boat rocked so gently, she fell asleep and dreamed-dreamed of her girlish days, of the merry sports on the village green, when herw heart and feet were light as fa bird's in the glad spring time. And she dreamed of the young lover who had won her pure heart's first re- gard-again she saw   his manly form, and heard his low, thrilling voice, as he voted to love her, and  her only, for evermore. And'-   then, li ke rosy cloud in a summer sky, the vision pawed on, and a wild and terrible dream Uurped its place. What it was, she scarcely' Ifew ; a vague terror. all undefined, filled her hert, and seemed to palsy every faculty, while terrible shrieks and yells, as if hellws de. mons ad been let loose upon tie earth, filled her ears. 8he oke--and the last vision was no dream -the yells and shouts rung out fearfully on the morning air, for it was day, and the sun was ruing bright above the eastern horizon.  But a fearful eight met her eyes-they had soaped a terrible daoger, for the boat had drifted between heavy breakers into the nar- now mouth of a river-yet the worst danger wa yet to eome. A large band of half naked avages were shtuting and yelling on the shore, exulting over the prize which they deemed the winds and waves had brought them. Ruth instantly awakened Lizzie, who utter ed a scream of terror, she saw the yelling band, and moaned: *"Oh., Heavenly Father, have we escaped the perils of the storm, and dangers of the sem, to meet a fate more fearful still t'" (Yield not to fear,"' aid Ruth, who, though dreadfully terrified at first, now regained her usual serenity. "*God has not deserted us yet, nor will he now I Look to thy arms, and ff we must land, do not separate thyself from M' for an instant 1" . , The boat was now slowly drifting with tie Ud  up the river, and Ruth lowered the sails, sid dropped the anchor, so that it could not drift any further. The poor maidens now lanoed around them, and examined their situ. ation. The river was narrow, aud bordered on either side by groves of lofty, flowering trees. rght grases and lovely flowers grew down o the water   very edge.  Gay p imaged Eirda flew frbm tree to tree, and filled the air with melody melody only disturbed by the ellsb of the uncouth creatures on the shore. ad itnotheen for timin their hideous reality. tey could have almost faneled that they had come upon some fairy land. But suddenly the yelling crowd became aoent--drew bw&, and eeaed their wild ges- reua. The cause was "on apparent  A per    son, copper-colored like themselves, but an almost gigantic height, strode, with a slow and dignified step, through the crowd, and, ad* vanQing to the beach, viewed the boat with the appearance of intense interest. He held a long spear in his hand, and at his baok a bow was strang, also a quiver full of arrows. Over his form a mantle ot gaily colored feathers was east, and above his dark brow a circlet of crimson plumes arose. Down his back hin hair hung in a long and jetty mass. His feea tures did not seem ferocious, but yet, when he beckoned, and made gestures for the girls to come on shore, they feared to do so, and stood trembling in their boat, with their arms twined about each other's slender forms, praying for a wind which would enable'them once more to put to sea, and, steering northward, to find some of their own race, to whom they could speak, and who might pity their distress. ', Where can- we be?" asked Lizzie. "Somewhere on the coast of Florida, I ex- pect," said Ruth. "Yonder flowery shore answers to the' descriptions which I have read of the land, and as yet, with the exception Of a few small Spanish towers, itis only inhabited by Indians. .We should have steered more to the north, and we should have reached the shoros of Georgia or the Carolinas." "Do you think  that these Indians speak Spanish?" asked Lizzie. * Perhaps some of them do!" replied Ruth. *, Oh, I hope so," said Lizzie, "for I studied it to please my brother, for he spoke it well; If we can but let them know who we are, and promise large rewards, perhaps they will treat us well, and help to restore us to our riends." ' It may be so," said Ruth with a sigl, and a desponding look. The chief, for such he evidently was, by the deference and respect showed to him by the other Indians, seeing that his friendly signals did not indue  the girls to go ashore, gave orders to one or two of the men about his pe-r son. They started off at full speed, upon what errand the unhappy girls knew not. Bat soon-not more than an    half hour later at least-they were seen paddling doWn the river in a light canoe, which they had brought from  above somewhere.  Ruth ad Lizzie breathed a silent prayer, grasped their- weapons, and awaited-they knew not whar&   UOte Indias did not steer toward the eloopc but lsnded at the shore where the chief was pacing to and fro. When the prow of the canoe touched -the shore, he thrust his spear upright into the ground, took off his bow and quiver, and laid them down, then gathered a bunch of snow-white flowers, and stepping into the caaoe alone, he paddled off toward tai boat.  " He comes unarmed, and, by the tokens he brings, it would seem as a friend," said Rluthb "God grant he does 1" sighed Lizzie. "His untenance does not seem terrible." The distance was not great, and, soon the eiietf* canoe was by the side of their little. vessel. .With an air of calm dignity, he stepped- on board, and after regarding them intently for a moment, divided his bunch of flowers, nd gave an equal portion to each, at the same tiie saying something in a language which, though they could not understand it, seemed soft and' musical. * "Speak to him in Spanish, Lizzie--per chance he may understand thee," said Ruth. Lizzie did so, and a thrill of hope- rushed tirough her pulses, and deep into her despair. ing heart. when he replied in that tongue with an ease and fluency which bespoke him a mas. ter of the language. "Where are we?" was her first question, in that sweet tongue which the Castillians say- "-s la leugua de Dios y de las Amores"-the language of God and the loves. "In the land of the Seminoles; and I'am f Imathla their hief!" 'was the chieftain's  proud reply. ' Who are ye, and whence did , ye come F" "Two hapless maidens, fleeing from cruel,  enemies." was her answer. "Come to the lodge of Emathla-his war- I ridre are many and brave, and the foes of the t itle 'fed maidens will never dare to seek them there I1" replied the chief.  '"Our mothers weep for us as those who are lost to them forever. We would go back to g our homes, and tnake their hearts glad once b "Ore," said Lizzie,- pleadingly.      t ' "Itie good-but you are weak and weary, a Tl'h viage of Emathla is not distant; he-will n guide this bot to the landing-place, and his ,s notnor i auaCtnted with ,everal Indian tone, -r' was nFue s ustoatl as dth et 014e 0emhio'. i   3i women shall give the maidens food, and they s  shall eat and grow strong-they shall sleep, e and they wiii he weary no more." r  Lizzie told Ruth what the chief had said, d aun asked what she should reply. Buth a Ipaused a moment, and studied the expression otf Emathla's face. It seemed noble and free d from guile--yet she did. not like the expression of un1disguised admirationwhich he cast upon B Lizzie; who, if possible, was more beautiful titrld himself i  *"We will trust him and go," she said at last. ,* We need rest, and perchance if weO place confidenceo in him, and offer large reward "for his services, he will, from pride or interest, aid us to go to some civilized place, whencewe can reach those whom we love." Lizzie turned and told the chief that her sio. tr was willing, and they would go. A light breeze was blowing up the strteam, anuu the chief, having fasterned his canoe astern of the sloop. went and raised the anchor, and hoisted the sails in a manner which showed that he wasI not entirely unused to the maw age met of boats of that kind. The boat now iroved gently up the river, ateered by-his hano, while, with shouts appa, rently O"' gladnaes. - although they were wild and uncouth, the body of Indians on shore- ran along the ballks of the stream. The scenery, as they advance, grew more and more beautiful. The banks were more preci- pitous, yet they were'covered with flowers and fruits - the .magnolia, the cactus in every variety, wild pinks and roses-grapes, oranges and lemons.-seeming ready to- drop from vine and tree in. their delicious ripeness. In spite of their fatigue, and the fears which their situ- ation would naturally create in the- breasts ot helpless females, the maidens could not repress their looks and words of admiration, as .they gazed on seenes' more bright than ever they had seen before.          . . The keen eye of the chief noticed this, and it glittered with pleasure the while. Perchance he thoughtthat tnidl such enchanting ehnes the lovely girls might forget their more bleak- and barren northern homes, and the loved ones mourning there.  The boat pd o n, d o on ar rived o pposit laoge, level plain, upon which stood thou. sands of the brod-spreadg, gnarled, and fin,   tavtie looking lite-oaks. wliclh. witlh white munves pudau t from tceir traucles t setred to toe hnng witi banners. All underhrush had )a eulltiely removed, aud houses built of )les curiously inteftw iled, aud thatched with the great leaves of the Palroetto, were seen on evet-  baud. And tureugh the avenues and paths, beaten hard by the tread of nmany feet, came troop upon troop ot Indians, men and women. maidens and boys, and children j'ist able to totter along by the side of their mo- thers, to see the pale-faced guests of their ohief.  a the diatanoe, groves of oranges. lehmons, gsava and limes, ounld be seen. and wide fields if corn. hannaase, plantains, tobacco, ete, imet the eye. And in the green eavannas, gunarded by the Indian herdsmen. droves of cattle and horses could ht seen grazing. One dwelling, far larger than all the rest, stood near the waterside. To it the haughty ebieftain pointed and said: *' Behold the home of Emathla!"And then, spreading out his armse, as if to show their vast extent, he added : * Look upon the peo- pie and the possessions of the chief of the Seminoles " ' Soon they arrived opposite the house of Ematha and with a skillful turnm of the helm, he luffed the little sloop up alongside of a lit, tie pier that had been built out from the 'hore, altost under the eaves of the dwelling. Then be lowered .the sails, and carefully fastened the boat to the shore. His people erowded down upou the bank, "a if they would examine the boas and its fair navigators more losfely, but a word and a gesture from the chief eaused them to fall tack, and they did not approach the boat again.  With all the courtesy which might be ex* pItod from an accomplished cavalier, rather than an untutored son of the forest, Emathla now assisted Litie and Ruth to land. and led them within his dwelling. It had a most airy, and yet, for such a clime, where chilling blasts sad wintry frosts were all unknown, a most comfortable appearance.* It was divided into several apartments, and into one of these,   where 'couches of soft mosses were covered with lawk-skilts and soft furs. and blankets of gay featherm, the two nisidena were conducted and hithtr Emathha called his women to wait upon aud se rve them. These brought water in gourds and hathed the acsolig feet and lim;bs of their fair visitera, or guests, and then they brought theml cooked meats and fish, and fruits of many kinds, and also strewed the ground with tragrant flowers, which sent up delicious odlora on the balmy air. One there was, who, though she did no work, lingered with a sad but curious air almolg the rest, and 'gazed with great eager eyes of softr and jetty black upon the pale- faced girls. She was not near so dark as the  others, seemed quite 'yotmng, not more than fourteen or fifteen years of age, and was very beautiful. "Who art thou?" asked Lizzie in Spanish. "*lLnlinas, the daughter of Ematfila," said the maiden, timidly. Then she added, and her face wore a very sad expression as she spoke-- "My mother has gone up to the spirit land, where she' waits for her child." 4 Thy mother was not of the. Seminoles?', continued Lizzie. No--thhe red man's blood ran not in her veins-ahe was the daughter of the Spaniard'l" replied trie chieftain s daughter. And now Lizzie wondered no more at the chief's having learned to speak the Spanish tongue so well. * But the chief now entered, and the'child drew back and spoke no more. -- Let the pale-faced maidens sleep," said the chief -."* Emathla will see that no danger wakes them," and pointing .to a pouoh, he turned away and left them, dropping a screen of teathers which hid them- from the other rooms as he passed out. Wearied, and trusting to ,the God who had so far wonderfully protected and brought them through perils, the tired girls lay down, elmaped in'each other's arms, and soon were in that almost death like. lumber which is the result of weariness, and strength far 'over- taxed.   APTER XXIII. Anothr . day hes dawned, before Ruth and ol Lizzie aw-,e. for long deprivation from rest, and great t^igue, had bound the chains of br slumber strong about them. When they first i opened their eyes, they were quite startled to t observe the tall form of Emathla standing'  near them. His arms were folded across hi g expansive ehest, and his eyes fixed intently t upon them. But they felt reassured, when a gentle smile stole out o his dark face, and he b said to Lizzie, "The pale-faced maidens have slept well. They will soon' grow strong t again!" ' \nd then he went out nd sent in his women, . who  ain brought water and washed them,  and thn brought them food. But they looked s invain his morning for 3,ulionas-he came  not with the rest. Lizzie and Ruth both re- r gretted this; for, having white blood in her veins, and speaking in a language which Liz- zie could understand, she seemed to be a link between them and civilization, and they felt more safe when shewas near. Why she came  not, they could not learn, for none of the other women spoke other language than-their own, and though they watched every, look of the girls, and strove to gratify their every wish, they spoke not, but performed their labor in silenee, Again they strewed the ground with fresh lowers, which were so fragrant and so lovely, that it set med as if it were almost a sin to have plucked them from their stems. After the women had departed, Emathla en- tared, bearing flowers even more delicate and beautiful than those which they had seen be- fore, and these he gave to them, asking, at the same time, if there was aught else which he could do to add to their comfort or happiness Lizzie interpreted his words to Ruth. i Tell him," said the latter, "that though we ae grateful for his kindness, we would not tarry long here, for our mothers may die of grief while we linger. Tell him that if he will guide ustoward the white settlement we will give him much gold, and after we have returned to our homes, we will send him ric presents, and forever after, so long as we live willpray to the Great Spirit to bless nd prosper him." ' uie spoke as Ruth desired.   A look of impatience gathered upon the ohieftain' lofty brow, and heanswered: "Let the maidens rest and gather strength before they leave the lodge of Emathla. He is a great chief, and will shelter them until they are strong, and able to go upon their journey. And when they go, he will be their guide. for so wills the Great Spirit who sent them to hs cave." "Where is the chieftain's daughter, the beautiful Luliena?' asked Lizzie, timidly. The frown on Eretthla's brow grew so dark, that Lizzie almost tremble4 when he replied: She is but a ohild--he hsth too long * tongue, and is not fitting to k-ep com"'any with those who are wiser thhn shb. I have sent her to learn wisdom from olM veuen, by keeping her ears and eyes open, and her mouth shut," replied&Emathla. Lizzie made no reply, for she feared to add to the shadow which already clouded his brw Days passed on, and yet, to each request of. the girls for permission to depart, the chief made some excuse. At one time they bad not gained strength to travel; atanother,there were signs of an approaching storm. Yet, though very attentive, his actions were respectful, He, would make his warriors exercise in all their wild, martial evolutions before them, cause themto leap, wrestle, and dancevarious dances, to east the spear, and shoot with their bows and arrows, to:ride their untamed ponies, te., Again he would take them out over his fertile  fields, gathering for them fruits and flower i as they went  But his brow darkened wljen  ever they spoke of leaving.  Of Lizzie he a seemed to be particularly fond. For hours hI e would stand and watph her every look and :. action, as she conversed with Bnth, seeming utterly absorbed in thought and silent admira- h tion of her beauty.  t-  The poor girls, in whose hearts hope had ,f once more lighted a flame, began again to de- e spond, although Ruth would not utterly de- re spair, while she sa* that their boat, in every. re thing untouched, still lay at her moorings so Ih near them. But their anxiety began to weat re, upon them, especially on Lizzie. Their app6. Id tites failed; though the most delicious fodd from river and from forest was laid before them, and lusoious fruits heaped up aromid W   them  Ematia seemed to observe this with onoern, yet he did not consent to their de. p!rture. They felt they were indeed neither more or less than prisoners, and as birds in a age, even though it be gilded and they fed with hands unsparing, they pined away. One day, after they had been several wetes within Emathla's lodge, while he was absent on a hunt, they strolled forth, as they were ofen wont to do, arm in arm, to commune with each other, and grieve over each other's sor- rows. They had passed without the hounds of the village, and had entered a small magnolia grove, when they discovered a small lodge al. most hidden in a bower of wild honeysuckles. And from this they heard faint wailing and sobs With that natural sympathy, which seems even to dwell within the heart of wo- men, and to open her ear to every sound of dis- tress, they hastened to the lodge. What was their surprise, there to discover, bound hand and foot, so that she could not leave the couch upon which she reolined, Luli. ona, the chieftain's lovely daughter. A look- frst of pleasure, then one of terror-flitted over her face, as she said, in Spanish: "Go henee-go hence, for if my father sees you here, he will slay me, and be angry with you." Why does Luliona weep, and why does her father keep her here?" asked Lizzie, not heeding her warni ng. " My father has bound me, for I threatened to tell the pale fa&ed maidens that he would ever let them go, but make them his wives,  u he has sworn to do. He is terrible in his anger-he struck my mother because she wish-  ed to go back to the pale-faces-and she died!"  ,  Ltze turned pale as the magnolia filwers  above her head, when she heard those words,  ad translated them to Ruth.  "  We must escape upon the first opportu- nity that offers," said Ruth, startled at the - mew danger thus revealed. "Ask the poor I   if she will go with us, if we take measures  to fly from hr father' power."      b idie propounded the question.     t "Ye, Luliona will go, for EmathU would  sy her in his rage, when he found that the b plan-faed maidens had fled away," was the c "Then bid her keep her ea  opea, and q Xw I the atorm-spirit omne again to sakr  "PM e   h the forest-trees, and bring darkness on the e- earth-when the winds howl, and the raine er beat, for then will we escape this new peril, or a perish in the attempt!"I d  Lizzie faithfully translated the language of Ruth. Luliona listened and replied: "s *The words of the pale-faced maiden are t words of wisdom. The wind will speak sB e loud that no other sounds will reach the h watchers' ears-the rain will wash away the trail of those who speed away, and it willnot be seen. Luliona will not sleep when the a storm comes, but she will watch for her pale faced sisters, and be ready to guide them through the forests, toward the settlements of d the north. But now, go hence, for-if Emathla comes he will be angry, and all is lost!" The girls felt the truth of this, and hastened * away, and returned to their lodge long befor the chief returned from the hunt. CHAPTER XXIV. Ruth and Lizzie now agreed to appear more contented with their lot, and to ask no more for permission to depart, so as to lull, if possi- ble, all suspicions which Emathla mightenter. tain of their real intentions. Once more they ate heartily, and the color returned to their cheeks, and elasticity to their forms. The'pleased chieftain redoubled his efforts t" gratify them. He hunted more than ever, and brought them the flesh of the young does --that of bears, and of young cattle, and wild turkeys, pigeons, doves, plover, flamingoes, ducks, and fruits of every kind. Also fish and turtle, and oysters, from the rivers and bay. No luxury that his wide range afforded, or his skill could compass, was forgotten. His wo- men made them magnificent mantles of many. hued feathers; they worked soft and beautiful moccasins for their feet, and each day strewed carpets of fresh flowers for them to tread upon. Right princely in his way, did Emathl!oon- duct himself, but, like all human beings, he had an end to gain-interest was the founda- tion of his every act. He had their forms 'within his power, but be wished to win their, hearts, and used such means as he thought best calculated to attain his object. During all this time, Lizzie and Ruth were quietly and secretly prepair'ng for their in- ended escape. They had preserved th   arms and ammunition about their persons ever h ince they landed, and now, in the night time,  having opened an aperture, by which one of them could creep out through the outer wall, . of thelodge, at night, and visitthe boat, they  managed to get together a small stock of pro- visions to strengthen themselves with in their o flight, without creating any suspicion, for the b aperture was closed upon. the re-entrance of t the one who went out. And they began seriously to look, and  I anxiously to pray for a stormy night to come, for Emathla, apparently encouraged by their seeming contentedness with their lot, began r quite plainly to give hints of his desires and V intentions. While he treated them so kindly, a he treated his other women more like slaves - than wives, and at times, with a cruelty that  did not make them wonder at the tale which - they had heard from Luliona's lips.  At last their prayers were heard; In the day-time a terrific storm burst upon the land. The great trees bent and groaned before the terrible blast, and their gnarled branches - twisted and writhed like the arms of ponder- ous beings endowed with life, yet suffering in agony. The solid ground seemed to shake W ith the concussive thunderings from above, while the ragged and rent clouds sent forth hissing lightnings on the air. And, as night drew on, heav rain came down- in blinding sheets, though the wiad leased not, and tihe tempest-raged on. The two girls, appearing to be terror-struck, although their hearts were glad within them, would not go out to lookupon the torm. Emathla smiled upon their terror, and strove to cheer them, but Lizzie prayed him to go away, and let them sleep, that they might not hear the wild turmoil made by the war of elements. He did so, and then, when the late- ness of the hour caused them to believe that he had gone to rest, they prepared to leave. First wrapping their lamunition In many folds of cloth, so as to preserve4 it from the wet, and securing their arms to the same purpose, they gathered their provisions, and then all was read, "Stay here, Lizzie, until I go and cast loose our boat. The tide is at an ebb, and the strong wind blowing from the land, will dirve it far ot to sea, and the chief wili think that we   have escaped in it, and not be so apt to ollow us, or seek for us on the land." "So do, dear Ruth; yet remember how watchful he is-the least noise may awaken him.'"  "Fear not, Lizzie--nought can be heard from outside in such a storm as this," replied the brave girl, as she passed through the aperture to fulfill her intention. : Soon she returned, and said-"It is done, -Lizzie; now, let us hasten to the lodge of poor Luliona"' Though it was very dark, and the pattering rain fell thick and fast, they knew their way well, for they had trodden it more than once, and had carried to the lodge of the Indian girl, by her desire, a bow and quiver of arrows, and materials for making moccasins on their road; fot, said the girl, in her figurative way, "Many suns will rise and set, before the pale-faced maidens see their people-and rough paths must be trodden, high hills climbed, and broad streams passed. And in the day serpents may sting us, and in the night, the tiger and the wolf, and the wild-cat and the bear, may come upon us as we camp." On arriving at the lodge, in which the In- dian girl was confined, they found her awake, and, lightin- her lantern, which she had not forgotten, Ruth hastened to out her bonds; In a brief time they were ready and equipped for their journey, as well as they could be, un- der the circumstances. Pointing toward the 'north, Luliona bade them ecoh to take her by the hand, so that they should not be separated in the darkness and storm, and to hasten as fast as they could, for they must go far before the day broke. Then, each of them carrying a proportion of their provisions, with blankets f over all, and' Luliona, having her bow and arrows slung at her back, they went forth in the darkness. Suddenly, even above the wild howlings of f the storm, a terrible yell was heard, and itwas I re-echoed by an hundred cries from other quar- ters. And blazing torches could be seen in the distance, passing to and fro swiftly. "Tatwires my father's whoop-your fligh ae as been discovered. Our steps must be swift g and light as that of the frightened fawhn when r it flies'hefore the hound, or we are lost " said e the Indian gir l.    Lizie told her what Ruth had donewith the boat which, in all likelihood, was even then ecudding out to sea before the gale. "My pale-faced sister is wise-Emathla will not find our trail, for the rain falls fast, and will wash it away," said the Indian girl, as she hurriedly led her companions off through the broad savannas and the tangled forests, which stretched away to the north, swerving not in her course, nor pansing for'an instant in the rapid march. Soon the sound of the wild yells ceased to refah their ears, and the light of the flashing torches faded in the distance. q    ..  COHAPTER XXV. Wild was the excitement and  fearful the rge of Emathla when he found that the pale- feed girls had fled. Restless alike from his passions, which like olcanic fire raged al the more intensely, that they were pent up and restrained, and from the turmoil of the storm, he rose from his couch, and went to see if yet they slept or were kept awake by the terrc of the tempest. The wild, shrill, far-echoing yell which they had heard, burst from his hps, when he discovered their empty couch and the unclosed aperture in the side of the lodge. Rushing out amidst his terrified wo- men, he thrust a  resinous torch of pine splin. 1 tern into the smouldering fire which burned in ] the outer, or cooking, room of the lodge. It 1 was in a blaze in an instant, and he rushed out into the storm.  The first discovery which he a made, was. that the boat was gone from its t moorings. . Yell upon yell broke from hislips, I and soon answering cries from his warriors a told that they had been aroused from slumber. t And torches quickly flubed from  lodge to a lodge throughout the village, and a gathering b of armed men were by his side.       b His orders were quickly given. Some of n his men, with himself at their head, sprang into n owloe  and rapidly paddled down  the river, while others, torches in hand, sped swiftly w along the banks.              d It was not long before the eanoee reached M the mouth of the river, yet they sw no sign of the fugitives or the boat. It, with an ebbing b tide and a  furious gale from 'the west, had a been swept out over the bar on which the g8 bn  weri w    madly leaping in their foisnlg th   be glee, or, perchance striking there, had been n riven in a thousand fragments. Emathla landed here, for he dared not tempt "the surf which raged in fury on the bar, and id causing large fires to be built. he awaited the w dawn of day, amid the pitiless peltings of the h storm, chafing the while as he strode towand I, fro, like an angered lion in his den. g  Day broke at last, and though the chieftain t scanned the sea, even to the far horizon, with eager eyes, and caused his warriors to climb. o to the top of the tallest trees to look, nor far g nor near could be seen sign oi token of the boat or those whom he sought. Moodily he returned with his warriors to his village, and when his women brought him a food he would not taste it. At last he be-  thought him of his daughter, and at near the s mid-day hour he went to see her. Twere hard to picture his anger; mingled I with distress, whenrhe found that she too had fled. Bitter words broke from  his lips, and he vowed that he would not rest until he had found and punished those who had dared to fly from his power and thwart his will. "They have fled to the north along   the coast," he' muttered.  "They will seek for pale-faced friends in the Georgia settlements, for Luliona is their guide, and she has been there. Emathla will follow them, even as the hound upon the track of game, and he will 'know no rest until his hand is on themr*" The chief went to his lodge, and dressed his scalp-look and bound it round with a blood-red thong. He   darkened one-half of his face- blackened it to the shade of the midnight clouds. And he painted the other as red as the glare of his own camp fire, aye, redder still, like the blood which he had shed in battle. And he gathered his choicest arms, and bade his women parch corn for him, for a long march was, before him, on which he would neither hunt, nor pause to cook food. When he was prepared, again his shrill yell was heard throughout the village, and quickly did his warrior gather again in answer to the well known signal. - When the. warriors saw that- Emathis had bound the crimson thong around his saclp-1iek, a sign as well as his painted face that he was going on the war-path, their glad shouts rent the still air, for the storm had died away, nad   the sun looked out upon bending bush and stricken flower once more. Rmwth^pieked a chosen band of about-one hundred young, athletic men, those who had proved themselves hardy and bravebeneath his own. eye, and who wore many a record of strife in the soars upon their forms. These he ordered to prepare, as he had done, for a long and rapid march, in which no pause for hunt- ing or cooking would be allowed  But he did not tell them whither= hewas bound-it was enough that Ae led-they would not fail to fol- iow- Within an hour from the time when he had summoned them. all were ready for the ware path, and givingone shrill parting yell, which wa re-echoed by those who were left'behind, the band in single file followed their leader, who, with rapid steps, took a course to the northward. Nor did he pause, or cast a' single !Iok behind, until, as the sun's last ray kissed its farewell to -earh, he halted on a broad river's bank, and bade his warriors eneamp until the light of day enabled them to arrange meaures for rossing it. Not Iong^vould they have been ecrossing, had not danger lurked within the waters-for every Indian swims-but it was near the sea, and hungered sharks and alligators are not foes to be despised. Though his warriors slept, Emathla did not close his eyes ; out, sleepless, stoodsentinelover al Little did he dream whose eyes -were fixed upon his form as he strode to and fro, mutter- ing aloud his angry thoughts, as he paced be- fore his amp-fire.  CHAPTER XXV!. After the fugitive girls left the camp, they aped on as rapidly as possible through the re- mainder of the night-over plains, through. forests, swamps and all that intervened in their course.  The hooting of the owl the howling of the wolves, and now and then the shrill cry of sole- startled night bird would make ;izzie, and Ruth start in affright, but Lulionayoung as she was, seemed almost insensible to fear,d and she sheered them as she hurried their steps. When the storm  ceased, they fopnd 'them- elves on. the shore of a wide river, and upon looking to the eastward they c0ould isee the blueuexpa  of the ocean, strethigfar away    to the horizon, but not a speok upon its bosom, except the caps of foam which orested the azure waves.  Faint and weary from mheir long and rapid march, the girls hastened to the river to quench their thirst, but the water was salt and bitter to the taste, and they could not swal- low it. . Ruth produced a bottle of wine, and herself and Lizzie took a small quantity of that, but Luliona would not touch it, for she believed it to be, "fire water" which she had seet in theIndian camp, and had witnessed the evil effects thereof. -But she- hastened to some low-limbei trees which were growing near, and detached a broad leaved plant which looked something like the juice apple-top, and which though not a part of the tree, seemed to grow and flourish whereverithad been stuck.* Ithad many leaves, all spreading out like a vase at the top, and was filled with sweet and excel. lent water. This she brought to the maidens, to their utter astonishment, for, had they been alne, they would have perished of thirst be- fore theywould have thought of lookingin the tree-tops for water. "How   wonderful are the ways of Pronv- denee l' said Ruth, as she drank of the cool. and refreshing water. ' "The Great Spirit is good!" said Lulion, when Lizzie, told her whhat Ruth had said. Buth   now  proposed that they  should' strengthen themselves with food, which they did, and then she asked how they could cross that deep and broad river. "When the night comes again, I will make a raft and areas it,"' said the Indian girl. , But  we must hide during the day,- lest some of the hunters of, my father's band should come across  us, for we are not yet a hilf day's march from - his village."  ' Though anxious to hasten toward the settle- ments, our heroines at once saw the necessity of this arrangement, and told Luliona to choose a fitting hiding-place where they might rest during the day.          / The Indian girl soon round one. .A   huge oak, which. had been up-rooted in some geat storm, lay near the river's bank, and its imr -iThd  iscahied by omne the " wild ptne" bs othnnt thi "air plant" ' d as ib opent cp collece and!hold -all tlh  dew and rain which fxlr, it geoeratlyt ifrund ontkiniW D  fromaptnthto aquitofpurew et Water, t i -ith-rl Wfiti-i. .     '   nmede tnmk was hollow. Into this Lnuliona carned some grass, and fragrant flowers, and herbs which she gathered, and spreading out such of their. garments as were dry, she mase a couch for them and then hung the wet gar- ments in the sun in a small open spot surround ' ed by a thicket to dry.' While thus engaged, a piercing scream rose from the lips of Lizzie, and, as she flew to her aid. she saw a huge rattlesnake which had sprung from his coil, and struck the hapless girl, oiling again for another attack. She wiseed a stick and dispatched the venemous reptoe, M Lizzid sunk fainting to the ground, moaning: * Death-death at last and such a death!" "My sister will not die l" said the brave Indian girl, as she rushed into the densest part of the forest In a few moments she returned, bringing several plants with a large bulbous root, having only three serrated and pointed leaves of a dark green. These roots she hastily washed, and giving a couple to Lizzie, bade her chew them and swallow the juide.' Then ahewing one herself, she uncovered Lizzie's wounded limb-which was deeply discolored and already beginning to swell rapidly-and, in spite of Lizzie's efforts to prevent her, she ap- plied her lips to the wound, and commenced sucking out the blood and poison, rinsing her mouth with water once in a while, and chewing the root which she had brought Within an half-hour all sign of inflammation and danger had passed away, and Lizzie was safe while Lnliona felt no inconvenience from her singular mode of surgery.* "Angel you have saved my life t" said la sie as she showered tears and kisses upon the Indian maiden, when she felt that indeed all danger was over. "It was the will of the Great Spirit!" said Lawons. "'There is no evil for which Ha hath not prepared a remedy!" , Trie-moat true " responded the grate. ful girl. ' But had you been absent I should have perished, for I knew no oure!" lMy sidters must sleep now, for when the *prbap Up rftder hs heBrd tu antent la which td f maidenwo pooht thu to ts hepoSon from t 1or, lbuo tl db- tn lten bya psmn pplent " fhl d; hf toortan itkilled her. tR wmeUnftome br oe m dar. Mand will mverbrrota dho"ti lon' ftto Lhaar tLt   night comes, we must haaen on ourjoudrney '" said the Indian girl gently, and she gathered in the clothes which were already dried by the hot sun, and led them to theo coueh which she had prepared. Then, clasped in each others, arms those three pure-hearted angels of humanity went calmly to sleep, and they did not wake, until the sun was casting its last rosy rays upon the waters. They'were about to prepare to re- sume their journey, as soon as twilight dew its gray veil over the face of nature, When Lulie- ona's quick ear caught the sound of the tread of many feet.   . "Hist, breathe not aloud " she murmured. - "I hear the tread of warriors t" They drew back into the dark hollow of the log, and with fear and trembling, waited for the result. Great was their terror, when they saw that it was Emathla and his band, and it did not decrease when they saw that he would not pass the river that night, but would encamp there. So close was he to them that each word he spoke fell distinctly on their ears, and the Indians actually broke off'dead limbs from the tree in which they were concealed to build their campfire with. But they were not discouraged, though they dared not close their eyes or scarcely breathe aloud. From the fiercely muttered threats of her father, as he strode to and fro by the camp-fir*, Luliona learned what would be her fate. if he should find her, and if there was a lingering spark of love left in her breast for him, his words would have extinguished it forever. Antl from his mutterings she learned another thing, which was of great importance, and which de. termined her futare course. In his ravings he spoke of the Georgia settlements to which hi believed his daughter bad piloted the fugitixve in their boat. Terribly long seemed that night, but at last the day dawned, and eunstrneting raftt from driftwood, Emathla and his party a,on crossed the river, and sped away on their march. Then-for she had not dared even to whisper before--Luiona told her companions of the words from her fbthers lips, which had fallen * on her ear during the night, and laid her plans for the ft   before them. She promised t- J.   follow the course of the river, in the thickets along its banks until near night, and then to cross -it, and pursue a northern course upon the upland' back from the course which Emathla had taken. Thus she hoped to avoid all danger from any stragglers from his band; for often, if a warrior sickened on the march, he was left to return to the village, or recruit and join them when he could. As soon as they had refreshed themselves 'with food and with water from the " air plants," they again resumed their march. But their progress was not very, rapid, for Ruth and Lizzie were unused to walking far, and their course lay through a rough and tangled range of thickets. Frequently they were obliged to make wide circuits around patches of the prickly pear, or thorny cactus.' 'When the sun was about two hours high, they came to a spring of cool water, from -which they startled a flock of wild turkeys.' In an instant, an arrow -ped from Luliona's bow, and one of the fattest of them lay dead before them. "-We shall not starve t" said Ruth as she noted the skill of the young huntress. "How good God has been to give us such an aid ani. hueah, gnidel' -            8 Luliona quickly dressed the. turkey, tearing off the skin, as the Indians generally do, in. stead of picking the feathers.' She then dis. membered and washed it, and upon forked sticks pi sceeded to cook their evening meal before a small fire which- she had. kindled. They were much refreshed by the food and the delicious water, and'it was determined to cross the river there, and to travel all the night. The sun was just going down when the In- dia* girl finished her raft, of driftwooA, bound together by grape-vines, and embarking the girs upon it, she soon with a long pole pushed it ross to the opposite shore. Guided by the - stare. which shone brightly above them, and their pathway through the dense wilderness, lightened here and there by the-moon, which calmly sailed through the terial space over- head, they moved on more rapidly than they had- done on the first night. Only three or four times did they pause to rest, for Ruth and Lizzie, though suffering intensely from faigutieeerted every nerve to- keep on with their more hardy and experienced guide.'   When the day dawned. a place was found in a dense thicket, Where the " air plants" ag"in furnished them with water, and- having pa taken of food, they Soughtrest fortheir wearied limbs upon a bed of flowers and leaves which the Indiangirl quickly prepared. Here, shaded ' -by the thilk branches overhead, they slept untilnearly night, when they awoke, refreshed, and ready again to start upon their toilsome way. And now the provident care of Lullona I aved them from much suffering. lThe brain- bles, and thorns, and rocks, had so out up, thei thin moocasins that their bare and tender feei Would soon have been exposed, had she not ha more tanned buckskin, along with whichi a a brief time,-she made thicker and strongeJ ones than those they Cast off, Which added, much to their comfort. A perfect child of the forest, she seemed if  everything to be at home there, even as mueb as the others would have been in a furnished house-utterly fearless, with an expedient eve! ready in her mind to meet any emergency; ot fill every requirement; To them, she was in- deed like a guardian angel, But we must leave our wanderers- for a time, hoping that they will ,' get out of 'the woods" sometime, ' and look elsewhere for a season. CHAPTER XIVIi. After his suceessee in the/north, Washing-- ton's attention was earnestly turned to th*e situation of the Carolinas and Georgia;, where the British had not only aetes! with atrocious eruelty, but a partisan warfare of unparalleed, bitterness was- being carried on between the native citizens, whigs and tories. Quarter was in alpost every case refused. Often, in op- posing ranks, brother met brother and tlthi met son. Tertible indeed was the struggle. patriotism and poverty opposed to British steel, and the British gold which could buj traitors to freedom's holy cause. 'Greene, the-gallant Nathaniel, who never went home to his Quaker mother with a *wond- in his back, commanded in the Catolinas where he was aided by Marion, Horry, telk. ens, Lee and: Sumner, and General WaytS,  glorious old "Mad Anthony'! of Stoty Point renown, was sent to Georgia.

Free to go when and where he pleaed, well mounted and armed, his recon- oisanees were very daring, frequently ex- tending into the very camps of the enemy, and any information whieh he brought could be implieitly relied on. It wa the night of June third, 1782, Gen- eral Wayne, who was closely watehing the eaxy in Savannah, entting off their foraging puties, et., Was encamped on Gibbon's plan. tation new that eity in a position to guard with his pickets the various approaches to his town. As he always did, preferring to sharethe hard- ship of his soldiers, rather than to consult his own comfort, he was in his tent, though not at distant a furnished mansion stood, which at his  service. He was on this balmy June evening en- deavoring, with Lieutenant Colonel Posey, of Virginia, and the gallant Captain Parker, of the am astate, and a subordinate officer, engaged in killing--not fleas or musquitoes, though both were plenty-but Tnub. which ever lays heavy on a true soldier's hands, when he is not oeupied.

But the Colonel did not deal that hand, for i the elatering of horne's feet at full speed fell Upn their ears, and a horseman reined up at 1 the front of the tent, and  springing to the  ground hstily entered It w   Saul 8abberday, and his appearance betokeaed that he had ridden ad and fat   1   "Gin'ral" said he, ' I know you'd rather fight than eat, so pitch away them " kerd&' for I reckon you'll have a nice kind of a lskrim- mage afore you're an hour older." * "What is up-are the British coming out of Savannahs ' asked the old soldier springing to his feet, and grasping the heavy sabre, which hung upon the tent pole, and buckling it to his side. "No, Gin'ral. but there's a thunderin' big squad o'them Ingens that the British and tories have been braggin about, comin' just a, straight for our camp as if they'd traveled the road afore. I was a scoutin' up toward the Altamaha, when I saw the red painted heathen a comin'. So I turned off into a thicket, and watehed 'em till I counted a hundred or more, and then seein' they were a comin' this way, I started full split by a roundabout way, so that they shouldn't see me, and hereI am, I guess, an hour or so ahead of em!" "Were they well armed?" asked the gallant Posey. "They had lots of spears, and bows, and arrows, and. some guns 1" replied Saul, " but you'd better be movin' your troops, or they'l be screeehin' and yellin' amongst yout, afore you know it. Blast 'em, let 'em holler, they shall hear my Trumpet o' Zion, and they can't scare Nathan Hale's horse 1" , * Nor his rider either-take a pull out of the black pitsher, Saul, my brave lad 1" said the General. "No thankee, Gin'ral--the stuff that makes drunk come, don't agree with me!" said Saul, who was busy repriming hi' pistols. * Colonel, have the men under arms at once, we will post them under cover, and take the red rascals unawares. Remember, gentleme, that the bayonet is my favorite weapon-it won Stony Point, and I know by experience in other days, that Indians can't stand it One volley, and then let cold ste I do the rest. Or, derly, bring me my horse instantly. Form your men, gentlemen, I will be in the the saddle in five minutes 1" "And I, in five seoonds, to see how they progress, the sneakin' red thievery" said Saul, as he again mounted his horse and rode away. "Be cautious--don't expose yourself cried Wayne.   But Saul was far away ere the words had left the General's lips, The troops were soon under arms, and rang- ed along in the dense thickets which skirted the road and hedged the fields. Wayne and his scanty staff was mounted and drawn up in the dark shadow of a clump of trees near the head of his line, ready and impatient for the action to commence, for though a veteran in years and service, he was a boy in enthusiasm and restlessness--jfist the character for the kind of desultory border warfare in which he was engaged. For full an hour they stood and sat in per- fect siltnae. And how dread, how heavy hang that silent space of time be ore a battle, when almost breathlessly you wait for an advancing' foe. It is more trying to a brave man' nerves tlian-the perils which he meets in the blood- iest strife that ensues. Suddenly, the sound of distant yells, and mcattering shots was heard-nearer and nearer they o ime. then clattering hoofs rung on the air. and Saul dashed down the road to the spot where Wayne had stationed himself, and cried: ** The darned red-skins are a eomin',-Gin'ral, -Xthey were a-sneakin' along so cautious, that I was right among 'em e'en afore I knowed it. Jerusalem, how they yelled I They shot some, but the bullet isn't run, that's to take me to kingdom come, yit, I guess 1" ** leady-puss the word along the lines!" said Wayne, in a low, steady voice, as the In-. diansa yells came nearer and nearer. Soon the head of their line, a disorderly but heavy maos, could be seen rushing down the road which Saul had taken. The moon shone bright and clear, and the troops, from their thadowy covers, had every advantage on their side. On came the red men-a gigantic warrior at their head, whose loud yell' was heard far above the rest, as he brandished a gun in one hand,- and a glittering tomahawk in the other. Wayne waited until the mass was fairly abreast of his men, and then gave the word to Are. Deadly indeed was the volley which was poured in upon tie astonished foe. Many of them fell, but their giant chief seemed to re- main unharmed amid the terrible shower of   death, for his cry still rose loud and cleat above all other sounds.     . "Charge!" shouted Wayne, as he drove his spurs into his horse, and dashed forward with his heavy sabre. "Charge y" yelled Saul Sabberday, and wi h an ear-piercing blast from his- craeved bugle he dashed out in the tracks of his gallant. chief. And- it was well that he did, for the next second Wayne was rolling in the dut beneath his horse, which was shot dead under him. and a dozen savaged sprung forward to dispatch him. But Saul, with his fiery horse, and his glittering sabre,- was among them, and death followed every blow be struck. Poat,y, too, was there, and in a moment more W as te, un- hurt, had risen to his feet, and his eiittorion voice rung through the air a- he shouted: "Charge home, boys-charge home 1-the battle is won P!" The Indlan chief, bleeding from many a wound, heard his battle-cry, and, ainglilg him. as the leader, darted toward him, casting his glittering tomahawk as he came. It gouzed the General's cheek, aud the next instaut,as the giant chief strove to grapple with him, his sword passed to- the vergy tiltr. I h9 thodg.

And, riding madly in the very frout, was Saul Sabberday, blowing fearful blusts upon his bugle, and cutting down each frightened wrewh whom he overtook. In reading history, this attack on Wayne i4 attributed to the Creeke. yet some hibtorrianf are apt to err, aud in this Mase they did-id est, if you'll believe me I! Oa rode Saul-on, until at last there seemed to be no red ma left to slay. He had gotwt   fir in advance of the rest, and had reined in his horse to return. He thought, however, dAt he would give one more fearful blast on Zon's trumpet to sare the life out of any re. maining fugitive, should there be'one. ' Hill and valley, plain and mountain, rang with the peal, and gave wild echoes back. He was about to turn back, when a faint vo[ie from a thicket close by, said: Saul--Saul, is that thee!" "What the deuce was that  aid Saul, tLo seared than he had been in any action yet; " darned if I didn't hear a woman's voiee, di it sourted like sister Ruth. Golly, if it Aould be her ghost P" 4 Saul--Saul, it. is thy sister Ruth, and no S%4*t 1" cried the poor girl, as she recognized bwr brother, and sprung from the thicket, fol- lowed by Lizzie and Luliona But the joy of the poor girl was too great for her exhausted state--he fell ere she had pssed half the space between them, and dinted. Saul sprung from his horse, and hastened to bar aid, and Lizzie and the Indian girl hurried to her aide, and railed her drooping head. t Baul's canteen of water was applied to her Iipr, and soon a faint sigh auuounced that she was coming back into a state of consciouaness. Saul now recognized Lizzie, but he looked with a suspicious eye on Luliona, evidently eenneeting her in his mind with those whom Uh hid so lately met in eonflit. "Who is that ere Ingen gal?" he asked. She has been our guide and saviour," sid Ltzzle. *"Had it not been for her, we should bave perished long sinme, or met a fate more terrible than death!"

He then bade them a good night, and they, not forgetting to return thanks to the Great Spirit for his protective providence, retired to a needed rest at last, without the fear whiah had so long troubled them. CHAPTER XXVH It was a couple of days before the-peor, worn-out girls felt able to see General Wayne but in the meantime, they were kindly nursed by some sympathetic patriot ladies, who had. been informed of their amval, and furnished them with suitable clothing, in place of their torn and soiled garments. The European style of dress appeared very awkward to Luliona, whose peerless limbs, and perfect form had only known the loose legging of fringed fawn skin, the short petticoat of gay feathers, and a mantle of the same, while her tiny feet were ased in mocessins which yielded to every motion; but yet she looked, even in that dress very beautiful, the more so, that her jetty hair, great black eyes, all full of life and love, and warmth, and her dark complexion, of al- most a refined olive hue, contrasted with the loveliness, so different, of her two companions. When Saul visited his 'sister on the third morning after her arrival, and saw Lulionasn this dress, he could scarcely keep his eyes bff from her. When he heard Lizzie talking to her in the dulcet language of Castile, he asked if she could not understand English. He was told that she could not Jeusatem I how can I tU herP' he mut- tered, with a woe-begone look. -"What does thee want to tell her, Saul ' atked his sister, kindly.

"I wish thee to say to thy general that we are now so rested that we would be glad to confer with him regarding our trying to reach our friends in the north. Our mother, and the poor. widow Hale, are doubtless in great dis- tress, and when our brothers return to themn- from a vain search after use, their distress will be heavier sti}l! ' "I'lltell him. and he'll be here in less time than an Irishman would take to peel a tater!" said Saul, hurrying out. i Saul had previously to this told her of the visit of his mother to the camp of the viotori- out Washington, and of the expedition of Seth md Simeon, bound for Bermuda It was not long before the brave old general made his appearance before our triad of hero-- ines, who received him with the respect and gratitude so much his due. '"And so you wavnt to leave old Mad An thonyS ocamip, do you; young ladies? Rather tough for such tenider ones, eh?" said he, in a Jovial tone, as he seated his portly person in an old-fashioned chair. "Not so rough as we have endured of-late!" replied Ruth, "but we know that anxious friends and relatives are waiting to hear from us-perchance believing that -we are lost?' *True-true my child.

"   "Will the Ingen girl go with you!' asked Wayne. "Oh, to be sure she will. Never-ncoer. will Lizzie or I desert her, who has saved usl" said Ruth earnestly. "* Our home shall be her home, and our bread her bread, so long as we live!" Sauls at this moment returned, and seeing the General, stood at "Attention," and gave him the military salute. "Saul, my boy, go to my tent, and if Cap- tain Giles, the Yankee skipper, has got tlhrouh his eorn-doger and baton breakfast, bring him here 1"' Saul again saluted, turned on his heel with soldierly preeision, for he saw that Lulions was looking at him, and disappeared.* Soon tihe Yankee Sipper made his appear ance. And such an appearance I A smilr gathered on Ruth's grave face, and a curious look gathered on Luliona's countenance, for his rig and general phisiquewere different from anything which she had yet seen among-whits folks. He had evidently "dressed to see company," before he came ashore. On the top of a very large head he wore a bell-crowned hat, with a very, narrow rim. Beneath that, plastered down upon cheeks of parchment hue and tex. ture, was-- mass of long yellowish heir. His eyes were small, and between a green and a gray in color. His neck was long and thin, but a very stiff, and a very high shirt colla, reaching up under his ears, braced it up and kept it perpendicular. His snuff colored coat was'exceedingly short-waisted, the- waist-but rtons being high up on his back, but that brevity was more than atoned for; by the length of itm. swallow ails, which came to two sharp points, pretty well down toward the calf of his leg, if calf there was there. His pantaloons, or trowosers, as my friend Medad called them, were ample about the waist and hips, but grew rap  idly less toward the knees, below which they scorned to descend more than three or four inches. His feet which were apparently built on the scow model, so as not to sink in muddy going, were encased in a pair of cowhide boots whih, with a fresh " lick of grease on them, ; looked to be at least, water proof, if not bul let proof. *Captain Giles, ladies, of the schooner . rush!" said the general.   "How dy'e do, gala i" said the captain; giv- ing a short forward jerk of his head, and a backward sorape of his right foot, and taking off his hat. which he commenced smoothing over with a gay colored cotton handkerchief. - "These ladies are very anxious to get to the north," continued the general. You will olige Ame much if you can take them, and besides they will pay you well for their passage. I shall send the brother of Mis Ruth a an es- eort with t bhem, and he will ave you all trouble, and see to their wantsl" The captain seemed to consider a moment and then aid: "I'd like to obtkege YOU, Gin'rsl, though your oook don't know no more how to make Johny *ake out o' corn-meal thban a hoess does--and then the pewtcr ) on ay the'll pay, is a cosoaid. mtion, but Ilm aind-.rafeared to take'em.

"Let such old-womanish ideas go the devil V' aid Wayne, impatiently. "Name the price of your pausage, and say when you'll sail.

CHAPTER XXIX. The Jerusba was of a build now as seldom to he seen in our waters, almost' as a Dutch galliot or a Chinese junk. High sterned, with a cabin that was half below and half above the level of the deck forward, her bluff bows seeming about to butt right down. into the water before her, with very large and stumpy lowermasts, long-legged topmasts and sails blackened with smoke and mildew, and rig- ging that looked as if it never had been tarred -anchors and chains, eye-bolts and taokle- hooks all covered with rust-unpainted mast- heads and bulwarks, and hull which might have been painted when she was launched, thoughl it was- a doubtful matter-she did not give Skipper Giles very great credit either 68 a seaman or a person fond of the ornamental Yet she bad a stout and stubbed look-ap- peared as if ehe could butt her way into er bead sea, and knock it smooth, if no'more, tthough any idea of getting speed out of her, would be as preposterous as expecting rapid legislation from members paid by the day, or justice from a New York judge and jury. . Washbing of decks, scraping and slushing of masts, and blacking of rigging, seemed to be antagonistic to the religious scruples of the crew, whichs last consisted of one mate, one oook, one boy of all work, and two men, who, being all related to Captain Giles, and messing with him in the cabin, did just about as they pleased, obeying such orders as they liked and no others. The gaDey, or caboose, in which the cooking is usually done on board merchant vessels, was on the low deck, and liable to be washed away by every sea, .were it not very securely lashed to ring-bolts on every side. When the weather was too heavy to cook there, a cook-lstove in the front cabin was brought into use. The after-cabin was a little bit of a den with only two wide berths, one on each side, and a sofa couch laying athwartships on the transom. The furniture w"a about as gaudy as the old schooner herself, and consisted only of a greasy table and a few stools. Her crockery -IrtC , again-was mostly of tin and pewter,   and neither knifn, plate or cup, gave signs of wearing out with over scouring. Nor did the sheets or blankets, or ancient and tattered quilts in the berths, appear to have ever known soap and water, or suffered at the hands of the washerwoman. To this vessel, on Saturday afternoon, Geu- eral Wayne escorted the three females, and and placed them, with Saul, in charge of Cap- tain Giles, who, in his tarpaulin sou'-wester, pea-jacket, etc., did not look qfuite so ridicu- lous as he did in his visiting toggery, Saul was almost ineonsolable at the thought of leaving Nathan Bale's horse behind, but the General had promised to keep the horse with his own, and to permit no one but him- self to ride it, and to take it north for Saul when he went, and with this, Saul was obliged to be satisfied, for his orders to go were per- emptory.        I       ' "Haven't you got a' hull Georgy arsenal with you?" asked Giles, as he looked in won- der at the armament with which Saul had pro- vided himself-a musket, with a bayonet fixed -a ashort blunderbuss, capable of carrying a poplnd or two of buck-shot or slugs-a pair of dragoon pistols of immense size, and the ele.- gant pair which Washington had given him. A huge sabre also rattled at his side, complet- iag his array of weapons. On his head he till wore his Continental hat with its *" wav- Jag plumes," looking, indeed, quite like a !oldier, for le, carried' himself up welland right jaunsly. Luliona, to whom he had paid every atten. tion that he could, and with whom he'bad' fallen desperately in love, seemed to be qute [truck with his appearance, as he strode on before them, and said to Lizzie: "The brother of our sister is a great war- riort , We need not be afraid while he lives to fight for us!" She, though she had  discarded her Indian dress, had insisted upon having her bow and arrows placed with the  baggage with which the ladies had  been provided, and the latter had preserved their dirks and pistols as relies f the past, more than anything else; for they {Mdid not dream that they would again have use for them. ;   ^"Lve got omethin' to wake. the Britishers tojudg ment" said Saul, as he showed Giles ^     .    his Trumpet of Zion, "and somethin' to bring 'em to a sense o' feelin' if they offer to trouble us on the voyage!" he added, pointing to hi weapons, in reply to the question of the skip. per.    '          ' "Be all -them ere tliings loaded?" asked Giles, drawing back as if he feared some of them might go- off on their own hook, *'I reckon they are!" said Saul, proudly. ** Then for marcy's sake do jest go anid fire em off afore you fetch 'en aboard the Jeru- shal" exclaimed the skipper, his ashen face turning blueish with alarm. "I know I'm a fool, but not quite such a fool as that, Mr. Skipperl" said Saul, firmly. "We've paid our passage, and we're goin' to carry our weepons, and be ready for squallse, if they come. If you say much, I'll go and git Nathan Hale's horse, and he shall have a cabin passage, tool"' "Let him have his own way. He. will stow his arnms away in the cabin, and there will be no harm donel' said Wayne. ,'Wall, then, let him  put 'em in the after cabin, for I've gin that up to the gala!" said Giles. Saul said no more, but went on board and stowed his arms where he could get at them - quickly, when he desired. ' "Have you any return cargo?" asked the General, for the hatches of the schooner were closed, and he could not see. "A ventur' of about a hundred bushel o' sweet 'taters, a few bags o' aller corn, four hogsheads of rum, two of 'lasses, and a nation fine lot o' peauuts-they bring a fust-rate pricee up   to Boston,!' replied the skipper, perfectly at home on that question. "Plenty of wood and water?', "Yes-wood didn t cost us nothin' you see, so we took in a good lot 1l" "You teeti so afraid of arms, that I s'po- you haven't any on board F - *Nothin' but an old musket without a lock, and the stock o' that is broke," said Giles. "Then Saul showed his sense in providian plenty! When do you saill" continued the General. ' Jest as soon as the ebb tide runs-in 'bout an hour, I  reckon-going to commence histin, sail purty soon, for it'll take the fellows 8!, that time to get it up ; for they're awful lazy    down here, wlere it's so hot; but they'll be o spryer whet we get to sea, in the fresh air. f Glad we hairit got no anchor to histe, for it s only to cast off from the steep bank, and we'll k bhate right out into the channel, as sliok as y grease I' The General now went ahoard with the la- dies, and bestowed them as comfortably as theirnarrow quarterewouldallow Fortunately, i the good ladies on shore, anticipating the di.-  aootforts of a Yankee coaster of that era, had t presented them with sheets, towels, soap, etc.,  * well a  fruits, preserves, crackers,'dries meats, and other luxuries.  But our heroines were not disposed to be e querulous aho-it their accommodations, for ,their thoughts only rested upon the prospect i of a speedy re-union with their friends and re- l4ives. After much tugging and hauling, and con- siderable grunting and groaning, the crew hoisted the sails, assisted in person by the skipper, .who, as he said, " wasn't afeard to dirty his hands a haulin'," and the General having gone ashore, and the tide turned, Cap- tain Gilea mounted the high quarter-deck, and took the helm, and gave orders to the cook to let go the last line which hound the vessel to the shore. Then, with creaking gaffs and booms, the Jerusha moved lazily from her berth, and while Saul blew a parting blast upon his bu- gle, and the ladies waved their handkerchiefs to the old General, she gathered as much head- way as she was capable of in smooth water, with a fresh breeze on her starboard quarter, and actually seemed to start out through the inlet at the rate of six or seven knots per hour The young ladies and their heroic friend, Lulions, who received from them constant wark of the most sisterly affection, remained on deck until the shades of night were draw- lg on, and the vessel having jibed, had haul- ed up on a north-easterly course along the About this time, the cook came aft, and a oloquy occurred between him and the cap- tain, which, as a chronicler of truth, I must record. "Cp'n," said the seok, whose greasy clothes aad look, smoke-dried and fireproof, bespoke hi profemion," 'spose we're to set e Ltables-    one for the passengers and t'other for us men futlks?"  ' Wall, yes, seein' as the table's small ad knives. and forks, and cups skeerce, reason you had; let them eat fust, and we'll eat arter- wards-" We Inint got no tea only bean coffee." "They hev. though. You jist ask that soger brothers o' theirs. and he'll git it. For my- part, I 'ike bean coffee the best. You jist ax the young man for any extras they want. I'm1 only bound to give 'em sich as we have." This matter was settled without the ladies hearing it. for, as the cook came aft, they enter- ed the cabin. Al hour after wards, a very tolerable slper, for it was eked out with their own stores, and superintended by Saul, was laid on the firs tw le. and discussed by the "passengers." After they were through, the captain gave up the helm to thfe cook, who had already tak- en care of number cne in the caboose, and went below, with the rest of the crew. to take his supper. Though he liked bean coffee the best, he very soon found that some of the tea which had been made for the ladies was left,amd while it lasted he did not trouble the bean coffee at all The reader will now, I hope, have gained a pretty full insight into the character of Cap- sin Giles and run of things aboard the Jem- sia, and leaving our friends with wishes for a good night's rest and a safe .voyage, we will take a cruise elsewhere. CHAPTER XXX. Closely did Seth Sabberday examine every nook, and hay, and inlet, along the aouat d the Bermudan Isles, in hopes of meeting some sign of the fugitive girls. ' But in vain; the look-outs from aloft and on deck gave out O cheering cry. After having done this, he sailed over to ward the Florida coast, and closely ran alon its shores. But this was while the girls were closely kept under Emathla's aye, and though the Thunderbolt might have passed very ne to the river into which they drifted, neih those on board or those on shore knew of  I proximity to each other.  ,  , although he ran well in along the  ,       .   peeping into every harbor, and even running under the very noses of the British fleet, at the mouth of Savannah Bay; he found nothing to gladden his heart, not even a single foe up- on which to vent his disappointment. On arriving at Oc-akok harbor, which he had appointed for his rendezvous with young Parsons in the prize, because of its utter isola- tion and being unfrequented by any vessels, except some straggling coaster, he found the transport at anchor. As soon as he came to, he was boarded by Chester, whose search had been equally unavailing. "I fear that they have gone to the bottom," sighed Seth. "I will not believe it yet," said Chester. "Those fishing boats are light and buoyant; Ruth understands managinga boat almost as well as I do, and the negro from   whom they took the boat told me that-there Was plenty of water and provisions on board. He said that'he had no compass, and did not know if they b!ad. Perhaps they have steered more to the south, and made the Cuban shore. or some island in the Bahama group." 4l don't believe they're lost,"' said Elijah, solemnly, "o for I haven't dreamed of it yet." "I will still hope," said Simeon. " 1 cannot believe that a good and just God will desert the innocent and the helpless." "Let me." suggested Chester,- 4 take my Vessel, and cruise downalong the Florida Reef, -thence across to Cula, and along its shores. Then I can run over and sight the Bahamas. If I do not see or hear from them, I may take a prize or two, for the ship sails well, and my Orew is plentv strong enough with Simeon's guard to man her batteries." Yes, brother Seth, do, and let me go with him, for I ieel a certainty almost, at least, a cheerful presentiment, that we shall be success- ful in our searert,' said Simeon. Seth shook his head sadly, but at last be yielded to the urgent entreaties of his brother and Cbester, and gave his consent. "Which way will you cruise?" asked Ches- ter. "To the northward, in the old track to New York. I muet not forget my duty to my btruggling country, even though my own pri- vate sorrows lay like lead upon my heart," *as the noble, but sorrowful, reply of the   young patriot. "We have proved a terror to the foe, so far, and the Thunderbolt must not lose her prestiget, or forget to send her light- nings amongst the minions of the tyrant king. Go on your cruise, and, successful or not, meet me in three or four weeks at New London harbor." Promising implicit obedience to orders, and also to be prudent, and not to rashy throw his price away, Chester, accompanied by Sim- eon, hastened on board the transport, and weighed anchor as quickly as possible. Soon, with all sail set, she stood out over the bar, and Seth, having put his prisoners ashore on their -parole, to enjoy the hospitality of the dealers in "* terpentine," prepared to continue his eruise. As the Thunderbolt headed for the north- east after crossing the bar, her captain could just see the transport, hull down and courses dipped, to leeward. Putting himself under easy sail for the night, for he was now in no hurry, only oruis- ing for a prize, he headed up the gulf-sad and disheartened, as he thought of the proba- ble fate- of' his sister. CHAPTER XXXI. Dreadfully dull was the Jerusha in hei sailing points. She had been out full a week before she reached the latitude of Ha teras, for Skipper Giles was very fond of keeping in sight of the land, and instead of running out and getting the benefit of the Gulf Stream, he kept inside of it, in the eddy, or counter-cur. rent, which is always there to be found. The girls were very weary, for the vessel was not provided with any books to amuse them with. But Lizzie and Ruth took a new idea in their heads, which very pleasantly oc- cupied,a good part of their time. It was the task of teaching Luliona to speak English. Commencing first, by teaching her to pro- nounce their names, and that of Saul, they then proceeded 'to teach her the names of the different articles of food, which they used, and such other things as met their eyes. She was very quick and apt, and aided, by the explan- ations of Lizze in Spanish, the daughter of Emathla made very rapid progress. With this, Saul was immensely delighted. "Jerusalem!" said he,l one day to Ruth, ,  i   "When Luly can only just hear me tell her  how I feel here, won't I hop right up and down t" As ie ha,1 one hand on his breast and the  other over his stomach, when he said this, a l mischievous person might have questioned where his feeling of joy would be located. Saul, too, had his occupation for pastime. He christened himself figllting-captain of t l, schooner, and when they were doing nothinz. which was their occupartion pretty hfuch all the time, lie would drill sancl of the crew, asi hbeojild get to muster, in the manual of armns. But as, like their skipper, they had a horror o loaded gurns, he had to put tlhem through the! drill with handspikes and broomsticks. nlie was so droll in his ways, and so generous in  his nature, that dry-hearted as they were, they could not I,xt like him. And General Wayi, had- told the sk;ipper so many stories of his reckless bravery and daring prowess in war, that he did lnut ddre to anger or cross hinm in any wany. SaDl lk;et i' 1 regllnar camp rules-he al ways sounde-l tl*, rcreille at d daybreak, with hs Trumlpet of Zon. which instrument, thouglh it jarr.,l t,1n Luit antl Lizzie's nerves, set mcd to delieht L:,liota. wlio never had heard any of our .4,fcr aiul uentler kinds of music Tliiiius ,rltrsed thus, until they were on tlheir e!.-v .nthl day out., when Captain Gilts "guessed" thwty were ab,llt up to the Capes of t'le Delaware,'for he "1 reckoned" the land looked like that about Indian river, etc. It was a- bright, clear morning, and very shortly after the "*second table' had hreal- fahted, Ruth. who was standing on the high quarte.-dtck, piointed to a sail which was bear- ing down on them, under a perfect cloud of canvas. No one else had seen it, for Skipper Giles and his crew considered that a look-out on board of a coaster was anysting but ortho- dox, and quite as unnecessary as the fifth wheel of a coach. The eyes of all hands were at once turned upon the strange vessel, and many and varied were the colujectures as to her character. She was square rigged, and coming from the northward, with the wind abaft her beam, while the Jeru ha was crawling along with her aheetA only a little eased off. Saul in his asumed capacity of fighting-   , =aptain, got out his war armament, and en- t deavored to get his squad to go to drilling in * preparation, should it indeed be an enemy who ! was bearing down on them. lie tried to induce I hi sisters to get out their arnms, butthey would not, although Luliona would not have required much urgingt to have assumed her bow and arrows, if Osle could only have understood his wishes. As the vessel drew near, it was plainly to be c,.tn that she was a large frigate, but now Caltain Giltes went to putting on "aire," and d-clared that lie knew her well, and that she wais an Anmerican man-of-war. On hearing tis, Saul rushed into the cabin, jand put on an old uniform coat, whichl General Wayne had given him, with epaulets on the shoulders. This, with his contiental. plumed t:tt, and his sword and bait, full of pistols, gave him a decidedly military appearanice: He care- fully repritimed his blldlrbuss nil musket, and laid them on the break of the cabin deck, to be, as he said, ready as the frigate approached, to H1re a salute. Ralidly the strange sail bore down, and when she was close aboard, her courses were clewedl up,' and her yanrds braced in, and she was thrown up in the wilnd right a head of the schooner. Thcn suddenly a puff of smoke first from a how gun, a thirty-two pound shot went whistling close past the scelooner's cut. water, and out from her pt,ak fluttered the broad folds of the ftlg of England, the cross of St George. "Maurciful sakes--my venture's gone, the schooner's lost, she's a Brltiher!" groaned Captain Giles, as he quit the helm, and ran below, leaving the schooner to come up in the wind, and lose what little headway she had. Saul instantly endeavored to muster the cj rew to arms. swearinpg that he wsould never ;yield to a Britisher, while a plank of the schooner floated on the water. But. the crew of the schooner followed the illutistrious example of thelir skipper, and sought safety helow. Ssul now forced his sister and the two other girls into the after-cabin, and fastened the door upon them, bidding them remain there, while he made "'terms," as he said, with t1ie enemy. One took, a proud, heroic look fromr Luliona^' flabhing eyes, made him doubly a hero, and ho   determined to show the Englishmen what grit i there was in Yankee stuff..       ! The frigate was now close aboard, and an p! officer hailed the schooner, through a trumpet, shouting:  A' Douse your sails, you Yankee lubber, and c heave too, or I'll send a shot into you, and  sink you!"  4 Send and be darned to you!" shouted Saul, I  in reply.  "Wee'll give-as good as you i send!"                  I And then he blew a blast so long and loud I upon his bugle, that those who heard it, might be excused, if they thought it was the trump of Gabriel rending the air. By the drift of the frigate. and the luffing of the unsteered schooner, the two vessels- were now brought into contact, the sclooner's two masts being tangled in the jib-boom- and bow-sprit of the other. I Board the infernal Yankee!" shouted the officer, who now stood on the top-gallant fore- oastle of the frigate, looking right down on Saul. Those words were the last he eve t uttered, for Saul had brought his musket to bear upon him, and a ball from it pierced ',is brain, and he toppled over, and fell dead upon the'schoon er's deck. in an instant, the forecastle was crowded with armed men, who began to descend the rigging of the schooner, while several shots were fired at Saul, who, however, remained untouched. Quickly, now, he seized his blunderbuss, and, as the foremost of the enemy reached the quarter-deck, he discharged the heavy load with fearful effect among them. Then, as others pressed on, his four pistols were used with a coolness of aim- which would have ,lon, :-.nor to any hero in the world; and for -very v-hot a Briton fell. lie row attempted to draw his sabre, gut a bullet through his left shoulder, and' another in his thigh, disabled him. and the fell. A dozen cutlases were raised above, his head, when he saw an officer among his assail- ants, and shouted-- - I surrender, and claim quarter, as an offi- Oer in the Continental army!" Struck with his dauntless bravery, and see- ing no other man on deck, th-, officer's sword   instantlyinterposed to save him, and struak liack the steel which'would soon have de- prived him of life. "Who are'you?'" cried the astonished offi- cer, as he' raised the wounded hero from the deck. "Captain Saul Sabberday, aid to General Wayne, of the Southern army "' said Saul, proudly. Where is the crew of this vessel?" "Gone below, like a pack of infernal cow- ards!" said Saul. "For them I ask no favors -hang 'em, if you like, for shooting is too good for them!" "But," he added, - I ask protection from you as an officer and a man; for my sister, and two other ladies, who are, like myself, pas- sengers on this vessel, and whom I was escort. ing to their homes!" ' Thevy sthll not be harmed!" said the offi- cer. - *We war not upon women. But did you alone defend your vessel? Did you alone do all that work?" and he glanced at six or seven dead men on -the deck, besides the officer, while several others were desperately wounded. "Yes, sir. I fought for terms!" said Saul, boldly. '"By heavens,! you sha I have terms, and bonorable ones!" said the officer. 1"I am one that can honor courage in a foe, as well as in a friend. But. we must take you on board of the frigate, where you shall be treated as a prisoner of war, with every couttesy due your rank and position. The schooner shall be sent into New York, and a safe-guard shall be given to your ladies, which. will protect them to their homes. " "I am contented. then," said Saul; " but I hope you will permit me to see my sister be-. fore I go on board of your vessel 1" ItCertainly, sir," said the officer; and he , gave orders to haw the recreant crew dragged * on deck, and to have the ladies conducted for- ward to Saul with every respect. 3  Pale, his knees knocking one against the , other, came Giles, followed by his crew, all equally craven as he. Dropping on his knees before the officer, he whined-- "Good Mister Cap'n, don't kill me. I tried - to keep that feller from ehootin', but he would 1 do it l"   "Clap those curs in double irons, and tum- ble them into the hold I'" said the officer to some of his men. scording even to speak to Giles; and then he bowed courteously to Ruth ana her companions, as they were led for- ward. * Oh, my brather-he is slain 1" screamed Ruth, as she darted forward toward him, see. inog the blood flowing from his wounds, which a eurgeon was now occupied in staunching. "No, lady, your brave brother is not in danger, though severely wounded l" replied the officer, kindly. *"Oh el;are his life!" moaned Ruth-," fora widowed mother's sake, spare itl" "He is a prisoner of war; and, for his cour- age in your defence, deserves every honor which a generous enemy can bestow on him. For his sake, though he is detained a prisoner, you shall be set free the moment that the schooner, on board of which I shall put an officer and prize crew, arrives in New York, and a free pass given to you to go to your re- latives and friends. We have suffered se. verely at the hands of your brother, but he fought for you and his country's honor " "We thank you 1" said the almost fainting girl. "Cheer up, sister-1'll soon be exchanged!" sail the undaunted Saul. *"Lizzie, tell Luly, there, to look on the quarter-deck, and see how I have fought for her!" Lizzie said a few words in Spanish to the Indian girl, but she closed her own eyes in horror, as she saw the fearful sight. But Lu- liona looked with curious wonder upon it, and then upon Saul, and her great dark eyes flashed with admiration, as she said, in one of the few English words which she had learned -"Brave--BRAnv  Sault" Those words, that look, was worth a thou- sand lives to Saul. He was a man now I No sign of idiocy was left in his face, and though faint with the loss of blood, his form seemed to dilate, and grow taller still. "Who is the captain of the frigate?" he asked of the officer. "He was," said the latter, pointing to the officer whom Saul had shot; *" but I am now. You have promoted me." "I'm not sorry for it, for you are brave and worthy I Your conduct shows it?" said Saul.   The ladies now were permitted to take a tender leave of Saul, and thten directed to re- turn to the cabin, where they would be treated with every respect. The prize officer was ap- pointed, and directions given him to take the vessel into New York, to set the ladies free, but to put the crew on board the prison-ship there. This last order pleased Saul particu- larly, for his contempt for Giles was unmeasur. ed. The body of the English captain was now hoisted on board the frigate, to he buried thence with the honors of war, but the corses of the seaman were, as usual,. pitched into the sea. Saul was carefully assisted on hoard, and - placed in a comfortable cot in the cabin of the frigate, and every care and kindness extended toward him. The two vessels now parted company, for the frigate was on a cruise, and had no occasion to go into port until she had taken a prize worth convoying. CHAPTER XXXTI. "We must never, never go into New York!" said Ruth to Lizzie, as the sluggish schooner crept slow8y'up along the Jersey shore, on the afternoon of the day when she was captured. "s Why? Are we not to be set free when we get there?" asked Lizzie. "Does thee not know that Benedict Arnold is there?" said Ruth. "Does thee think that a man so bold and bad as he will shrink from again seizing us?" "* Surely he will not dare to do it, with the guarantee which we have of safety." "' Yea, for he fears not God, man, or the devil I Honor is not within his breast. I re- peat that we must never enter that city! Bet- ter far we died upon the ocean!" *4 Oh, heavens I what woe is ours? We but escape one fearful peril to be involved in another," moaned the poer girl. "Be not a child," said Ruth, sternly; " but study with me some plan to possess ourselves of this veseel, for we are within two days' sail of home, and if no storm arises, alone I could carry her into port!" "What can we do?" asked Lizzie, utterly disheartened. "There are but seven Britons on board, six men and the officer," said Ruth. "They all seemed fond of liquor, for they drank eagerly   of the bottle which I gave them atnoon time." "* Well, what then?" asked Lizzie. 'Ttlee remembers the sleeping powders which those kind souls in Georgia gave us to still our nerves, and make us sleep after our dreadful journey; does thee not?" id I do," said Lizzie, quickly; "there is a package of them left." "Yea, but there will not be when the Bri- tons have drank another bottle of wine. Does thee understand me now?" "I do, I do. brave, dear Ruth!" said Lizzie, kissing her again and again. ,* Once more hope dawns upon my soul. But, Ruth, if this should fail?" "It will not; and, if it does, have we not our weapons. When they sleep, we will bind them fast, and then the vessel is our own, and soon again we will see our dear ones in New Lon- don, if they are there.'" Luliona, who could not understand these words, and was wondering what Lizzie meant by her excited actions, now addressed her in Spanish, and asked an explanation. Cautioning her to be calm, Lizzie, with Ruth's consent, revealed the plan, "It is good," was the reply. , "If the'sleep- powder does no good, then. Luliona have her bow and arrows.- There is a death in every barbed point 1" As night drew on, Ruth prepared the snp- per for herself' and companions, and made a present of a couple of bottles of wine to the officer and his men. These he received with a profusion of thanks, while no shadow of suspicion crossed his brow. One bottle he gave to his men, the other he reserved for- himself. It is scarcely necessary to say both were heavily drugged. An hour or more passed on. As the sun went down, the wind freshened, and drew out ,a little more fair, and the old schooner seemed' to take a new kink, and to go quite fast through the smooth water. A fair wind, and plenty of it, always cheers a sailor's heart, and the men of the prize crew seemed to enjoy their wine and song right merrily. And the, officer, for a while, hummed a merry tune, as with a lively step he strode to and tro upon the deck; 'but after a time the men ceased to sing, he walked no more, but sat down on the break of the deck, and leaned against the bulwarke, I             + .   And then, the man at the helm leaned drow. sily over the wheel, for his companions had not forgotten- to share their wine with him, though he could not leave his post. He grad- ually released his hold upon the spokes. and sunk in slumber on the deck, while the schoon- er's sails shivered in the wind as she luffed up. Ruth sprung to the wheel and put up the helm. The schooner's bow fell to leeward, the sails filled again, and once more she was bowling on in her course. Now came work for Lizzie and Luliona. Obeying Ruth'l'orders, they hurried to bind 'the officer and his stupefied crew so securely, that when they should be restored to con- sciousness, they would be unable to move hand or foot. This done, and well done, they dragged them to a sitting posture in front of the break of the quarter deak, and there lean- ing one against the other, they left them to enjoy the soothing influence of - Tirod nature's sweet restorer--balmy sleep." Meantime the wind freshened visibly, and though it had so hauled from off shore as to be fair, and give them smooth water under the lee of the-land, they had all the sail on the schooner which it was safe for her to drag- more indeed than Captain Giles would have dared to keep on her. On she went, pitching ahead with a rolling drift of foam under her bows, giving poor Ruth all that she could do to steer her upon anything like a steady course. At midnight. ]or a little after-atleast it was j some time before daybreak-numerous lights 'were seea on the weather bow and nearly ahead. Satisfied-that this was the Britsh fleet at or near Sandy Hook, Ruth caused the lights of the schooner to be put out, and then having the sheets eased off, she put up her helm and kept away more to the' eastward, so as to avoid them. Running more free, the Jerusha bore her canvas easier. ands sped on with in- creased rapidity, seeming fairly to outdo her- self. When day come at last, not a sign of a Ve-s. eel was to be seen astern .and they had run off out of sight of the land, though the color of the water, a pale green instead of a deep blue, showed that they were still on soundings. And now, as the British seamen and their officer awoke one after another, astonished and   mortified beyond description at their sitnu  tiru. there was a picture for a painter. Rt i It and Lizzie hal resumed their pistols when' the drugged wine began to work on the men, aTnd  Luliona had taken her quiver of arrows an1, her how from their resting place.    t The wind still freshened, and as she wisth- 1 to liff in toward the land, Ruth knew th*t  Fail must he taken in, and though in a smeal  boat she could have done it alone, she scarce'v know how to manage with so large a vessel "We must get one or two of the men up from below, Lizzie," said she. "Take off that front hatch, and call unto the Captain, and bid him crawl up on the deck!" "Surely, Ruth, you will not give that coward charge of the vessel again?" "Not I, Lizzie. but I will make him work!" said Ruth. "Do as I bade thee." Lizzie and Luliona now raised the hatch, and the former called upon Giles. A deep groan came up from below in reply. and then hiswhinning voice was heard. "Oh. good Mr. officer, don't murder us. We'll sarve the king, oranythingyou like. but spare our lives." "Crawl up on deck here and serve the king's betters!" said Lizzie. "Come, hurry up. or I'll find means to make yon." Another hollow groan came up from the sepulchral depths below-tomb of departed swine-flesh and baked beans innumerable- and then the pallid and cadaverous face of Captain Giles was seen above the combings of the hatch and the rattling of the irons on his hands sid feet was heard. Lizzie could not repress a smile as she looked upon his terror- stricken phiz. * Come, crawl up out of that, you old snail," said she, drawing her dirk and making a motion, as if she meant to tickle him under the ribs with its keen point Oh, don't, gal, don't stick that sticker inter m," he groaned. I'm a comin' as fastas I kin." And he crawled out on deck Speaking to the Indian girl in Spanish, Lizzie bade her prevent any more from coming up till further orders. In an instant Luliona had an arrow fitted to her bow-string, and when the mate raised his head to see what had become of his eaptain, and what was going on on deek, she was ready.   Put never did a land-turt-le draw its head hack into its shell before the pitiless stick of ,ocrl tormentirg boy, than did he dodge back ,nd squat when he saw the point of her arrow 'most at his eye, and she drawing that arrow to a head u on h  tough lance-wood bow. Her flashing eyes, compressed lip, and form bent forward, and resting on her left foot, told him what she meant, and he was non est in a little less than the flutter of a pigeon's wing. "Why, gals, hev you got the schooner in your hands agin?" said Captain Giles,-as he finally arose from a horizontal to a perpen- dicular position, and gazed upon the row of Englishmen securely bound. "By jiminetty, my 'venture's safe yet. The schooner's not lost-hooray--hooray!" ", Lower down that foresail, and keep thy tongue between thy teeth, if thee knows when thee is well off!" said Ruth, sternly. "How kin I do it with these 'ere on," said Giles. looking woefully at the irons on his limbs. "Lizzie, get a hammer, and see if thee can- not remove them " said Ruth. "And mark thee, Lizzie, if he hesitates to do my bidding. remember thee that thee has a pair of loaded pistols in thy belt, and thee knows how to use them!" "Aint I captain of my own schooner?t shined Giles. ",Thee has no schooner!" said Ruth, indig- nantly. "Thee wouldn't fight for it like my brave brother, and. dastard that thee is, tried to east blame on him. while thee plead for thv own worthless life. Thee has no right to this schooner; it is the lawful prize of that officer there. and when I have come to land wl etite I can reach my home. I shall deliver 'p' '*^ prize and prisoners to him. t did not xi i-h?., land in New Yore. or I should not hav" '4Itd- as I have 1" r  ( Oh. gosh-nation! don't do that. if I toeis m' m  ventur', and the schooner, I'm ruiln d" groaned Giles. r  * Ruin is all that thee deserves!" said tibe i indignant Quakeress. "Thee thinks of nothing v but thyself!" e  The British officer, wh* had before felt too s much mortified to speak, was not a disinterest- e ed listener to this colloquy. "L dy," said he, in a respectful tone, ii U   you wil release me and one of my men, I will pledge my honor, as an English officer and a gentleman, to make no attempt to retain the vessel, but to safely navigate her to any port that you desire, and if you will indeed do as you have said to that sneaking coward there, you will save my honor, and probably my com- mission, and have the grateful thanks of my wife and children, who depend upon my pay for their support Let the rest of my men re- main confined as hostages-I have no weapons, and you have. Even should you not trust to my honor, you can shoot me down if I show a sign of treachery!" "Thee speaks truly there!" said Ruth, who seemed to be studying his features closely, and thinking of his proposition. "Don't listen to the creeter 1" whined Giles. "Only jest let me and my men out of these ere shackles, and we'll throw the Britishers over- board, and then take you right to Boston!" A painter, skilled ip the limner's undying art, should have been there to have caught the expression of Ruth's indignant, scornful face -to have given it immortality on the canvas. "Would thee murder men' who are bound and helples?" she said, in a tone too bitterly contemptuous to be described. "Why, thee wouldkill a babe in its cradle; sell the honor  of a sister, and steal the coins that pressed  down the eyes of a dead mother. I would  give thee the fate thou hast named for them, did I not believe I should cheat the hangman of his due Lizzie, touch not his shackles, but drive him down into the hold again, and then set that officer and one of his men free!" "Don't you, gal-don't you, for the Lord o' mercy's sake!" groaned Giles, in abject terror. "I love I Down to your den again 1" said Lizzie, and once more the point of her dirk was in close proximity to his ribs. ' I can't-I can't! Oh, my ventur' oh, my schooner 1" groaned the dastardly skipper. "' Ouch! Don't-don't, it hurts!" he screamed, s Lizzie gently, reminded him that her wea- pon had a point, by slightly prodding him in the side. "Move, then!" said the determined girl. Fearing another prick, Giles. commenced hacking toward the hatchway, and arriving, in his retrogade movement, at the comabiug be- fore he expeetd, ht tripted by the heels, and,   capsizing backwards, disappeared .in the hold. among his groaning crew. The hatch was now put on, and then Lizzie at once unbound the officer, and a seaman whom he chose, whilethe Indian girl took her place, with her arrow still ready, by the side of Ruth, seeming intuitively to understand the position of affairs, and the necessity of being on guard,. "I will first take a reef in the sails!" said the officer, " and then I will relieve you at the helm, lady!" "' Do as thee thinks best, for I trust thee!" said Ruth. -"I wish to go to New London, and I think we are pretty well along on the Long Island shore now, for I am sure we passed Sandy Hook in the night" " ' Then, when 'I have reefed, I will luff in shorel The entrance to New London is at the upper end of the Sound, I believe!" said the officer. "Thee is right," repliedRuth. "When thee gets there, I will show thee where thee can land us with safety to thyself, and then thee can take the prize to New York by the Sound!" The officer now went cheerfully to work, and soon had the schooner under proper canvas, then, requesting Ruth to luff her up in the wind, so as to shake the sails, he trimmed aft  the sheets, then took the helm, and luffCl in for "Long Island's sea-girt shore." And thus we will leave the Jerueha forka while, and steer away south to take another "observation" in that direction. CH APTER XXXIII. Patiently and carefully, relaxing not in vig- ilance, by night or by day, and favored with, fresh and fair gales, Chester Parsons ran down the Florida coast and reefs in his vessel, then crossed to Cuba's fragrant shore, and examined each river, bay, and inlet, speakingevery oast- er that he met; then he threaded the dreaded shoals and labyrinthine channels of the Ba- hamas; and in those waters took two valuable prizes, one of which be sent home. The other he unloaded, transferring her cargo to his own, eossel, and then, Dearly dismantling her, he put his prisoners on board, and left them to make  their way to the nearest port ia best they could, for he cared not to be troubled with   them. nor daed he to weaken his crew more than he-had done when he sent home his first prize. But unwearied as had been his search, and untiring his inquiries, nothing could be hear of those for whom, with all of a brother's and a lover's devotedness, he sought. Even Simeon began to despair, and, as they turned their prow up the Gulf Stream, home. ward-bound, he said: *' Ob, Chester, how can I meet my mother, and say that Ruth is lost?-how meet poor Widow Hale, now utterly childless?" Little did he dream that even at that hour Lizzie and Ruth were far nearer to those whom he dreaded to'meet than he was. Nor more sad was he than Cheater. The heart of that brave young man had known but two loves-Ruth and his country. With the wind fair and strong, and flowing tocks and sheets, the transport made rapid way to the northward, and in three days from the time that he last sighted the eastern point of Abaco, Chester's latitude at noon made his position to be upon a line with Cape Hatteras. As he hauled in, intfrin'g to sight the land to the northward of the cape, the look-out aloft announced a sail, square-rigged and close-haul- ed, heading to the southward ' Chester was not the man to ran ftr a single foe, at least, if there was the slightest chance ofuooeess; and he waa determined to close with the stranger. and see what he was, before he varied from his course, depending on. the speed of his vessel for flight, if it should prove to be With a stiff breeze, and a tolerably smooth a, the vessels very rapidly neared each other. The one coming from the north, soon told by her rig and the cut of her sails that 8he was English; but aa her hull was entirely black-- so white streak or port-holes visible-Cheater took her to be some merchantman or trans- port like his pwm But, when within half a mile, the vessel suddenly took in her light sails to trim ship for action, and triced up two tiers of port*, showing herselfto be a heavy double- bnked frigate, he regretted that he had not rewembered Seth's lat warning, and been  ,litte more prudent He hastened to take in his studding-sails, so a to haul on a wind, but it war too late to fly *    hoad no ohoioe but to fight ow tin lyp-   tender witLout a blow. This he was in no bumor to do, nor were his crew more inclined 'than he for the horrors of a prison-ehip; so, quickly clearing ship for action, he edged away in shore, hoping to keep up a running fight, and, if possible. to get his vessel into shoal water, and beach her before the frigate' could take her. The latter, with ensign and- penrnant flying, soon opened the hall by heaving a shot across his. fore-foot. as an order to heave too. Up went Chester's Yankee flag, and a broad- side from his battery-feeble, indeed, when compared with that of his opponent, but well aimed an! given-told the Briton thdahe would notstrike his colors without a struggle. Then came the rattling shot, crashing and splintering through his bulwarks in reply. Sails and spars gave quick token of the heavier metal of the foe. But stripping to the waist, the privateersmen fought more like demons than like men, cheered on by their intrepid leader, and by Simeon, who, with his marks. men, made great havoc on the crowded decks of the enemy, as he closed within musket-shot. But the odds in guns and men were more than ten to one-it seemed utter madness still to contend. But yet the Americans fought on un- til every spar was shot away, the hull pierced in an hundred places, more than half their crew killed or disabled, Simeon and Parsons both badly wounded, and the cry was beard that the ship was sinking  Both vessels had drifted and worked in toward the land, until it could be plainly seen to the west. Then, when Chester was told that his ship was sinking, did he consent to have his flag hauled down; and deeply did he regret it a moment after, for he saw a brigantine in the eastern offing which he knew to be the Thunderbolt, the moment that his eyes rested upon her. The boats of the frigate soon carried Chester and Simeon. and all that was lefttof their crew, on board the frigate, but scaree had they left, the transport, when she went down to rise no more-at once a wreck and a eoffin for her dead. The frigate had not escaped scot-free. Her rigging, sails, and spars, had been dreadfully out up by the short but rapid fire of the trans- port, and before preventer stays. could be set up, her mainmast went by the board, arrying   with the fore and mizzen top gallantmast, and the -fore-topmast. She, too, was alinost an unmanageable wreck upon the waters. Chester and Simeon -were received with kindness and respect by the commander of the frigate, for he honored their brave detence against senb fearful odds. In every true sail- or's breaet, as in thaft of a gallant soldier. there is a svmpatetic fire of admiration, which ever flames for a brave, thoogh unfortunate enemy. The two wounded of icer s were carried into the captain's cabin, attended by that officer and his surgeon. A person. clad in the Conti- nental' utiform; was limping about the cabin when they entered. his face wearing anything but a pleased look. But when he saw them, his countenance changed, and he shouted: "'Jerz sa'lem I' Why, it's Chet- Parsons and brother Simeonh. captain of W'ashington's Life G,uard!"  Then nltering his joyous tone, he said in a bitter accent, "What did you strike your colors for? You haid men and gnns, and no women to take care of I Why didn't you fight to the last gasp? I fought this friaute single handed, my  crew all skulking below, and three women for me to think of; fought her for "* terms,. and got 'em, too f" *' What on earth do you mean?" exclaimed Simeon. "He will explain-- I don't want to talk to men that give up while there's a sho t left to ram down a gun!" said Saul, pointing to the English captain. "' Their vessel is sunk. and they lave fought with bravery almost as dangerous as yours was!" said the Enelishman, and then he gave and received explanations which brought all hands to an understandinga joyous one an the part of the two officers last wounded. when they heard that Ruth and Lizzie yet lived. But when Simeon heard that, they were to be ]and. ed in New York, a  cloud came over the sunny gleam of transient pleasure, for he remembered that,Armo/d was there. and he knew that they were more than lost if he should happen to learn of their being in tlat city. While the surgeon "was yet dressing the wounds of the captured officers, a lieutenant hastened into the cabin, and addressing the British eommnander, said: 'TTe, brigantine, sir, which was sighted at the elo" of the action, has shortened sail and 1,    I hoisted- Ameriean colors. She is heavily. t armed, and seems preparing for action!" "How near is she " asked the British cap- tain. "Nearly three miles distant, sir; but she shows an enormous pivot gun. and six heavy, guns on a side," replied the. lieutenant, At that instant 1he crash of a heavy shot, piercing the bulwarks of the frigate, was heard 1 "Too near for us in our condition-leanr for action quickly as you can!" said the English commander, nervously.,  "Hooray foi brother Sethb By Jehosophat I - it's the Thupderbolt!" cried Saul, who at, the first report of the gun, had gone to the port or the after gun, and looked out. "Is the commander of thiat vessel indeec your hrother?" asked the officer of Simeon. "Yes, sir'; I recognized his vessel when we were brought on board!" ! *Then 1 must hurry to my post, for hard! fighting seems to run in your family!" said the officer, trying to ceonceal his unseisiness under a smile, but in vain, Then, turinir to his surgeon. he said: ', Have these wounded gentlemen conveyed below, sir, out of dan- ger!^ *Darn me, if 'm going below.   I'm going to stay on deck and see the fun I' said Saul.  At  that iistant, a second shot from the Tholtherholt entered the very port throlgh which hA had been looking but a morment bB- fore. and  dismounting  the opposite gun, crashed through the vessel into the sea be* youd. As they could not be combatants, Simeonu and Chester made no- objections to being eap ried helow, where their men were alrea)y con- fined, bIut aul followed the Briiish cominmtund. er out on deck, as well as he eould ; hbt. thlere he had the sense io restrain his exsltaor lu; so far as wordo went, though  he could not hidt the color wiich rusbhed to hie cheek, nlr 'the triumlpfhaut,.lfah of his eye.

He was seen by tthe British covo Iander, who urged him 'togo below.  *No, dr  Let me  stay here if yon please said Saul,-  "* You attend to your fighting. air d pitch in the hard knock, or brother 4t3t wtid   lick you like fun I He's in right down earnest,' I tell you; look at that!" The last ejaculation was caused by a round dhot, which came crashing through the bul- warks, forward, killed three men, and sunk deep in the heavy foremast "By thunder, I should think he was in ear- nestl" muttered the British officer, as he i changed his position and issued some more orders The Thunderbolt. when she fired her first gun, was about three miles from the frigate. and entirely out of effective range of the. guns of the latter. But Seth was new rangiog  ahead, and trying to obtain a raking position, which brought him about half a mile nearer the frigate, whose guns now could be brough, to bear on him, but not so as to do him much bharm. He had seen the battle between the figate and transport, and had recognized the Iater, and he knew that his brother and Ches. ter were either slain or prisoners, and he was determined to take the frigate or be sunk by bar. Another shot from his long gun reached the damaged foremast. and it'went by the board. The frigate now was utterly unmanageable, and the brigantine was laid right across her bows, raising her, at her own distance, with' every shot. The havoc on, the frigate's deck was dreadful; the red life-blood ran in-treams from the scuppers, the cock-pithelow was full of wounded and dying men I Nearly every officer but the brave commander was either wounded I or killed; but he and Saul, both equally expos-  ed, seemed to possess charmed lives, for neither ' were touched, though both were repeatedly pattered with the blood and brains of men killed claoe beside them. Nor did Saul seem to be the least disturbed. When a shot struck the frigate, he would over his glass and look to see what it had done ; when the frigate fired from the only two bow guns which she could bring to bear, he would, with eurions interest, watch the effect f tAir hot At loat an officer, who had already been badly wounded by splinters, came up from the (a-deek, and told the commander that he eould keep the men at their guns no longer. Moe th    half were killed, many more disa- bbd., sveral of the gun were dismounted, and    he was the only officer still able to do duty on that deck. The British captain saw that it was impossible for him to escape, or to win the victory But his national pride would not let him willingly yield to aforceso inferior. lis honor se tmed to be at stake. While yet ie hesitated in his reply, to his officer, who was as brave and devoted a man as ever wore a sword, -a shot came crashing through the iow port, knocked one of the guns from its carriage, and, splitting into many fragments, 'carried death to a dozen men, one of whom, -was the officer who was speaking to him, i whose skull was crushed by a ragged portion of the shot. Another part of it knocked the spy-glass which Saul held to his eye into flin- ders, and just grazed the head of that indi- vidual, as hewas lowering the glass to see the effect of the shot. "Your spy-glass is spoiled, cap'n, but!"i buy you another when we get into port!" said Saul. coolly taking off his hat to see if that had sustained any injury. The men now fled below, leaving the guns, whichi they could not work. "Oh, God, why can I not die, and avoid this liegrace!" groaned the brave Briton. "Don't talk of dying, cap'n," said Saul. "You've fought as well as Gin'ral Washing- ton could, himself! You talk of our being hrave. Why, you're as brave as old 'mad Anthody Wayne, and he isn't afraid of man nor the devil-hoofs, horns, and tail, com- plete!" "' You may go and haul down my flag, Captain Sabberday, I canrobt do it myselfl" sRr,i the officer, covering his face with his tands to hide his emotions * I can't, cap'n; don't take on so. I don't want to hurt your feelin's," said Saul, almost crying. "If that wasn't my brother's brig, darn me if I wouldn't fight for you, myself!" The British commander, touched with Saul's noble feeling, reached out his hand to him, to express, by his grasp, the feelings that he could not utter And that very motion, probably, saved Saul's life, for a round shot from the Thunder- bolt knocked away the davits to which the boat was hungt and Saul would have gone overboard with the boat, had not the strong arm of the officer pulled him in on deck   "JerusalemI but 'they go it strong!" said Saul, as he gathered himself up, and looked for the boat in which he had be'en sitting. But it was gone. The officer now saw tl   was o   a reckless waste of life to carry on the action, and with, perhaps, more sorrow in his heart than he had ever known before, he gave orders to one of the few men left, who stood by him, to haul down the tattered flag which still hung from his- mizzen peak. Not a shot was fired after this from the brig, but three cheers were horne down on the wind from her deck, as she filled away and ran down under the lee of her prize. As soon as the Thunderbolt rounded to, a poat was lowered, and Seth sprtlnag into it, in beraon, to go on board of his prize, and take, possession. As he reaclhed the frigate', deck, her gallant commantder stepped fovrward, and, offering him his sword. said: "Sir,' I hope you will bear witness that I have defended my ship as long as I could ; she was not fit for action when you engaged 1" "Brother Seth, if you touchi to take that sword, I'll never speak to you again. while  I live I' cried Saul. '"He's the bravest man I that lives, 'eptinug Gin'ral Washington 1" E "So b'rave a man shall never be required to t surrender his sword to me!" said Seth, extend- 1 ing his hand to the vanquished officer i, While t I rejoice at my own good fortune, I regret to t say that it has been achieved at the expense of T such a loss to you, sir P!' " The tears were in the Briton's eyes, but not 1 unmanly are such tears. He could only say: - ; "Your generosity only equals your courage. v I Here is- one brother, another is in safety below, c and you may well be proud of tlheir hero- h ism!. Seth tried, by kindness, to soften his hard- ii ship, and gave orders to have the surgeon se come aboard from  the Thunderbolt, to assist ta in attending the wounded.         ra All that night was spent by him in properly S securing  and attending to his prisoners-in of rigging jury-masts to get the frigate into port with, and in explanations with Saul, Simeon, 0 and Chester.  And 'the American crew viedl fi with their commander in kind attention to the he Englishmen, thus softening the rigor of their he defeat, and lessening their regrets.    e a   d  How strange it is that those who, but a few d hours before, have met in deadly strife, fer0- t ciously seeking each other's lives, can, when the heatof the conflict is over, meet like bro- a thers, and shareall that each possesses. Yet, , so it is, for I have seen it. ;  As soon as the frigate was got into sailing s trim. or into the best trim that come-at-able , materials afforded, Seth, leaving Chester in Icharge, and taking the English commander on board of his own vessel, made sail to the southward, heading up for the' capes of. Vi-. ginia, determining to get the frigate into Now folk, which was his nearest port. Fortune still smiled upon him, for the wind hauled out fresh from  a favorable quarter, and, within about forty hours from the time when her flsag , was hauled down, his prize was safely at anchor in an American harbor. Thie reader can itnagine the congratulations which were showered upon him at every hand, and  his ow n pride, as he communicated the, important captpre to the government. Sim- eon was now permittejd to hasten with his men to rejoin his beloved ce)ief, and Saul, too, with full accounts of his intrepid deeds, and a new horse, given to tim by a  gallant Virginian, started for -headquarters, fully armed and equipped, though he " willed," as' he said, his blunderbuss and musket to his brother Seth, btecause he  could not carry them. But no. thing could induce him to part with his, Trum- pet of Zion"-it had sounded the charge at White Plains-blown a blast o01 triumph at Yorktown, frightened the last of Emathla's warrior band to death, or thereabout, and he vowed that it never should leave him until he could blow a  pran of joy over the news of an honorable peace for America. The crew of the English frigate were placed in comfortable quarters, under guard, on shore, to wait for an exchange, and her cap- tain was allowed to go to New York on his pa role of honor not to serve against the United States, until regularly exchanged for an offieor of equal rank. Poor fellow-the exchange was never made. On his arrival at New York, he was so mort. fied by the reception which he met at the hands of the British commander-in-chief, when he related his misfortune, that he who had es. caped an honorable death, when he actually   sought for it, went down upon the Battery and blew out his brains in despair. Seth, however, did not hear of this until long afterward, and when he did, he regretted that he bhad allowed the brave officer to go on his parole. for he respected and admired him. Beth re-fi,ted his brig thoroughly in Nor- folk, shipped more men in place of those whom he had lost. and onem more Set sail, bound on a orluse, and for home-thhat is, as soon as he could take a prize, for seldom did he go into port without one. CHAPTER XXXIV. When we left the Jerusha, managed by the English prlze master and one of his crew, but under the aharge- of Ruth and her beroic com- panions, whose misifortunes seemed only to be conquered that they might be renewed, she wat luffing up for the Long Island shore, with a fresh breeze, and every prospect, should it hold, of being in the harborf of New London before many hours were passed. And right well it held for a long time; by noon the land was sighted, and she howled merrily along the coast. Ruth, with her com- panions, was delighted with their progress, and when, near the hour- of sunset, she saw and reeognised Block Island and Montsuk Point, hier delight knew no hounds. Often had she been out there in sail boate, from her earliest childhood, until the commencement of the war, and no pilot on the coast knew the courses in better than she did. By the time the sun went down, they were all up in the mouth of the channel that en. ters the Sound, and Ruth had given the proper course to the officer for steering- in between Block Island and Montauk. But suddenly, aS it by magic, the wind ceased, and the vessel tosed idly on the heavy ground swell, her old oanvas flapping to and fro upon her creaking masts, and gaffs. and booms, as if it would burst from its half rotten bolt-ropes. And all, as suddenly as the westerly, or rather the southwesterly wind, had ceased, a dark, heavy bank of clouds arose in the east, and soon a heavy swell from that direction came rolling in, foretelling all, too truly, that a heavy gale was rising in that quarter. The officer looked at it. then at the miserably rigged and found schooner, and shook his head. That   there was perils, with rocks and shoals under their lee, and a dark night before them, he knew. Ruth saw his anxiety, and bade him frankly tell her if he thought that their danger was imminent. ** If we had the day before us, it would not be, lady!" said the officer, respectfully. "But with a htavy storm rising, a root-hound coast, to me unknown, under our lee-tides aad cur- rents setting we know not how-no chance to see a danger until we are plump upon'it, I must say that peril, great peril, is before us t" "Thee will need all the men, will thee not, to manage the vessel?" asked Ruth,-who had- seen that those who were hound had been given food and drink during the day. "I shall need every man. lady ; yet, if you do not fully trust me, I will do the beat I ean without them!" replied the officer. ' I trust thee-unloose thy men, and do all that thee thinks best to meet the emergency. I can tell the course which thee must steer from this point; in my judgment, to reach the light that is at the mouth of the river Thames, on which New London stands, or stood, before the traitor Arnold burned it. If thee steets from hence, a due course of westsnorth-west, thee will pass safely between the PI im Island and the Gull Islands, leaving Gardiner's Island ar to thy loft. If thee can keep that course, and no currents sweep us from the channel, we are safe, for there is only Pine Island beyond, and we are almost in the harbor when we get to that!" "* I will steer the course you name, lady, and beyond that we must trust to luck 1" "*Not to luck, but to Providencei" said Ruth, quickly. "I am corrected, and justly l" said the of. ficer, is he loosed his men and appointed them to their stations, to which they proceeded sul- lenly, and evidently in a bad mood. Lights in the binnacle, aloft, and in the bows, as well as in the cabin. were now required, for, with the gathering alouds, the darkuess increased rap- idly. Yet lazily, and with a sickenmng sameness, the schooner rolled and tossed, with no wind to steady her. Eight, nine, ten o'clook paised, and yet no change. Wrapped in their msa- ties, but wakeful, and witching every motion, keeping their arms ready for instant use, the   thre heroines sat near the helmsman on the transom -plank, waiting for the expected storm. Suddenly,; Luliona started from a listening attitude, and said to Lizzie- "I hear the sound of mounted warriors on the war-path--the rush of many. steeds over- the prairie!" Lizzie listened, and told Ruth. what the In- dian girl had said, but they heard Nothing. "She is dreaming of her southern- home!" Wid Ruth. "I hear the sound of many waters, as if a flood' had broken loose from a mountain-side!" said Luliona again. ' It is but the dash of the surf on the dis- tant shore!" replied Lizzie.  "I hear -the sound of a tempest in the for- est-the great trees bend, and writhe, and groan.'" "Stand by to take in all sail but. the jib!" shouted the officer, at this instant, with start- ling earnestness. ,Though his ear was not so quick aP that of ttn Indian girl. he had now dibtinctly detected the sound of the approach- ing storm. So, indeed, by this time had Ruth and Lizzie. "Clear away the halliards. let go and haul down fore and mainsails," cried the officer. Creaking, catching and holding, coming down by jerks and' hitches, the old sails were at last taken in, and not an instant too soon, for before they were half furled to the booms, the hurricane came with a sound that dead. ened all other sounds! It brought before it a perfect -wall of foam. from which blinding sheets of epray were driven even as -leety tnow from the drift's hieb crest,. It came from right astern, and-as it fjlu. ed the elhoone P huge jib, she seemed to se-ttle right down for- ward, but not to move ta, inch ahead. *'Sbe'll drive un ler-she'll drive under-" shouted the look-out forwardt who was up to his knees in water. - Y, t. his words could scarcely be heard ten fr et from him. But shuddenly, with a report like that of a eannon, the jib burst from Its bolt ropes, and waa in a second rent in a thousand shre.;s.- Then the sehc(uer rose, and under her bare epars scudded off with .fPartul speed for her The wind and seas teeertd to catctl; under 4her high stern and actually to heave and pitch her   forward. The men cowered down beneath the lee of the cabin and shuddered, for so heavy was the gale that the bare masts bent to its forcet and seemed as if they would fall over the bows. The maidens crouched be- neath the high taffrail and clung to the iron rod or " traveler' upon which the wing of the lower- main-sheet traversed, when th Bail - was set, lest they should be blown away. ' With one strong and trusty man to aid him, the otineer, however, nobly stood to his post at the helm. With hia eye kept steadily upon the corupass in the binnaqle, he strove to keep 'the schooner the course which Ruth had given him. At times, though, he would peer ax.- iouslv forth in the darkness, as if hoping to catch a glimpse of some friendly beacon light which might guide them to a safe harbor. Advice or information from, Ruth he could not Eet' now, for in the hilak and mad tur- moil o'f winds and wfaves no voice could be hlsaid Only hy signs could any communica. tion he made.  On-on thev drove, over the dark waters, amid-thhe howling gale, foam behind and gloom before. Even the flashing lightning would have been welcome, then, for by its red glare tlev might have seen and avoided dangers which they mlost dr,-aded, because they could not see thr-n. though tlheyknew-they existed. It requires tuore courage to hear that which we see not, yet is--thau to meet a thousand perils in the lighti of das.

"Give me one of your pistols!" cried the officer. "I'll fetch him to!" "I cannot give it thee to take away life with, but if thee wants it thee can take it 1" said the ever scrupulous Ruth. The officer snatched one from her belt, took Aim, and pulled the trigger- But no flash fol- lowed-the priming was wet. "Guess that rain spiled your shutin' irons last night," said Giles, as he rowed on, and, turning a point, was soon out of sight. Upon examination, Ruth and Lizzie found indeed that both firearms and ammunition had been rendered useless by the storm. But while they mourned this mishap, Luliona show. ed them her strong, yet pliant bow, and her quiver full of arrows, and smiled as she said: ' My sister need not be afraid-Luliona has fifty deaths within her quiver; her arm is strong, and her heart knows no fear!" "What are your men doing?" asked Ruth, as she saw them gathered around a hogshead, which they had rolled out from the split hull of the shattered wreck. "Heavens, they have go at the rum!" said the officer. "They must not be allowed to drink, for it will madden them, and they are al l ess for my control now." He then jastily hurried down to the spot where the men stood, some fifty or sixty yards distant, and remonstrated with them, endea- Voring to dissuade them from rendering them. selves incapable of building a taft, upon which they could reach the main land. "You go and attend to your petticoats, and get your fill of 'em while you can!" shouted one of the boldest of the men; 't It will be our turn with them by and by!" The officer was maddened by the insolence of the wretch, and especially by the last words which lie uttered, which were too plain to conceal their infamous and dreadful import, and he struck the mutinous villain down with his clenched hand. But he never struek a blow again-the man was on his feet in a se- oond, and, drawing a sheath-knife from his belt, he rushed upon the unarmed officer, The latter turned to look for a club, or something to use in his defence, and the man, faking foul advantage of his movement, drove the knife   deep into his back. The officer fell, and the assassin repeated his blows, until life was ex- tinct, and the unfortunate officer, ceased to straggle, Sdeing the officer fall by this treacherous blow, and feeling that he was their last friend and protector, Lulioua quickly fitted an arrow to her bow, and in an instant more the murder- er would have laid beside his vietim, had not Ruth caught her arm and exclaimed : "Lizzie, tell her not to use her arrow-we must only take life in self-defence, and the death of one will only madden the rest, and drive them to desperate acts. Rather let us fly back into the recesses of the woods, and hide from them until they are stupified by the liquor which they will drink, and then we can make a raft, and trust ourselves once more upon the waters. With a flood-tide, we sure- ly may drift toward the main, whence jve can be seen, and whence help may reach up." It was hard to restrain the Indian girl, for she chafed like an angry tigress-her eyes flashed, her form dilated, her white teeth grated one against the other, and she said- ' Blood for blood! He ought to die " But the gentler counsel of Ruth and Liz- zie prevailed and she was led away, while the chief mutineer waved his bloody knife above his head and shouted- * I'm captain now, boys; fill up your cups, and drink to my health. We'll seize the first craft that passes, decoy her in by a signal of distress, and then turn pirates. I'm not afraid, as my last act will show you. Come, drink, and get a little more of the devil in you, and then we'll bave some fun with the women. I claim the yellow-haired one, for she's the sau- diest and the handsomest. You can share the other two amongst you. Come, drink, and be merry!" The wretch drained a cup full of Giles' ac- cursed rum, and the others, with demoniac cheers, hailed him as their chief, and, fillinq their cups with the fiery liquor, poured it down their throats.  , "' Where are the women?" asked one of the men, observing that they had suddenly dieap- peared, * Only gone to hide somewhere; but we'll hunt 'em out after we've got devil enough in us. Drink, boys, drink-their screams 'll   bound like mus'e in your ears if you have plenty of rum in you; I know that by expe- rience. Fill up your cups again, and I'H spin you a yarn that'll show whether I'm fit to be a pirate captain or not-a story about. what drove me-me, the son of a nobleman-to be- come a common sailor, a vagabond, and a wanderer, roving from land to land, an exile from my lordly father's roof, under a name that is not my own. Drink, drink, I say," shouted the newly-elected captain. "Fill up, boys, andhear Bill 8yke's story!" cried one of the band. Again the brimming cups went around, and then the crew waited for the yarn. The man whom they called Bill Sykes, was a tall. muscular, well-formed man, of not over thirty-five years. His features would have been fine, had they not been marred by the effects of dissipation, and sears which be had probably gotten in fierce and reckless enconn- ters. But his expression was thatof a harden- ed an,] desperate man, whom no remorse could touch-with no pity in his soul, no mercy in his heart. "* I told you I was the son of a nobleman, boys!" said he, as he drained his cup; "and no I am t  a younger son, though; and an elder brother revels in luxury, or even now per- chance wears the title that I have as good a right to as he has. But I have had some satis- faction out of him-took it in advance He loved a girl that lived near our mansion, who was as like that yellow-haired girl that I'm , going after directly, as one bean is to another. d ( She was a   clergyman's only daughter, and 1 pretty enough to form a subject for her father ] to study when be was going to preach about ] the angels. Well, she was as winning in her i ways as she was handsome, and what did I do  but fall in love with her clear out of sound. ings. I could hardly eat for thinking of hr, 1 and finally, to make the story short, for I'm u getting dry over it, I1 told her that I loved her, I and even offered to marry her t      t "But the infernal minx had the impudence to tell me that she already loved my brother, o and that he loved her in return. "I raved like a fool, and told her my father a would never let my brother marry her-told ti her I could not live without her, and all that She very ooolly told me that she knew of my f   e dissipated habits, that my brother had told - her of them, and that she wished never to re' a ceive a visit from me again, either as a vnsiter e or a lover. t  "Then the sleeping devil woke in my ns- - ture. My love changed to hate, and I swore a a fearful oath-one which made her try to e shut her ears to my words, and to fly, shriek- e ing, from my presence-that he should never ' revel in her charms-that she, who would not be my wife, should be a thing aohorrent to herself and to the world. "1 Ha. ha, ha! How well I kept my oath. She dared not tell my brother what had passed between us, but she kept herself beneath her father's roof so closely that I could get no opportunity to carry out my   plans. She never went abroad, except upon the Sabbath, when attended to church, and the people of the whole country were about; though, before I made my threats, she used often to wander in our park, in the deep and shady groves, to gather flowers there, and, for all I know, to meet my brother. "Finding that I couldn't expect to get her out while I stayedS around, I determined to . come a ruse upon her, as the Fjenel say ; and so, I raised funds from my father, and told him that I was going to travel for a year or two on the Continent. As my wild tricks and dissipations not only made me an annoyance to the neighborhood; but also drew too fre. quently on his purse, my expressed determi- i nation pleased him. and was a great relief to others. But I  did not go far, though I had a thousand pounds in my pocket, and, could have traveled half the world over with that. I disguised myself so that no one could reaog- nise me, and remained at a village inn not far off, watching for my chances. "  I soon found that the girl, believing that I was far away, no longer kept herself housed up in her father's study, but once more took her solitary rambles over the fields, and through the groves. "*Come. fill up, boys-fill up --the cream of my story is yet to come." The wretch filled and drained his own cup, and the rest did the same. Then he con- tinued : "One day-a lovelier day was never seen, for it was in leafy June, and the birds were   singing, and the sun was shining upon green grass and bright flowers-while I was watch  ing her father's house from a shady grove not far from it, I saw her come forth, directing her steps toward that very grove. I retreated back within its shadowy recesses, and she, all unconscious of my vicinity, followed the -very path I had taken. At last, afer I had got so far in'that I could no longer -see the house, I -came upon a little arbor madte by bending hazel bushes together at the top. Honey- suckles haed been planted around it, and these were now in bloom and twining in fragrant loveliness over the archeld top of the- bower. "Within was a mossy sent or couch, and on it plain prints, which told that two persons had been often seated there. -The devil of jealousy joined that of hate, and made me doubly a fiend in an'instant. I hid myself be- hind the arbor in a position where I could look through the branches into it, and then I took a pint bottle of brandy that I had in my pocket, and drank' verydrop of it at a breath! "Drink again, boys-drink to our hiding beauties in the woods, for my story is nearly to an end, and we must, go add hunt 'em up!" Again the half-maddened men drained the fiery draught, and Syke went on. "I had been there but a little while when she hove in sight. Never had I seen her look so lovely. Her golden hair hung in curls about her white neck and shoulders-her low dress revealed'her voluptuous and swelling bosoms, and the very breezes seemed to twine around her pliant and perfect form. Her cheeks were red with the glow of exercise, her parted lips seemed to drink in the per- fume of the flowers, and her blue eyes to swim in a sea of love and tenderness. "She seated herself in the  bower, and seemed, as she looked back up)n the patli, to be expecting some one. She took a miniature from her bosom and kissed it. I recognised it to be that of my brother. "Hell raged in my bosom at the sight. could restrain myself no longer! I sprung from my concealment and entered the arbor. The liquor was working, even as this rum now fires our blood, and fits us for deviltry. She rechgnised me through my disguise, and shrieked wildlyfor help. Oh, what music was her sacreams to my ears!   "' Scream on,' I cried. 'I have come to keep my oath.'           . "And I clasped her to my arms. 'You can guess the rest-no, not .all of it; for she never rose again. - looked upon her as she lay dis- honored-all that I had ever threatened. But blood and loam was oozing from her mouth- her face, wlerc th, blood did not stain it, was white as snow-t-er blue eye glare cold upon me, but it was glazed in death forever. "I heard a noise. I looked up, and saw my brother approaching., I rushed out to meet him. "' Go and see your love-she waits you in the arbor," I cried; and then I fled with the speed of a hunted stag before the hounds, nor did I stop till I was miles away, and elad in a new disguise. I knew that the hue and cry would be raised, and the country made too hot to' hold me.     t "I have never been there since. I got off to sea, went to France and Spain, fought under every flag nearly that is known, and'for every nation; and now I will fight against every flag that floats, "Was it not a brave revenge, boys--eh?" The men, used as they were to horrible scenes-hardened in many a crime--could not, at the moment, reply. His revolting tale seemed to shook even them! He saw this, and again plied the passing cup and then, while their veins seemed to fill with fresh fire, and their hearts-if hearts they had-to grow more reckless and desperate, he shouted: N"Now for tihe woods, to hunt our beauties out. The golden-haired one is mine, remem- ber." With loud yells, the desperadoes listened to his words and prepared to follow him, CHAPTER XXXVI. When, after seeing the murder of the officer, the poor girls fled in fear and horror from the spot. they plunged into the thick and tangled brushwood, and went to the further end of the island. But it was so small,:that they could hear the shouts and yells of the drunken crew, though they were spared the revolting recital made by 'the villain Sykes. "i What shall we do, if they seek us here?" moaned the terrified Lizzie, as they halted in a   small open space, where, as it was surrounded by a very dense undergrowth, Ruth hoped the y might be safe from search. "Defend our honor with our lives?" said the heroic Quakeress, drawing her dirk, and cast- ing down the scabbard, as well as her!'elt of useless pistols. Luliona said not a word, hut her glittering eye, her heaving bosom, and the firm grasp upon her bow, told that she knew their fears, and was ready to do and dare all that woman ever did or dared in ease like that! Her ears seemed so drink in every sound that came from the distant revellers. and after their last fierce shout, she bent her ear to the ground, and for some time seemed to listen. At last she rose, and said to Lizzie, as she refitted her arrow to the bow-string, and brought her quiver in front, where she could more quickly seize the arrows: "They come. Fear not, they come to death!" The shouts of the men, who were scattering through the woods in every direction, could now be plainly heard, and the two pale-faced girls trembled, and grew cold and white, for never-never, in all their dangers and suffer- ings--had peril seemed so dread and near. But, calm and composed, Luliona stood, a very study for a sculptor. Her finely modeled head was thrown back; her full bust seemed to swell as she threw her weight upon her left foot, and drew back the right; her bow was in her left hand, and the right arm developed its muscular beauty, as she half drew the keen arrow to a head. His were undying fame who could paint that scene-her fierce and expect- ant look, as she stood out before her more timid companions, who, though they held their bared dirks in their hands, seemed to have but little strength left with which to wield them. Nearer and nearer came the shouts; crashing forms were heard tearing through the bushes. Oaths, too coarse and blasphemous for me to repeat, fell upon their ears. At last a crash was heard close to them; then the huge form of Sykes was seen as he burst through the thicket, and entered the epace before them. ", Here they are, boys," he shouted. "Hur- t rah I Come on and seilx your game 1" An oath was on his lips, as his eye lighted   on Ruth, and he was about to bound upon her. But never swore he another oath. Luliona's arrow was drawn to its head as quick as thought, and the sharp twang of her bow was echoed by his death groan, for, through his fiendish eye, through his brain, sped jhe ar- row, and he sunk like a clod upon the earth. With an answering shout, two of his com- panions, who were very near, rushed forward. The first stumbled over his vile leader's corse, but an arrow pierced his heart before he fell- fell to rise no more. His companion, with a terrific yell, turned, and would have fled, but not quicker darts the red lightning from the cloud than did another arrow speed from Luliona's bow, and, with a dying shriek, he fell-its feathered shaft buried in his back, its point in the air, beyond his body. The three remaining wretches heard his cry, and thought it a signal to hasten them, and they came-came to death, for, as each appear- ed, that brave girl, who had ppoken no word, sent home her arrows into their black hearts, with a certainty of aim, and a deadly force, which none but a daughter of the forest could ever have achieved. Ruth and Lizzie could scarcely believe their senses I There lay, dead and cold, six stalwart, desperate .men and that slender girl, with scarce fifteen summers' suns of existence to look back upon, with a weapon as primitive as the history of antediluvial days, and almost as simple as David's sling, had done it all. Their lives and their honor now were safe. With tears of gratitude, 'they threw their arms around her neck, and kissed her a thou. sand times. But she evinced no extraordinary emotion- not one sign of regret, nor yet of extraordinary*  joy. "Food for the orowst" she said,' as ahe leaned upon her bow, and looked upon the stiffening bodies. "Would my sisters like their scalps?" "Oh, no-no, letus leave this horrid place, ' cried Lizzie "My heart sickens at the dread- ful sight!" *"Yes; let us go to the wreuk, and try to make a raft!" said Ruth. "It is horrible to think of staying here!" The girls, avoiding the ghastly bodies: now   hurried down to the sea-side, where the vessel had struck. And Ruth uttered a cry of joy as she saw a vessel in the distance, bearing away, for the channel, and so heeling that she must pass near the island. *' We will be saved," she cried; " none but an American vessel would enter at this end of -the Sound 1" And then she knelt, as did Lizzie and Luliona, and with. fervent gratitude she re- turned thanks unto God for His merciful pro- tection. * CHAPTER XXXVII. After leaving Norfolk, the Thunderbolt cruised away to the northward, But Seth's usual good luck did not attend him, and 'when he had got so far north as the latitude of New London, he was still without a prize, nor had he seen a single sail. When he sighted the headland of Montauk, and knew that the wind, as it then blew, would, long before nigft, waft him to the harbor of New London, where he ihoped to meet those whom he so dearly loved- he was almost tempted to forego his resolution not to go in without a prize. While he was thus cogitating, in the iresh breeze of the,morning, his first lieutenant, who, having lad the mid watch, had now just risenf Irom his berth, ap- proached him and said, in an unusually solemn tone; "I've had a dream-s* most aing'lar dream- Cap'n Seth!" ** Weft, let's hear it, 'Lijah, but have you had your bitters yet?" "Never mind the bitters, Cap'n Seth-never mind them just yet. I want to get this dream off my mind"!" "x Well, heave ahead, my hearty 1" Elijah stowed away a good load of tobacco in his starboard cheek, and did heave ahead. "After I turned in," said he, "I went to sleep as quick as a suckin' baby that's jist had its fill o' supper. And then I got to dreamin'--I thought I saw your sister Ruth, and them t'other ones, the Hale gal and the Ingine, and they was just in the nastiest scrape you ever hearn tell on, and a hull lot of fellers all around 'em, insultin' on 'em, and they a sereamin' and a cryin'. all 'cept the Ingine gal, and she a fightin' like mad, tooth and nail I Wall, i couldn't stand that no how, so I went   in to win. And jist as I did so, a ragin' lion come a jumpin', open-mouthed, right at me I I -gin ajump back, and somethin' hit me a whop- per on the head. and then-I woke up I "There I was, all in a lather of sweat, and a lump on top of my knowledge box as big as a geuses' egg, where I'd bumped my head up against the carlines while I was a pitchin' and a roarin' to help the gals! Now warn't' that an odd dream?"' "Very singular!" said Seth, thoughtfully. It struck him the more because he knew that Elijah did nriot wish to go inth port, and that his dreams generally came when he wish- ed to get him off on a cruise, or to alter his course for a latitude where the mate thought it likely a"prize could be made. "There's somethin' in this dream, Cap'n Seth 11" ontinued Elijah. "There's a sign in it, but what it is I can't exactly diskiver; but one thing is sartin', them gals is in -some trouble 1" / "I've half a mind to run into port and see if they have arrived safely," said Seth. *4 If-you had a hull mind, I wouldn't say no- thin' agin' itl" said Elijah. "That dream kind o' sticks in my craw." "Stand by to, round in the braces, rise tacks and sheets, and set studdiu' sails below and aloft," shouted Seth to his crew. "Keep her away west by south," he added to the helms. man. '"Square the yards and make sail; be lively, lads, we'll change the blue for the green water for a few days.* I reckon the British have left some turkeys and chickens in New London yet 1" The announcement was received with three , cheers by the men, and soon the clipper was covered with canvas from her deck up to her very truck, and glidingthrough the water like a dolphin in chase of it school of flying-fish. Speaking of flying fish, reminds me of an anecdote that I heard once about an aniiquat. ed but wealthy virgin known in her neighbor. hood, down east, among the women gossips, as Mris  Strickland; but generally known among the young folks as  "Old Sall Strchk- land"' She was rich andpious, aross enough to soar sweet milk if she only l1oked into it; and a Off soundings the color of the oeeaf is deep .blu#-on sorriding it i of a palish glrea.    great sticker up of truth no matter whether it carried with it ruin or offence, as the sequel of this episode will show. An idea of her can be better gained by prefixing a fact before the anoecAote which I promised to relate She was very hysterical, and whenever a fit of that kind came upon her, she thought that she was going to die right off So often had Dr. Brown, the village physician, been called up at the most unseasonable hours, without canase or reason, to attend upon her, that his patience entirely gave out. One night in winter, when it was bleak and stormy, he was aroused from his warm bed in hot haste'to attend the old maid again. She was " surely dying this time 1" said the mes- senger. "' I hope so," muttered the shivering doctor, as he went out into the wintry blast; ," if she ian't, I'll either kill or cure her!" When he arrived at her bed-side, he found her groaning and carrying on as if she had a neuralgic jumping tooth ache, combined with a touch of pleurisy and rheumatism. Seeing 'him, she cried: "You're just in time to see me go, doctor- I'm dying, I know I'm dying, and s'pose you don't care if I am!" ' Yes, I believe you are dying!" said he. "In fact I knew it before I came, it was re- yealed to me in a vision 1" "A vision ; one o' them thing's Dan'l had?"' She was a great Bible reader, and believed in nothing but what she could find there -Yet, a vision, such as you have read of!" he replied. ** Ohi tell me what it was, doctor!" said she, forgetting, in her curiosity, that she was "dying," and suddenly ceasing to groan. * I dreamed that I was dead," said the doc- tor, " and through some mistake I got the wrong ticket, and went down to hell instead of up to heaven!" "No mistake there, I guess," said Miss Strickland ; " you drink rum and Chaw tobac- ey, and swear, and hell's your portion ;' * I got there," continued the doctor, not heeding the interruption, ', and found the big he devil there, and a whole crowd of little devils around him. kickingup an awful racket, which leemed to drive him almost crazy. I ha bd just got there when be fairly boiled over. : i   "' Stop, you infernal noisy litt. e devils, STor for a litt)e while, wiU you?' he shouted. ' Stop and give me a little rest; Sal Strickland is dying up above. anO she'll be here directly, and then hell WILL be in an uproar.'  Just about then there was seen about five feet ten of skin and bone, wrapped in white, leaping from bed-the apparition of a doctor on a full run, with a broom flying after him, and a cracked voice was heard shouting : "I'm dead and gone to hell, am I? It's a lie, and I won't die to please you or any body else!" It is needless to say that Miss Strickland's hysterics were cured, and that she never again sent for Doctor Brown. But now, if you know her well enough, I'll come to the flying-fish story which cost her in- tended heir his inheritance. She had a nephew who had went to sea early in life, and who was the only rela- tive whom she had living. He came home from a voyage one time, and as- he always eschewed instead of chewing tobacco in her presence, and took orris root so that she couenl not smell grog in his breath, and told a great. many more marvellous stories, which she -ar very fond of hearing, he was of conree a tanv r- ite, and always spoken of and to as her futuroe heir. But his cake was turned into dough at last, and in this way. Young Strickland was telling her about a voyage he had made in the Red Sea. "And what d'ye think, Aunt Sally," said he, "one day, when we were hoisting our. anchor, we dragged up one of Pharaoh's chariots 1" "Likely," said she, "I've read all 'bout Pharo' and the Red Sea in the Bible!" "And," continued the yonth. "I wntr to see Lot's wife where she was turnedi inro a pillar of salt. There shle tod, julsti r at luiiralI as life, not even a ribbou of her hotnJet loriLo off 1" "Do tell!" said Aunt Sally, for shte h,1-1 read of that, too. , And they showed us the skeletou of J.-; nah's whale, too 1" added the hopeful. "It  must hev  bin a monstrous  big one 1" said Aunt Sally, with open mouth aud eyes. "Big as   meeting-house," replied  the   nephew. "Jonah had plenty of room for ex- ercise, there " "When we was crossin' the Gulf a comin' home." continued the nephew, "the flying fish came aboard so thick, that we had to turn all hands up with shovels to pitch 'em out of the way!" "John-John, you know I detest story- telling!" cried Aunt Sally, and the tip of her sharp nose began to shine, a, sure sign that a squall was coming.     l "But I'm not lying, Aunt Sally, flying fish are as common in the Gulf as birds are in the woods!" "Oh, John--John--I've read every word in the Bible; all about leviathings, and whales, and behemoths, and all that, but you can't show me varse nor chapter that tells about flying-fish 1" "I don't care,.I've seen and eat 'em, wings and all!" said the youth, getting "riled" at her contradictions, the more especially that he was telling a fact, and forgetting his prudence. "John, John, what a lie!" "I'm cursed if I'm lying!" shouted John, angrily. "It's the only truth I've told you, you miserable old mummy-faced catamaran i" It is to be supposed that Doctor Brown tra- veled fast before Aunt Sally's broomstick, after he had revealed his vision, but his speed would blush on the record when compared with that of John about that time, as first her s pectacles, then the Bible, and then a bowl of her favorite beverage, cold tea, went flying at his head. He never was allowed to approach- her again. She altered her will, and appropriated all her money to an asylum for the home of old unmarried ladies who had no lying ne- phews. And now that I've told my story about the "flying-fish," I'll wing my way back again to the Thufderbolt. Under her full press aof canvas, with the swell of the sea behind her, and the flood-tide in her favor, the graceful brigantine rapidly shot in between Montauk and Block Island and headed over for the mouth of the Thames. Seth had gone below to put on other clothes and fix up  as became the Captaip of a clip- per-privateer. when Elijah came to the cabhin with a spy-glase in his hand, and said:   "Capt. Seth, can't you come on deck for a minute t" "Why, wiat's up, 'Lijah? Nothing adrift, there?"P "I don't know;" said Elijah, ,"but down here on our lee bow, on one o' the little Gull's there's something that-looks like a wreck, and in shore of it, among the bushes, there's something like a flutterin' of petticoats, as if there was women folks there ' - "Keep the brig off, and head for the island. I'll be on deck in a moment. Have all ready for shortening sail " cried Seth, hurrying with his toilet. When Seth went on deck, he took the glass and went forward to examine that which had- attracted the attention of Elijah. Scarcely had he raised the glass to his eye, when he shouted: "Take in the studding sails I Clear away a boat for lowering. Set our colors forward." "What d'ye see, Capt. Seth?" asked Elijah, while the men were obeying these hurried or- ders. A"It is a wreck on shore, and I see women making signals to us; but no men in sight. It is singular," replied Seth. "Perhaps the men have gone for help," said Elijah. By the time that the lighter sails were taken: in, and the boat made ready for lowering, the brig was as near to the island as Seth thought it prudent  to go. Therefore,- he had the helm put a lee, the yards braced up, and the fore-trpsail -thrown aback to deaden her way. As soon as tt e vessel Was stationary, Seth had the boat lowered and manned, and telling Elijah that he might come along, he sprung into it and shoved off. In a few  moments he reached the shore, and as much to his astonishment as his joy, he was clasped in the- arms of his dear and 'long tried sister. Her story was soon told, and the bodies of the miscreants exhibited to testify to the match. less bravery of Luliona. Elijahl looked on and listened in silent Mon- der, and finally ejaculated: "Capt. Seth, ,don't you never, in all your Dateral life, larf at my dreams agin. Hasn't this one come true?"   "It has, indeed, Lijah" said Seth. "Your vision was wonderfully accurate, but where's the lion? Hadn't we better hunt him up?" Elijah didn't answer, but be filled his cheek with tobacco, and putting his hands in his pockets, contemplated the view seaward. Giving orders to some of his men to remain until he sent them tools to bury the English officer decently--the others he swore should rest above ground--Seth took the girls on board his brig, where they were soon made comfortable and refreshed in her elegant cabin. Here he told Ruth and Lizzie of the bravery of Saul, Simeon, and Chester. while the latter could hardly contain himself with the joy which he felt at finding Ruth, his own dear Ruth, after so many perils, ones more where he could protect her. Little did be dream when his Captain went ashore to the wreck, that upon that barren island stood all of the "I real estate" on which he had built his young affections. Luliona was not "a disinterested indivi- dual" either, for when Lizzie told her of Saul's being once more in safety, she said, in some of her newly acquired English: "a8ul I He great brave. Kill en'my heap. Me like him, heap l" Very expressive, if not very elegant-like her recent actions-very brief, but very cm- kat ic CHAPTER XXXVIII. I like not to look upon a death-bed-to watch the slow rising of Death's icy tide-the reaeding before it of Life's crimson flow. I ean bear, and have borne, without a shudder or a tear, the loss of dear friends upon the bat- tle-field, for glory seemed to shed a halo round their heads, and their country's flag to throw Aflushupon their stiffering features. Oh, may I be spared the long suffering of the invalid; the pity of the nurse; the merciless mercy of those who prolong, but cannot save, life-the tear of friends and relatives. Rather let me lie down upon the red battle-field, where men struggle for the righ/, and leap, sword in hand, with a smiling face, from this world to that 'Wher the wOU mX are ai rt." Ther was a *tod and mournful group gath-   ered around the bed of a dying woman, in a little cottage of rude construction, which had been erected in New London, on the spot where once had stood a tappy home-a home given to the flames by the recreant Arnold. Tha Widow Hale, and other sympathizing neighbors were there, and the deep gloom which clouded their faces, told how deeply their Pymnpathies were affected. It. was Mrs. Sabberday over whom they mourned-the mother of Ruth, whose spirit, tried with long suffering, was hovering almost on the verge of another world. Her sorrow, the fatigues and privations of travel, and constant anxiety, had been more than her age and constitution could support. She sunk under it, and now, in spite of medical aid and tender nursing, she was be- yond the hope of recovery. Yet, with Chris- tian fortitude and patience, she bore her pain, expressing but two wishes-that she might see all her children before she died, and hear that war had ceased,and peace reigned with- in the borders of her native land. But all this was not to be. Suddenly, while her gasping breath seemed to grow more and more faint-while her eyes seemed to grow more and more dim, and the suppressed breathings of her friends seemed to say that they felt that the dread hour of dis- solution was near-while the aged minister, him with white looks, and care-worn face, and feeble frame, worn out in the service of his Master, waa kneeling in prayer, the heavy boom of cannonry in the harbor was heard. And glad shouts-not cries of terror,.as when Arnold and his murderous band were there- fell upon the ears of the dying woman. Her eye brightened-color came back upon her pale and wasted cheek, like the last glance of the setting sun upon a snow-bank. She rose up in her bed, and her soul seemed to rally for a last stand against theienemy, which would rend it from its fortress ere it was ready to surrender to that conqueror against whom no mortal. can contend aid hope to be victorious. Gun after gun, with the rapidity of a regu- lar salute of compliment, sent its echoes through the air, and then up from hundreds of lips was heard the ery-- "The TAhunderbot I  The TuWxmtDr Oi t" "I thank THSS, oh GOD, thmato  hasthSard   mi prayer, and answered -it, in part P' mur- mured the widow, while, with clasped hands and brightened countenance, she waited to see, as she supposed, only her eldest born; for she knew not of Ruth's rescue. The sound of hurried footsteps, and a hum of many voices, came to the listener's ear. 'He comes-Seth comes!" she whispered, and her eager eyes were turned toward the door throughwhich he would enter. A moment of breathless suspense, and then a light form, followed by. others still, rushed into that darkened room, and warm arms were clasped around her wasted form, hot tears rained down upon her neck, and burning kiss- es were pressed upon her white, cold brow, while Ruth cried--. ' Mother-mother, I am saved-- saved, but must I lose thee?" "Give me air, give me lightr-cast wide open the windows, and led God's sunlight in, that I may look my last upon' my chtuld " said the dying woman, with an energy which, to all' but the experienced physician, gave hope that she would yet survive the shock. They did as she wished. The warm sun threw its yellow light in upon that excited group. "t Ah-Seth, Lizzie, Chester-all here!" she murmured, and to each she extended a hand, and a smile of ineffable happiness, settled like a ray of glory on her face. From one to the other her eyes wandered, and her lips moved as if she was praying heaven to bless them. Until now, Luliona had been left in the back- ground, but now Ruth and Lizeie led her for- ward, And placed her hand in that of the widow, and told her how the brave .girl had saved,' and guided, an#-g+arded themn through perils, many and fearfi. Heavefn bless her, and be ye even unto her as sisters are!" said the dying woman. "We will-we will l" was their response, and then Lizzie told Luleona who the sufferer was, and what she had said. The Indian girl bent her head, and kissed the pale and wasted hand which she held, and from her eyes grateful tears fell upon that hand. The energy of the invalid again seemed to die away, but, rousing herself for a last effort, she beckoned Chester and Ruth to approach.   Taking Chester's hand, she joined it with the hand of Ruth, and said, in a firm voice- "Chester, take my child, for. I am going from her now-take her, and may God deal with thee, even as thou dost deal with herl" "Amen!" said Chester, in a 'deep tone, full of emotion, but solemn as was her charge. *' Tell Saul-and Simeon, to acling to tseir country and Washington," she murmured. But her voice grew more faint, her respira- tio   more difficult. She beckoned Lizzie'to her. \  "Bless thee, my daughter!" she whispered, "Simeon will be home soon, but I shall not see him!" A gentle pressure of her hand, a soft sigh, like that of an infant sinking to slumber on its mother's bosom, and her unseen spirit left its earthly tenement, guided by invisible 'aSgels to the realms of bliss, " eternal in the heavens!" There was npo loud wailing ttere, though many a glittering -tear coursed in silelce down the cheeks of those who' felt that dvaath had come and gone, and taken one from among them, yet that the death-bed of the christian and the patriot was not a terrible place. CHAPTER XXXIX. The noon of the second day arrived. And outr-from that lone cottage was borne the cof- fin with the ebon pall above-it, and I elhind it cauie a sad but quet band of mournerm, as sin- cere as ever followed:loved one to the torlmb. And the proud banner that so oft had waved amid the battle's sulphurous srnoke and fltut- tered al. defiant in the gale, now drooped low beneath the peak of the anchore-d brlgatntme.. And her guns, which had thundered forth a thousands knells of death upon the BseA, where men went down, --"  Uncoffined anli uakncown," now gave forth ijdeep anda olenu minute tones, the signal that a loved atld honored one was moving on toward earth's last still restW nug-place.

In a moment he was * there. It was Simeon Sabberday. He threw himself from his horse, and advancing to Seth, as he looked and saw Ruth and Lizzie, and all WAd in the habliments of mourning, said: "Seth--our mother?9' "I tthre!" was Seth's sad reply, as he pointed to the new-made mound. ' Oh, that she had lived to hear the news I bring," he moaned. "What news?" asked Seth. "That proud England yields at last to ne- eetsity, and has ordered a cessation of hostili- . ties, and that even now the terms ofan honor- able peace, recognizing us as a free and inae. pendent nation are being made. The war is virtually at a close  The enemy have retired d from  all their posts in the south, and only t hold New York until arrangements for their 1 embareation can be made." "Now. God be praised, and may Washing.  ton be remembered forever by the grateful country which he .has so often saved when all msemed overwhelmed." said Seth, as he reve- rently raised his hat.          b The crowd   uncovered, and a low and deep A "Amen"  went from lip to lip, from ear to ear, s and we may hope 'twas heard in heaven, and to by the recording angel registered.    M "And where is Sault? asked Seth, when the brothers stood again within the lonely w mansion.                 I "He remains with Washington only till the in fal news of peace is brought; then will he hasten hither," replied Simeon. " A wonder- co fil change has bees wrought within that boy.

Weeks passed, and the gloom which had hung so heavy over the house of mourning, bad in a measure softened. Chester Parsons had spoken oft and again of his love, and so had Simeon, and had pressed those to whom they were bethrothed, to set a day which would solemnly seal that betrothal by the matrimonial Yow. And after consultation, they had named the day when Washington should declare his coun- try free, and peace restored, when he should lay down the sword, and say to his faithful followers that they were needed in the field no more. It was an autumnal morn. On withering grass, on sere and yellow leaf, on quivering branch the hoar frost lay thick and white. And the Btill cold air gave clear echo to every sound that rose upon its unseen wings. Ches. ter Parsons, Ruth, Luliona, and Seth, were seated at the breakfast table. Suddenly a distant sound was heard, and with eyes flashing, and joy in her f"ae, the Indian girl sprung from the table, and cried, in her newly learned English: "'Tis the great brave    Your brother comes!" Louder swelled the sound-'twas indeed the old Trumpet of Zion that they heard-then name the clatter of eteel-shod. hoofs, and shouts were bheard as they rung along the   streets, for afevery leap of his foaming steed the wild rider waved his Continental hat, and shouted : "Peace I Peace Pea  The war is over." Soon Saul reined in his steed a the door, and sprung to where his brothers'and his sis- ters stood, extending their arms to meet him. He did not look for his mother, for he had long since learned by letter of her death. But when he entered the house there was one whom  he did look for, aye; most earnestly; but it was not until he asked for "Luly " that the Indian maiden came forth, not boldly and' with flashing eyes and towering form as she bad stood in peril's hour, but with down-cast eyes, and throbbing heart and cheek, which  flushed and paled, and paled and fliushed, with emotions new and indescribable. "Is not Luly glad to see me?" he' asked, while an expression of sadness gathered io his countenance. "Oh, so glad," she said, and bounding for- ward she seized his hand and pressed it first! to her lips, and then upon her beating heart: Then she looked up timidly, trustingly, in ( his face, with an expression so meek, so full of  devotion, that no one could dream that she i could be one and the same who had stood so c fearlessly in front of her perilled friends, and a tent swift-winged death to those who would have wronged them-that she could he the  14 wild untutored child of Emathla, the/dread 9 chief of the warlike Seminoles. f. For a   moment thus she gazed-her bosom e. fluttering-her form all in a quiver-then she tl fled away like a  frightened fawn, perhaps to rt weep in her jovy, for by Saul's fond look, by tl the Gentle pressure of his hand, she felt-she hi kntM- -that he loved her.         in CHAPTER  XL.        tl Until the last white-haired veteran of the pr Revolution is laid beneath, the soil, for which so he fought and bled, the memory of that veteran ml will revert to the 4th day of December, 1783. te] On the noon of that day, George Washington, whom  no li-.e or rank could make greater et than he was, stood among the officers who had Ru elung -to him in deep and true devotion an through more than eight years of unceasing and thankless strife-bearing with him bard- fre 8Ed   eed ship, wrong, neglect, calumny, and injustice.- nd  stood among them to say a. few parting *ords and to. bid them and a soldier's life farewell. Quoting from Marshails brief but eloquent de. or, seription of. that scene, let me -revive its is- memory in American hearts, where it shofuld n. remain enshrined forever. The historian says: His'i emotions were too strong to be ooncealed llt Filling a glass, he turned to them and said: t  "e With a heart full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you. I most devoutly wish that your ; latter days may be as prosperous and happy, as at your former ones have been glorious and honora- d'  "Having drunk, he added-- I cannot come to ;e each of you to'take my leave, but shall be obliged if each of you will come and take me by the hand I' It   General nuok, being nearest. turned to him. bh ,Washiigron, incapable of utterance, grasped his b hand and embraced him. In the same affectionate mauner he took leave of each succeeding officer, The tear of sensibility was in every eye; and not a word was articulated to interrupt the dignifted rolence and the tenderness of the scene." Thus wrote the venerable Marshall, who had been the companion ot his glory and his suf- t ferings. This scene   concluded, Washington was about to proceed with his escort to the barge. f at Whitehall, which was waiting to convey him to Powle's Hook, but at this moment a captain of his Life Guard, advanced and craved - a  moment of His Excellency's time. "There are those, my General, who have long loved you and your cause, who crave your blessing, ere you depart, and when I say that three of them are women who have suffer- ed in that cause, and who arebetrothed to those who ever have been, and ever -will be ready to lay down their lives for you, I know that your excellency will spare the time to hless them, and smile your approval of their intended union t" Never had Washington looked more noble than when he smiled and took the arm of Simeon Sabberday; and went with him to a private parlor in Frances' hotel, where tim scene just described took place, and where. he met those in whom we have been so long in- terested, Saul Sabberday, looking every inch a  man, stood beside Emathla'e queenly daughter; Ruth was supported by the gallant Chester, and Simeon presented Lizzie to his chief. "Dear and valued friends, may the God of freedom and of love make you ever happy,"   ssi WsHeh;rgltlr,. nnd he presped each maily batid. sri kse d -eacn blushing cheek of those upon whom ba evoked thart benediction. Two other persons stood there, unprovided with consorts for the matrimonial sea. They were Seth Sabberday and Elijah Bunker. With gentle dignity the glorious Chief ad- vanced. and taking a hand of each he said: "Gentlemen. I have heard of you and your valued serviees For my country and for myself. accept my thanks." Seth was too full of emotion to speak, but. the tears of joy started in Elijah's eyes as he said, in a choked voice: "I never dreamed of TIS!" "Once mlre a kind farewell; God bless you Uall" said the noble General, and then he was gone. Reader, my tale is nearly told. A triple wed- ding made the memory of that day indelible upon the minds of each of the recipients of Washington's benediction; and it is to be hoped that the numerous and patriotic descen- dants of those happy ones will long cherish its memory. That those descendants, especially those of the Idiot Spy," have inherited the spirit and patriotism which was so strong a trait in the eharacter of Saul and his lovely bride, has since heen proved in two wars beneath their be- loved country's flag; and even now one who is as eloquent as he 'is devoted, holds a eom- manding position in the councils of the nation -far above the groveling herd who barter place and power for gold-to whom honor is unknown-honesty an obselete word- and whom it would be mockery to call pa- triots I And now to close. After the wedding fes- tivities were over, the party returned. to their village home. The crew of the Thunderbolt were paid off in round sums of prize money, but a few of them, among whom the chief was Elijah, begged Captain Seth not to " give up the ship;" and yielding to their solicitations, he disarmed her of her broadside guns, but he would not part with "Long Tom ;" and clearing her hold oher warlike munitions he fitted her up for te East India trade, in which he pros- pered long and well, setting up Chester and Simeon " his eonsignees in port, and thus   founding one of the heaviest and most stable mercantile firms in the country-one which laughed at panics, and sneered at speculations, while they pursued the even tenor of their way to wealth and honor. Of Captain Giles, one word; and then I've done. After waiting some days, the merce- nary wretch returned to the wreck of the Jerusha, to see what he could save. Fearing that some one might be by the wreck still, he landed on the opposite side of the island, and crawled through the bushes toward the spot where she had gone ashore. A part of his old crew were with him, and, being as cowardly as he was, they crept along at some distance behind him, for it was night, and though the moon shone bright o'er head, - the trees and bushes threw dark shadows in their tangled pathway. * Why don't you come along?   Who's afeard?" said Giles, in his usual whine. "What are you hanging back for? There's no ghosts or ghostesees here!" Scarcely a moment after, the crew heard him utter a terrible scream. Terrified, they hurried forward, and in the open space where the girls had sought refuge from the English desperadoes, they found Giles upon the ground, by the corpse of the villain Sykes, his hands clasped over his face, as if to shut out the horrid sight. They raised and spoke to him, but he made to answer. He was dead I Had the immortal CONNERY lived then, an "inquest" would have been held, undoubted- ly, and the verdict would have been-"Scared to death!" And if my readers had a word to say, I doubt not that they would have added, as an amendment- ' Sarved him right r" The men gazed for a few moments, in speechless horror, upon his body, and upon those of his slain men, who still lay as they fell. each with the feathered arrow remaining , in his death wound. Suddenly a rustling was heard in the bushes ; beyond-perhaps the wind or the wings of : some startled bird. But they waited not to learn what it was. With cries of terror they I fled back to their boat, leaving the body of I Giles to rot by the side of bolder but les   mercenary villains than himself, and never dd they dare approach that dreaded spot again.. Again, I say my task is done; and, though this story has been written on a bed of oick- ness, amid pain and. suffering, with a fevered brow and a nervous hand, I am more than re- wrded if I have awakened a few sparks of pa-   triotic fire in apathetic breasts; or, in weaving the woof of romance amid the warp of his- tory, made it more entertaining to the mind of my readers. I have striven to touch the chords of the harp too long laid by; have trodden a path which modern writers have avoided; it rests with you to judge of the value of my effort   151 LDW
