CHAPTER I.
"Mother, I am almost a warrior now ! I
am more fleet of foot than any runner in the
tribe ! My arrow never misses its mark, and
when Ohanwanho lets me shoot his rifle, my
aim is yet more sure than his ! I am strong ;
I will soon put my foot upon the war-path,
nd then I will prove I am brave ! Now,
hide from me no longer the place of my birth,
or the name of my father ! It is time that I
should know it !-time that I should know
why we loiter here, away from the tribe of
winch you say [ should be chief! There is
hot, strong blood in my veins-a big heart
-ats in my breast--I am an eagle, and must
not be chained, or I will .die, beating myself
to death with my own wings !"
These words were uttered by an Indian
youth, whose age might he fifteenor sixteen-
it were hard to determine it, at a glance, for
his form wasyet slender, though every muscle
was well developed, and it in its grace, height-
ened by his scanty but picturesque costume,
would have formed a study for the first sculp-
tor in the world. His features were noble,
his eye large and flashing, and his thin nos-
trils dilated, and his veins seemed to swell and
darken as he spoke.
She whom he addressed looked young to
be the mother of such a boy-yet the like-
ness of the two could not be mistaken. Tall,
elegantly formed, clad, indeed, like an Indian
queen, she was very, very beautiful. And a
gook of settled sorrow added to her dignity,
for there was pride rather than despondency
mn it !
They stood upon the banks of La Belle
Rliviere, the then silvery Ohio, for the dust
and stain of commerce had not then been cast
spon its limpid bosom, nor the rush of paddle-
wheels migled earth with water.
t    "Tn1AvrNoAmaaA !"
The mother laid her small hand upon the
impatient youth's shoulder, as she uttered

this word, and for a moment she looked him
full in the face, firmly but not unkindly. He
east his eyes down for a moment, and then
said:
"Mother, my ears are open to your words--
your eyes go through me, as the sun pierces
the water!"
"The first duty of a warrior is to learn pa.
tienee and fortitude 1" she said, slowly.
"Yes, mother! To bear hunger, thirst,
pain of body, all without a murmur or a
groan! These I am equal to,'but not, not to
this agony of mystery. To know that I am
something, and yet know not what-to feel
that I have a field of action open for me-for
me alone-yet know not where it is-to know
that you have some hidden sorrow in your
heart, and not know where to seek him who
placed it there ! Again I ask-where is my
father?"
"Buried on the banks of the dear, dear Mo-
hawk, where-where--"
The woman suddenly restrained herself, but
evidently with an effort.
" Where you must guide meI" continued
the'youth. "I will stand beside my father's
grave, and there learn my name-there take
counsel of his spirit, and learn what a war-
rior's son should do. Mother, we must go to
the Mohawk !"
" Thayendaneges, I dare net!"
"Mother, you are a squaw !"
No pen could describe, or pencil properly
delineate, the tone and attitude with which
those words were delivered. To call a war-
nor a squaw is the deadliest insult which can
be given; to remind a woman that she is a
squaw, is to bitterly reproach her for unwa.
manly weakness.

THAYENDANEGEA, THE SCOURGE ; OR.

The squaw who creeps upon women and
children when they are sleeping, deserves no
answer from the son of a warrior?" was the
bold reply.
In an instant, the tomahawk of the Mohawk
chief glittered in his hand, and the brave youth
would never have spoken again, had not help
been near.
"Hold on there-if ye'd not have an ounce
of lead in your old carcass !" cried a voice, as
the steel-bearing hand was raised, and at the
same moment Malcom, with six of Sir Wil-
ham's highlanders, appeared on the scene,
well armed and ready for action.
"Why does the pale-face interfere with my
business ?" asked the chief, haughtily.
"Because, in the first place, you were about
doing a most cowardly deed ;'in the next place,
you are interfering with peaceful travelers,
and, thirdly and lastly, as the preacher says,
because I choose to. So take yourself and
your painted gang away from here, or I'll give
you a better reason still for going !"
As he said this, Malcom touched the keen
hanger by his side, and motioned his men to
close up.
"These are my prisoners I" said the chief,
doggedly.
"Then come to Sir William Johnson for
them--lie sent me to bring them to him-let
that youngster go !" and he leveled his gun at
one of the warriors who held the youth.
The Indians started back, for they did not
like the muzzle of a cocked musket so close to
their breasts. The chief saw that lie was
overpowered, and sullenly called his men off.
"Tell the pale-faced chief that there is a
cloud between him and the chief of the Mo-
hawks !" said the bitter, fiercely, as he de-
icendfe the hill-side.
"Keloud of smoke and a quart of whiskey
will drive it out of'sight !" said Malcom, whose
opinion of the -Indian character was by no
means elevated.
He now told Dyagetto that she was safe,
and that Sir William, hearing of her coming,
bad sent him to look for and protect her.
Giving her and her children food from his
own well-stored haversack, after a brief delay,
be started at a rapid pace to recross the river,
sot liking to give the Mohawk chief too good
a chance to rally men and intercept him ; for
Malcom had "served'" on the other side of
the water, and knew that one of the best
qualities of a soldier is caution.
CHAPTER IV.
hir William Johnson was at dinner. On one
hand sat his nephew, Guy Johnson, afterward
his son-in-law; on the other, his son John,
both young men, full of life and adventure, and

as dissipated as young men of rank and means
think it necessary to be.
An Englishman would as soon think of
eating garlic soup as to sit at a table where
there was not a round of roast beef. This
dish was on the baronet's table, but there was
also salmon, trout, wild ducks, geese, turkeys,
partridges, quails, venison, etc., for he was
quite a fastidious gourmand, and beside, his
was an open table, and guests were entertained
every day. There were several on this occa-
sion, but none worthy of particular nota.
Lafferty, his secretary, sat vis-a-vis with Mr.
Flood ; his physician, Daly, an ancestor of Pat
Daly, sat a little further toward the head of
the ioard. Attentive servants were at hand
to supply every want.
The solid part of the repast was finished,
and only Sir William and his son and nephiew
remained over their wine, when Pontioch came
in, and, in a low tone, communicated some-
thing to his master.
"Let them be brought in at once !" said tha
latter. "I will see them here."
The servant withdrew, but soon returned
with Malcom and Dyagetto and.her children.
The mother had carefully arranged their
toilet, as well as her own, so that in their
native comeliness they showed but little of the
stain of travel.
A murmur of pleased wonder broke from
the lips of the younger Johnsons, as they
looked at the magnificent group, their eyes
wandering from the matured beauties of the
mother to those just blossoming in the daugh-
ter, and then to the erect and warrior-form of
young Thayendanegen, whom no presence
seemed to abash, and who seemed everywhere
to feel that he had no superior; that, indeed,
royal blood ran in his veins.
Dyagetto advanced with her children by he?'
side, until within a few feet of Sir William,
and then stopped, waiting to be spoken to. At
first she had looked him boldly in the eye,
but when his too ardent gaze seemed to scan
her form, she dropped her eyes, and the blood
rose to her cheeks and darkened their rich
transparency.
"So, Malcom, you found my friend !" said
the baronet.
"Just in time to save the top-knot of that
young man, Sir William.     Obeying your
orders, I kept trace of the old Mohawk, who
smelt them out before me, and when he
thought he had his game set, I stepped in and
drew the trumps out of his hand !"
"Apd took the 'honors,' my brave fellow.
I'll hear your entire report, by-and-bye, in my
library. I must check the insolence of that
rascal, even if I have to leave a vacancy in the
chieftainship of the tribe !"
"There should be no vacancy while the soa
of Ogahtee lives !" said-Dyagetto, in a tone of
calm dignity, but so low that only he heard it.
"Peace, wvman I" said Sir William, sternly.

though h~e started, and turned pale when she
uttered the name. "IIe must not be spoken
of, at least for the present!"
"Yet he speaks to e from his bloody
grave, and bids me demand justice for his
son-for my boy l" said the woman, boldly,
and her dark eye flashed, and her form seemed
to swell to a prouder height when she spoke.
"Enough, Dyagetto; no more, until I see
you alone !" saia he, speaking to her in her
own tongue.                          -
She bowed her head and was silent.
"What a noble-looking boy; he seems born
for a warrior !" said Guy Johnson, as he look-
ed at Thayendanegea.
"But how very beautiful is his sister !"
said John Johnsoa, whose admiring eye was
fixed upon her.
And she, too, was gazing upon him, but it
was in wonder, for he was dressed very richly,
withal was handsome, and she never before
had seen a being beside her brother, who
looked so noble as he did. She did not con-
strue his ardent gaze in the manner which one
who knew of the world and its ways would ;
therefore her eyes were not east down, nor did
a blush rise to express emotions of anger or of
mortification.
But Dyagetto saw the look, divined his
thoughts, and quickly said:
" We will retire, my children ; when Sir
William wishes to see me, he can send for me !"
"See to their comfort, Malcom," said the
baronet; "have rooms assigned them, and tell
the steward to see that they are refreshed.
And keep a guard about, not upon them, but
for them! The old Mohawk chief is crafty
and dangerous !"
The soldier's salute was his only reply, as
he turned upon his heel and left the room,
followed by the Indian woman and her chil-
dren.
"That boy steps as proudly as a king,"
said Guy, as Thayendanegea strode away.
"There is kingly blood in his veins !" said
Sir William, but he did not speak of them
again during the course of the meal-
CHAPTER V.
Foiled in his intentions against Dyagetto
and her children, by the opportune arrival
and action of Malcom, the old Mohawk chief
sullenly returned to his village. It was on
the banks of the rushing stream which bore
the name of his tribe, nestled in amid gentle
slopes which were covered with corn, melons,
etc., and few, to look upon the neat houses, the
tasteful enclosures, the well-laden fruit trees,
would have deemed that none but savages
dwelled there. This proved that the red man
could imitate the pate-face in the procurement
of comforts-alas, that he can so readily also

imitate the vices of the white man; for, physi
ally, he is far the noblest of the two.
When lie arrived, lie dismissed the warriors,
who had been with him, with a caution to be
silent about the occurrences of the morning,
and then sent for his son, a warrior almost in
age, if not in action, for he was at least five
years the senior of Thayendanegea. Ie was
tall and powerful in appearance, yet there was
no true nobility in his appearance, for the ex-
pression of his countenance told of a low and
crafty nature, of a disposition lacking open
courage, manliness, and generosity. His dress
redolent of ornament, and his face without a
sear, and ornamented weapons without marks
of use, told as much of his character as I could
describe in half a chapter.  '
" Ipisico," said the old chief, as his son en-
tered his lodge, from which he had sent out
the women previously, " when the Great
Spirit takes me up to the happy hunting-
grounds, who will be a chief in my stead? who
be the head man of the Mohawks ?"
"Why doe    my father ask?" replied the
young Indian.' "Who but Ipisico will then
be chief?"
"Another may claim the place ?"
"But he will have no right. I am thy son!"
"Yet another livis who will claim that his
right is better than that of Ipisico !"
" Tihe Mohawks will not listen to him I"
" If his story, truly told, goes to the Mo-
hawks' ears, they will know him as chief, and
bid Ipisico hide his head S"
"Who is lie? He must die !"
' a isico now speaks like a warrior ! Let
him act as. such! Yes, the boy who would
fill the place of Ipisieo, must die, and Ipisico
must slay him !"
"Yes, where does he sleep!" said Ipisico,
eagerly.
"Would you fear to slay him, were he
awake and standing before you ?' asked the
old chief, with a touch of-sarcasm in his tone
"Oh, no I Ipisico knows no fear !" said the
young Indian, and even as he spoke, he glanced
quickly around, as if he feared some one would
hear his boast. "'Where is this pretende?"
" In the castle of the great pale face, pro.
tested under his wing !" replied the old chief
"Who is lie ?"
" The son of Ogahtee, whose place I fill!"
'"My father dreams. Ogahtee's son died
with his father-so all the tribe know !"
"Not so-a woman's prayer saved his life
He is the tree across thy path!"
"'Which I will cut away 1" said Ipisico. In
a bitter tone, for he had too long and im-
patiently looked for the day when lie should
be chief, to be willing to lose it without a
struggle, coward even 'though he was by
nature.
"Yes, it must be done, and by thy hand
But not yet-it must be a work of time and
care. Yesterday, I quarreled with tle great

Ch APTER VI.
After hA had dined, and learned that the ne-
essities of )yangetto and her family had been
proe.rly ctterndeh to, Sir Wilhiam sent for rer
to come to his library, for ie wished to con-
verse wtht her alone. But a few moments

"Not even' lie, the mu rdcerer of'rmy Ihusbanld
and the usurper of his place, whom, even you,
have protected-vou who have fed in my
husband's wignam, and slept while he watched
over you ! You asked me why I came back
from the Mirnamis ? It was to look once more
upon the grave of my husband, to see tlr
pths which I trod in my childhood-to drinl
of the cool waters of my birth-place ! Te
bring my children here, where you ungiht set
them. and when I laid down beside my Ogah
tee, as soon I shall, that you might'be just
and protect them who were without father o
mother !"
fir William seemed strangely affected winle
the noble Indian woman spoke in a tone ofim.-
passionled earnestness. After some moment.
of agitation, he spoke:
" Dyagetto, you have been deeply wronged--
I have been a party to much of your wrong ;
but policy and circumstances drove me to
much which I would recall, were it possible.
But you have come to me for justice and pro.
tection. The last you shall have, and the first,
so far as it is in may power to render!"
'Shall Thayendanegea fill the place of
his father, ani shall the scalp of that father's
murderer dangle from his lodge-pole ?" asked
the woman, eagerly, asking, mother-like, all
for her son, and nothing for herself.
"In time he shall know that he is chief of
the Mohawks, and the tribe shall know it, and
then, if he becomes the warrior which his looks
now promise-"
lie has the soul of Ogalitee-his heart is
big, and lie is brave !" said the proud mother.
"' Then he shall have my aid to place him
where his brave father stood-ray aid to
avenge Ogahtee's death !"
The haughty pride of the Indian woman
melted in a moment, and tears sparkled in her
great black eyes, while she threw herself upon
her knees before the baronet, and pressed his
hands to her lips.
" Dyagetto thanks the great chief for his
promise !" she said, in broken accents, for she
was sobbing With joy.
Sir' William lifted her up, and bade her be
seated again.
"The time for this has not yet come !" he
continued, " nor must Thayendanegen yet
know who or what he is. I do not yet ab-
solve you from your promise of seeresy, for
Ie must be educated and prepared for his
position. I will confide in Dyagetto, for I
know that sine is good and wisO-she will n't
speak to other ears what I give to her's
alone !"
"A chain is upon Dyagetto's tongue when
the great chief wills it !" replied the woman.
"Then I will speak. The colonies, begin-
ning to feel their strength, are already almost
in open rebellion against our father, the king,
beyond the seas. A war is almost certain, a

li
Y

war in which they will strive; but strive in
vain, for independence. Many will be loyal,
and the king has many warriors whom he
will send over to crush the rebellion, and to
aid those who are loyal. I know that my red
brothers will fight for the king, for he is rich
and great, and will make them many presents ;
anldtie colonies are poor, and cannot do it.
And, in such a war, the chief of the Mohawks,
the first tribe of the Six Nations, will be a
reaut man ! It is my wish that Thayenda-
negea should learn well the language and the
arts of the white man, for a great path is be-
fore him, and I will put his feet upon it! Is
Dvuagetto willing that her children should re-
mamn i my family, and be treated as my own
are treated ?" l
le Indian woman looked him steadily in
the fies for some moments before she replied,
as if she would read the inmost thoughts of
his soul, and then sire said
"Dyagetto is willing--the words of the
great chief are good in her ears !"
"And Dyagetto, too, will make her home
beneath my roof."
" Dyagetto would live with her people, and
be free to go and come as she wills !" replied
the woman.
"'She shall have her wish," said Sir Wil-
liami. "And, now, let Dyagetto go and tell
Thayendanegea to come here, for I would
talk to him, and put hope and wisdom in his
heart."
The Indian woman bowed her head, and
left tire room.
"So far, so good !" said Sir William, when
Ie was alone. "I wish old Aroghyadecka
,    was out of the way. His son is not to be
feared, but rather to be despised. But the
old man is crafty, and has made himself popu-
lar with iris people. If Thayendanegea were
only a few years older, a blow might be struck
by his own hand, which, while it placed him
at the head of his tribe, would at once raise
him to the height of popularity with them."
Tire soliloquy of the baronet was inter-
rupted by the entrance of the young Indian
of whom he spoke.
Advancing proudly, with a step at once
bold and free, a figure erect as a pine deep-
rootel in its ratire soil, and an eye as bright
as that of the untamed eagle. Thayendanegea
was an object calculated to elicit admiration
from any one capable of appreciating manly
beauty in one so young.
"My mother bade me come to the great
-lnet'. I am here !" said the young warrior,
standing in an attitude of respect before the
baronet.
It is well, Thayendanegea," said  Sir
William. "I sent for you to say that, hence-
forward, you are to dw with me, and I will
be to you ars a father "
"A fatlhe-!"said the young Indian, quickly
-" father   Did you know my father ?"

7

"I did; and I hope yet b see his son like
him-a great Warrior."
Who was he ?" asked Thayenddnegea,
abruptly.
"When a pro per time comes, you shall
know ; but, till  en, ask no living being a
question about hni, nor breathe his name.
It is my command."
"I cannot speak his name, for it has been
hidden from me !" said the youth, sadly.
You shall know it, I repeat, at a proper
period," said the baronet. "In the meantime,
be patient and studious, and prepare to be
great in the council and on the war- path,
Remember that a great chief has adopted you
as a son."
"Thayendanegga will not forget," said the
young warrior.
At that instant, the door of Sir William's
room was' opened without a knock, or any
ceremony, and Aroghyadeeka and Ipisico en-
tered.
A frown gathered, like a thunder-cloud,
dark and ominous, upon the brow of the
Englishman, and bitter words were rising to
his lips; but, when he saw that the old Mo-
hawk chief wore a look of deep humility, in-
stead of his usual defiant expression, and bore
a present of very vahable furs, in token of a
wish to make peace--as did his son, also-he
restrained himself, and waited for an explana-
tion of the visit with his usual stoical com-
posure.
But the eyes of young Thayendanegea
almost flashed fire, as he recognized his captor
of that morning and the insulter of his mother,
and it needed a look and sign of caution from
Sir William to make him restrain himself.
The old Mohawk and his son advanced in
silence, and laid their presents at the feet of
Sir Williani, and then retired a few steps, with
their eyes down-east, and their looks expres-
sive of sorrow.
The baronet did not touch the presents,
but, with a stern look, regarding them for a
time in silence, and then said :
"Why is the chief of the Mohawks here
after his words of insult yesterday? Does he
think that I am a woman, whose memory of
wrong can be hushed by a word, or driven
away by a repentant look ?"
" Aroghryadeeka was a fool! He has eaten
his words. His heart is heavy, for he was
wrong. The anger of the great chief is like a
cloud upon his spirit, and he has brought him
presents to ask'him to lift off thi cloud, for it is
very dark in the path of Aroghyadecka ! Ho
has brought his only son, Ipisico, to the great
chief, to be a surety that he will do wrong no
more. Let the great chief put him in his
school, or make him hunt and fish for him

Sir William now filled a second glass of
brandy, and the reconciliation was complete,
so far as outward appearance indicated. The
Indian soon after took his leave, and then the
baronet sent for his steward, and gave particu-
lar directions regarding the disposition and
treatment of the recent accessions to his family.
He then bade him send Thayendanegea to
him-also Mr. O'Whackem, the schoolmaster.
CHAPTER VI.
The schoolmaster was the first to make
his appearance, perhaps because he scented
brandy, for the baronet never failed to pro-
duce that article when he was in a good
humor, and it is not in the creed of any true
Irishman to refuse a glass of good liquor. -
"I sent for you," said the baronet, when
Mr. O'Whaekem entered, "to instruct you
that you will have three new pupils in the
morning."
"Male or faymale, Sir William ?"
"Both-two young Indians-one, the son
of the Mohawk chief; the other, a boy whom
I have adopted, a regular eagle, who will be
apt to stick his talons into you if you are too
rough 'with him-so I deem it best to warn
you. His sister you will instruct with the
same care and gentleness which you'bestow
upon my own daughters!"
"Your directions shall be duly attinded to,
Sir William !" said the pedagogue, with a
backward scrape of his foot, and a forward
snap of his head, which would have endan-
gered a neck more slin than his.
"Take a glass of brandy-help yourself
from the table there !" said the baronet.
O'Whackemn dutifully obeyed the -order,
without the slightest hesitation. While he
was drinking it off, Thayendanegea entered.
"Why did the son of Dyagetto leave the
room so abruptly, with a cloud on his face, a
little time ago ?" asked the baronet.
"My heart was hot, for I saw an enemy
before me !" replied the boy.
" Thayendanegea must learn to curb his
passion in my presence I" said the baronet,
sternly,
"Will the mountain torrent stop when the
great chief tells it to do so? Will the eagle.
pause in its flight toward the sun when he
calls to it? Can he tell the clouds not to
rain, the winds to cease, and will they obey
him ?"t
"No! But Thayendanegea lb neither the
rushing stream nor the elanless winds !"
"The hot thoughts of his heart are more
free than they !"
"They must be curbed, and Thayendanegea
must learn patience, else he will not be the
great warrior which I would make of him1"

" Thayendanegea will try, but do not ask
him to touch hands with Iis enemy.' his
heart will not hold a lie I"
"I do not require that--but the son of
Dyagetto must make no quarrels in my house.
Ipisico will dwell here, and if you do not like
him, avoid him, but make no quarrel I"
"I care not for him-he is a squaw, and
dare not look me in the eye. But Iis father
spoke bitter words to my mother, and I will
kill him for it yet Y"
"Bide your time, boy, bide your time !"
said the old baronet, who could not help ad-
miring the truthful candor of the   outh.
"You can go now-to-morrow you will com-
mence to study."
Thayendanegea slightly bowed his head,
and turned away.
"What d~o you think of him, O'Whackem?"
asked Sir William, after Thayendanegea had
gone out.
"By my faith, sir, I belave there is a spice
of the divil in him. I nivir saw such an eye
in a human, before-it looks lane through
ye!"
"There is more intelligence expressed in
his face than in that of any Indian whom I
ever saw before. ; I wish his education care-
fully attended to !"
"It shall be dorA, Sir William. Is it the
classics ye'd have me induct him into as well
as the lower branches ?"
"No-the more useful branches ! Learn
him to read and write well, and be particular
in his mathematical knowledge,'for he will
be a great military leader yet, or my judg-
ment is in error !"
"And the other one, Sir William--what
shall I do with him ?"
"The best you can ; but keep a close eye
upon his movements and ways. He isa
snake and a spy, I expect-but let him have
no hint of my suspicions    Take another
lass, and leave me, I have letters to write
before the carrier leaves for Alban !"
"Health and long life to yer honor ! May
the day be far off which opens wid sorrow
for ye, Sir William!" said O'Whackem, as he
tossed off his second bumper, and then strode
out of the room.
"He is indeed a noble boy, and Dyagetto
only uttered truth when she said that Ogah-
tee's spirit seemed renewed in hum 1" solilo-
qui ed Sir William, when he was once more
alone. "He is destined to be a great Tian,

THAYENDANEGEA, THE SCOURGE, OR,

CHAPTER VIII.
The steward of Sir William introduced On-
alova to his two daughters, and caused the
housekeeper to prepare for her at apartment
near theirs. The Indian girl was not so much
of a curiosity to them, as they were to her,
for, born of a fair and flaxen-haired German
another, they were more white and more behu-
tiful in their style than anything she had ever
dreamed of before. Their dress, though plain,
was very rich to her eye, and far more beauti-
ful than that which she wore; but when Kath.
leen, the youngest, playfully dressed her in
one of her own gowns, and put stockings and
shoes upon her feet, poor Onalova felt as if
she was in chains. Ilcr own garb best suited
the free action of her lithe figure and sym-
metrical liu.bs. And we are fain to say that
no fashion in the world so becomes a faultless
figure as that of an Indian maiden. The
fringed jacket, fitting, but not compressing
the bust and waist; the full skirt descending
to or below the knee; the beaded moccasins,
the mantle of munny hued feathers, the flower-
wrought wreath, over black and flowing
tresses, all adorn beauty far more than hoops
and bustles, flounces and laces, ribbons and
gew-gaws.   This is'may opinion ladies of
fashion, get trad at it if yon like.
The daughters of Sir William, Kathleen
and Leonore, who had been brought up in
great seclusion, were very much delighted at
the thought of having a young companion
whom they were told to treat as kindly as if
she were their sister; and Onalova did not
feel sad or lonely when her mother told her
she was going to visit her tribe and relatives
for a few days, they were so very kind to
her.
All of the afternoon of the first day was
s ent by them in arranging and ornamenting
0nalova's room, according to their ideas of
comfort and taste.
Onalova looked on with astonishment and
wonder, for she was so all unused to luxury
and ornament, other than the flowers and
gems of nature, and the feathers, and furs, and
painted larks which her brother had given
her, that these things seemed to her more
beautiful than would the furniture of a palace
to a peasant girl, fresh from her homely cot.
And, unlike a warrior, or even her brother,
who was a warric.r in embryo, who would let
nothing force an utterance of astonishment
from their lips, her words of surprise and
pleasure were frequent and many. This de-,
lighted the other girls, who literally despoiled
their own rooms and wardrobes to furnish
hers. After all was dose, Kathleen cried :
a Now, Onalo a, dreas me in your style ; I
wish to see how I will look in your dress !"
"The Pale-Rose is very beautiful-I love
her !" said the Indian girl, as she hastened to
perform the desired toilet. "Will she be my
aster ?"

"Yes, and Leonore, also-we will both b
sisters to you. We will learn you to write,
and draw, and play the harpsichord, and you
shall learn us to bead moceasins, and work
porcupine quills on the white fawn-skins, and
make feather wreaths and capes."
Soon Kathleen, who was very beautiful in
face and form, was arrayed in the robes of
Onalova, and they added to rather than de-.
tracted from her natural loveliness. Her full
bust and well-turned limbs were revealed just
enough by the proportions of the dress to
show how exquisitely she was formed, and
her gold-hued ringlets fell down upon her
white neck and shoulders Rs bright as sun-
light upon snow. Leonore, who was ever
the most quiet or the saddest of the two, was
in ecstacies, and declared that she, too, must
have a dress like that of Onalova. But we
will leave them for an instant, for I wish to
keep an eye upon the hero of my story.
When Thayendanegea left the presence of
Sir William the second time, he was met in
the hall by John and GuV Johnson, the son
and nephew before alluded to. Both greeted
him with kindness, and the elder, John, said:
"You must be my brother, Thayendane
gea !
"And mine also !" added Guy.
The young Indian'regarded them both at.-
tentively for a few moments, then he extended
his hand to John, and looking coldly at Guy,
said :
" One brother is enough for me
Guy reddened with mortification, or anger,
perhaps with both ; but John good-naturedly
said :
"If he is my brother, Guy, he is your
cousin still !"
"Be a brother to him !" said Thayenda-
negea, pointing to Ipisico, who, dressed in alA
his tawdry finery, stood near them, but not
looking half so noble as Dyagetto's son, in his
plain garb
" I will, and you may regret the hint'"
muttered Guy, as he went and joined the son
of the old chief.
- Come and look at our horses !" said John
to Thayendanegea. "Do you love to ride ?"
he added, as he led the way to the stables.
"Yes! the wild horses from the plains, that
fly like the wind, arid shake the ground with
their mighty leaps ! Yes, such ones I love
to ride !"
"Then we've got one that will snit you,"
said the young man--" one that no one
dares to back. - He is so fierce and wild,
that the grooms fear to take him from tho
stable !"
"I will ride him!I" said Thayendaneges,
quietly,
"But I tell you he is ungovernable !"
" I will tame him 1"

"Mr father will let none of us mount, or
try to mount hiii! !'
""I w. . ride hint!" said the yonng Indian,
so fiercely, that his companion was for the
me'nct startled.
In a few moments they were at the stables,
where Sii William's magnificent stud of sad-
dIe and carriage horses were kept. There
vere imported hunters, heavy draught horses
from  Flandkrs, and  the stocky lint agile
ponies front Canadha. But the eves of the young
Inlian pissed these over with scarce a glance.
He looked for the tamneless steed which no
one dared to ride. And his dark eyes flashed
proudly lawhen he saw it-a black stallion,
without a spot of white, in form the perfec-
titn of syietry--deep-ehested, thin-faniiked,
with a saill head, a fiery eye, and great nos-
trits, which distended with anger at the ap-
proach of man, as if to speak his hate of those
who held him in bondage. His glossy mane
and tail swept nearly to the ground, and his
slender limhs revealed their sinewy strength
in mnc)le rathei- than in size. IIe was fasten-
ed to the strong posts at the head of the stall
by a halter of chain, for rope would not hold
hin.
"Bring me a bridle !" said Thayendanegen,
while be surveyed the miagniicent animal
with looks of the keenest admiration.
"You rannw! bridle him-all the men about
the stable could not do it!'
Where are your bridles ?" was the only
reply that Thayendanegea condescended to
make.
At the call of the young Englishman, a
groom a proached, vho, in obedience to his
order. brought a bridle; but w hen he was
toll that it. was the intention of the young
Indian to ride the black'stallion, Vesuvius, he
was imirror-strieken.
It is impossible to bridle him, letalone the
ridiiig of him !" said the man.
"You talk, I do !" said Thayendanegea,
snatching the bridle froni his hand, and a
heavy whip, which he carried.    He then
boldly entered the stall.
"(Gol ! the beast will kick his brains out,
or gnaw him up with his teeth !" cried the
gromo, as sonic of the other servants hurried
to the spot
But the young hero did not heed these re-
marks. 1k went boldly to the head of the
horse, which snorted with anger, and quiver-
ed in every limb, as if about to try and burst
fromtthsstrong chain which was strapped to
its glo ssy nbeck. But looking right into its
fiery eye, and laying his haiid learlessly n1
its mae, the brave mad stroked it gently:;
and when it reared up. and tried to plunge
son hn  wit hi its fore feet, lie scarcely
t'otvel, more than to avoid them, and as its
heal catme down, by an adroit movement
shi pled the hit in its mouth, and!. the bridle
upon its heal, tlhro*ing the reins back upon
the neck, ready for use.

THE WAR-EAGLE OF THE MOIIAWKS

The exclamations of the gi ooms, who wit-
nessed an act which none of them would hav.
the courage to perform, drew still more wit-
nesses to the extraordinary spectacle. but a
moment after all dispersed with a shout of
terror, and sought places of safety, when they
saw Thayendanegea. deliberately cast off the
chain from the neck of the dreaded animal
and lack him, rearing and plunging as he
was, from the stall into the open space o'-ts
side of the stable.
The moment that he was clear of the build,
ing, Thayendanegea leaped upon the back of
the fiery animal, which made one or tw
maddened bounds, and then stood for an in
stant foaming and gnashing its teeth and
trembling with fury before the front of the
mansion, upon the porch of which Sir William
and his family now stood, drawn out by the
cries of the men at the stable.
"Good heavens, the boy is mad ! Vesu-
viis will kill him.!" cried the  baronet, im
alarm for his new protege.
And by the wild plunges which the mad-
dened stallion now made--now leaping wits
all four feet from the ground-then rearing
and whirling in circles around-then lung.
ing forward and kicking its heels high in the
air, it would seem as if no rider could keep a
seat upon its back.
The daughters of Sir William screamed iD

Finding all its efforts to cast such a rider

"Will my sister give mie her brother for
mine ?" asked the Indian girl, artlessly.
"Oh, yes, you may have .John ; yes, indeed"
"'hen you may have Thayendanegea!"
repliel Onalova.
A bargain, and witnesses thereunto !" cried
a manly voice at the door, and John, who had
app roached noisekssiy, and heard the conver-
sation, now entered the room with Thayenda-
rie"e-.
Kaitlileen  uttered a faint 'scream --she
wouidnt have been in the fashion if she had
not; but Oialova looked as calm and contented
as if she felt that she had neither said or done
anything which was worth a scream era blush.
And, cont lasted with those pale-faced beau-
ties, sel seemed far the loveliest. Their su-
perior in et ture and in elegance of figure, her
comt plexion so transparent that each vein
could be traced beneath the skin, dark though it
was-her large black eyes meltingly soft--her
glossy hair of raven hue, as fine as silk--her
features classical aid perfect-her expression
at once proud, yet gentle and loving in its very
dignity, how could she be other than very,
very beautiful
And so t.htiught the heir to the title and
est ate of Sir William Johnson,.and wild and
impulsive as he had ever been i his nature,
and free from love, if not from passion, he now
knew a feeling which had newer entered his
heart before. le felt as'if lie loved that poor
Indian gihi better than all the world beside.
And his feelings, like those of all in their first
love, were pure ! No sensuality, no selfishness,
no hypocrisy were nixed with them.
le now introduced Thayeidandgea to Lis
sisters as his adopted brother, and after they
had given the young men seats, they did what
they could to amuse them. Leonore, who
drew and painted well, produced her portfolio
and exhhibted her drawings and sketches,
while Kat hileen brought out various eibroid-
cries, im which sie greatly excelled.
The dark eye of' whayendanegeawandered
carelessly-over all the drawins, which were
landscapes and sketches of birds and flowers,
until at last it came to a spirited battle scene,
eolpied by her from some old painting. Then
his eye flashed, and as it noted each figure of
man and horse, the living and the slain, lie
uttered the word:
"Good! .They fight!I"
Poor Kathleen felt not a little mortified
that lie did not speak a word of praise in re-
gard to her work, and she thought it strange
that the young Indian scarcely looked at her
or her sister, and then manifested no acknow-
ledgment "f their beauty-none of the wonder
which Onalova had felt and so freely uttered.
She was deternined to see if he had any feel-
ing, or really was tire stoic which he seemed ;
and thought, and justly too, that music would
he the surest test; for hard is the heart, and
steru the soul, which music will not melt.
She brought outlher harpsichord, andon-

meneing  within a low prelude, acconpanied
herself to a sweet song. Her voice was rich
rand full, and as she sung of love, and she
seemed to feel its power, it fairly filled the
room with melody. Ier bosou rose and fell,
and the color deepened on her cheek as she
sung ; but Thayendanegea remained as caln
and passive as a stone, looking more at the
mechanical action of her fingers upon the in-
struient than anything else.
Suddenly she changed the theme, and sung
an ancient var-song. As her voice rose in
this and thrilled out the charge and the bat-
tle's clangor, then the young Indian's eyes
flashed, and his broad chest heaved, and his
nostrils dilated, while his ear seemed to drink
in every note.
Good !" said he, when she, half exhausted,
closed the song.
She had touched the right chord of his na..
tore   No carpet knight was he to list to
pling strains of love, but every inch a war-
rror and a man, though time had not yet ap-
corded unto hum a warrior's place.
Delighted with even that success, Kathleen
only paused to recover breath, and then she
conmenced another song-a song once more
of love.
Suddenly the sound of a drum and fife near
the house was heard.
"What is that ?" asked Thayendanegea,
starting to his feet, and listening to the ma.
tial music, all forgetful that Kathleen was
singing.
"Malcom   is mustering the men for the
night-'uard !" said young Johnson.
"Let us go-I like that music-I want to
see them! Can they fight?"
"They did in the war with the French P'
"I must see them! I love to look at war-
riors ." said Thayendanegea, not appearing to
heed the presenrce of the girls in the slightest
degree.
Young Johnson would gladly have lingered
there longer, so as to have conversed with
Onalova, hut the impatience of her brother
could not be checked, and the two young
men went out to attend the parade of the
guard.
CIIAPTER  X.
Back into a grove in the rear of the man
sion strode Guy Johnson, after his discom-
fiture related at the close of the eighth chapter.
And as he went he bit his lips until the blood
ran from therm, and actually wept from anger
and msrtificatioh. And curses, bitter and deep,
and al too wild for utterance from ips so
young, burst forth as he passed on, until he
reached a mossy bank, beneath the shade'of ,
some tall pines, upon which he east himself.
Then ie heard light foot-steps behind
him, and knew for the first time that he was

followed. Looking back, he found that it was
{pisico.
"M v heart is sad for my brother, and
angry ~with his enemy !" said the youig In-
alan.
Whie is my enemy ?" asked Guy, angerly.
W 'V ho but this Tyencudanegen, who is also
cy enemy-who but he, that comes fro-i no
cne knws where, and is no one knows what?
Who but he '
"True, Ijisico, he is an unknown upstart ;
but I will humble his pride ! I'll take the
starch out of his ruffles ? et !" cried Guy.
" I will kill him for my brother-will watch
him close, and w hen he sleeps my knife shall
drink his blood!'
"  o-tlhat will not do here! My uncle
has taken a fancy to him, and were ias brood
gbed, he would find all out, and hang any one
"oneerned in the deed, even if it were me, his
own brothers son !"
* I will kill the horse which threw my
brother, then'! That will touch the heart of
our enemy, for it will spoil his triumph
" Yes, you nay do that I It will touch him
o the quick. ''he horse should have been
 mine at any rate-anl you may kill the snow-
white peomiy in the stable which belongs to mny
cousin Kathleem, for she, too, dared to taunt
une when I was thrown, I will be revenged
upon all of them. I care not what it costs !"
"My brother is a great brave ! And so am
r. I will help him to crush his enemies ! My
heart is big, and I fear nothing !" said IJpisico,
dwelling up as proudly as a peacock on a
Unniy morning in a clover field.
'  'Ie son of Arog hyadecka lies !" said a
dep, hollow voice in the rear, and both or
the young mn sprang to their feet, and
looked around to see from whence the voice
proceeded.
No one was in sight. Guy turned as pale
as a sheet and trembled with fear, while Ipisi-
co seenwd even more terrified than he.
"What was it ?" asked Guy, in a hoarse
whisper.
"A spirit-let us go from here!'' said Ipisi-
aa, while his teeth clattered together with his
shivering fear.
'-Stay I" said the same voice, in a hollow
tone.
"The Lord save us - what can it be ?"
ped Guy, and he sunk down to the ground
m the very weakness of his abject fear.
Ipisico also cowered down to the earth,
and drew his embroidered blanket over his
head, as if to hide front his view some horri-
ble vision which liis terror painted to his
Mind.
"Who spoke" at last said Guy, gathiering
wurage, because he saw some one npproach-
ng, at a distance, from toward the mansion.
'o this question'he received no reply, and
seeiniz that those who were approaching were
ao other than his uncle and the schoolmaster,
who frequently walked in the grove while

they talked and smoked their evening pipsa1
he said
"Rlouxepip, Ipisico, rouse up, and act like a
man. I'm mict ai'ad .
m'Tis false !t s tithe same hollow voice,
and Guy, even though his uncle was now
c:ose by, started from the spot, niid hurried
away, as if death was in the very atmosphere
of the liace- ..
" W hat the deuce is the matter here ? My
nephew running away like a scared sheep,
and this cub Inian doubled u  in a heap,
with his blanket over his head ." cried air
William, as lee approached the spot.
"Get up, Ipisico. What are you trembling
for ?"
"A spirit, great chief, a spirit ." moaned
the Indian.
"The spirit of the devil !"
Yes, great clef, yes-it spoke to us!-
" Here, you Guy, conic back hIe;e and tell
us what tis means !" shouted Sir John to h.s
nephew, who was yet within call, although
hurrying toward the house.
With a downcast face, anid a shCeepish ex-
pression, the young ian came back and told
Sir Wilhiam that, wlne he and lpisico were
talking, a stratige voice spoke to them, and
not being able to discover any oue, they
were frghleiied, because they believed it to
be a spirit.
"You are both fools and cowards !" said
Sir William, contemptuously, for he was no
believer iii spirits. " Look around among
the trees, O'W hacker, and see if there is any
one about! "
" livil the one, Sir William !" replied the
latter.after making athoroughsearch. "Per-
haps they were a plotting soie kind o' mis-
chief, and 'twas the voice of conscience that
spoke to 'emc. I've heard of the likes o' that
-of voices that wouldn't let the murderer
slape, or the wicked one rest! "
"They had better beware how they plot
any mischief, or attempt to execute it on my
domainn" sail Sir Wilhiam, sternly. "I will
make brief trial and speedy punshment re-
dress all evil here ! Of that, Master Guy, you
and your friend can reniain assured !"
Having said this, lee walked on, and soon
disappeared in the darker recesses of the
grove, with OYWhaekem, while Guy and his
companion hastened to the house, for they
dared not stay there.
They had been gone but a few moments,
when from the thick branches of a short,
stumpy spruce, a iian descended. Ills garb
and features were those of an Indiani, nut his
face was bleached almost to whiteness, as if
by long ilhiess or confinement. his frame
was attenuated, his eyes sunken, and his hair
long and white as snow. IIe looked the very
picture of one Iwho had suffered long, and be-
come old before his tune.
lie said nothing, but shook his clenched
hand threateningly in the direction which had

been taken by the young men, and then
walked away im a route different from that
taken by Sir William, yet one leading into
the densest part of the grove. his steps were
now and feell, for he seemed half famished
and very weak.
ChIAPTER XI-
When Dyagetto tetnrned to the village
from which she had been absent so many
years, at first scarce one of her former acquaint-
ances, or even her relatives, knew her; for
she was young, and exceedingly beautiful,
when she suddenly disappeared from them,with
her two little children--one a babe, and the
other just able to walk. It was on the night
after the body of her husband-brutally mur
dered, and so disfigured that he could only be
recognized by his clothing and weapons-had
been discovered near his wigwam; and many
supposed that, in her frenzy, she had east her-
self and her children into the swift rapids of
the "Little Falls" of the Mohawk, near which
she dwelt at that time. But some there were
who knew of the ambition of one man in the
tribe, and of his emnity to Ogahtee, who had
won Dyagetto, though the first was also a
suitor for her hand, who felt more than a mere
suspicion that he had removed her and the
heir to the chieftainship of Ogahtee, that he
might, through a strange influence which he
held over Sir William Johnson, the king's su-
perintendent, be elevated to the murdered
chieftain's place. And though Arogh yadecka
got the place, and was brave, wise, and politic,
and, by his liberality to his tribe and his own
self-denial, managed to become popular with
most of his peole-althiough, as I said be
fore, sonic there were who regarded him with
dark suspicion; for the murderer of Ogahtec
was never known with certainty, although the
charge was laid to an Onondago Indian, who
disappeared that night from their village,
where he had a squaw, and was never seen
again.
But when Dyagetto told her name, and her
altered features were remembered, great were
the rejoicings of her relatives, and warm was
the welcome which was given to the widow
of the late chief. But when she was ques-
tioned about her absence, where had she been,
and where were her children, she was silent,
on~y telling them that it was not the will of
the Great Spirit that she should then inform
them, but in time they should know all.
They hastily prepared a feast for her, and
all of the head women of the tribe gathered
there to do her honor. With sad dignity she
reeeived and thanked them ; but, while she
begged them to eat and be merry, she refused,
for, said she:
"My heart is very heavy! I remember
Ogabtee, and look back through the darkness,

and the rain of many tears, to the bright time
when lie played the love-wreath upon my
head ! Let me go to his grave and weep, and
then, when my heart is more light, I willd-
come and hear your songs."
They could but assent, and honor he' for
that sorrow which time could not lessen, but
which was still fresh, like the ever-living
spring, or that plant which lives while love
lives, or the opal-gem w:iieh shines until af-
fection dies.
And we will leave her to make that sad pil-
grimage amid moonlight and shadow--for seat-
tered clouds were moving athwart the sky-
while we look elsewhere'to the doings of an-
other of the characters in our life drama.
Down below the Little Falls only a short
distance, upon the southern bank of the river,
was a deep ravine, which appeared--although
no water ran through it then-to have been
deeply cut in the lofty precipice of rock which
overliangs that bank by a stream, for the marks
of the torrent were plainly to be seen in the
gullied, and seamed, and smooth-worn rocks
on either side. It was a dark and gloomy
gorge, too narrow and too rough to invite the
tread of man, and so overhung with thick
evergreens and tangled vines, that aot even
the sun, at mid-day, could pierce its gloom.
Into this gorge, on the night of the same
day when he had left Ipisieo in the care of
Sir William Johnson, at or near the hour, of
midnight, old Aroghyadecka might have been
seen to enter. His step was light aad can-
tious, and ihe frequently looked back to se if
any one had followed him or was watching
his motions. Ie bore in one hand a willow
basket, which contained a quhutity Qf dried
meats ; with the other lie carried 11s gun.
Slowly up the dark ravine, along a path
which nothing but being used to could enable
him to tread, he made his way, pausing, every
little while, to listen. Along thus lie went,
until he reached the face of a rock which
seemed to jut out so as to admit of no further
passage in that direction, and where the ra-
vine narrowed to not more than tea feet at
the bottom, and less at the top. With a light
bound lie erossed to a ledge upon the other
side, turned a projecting corner, and stood in
a small cave or recess, which, at a first glance,
looked as if it had been quarried out by the
hand of man ; yet it was natural.
here he paused, and, taking out flint and
steel, soon struck a light, and ignited a torch
of light-wood, of which there was a small store
piled in the cave. Sticking this in a crevice
of the rock, he took away a heavy square
stone, which lie could barely lift, from the back
part of the small cave, and then it could be
seen that this was really only the mouth of a
large cave beyond, which had been walled up,
for from far vithiin the dark and gloomy apace
beyond could be heard the sound of falling
waters. A buckskin rope appeared to be fas.

broke upon his ear, and choked his utterance
in in instant. And it so terrified him that lie
fled from the s1ot with a speed which the pur-

ing for an instant, he fled away, nor did he
stop until lie was once more safe beneath the
bark roof of his wiiwam.
Once there, lie began to consider what it
was that had so terrified Jbini. Naturally su-
perstitious, he finally concluded that it must
hace been, what in his terror lhe first believed
it to be, a spirit--the spirit of one from the
grave!
CHAPTER XII.
Weeks rolled on, and to Tha'endanegea
they did not pass unpleasantly. Pleased within
and very attentive to his'studies, he became a
great tvorite with Mr. O'Whaekem, who,
even had he not been, would not have darea
to use the birch upon him as he did upon
some other of his pupils, for he had seen
enough of the young " Eagle" to pay proper
respect to his talons, which were as ieady as
his talents.
And with the rise of the sun each morning,
he led ont his fiery stallion, and, springing
upon his back, bounded away for nues over
 the plains that lay so level on the plategun
above the Mohawk. The horse now seemed
to be as fond of his young master as the let-
ter was of him-would go and come at his
call-kneel for him to mount, and act as gen-
tly as a lady's palfrey, without any one else
attempted to nount, or even approach him.
Not a groom about the stable, or a man upon
the premises, could do so, without his relax-
ing into his former terrible ferocity. Toward
Guy Johnson.ie exhibited a fiercer hatred
than to all the rest, and even Thayendanegea
could scarcely restrain him from plunging
upon him when his eyes fell upon the young
man, who, however, took the best of care to
keep out of his way.
And at night, or rather in the afternoon,
when the sun began to sink ira the west, and
the cool breezes to breathe amid the trees, the
young ladies and their brother John, and Ona-
1ova, all well mounted, would gallop out with

A'

Thavendanegea, and sometimes the old baro
net, niounited upon a sturdy hunter, woul4
join the cavalcade.
At other times, when free from their studies,
Joh instructed Thavenda ne rea in the use  f
the sword. but soon found that his pupil was
his equal if not his master ; and  hean it cane
to the use of the tomahawk, the bow, or even
the rifle, Thayendanegea hand no equal on fa
estate-not one who could even approach to
his skill.
With two exceptions, the young indian haid
not an enemy on the place-not even thr ough
envy, that most potent of eieneiv-nukers.
The men liked him for his skill, his wiling-
ness, good nature, and courage-the women,
for his nirly beauty, combined with these,
though to them lie paid scarcely any atten-
tion.
The exceptions were Guy Johfson and Ipi.
sico. The former lad never foregtiven the first
slight put upon him by Tlhavendanegena, nor
lis~toss from the lack stallion--nor the son
of Aroghvadeeka, that he was looked up inas
a "Crow" and a "squaw " by the dashing ana
fearless young warrior, who never for a moo-
ment, in ay position, attempted to conceal
his contempt for him, or his hatrcd of his
father I
One evening. some four weeks after Thay-
endanegen had become a memriber of Sir' Wil-
liani's family, the cavalcale alluded to above,
incuding Sir William, started upon an even-
ing ride. Kathieen was mounted upon her
pretty white pony-Leonore upon a more
sober hay filly-Onalova npon a icious little
spotted pony, as full of " Old Nick" as herself
when she wanted to be-John upioni a spirited,
blooded animal, imported from England, and
Sir William upon his favorite hunter.  Of
course, Vesuvius and his bold riderled the
van.
The evening was Tather close, and the day
had been hot, and, as it was that season in the
latter part of summer when" sudden thunder-
storms are common, the proposed ride was
not intended to be a long one.
Seated in a shady spot near the house, Guy
andihisinscparableIpisico, with lowering looks,
watched the gay party as they rode oif, for,
though invited by Sir William, they never
could he induced'-to join in these rides.except
by a positive command, which lie wouhl not
give ; for, fowl of enjoyment himself, he would
not mar that of others, by forcing up1 on1 thema
unwilling and disagreeable eomlany.  For
lisagrecable it would have been. Ipisico was
not liked by any of the party, for lie lad
become morose, sullen, and sulky-and Guy
was only liked by one, the gentle Leonore,
who hld been a favorite of his father while lie
lived, and who, at an early age, had, lay the
mutual agreement of the two parent-b.irothers,
been betrothed to Guy, whom she was to
marry when he arrived at his majority.

Jimber for a Ihridge-the fearful frce of a hr-
ricane burst upon them in its terrible might.
It was so string that it drove the heavy rain
along horizontally, in a fine iiiit, sent limbs
and leaves lyiing through the air, nd drtshei'
hundreds of trees in every direction to the
earth.
"iffy father must not ride on-the great
trees will fill and crush him!" said 'I'hayen

eomf'usion of mmid, was trying to spur his
horse past thie oemng, which wtas their only
place of safety from breaking nhms amid fall-

firmly, seized the bridle of the baronet's tnos.
and led thin imito the centre or the cieaird
space, beckoimng to the others to follow.
This .they didl as best they were able, for
their terrified horses were ahniost unmainmagea-
ble. Yet the black stallion showed to more
sign of fear than his master.
" By ty life, lad, but thy coolness has
saved the hvltke of us !" exclaimed the baro-
net, as he dismounted from his horse, and re-
garded anxiously the falling trees and luge
birancles, which were feehing the force of the
hurticaite. "Dismounrt, childrei-your horses
tmay start, and it would be death, certain
death, to tide along that road now."

pony was quite as uneasy as any other of the
hoises.
Soon she had cause to regret this reckless-
ness ;for, as a huge old hemlock came crash-
ing to the ground, ut a tfew yards from them,
,      the ponu y took fright, and, iii spite of voice
and rin, hounded down the road, and she
could tot stop hhin.
"IDo not moveI" cried Thayenanegea to
her terrified father and relatives ; I will save
her !'
And-ie gave a loose rein to his noble horse,
mand. with a word urged him forward. In a
monimnt- mnml it was not second too soon--lie
war it lier side, fo r a huge old pine, that had
nunmbered centuries where it stood, reeled an
inst it amid crttnie crashing through the other
trees, right toward time spot where she was.
With a uianut's strength, thme young Indian bent
antd sunched her from the saddle with one
n'm, while lie wheeled his horse with the
other, and struck himii in the fanks with both
heels.  With one mighty bound, the horse
leapd brick clear of the danger, while the
pony,1 fined front its burthen, bounded for-
wrdl, an. escaped being crushed by only a
few feta, mmml the ige tree fi'll exactly where
she would have ihen had it not been for the
arm of    bold young brave.
'l'hiaendimneim a, bearing Kathleen. tenderly
in his ar'ims-for she was now senseless from
terror-"-rode hack to the group itt the clearing,
and resigned her to the care of her father amidt
sister, who, alitost dumb with fear and anx-
iety, had witnessed her peril and her rescue.

Ask tny gif.t i omy power, and it shall be

any denial!" cried the overjoyed baronet.
"Evetn if it be her hand as thy bride, thou
shalt have it '!"-
" Thayendanegea asks nothing. The Pale-
Rose is safe, and he is contented I" said the
brave youth, even though' lier eyes were
opening upon him nwiithi a look of love and
gr'atitud1, for she had so far recovered as to
he'r and understand her father's words.
She sighed a she heicard his calm reply, and
her bosom rose amndl fell, and the color in her
cheeks weit and came, and two pearly tears
,      came out of her great blue eyes, and stole
silently down ,er cheeks --wherefore, she
scarcely md~lred to ask herself.
''hie storms passed away almost as rapidly
as it hint come m, anid before the hour of the

their path, most of which t hey were olblig d
to pass around, for they were so protected by
their chevaux-de-frise of' branelis that to leap
over them' was frequently itpossible.
Night was upon'thembefore they emerged
from  the wood, but the bright 'moon and
countless stars shone from a cloudless sky,
and daikness did not incotmode them  The
atmosphere, made'cool and pume lV the elec-

who, silent and half-tearful, rode as near to
her preserver as she could. 1 need not say
who it was.
When the-party arrived at the uall, Tpisico
and Guy were on the piazza watching them.

"The Great Spirit imust have held his hand

CIIAPTER XV.
Night, still and calm, lay lightly over the
earth, for the moon and stairs looked softly
down upon it, mirroring their sweet faces in
the lakes, silvering the rippuin streams anld
gemming thecascades auml rushing brooks--
inuking the dew-drops glitter on the spray
and peeping in amid the branches and the
hlowet's, playing hide-and-sreel; with the sha-
dows as the'branches gently waved to nd fro.
It was midnight, or after, when Sir William,

Gny, now livid with rage, at being so fairly;
cornered.
"Master Guy Johnson, you are the nephew
of a baronet, and the son of an Irish jintle-
man, and I'm only a poor followerof the great
Eseulapius, but, b  the powers o' light and
darkness, if you d on't ato those words, and
apologize for them in just one minute, I'll
horsewhip you till you wear all the colors of
the rainbow on your dirty back !" said the
doctor, dropping his instruments and snatch-
ing up a team-whip, which happened to be
lying near at-hand.
"Touch me if you dare, you miserable
devil !" shouted Guy, who was now actually
beside himself with rage, forgetting who was
by.
The doctor waited for no second invitation,
but plied the whip with a heavy and a skill-
ful hand, and with such effect that Guy in an
instant ran yelling to the house, pursued by
his now heated punisher, who gave him a cut
at every leap, and only relinquished the pur-
suit when the young villain had entered the
house.
The doctor now returned to the baronet,
and said :..
"I beg your pardon, Sir William, for using
this weapon in your presence, but I've borne
insult and injury too long from that fellow to
stand more, anJ I'll let no man living call me
a liar to my face, when I'm only spaking truth
before God and man !"
"I do not blame you at all, Daly," said Sir
William ; "lie richly deserved more than you
gave him, and if lie were not the son of my
dead brother, he should not restanotherlhour
beneath my roof!"
"Would you have me patch up this bit o'
disfiguration, Sir William ?" asked the doctor,
much pleased at not incurring blame from his
patron, while he pointed at Ipisico.
" Yes, do the best you can for him. I do
not blame him so much now as I did ; for I see
plainly that Guy has but used him as a tool
in the matter. The Indian knew no better,
and Guy did. Use all your care and skill for
the poor devil-when he gets able to talk he
may tell us all about itI"
Ipisico, whose eyes till now had only flash-
ed anger and hatred, seemed touched by these
words cf the old nobleman, and seizing the
hand of the latter, he pressed it to his heart,
and looked grateful at him, as if to express
thanks for-the one kind expression, when he
so little deserved it.
"Let the men earety him in carefully,
Daly !" said the baronet, "and order any-
thimg from my stores which you deem neces-
sary."
"I'll do all that lays in my power, Sir Wil-
liam !" said the doctor, as the baronet return-
ed to his house and lbed, for the chill night
air did not feel very comfortable to an e orly
man, thinly dressed.

t"I didn't know that you was a master of
two professions before, doctor!" said John
Johnson, after his father had left.
"It bothers the sowl o' me to know what
ye mane, Master John!" said the doctor, with
a puzzled look.
" Why, you're a doctor to begin with, and
,a first-rate dancing-master to boot. I never
sa# any one learn a running hornlpipe quicker
than cousin Guy did, just now, in all my
life ."
"Faith, if lie keeps on as he's begun, he'll
learn, like Dick Turpin, to dance on nothin'
in the end, with a bit o' twisted flax knotted
under his ear! One thing is sure, he'll never
die like a Christian, in his behl or, like a dacet
man, on-the field of honor '"
"Maybe he'll challenge you in the morn-
ing," said John, with a laugh.
" Divil the bit wil lhe. There's no such
good luck in store for Pat Daly as to make
him die a giatale death, with a bit o' lead
snug laid in the right spot. But if he can
hire a red nager-I beg your pardon. Master
Thayendanegea, it's not the likes o' you I
iane, so you needn't look so black at inc---f,
I say, he can hire some one to stick a knife
into me in the night-time, why he'll be just
the one to get that sort o' satisfaction. But
I'll be as like a potato as if I was one-bless-
ed be the esculent forever, for it's the Pain-
disc-apple of my country-eyes all over and
none of 'em aslape !"
"Hardly would lie dare that!" said John.
" The divil trust hifn for all me. The man
that would have the throat of a poor baste cut
to spite a poor, tender-hearted young lady.
wouldn't spase me, I'm sure !" said.thie doctor.
While this conversation was going ; on, the
physician had been busy in preparing lpisico
for removal, and he now bade the men around
to take him up carefully, and carry him to
the neat little hospital which Sir William had
built near his mansion.
ChIAPTER XVI.
Upon the morning after the occurrences
above mentioned, Sir Willit m sent for his
nephew, ordering that he should come to hin
in his library.
After considerable delay, the voung man
made his appearance, looking very much as
one would who had been caught stealing a
sheep, whipping a woman, or in some other
equally despicable action.
"You are very tardy, nephewv Guy, in
obeying my summons, this morning." said
Sir William, not angrily, for he had just taken
his " morning nip," to get up an appetite for
breakfast. " Methiink, if I'd sent Dr. Daly
after you, he would have hurried you up a
little. He is a famous hand at that! I could
but adnire your agility, and his skill, last
night 1"

Guy was startled at the thought of being

was capable of loviug, nl hoped, when lie

and will meet the penalty without a mur-

that I have given to John-five guineas a
month. Half of that I shall holl baek, until

You can keep back all, sir-I have no
right to murmur, since it is your generosity
alone which allows me anything
"Not a word, sir ! My judgment in this
matter is iniperative I For your attempted
wrong to Thiaycndanegea, you must apologize
publicly tohiii !"
"Uncle, you surely will not make me so
lower myself as to apologize to hue ?"
" Lower yourself, sir, by an apology to one
as much your superior as day is to night! If
you, who could hire an ignorait savage to do a
dastardly dced iii the night, vlhicli you dared
not do, can lower yourself still further, I
would like to know how it can be done !" cried
the baronet, now thoroughly -m0ry. " Come,

their morning walk. Either go up to him
like a man, and isay you are sorry for what

leave my house forever ! I wilt have no one f
around me who can deliberately do a base
wrong to another, and refuse torepair it, so
far as he can. You hear me, sir ?"
Guy knew that he could not trifle wi'itli his
uncle then, and that for him all was lost, uin-
less lie obeyed the mandate instantly. There-
fore, he advanced to the approaching party,
an said ;
Thavendanegea, I tried   to have your
horse killed last nightI It was all my fault,
not that of Ipisico. I am  sorry for it -will

The young brave stopped short, and looked
at Guy with., quiet wonder-looked at him
keenly, as if he would read his motive for this
most unnatural act on the part of Guy, so
unlike his general character, but made no
reply.
"Forgive him, Thayendanegea, for my sake,
even as I forgive him for having my poor
pony killed !" said Kathleen, and tears started
from her blue eyes.
"I forgive you, for the sake of the Pale
Rose !" said Thayendanegea, with gentle dig.
nity. " And if you will be a man iow, I will
be your friend !"
And lhe advanced and offered Guy his hand.
The latter could not refuse it, lint a burn-

The baronet, who hal closely watched the
actions of both. was struck with the noble
dignity of the young brave, both in his ac-
tions and his words.
 God's life, hut the lad is fit for a throne I"
he sai  to himself.
Th p:rty passed into the house now, for
the' eakfast-hell wis ringing. There were
tears .n the eyes of both Leonore and Kath-
leen, izs they passed along. And they were
not tisrs of grief.
CIIAPTEL XVII.
Moo-lil, with the fire of anger anl of hate
bnrnii d(eep into his heart, Guy Johnson
waled fitr away into the beautiful grove
bank of the mnaision, on the morning when he.
made his forced apology, for he had no appe-
tite for breakfast, and left the table as soon
as he'could do so, without attracting particu-
lar attention.
And when he had got beyond hearing of
those in the house, bitter curses'rose from
his lips, and his angry words were not only
many, but loud. lie did not know that he
was'closely followed--.followed by one whose
hart ached, nob only for his troubles, but
also to hear such terrible language from his
lips. lie did not know hut that he was alone,
until a Lrentle hand w;as laid upon his shoul-
der, and a sweet voice said
"Guy, lear Guy, do not talk so---you are
surely ~raving, arid do not mean what you
eay I
"I do mean every word I utter, Leonore !"
said lie. imputieutly. " What business have
you to follow inc like a spy, and overhear
what I say ?"
Oh! Guy, dear Guy, why do you speak
so to sac ? You will break niy heart" said
the weeping girl.
"Women's hearts are made of leather-
there is no danger of their breaking !"
ller sobs were the only reply to his unUwanly
words.
Everybody hates me and wrongs me !"
he continued.
"Oh, no, no ! I love you, and never wrong-
ed you in thought, word, or deed !" she re-
pli..
"My uncle, because he has taken a liking
to a heathen bear of an Indian, first robs me
.0 please him, and then forces mae to the al-
ternative of either becoming a homeless oit-
east, or of bending my proud neck and knee
to his upstart favorite, humbling myself to
$n Indian dog-for that Thayendaitegea is
hut a dot !"

would have crushed her !"=
"Curse him  and her! I wish to God that
it had crushed themr bobh 1" ~

Oh, Guy; Guy, eow    cmian you be
wicked ?"
. "And ?/Ou, too, must take up for this graes
less heathen ! Perhaps you want him for o
husband !" he cried.
"Guy, you do me, a foul wronr, and %lch
words come with an ill, grace from your lip.
to one who has stood by you so often when
she knew you were wrong, and lms so often
dared her father's anger to avert it from your
head !"
"Clear out, then, and leave me alone, i
you don't like my words ! I didn't ask yoe
to follow me !" said he, in the most brutal
tone.
"Guy, dear Guy, even this will I bear, fot
the love I feel for you !"' she cried, weepin,
and attempting to put her arnis around his
neck.
With a bitter curse, he thrust her from
him, with such force that she fell, and bes
head coming in contact with the sharp edge
of  a stone, received a terrible cut. The blood
gushed out in a large stream, for a small ar-
tery in the temple had been divided. But the
poor girl was not sensible of paini-she had
fainted.
When he saw blood, the anger of the hear
less wretch gave way to terror.
"My God, I have'killed her !" lie groaned
" What shall I do ! what shall I do t"
"Go 'get water !" said a stern voice, and
the same white-haired, venerable, and feeble-
looking Indian, whom we have once before
spokeni of, as being seen in that same grove,
stepped forward from amid a clump of small
spruce trees, to the astonishment and increased
terror of the young villain.
What shall I bring it in ?" asked the ter
rifled youth.
* "That," and the Indian touched the glazed
cap on Guy's head.
The latter hurried away to a brook, whose
.distant murmurings could reach the ear,
while the old Indian bent upon his knees, and
raised the head of the poor girl. Her couna-
tenance was as white as the leaf of a litv, and
life seemed almost to have deserted le?.
With a firm hand lie held the parts of the
wound closely together, then taking a scarf
from her neck, bound it so tightly around her
temples that he checked the flow of blood.
And when the water came, he washed away
the blood-stains, bathed her face, and wette
her lips with some of it.
With a deep sigh, she opened her eye,
and exhibited signs of returning conscione-
ness.
"Where am J?   Oh, I remember !" she said;
with a shudder. "Guy was angry, and struck
me !" and she closed her eyes again, as if to
shut out the vision of cruel remembrance.
" Who are you, sir, that are so kind to
me ?" she asked, a moment after, as shn
looked up at the kind and pitying face of the

the Indian. in a tone and-with a look which
would imply that he was seriously thinking of
the proposition.
" Yes," answered Guy.
And you love his daughter, the lily which
you bruised this morning ?"
"Yes, and when he is dead'I will marry
her-"
"lie brought you up since you was a little
helpless boy, without father and mother, did
he not.?"
"Yes; but Low do you know that? Have
you ever seen me before this day ?"
Yes. yes, a hundred times, when you was
too snill to crawl over a log."
Well, well, it matters not. What is your
answer to 'm proposition ?"
'hat I thank the Great Spirit I am not a
pale-thee! Do your own murders!    I am
not an assassin !" said the old Indian, and,
turning proudly upon his heel, he disappeared
in the thick gloom of the grove, before the
youth had recovered from the surprise into
which the indignant and bitter tone of the
scornful Indian had thrown him.
"By heavens, what a fool I am !" he mutter-
ed, when he found himself alone. "I should
have killed the old wretch, for he possesses
my secret, thought and intent, and if he should
make it known to my uncle, my every hope
would be blasted. I will never venture out
without my gun again, and, if I see him, I
will shoot him as I would a wolf!"
"Shoot him, and I will shoot you?" said
Thayendanegen, quietly, but firmly, as he
stepped lout from behind the trunk of a huge
pine tree within a few feet of him.
"Why? Do you know him?" cried Guy,
turning pale, and trembling from head to
fuot.
"No !" answered the young brave. "But
he is an old man and an Indian-lie is good,
for he would not do a murder at your bidding!
You could not hire him, as you did Ipisico, to
do your wicked-work ! You are less than a
dog-that would never bite the hand which
fed it !"
"Why should you act the spy upon me?"
" Because your heart is blacker than mud !
Yot are bad-too bad to live! I will watch
every step you take, and, if you raise your
hand or evil eve to one thing which I love,
or is helpless,I will kill you as I would a
snake !"
"I suppose you will go and tell my uncle
of this titter !"
"I am no tale--bearer !" proudly relied the
young Indian. "I can watch over him with-
out putting more fear or hatred in his heart.
But you must not cross my path, or study evil'
to him or his, or I will kill you ! I have
spoken, and I cannot speak a lie !"
Thavendanegea said no more, but, with a
'itter look of contempt and scorn, turned upon

his heel and went toward the mansion, leaving
the baffled nephew of the baronet in no env-
able state of mind.
CHAPTER XIX.
It was the custom with Dr. Daly, Mi.
O'Whackem, and Mr. Lafferty, the 'baronet's
secretary, to meet at twelve o'clock eaeh day,
or immediately after the schoolmaster had dis-
missed his pupils to their dianeri, to partake
of a lunch and its spiritual accompaninente,
in a pleasant little refreetory adjoining the
htoslital, for these gentlemen all dined at tiq
haronet's talde at a later hour. And it was
the occasion, generally, for a lively bit of goa.
silp, for, all three being Irishmen, they could
no more get along without talking, than a co-
quette without a string of beaux. Thus they
kept the ir spirits up, while the spirits and the
jokes went dovn.
"IIow does your new patient look this
morning, doctor dear ?" asked O'Whackem of
Daly, as he poured out his glass of brandy, at
lunch time.
"Very much as if a horse had kicked himr,"
replied the doctor, with a smile, as he e.
tended his hi'id for the bottle.
"he'll be apt to prefer sour healing power
to the heeling way of the ould stallion, Pm
after tlhinkini," said Lafferty, reaching in turd
for the brandy.
"lie's divifish impatient for a. patient," said
Daly, as he helped himself to a slice of cold
tongue and a cold potato.
"He'll know better than to be so horse-styk
again !" said Lafferty.
"Och, ye blackguard, ye ought to be'co -
victed, without judge or jury, of murder"
cried O'Whackem.

"The king's Endish, Misther Quilldivper,"

"It's a pity that Master Guy hadn't got a

Lafferty.                           .
"Sure lie got a good enough tasting from

Thus these three worthies spiced their lunch,
but it was soon over, and they returned to

body and mind.
CH APTER XX.
On the morning succeeding the night when
ice came so near getting his well-merited
sw, of having the life kicked out of hint
ur William sent a runner to Aroghyndecka, to
seuaint'bim that his son had beeti injured
-             and was in serious danger. Though the run
cr, after delivering his message, started in
s*antly upon his return, and was well kntowi
t. be one of the swiftest-of his class, the oh
s ief quickly outstripped him, and lngere hi
" - -         bd even sighted the chimney-tops of "John
si Hall," had passe its threshold, and stood
before the baronet

"Where is my son?-wliere is Jpisico?-
and who has dared to hrt him ?" ae.d the
old Mohawk, with trembling frame and flash.
iag eyes.
"Sit down and calm yourself, and I will teU
you," replied the baronet. "Ie has put his
fingers in the time, anr: burned himself!"
The chief, who knew    the baronet well
enough to be sure he would gain nothiting by
disobeying him, took the sent.
Pontiocht, here ! Bring brandy and glasses
for two-pi pes, also!" cried the baronet to his
favorite servant.
The old chief sat very uneasily-for a won-
der, even the anticipation of brand and to-
bacco did ant quiet his feelings.
It soon came ; and, after each had drank a
glass, the baronet lighted his pipe and coin'
meneed smoking, quietly and in silence. For
a time, the Indian preserved his stoicim, but
finally the feelings of the parent triumphed
over the philosophy-if such it can be termed
--of the Indinn, and le abruptly asked
Where is Ipisie I"
In the hospital," replied  Sir William,
without deigning to give any further explana-
tion.
The Tndaian rose, did not pause to touch his
glass, which the baronet had refilled, but
walked from the oom , without uttering a
word, and took his way hastily to the hos-
pital.
I.esoon after came back, and his face was
dark, very dark, with either gloom or linger.
Ile sat down, and, for a time, reinainc(d silent.
lIe did not touch his brandy, and he had let
the fire in his pipe go out.
Sir William n remained as passive as before,
drinking and smoking with mll the ease imag-
inable, apparently not noticing the looks of
the old chief, yet from under his over-
hanging brows casting many a quick and
searching glance at him. No Indian coukl
ever beat him, either in the study of the
thoughts or another, or in concealing his
owni. For years an official visitor at their
councils-of'ten the sole arbiter of their af.
fairs, the medium  through whom they re-
ceived alh their presents from the English
government-he 11nd so become used to them
that neither their arts, nor any personal dan-
ger to himself, could throw him of' his guard,
a or roh him of his self-possession.
" Whimt or who hurt my son so terribly?
He never vill be a muan again !" at last said
the old chief.
,    "LIe never ought to be !" said Sir William,
- sternly. "If ie had been a man, he would
- not have been hurt !" and lie then detailed
the attempt of Ipisico to kill the horses, find
d its result.
e    The old chief listened in silence, until the
baronet was through. Then lie said
d    "M  sosn ws a fool!. I miam sorry Le was
not killed'! 1 will see him no more! When

he can walk, send him away from you, but
not to me, for he shall never enter my
lodge !"
"No--I will be kind to him, and try to
make a good man of him !" said the baronet.
The oil chief made no reply, but drank
his brandy, relighted his pipe, and went
away.
ChIAPTER XX!.
When old Aroghyadeeka left the mansionI
of Sir William, as recorded in our last chap-
ter, he moved quietly on, apparently en-
grossed in thought, for some distance, a half
mile or Inure, until he entered the forest,
which lay westward of the house. Here he
moved on more rapidly, following a trail,
narrow an1 straight, as Indian paths gener-
ally are, which led toward his village. He
had not proceeded fir along this road, when
he was met by an individual, so singular in
looks, dress, and character, that he merits a
particular description at our hands, the more
especially because this is our first introduc-
tion to him.
He was rather tall, lean, and bony in figure,
but his broad shoulders, long arms, and bowed
legs indicated considerabel sinewy strength.
His form was so bent forward, that, coupled
with a short neck, it seemed to give him a
kind of humpbacked appearance. his head,
as large, more red, and full as round as a
Kinderhook cabbage, was surmounted by a
mop of tangled yellow hair; his eyes were of
a glassy gray, generally dull and heavy, yet
bright and flashing, when he was excited.
His nose was very small, and sunken in be-
tween his large, pufty cheeks, like a small
squash between two big pumpkins.     His
wide mouth, ever open, revealed a snaggy set
of teeth, well colored with tobacco juice.
It would be hard to judge of his age--he
had suoh a dried up-look-but he probably
was thirty, perhaps five years ahead of it.
His dress was as odd as his personal ap-
pearance. A very ragged,,old felt lint, minus
the rim, was on 'top of his head, and in its
erown the tail of a racoon served for a plume.
A coarse frock, or hunting shirt, descending
to his knees, and girded to his waist by a
stout rop) , made of twisted thongs of huck-
skin, and as ragged as it well could be and yet
stick together, served to partially coyer the
upper part of his person. Through the rents
of this a butternut-colored flannel undershirt
could be seen. Trowsers, or rather leggins,
of undressed deer-skin, and moccasins of
moose-hide, completed his dress.
A powler-hrn and bullet pouch were slung
over his shoulder, and in his belt lie wore a
knife and hatchet. A long pipe, of red clay,
such as were used by the Dutch of that day,
was also in ri belt. Upon his shoulder lie
carried ov et those heavy, long; bell-muzzled

''a

pieces, brass-mounted and flint-locked, which
were known as the  Queen's Airm," carrying
an ounce and a half ball, or a single handful
of slugs, as the caprice of the loader dictated,
and calculated to do damage at any distance
under half a mile, if properly directed.
With a kind 'of limping, staggering gait,
and a lek-lustre look, whi b seemed rather
that of an idot, than that of a man possessed
of his full senses, this individual met the old
Mohawk hiief in the trail.
The latter started as he saw him, and looked
annoyed, for it is well known that Indians of
every nation hold idiots and insane persons in
reverence and awe, and fear to either harm or
displease them.
It is Hlon Yost," muttered the old chief.
"Why should lie cross my path so often t
Three times 'I have seen him since the sun
come up!"
" Hallo, olt Devil-bug I vere you peen all
the vines, eh? Been a gittin' trunk on uncle
Sir Pill's prandy, eli ?" criedl the stranger, as
he stopped, and brought the butt of his heavy
gun down upon the hard ground, with a far
that made its iron ramrod ring in the socket.
"Why ter tuivel ton't you speak mit me, you
tan red-skin fool !" lie added, in his strong
Dutch accent, as the old chief paused, but did
not at once reply.
"My heart is heavy, and my tongue is slow
for words !" replied the Indian. "Where is
my brother going ?"
"Goin' vere der tuyvel tells me to-vere
there's vitehes and vizards, and prandy and
primstone-dings vot I lives on !" cried Hon
Yost. "Shall I tell you vere you're 'fraid to
go, oldl Devil-bug?"
"Aroghyadecka is not afraid to go any-
where !" said the old chief, sternly. "_is
heart knows no fear."
"Dat's a tam lie, a tam lie !" cried Hon
Yost. "You knows peter as to go to de cave
in do rock, pelow der Little Falls, for fear
you see de spook of'somebody starved to
death !
The Mohawk started and trembled, when
he heard these words.
"TThe Evil Spirit tells Aim everything
muttered he, at last.
"Yaw I What Hon Yost don't know, no-
podaly knows, old Devil-bug S" said the man,
with a wild laugh, and lie re-shouldered. his
gun, and went on, while the old chief moved
aside to let him pass.
For several minutes the chief stood and
watched the receding form of the German,
and his looks, while he did this, betokened
both fear and hatred. But lie said -nothing,
and, when the 'rnn was hidden from his view
by intervening bushes,'the chief resumed his
course.
I-n Yost had not yet reached the clearing
of the Johnson domain, when a low whistle
from a clump of bushes upo his right, caused

"Yaw ; but den I shall yustmcharge a pottle
of praundy for de privilege !"
The baronet did not reply, but led the way
to his store-room, where he kept a vast variety
of airs, munitions, and such cheap goods/as
were needed by the class of Indinus, fron-
tiersmrren, and settlers around himr. Here he
fitted lion Yost out with the arms which lie
had solicited, and the blankets and calico
promised ; also giving him some snuff and
tobacco for his mother, an old gipsy of a
woman whom the baronet had long known.
Antd amused as ie ever was by the drolleries
of hor Yost, he plied him pretty well with
liquor, and, when ie finally tired of him, sent
him away with a bottle full, telling him to be
sure and bring him some venison on the next
day, which the German faithfully promised
to do.
CHAPTER     XXIII.
I have gazed, in foreign lands, upon many a
lofty palace-upon many a uarble tower-
many a galmt looking castle! And at home
have seen Art's choicest works of triumph I
Monuments-wherq tire architect, tihe sculptor,
tie painter, had lavished all their skill ! Yet,
in the deep, still shadows of the mighty trees
of the forest, beneath the broad-spread, ever-
green branches of pine, and spruce, and hem-
lock, I have seen the shanty of bark, rough
outside, but vlhte inside as driven snow, and
smooth as marble, impervious to the wind, or
rain, or snow, whieh seemed to me more coin.

Another startling and fearful yell, and a

by a circutous route, for the pantlie seemed

The llian, quickly snatching the bottle
from the ground, ran with all speed to the
fire, and when lion Yost got there, the carter
was seated by the entrance to the shanty, very
quietly smokig his pipe.
"in't yoU hear dat pi paiter, gran-

"Dunder, put it makes me feel goot, to
hear you talk dat vay !' said lion Yost.
And then he took out the handsome piece
of calico vhich Sir William had given to
him.              '
"here's someding vot you can make you
shirts mit! I told uncle Sir Pill I wanted it

as he exhibited this article.
I want no clothes but those I make from

while he was still looking' at the calico, he
said :" lon Yost was at the upper village,

" Yaw-two times have I peen dere
"Did you see a woman named I)yagetto ?"

"It my brother will hang this, in the night-

lodge, I will each day kill him plenty of game,
and I will make hinm  pretty dresses and
pouches from   hawn-skins and   porcupine
quills, which he can sell for money !" said
the indian
"iDat's a pargain; but for vy do you care
for dat wnuimui? Is she an old sweetheart of
yours, gratdaad?"
I will sometime tell you why I wish to
make her presents, and kill ganre for her, that
she may not be hungry. But she must not

It is good! May the Great Spirit bless
him !" sud the obl indian, and then, drawing
his new blanket around him, he retired with-
in the shanty, and laid down to sleep.
IIin Yost smoked his pipe out, replenished
the fuel on the fire, and then followed his ex-
iuiple. .
CIIAPTEI XXIV.
The sun was not more than two or three
hours high, on the next morning, when the
barouet belie hilion Yost approalhiing, bend -
iii iunlbr a heavy burthen. Upon his back
he carried a huge saddle of venison, with the
fit full two inCites thick upon the hesunich, and
strung to his belt wtse a dozen or more of
hue partridges, while a his left hand he car-

ried a string of brtsk trout, and ur.- hie
right to steady the game on lls shoulders, for
lie had left his gun behind him.
"Why, lion Yost; you are wonderfully
prompting making your payieunts, this time "
cried the baronet, as ire loMked'withi the adiir-
ling eye of a sportsmau upon the splenid lot
of game which the German laid down upon
the poirch before him.
"Yaw--maype I vants more trust, py-and-
py-den, if I pay goot now, you trust inc
more!" replied ion Yost.
"A very good reason, with a spice of sel-
fishness ; but how could you get together so
much game in so short a tune ? It wts dark,
or very nearly so iwhen you left here, lat
night!"
You know dat it is de olt saying, uncle
Sir Pill, 'a fool for.luck, undja rich man for
chiltren!'
"'A fool for luck, and a poor man for chil-
dren,' is the adage, lion Yost !"
"Den it's half truth, und de odder half a
tam lie'!" replied the Geriian.
"how so " asked the baronet.
"For v, lIm a afool, und I.have de goot
luck-you're rich, und you have more clil-
tren, red and vite, dan ea Icnount in a week I
I sees little Sir Plhs everysere I goes "
Thi baronet laughed at this huame-thrust,
for it was a fact which he could not deiny, an I
said:

IIon Yost ! Conic and get it !
Yaw, I'll go dat, uncle Sir Pill - but den

"You know my mother also ?"
"No one knows her better. But not even
to her must you speak of this meeting. And
now, come to my camp ; but, first, we will.
take the skin of the panther, and then you can
wash away the blood from your form, and I
will dress your scratches. It was a brave
fight, and I am glad that you killed the beast
without my help. But your aim was bad.
You fired ytoo low. A panther's heart is
small. You should have put your ball be-
tween his eyes !"
In a short time the hunter's proudest
trophy, the skin of the tiger of the north, was
taken off, and then Thayendanegea followed
the old Indian to his camp.
The eyes of Thayendandgea looked with
surprise at the comfortable shanty, and he
asked : "how long have you lived here ?"
"More than twelve moons !" replied the'old
man.
"And have not been to the Hall, which is
only three or four miles away ?"
"No ; I am known there,"but do not wish
to go there until the time set by the Great
Spirit. I have watched over you and Ona-
lova and Dyagetto, your mother, when you
all were sleeping! hear these words, but
repeat them not There is a cloud over you
now, b)ut the Great Spirit will blow it away !"
" Thayendanegea believes your words !
And he will obey !" said the young Indian,
thoughtfully and with respect.
Tlien, as his eye fell upon the work upon
which the old Indian had been engaged, lie
said :
" You must know lion Yost, for he brings
such things as those to the hall to sell
"Yes; lion Yost is a good man, and is
here very often!"
"Talk of der duyvel, and he is pound sure
te yunmp up right afore ye!" cried our old Ger-
man friend, who, hearing voices at the camp,
had approached noiselessly.  "Vy, here is
iThayendanegea h" he added. "Got in him-
mel,'vot have you peen about? All plood and
dirt--dunder--did you kill dat painter peast?"
"Ile killed it alone, singlehanded, with his
knife, after he had wounded it with his rifle !"
said the old Indian, and his keen black-eyes
washed with pride and satisfaction, as he gazed
after the young man, who proceeded to the
brook to wa-h away the stains of his battle,
while lion Yost stretched out and examined
the huge skin of the panther.
Dunder, vot a pig painte'!" exclaimed the
German. "1 tell you vot, grandad, dat poy
is pound to pe a great man von of dese days!"
"Yes ; lie will be a great chief!" replied
the ohl Indian. "I shall see that, and then I
shall die! I can go, then, to the happy
hunting-grounds above, in peace !"

brook, now returned, and the old Indian made
him accept of a new suit of elegantly-worked
hunting clothes, bidding him say at the Hall
that they were a present from lion Yost,
whom ie had met in the forest,
"May I come to see you again ?" asked the
young ndian, after he had exchanged his old
clothes for the new.
"Yes, if you come alone! And keep my
words ; for no one beside you and IIon Yost
must know that I am here ! Come, and I will
tell you of the deeds of your fathers-tell you
of the brave works of your race, and show
you how to tread the path before you !"
"I will come !" said the young Indian, and
he took up the panther-skin and his rifle, and
went away.
CIIAPTER XXVI.
Another wild, wide bound over the desert
of Time, with its wrecks and sleepy years,
lay behind us ; for in them there is nothing
that claims more than a passing glance at our
hands.
And what a change those years have
wrought among our characters! In, stature,
as in age, Thayendanegea has become roan--
in deed and fame, a warrior. lhe beard has
stolen out upon the face of John Johnson, and
the careless laugh of the boy has given place
to the stern demeanor of the man.    Guy
Johnson, still mean. envious, full of treachery
and guile, progresses with the rest along
Time's pathway. lHe yet remains beneath the
roof of Sir William, whose white hairs, nore
than any bodily infirmity, tell, too, that heis
growing older.  And Mr. O'Whaekem    still
lives, the birchifying terror of the rising
generation, and the "oracle" of the' neigh-
borhood The ltdies-I mean the young
ones-have "spread'" considerably, not ihoopa-
tively; but a truce to all of this re-descriptive-
ness. Imagine every one of my characters
five or six years ahead of where we left them

human progression goes you have them ready

It was spring, leafy, balmy June, in 1774.
And those who now dwell in the valley of the
Mohawk can tell you how bright and beauti-
ful, how very pleasant is that month there
after the long, cold winter has passed utterly
away, and the late spring frosts peculiar to
the region have vanished, and the young,
green leaves and the bright flowers have
come to life--to life and beauty.
It was a night for love, for the stars were
looking from a cloudless sky, and the new
moon showed its silvery crescent among
them.
And there was love-making, or wooing,
going on at that time in the vicinity of

S\Where is your heart, Thinendanegea ?"
asked  Kathleen, as they   walked through
the grove.
"troing within my breast, like the heart
of the oak !'' wais his reply.
" Arid will love never enter it?" she asked.
"Love is for women to talk about !" was
his answer. " A warrior, whose eye is upon
the war-path, hafs oilier things to think of."
" But there is no war now ! Why should
you ie forever thinking of that?"
"Because it will come, and soon.  Your
father says so, and truth is on his lips, lie
never spoke to me with a forked tongue !"
" Well, it will come, and soon pass awny,

"how wrong and how cruel to ay that!"
Tears stole out fror her blue eyesrand down.
her fair cheeks, as she added :  If I weep at
the thought, how  much the   onre will I
weep at the fact, should it ever occur. And
Dvagetto, your giod mother, ai   Onalova.
your sister, will grieve all as much, I ari
sure!"
"The mother and sister of a Mohawk will
never weep for his death, in battle, if his face
is turned toward the foe !" hereplied, as they
passed from the grove toward the house,
" Will Onalova be my bride !" said John
Johnson to the Indian gir. as he passed his
arm  around her waist, while they walked
through the shadowy grove.
Onalova has given her heart to you. She
will never change while water iliws down the
hill-side, or the trees grow !'' replied the girl.
"Iiut while my fa lier lives he will refuse
to let the heir to his title marry the daughter
of the Mohawk."
"TIe is a fool, then, for the child of the red
man is as good as the sdn of the ale face. I
it is not so, why do you say that you love
me ?"
"You are as good, my proud girl. lie vill
look higher for me !"
If he looks too high, he will not see the
path that he walks upon, and fll !" said the
girl, proudly.
"That is true ; but Onalova can be my
lbrile in secret, without his knowledge, and
when lie lasss to the spirit-land, I can tell
all the world lhat she is mine !"
TThe girl looked at hu ket nly and hesitated
to reply. He noticed this and said
"if iOnalova's heart is mine she will not
pause to answer
"THer heart is yours, and she will not fear
to trust you !" said the trusting girl, and,
thouglg  colder in her nature, prhaps, na most
of her race, than the pale-faces, sire did not
turn from his kisses, nor fear to listen to his
plain for their secret marriage.
And at that very hour Guy Johnson had
succeeded in gaining a reluctant consent from
Leonore to take a similar step.
CHAPTER XXVII.
Old Aroghryadecka paced to and fro, with a
lowerig brow, in the sitting-room  of Sir
Wilflan Johnson. Ihis fiery eve never had
gleamed more fiercely on the battle-field than
it did then and there, and every quivering
muscle showed the agitat ion of his mind-
that there was a tempest in his breast. But,
canrr and imp'rturballe as ever, Sir William
sat with a package of dispatches before him,

TUE WAR-EAGLE (
which he had 3ust, received from Boston, an-
pouncing the nil-important fact that hostilities
had actually broken out between the colonists
and the English government ; that a revolu-
tion. likely to be long and bloody, had com-
inenced. As a titled officer of King George,
from whom lie had received many a favor,
besides the lucrative post which he held, of
course there was but one side which he could
be expected to take in the coming struggle.
And having so large a body of tenantry under
his control, mostly Scotch and Irish, whom he
had himself imported and placed upon his
domains, and also a sere control of all the
Indians except Oneida's, between him  and
Canada, in which province lie also had great
influence, his services were at once called for,
not only to crush rebellion, as it was termed,
should it rise in the thickly-settled valley of
the Mohawk, but also to organize and excite
the Indians to take part in the merciless var-
fare so soon to be commenced in that section,
down the valley of the hudson, and in the
region of the Delaware and Schoharie.
And these were the instructions which ac-
conipanied the dispatches, telling of patriot
and British blood having been already shied
at Boston, of the determination of the king
and his servants to crush the rebellion at all
hazards and at all costs. And old as he was,
leternminel to take the field in person, for the
safety of his immense possessions depended
on his beating back the patriots, whom lie
knew, led on by a Herkimer and a Willet,
would not long be idle when the war-cry was
raised in the valley.
The cause of the anger of the old Mohawk
chief ennr better be discovered by the words
of their conversation, than in any other way.
" Vhy must I, who have led my people to
battle so often, be made to yield to that boy,
whose flce is like that of a squaw?" he asked,
at last.
"For three reasons," replied Sir William.
"First, it is his right, too long delayed. ;Next,
he is a brave warrior, young as lie is, and
though his rights are yet unknown to him or
his tribe, no man so popular there as he.
Lastly, it is my will! You are old-need rest
rather than to travel on the war-path 1"
"The great chief has counted as niany sum-
mers as I have, and the snows of as many
Winters are upon his hairs !" said the oho
thief, not so angrily as whenlie asked his
question, for, knowingas he did that the baro-
miet. was iii no humor to be trified with, he
deemed caution to be his best policy.
"'True, but I have a son and a nephew,
rep"d as soldiers, -to .lead ny:-warriors to
battle, and Thayendanegea mst and shall
kad the M11 ohawks-nae, and the Six Nations,
if I witl it! None of the chiief of the Sene-
ens,' or Uiontdagos, or Cayugasiwil offer, like
)ou, to oppose-rmy will !"
" The great chief has spoken, and Aroghya-

)F THE MOUAW      S,             '     51
decka will now be silet.t, Let the will of my
brother be done," said the wily ehief, bat
there was treachery in hije look as he
spoke.  "I will call a -eouncil, and myself
name Thayendanegea as my successor, for I
anm old, and, like a rotten tree, scarce fit to be
cut down, but ready to fall with the firs
blast that comes. It is winter with me-I
will fold my arms, and sit down in my wig-
warn to die, while the young braves follow
the path I first led them on !"
The sad tone of the old Indian, more than
aught else, led the old baronet to believe in
his sincerity. And there was a tone of sym-
pathy in his voice, and a look of pity in his
face, as he said :
"Let Aroghyadecka be cheerful--he retires
to rest, and live in comfort now. lie shat)
never lack for food or blankets while I or my
children live.  And when his braves come
back to dance the scalp-dance, his 'will be the
seat of honor at the council-fire, for they will
,remember his great deeds when he waa young,
and we fought the French side by side, and
will make his heart glad with their praises!"
And then he went to get brandy himself, for
he had reasons for wishing to have this inter-
view uninterrupted, even by a servant, for he
knew the vital importance of keeping the
news utterly secret which he had received,
Iad he seen the wily and devilish look
of hatred which followed him from the eli
Indian's eyes, he would have been more upon
his guard, and had lie seen the old villain
take from his pouch some of the deadly bee-
ries of the ground-hemlock, and squeeze theris
into the goblet of silver from which the old
general always drank, his life would have been
longer spared, and his death less shrouded in
mystery than it was.     a
Scarce had Aroghyadecka, with a skill
which would have made him immortal in the
days of Lucretia Borgia, paced the deadliest
portion known to the aborigines of the Nortl
in the goblet, when Sir William returned, and
pouring out a glass of liquor for the Mohawk,
also put a hearty draught in his own goblet,
and raising it to his lips, said :
"We will drink to King George and oii
future friendship, Aroghyadecka, and then
we will smoke a peaee-pipe together, as we
have often done before, and sweep away alb
clouds from between us."
ie drank, and almost upon the instant b
gan to feel the effects of the poison.
"Dog! you have slain me" he gasped, a
he strove to reach the door.
"You first, Thayendanegea next !" said'the
Â°old murderer, as be pushed the already tot.
tering baronet back in his, chair, where he
gasped for only a few moments, and then
stiffened in death.
. Then hastening away, he met Guy Johnson
first, to whom lie said :

THE WAR-EAGLE OF TILE MOHAWKS.

A gleam of pleasure, rather than of pain,
shot from the eyes of the hieart!ess nephew,,
when he heard ius news, but le could not
avoil alarming the family, and himself has-
-tning to the baronet's room.
All was now excitement .and mourning
through the mansion, and all the settlement.
'Weeping 'and wailing was seen and beard
'               Iupon every hand, for, as a master and a
friend, as a husband and a father, no one was
*ver more loved than he.
The physician, who had so long known
every symptom of his ailings, and every fault
of hise anstitution, decided that the baronet
had d.ed of apoplexy, for lie knew nothing of'
the nature of the poison which he had taken,
sid the ap pearance of the deceased was such
is left by an apoplectic fit. None, for a
moment, thought how he had perished, for
he had been in usual health until a few mo-
ments of the time when lie perished.
Johni, who at once became a baronet, as the
ntly son ind nearest heir of his either, though
-                 convulsed with grief-tfr lie was an affection-
ate son, no matter what his other faults were-
at once took possession of his papers, and his
last diepatches, and secured them, for he saw
their importance,
AAmong the many who hurried to the room
where the corpse laid, was our old friend, Hon
Yost Sc/ yler.
iHe had ever an idle way of peering about,
and searching into things whieb dl not much
concern him, aund upon this occasion he took
ttp the goblet from which the poisoned draught
-                had been swallowed, and smelled its contents,
if any there were in it, perchance to see if
there wagany of his favorite beverage, liquor,
left in it.
The moment that lie did so, lie started,
tun"e pie, and set the goblet down.
" Duiler and blixen, I wonder if der oit
man is a pigger fool dan me, and has  iade
himself avay mit a suicideP l' e muttered, in
a low tone, unheard by those who were
weeping around, and then he went and smell-
ed of the other glass, which still contained
some liquor, and this he did not set down
with such haste and tremor as the other.
And as now, Aroghyadecka was telling his
tale, which was that the late baronet had sent
a runner to him to bid him epme and see
*.               him, that lie did so, and, while talking, Sir
Wtlliam sudilenly fell back in his chair in a
dying state-lon Yost listened to the story
with a 1 atttention.
A'ain he shook his head, as lie stood back
betn the rest, and muttered to himiself

Okd Mohawk know all apout dat poison.

Neither his words or actions were over-

heard or noticed, for the company in th, room
were too much engaged in looking upon the
corpse, and hearing the narration of the only
witness to the baronet's illness.
/
CIIAPTER   XXVIIT.
It was a few hours later, and nght had
spread its cloak of darkness over the earth.
The Mohawk chief, lat f drunk with liquor,
obtained from  Mr. O'Whackem   and others,
wol) had wished to hear his tale of the bare.
net's sudden iilliens and doith, was reeling
along toward his village, when he suddenly
came upon a camp by the side of the trail r
path, and saw lion Yost sitting by the fire,
smoking as usual, for it w as indeed unusual
to see him without that appendage t here.
"hallo, olt Tuyvethug, stop hero a minute
or two !c ried Ilon Yost, as he saw Aroghy.

like you did nmt Uncle Sir l'til to-daiy .!I

Drunk as the old Indian was, tihe i a ting
words of the Dutchman seemed to sober hin
in an instant.
" What does my pale-faced brother mean?"
he said, first pausing a moment, and then ad-
vancing slowly toward the fire.
Yust vot I says-I toi't put cround-hem.

said the Dutchman, and, as if to prove liii
words, he raised a bottle to his lips and drank
of its contents.
"What does my brother' know of hem-
lock ?' asked the \vilv Indian, approaching
still closer to ion Yost.
4 Dat it kills in less time dan  onu can cut

"You'll never say so much to other earl
dog of a pale-face e" cried the Indian, nd at
a bound lie sprang upon11lon Yost with his
hatchet raised for a death-blow.
But the Dutchman was .-too much used
to Indians and their ways to, be entirely
unprepared for the assault, skkn as it wias,
Stooping suddenly, albnost to the ground
he evaded the blow of the hatchet, and catch-
ing hini by thte egs, fairly toppled him ovrr,
anal pitched him headlong into tihe fire. With
a wild yell of race as well as ptin, the No-
hawk sprung through the bbize, nud scai
about to -renew struggle, whIjc he knitt
would be of-death to one .or the other-_iuid
he feared tth divulging of tie 'secret gaied
byH a re'Y  more than he did death, for t
shameful death he knew it voenidmrie
him. Au Indian -would sooner' endue a$IUj

totare than perish by the gallows--for it
tes a belief with every tribe which I have
known, that the spirit of an Indian who has
been hanged, can never enter the happy hunt-
in-.rounds above-their heaven-but must
wander forevermore in a place of woe and
darkness. And well it were if whites thought
the same-they would be more careful how
th  deserved hanging.
uInt ILion Yost had reached his rifle before
the Indian could make his second leap, and,
with it cocked and full-levelled at the breast
of the miaddened chief, he cried
"If ever you pray, you, olt heathen tog,
do it quick now, for a tead Isijun I'll make
mit yomu ymst so sure as I live!I"
A roshydecka hesitated  moment, but the
fire of desperation was in his eye, and he 
would have bounded forward to- meet his
death-for the aim of ion Yost never failed--
but at this moment the white-haired and
mysterious Indian, whom we have seen so
few times, stepped from the dark gloom of
the wood. 'within the circle of fire-light right
between lion Yost and his- intended victim.
Ugh! Ogahtee's spirit comes to curse
me!" veied Aroghvadecka, wildly,and drop.
ping his uplifted H~atehet, hie turned and feed
madly awvuyinito the woods.
" Cot il 'htirnunel, you spoiled the best shot
I could have made dis ten years !" growled
Ilon Yost, as lie lowered tis gun, sulkily.
and took up his bottle from the ground,
only to find tiat its contents hnd been lasted
in the struggle, because the cork wvas omit

one comfort was loft to him. "Vy for you
not let tme shoot dat Tuyvelpug Injun ?" lie
continued.
"his time has not come, and it is not by
your hand that he must die !" said Ogahtee,
'quietly.
" VA, den, de Tuyvelbug shall hang, for I

"No; the Great Spirit has given him to
me. For many a weary moon-niany a long
year--I have suffered at his hands. For him
my wife and chikren were sent far from me
toward the sunset, and lie must fall by my
hand. It was as well, too, that the iale-aticed
chief died at his hands, for both were linked
in the treachery which made my hairs white
as winter's snow, while yet Iwas young and
strong as the oak. For a squatv I was sold
from sunlight to darkness-a warrior killed to
make my tribe think I was slain, and those I

Tetwo now parted, the one going toward
Johnson IHall, the other toward the Mohawk
village, both following the trail even in the
darkness, with that certainty which only long
practice in the forest can give to man.
CHAPTER XXIX.
Within a lodge, which bore the signs ofthe
smoke and the weather of many season ;sat
Dyagetto, the noble mother of Thayenda-
negea-sat there alone, working upon some
of the choice and beautiful embroidery peon-
liar to her nation-probably upon sote gaw-
ment or ornament for her beloved chdldreA,
for never mother loved children with deeper
love than she. And why. one would ask, did
She prefer thus jto dwell so far away from
them in that hone lodge?
For two reasons, and both compatible ith
the natural, proud nobility, and the unciAng
itig faithfuntess of her character.
First, though'for'the sake of the care and
advancement of her children, she was willing
that tey should dwell beneath the roof of
Jotinstn hatt, for herselfahie would acept no"
favor at. the Inainds-of the lordly and wealthy

owner ; for she knew but too well what he har
done to gain the loveliest maiden of the Mo
hawk trite, whom lier fatter, Aroghtyadeeka
would part with upon no terms, as she had
been led to believe, but the death of her
loved hiusbiand, and the perpetual banishment
of herself and ebildren ; while he, bold ani
wily villain that lie was, was, through Sii
William's boundless influence, raised to the
position of chief-of the Mohawks, which, by
right of hterittige, as well as valor, belonged
to the nolie-Ogahtee, her husband. Broken-
hearted, and too proud to bear her shame, the
bartered maiden-Aroghyadecka's daughter-
died; and then the baronet felt keenly the
price of his wrong to Ogahtee, supposing, as
al diii, that the brave chief had fallen by the
hand of an assassin-for a body, clad in his
jrnents, but unrecognizably mutilated, had
en found and buried as Ogahtee, with all
se honors of his tribe, in their ancient burial
und. But as we have seen, it was not he,
but one who, belonging to another tribe, and
having disappeared suddenly, was supposed
to have been the assassin who had done the
base deed, while, by the merciless cruelty of
Aroghyadecka, Ogahtee was buried in the
deep recesses of a cave, wherefrom no egress
could be bad, save by help from  without,
there to hear the taunts of his fiendish
enemy, who only fed him that he might live
and suffer.
Thesecond reason why Dyagetto dwelt there
alone was, that the lodge where first she had
dwelt as a happy bride, was near Ogahtee's
grave, or the grave where she thought he
y, and to it she could make her daily pit-
grinages, an'd upor out a sorrow which,
with her, could know no end-a sorrow for
the loss of her first and only love.
Is there a heroism of love?   Ah! more
0 aree than angels' visits now, is it ! These
Cristian women, or many of them, who laugh
or shudder at the terrible fidelity-for it should
know no other name-which causes the Hin-
o. widow voluntarily to mingle her ashes
with those of her dead husband, upon his
funeral pyre, rather than survive him-will
themselves weep over the tomb of a husband
for a few days, and then, forgetting all past
love and sacred vows, seek and win and take
another to their widowed breasts-east off
their mourning weeds of mockery, and be
smiling brides again. Is not this true?
And how few do we see in this heartless,
modern world. which I so much despise, who
will, like Dyagetto, love and mourn their
d through a long, dark life-time-how
w.Z few?
ain I asy that the heroism of love, in
kart. which despise the heathen, is more
Narce than honesty in Wall street, or patriot-
ism in a politician-two things utterly un-
known, ana out of data.
But back, wild, wandering mind, back from

d  the field of reflective truth to th' pathway of
my story.
Dyagetto sat there alone, a quiet. sorrow
I resting upon her noble face, like a shadow
r upon an unrufefld hake. But. a tootStepc near
t her door aroused her from her pensive at',
- 'tude, and she listened. as if fear of annova
r was in her breast, and pushed back the .n.
dian lamp of fish oil, which had s:it upon the
table before her, and shadowed it with her
hand.
" Is it that accursed Aroghyadecka, who
comes again to torment me, -s he threatened,
. or the good Spirits of the Night, who so long
have brought the widow food, though she
was forbidden to look upon then ?" she said,
She paused and listened, for the footsteps
had ceased, and all was for a moment still.
Then a voice, low and gentle, like one which
she had heard in tones of love, longz years be.
fore-and who can e'er forget that voice of
lore ?-eame softly uponl her ear, from the
front of the lodge.
"Can Dyagetto make her heart brave, so
that she catn look upon the Spirit of the Night,
and feel no fear?"
For a moment the woman trembled and
paused, for brave, indeed, were she, who
could be calm in such circumstances. Then
gathering back her brave thoughts, site re.
plied;,
" Dyagetto will pray to the Great Spirik
and then her heart will know no fear."
And for a moment her heart looked up to
God, and asked for strength ; and who will say
that He would be deaf to such a "heathen s"
prayer?
Then she said calmly, and without fear
" The heart of Dyagetto is clean, her eves
are open, and she is not afraid to gaze upon
the Spirit of the.Night !"
" Even if it comes in the shape of the lost
Ogahtee?" continued a voice.
"More glad were Dyagetto to see the shape
of her lost Ogahtee thatn to look upon tall
the glories of the happy hunting-ground !"
Softly the door opened, and the white.
haired Indian-the fdlher of her children, the
husband of her louth-stood before heer. his
tall frame quivering with a life-emotion too
powerful for other utterance.
Oh, how piercing are the eyes of true love 1
No bandaged Cupid let me see ! Love is
not blind ! Though sorrow and suffering
had bleached the hair she last had looked
upon when jetty was its hue-though the
once smooth brow was now furrowed by many
a deep line of care and woe, and though the
manly forr, was wasted by long suffering,
her eye, like her heart, could not be deceived,
and she bounded with a wild cry to his arms,
even as a lost child would l-ap to meet t
motlhr, and cried
"it is Ogabtee's self! blest Spini of the
Night I"

And for a time no sound was heard, save
the beating of two hearts, one against the
other, and the heavy breathing from lips which
could not speak.
Then tears came from the heavenly portals
of joy, then low words of gladness were heard,
and a tale of suffering and woe, on either
part, was told, so mingled with the happi-
ness of the present that it hardly could seem
sad, even like the shower that comes when
the sun is shining.
"have you seen our noble Thayendanegea?"
asked Dyagetto, after the first explanations
were over.
"My eyes have watched over hirn for many
moons, even as the eagle looks eldsely after
its young t" replied Ogabtee.  "And," he
added, "lhe is fit to rule the Mohawks now,
and lead them on to battle, And to-morrow,
when Aroghya-deeka goes down to darkness,
black as his own heart, Thayendanegea shall
stand before them as their chief. But to him
we now must go, for he must know his father.
The time has come."       /
Bearing with her an embroidered belt and
huntin-shirt, which she had made for him,
Dyagetto hastened with her husband to meet
aer son. All was yet night without; but there
was no darkness within the hearts of those
who went forth in it-all was light there.
Not many minutes had the old lodge been
 empty, before the stealthy steps of two persons
approached, and soon the forms of two of our
cliaracters made their appearance at the door,
which in love's forgetfulness had been left
open, as well as the light burning by Ogahtee
and his wife, when they went out.
First the hateful face of Aroghyadecka, none
the more improved by the fiery ordeal through
which ion Yost had so lately passed him,
peered in through the open'door, and then
over his slulder looked the scarred visige of
his son Ipisico, of whom we have lost sight for
a long time, but who had in some way regain-
ed his father's favor, perebance for his very
ugliness and natural deviltry.
"She is not there ; she has heard our steps,
and fled like the frightened doe from its nest,
when it hears the hunter conic " said the old
Indian.
"If we hide, she will come back to her
nest," said the son.
"We cannot wait. We -must be ready for
the council, to-morrow ; for soon our warriors
must tread the war-path'!" replied Aroghva-
decka and he turned away, followed by Ipisieo
CHAPTER XXX.
"Well, we are here. Where is he who sent
for me ?" said Thayendanegea, impatiently,
jat at.the day's dawn, as he stood with lion
ost before the lodge in the ravine, where
Ogahtee had dwelt so long.

"lIe said he vould he here mit de daylight.
und he always speaks for true l' replied IHoa
Yost.
"Yes-my tongue is not forked-I am
here !" said Oaahtee, as he stepped fromnthe
lodge, with Dyagetto by his side, his aria
upon her neck, and her's around his waist.
And nobly now did he look, for he wore the
rich garb of a chief, and a loftv look of joy and
pride, such as Tlhavendanegea tad never seen
him wear before, though often the young in.
dan had sought him there to hear words of
advising wisdom from his lips, little knowing
'who it' was that spoke them.
- The young Indian looked at both and their
position with suspicious astoniisnment; but
did not speak, for he knew not what to say or
ask.
"Does Thayendanegea remember-the land of
the Minmis ?" asked Dyagetto.
"lie has not forgotten the dogs that live to-
ward the setting sun 1" repliedl Thayendane-
gea.
"And does he remember that there his
mother promised that the time 'should come
when he should know who his brave father
was?"
" Thayendanegea remembers that we came
to seek his grave !"
"That grave had not been filled I Behold
Ogabtee, the true chief of the Mohawks, and
yoeir fi/ther !" cried the proud mother
"ANy mind is dark-make it more light,"
said Thayendanegea, still with distrust,
And then to him the tale of worider was
told, so strange and yet so true, and be learn-
ed for the first time who and what lie was, and
why he: had been so much inclined to ever.
ence the white-hAired man, whom now he
knew as father. and embraced with the flial
love of a son. Hard were it to describe the
feelings of those so long separated, but now
united, to part only when death should send
his messenger unto them.
It is only just to say, that Hon Yost danced
a Dutch hornpipe for very glee, broke his
"smoke-pipe," aid kicked over and shattered
his beloved "prandy pottle." in honor of the
occasion, and never grumbled at his'loss.
Bt while this was going on as a "solo" upon
his part, or rather as a "voluntary," Ogahitee
and his spn were arranging their plan for pre-
senting themselves -before the Council 'of the
Mohawks, which they knew hail beenordered
to assemble on that day.
What those plans were, another chapter and
their result must show.

as republics, and first among the known na-
tions in art and civiliation--of the wisdom of
those old senators who listened to a Demos-
-nben, and a Cicero, in grave silence, and
dosght of what they heard, than the sight of
an Indian council in full assemblage, upon an
" -        irnplortaRntoccasion.
i I have een present at more than- one, and
as I saw them seated around their coneil fire,
the oldest w rriors and the chiefs within, and
the younger braves without the circle, first in
solemn silence passing around the pipe which
als mst. whiff, and then in a quiet, still as the
_k         tomb, listing to each warrior who rose in
turn to speak, I have contrasted the scene
with the noisy debates, the lack of dignity,
Lid respect each for the other exhibited by
: ,our senators and representatives, whiel "I
have witnessed m our national councils at
Washington, and felt, that the savages were
by tar the most respectable in their demeanor
The Mohawks were in eonnci   their fire
lighted in the huge wigwam devoted to that
purpose ; the sentinels posted like tylers with-
out, to keep back any curious listener or
eavesdropper who might approach the sacred
building ;for no Christian holds his church
more sacred--nay, apparently not half soinuch
so-ina the red men do their council house;.
The pipe of friendship had passed from lip
to lip, aol all was still but the slight crack-
lhng of the tire that formed the centre of the
circle.
Aroghyadeeka arose, his crimes as yet all
unknown to his tribe, and while he held a
black belt in his hand, he spoke
SBrothers: it is already known to you. that
the great ehief of the pale-faces--our father,
fir William J4hnson-has gone up to the land
of spirits. Ilis children are crying. And we
weep with them   Their hearts are under a
eloud--its shadow also rests upon us. But an-
other chief will fill his plnce as our friend, from
the Great Father, King George, beyond the
big salt waters !"
e Is paused a moment, and taking a red
.belt from his nearest attendant, Ipisico, con-
tinned :
"Yet while our hearts are sorrowful for the
loss of our great friend, I have news to tell
that will make you glid. Before he passed
away, lie bade me cal ltlsis council, and to tell
you that lie wished you to sharpen your
knives and hatchets, and to be ready to tread
the war-path.   The men of Boston have
Sbrkse. faith with their Great Father, and
many more pale-faces through the land mean
to do the same. Our Great Father has dug
up the hatchet to punish them. He calls upon
his red children, the Mohawks, to help him do
tids work. lie will give us many guns, much
powder and land, and fire-water, and feed our
wives nud children, while we are far away
- a his war-path. I told our friend and
father that for myse  I was a friend to Iiug
'  ,        George. I wo      gup the hathet, paint

my face. and fight for hin  1'om you ;t is
to say-wilt you go where Aroglhvidieka
leads ?"
A murmur of approval followed ; then all
was still, and Thayendnegea, the most popu-
lar of all the younger braves, arose and said
Brothers and fathers ! I have not lived
so manry winters as inay of you, but I know
that your ears will be open to my words, and
I will speak. Brothers ! I am glad that the
hatchet is to be dug np and that we are again
to walk View ar-path, for I am tired of doing
'notlhing.n My heart is hungry for action.
But I ni;.st tell you a story brought to me by
a bird. It is about a brave chief who loved
his people and was beloved by thema-for he
was first upon the war-path, and his wigwam
was ever open to the hungry and the naked.
But there was a snake in his tribe. And he
wound himself around the neck of the brave
chief, and dragged himt away to a cave, and
hid him, and his people mourned for him as
dead I And the snake, who worked in the
dark, and was more cunning than the fox,
came out among the people, and made him-
self great.
"Brother, I am ready to tread with you the
war-path, but first behold the snake, and look
upon mry father, Ogahtee, your rightful and
long-lost chief!"
And as the young brave uttered these
words, he pointed with1 one hand at'Aroghya'
decka, and with the other at his father, who,
at that moment, walked into the council-house,
clad in the most regal of savage garbs.
In an instant Aroghyaleeka sprung to his
feet with a look of defiance on his face, but
when his eye met that of Ogabtee, he sunk
down to the ground again, and, while he utter-
ed amlow groan, he drew hris blanket over liii
head,* for he knew that he was in !-tIe In.
dians had recognised their chief.
And then and there was seen that stoie and
sage-like gravity, of which I spoke at thie
opening of this chapter. The whole circle
knew their chief, but remained silent for him
to tell his story, and make the explanation,
which they knew he would give.
He advanced within the circle, and in quiet
dignity told all, even to the poisoning of Sir
Williamir Johnson, by the traitor, who cowered
in their midst.-
When he was done, an aged warrior arose
and said
"Brother, Father, and Chief! ewe welcome
you as one who has come back from the api-
nit-land to 'is ! Our hearts, which long bled
for your loss, are made whole again I We
will make a feast, and our people will all re-
joice. Aid w en the hatchet is dug up, none
but Ogahtee shluil lead the Mohawks on the
war-path! I have spoken !"
* 'when an Indian's crime, meriting death, _is dig'
covered by ris brethren, ie is never or scarcely ev
known to try to escape, but covering hia heat In dn
pair from view, suienl awaits his trial a1 bladoe

Ogah  , who had sat down, rose to his feet
again and said
'"My ears were open to my brother's words !
But I mi old and my limbs are stiff, though
my heart is warm and strong for my people.
Thayendamriegea is amy only son. Yiou know
that he is brave. Let hiimlead the Mohawks
to the field. I have done "
A single word, and that of approval from
all the council, except. Ipisico and his doomed
father, told how well the proposition was re-
ceived. Thnvendanegea was their leader
Anot her warrior now arose and demanded
that the "snake" should be sentenced to his
deserved doom. But Ogahtee rose and said:
Brothers, it is not for us to defile our
hands with his blood, lie has murdered a
pale-face, let him meet his trial and his doom
at their hands. Send him to the great castle,
aid there let him te given up to those whom
ie last wrnged. . For myself I forgive hin--
I cannot trend upon a fallen foe !"
Ai-olvadecka moaned in agony when he
heard these words, for he would rather have-
had every hatchet there used in chopping him
limb from limb than meet the fate which nhe
knew would he in store for him wien bis
treachc(ry was knowth at Johnson iall.
A  guard of young braves instantly aroseI
and bore the wretched criminal away, while
his shamed son slunk away from the'council.
Then, with all formuality, the pipe was once
more passed around and the council-fire put
out.
The council was over, and could not again
be called but by order of the chief. Then,
for the first time, glad shouts rent the air--
gins were fired amnd a feast was quickly pre-
lamed to show how gladly the Mohawks wei-
comed Ogalitee bacJ--how they could best
do hini iono'.
CIIAPTER XXXII.
Slowly and saly the funeral cortege which
lad huried all that was mortal of Sir Wil-
liam Johnsoni was returning to the hall. And
at the same time, more rapidly, a large body
of gailti-dressed Indians were approachinrg
from the direction of the Mohawk village.
Proudly, upon his coal-black steed, yet as
fiery as when he first bestrode it, yet as all-
obedient, rode Tlhayendannegea at their head,
and hv his side, on either hand, rode Ogahtee
and his noble mother, Dvagetto. And back
in the centre, close boumid amid guarded, was
Aroghryadecka, nolv so far back into the In-
dian nood that slowed neither fear or contri-
tion, but glared hatred and defiance upon -all
around hun-
The Indians moved more slowly as the sad
array of mourners met their view, arnd it was
not until mll Of the females had passed into
the l.all, that Thayendanegen rode .up to the
porch where Sir John Johnson and others,

males, of the household waited to know the
m wining of this visitation.,
Why were you, of all the rest, away from
t re funeral of my father, to whom you surely
owed sonic duty ind respect ?" said Sir John,
wit i stern sadness, to Tiharveridanegea.
. I owed a duty and respect to my ow
father. Ogahteethe Chief of the Mkewks !"
Stil TIayendaniegea, proudly. as he pmuiited to
his nohte-looking father. " An a datij I have
done to you and yotfr fathers meniory, for I
bring his murderer here for au to deal with!"
lls murderer--my fatherasnnrdered!" cried
Sir John. as he hookernt Arighvadeccka, who
hiad been brought forward at a ,sign from\
Thavendrnergea
"Yes, I'kiiled him ;re would haverobbed
me ofimy rights-I have lost nll now ; kill re
if yon are not a coward !" cried Aroghva-s
decka, who hoped, by exciting an instat re-
venge, yet to escape the doom he most dread-
ed !"'                i
Madness-he was not slain, no mark of
violence was upon him!t" eried Sir John.
"Indian poison leaves no mark !" said the
old Mohawk, With a sardonic smile.
Who else can prove this, for sure!y the
masn must he insane to thus counuit himself
to a deed for which he shall hang so sure as it
is truet"
"Me--ion Yost--knows dat he did it, Sir
Yohrn Yohuson," cried our old Dutch friend,
pushing through the crowd which had gath,
ered near. "i shmelt der erounrd-hemilrek in
der silver bowl vot your fader drink his

cried Sir John, now reddlenrirng with exeite-
ment, for Ire began to feel iat, indeed, ied his
father perished by meniis= most base and aun-

Then he bade- Thayendaneger arid iris friend.

in the grove back of Johnson 11,1 ia f ur dif-

ment of the armed Highlanders under Me-
Donald, in which the late baronet had taken
such delight, and their stern visages and re-
vengeful eves boded no good will to the con-
demned prisoner, who stood upon its platform
above their bayonets, ready to meet the fate
to which he had been sentenced by stern and
relentless judges.
Around, also, as close as they could get,
were the ninnytenants and retainers of the
estate, prominent amongst whom were our
friends Daly-not the Patrick-but the doctor,
secretary Lafferty, Mr. O'Whackem, etc. But
not a single Indian was in view .It was a
sight which thfel more than all men on earth
dread to see.
Upon the scaffold beside Arozhyadecka
Stood lion Yost, for he had asked the privi-
lege of ianing "Old Tuyvelbug," to whom
he had always felt an antipathy, but increased
by the Indian's late attenipt upon his life.
The rope was already around the Indian's
neck, and but a touch of the tipping board,
which served for a drop, was required to
"launch him into eternity," as the reporters
say.  But, by the looks occasionally cast
around, it would seem  that Same one was
waited for before the execution could be con-
eluded.
Many were the remarks made by the by-
standers, but not one which exlitoited any
feeling for the criminal, who stood like a
bronze statue of defiant hate-a scowl upon
his brow, a flashing pair of eyes, lips close
drawn, and a form more firm than the stout
post by his side.
Faith, it's a stiff dance he'll make when
he threads upon nothin'!" said Lafferty to
O'Whackem. "There's never a quiver to lip,
leg, or eye-lash !"
"It's because we haven't any music for
him, poor dog, If we had, he might give us
$ semi-gainer at any rate !"
OcI, boys, lie's no subject to be joking
at I" said Doctor Daly.
"Be asy now, doctor clear, an' jist think
what you said at dinner 1" cried the school-
master. "You were sayin' what a capital
subject, he'd make for di section. Oeh, it's
yourself will be cutting worse jokes on him
directly, I'm a thinkin'!"
This battle of words was now cut short by
the appearance of those by whom he had
been tried, who, with Sir John Johnson
among them, approached, according to custom,
to see their sentence executed.
Now all was silence in the crowd ; for they
felt what all must feel, no matter how vile the
criminal, an inward thrill of horror at the
approach of the very moment when a human
being is to be coolly cast from life into the
jaws of death, before theii- very eyes. Men,
who glory in the sanguinary excitement of
the battle-field, will shudder at such a mo-
mnent.
At this distance, when the signal was about

to be given, the prisone, whose hands haa
apparent'v been securely I on nd, raised both
hands, whie. iii some way he had slipped
from the cords which bound them, and, with
the gickness of thought, slipped the noose
from his neck, while Hon Yost stood aghast,
and, with a wild yell of triumph, cast himself
upon the tripple hedge of lifted bayonets
below, meeting an almost instant death, and
at last escaping the doom which lie niost
dreaded !
"Dnder! Mine Cot, vot a yump !" cried
lon Yost, as he bent over the scafloldI, and
looked upon the quivering body which the
blood-hespotted soldiers were trying to disen-
gage fLoin their bayonets.
'The crowd uttered a groan of disappoint-
mnent and turned awav; for tler knew that all
was over with the poisoner of Sir William
Johnson.
"What d'ye think o' your subject now, doc-
tor dear ?" asked O'Whaekem, as lie and his
friends started homeward.
"'T'hat he's like yourself, O'Whackem--a
divilish had subject, and not worth the cut
tin' up! " replied the doctor.
"I'll he a subject if you'll stand trate, doe-
tor !" said Lafferty.
"I'm your man for that, my boy ; but what
kind of a subject will you be !"
"Faith, a dry one, ould saw-bones !"
Thus joking, as the sons of Erin ever are,
whether it be at a funeral or elsewhere, our
friends " professional" passed on. and all was
still and quiet, where the mangled body of
Aroghryadeeka lay, for no one had touched it
after the bayonets were withdrawn.
It was an hour later, and gloom seemed to
hang heavy in the sky, for dark arid lowering
clouds were there. And all was still in tie
grove, for no wind stirred the braneles of the
gloomy pines. It seemed as if the spirits of
tire air felt that the spot where the dead mur-
derer lay was accursed, and while they hung
tire heavy pail of gloom far, far above, below
they would not come!
But one cones shuddering amid creeping
through the chill darkness-one who, though
a coward. feared not to seek, perchance, his
last friend upon earth-for the world hold-
back in horror even from the son of a murs
derer-and this was Ipisico, come to weep and
moan above the mangled corpse of his father,
whose brave leap from life to death he had
witnessed from a tree-top, not very far away;
but in which he had lain concealed until 'he
felt certain io one was near tire body
Oh, tell Inc not there is'a heart so bad in
all this wide, wide world, in which there is
not one good drop of blood. Inlrunman, as
ignorant, is the humanity which would utter
it.
Here, in tire gloom of night, we see one of
the worst of our characters-one who is cow-

ardly,,treacherous, malicious, and false-with
enough of filial love to seek his degraded pa-

He finds all that is left of Aroghydtdecka,
hose j'itts forgetting, we can half afford to

wild moan, which speaks like the voice of a
breaking heart.
But, hark ! Quick, loud, and fearfuh another
voice is heard. It is the voice of the storm
which has been gathering in black silence
overhead. The bursting thunder shakes the
earth ! The red lightning leaps along the
sky, stoops down to earth, shattering every-
thing it meets, scattering only when its fiery
work is done.
Aht! see, a red bolt strikes the gallows tree
--down it speeds on him who can feel but
heeds not, on the senseless corpse as well-
and Ipisico is beyond the reach of hate and

CIIAPTER    XXXIII.
Once more, reader, leap with me over a
lapse of time, which, though full of thrilling
incidents, all closely linked with the struggle
cf out' bravo forefathers for freedom, still may
not be embh'raced within the narrow limits of
a novelette, as this only professes to be.
This much I will say: Guy Johnson, after
becoming the king's superintendent of Indian
affairs, through a manoeuvre characteristic of
. Iimsclf-and'you already know him-married
Leoniore public, though she long had been
his wife; and Onalova became the bride of
Sir John Johnson, against the will of Ogahtee
and Dyagetto, who, proud of their blood,
would not that one of their race should link
withia pale face ; and Sir John, having iro-
ken his parole to the American cause, had
been long driven front his immense and fair do-
mains, whieh were confiscated to the patriot
cause, and ie, made a general in the British
eause, haid raised a large body of Canadians
and tries called tire "Johnson Greens," and,
with all the confederacy of the Six Nations,
except the brave 'and true Oinedias, to aid
him, with-Thray entdriegea at their head-he,
who'now was known as tine " Scourge of the
Pale-Faces, and the War--Ed^e of the Mo-
hawks "-ie, Sir John, wvith Guy Johnson :tiid
the ever-iifamols Butlers, Wakter and John,
was sweeping our the flair Vrlley of the Mo-
hawk, down upon tie Delaware, the Susque-
hanna, the Unadilla, and the Schroharie, to
the error atnd lestruetion of all that caea in
the way, of life and property.
So mueh for a bird's-eye glance at some of
our characters, which could  not ,well be

avoided ; and, now, back to our story, and let
incidents work their way once more.
Come with me to ~the lovely "alley of the
Unadilla. It is night, and, in a forest dense
and lofty, behold a hundred gleaming fires,
and around them   grouped five hundretl
b Bronzed  anid well-a'rmed  Indian  warriors.
Who is this, tall and nobly formed, yet
silent and stern, that stands iv a line fire,
all solitary and apart from the rest? It is the
great War-Eagle--it is Thav'endnnegra--and
these are not a tithe of the 'ed warriors who
look to him as their master-sidrit and their
leader. Why stands he there so proud andn al
alone?. He feels hims.If a very king, anid
though his throne is the heaf-strewed ground,
his canopy the star gemined sky, his sceptre
the rifle in his hand,Iris truncheon the hatchet
in his helt, his crown the eagle plumes a'ov
his lofty brow, few monarchs more potent in
their realm than he.
Ai! there comes a pale-face, all as fully
armed, threading his way along among the
warriors and 'their fires to that of Thayen-
daneea.
"Well, lion Yost, what news ?" asks the
ehief, haughtily.
"Vel, Mister Var-Eagle, de news is yust
dis," said our old Duteh friend:  " Yeneral
Ierkimer has come to Unradilla all de var fur
to see yos. Dat I finds out vile I plays de
fool in his camp."
"lie shall see me, if he be not blind. IIow
many men has he ?"
"Ymlst apout four hundreds, I dinks."
"Were they four thousand, irnstea   of fmnr
hundred, still he should see mne. Thaenlan-
egea turns his backupon no man-least of fill,
a foe!"
"Und I dinks he means to send a commit-
tee, or somedinks of. dat kind, mnit a vite flag
in der morning. I listen by der general's pig
tent, and hear dem talk that way."
"No committee of rebels shill visit my
camp!" said the chief  "Yet w"'ill I see him.
ie was onrce my neighbor and my friend'l ! lie
has joined the wron- side, and, if we meet in
battle, he must pay the cost I"
The chief then called a subordinate to his
side, tind bade hin place pickets far. in ad.
vance of his lines, to prevent any intrusion
into his eauImp,.anmd to guard against surprise.
Then, turning to Hon Yost, lie said
.' Go back to the camp of the piale-faces,
beware of their fire-water,:and gather more
news. Let me see you in the morning !"
"I vil go, Mister Var-Eagte, but yu'st blease
let me have a dollar of two, to make mine
fun with."
The chief drew the money from his pouch
aid east it haughtily upon the ground, at tha
fees of the spy, saying:
"Take it-go-but beware ot1 the fire.

"If I didn't, den does no pody, yen I seen
you: since a poy !" muttered IIon Yost, as he
jicked up the money and hastened away
upon his errand.
The chief now drew his blanket closer
around  hin, and cast, himself upon  the
F  round, to sleep as securely as an enueror
in his palace.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
-       It was morniiniand the sun rose upon a
lovely sceine. Out beyond a forest, dense and
dark,~that wherein lay Thavendniegea and
iPis shan, was a lovely plain, and it was d0t-
ted with the white tents of the little but well-
appointed army of the brave IIerkiner. There
the music of muteving men, turning out for
guard-miounting, could be heard, and bright
arms gittered in the rays of the just-risen sun.
And white pillars of smoke rose from their
many eamnp-tires and vanished away in the
blue ether above.
But from that forest of dark green, ro
smoke cloud rose to tell where the army of
the forest king was encamped, or what his
numbers were. lie was too wary for that.
It was enough for him to assure his pale-
faced opponent of the presence of Indians
there, lv sending out small pickets of red-
skiued 'varrwirs, who, in their bright blan-
kets ntid eagle plumes, strode to and fro in
front of the edge of the forest, often vanishing
back into its shadows, then coming out again
A little later, and. with a bugle sounding at
their he-n 1 nl a white flag borne by one of
the numler, a land of gaily-dressed officers
gallop from the Continental camp upon their
dashngru. chargers toward the forest.  And
then, advanring to meet them, on foot, but
slowly, and with haughty steps, a band of the
red men coei forth from their overt of green.
-     They bear an answering flag of truce.
The parties meet and halt.
" What do the pale-faces want?" asked the
leader of the body of red men.
" I wish to see Thayeradanegea I" said
'  General Ierkimer himself.
"Wait till lie comes," was the reply given
by that subordinate chief, fbr such he only
was, in a tone as haughty as if ie were talk-
ing only to a slave. And then he uttered a veil
imore loud and shrill than any clarion blast
that ever rairt the air.
An answeringc r ywas heard from the leafy
shrales bond, anm soon,.more plainly cladI,
'?      lir hbittr armed than any warrior of that
little lanir , a tingle Indian came forth from
tie for t, atl strode with a stately s'ep to-
ward tinr. his eagle eye, his tall form, his
; roid step.hut too plainly told that it was
thmavrndaeneg&amp;ea who came. As ie advanced,
Iis warriors drew up in a half circle, antd,upon
the ro;lter side, the whites did the sate, bay.
dinag 'hirrmunrted from their horses.

Th'ayendanegea stopped within the circle
3 so formed ; and. as General llerkntirte stepped
forward, the chieft ian stood with fobl-led rmis
across his breast, not deigning to see the ex-
tending hand which the general meant to
offer him, and said
"Why have you come here so near to my
camp1 '-
'Upon a friendly visit!" was the general's
reply; " we are. old neighbors and friends,
and must not war together ! "
"Have all those pale-faces come upon a
friendly visit, too ?" asked the chief.  " All
want to see us poor Indians?    It is vcry
kind I"
An'd the curl of his proud lip, and the flash
of his dark eve, told what ie felt and meant -
while, as he -spoke, he pointed to the distant
tents, and the men gathered there in crowds
to look at the interview.
" I would like to visit yosin your camp !"
said the general, wishing still to preserve a
friendly bearing with the haughty ehiet-
My camp is too small for so big a chief
as you.   You are near enough !" was the
reply.
--"Why do yrur people make war uion our
people it the Valley of the Mohawk !" now
asked the old general, corning at once to the
object of his visit.
"Because you war upon King George, who
is our friend. his belts we wear-we are his
men !" was the calm reply.
"But you are wrong. Our forces are strong,
like the trees of the forest ; in number, like
the leaves upon the trees  We can sweep
away all our foes, as the fire burns the dry
grass in the fall!"
Thayendanegea laughed scornfully, and ut,-
tered a shrill yell. In a moment, more than
five hundred painted  and  nrmed warriors
burst from the forest with deafening whoops,
discharged their guns ; then, at a wave of
'rhayenidnanegea's hand, fell back in silence out
of view.
'Coant these an hundred times, and yet more
warriors cn I bring into the field !" cried
''hayendanegea, haughtily.  "Go back, and
tell those so who sent you here !  You are in
my power; but we have been neighbors and
friends, and I will do you no harm !"
Tfie chief said, nor would ie hear any
more, but strode back as Ie came, full as
proudly as a king with millions.at his back.
And the pale-faces dared not follow him,
for the advantages upon his side were far too
great for threm to risk a battle.
CHAPTER XXXV.
A lofty luill, rock-ribbed but tree-crowned,
is that which overlooks from its southern
hank the Mohawk at its Little Falls , And
from this lofty height the eye cart stretch far

away along the. thread of silvery water from
mast to west, and gaze with pleasure down
upon the rushing, foaming, flashing torreints
hat dashes by below.
Upon this height, some time after Thayen-
danegea had met the fearless IIerkimer at
Ulnadilla, stood two women.   One, whose
hairs beginning to speck with threads of gray,
proves that age is coming fast upon her, or
that care is dongt the work of time, is our old
friend Dyagetto, the mother of the Eagle of
be Mohawks. Still stern and commanding,
till beautiful, still every inch a forest queen,
but yet looking far more sadly than when we
saw her last-for then she was all radiant
with joy in the recovery of a long-lost hus-
band-min the triumph of her noble boy.
But yho is this by her side? An Indian
maideni; yet for such, how peerlessly beauti-
ful ! Tall, of exquisite form, so well revealed
by her forestngarb,'with eyes large, black as
starless night, yet so piercing that they seem
at times to look you through, and then
again to melt into your very soul with their
liquid light-features which can express- the
haughty pride of a chrainless will, or yet the
tender thoughts of a heart which can love in
spite of the pride which bids it own no rns-
ter.    . .  .   .
The picture is drawn; but who-wro is she
that tams breaks, in majestic beauty, in upon
the ivil i panorama of our story ? Let the se-
quel tell.
They stand upon tie very verge of tie
cliff which overtops the stream below, look-
ing with strung eyes up the river, as if from
thence a visit was expected.
. Baek from them, in a lovely grove of cedar,
is a single wigwam, and the small fire before
it shows that it is their camp. And but a
little way to the left is a iound of newly-
heaped-up ground. Can it-be that, " dust re-
turned to dus' is reposing there, and'that
death has laid another of -his countless vie-
tims there ?.
"Your eyes, so 'young and bright; loan,
niust surely see a speck far up ite iver !"
said .ya etto to the maiden a~ lier side.
"IHis runner srid thatirewould be here when
the sun was s+ high that i4 ease n) shadow

" I see nothtingt; but- aidtek upon the river's.

"I'.ona does not love, else she would not be
so patient. Time is stnail, it only ertawls!",
- low can I lvoa him, whom my eyes,
have not looked .upon ?" said the makfen,
cahnly.

-lie Irmay rutiu anll tine warrior; of the North,

and yet not hold control of one proud heart !"
said the maiden, with a flashing eye, while
she pressed her hand over her heart, to indi-
cate her meaning.   Then she adied, more
calmly : " When I look upon him, if he is
what I have seen in my dreams, I shall love
him, and if I love him, he must love me, and
I 'viii win him or I will die !"
"Surely now I see something far up the
river !" said Dyagetto.  -
" Yes !" said Iona; "it is the flash of a
paddle, dipping up water in the sun-rays!"
After a short pause, she said :
"It is a Canoe, and there are t-wo in'it; and
one is a warrior, tie other is a worhan. IIe
said he would come alone !"
And already, though she sail she loved not,
the maiden's eyes flashed, and a fierce look

a love. In some hearts jealousyy is natural,
intuitive, and in such hearts to love is to ho

Swiftly down the rapid stream, more swift-
ly as they drew nearer to the falls, canoe the
canoe, and both the wovnen watceld its mo
tions without a word, for though Dvrgetto's
face expressed surprise, not uminnxed with
anger when the keen eyes of lona saw, andn
her lips announced, that there was a woman
in the canoe with the warrior, sine spoke not
the thoughts which gathered in her brain.
The canoe, coming down the centre of the
stream to take advantage.of the eur-knnt, shot
along almost to tie falls; then ''havendanegea,
with a powerful arm, turned its irw v'toward
the shiore, and in a tnornent more was there.
'-A'pale-faced wonhan, lerhiaps a prisoner!"
muttered Dyagetto.
If Thay endanegea is so gentle to a pri-
soner, vhat woald- he be to a wife ?' said
Ionn, as' she saw him carefully lift the lale-
faced maiden Un the 'ockv bank. The sar-

"Is she your wife ?" asked Dragetto.
"No-here is my wife !" thundered the
War-Eagle, touching his rifle. "Will you get

"1 will get it!" said Dyagetto, now in a

"Was she not the 1ovi laias maiden

whom I saw when we came here ?" asked
Kathleen, timidly, of Dyagetto.
" Yes. I will go seek her," said Dyagetto,
speaking more kindly, perhaps, for toe uncon-
scious compliment paid to her favorite by the
por girl.
The woman departed, taking the path
which Imoa had chosen. She soon returned
with the Indian mtiden, whose eyes indicated
by their looks that she, proud as she was, had
beei weeping.
"This is lONA, the daughter of a chief of
the Sonceas, who fell in battle by the side of
the brave IIendrick !" said Dvagetto, as she
proudly led her protegee forward. " And,"
she added, " 1 have taken ieres my da-ughter,
tor I have lost Onalova, who choe a pale.
fac-, and took herself out from her mother's
heart
And Dfyagetto, as she uttered these words,
so full of meaning. looked at Thnayendanegea,
to see the effect of them.
But his eyes were fixed upon Ione, who
stood with eyes downcast before him.
"She is too big for a woman---she should
have been a warrior, like her father!" said
Thayendanegea.
"It I aim a woman, I have a Warrior's
heart in my bosom !" said loon, and nmow her
raised eves flashed back a 'light as proud as
that of his own.
"Good ! You shall be my sister, like this
poor lily of the pale-faces. whom  1 found far
from  the wigwams of her friends, and have
taken to be my sister !" said Thayendateega,
and be took Kathleen by the had and led her
forward. " Be sisters," he added, "aand I
will see that neither of you go hungry or
meet with harm !"
loon drew up haughtily, and would have
refused the ready hand ot' at hleen, had shine
not caught the warning look of the crafty
Dyagetto, which told her not to do so, anl
she took it, and said:
"What the great War-Etagle of the Mo-
hawks speaks must he good. I will lie hcs
sister, and, for hisoake, will try to love the
lily of the iale aces !"
" I sun far froni all other sisters, and will
love you veryda'rly !" said Kathklen, as she
took the hand'of Jona ; but she almost shud-
dered at its icy coldness.    :
Dyagetto, who seemed to wish t' avoid a
formal recognition of Kathlien as a daughter
iN the Intdimino form,u'ow found sudden occasion
to busy herself elsewhere.

as he goes, in a tone loud enough to be heard

words:

Reader, hover with me rover a battle-field,
the battle-field of ORISxaNY.
Thie air is close, yet clear, though rising
clouds in the far east betokened a'storm to be
near. We look down, and all is still i-n the

the tramp of armed men, the hurried word of
command.    Ah, see, they come, under the
flag of the United Coloies-old men, nil
middle aged, apd young-some in uniform,
and some in none, but a soldier, every one
ready to battle, and, if need be, to die for their
country's cause. On, with the veteran Herki-
mer in command-on-on they march. Now
they are in the'ravine, along carelessly over
the treacherous swamp and causeway-on,
until they are within the crescent of that
thick forest---on, until the head of the line is

And there, as calm as if the ;fe-blood was
not flowing from his wound, he sits and gives
his orders. Johnson's horde of tories eame
sweeping down with the red nuieni ; but IIcr-

Thayendarregea, as be stood before iris wig-
warn at the Indian quarters near Fort Schuy-
kr, on the night after his retreat from the
fearful fight at Oriskany, in whclh his Mo-
hawks arid Senecas had suffered so fearfully.
IIe spoke to a warrior who certainly did
Y t seem  over, eighteen. it so much; yet he
was of powerul build, so far as eould ibe
judged-though his caped hunting-shirt, fast-
eiet to the neck, did not expose what seemed
to be a frill amd brawny Chest so mnch as the
open and careless garb, or no garbm, of other
warriors; and his wide leggins, extending to
his ankles, concealed limbs, which should have
ben muscular. But, whatever his build, in
that day's fight Ie had shown himself inferior
k* skijl and valor to none but the great War-

Eagle himself, and thrice, at the rik, of his
own, had saved the chieft:in's hie:
He wore his war-paint so tidekly, and a
heavy turban so shaded his brow, that of his
loIeks we can say'but little, except that hisfaoe
seemed boyish ;;but. his eye--it spoke a heart
wilder, fiercer than that in the tameless eagle.
or the merciless tiger of the nrth.
Are yoi a-Moh-wk?'continued the gross
chief.
"I wish I   are,'that the great War-Rtado
could call me brother; that I could fi;ht for-
ever by his side, sleep only at his fire mint
only for him, and be his guard at all time,:by
night and by' day-; but I am a Seneca by
birth !" said 4he yottng Indian, modestly, 'but
not without enthusiasau.
" You shall have your, wist! Before ail

Thamyendanegea.
4And by the Great Spirit, you wll nt

" By the Great' Spirit, I will, not !" anid
Thayendanegea, pleased with tie earnest en-
thus.asi of his 'newly-adopted brother.
."Theni I am contat-ias lifa--in death'--I
will be as I was to-day !" said the yong nL-
dian, and his form sceeied to grow more tall.
and his eye more-bright, and his breast to ex-
paul withhappiness as he spoke.
What wonder? No higher honor could -b
given to a warrior iui the 3ix Nations'thaihe
had received--he was to he thenceforth the
brother and lifergaard of the great head. of
the confederacy.
.  Where is'1hayemdanegea?" asked a shirp,
imperative'voioe near them at that moment
"I am here. Waat does 'Walter Buler want
of me?' asked the chief,' haughtily, and ens.
phasisimg the name which he uttered, as it
he, did not like the man, or rater the jpoet
who asked for him.
' General St. Leger has ordered moe p iion
secret mission of great imaportauce-I ari to
take fifteen men and you the same. Hon Yost,
whom you know, is to be our guide !"
"Where is the order? I an iny mn ci a
tired!' said Thayendanegea.
"Is not; my word suffieient;?"asked Butler,
impatiently.
"I will take the ford of no pale-face, belhe
friend or foe. Let the _general send his or-
der!" said Thayendanegea.
Butler turned away, and went for the order,
for he dared not triflo with 'the man who bad
hut to speak to have his scalp stripped feom
his head.
Not even didSt Leger dare to thwart the
proud Mohawk in hi ,ways.
Butler soon returned, and he bore a polite
note from General St. Leger, in which the la+.
ter requested -Thayendanegen, the great chief
of the Six Nations, to accompany Lieutenant
Walter Butler upon an expedition of'groat
importance to the cause.

Thavendanegea read the note, and, turning
to the bearer, said :
"I will go ! Bring your men and guide
here-i-nine will be readyy"
Butler bit his lip, and a frown was on his
brow ; for,,aristocratie and tyrannical himself,;
he eould nt bear a master, but he turned and
went for his rren.
The first of the patty who made his appear.
anee was Hon Yost, evidently having a good
m'ad of the "ardent" on boursd, and carrying
a bottle of the same in his han/..
"=Got niclt, great Mister Var-Eagle." Vil

S"Yes! I will take it all'* said Thayendan-
egea, as he took the extended bottle and dash-
ed it against a roel near by.
lion}Yost for a moment stood 'aghast. He
looked first at the fragments of the bottle, aml
thid at the chief, paused a moment, and then,
handing him his pipe, said :
' Yust p.reak mine slhmoke-pipe, too, if you
pleae Mister Var Eagle I".

the ohief, as he dashed the pipe alongside of

Tlayendanegea now gave a low call, nail
a suiordinate chief appeared, whom he di-
s'eded to pick out fifteen men, true and trusty,
for the expedition.
zAm I to go as one 1" asked the newly-
ad.pted brother.
" We are but one, and I name you Niscayu-
!as " said Thayendanegea, nai, as he armed
bimself for the expedition, ie threw over
Nissayuna's shoulder a belt of the royal wam-
pnm, such only as was worn by himself, and
Shaded hira a tomahawk precisely like his

He examined Niseayugra's rifle, and said:
"This is not sure--there is a better !" and
anded lhim one like his own, with'its aceou-
trements.
Butler now made his appearance with his
men, and, as IlIon Yost was quite -sobered
with lias loss, the- party started.

x4                    CHAPTER XXXIX.
About two miles above Fort Dayton, stood
one of those old-fashioned Dutch houses-of
which few specimens are now to be seen in
the Mohawk Valley-large gabled structures,
as full of windows as an ancient village maid-
en is of gab-no offence venerable virgins, but
I must Cr:ve a comparison, even if it is at your
expense-nnd, at the time of which I write,
it was pretty well filled with a party of stories,
or of those who, sedueod by the specious pro-

clamations of General St. Leger, a..i the feat
that their property would be destroyed by the
advancing foe, wese'being inehned to bke the
side of King-Geerge,
.They were a higglepiggled set, Scotch,
Dutch, but,-to-their credit be it said-in that
day there were'very few Irish disinelined to
our patriot cause. Tie proprietor of this
mnrision was a- regtular-built, ,fill-ri:tged, old
tory hessian, by birth and nature. his name
was-Diedrich Schoomaker, yet so careful had
he beep to conceal his sentinments, th:t the
Tryon County Committee had not shipped him
off, or looked to his nodious aufhcietly tQ de-
teet him'in his'evil deeds. his house, being
back from the main-road and in an out-of-the-
was situation, suited the tories eceeently for
a r'ndc:vous, and ,as such it had bern used
8siree the commnencement of the war.
It was fall niidnight, and the great kitchen
and dinner-room--both being   one in such
houses-was pretty ubarly crammed with men
of the class which I have named. Diedrich
Schooraker was in his glory, for he presided
over a puncheon of rum in one corner, from
which he measured half-pints as tast as they
were called for, and that was about as fast as
they could be drawn by him.
" The health of.King George," was the only
toast allowed to be drunk, an- "success to his
cause" waste general ad  ition after the drink-
er had recovered his breath.
- Though most of those present seemed very
well contented with their cheer and their eon.
p:any, some there, were who exhibited great
impatience, and cursed more than a lit.le--
somewhat as the army is said to have done in
Flanders-because some person or persons cx-
pected did not make his or their appearance.
It was, perhaps, an half hour after mid-
night, when a person hastily entered from
without, and immediately one of the loudest
of tIe grumblers cried out:
"Gentlemen. come to order and make room,
for the deputation from the camp pf General
St. Leger has just arrived, and will enter the
room in one moment 1"
"Yes! and yust make room from pefore
mine rum parcel, for dey'll Ipe sure to be dry,"
cried the hospitable and most loyal Diedrich
A moment later, and.Thavendanegen, who
allowed no man to precede him, either in
war or peace, strode into the room, followed
by fourteen of his fierce-looking warriors,
Niscayuna being close by his side. Walter
Butler, headed by Ion Yost, and followed ;y.
fourteen of his men, came next.
There was no need to say make room. When
the people glanced at the great War-Eagle
ard his followers, they fell hack like sheep be.
fore a pauk of ,wolves, and he moved to the
upper end of the room, near where Diedrich
Schoornaker was, through a broad avenue.
"Crest Mr. Injun, vi~ you rind your mena
have a trink r' cried Died-ieh, wishing at creeo

THE WAR-EAGLE OF TIHE MOTIAWKS.

to make favor with that party, and he ad-
vanced with a gallon measure of rum in his
hand.
" Curse your fire-water-Mohawks are not
beasts !" said Thayendanege:a, indignantly, as
he struck the measure from the astonished
Diedrich's hand, and spilled its contents upon
the floor, which needed washing with rome
kind of liquid.
"Mein Cot in himmels, vat a       aste !'
groaned Ilon Yost, who was, as if by scent,
finding his way to the rum-puncheon with all
haste.
"'It is late, and this meeting will at- once
Crme to order, to hear the proclamation
which I have the honor to offer inthe name of
General Parry" St. Leger," said Lieutenant
Baitier. mounting a very appropriate stand for
a spirited address, it being the head of Died-
rich's rum barrel. " But before I read the
proclamation, copies of which I have for gen-
eral distribution, I will say," continued the
lieutenant, "that, in the troops of both classes
which I have brought here, not as a guard, but
as a specimen, you see only a few outof thou-
sands just like them who must-"
" Surrender to the arms of the Continental
Congress !" shouted an officer, at the door,
who was dressed in the uniform of the Ameri-
can army. "You are surrounded-resistance is
useless-he dies who tries to escape t"
With  a wild bound, and Niscaryuna by his
side, Thayendanegea sprung through the pas-
sage by which he had entered. His warriors
would have followed, but the terrified crowd
closed in, and cut thers off from their leader.
All was terror, shouts, confusion I
-eatla, nota second, and the War-Eagle,
ndiching his tomahawk in his hand and ut-
tering his terrible yell, which was known but
too well, was at the door-out of it, upon the
soldiers who were placed before it: 'Iwo fell
before his blows, another dropped beneath
Niscaynna's hand, and they were clear ; for
the line was broken, and tley were speeding
off like deer in the gloom beyond pursuit. A
few scattering shots were fired after them, but
they were far tide of their mark. Soon the
forest was gained, and then Thayendanegea
paused, and said
"My brave brother, we are safe!I"
"Tire Great Spirit protects the brave and
.the good I" said Niscayuna, as he pressed the
hand of the War-Eagle.
They were safe ; but where were their late
companions? Let us go back and see.
Scarcely had Thayendanegea and Niscayu-
ns escaped from the room, when, from every
evenu-, Con neutal soldiers entered with fixed
bayonets ; at every window  glittering steel
_     was seen.  Those within saw but too plainly
bow mad aand useless it would be to resist.
Even the Indians were panic-strieken, and
stood quiet and waited for the result.
"   aSurrender, sir !" said an officer, approach-
ig Walter Butler.

" To whom r' said Butler, turning pale, for
he knew tihe doom generally awarded to a spy,
or an pnemy who sought to incite people to
rebellion.
'Colonel Weston, ,of the    Continental
army !" ciied the officer, reaching lrii hand for
Butler's sword, which was delivered
" Cot in himmels, I surrender, too 1" said
Hon Yost, as he bent down before DiedricWe
rum pnneheon, and surrendered himself to fuli
a pint of its contents.
The soldiers and Indians were all speedily
disarmed; such of the persons present as we
known tories were secured, while the rest were -
dismissed, with the information that Genera)
Arnold, with a powerful force, was at Fort
Dayton, and would not onlysweep the enemy
from the land, but severely punish all who
'were recreant to the cause. And as the young
hero, then, of St. Johns, Montreal, the pasgetge
of the Kenaiebee and Chandierre, was iii the
zenith of his fame, and known to be as severe
as he was brave, the cheek of Butler paisd;
for he knew that of all others, he would, be
one who, from rhis position, past and preset,
it would be desirable to make an example  f,
The   prisoners, properly secured, were
soon marched off to Fort Dayton;,and, as might
have been supposed from what Arnold awas
then, an immediate court-mirtial was ordered.
Its result must be the subject of another '
chapter, while we turn off for a brief spacedo
a scene, which it were a mortal sin in me:to
fail to describe.
CHAPTER LX.
After the fatal victory of Oriskany, General
Herkimer was conveyed upon a litter to his
residence, which still stands upon the lovely
banli    the Mohawk, about two or hree -

Bellingers, Seebers.Saumens, Davis,HIelne "s,
Petries, Deggerts, Snells, and many other.
Upon his arrival at home, had Iris old m "i.

soon made Iis escape-to become the most dia-

knew. Even then Arnold seemed to begin to
feel a sympathy for villany !

Hon Yost was condemned to die. The gal-

hour was named. Troops were ordered out
to guard the proceedings.
I said that he had no friends. Ah, wh:lo
she lives there is one friend who never will
desert us ; in peril, in crime, in tribulation a
mother will cling to her son!
Arnold, having given all ttie necessary or-
ders for the execution 0t the unapphy Dtutch-
man, had gone into the house, with some offi.
cers, to wash down any qualms which he
might have had with a few glasses of wine
The glass was at His lips when an aged wo-
man, wild and gipsy-like in look and dress,
rushed into the room and knelt at his feet,
crying for mercy, in the name of God, for
poor lion Yost. It was his mother who
plead. Her furrowed face, brown and care-
worn-her streaming gray hairs, tears pou r-
ing out in floods, her sobs and moans should
have tonlehitd a heart of stone.
But Arnold would not hear or heed her.
Another pleatver came ; a man with more
heart and sener than the other, and he even
offered to suffer im sis stead, " for," said he,

E m to this appeal the then less than man
and after traitor closed his ears.
But now another influence was brought to
bear. Colonel Willett whispered a word in
Arnold's ear.
The latter listened to the suggestions offer-
ed. lie ordered every officer out of the room
but Colonel Willett, bidding the mother and
brother of lion Yost to remain. lie thea
gave orders to have lion Yost brought before
The latter was led in, closely bound and
guarded by a file of soldiers. They were or-
dered out, and then Arnold harshly addressed
the poor, pale, trembling creature, who, how-
ever brave lie might have been elsewhere,
was now dreadIfully terrified.
" Villsn," said the greater villain of the
two, "I am about to have you hung; but
you nay say good-bye to your mother and
brother here !"-
"Oh. mine Cot, Mister Yeneral, ton't hang
poor lion Yost !" cried the nihappy fellow,
dropping on his knees.
"What will you do for me if I intercede for
your life ?" asked Colonel Willett.
- Any dog--any dig vot is possible or im-

poor fellow.
"Will you go, after I have had your clothes

"Yes, Nister Kurnel Villett, I vill do dat,

force around Fort Schuyler. Why do we see

these hundreds of Indians gailu'ved in silence
around this one wigwam, from which lproceedE
the monotonous tun, turn, turn, of the liden
drum, and a low tong to the Manitou,or Greal
Spirit? Iissatisfied with the result of the-dem
feat at Oriskany, miournin over the loss of so
ninn of their chiefs aid braves, and angry,
too, at the deceits put upon them by the Brz
ish leaders, the Indians are holding a solend
pow-wow to ask the Manitou, through one off
their prophets, if they shall hot abandon the
expedition, and return home.
And not alone are they discontented. Theei
pale-faced allies, especially the Causdians all
Hessians, who, unlike the stories, had no hate ta
influence them, but fought for ten cents a day
were sickened with the toils of a siege, so far
only a losing game on their.part. Andeven the
leaders ha  passed high words. Sir John
Johnson and Barry St. Leger, each probably
jealous of the other, had fallen out. But togo
back to the pow-wow.
Except the sound of tlje prophet's drum in-
side the sacred wiigwam  reeted for the ocea-
sion, all was still in that vast assemblage.
Each moment they expected to hear the Mai'
ton, to whom 'their prophet was prayi ,
speak through his lips:
But something comes to-break the stillness
A man, with rent garments, pallid and terror-
stricken face, sweating and gasping from fa-
tigue, rushes in among them.
It is Hon Yost, whom they all know an1
hold;in awe, for they deem him one whose
brain has been touched by tlhe finger of the
Great Spirit. lie fearsf'not, heeds 'not the
pow-wow-he tells them the fate he has e-
caped-that an army is close at hand, which
will sweep themdway as.the gale bears off the

many .-he points to the trees of the forest, anI
says, "More yet than they."
hark ! How the pow-wow prophet comes
sweating and steaming from his lodge. Ihi&amp;
face, too, wears a look of mystery. Through
him the Manitou is to speak.
"The Great Spirit, is angry with a! W
must go home and give feast to 4A in our owl
villages !"
The Manitou had spoken-no need for i me
other words from Ion Yost there.
Generals St. Leger and Johnson soon off
served the general stampede which the Indiani
are making, and hear the rumors which,
through lion Yost and the Indians, are flying
through the English camp.
ion Yost is sent for into their presence.
"What means this, ydu dog of a spy, this
report that the American army is so close at
hand ?" cried St. Leger, livid with rage ; for,
almost sure of the surrender of the fort by
morning, he was maddened at the thought '.
a failure which would tear to pieces theisnure
wreath, which he believed to be already e y
twined for his brow.

"The rain will do the'flower good," he said,

Thayeinlanegea, in the same language.
"I will be the eagle to tear thy dove asun-

"You may talk, you are my mother," said
Thayendanegea, quietly,
Niscayuna now returned perfectly calm, and
Kathleen, having wept away her first burst of
feeling, modestly, and with blushes upon her
soft cheek, withdrew her white arms from the
War-Eagle's neck, and sat down on the moss
by his side. liut she no longer looked sorrow-
ful. 11er face was radiant with the beauty of
joy.                               .,
"Niscayuna, how do you lile my sister?-
as you are my brother, she too is your sis-
ter"-asked Thayendianegen.
"I like the Lify of the Pale-faces," said Nis-
cavuna. "She is more beautiful than the stars
at'night, or the flowers which follow the going
off of the snow
Kathleen looked up at Niseayuna as lie stood
before her and said this, but a slight shudder
passed through her frame, and she dropped her
glance, for his eyes seemed to pierce her, and
she felt an unknown fear of him-felt that lie
was her enemy. And she clung closer to Thay-
endanegea, as if she felt, dove as she was, she
could say to the great War-Eagle: t" I dare
trust thee !"
"When do we go upon the war-path again,
my Brother ?" asked Niseayuna, whose keen
.    eye had' noticed that averted look, and even
that slight shudder.
" Soon--we must not be idle while the ene-
mies of King George are so busy," said Thay-
endanegea ; and then, when Kathleen clung to
him and looked up imploringly in his face, he
read her thoughts in her looks, and said :
"Do not tremble, my dove, no harm shall
come to the Lily, and when this war is over,
there shall be flowers for you to walk upon !"
-"1 do not fear for m-self. but for yon !"
she said, softly. "If I die-it is'hut a drop

and once more his bosom was a resting-place
for her heal.
While Thavendanegea was engaged in sooth-
ing this new'burst of grief, with a tenderness
unusual to his stern nature, and new indeed to
himself, Dvagetto caught the glance of Nis-
cayuna, and with a look, called him to follow
her. Whither they went, or what they paid,
being to me a mystery, must remain so to the
reader.

"If yon will go again, oh, takie me' with yoi
I can bear fItigue. I fear no danger, only let

poor Kathleen, when she became more corn
posed.
"Sweet dove, it cannot be. Thay-endanegea
could not fight with one eye and all his heart
upon you. lit his eye looks upon your ter.
ro, and now he knows its cause. You shall
no longer be left alone with her who would not

of braves around you, who with their lives
shall answer for the safety of the dove that
has built her, iest in my heart ! And when
again I come back, I will take the dove to i
bosom, and it shall rest there forever I"
And probably for the first time in his life,
did the lips of Thayendanegba touch those of
woman,'for now he bent his noble head down
and pressed his lips to hers.
She wept no more. A lofty feeling seemed
to enter her heart. She said, and she looked up
proudly : "lam the betrothed wife of Thayen.
danegea ; I will be strong, and fit myself to ba4
warrior's wife !"
"The Great Spirit tells me that you will
Be strong, and Thayendanegea will not be so
careless of a life which inow belongs to the
dove of his bosom !"
Once more he kissed her, and then they
arose and walked toward the wigwam. They
had but just passed out of sight of thespot
where they had been seated, when Dyagetto
and Niscaynna stepped from a covert neat
enough for them to have seen and heard all
that had passed. They made no reinarks, but
by different routes followed Thayendanegea
slowly to the wigwam.
CIIAPTER XLIII.
Another wild forest scene, and once more
we are among old acquaintances. Upon tie
banks of the swift Tioga, amid a forest of the
loftiest hemlocks, was formed an encampmen,
mnch such as we have described before, whea'
the ill-fated IIerkiner met Thayendanegea at
Unadilla. IHere, as there, more than an hun-
dred cheerful fires blazed up in the gloom of
the night-here, as there, five hundred red
warriors moved about them, roasted their beef
or their venison ; but there was now a greater
show, for this was Thayendanegen's great war-
party returning from a sweep through a vast.
portion of the country east and south, where
he had gone almost at will, subsisting his men,
of course, upon the phmnder of those whom he
deemed to be his fors ; yet more merciful than
Ibritish or tories, slaying none but those whom
he met in arms against him. Tents, provisions,
stores of various kinds wise plenty, and also
horses to carry them. And this was his choedi
band of braves, the veterans of the war, i a
"old guard" of the Napoleon of the forest.

Thayendanegen uttered these words with a
-careless seor, which no pen could describe,

"My tops are beyond your line of senti-

Thayednuegea made no reply, but gave an

the repose from which they had been aroused,

"Yes; you are a rascal, but too good for

a blanket, take it and sleep !" was the brief,
but to the =poor Dutchman most satisfactory
reply.
Thayendanegea now spoke a word to Nis-
caynna, who brought him a blanket, which he
wrapped around his form, and scorning the
shelter of a tent, raised more for form than
necessity, in such weather, lay down to sleep.

CHAPTER XLIV.
One night more, and another camp. Who
would believe it? the united forces t' Butler
and 'TChayendanegea, of which, by his British
commission, the former is in command, are
encamped upon a lofty hill, evergreen covered,
within one mile of the village and fort which
they intend to attack. And this, although
the colonel in command, Alden, has been in-
formed of the intended attack. But, like
Braddock in the French war, aid. still later,
my poor friend .Dade, in the Florida war, ho
held Indin cnning as well as courage at too
light a weight, and was sunk by it in conse-
quenee.
And here, too, guided by the knowledge and
skill of Thayendanegea, they had been led, in
broad daylight; so that before they hid down
in their blankets for the night-as they did
without fires-they could count the soldiers in
the garrison, see every house in the 'village,
and even notice every spot where a sentinel
was posted.
That might,-before he made dispositions in
regard to-his own movements in the morning
(and history proves it), Thiayendanggea, much
as he hated Butler, held an interview with him
in regard to the sparing of fanniies in the
place -telling him that friends of General
Johnson and his own fattier dwelt there.
But I cannot pause. A painful task is be-
fore me; and the sooner it is over, the better.
Iaving marked the position of every senti-
nel the night before-leaving Dutier tochoose
his own point of attack--Thayendmmnegea, at
or before dawn, while snow-lakes were falling
thick and fast in the air, moved down the hill
with his men. Butler' with his "1 Iaingers "--
alias murderous tories-taking t heir route.
But before they reached the vilinge, a set-
tler, going in on horseback, crossed their path.
lIe was fired upon; but, in te darkness and
mist of the morning, he escaped. TIhe alarm
was given-gunms tired ; and all was now ex-
citement and confusion. Butler anl his han-
gers, without oven approaching the garrison,
sprung to a work of general desolation and
carnage. Thayendanege&amp;s heart, saviage (:') as
it was, thrilled with horror when he found how
he had been betrayed by the iend Butler.
One of his chiefs lie sent to protect the vener-
able minister of tme place - others he sent
elsewhere ; but he hastened to one family, of
which he had spoken particubirly to the hated
tory. lie was too late when he arrived at the
house of Judge Wells: the family were slain I

'fhius rebuked, Butler turned away-not in
shame, for he had none ; and Thayendanegea
went on, to save.
From the moment the garrison was alarmed
and the fort secured, he knew how useless it was
to try its strength wlhout artillery. his wish
was iunpossihIe; and now, sickened and dis-

CIIAPTER XLV.
Sill another camp-fire, and one more mel-
ancholy than any yet ; it is at a half-day's
marehfrom Ciecry Valley, toward Niagara,
whither Thayenlanegea, with some imlporLanit
prisoners-'eeded to effect "exchanges'-is
bound.lMelancholy, because these poor pri-
oners have been suddenly wrenched from their
desolated homes ; some have left living rela-
tives behind ; others have left those whom they
best loved on earth, dead and stark upon the
ground.
The camp is in a beautiful and romantic
spot-it is in a dense ravine, where a broad
glale of autumn-dried grass spreads out a soft
carpet for the fort. Through its centre, winds
a rippling stream, on its *n  to the Susque-
hanna.   Upon either hn , seemingly  all
around, rise muountains,. crowned with ever-
green, so steep that they almost seem to topple
over the iama below.
Here in this dul, hitherto so lone and still,
where few human feet have ever trod, liut where
the red leer has rejoiced to feel and play, rest
all of Thavendanaegen 's band-for he has not
lost a man--and their prisoners.
Butler, with his tory iugers,.and a few mer-
cenary Indians, with whom l'hayendanegea s
band have no connection, have taken another
route.
Bold in his conscious strength and fearless
nature, the W\ar-Eagle has caused his camp-
tires to be lighted as usual ; for he knows that
no force beh.id wil be strong enough to follow
him and if thieydid, he would almost, or quit:.,
rejoice at the ebaice of a fair i ght--so sickened
and hisgusted was he at the butchery of the
morning, so dissonant with his own character.
It was after nil tie canip was still, and suh
o. the lr:soners as would eat had been fed, tiat
Tlaveninuiea went to his own camp-fire,
where ll n Yost lay sleeping, and Niscayuna
sat on witeh

ie approached the fire, cast hini~&amp;!f down
on his blanket, and I sr a time remained in
thought--sad thought, for more thun once a
sigh rose from his breast. At last, he said :
" Niscayuna, from the day we fought at
Oriskanyuntil now, you have clung to me as
the vine clings to the oak. You are my bro-
ther. There is a stone in my heart to-night,
and I cannot east it out. There is a cloud be-
fore my eyes ; it is very dark, but in its centre,
I see the Lily of the Pale-faces-the White,
Dove of my bosom. The path of my feet is to
Niagara, but my heart wants to walk to the
wigwam on the Mohawk !"
Niscayuna listened in silence--he did not
even ruse his eyes from the ground, upon
which he was gazing.
"I must send a messenger to the White
Dove-will my brother go to her ?" continued
Tluayendatiegea.
'fThe frame of Niscayuna shook as shakes the
aspen leaf, when the winds are breathing
quickly ; but lie made no reply.
"The White Dove is in a net! She calls
upon the Eagle to save her !" continued Thay.
endanegen. And his strong frame shook with
an agitation which it had never known be-
fore.
siMy brother only dreams a bad dream !"
said \iscayuna, at last, in a low and tremulous
voice. But yet he did not raise his eyes from
the ground.
It is no dream, for I cannot sleep !" said
Thayendanegea. "Ther low voice moans in my
ear all the time-the Dove calls 1or her Eagle,
and says: Come to me, or I lerish !"
" Mv brother's ears are filled with the sounds
he heard this .morning-pf the doves which
then were cruelly sent to the spirit-land !" con-
tinued Niscavuna.
" No-my heart bled for them; there is only
one voice now in my heart-it is the voice of
the Lily.' of the Pale-faces-of the Dove of my
bosom! "
" Let my brother, the Great War-Eagle be a
man, and not weak, like a woman. Let him
sleep, and rest will drive away bad thoughts !"
" I will listen to the words of nv brother-I
will try !" said 'i'hayendanegea. Al lie drew lis
blanket around him, and covering his head,
tried to sleep.
And   iscayuna, upon'whose face an hun-
dred thoughts seemed to be painting them-
selves, as it below, iii his heart, many passions
vre at war, looked at the form of the reclining
warrior ; but he did not try to sleep. And at
titans low murmurs would rise to his lips-the
thought of his heart trymg to get out Iromn
their prison.-
" l)agetto,-has kept her pledge !" he mur-
nired. "The War-Eagle never shall be wed-
ed'to a cursed pale-face!"
"Who spoke ?" cried Thayendanegea ; and
he half arose from the ground.
"Ihe wi+d was groaning imeong the caverns
of the hills I" said  iscayuna. "All else is still,

f

but the singing of the water as it goes to dance
with its sisters in the Crooked River !',
"I cannot sleep-the. voice that is in my
teart is too loud .'
Ie rose, anl for a long time walked to and
fro before the fire ; his agitation not decreasing
in all this time, but rather becoming more
violent. At last he addressed Niscayuna otee
more
" Will my brother be my messenger to the
White-Dove. I dare no trust another. My
brother loves me. lie has proved his love.
I have proved it as the strong man proves the
bow !   Will my brother go to the White
Dove ?"
"Will my brother let his memory go back
to the night after the fight at Oriskany ?"
asked Niscayuna.
"I lose my eyes, and it flies back swiftly !"
replied lhayemdanegen.
"Then itsees the hour when the Great War-
Eagle bade Niscayuna call him brother before
all the Nations l" continued IN iseayuna.
"it looks upon that hour, and the eye is not
dim which sees it," said Thayendanegea.
"Has that memory an ear, as well as an
eye ?" continued Niseayuna.
" Only one ear : so that which goes in at the
one, has no other to flee out of."
"Then it hears Thayendanegea swear by the
Great Spirit, that 1iscayuna shall nevcr be
driven from his side !" cried the young war-
rior ; and a look of triumph sat upon .his
features.
"it hears the oath, and Thayendanegea will
not break it !" said the warrior; but there was
a deep sadness in his tone. -
lie spoke no more ; but sat all the night
long by the fire, evidently revolving some
lplas in Isis mind ; for the great veims is is
temples were failing and rising, as if fhse
thoughts were coming and going from the
heart-to the'brain.

It wus morning. The war-party was afoot
while yet the gray dawn hung upon the
track  of departing  night. The   morning
food was cooked and eaten; the prisoners pre-
pared for the days journey ; and all was ready
or departure.
Then Thayendanegea called his sub-chiefs to
him, and upon a piece of white'bark he
marked out for them their course, and the dis-
.ance they must make upon each day's jour-
Icy. This done, he told them to go on, and he
;vould overtake them upon the route. IIe had
another work to do, and must go and do it.
The bird with its sorrowing train moved
on, and hut three remained : Thayendanegea,
Nisca vuna, and IIon Yost.
"Why do you not go with them ?" asked
Thaayenlanegea, sternly, of lion Yost ; and he
pointed to the departing party.
The name Susquehanna, in the Indian language,

"I have had a tream ;, and must go na rder
Xar-Eagle to der Aloawks ' said hion Yost,
quietly.
uie Greit Spirit has spoken-who else
could have told him  where TIhayendanegea
was gedng'?" muttered the chief to hiniself
Ties i-e added aloud:- " You shall go I hasten
to cook food. We sleep not-pause not-till
we get to the Mohaw.k!I"
Niseayua said nothing; but if the chief-
taitis heart had seemed very heav ythme night
before,hi heart seemed i tnsmes hiehvier o1.
On the contrary, new life seemed to have
come back to the spirit of 'rliavetidanegea
from the moment that he had forced his do-
termination.
"          CHAPTER XLVI.
Before the new and elegant wigwam which
Thayendanegea had caused to be built for
Kathleen, before he last went upon the wvar-
p)ath, were gathered the Indians whom he had
left to guard her with their hives. Upo their
faces, both grief and surprise vere visible; for
their young queen, as they had lea ined to re-
gtrd her, was nowhere to be found. Sihe had
won upon their respect and love, by dressing
as the Indian mnaidetns dressed ; ana her new
hopes had so improved her looks, that r. her
new garb she was wondrously eae f.d, and
seemed more to them like an aigel f '"m the
spirit-Lmnd than a being of niortal me ord. Iet
eye expressing but a wish, it was ace :oplislied,
'l he choicest game from the forest, the finest
fish fr-om the waters, the swctst b irds that
beat the air with feathery iiion-all were
laid before her. She wished to make a gala
suit of clothing for Thayendategea, to show
him on his return that site could do as hIdian
maidens did.   They taught her how, and
brought her the materials; for Dyagetto, who
remained spitefully in her old wigwan, would
show lies-nothing.
Mute atid sorrow-stricken, they stood before
the wigwam ; for this was the second . day since
she had been missed, and far and wide had they
sought for her, arqd found no sign. Whe' they
had asked Dya retto about her, she b ghed
scornfally, and  id :
" I suppose you slept upon your goril, and'
she stole away from you. The pal Bees are
treacherous, and do not like the re n!"
But- these warriors knew hio diShe loved
Thayendanegea, and how she tre.1 ad in them;
for she never would move fl-rA the wigwam
except when they went to g   i 'her. Some
suggested thit she had b ec  Efted up to the
spirit-land; but all shook te, heads, an mur-
mured -
" What wi.'l Thaijendane te' say ?"
While thus standing, a distant and a cheer-
ful cry was heard. Oh, boa well they knew

and trembled. And Dyagetto, too, came now;
for she hid heard the far-oif cry, and with a
singular E:iie upoli her face, she caine to wel-
tome her toin to his wigwam.
Soon he eame bounding on, as light as a
buck. which, when the morning air is fresh,
hears the hottne13 afar off, anl despising them,
sprigs the earth beneath his feet. In a moment
he was at the wigwam-door, beside which hung
the beatiful dress which she had made for
him. Ils eve rested uon it a pleased second
--he .n n w i was her wor k-then supposing ihat
maiden mioE stykept her within, lie entered
the w;n.npi jut. as lion Yost and Niseavuna
arrived, loth almost breathless ; for it were a
fast runner who could keep up with the love-
lace of the \Var-Eagte as he neared the nest
where he hai1 h ft his flower.
lpyng tto and Niseayuna exchanged one look
of intel ligence, and then seemed no more to see
or know ci other.
In a Fomenit, Thayendanegea re-appeared,
wonder upjons face, but as yet no other ex-
pressio1.
'    rWhi ne is my White-Dove?  Where is the
Lily of V heart ?  Does she hide from Thay-

No rpv ws made but by looks.   lie saw
that s: thn     was wrong, and his face
changed like the sun when a cloud sweeps
acro  it.
" e is the Lily ?" he thundered.
The wariirs trenibled ; but not one of them
dared be die irat to speak. But Dyagetto, in
a sarca-t a,: tome, sai:
"A hi:-d told me, that while your warriors
slept, ie stole away, to find a pale-faced
lover."
"Wionim, you lie! The bird that threat-
ened to tear myc dove to pieces is the only bird

thumlernl Tlhiyenlanegea ; and with every
vein swclbrn- as if it would burst, his form
distemino  as if he was about to spring upon
her, he awaited her answer.
"Ask th r-von left her with them !" she
said, and 1ojitel to the guard.
For an mitiat, mastering lis passion with a
m:ghty eurt, the chief turned to them, and
asked ini expilin:tion of the manner of her dis-
jparnie.
'Ilie on whom lie haid placed as captain over

'alnilanegea looked at lion Yost a mo-
ment as if he would read hini through ; then
said:  .    ,,
" I will go !"
Ion Yost led the way, at once, to a path
which wound along a ravine down to the small
level upon the bank of the foaming river, lie
was followed closely by 'hayenianegea; next
by the warriors ; and last of all caine Dy a-
getto and  iscaynai.in.
Without a moment's hesitation or faltering,
lIon Yost led the way to the same ravine
where, in times long back, we traced the
Wicked Aroghiyadecka ; and paused not until
he reached the very spot where, [or years, the
noble Ogahtee had suffered. l'ushmg aside
the small stone in the mouth of the cave, he
said :
"Call to your gird, Var-Eagle. I dinks
you find her here !"
" I this care ?" asked Thavendanegea.
lie needed no other call. his voice had
heen heard ; for a clear, sweet cry came up
from the gloom below :
" 'Fitnycndancgea-'linAYEmDNEr.A I Ihbnew
you would come -"
It was Kathleen!
With a cry of mixed anger and delight,
'Ia vendhanegen would have tried to force his
way through the narrow aperture; but Ilon
Yost restrained him, and only said
" Come mit me-comeinut roe. Var-Eagle!"
Ie then leaped around the ngmle of the rock'
to a spot whre only two could stand. From
a ledge overheard, placed where no one would
see it liut one who knew it was there, he drew
n stout lever of wood. lie insertel this be-
hind, or in ihe crevice of what nppeiared to be
an imninensie rock. With but very little effort,'
it yielded to the leverage ; and opening,
showed that it was. but a door to the cavern,

and sobbed until she tried to dry his tears with
ier many kisses, and almost chidingly asked
if he was not glad to see lier.
" Oh, so glad---so glad-nmy heart will break
out from my breast!I-it is too big!--let the
water run from it" he said, in \ones so low
and soft you could not have believed that they
came from a warrior's tongue.
In a little while, he was more calm; and
holding her in his arms, he followed lon Yost,
who-with a delicacy which men accredited of
sense might not have exhibited-had gone on,
and permitted that noble burst of feeling in'a
biave heart to go unwitnessed.
When Thayendanegea appeared to his de-
lighted warriors with their loved young queen
in his arms, they rent the air with their shouts
of joy, and led the way out to the river-bank,
where the glad sun was shining -makitig the
river and the wild foaming cataract look like
a mixed flood of silver and of gold.
Dyagetto and Nisoayuna had disappeared ;
but, in the general joy, no one seemed to no-
tice or think of that. Once upon the firm
shore, Thayendanegen released his precious
burden from his arms ; and putting her down,
stood and'}looked at her, in her beautiful
forest garb, and in the renewed loveliness
which love and hope had given her, with the
same intense admiration which some soul-
enwrapped artist bestows upon a work just
finished - which, for him, has been the toil,
the study, the sole ideal for years upon
years.
Amid then, all heedless-of the presence of his
warriors, he caught her up to his breast, and
kissed her again and again, until, in a whisper,
she reminded him that they were not alone,
while she blushed a treble beauty at the
thought.
"True, my own one !" he said, gently.
Then, turning to his warriors, he bade them
go up to the wi wam and prepare a feast, while
he and the Whnte-Dove walked by the water-
side and talked.
All obedient, and now doubly swift for the
happiness which they felt, they hurried to do
so, while Thayendanegea, as he became more
calm, clasping the hand of his loved Kathleen,'
walked up along the brink of the foaming tor-
rent, and sought to so still his emotions that
he could ask her how she was placed in the
cave-for he feared his own anger, and Wtished
to master it while he could. -
.Reachinu a spot just above the cataract,
that where first he nad landed with her, he
sat down upon a log close by the fringe of
bushes at the foot of the clill, and directly
beneath that lofty look-out, where she had
stood so many patient hours watching for him,
and placed her by his side.
Now more calm, he asked hr the questions
which he wished. And she told him a long

then how Dy agetto had ii vain tried to gel

after she had- retire to her rest, feding very
sleepy after she had supped, she awoke in the
cave, and heard the taunting voice of Dyagetto
cry:
"My son shall never wed a-pale-face! You
shall dse !"
A warning cry was heard from the crest of
the cliff at this instant ; but, U  God of
Heaven! it was all too late to save ; for as
Thayendanegea started   at the sound, his
mother, leaping like a tigress from the covert
close behind, sprung upon poor kathlneen
seized her in her arms, and at a single bouni
was buried in the rushing waters !  or a mi
ment paralyzed, Thayendanegea stood, and
then would have leaped after those who were
now buried far amid the rocks below, hiad not
Niscayuna caught and held him back-or tried
to do so, for the chief struggled terribly. In
the struggle he would have succeeded, had not
some of the warriors from above, who had ut-
tered the warning-cry, reached them just as
both were on the water's brink, and drew
them back.
And now the garments, rent from the boson
of Niscavuna, disclosed the fact that a woman
stood before them !
Thayendanegea, faint from exertion and ex-
citement, gazed one moment, and uttered the
name :
"IONA!"
With beaded head, and blushes darkening
her face, she drew the rent galrments over her
bosom, and threw herself weeiiig and terra
fled at his feet ; for in his look she read that h
had in a moment divined her agency in this
matter, and her motive for putting on male at-
tire, and following him every where !
With folded arms, he stood and grew calm,
fearfully calm; for there is a cairn of determine
action which is fearful! Iis warriors stood by
in silence. They looked upon him, and did
not dare to speak ! The scene was too full of
suspense--it was maddening !
At last she rose and looked at him--oh! s.
h art-brokenly !       -
"Go seek her you have torn from my bo.
som I" he said, sternly.
One look at him-one heavy sigh which told
that her heart had burst-and she obeyed ! The
dark waters closed over her, the white waters
received her, and her spirit fld after those
which had gone before !
The Mohawk braves trembled and breathed
quick breaths ; but Thnayendanegea, without a
quiver on his lip, like a moving statue of
bronze, turned and said, in a tone lioarse and
deep, but strong :
