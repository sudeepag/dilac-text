we have described.

this chapter. and excuse the  digression.
Twice or 1r'  did the old gentleman pass
the door of the Exchange office which stands
at the corner of Broadway atid -  street
and nervously look to see that there were
no eunit)mers within.  What could he, such
a well known and respectable citizen, fear
from the world's observation. Surely he
could not do wrong to enter anit "Exchange
othie ." lie s0e1 at last that the coast is

hitd a green venetian screen which conceals

plies the old gentleman with slow and dig-
nified tones.  Then taking a large old-
fashioned  leathern pocket-hook from an
inside breast pocket-lie took from it some
papers, then laying them down, he took
from another pocket his spectacle case and
adjusting the eye-assistantsupon his Roman
nose, carefully examitncd the aforesaid
papers.
Mr. Greenly will you permit me to
trouble you for a glance at the drawing

" Certainly Mr. M. here it is and the

The old gentleman carefully looked over
the drawn numbers of the day before, ex-
ainied his tickets one by one and with a
sigh laid them down again.
All blank-all blank !" he said in a
low sad tone, and shook his head, with an-
other sigh.
Better luck to-day, you drew a prize
but a fe'v weeks ago, Mr. M." said the polite
exchange brother.

CHAPTER V.
In each chapter, so far, we have brought
new characters before the reader, and we
must do so until all our drameatis persona
are introdiuced to their very numerous ac-
uatintatces.
The next scene we will lay in the front
attic bed-room of a boarding house in Mur-
ray street, not quite a dozen squares from
liroadway. 'Thie room is fittedup as well as
the la'dllady can alord. She only charges
six dollars per week for the board of itstwo
occupants, allowing them the use of her
parlor to receive company in. This is very
reasonable, and it ought to be, for they are
two desolate old maids, and  that isn't
their fault. Were they old bachelors, I
would'nt ilanie her if she skinned their very
"ye-teeth.
One of these maiden ladies-Miss Aramin-
tha Peony, the elder, is in the room. She
acknowledges to being thirty she did so ten1
years ago-but she has never gone beyond
it-probably she ever will, although Mrs.
lonnifess the landlady says, judging from
her appetite, that she'll live a very long
tim. ier cheeks, thanks be to Gouraud,t
present a very healthy appearance-her hair
is very thick, curls, and is glossy and soft t
as that of a country belle who bathes hers in
the morning dew. It would be wrong to say l
that the celebrated Ciprico had anything toc
ho in furnishing the roof of the upper story i
of the tenement which we are describing, so h
we are mum on that point. Her teeth are
white as pearl. and regular as a christians
daily walk. Castle, the great dentist, has
seen and admired them. The lady was so s
elated at his admiration that she actually
presented him with fifty dollars as a testi-
monial of her appreciation of his judgment. A

Some envious woman went so far as to in-
sinuate that she had seen the teeth before-
but we don't believe they are anything but
natural.
Around the room on nails ruthlessly driv-
en into the plastered wall, hung many dress-
es-silks, satin and calico-of various cut
and style, some of them more gaudy than
true taste would justify, some of them sulli-
ciently expensive to infer that the strings of
a long purse had been drawn to effect the
purchase. This, in comparison with the ap-
parent scantiness of means which would in-
duce ladies to lodge in an attic, seemed
rather singular, but "singularities are" any-
thing but singular now-a-days.
A very small stove which would not hold
more than a double hand-full of coal, warm-
ed, or was intended to warm the room, and
close up by it engaged in sewing up a rip in
a tight gaiter-boot, sat the lady. Often she
paused in her work and intently listened as
if she expected some one.
"I do wonder why Malvina Ann stays so
long!" she said, impatiently. "The draw-
ing must have come-if we don't get a prize
this time, we'll be bothered dreadfully till
we get our money next quarter-that is
three weeks off yet. I can't do three weeks
without money-we must have a little just
to keep up appearances    Malvinamust,
for that Mr. Townsend is worth catching,
and he seems particularly smitten with her!
Ah, that's her step, I'm sure it is-I hear it
on the stairs, and she's singing ; oh, I know
we've drawn a prize !"
The door opened and Miss Malvina Ann.
he youngest Miss Peony, entered the room.
Snatching off her bonnet she threw it on the
ow, narrow bed whilh stood in one corner
of the room, and out of breath from hurry-
ng up stairs and singing, sat down beside
ier sister.
"Well-the prize ?" asked the latter.
"Oh let me get breath !" cried Malvina-
then I'll tell you-luck has changed, we'll

While she draws breath we'll glance at
Malvina. She is five years younger than
ramintha-and looks ten, at least. She

CHAPTER VII.
WE have seen Mr. Brent and his son-i,-
law at home in their respective residences
and we will now take a look at then in
their counting room. It is near three, and
their closing hour approaches, for in our
wholesale houses little business is done af-
ter banking hours are over. Charles is

"Wheler? oh, what did he say? He to and fro-over the carpeted rorm. He

" o. iter!                          tions of the day.
"Then what id he say ? come, don't.    Outside, the porter and two or three

salesmen are busy arranging the store and
ware-room for closing.
"You and Mary were at the opera, last
eight, you told me this moriling, did you
iot, Charley?" asked Mr. Brent, after Bren
non closed his cash hook and ledger, and
locked them in the safe.
"Yes, father-Mary is so fond of music,
and I wish to do all I can to make her
happy
"You are a kind, good husband, Charley I

''e are very happy, father !"
''Ion  t loit it. my boy, and I hope
you'll always be so-but I like to see mar

than abroad. And Charley, I don't want
to see you let your expenses go ahead of

"I wonder if he can suspect anything?"
muttered Charles, after his father-in-law
'departed  "lie must, or he wouldn't be so

special and particular in his advice, it is
true that I am going beyond depth, and if
my luck doesn't change. God only knows
when or where I shall touch bottom. There
is that two hundred dollar acceptance comes
due at ilinkel's in the morning. I must
borrow it from the safe, and I dare not
enter it on the books, for I've already over-
drawi my salary, and the old man still
keeps up his habit of looking at the books at
the end of every month. I believe he'd do
it if lie had the angel Gabrielfor a book-

but all since have been blank. Bit heii

no more !"
Brenuon unlocked the heavy door of the
sate, and taking out a little drawer counted
from a pile of' bills in it, the sum lie had
mentioned. As he was about returning the
drawer to its place he heard the door behind
hin.open, and ste)s approaching. his face
paled and his limbs shook witl agitation.
lie was conscious of'wrong.
"hallo, Mr. Brennon, busy yet? It's at

Brennon recognized the voice of his new-

in the drawer, and closing the door of the

as wax. IIcr brow was high, her whole cast
of countenance betokened intellect and re-
finenent. The manner and appearance of
her mother, for such was the relationship of
the eiler lady, betokened the finished and
well-bied lady. But the scanty, yet neat
furniture of the room, betokened poverty.---
The lithe cooking stove in the room, the bed
in one corner with its snow-white counter-
pane,t'he wash tub in another corner and sonic
few articles of clothing, hung near the stove
to dry, all gave evidenit token that this was
their only room and that they did their own
house- work. loth the ladies were dressed
in deep mourning, in cheap stuff , but their
aplarel was so neatly made up and so well
suited to their line figures that it did not
look Conimon.
True gentility will always discover itself,
no miater how it is garbed. You cannot
make a gentleman of t clod-hopper, no
more than you can make a kid glove out of
cow-bisle, nor can you by any change of
circumntances make a gentleman by birth
and eucation forget his position and ac-
q1uiremen ts.
The ladies were engaged in sewing, ma-
king up clothing for some of the down-town
stores. They both locked weary, the elder
more especially.

for her own cup of tea, (she never took
more or less.) live cups of tea were her

Of course he kissed the book.
And though she took no oath, it is as cer-
tain that she returned the kiss. In fact the
oath was repeated several times, probably
to make it the more binding. I like to ad-
minister such oaths myself, they are never
compulsory, nor subject to cross question-
ing.
But a ring at the hall door bel startled
the parties froin their occupation, and the
servant announced Mr. Tullius Catlin. The
brow of Mrs. Brennon clouded  Well might

Catliin bowed low to Mr. Brennon, as he
entered--lower still was his inclination to
the lady. Ie was dressed elegantly-not
exactly beyond taste, but very richly. his
garments were of the finest texture, the
most exquisite fit and the latest fashion.
The only jewelry which he exposed was a
diamond pin of great value, in his worked
scarf ; an immense ring of the same jewels
on his linger, and a gold watch chain of the
most curious fillagree workmanship.
'Good evening Mrs. and Mr. Brennon !"
he said as he entered. '1 am happy to see
you looking so well. Having nothing on
earth to dispel the care which ever clouds
the heart of one who leads a solitary life, I
thought I would accept your kind invitation
and come over and sit an hour or so within

"To whichJmyself and wife, most heartily

"Certainly-pray be seated I" said Mrs.
B. faintly.
Mr. Catlin took a seat and appeared per-
fectly at home. . But his practised eye had

wrong. What it was, his wisdom could not
lenetrate, but he determined to know be-

man masters, over which our critics rave in
raptures, or that I am very solemnly im-
pressed with the nasal thunder of a thousand
voices when they break forth in 'Green-
land's icy mountains ;' but a sweet song,
from a feeling heart, always finds an echo
in my own. I love in a still moonlight
night when wandering pensively by a lake-
shore, in the shadow of trees whose leaves
whisper back answers to the wooing of the
breeze, to hear from afar off over the limpid
water the rich, full breathings of the flute.
That is music, is.it not, Mrs. Brennon ?"
"It must be sweet'" said the lady, who
unconsciously had been listening with ic-
terest to every word he uttered.
"Will you not favor us with a song ?-l
observe that your piano is already open !"
continued the visitor.
"Pray sir, excuse me-mine may be a
fashionable excuse for a young lady, but as
I am a married one, you will believe me
when I say that a cold really incapacitate
me !"
"Of course, I would not be so rude as to
press you !"
"Won't you take a glass of wine, Mr.
Catlin ?" asked Brennon.
"Thank you, no, my kind Sir-I seldont
partake of wine except at meals !"
"You smoke ?"
".'ever ! I am free from that vice--o
perhaps I am wrong, I should not call it a
vice ; a 'bad habit,' would be abetter name !'

woods had been poisoned upon it, and that

wras carrying it over the ocean to introduce

"Certamly, love ! - and the young wife
seated herself at the piano. 11er jewelled
fingers ran like living gems over the ivory
keys, and she evinced a skill that few of her
sex could attain, in her execution of several
pieces of the most ditticult nature. Science
had finished for her what natural genius had
commenced. Her father had spoken truly
when he told his son-in-law that he had no
need to go to operas or theatres to hear
good music-he had it at home.
Thus im conversation and in music the
evening passed oil very agreeably.  Mr.
Catlin used every endeavor to make himself
agreeable, especially to the lady. His ideas
were expressed in the most chaste ternis, his{
principles seemed of the highest order.
Even B3re'nnon who had only seen Catlin "in
the rough as we may say, began to enter-
tain a far higher etimate of him, much as
he had thought of him before. lie had no
idea he was so retried, so well inrormed-
so much of a gentleman.
And tio lady-she who had so disliked
and dreaded d him? We can only say that
much of her prejudice had vanished t
It was quite late, between eleven and
twelve, when Catlin rose to leave. Bren-

CHAPTER XV.
ANoTitEt character yet, in our Drama,
and a strange, but a true one. But first
well raise the curtami and look at the
scenery in which he is 'bound to shine."
Come up into the attic of one of the old-
est cribs in Ann street. The furniture of
the room is simple, even less expensive than
cleanly. It consists of one old stool-a
bench which looks greasy, as if it had been
used for a table, and a small laying or gath-
ering of old blankets and rags in one cor-

ner, made up not exactly bed-like, but as
something had slept there.
There is an old auger-hole, or knot-hol
in one end of the bench and therein is stue
the remains of a tallow candle and close bf
side it lays a piece of charcoal. We woul
be puzzled to know thme use of that pieces
charcoal, were it not that figures are marke
heavily in black all over the once-white
washed wall, evidently traced by the coa
Scarce a spot on the four sides of the room
or on the plastered ceiling above, that wa
&amp;       not covered. We will keep the reader ii
the dark no longer. This was and is th
room of
a character well known to all the police
dealers and many policy buyers of Nevw
York.
I have described his room and his furni
tnre, and now will ring him in. Behold
an individual of sixty, who looks full eighty
His thin hairs are not grey or white-.-they)
are a dirty yellow. Like the veterans o
"76," there are very few left. His teeth
having mostly taken leave of absence, have
left his upper lip unsupported and it droops
toward the nether, sympathetically. Him
nose sees to be sharply looking after its
friends below. But hiskeen grey eyes, like
glow worms encastled in a skull, gleam out
with a strange, strong light. his form is a
study for an anatomist. It is that of a once
handsome, appollonian figure, now reduced,
not by the knife or scalpel, but by time and
want, to "skin and bone."  A few ragged
clothes conceal its interesting outlines from
the man of science, but the Anatomical Mu-
seum with all its boasted treasures, could
not show a better specimen.
Believe me reader, that man was once the
central star of fashionable society-courted
and admired-yes envied ! Talk of ro-
mance and fiction-BEALITY beats it all. I
am no novelist, I do not claim the name or
the fictitious honor-I am a painter and I

and be a king!t"
He took a pinch of snuff and then counted
y his money. Twilight was spreading its fog
--he could scarcely see the numbers on the
bills, so he lighted his candle in the bench.

light and then cast himself down upon the
bundle of blankets and rags in the corner.
In a few moments he seemed to have fallen
into a profound slumber.  He ,breathed
heavily, but regularly. Soon afterwards
he began to mutter.

The sleeping man, for he was already
asleep, rose and going to the bench took up
the piece of charcoal. Though his eyes
were closed, he turned his face toward every
part of the room as if he was looking for a
blank spot to mark something upon. At
last, he knelt down on the floor and on one
of the planks marked in heavy, bold figures,

his marks.

IN the eighth chapter of this story I intro-
duced the reader to Constance Morley and
her mother, and left them suddenly, as a
knock at their door indicated a visitor.-
Whe they heard the knock, Constance at
once went to the door, and opened it. A
gentlemanly dressed man stood upon the
threshold, one who, in garb atnd in looks,
did not resemble a robber or a ruflian. Miss
Morley would at once have asked him to
come in. but he spoke first.
"Is this the residence of Mrs. Morley?" he
asked.
t ii, Sir !" said Constance.
"And your are-'
"IIer daughter, Sir !"
"Thie I am right; I called to see you on
business !"
"\Walk in and be seated, Sir-My mother,
Sir-"
"My service to you. Madam, my name is
Catlin. I am in a heavy business down town,
and having occasion for iiuch copying, and
having heard that your daughter wrote rap-
idly and well, I called to see if I could not
engage leer as a letter-copyist !'*
"Twould be better than sewing-how
much can she earn 7 asked Mrs. M.
'-I'm not particular in regard to compen-
sation-if twenty dollars a week will remu-
nerate her, I shall be happy to give it !"
"Towenty dollars a week?" asked the old
lady, scarcely believing her ears.
"Yes, Madame, and more if she thinks
after trying the labor that it is too little !"
"Really, Sir, you are too generous!"
"No. Madam-I have reasons for every-
thing I do. Do not think me entirely dis-
interested. The man who does a good
u. Lion and says that his motives are wholly
unselfish, tells an untruth. There is a ,no-
tire at the bottom of everything. I have a
motive. I knew your late husband. ie

once did me afavor ! I have not forgotten
it. It was only two or three days before
his death. I but lately heard where you
resided, and the first promptings of my
heart were to call upon and see it I could
serve you. I beg you not to think that it is
only you whom I serve, for in the business
I am in, your daughter's services as a copy-
ist will be fully worth her salary, and I
serve myself by engaging her !"
"I fear I cannot fulfil the duties of the
station, Sir !" said the young lady, timidly.
"I have had'no experience
"It requires none, only that you write a
plain, legible hand. That you write an el-
egant one, I can vouch
"Ilow, Sir? You have never seen my hand
writing '"
"Yes, Miss Constance, I saw   a note
you once addressed to your father. It was
written in pencil and evidently in a hurry,
but he showed it to me and I admired it.-~
This occurred only a few days before his
al demisel0 !"
The widows eyes filled with tears. The
words of Catlin recalled the past. Tears
were not strangers to her, however, and she
treated them familiarly, she brushed themii
away.
Catlin did not remain long. While he
was there, his conversation was free and
friendly, even as if he had been an old ac-
'guaintance, but in no way offensive. llrs.
Morley was delighted with him-he seemed
so kind, so alfable, so generous, and withal,
so unostentatious.  Constance was pleased
with his manner, yet intuitively she seemed
to shrink from him. Yet when he gave her
a card with his address upon it, she prom-
ised to call on the morrow to arrange the
preliminaries for entering up upon her du-
ties as a copyist.
Ile took his leave. As he walked from
the door he muttercd-"She is fast in my
net. I'll pay Morley for his last favor, now.
I wish he could see me cancel the debt. Not
two hours before he killed himself, he struck
me in the face and called me thief! The
blow burns yet-but he shall pay for it
through those whom he has left behind.-

Iv.was eleven o'clock when Catlin, after
leaving Brennon's house in Brooklyn, ar-
rived at Grab's rooms. Yet the last named
gentleman was up. lie was occupied as
usual in smoking a prime IIahana.   As
usual, he occupied two chairs, his legs across
one. No one but himself was in the room.
"Ah, Tullius," he said, as our villain, for
Tullius Catlin is the villain, not the hero of
thisstory, entered-"I'm glad you have come
in. 1 was getting go to-bed-atively inclin-
ed, as my friend Willis says when he's

"I'm anythingbut sleepy just now-we've

dent of a visit which I made to-night-to get
a peep at a pretty woman, we might have
lost the best pigeon in our trap!"

"The devil, you say !"
"Yes, sure as shooting. You see I took
a fancy to his wife, she is heavenly, the first
time I saw her. I thought this evening
I'd pay him a visit and study into her
character a little so as to see how I might
make my advances, for a woman is like a
fortification, you must know something of
its position and defences before you dare
to venture an assault. Well, as I said be-
fore, I went over-when I went in I saw
that clouds had been hovering over the
parties. Before I left him I found out the
reason. She had found otit that he had
been buying tickets, was horrified, a curtain
lecture had ensued, her father having taught
her that murder wasn't half so bad as buy-
ing lottery tickets. He had promised of
course to quit !".
"How did she find it out?"
"The fool dropped the last package he
bought, in his bed-room, but I've got it
from him and now the only way to hold on
to him is to let him draw a prize from
these numbers-at least a five thousand
dollar go!"
"Well, you can fix that, my boy. heave

IT was the next day. In a lottery office
in Centre street stood quite a motley crowd,
behind the "screen." Several of them wore
black, some were women or had been once,
before raggedness, rum and filth deprived
them of woman's first right, that of being
looked upon as the connecting link between
the angels of heaven and we sublunary
masculine humans. They were all listening
to
who for a'"consideration" offered to tell his
dreams of the night before. Fifty cents
apiece was the "consideration." One old
negress who had but one eye-and had the
white blotches of small pox on her scarred
and ruin-bloated countenance, seemed most
anxious to take advantage of his offer.
"I wind seven dollars and a half off o'
your las' dream, Mr. Evans," she said--"I'll
try you again, here's your half, now whis-
per me what's de gig to-day !"
Evans bent down his mouth close to the
ear of the hideous hag after he had received
he coin, and whispered numbers. She left
to buy a ticket at another ollice, for she
didn't want any of her companions to know
what her number was.
One after another paid Evans for infor-
mation as to what would be their luck that
day, and it is needless to say that they im-
plicitly believed him. He ofcourse helped
the lottery and policy dealers, for the most
of his credulous friends spent their last dime
in purchasing tickets.
*    *    *   *    *   s
How was it with our friend Brennon-
was he in "luck" that day. Yes, in good
luck as far as mere winning was concern-
ed, but in bad luck when we remember that
he was allowed to win only that he might
be led deeper into the snare of those who
sought his ruin. It was about elevent or
"lunch time" that Brennon as he promised,
met his friend Catlin, at the "Shades."

The face of the latter was flushed with tri
umph.
"I predicted you'd be in luck, Charley,'
he said, "and I've not made a false prophe
cy! You had the lucky numbers and havE
drawn ten thousand dollars !"
"Ten thousand dollars " gasped Bren
non-"TEN T~lO~JAND~ DOLLARS? You'r
joking!"
"Does this look like a joke ?" said Catlin
as he handed Brennon a roll of bank notes
--"there is every cent with only the dis
count off."
"Well--you are a prophet, by Jove I
didn't dream of this raood luck !"
"What'll you do with the money?" asked
Catlin
"I hardly know-I've some old scores to
pay !"
Brennon blushed as he said that, for the
"scores' he alluded to was the stolen money
he had taken from his father-in-law's safe,
which he was now about to return before
his misconduct (crime I had better 'say,)
had been discovered.
"They don't amount to much, I expect !"
said Catlin with assumed carelessness.
"No, not a great deal ; about nine hund-
red dollars 1"
'Well then, after clearing them up, I'd
advise you to buy your excellent and beau-
tiful lady a full set of diamond jewelry.
The ladies are always well pleased with such
marks of attention from their husband!"
"But Mr. Brent when he saw them on her
would at once ask how I could afford such
a purchase. Ie knows that I possess noth-
Ing beyond my salary !"
"Tell him that it is from the proceeds of
a legacy left you by a relative !".
"My wife who detests falsehood, would be
present and hear me most likely and I
should lose caste in her estimation. I've
many faults Catlin, but I possess one virtue
-I love her better than life!"
"But she'd for give a 'white fib' when she
gazed on the glittering gems !"
"I fear that I should see gems brighter
than them, tears glistening her eyes! Cat-

CHAPTER XIX.
ONCE more we'll take a glance at Mr.
Grab's office. As usual the clerks are busy
-not this time with their ledgers, but en-
gaged in sealing and folding circulars.
What were these circulars for and to whom
directed? Judge- by each clerk having a
directory before him of various towns ini
this and other states. And the circulars
were invitations to buy tickets, puffing the
"schemes" &amp;c. They were being directed,
bushels of them at that, in defiance of our
laws, to citizens whose names were found
in the Directories, for the purpose of draw-
ing more victims into the entangling meshes
of the lottery net. Not a rail leaves our
post office that does not contain thousands
of these infamous missives, sent forth to de-
coy the unwary. Beware of them. I have

without any trouble. Morville is a brother-
in-law to Alderman B    , and a nephew
of Judge D-    . We can clear Glendye
through their aid, for I possess a secret
about this same Morville that would give
his family rather unenviable notoriety.

within could observe even a greater display
of luxury there. Paintings, if not quite
delicate, of a far more voluptous orde
adorned rits walls. The walls were n
painted or papered, they were hung wit
folds of pink satin which gave a mello
rosy'light to the room. The curtains ov
a couch in an alcove of the room were mad
of gold-colored satin, deeply fringed wit
lace. Everything else in the room corre
ponded with this in richness.
I have been thus particular in descrip
tion, because I wish to show what a letter
dealer can afford, how a man who but a fe
years since was a convicted thief, working
his time out in prison, who has until lately
lived literally "from hand to mouth," cat
"rise in the world" by becoming an agent
a useful agent in the heaviest and most in
famous traffic in this city, lottery and police
dealing.- My Tullius Catlin is no coinag
of the brain, his wealth, shrewdness an
talent in villany no picture of fiction-h
is alive, in the city, and I am only giving
the devil his due in every line I write about
him. And I am doing it and this task
exposing the Lottery League at a risk which
few would care to undertake. A million
of dollars capital, yes more, lays ready to
be used to crush me. The assassin's hire,
the lawyer's fee, the juror's bribe, the
judge's temptation, the poisoner's reward
are centred in the millions held by a few
men, who in open defiance of our laws are
ruining thousands of our citizens, robl/ng
the poor and swindling the rich, making
wreck of families, desolating once happy
homes. dragging young clerks into the dun-
geon, and breaking fond mother's, beloved
sister's and confiding wive's heart's.
But for the only reward which I ask, the
satisfaction of exposing.villany and assist-
ing virtue, I am content to run the risk.
Life is not, never can be dear to me, and
while I possess it I'll do my duty.
But back to my story : I must get loose
from the thread of my tale once in a while
to stick my needle into the cursed creatures
'       whom lam describing.
Mr. Catlia had not long remained in his

tY elegant parlor or office, before a liveried
sO servant, a negro as spruce as one of Mrs.
r, Stowe's favorite heroes, entered and an-
ot n9unced that Miss Morley was at the door
h waiting an audience.
W    "Ask the lady in !" said Mr. C.
er   She entered, looking more beautiful by
e far than on the two occasions when we have
h before met her. Her cheeks flushed by cx-
s- ercise in the open air, and probably too by
her prospect of lucrative and honorable
- employment, were like an opening rose-bud
y -her dark-blue eyes were bright as the
v ocean water when the sun rays dance over
g it. IIer tall, elegant form appeared to ad-
y vantage in the neat mourning dress which
n she wore. 11er little black bonnet set far
, enough back to reveal the faultless of her
- lassie brow. And withal she looked ma;
y jestically innocent. Oh how much true ma-
e jesty there is in the innocence of a woman.
i Even the heartless, brazen-faced libertine
e shrinks abashed from it and flies to seek a
suitable atmosphere in the presence of the
t flower, which, when its innocence perished,
f lost its fragrance.
"I am most happy to see you Miss Mor-
ley," said Catlin, bowing excessively low
to the lady as he handed her to a chair. "I
am also happy to see you so punctual to the
hour."
"I always keep my promise, Mr. Catlin,'
she replied, "and never make a promise that
I cannot keep !"
"And therein you are superior to many
of your sex-many of them make promises
which they never intend to keep!"
"Yes, Sir, such may be the case, but I
hope such specimens are few and far be-
tween?"
"They may be, I do' pot acknowledge to
much experience, for my business life allows
me but very little -time to mingle in the
society of ladies. Is your mother well ?"
"Quite well, I thank you Sir. Can I
commence the duties of the situation you
have so kindly offered me, to-day ?"
"Yes, Miss Morley, but at first they will
not be very arduous. I have only to request
you to copy in my letter book three letters

your week's salary in advance. Here are
two eagles-"
"Oh, Sir, really-"
"Make no excuse Miss Morley--I remark-
ed before as a friend to your late father, I
felt a right to act like a friend to you."
The young lady took the money without
speaking. The emotion caused by the al-
lusion to her father whom she hrd so much
loved, was like a finger placed over her lips.
Mr. S. then handed the letters to her
which he wished copied, (which I need not
tell you reader, without you are very green,
were got up expressly for the occasion) and
said
"I am called out by business, and must
be absent an hour or two. My housekeeper,
Mrs. Caneouse, is out, but will be in shortly
and may afford you company enough to
keep you from being lonesome. She is a
good, kind old lady, I look upon her almost
as a nether! Though indeed I know not
what a mother is, for mine died while yet I
was a babe-my father also, and I have
grown up in the life-field alone!"
"I'm so sorry ! There is nothing in early
life like a dear father and mother !"
Constance uttered that sentence so feel-
ingly, so naturally. so sweet, that anything
less than a ruffian heart, case hardened in
the forge of hell, by the hand of Satan him-
self, must have felt the force of both tone
and words.
But Catlin, more hardened than the
Arch Fiend himself, insensible to pity aslhe
was to honor, felt not even the breath borne
from the t sweet flower, by the gentle zep-
hyrs of sympathy.
lHe left the apartment. Did Constance at
once sit down to her task of copying those
letters? No. Woman from the time that
Eve wanted to taste the forbidden fruit in
the garden of Eden, has been afflicted with
curiosity. She seems to take the disease
naturally and never to care the price of a
brass pin or a broken heart for the conse-
quences. And our sweet Constance, like
all pretty girls, had her share of it. (Ladies,

Constance, when Mr. Catlin left, took a
look at all the pictures in the parlor, ex-
amined the furniture &amp;c.; not satisfied with
this, she peeped into the inner room.
"How rich he must be " she murmured.
"And he is handsome-he is intelligent, he
dresses well !" she added.
Did not Catlin understand woman-nature
when he left her there alone. IIe did and
the first seeds of his design were already
sowed in her pure young heart. lie had
excited the two first of the three most
dangerous parts in the composition of a
woman. First her s/mpnathy, next her ad-
miration.  The other dangerous part is
love ! Why so?  Because though it is the
father of happiness, it is the step-mother of
jealousy. But I don't know enough of the
subject to philosophise on love, so I'll quit.
Constance, after her brief survey, seated
herself at the table and commenced copy-
ing the letters. She had nearly finished the
task, when the door opened, and an elderly
lady, plainly and neatly attired, entered the
room. Constance was pleased with her first
look at the lady, she looked so kind and
amiable.
The latter spoke first
"You are the young lady, Miss, that Mr.
Catlin has employed as a writer?"
"Yes Madam?"
"I'm glad to see you, he speaks so highly
of you and your mother! I am his house-
keeper-after you are done writing, I hope
you will come down in my room and have
a friendly chat with me, I'm quite lone-
some !"
"I will with pleasure, Madam. Have you
been long with Mr. Catlin V"
"Yes, for many years. Ie is a kind good
young man, and so moral in his principles!"
"'It is strange that he don't get married !"
said Constance.
"So it is, but I've often heard him say he
would never give his hand where his heart
could not accompany it !" replied Mrs.
Caneouse. "Yes," she added, "and I've

heard him say that he'd rather marry a gir
who had not a cent in the world or a second
dress in her wardrobe, if she loved him, than
an heiress who did rot !"

CIIAPTER XX
Mn. ANTHON was down in the kitchen
smoking his pipe, close in the chimney cor-
ne. It was a vulgar practice for a weal-
thy merchant, but he could afford it. And
Le did it decently, for he wasn't smoking
in the parlor.
Mrs. Deborah was seated with her knit-
ting work in the other corner. In the par-
lor above were the M'sses Eugenia and
Lydia. They were not alone. Mr. Augus-
tus Vanroy, Mr. Anthon's new partner, was
stated near Lydia; his friend Mr. Dennison
w    'ated close by Eugenia. Now neither
of he parties were unfriendly, yet each
couple were seated in opposite corners of
the room. And they were speaking low,
in whispers-perhaps telling each others
secrets. I'll let young folks guess what
they were talking about and go and see the
"old folks at home" in the kitchen.
"Mrs. Deborah!" said Mr. Anthon, as he
shook the ashes from his pipe and proceed-
sd to refill it for the third time-
"What do you think of the young folks
up stairs?"
Mrs. Deborah proceeded to raise her spec-
tasles from her nose, that she might see her
master, and laying down her knittingwork,
said:
"You know I 'ore the gals, they are good
creeteir, Mr. Anthon 3"

"Yes, fine girls-fine girls,but the young
d men, what of them, eh ?"
a "You want me to tell just what I think ?'
"Of course I do!"
"Well, I like that Mr. Dennison, he seems
to me like the bible, every varse you read
- you can understand.  e is a proper nice
young man. He speak plain out and haint
got no manners like as if he thought he was
above folks. And he looks folks right in
the eye when he talks to 'em, just as if ho
- wasn't afeard his eyes would call his tongue
a liar when it spoke !"
"But you don't speak of my partner, Mr.
Vanroy!" said Mr. Anthon as he picked up
a coal with a pair of tongs and lighted his
pipe.
"You want me to tell justwhat I think?"
"Of course I do, go on!"
"Wall now, don't be spunky about it Mr.
Anthon, but I don't like him, and I'm sorry
he's setting' up towards Miss Liddy, for I
like the gal and I'm awful afeard he'll make
her poor little heart ache yet. He speaks
too soft, like as if he had grease and 'lasses
in his mouth, and when he talks to anybody
his eyes keep a journeyin' 'round the room.
I like folks to look me right in the eyes
when they talk to me. I'm afeard that fel-
ler won't turn out no good !"
"But Mrs. Deborah he has the best of re-
commendations."      l
"I don't keer for any recommendations,
you asked me to tell you just what I think-
ed, and what I thinked I've said. I know,-
as my cousin Deacon Grant says, of himself,
that I'm a. poor weak sepulchre of clay
and prone to go astray as I travel on the
way, but ef that are seller don't turn out to
be a mean creeter, I'll keep house for you
all next year for nothin' I"
"Ah there's a ring at the door bell-go
up and see who is there ?"
"The old lady lowered her spectacles up-
on the well-worn saddle of her nose, laid
down her knitting work and travelhid.
In a moment she returned. She had a
letter in her hand.

"A woman Y" said Mr. Anthon in surprise.
ie was not in the habit of being bothered
by notes from ladies. (Now don't get mad
at me about that word "bother," ladies.)
"Yes," said Mrs Deborah, 'a female cree-
ter I think, 'cause she had a frock and bon-
net on. I couldn't see her face, she had her
veil down I She jist said-' Does Mr. An-
thon live here?' I said 'Yes m'm, he does!'
Then she said 'Giye him this note,' and off
she went. That's all!"
Mr. Anthon opened the note. Its con-
tents if not unpleasant, at least agitated
him for he dropped his pipe on the hearth,
where it was shivered into many pieces'
"La, suz !" there you've smashed your
pipe!" said Mrs. Deborah.
1cr master still gazed with an agitated
countenance upon the letter.
"It can't be !" he muttered.
"Yes you've drapped it at your feet !"
continued the old lady.
"I must go an- see him instantly?" mut-
terel Mr. Authon again. not heeding Mrs.
Deborah.
"Want yer hat and overcoat and injun
rubbers, I spouse , ef you're going' out ?"
"I-mnot going out, woman-for the Lord's
sake don't bother mc !" cried Mr. Anthon
as with the open letter in his hand he left
the room.
"Marcy's sakes! My gracious! 'Woman,'
he called me ! Not 'bother' him! What on
the airth can be the matter. He's a goin'
crazy, or else  -oh, that creeter that
brought the letter may be at the bottom o'

.       maybe that are man i8 agoin' to git married!
If he is I'll never speak to him aging! Ill
find out, see ef I don't !"
We'll leave Mrs. Deborah to her wonder-'
ings and follow flr. Anthon to the parlor.
When he went in he called to Vanroy.
"Will you step here a moment, Mr. Van-
roy-I have received a letter which con-
cerns odr firm, and it requires our mutual
attention I"
The young man excused himself to the
fair girl by whom he had been seated and
stepped over to where Mr. Anthon was

standing. The latter handed him the letter,
open, narrowly scanning his countenance as
he commenced reading it. For an instant
a flush of anger flew like lightning over his
face-then, he was calm as before, but he
bit his lips till the blood ran.
"Mr. Anthon !"said he in a low tone, "this
is the work of some infamous secret enemy.
The charge is false-tell me how it came
into your hands ?"
"A veiled female left it here a few min-
utes since !"
"Some creature hired by an enemy who
either envies me my good fortune, or whom
I have offended-some would-be rival either
in my love or prosperity !"
"But who could you have offended here?
Lydia never has received marked attentions
from any one else !"
"True Sir. there is some mystery wnich I
cannot unravel. But rest assured that the
charge is false. I am no deceiver-you
have vouchers for my character which no
man can doubt-pray let me look elosely at
this letter, let me keep it till morning, I
may discover a clue to the hand-writing
from among letters from my many corres-
pondents-oh that I could find the origina-
tor of so base a trick !"
"Keep the letter till morning!" said Mr.
Anthon-"bat I shall want it then, for I
must be satisfied in this matter !"
"You shall have it, Sir ! I hope you'll
not mention the matter to anybody else !"
"Certainly not-certainly not, I hope all
will he right !"
Mr. Anthon returned to the kitchen to fill
another pipe and to ponder.
Vanroy returned to the side of Lydia-
only to announce that sudden business call-
ed him out and then turned to excuse him-
self to Dennison and the other lady.
"It must be important business to call you
from us at such an early hour!" said Miss
Eugenia.
"It is, I regret to say !"
"Then, perhaps I may be of service let

The young men made their adieus, warm
ones too, they seemed to be, and departed.
"What business can call you out so sud-
denly and so late ?" asked Dennison of his
companion.
"Something too important to neglect !
You are aware that I have a mistress!"
"Yes, but you told me that influenced by
virtuous love you had cast her off! That
for Lydia's sake, as I for that of my angelic
Eugenia, you had cast aside your follies,

"So.I have, butt the vixen won't be cast

Anthon to-night !"
"Did you not provide for her when you
sent her away" -
"Of course, I did, like a man and a gent-
leman!"
"What has she written to him?"
"A letter which I have in my pocket,
stating that she has heard that I am court-
ing a protegee of his, and that if so she
wishes to inform him that I am not only a
villain and libertine, but am married al-

interview with her, which if he wishes he
can have by addressing her to the initials
which she signs in the letter !"
"Why Gus, this is a serious matter!"
"'ll make it serious; before I'm done with
it," muttered Vanroy to himself, then rais-
ing his tone, he said: "Yes, Dennisony it is
unpleasant. Can you advise me how to ar-
range it ?"
"Why, Gus, really I don't know what to'
do, or what to say !"
.      "Then my dear boy, the wisest thing is

"Yes, yes! Forgive me Gus, if an un-

Thus, for the night the two young men
separated.
CHAPTER XXL
AUousvus VANaoY stood once more in his
own room, and before him stood Laura, her
whom I described in the eleventh chapter,
his Heaen-wedded wife.
Tell me not, that no marriage is binding
save that which by some hollow-headed
hireling in sacerdotal garb is performed, or
that by some official who only knows his
duty by the fee it allows, is done. That
words uttered by one of these, and vows
made before witnesses who an hour thehce
may be stricken down with death, alone
render a marriage legal in the sight of Gen
and unto rn acceptable !
The vows made when a loving, confiding
woman unto a man vows like her to be
forevertrue and faithful, are as binding in
the eye of God, as those uttered before a
multitude, for ME is the witness, nIE who is
ALL JUST-ALL POWERFUL !
It is true that Augustus Vanroy was not
married to Laura according to the form pre-
scribed by mon, yet not the less was she his

wife in the eight of God. There in its little
criblay the sweet pledge which the Almighty
had given them as a proof of their marriage
-their innocent, beautiful boy. And base,
inhumanly heartless would be he who would
disown so binding a wedlock, desert so good
a wife, so fair a child! Yet to do both of
these did Augustus Vanroy seek.
As I said (when I commenced this chap-
ter,) he stood before Laura. The letter was
in hi. hand. He was pale as a drift of snow.
She was calm, as ealn as tue child which
lay asleep in its crib near where she was
standing. lie, too, was calm, but unnatur-
ally so ; like the atmosphere just before a
heavy storm breaks forth.
"Laura, did you write this letter ?" he
asked in a low tone, almost hoarse from his
endeavor to choke his anger.
"Yes, and delivered it, Gus !"
"Fiends of hell t You acknowledge it
then)"
"I do!"
"What did you mean by it? Why have
you thus trampled upon my nearest inter-
"Not hecanse I loved you, Gus ! That
love, by your neglect and cruelty, has been
almost crushed in my heart. I did it for
my child's sake-for the sake of that child
which never had been born had you not
promised to make it legitimate !"
"Curse the  -"
"Stop-stop Augustus Vanroy !    You
may curse me, but you shall not curse our
offspring ! I have watched you for weeks,
and I know all. I not only know that you
are trying to deceive and rob a good old
man of his fortune, but also that you are
trying to marry, and have already like a
villain-nay frown not. I mean it; like a
villain won the love of a warm-hearted

frame seemed to quiver with agitation.-
Soon with a voice low and gentle, almost
in a sobbing tone, he said:
"Laura, you are right, I have done wrong.
I do not ask you to forgive me, but I will
sacrifice all to make you happy ; this very
night we will leave Boston. I will fly from
her, from him, from all temptation-live
only for our child and you!1"
Long and earnestly did the woman scan
his features before she spoke. He looked
as earnestly as he spoke, but one who has
been once deceived doubts forever there-
after.
"You do not mean what you say, Gus !"
she said mournfully. "Once I would as
soon have doubted a minister from the pul-
pit, or disbelieved my own eyes as doubt
the smallest word you uttered-now I can-
not believe you. Oh Gus, how you have
altered since-since the time you lo-eed
me 1"
Tears started in her eyes when she said
this.
"Dear Laura I" said Yanroy, "I love you
still ; ambition has led me astray. I want-
ed to be rich, to be an aristocrat, to shine
brighter than the brightest, stand higher
than the highest, prouder than the haughti-
est of them all. In my ambition I forgot
you-"
"And that poor child. Your boy, Gus,
your boy-my beautiful baby !"
She bent over the crib and kissed tne bud-
ding lips of the sleeping cherub The scald-
ing tears which fell upon its rose-leaf cheek

heart inhales the first perfume of natural
affection, and lisped:

"Curse the infernal Dutch Jew, I must

carry me through this scrape ?" cried Van-
roy as with renewed energy he recommen-

Up went the window once more and out
came the head of the bearded Ishmael.
"Tousand duyvels ! I tell you come to-
morrow-what you want's ?"
"I have a message from Tullius Catlin,
for you t"
The name seemed to sound like magic on
the llebrew's ears.
"Dullius Gatlin, oh mine coot front ?
"Ycs--open the door quick, I'm in a hur-
ry 1"
"Oh di.en I come down soon ash directly,
quick like one gat !"'
In a few moments the door was opened
and Vanroy entered the house. After lock-
ing the door behind him thy Jew turned and
examined his visitor closely by the light of
the tallow candle which he held in his hand.
A strange looking creature was hhmael.
A diminutive body, lean ani dried up, was
capped by a very large head whichwas
bald and shone like one of the polished
skulls in Fowler's window. Ills little black
eyes peered out from under a cliff of grey
eyebrows-his features were as Jewish as
Iscariot's, the skin of his face looked like a
piece of smoked parchment, shrivelled into
wrinkles by the tire. his dress was shabby
and dirty.
"So, Mishter-you pe come from Dullius
Gatlin, eh vat rants my coot front?"
"lie wants nothing, I want something, he
told me if ever I needed aid, to come to you,
say but the word 'Hagar' and you would
help me!'"
The Jew started at the mention of the
name. but replied :
"Yesh, dat ish a coot word-Isuppose you
aced monish. Dat I lends on coot security !"

"No, I do not want money, I've more now
than I know what to dowith I I want your
assistance and I'm willing to pay for it,
roundly too!"
The Jew's eyes snapped as he heard pay
spoken of.
"Vat can I do for you, Mishter?"
"First I want a carriage and a driver who
can be depended on to keep a secret !"
"Dat can I get. Mine frent Cleeson keep
a coot one and trives for himself-he ish
one of us !",
"Then I want to know where I can put a
woman and child away for a day or two, till
we can arrange matters to get them out of
the country, or out of my way in sonicm an-
ner. Some family on whom we can depend.
or some tavern in the country, where they
will tell her all I want them to tell her and

"You ish in troiihle mit dis woman?

"Well to be brief, for I'm in a hurry.

Anthon as he watched the receeding form
of his partner.
Yes, one of TmiE "nice young men" was
Mr. Augustus Vanroy.
When, according to his appointment, Van-
roy met Dennison, the latter as usual re-
ceived him with manly cordiality.
"What news, this morning, Gus ?" he
asked.
"Nothing particular, only I've been up

she'd change her mind, I concluded to take

"So then all is settled now ?"
"Yes, I am safe-I advised Mr. Anthon
to write to his annonymous correspondent.

will be considered a hoax, and all will
blow over. The girls will never know any-

CHAPTER XXIV.
"I'vE brought something home to show
you, my sweet wife," said Charles Brennon
on the evening of the day on which he was
permitted to draw a prize in the lottery.
"What is it, dear Charles !" said the lady
smiling as only fond woman can smile.
"Look at these." he answered, exhibiting
a case of jewels.
"Oh goodness, how brilliant, how beau-
tiful !" she cried. "Why they are dia-
nmonds "
"Certainly-is it not a magnificent set.
Ear-rings, a bracelet, a finger ring worth
alone $500, a necklace of pearl, emerald,
turquoise and diamond interspersed, and a
pin-the whole se  is valued at $5000 !"
"Indeed ! How brilliant will the lady
that wears them appear when at a ball or
evening party, she appearsin a well lighted
room !"
"She will indeed. She is very beautiful,
but these ornaments will add to her beauty,
queenly as she now is."
"Do I know her ?"
"Yes, quite intimately. You and her
were school-girls together-she is married,
and is one of the best of wives."
"Who can it be? Do tell me Charles i"

"Well, in this case I acknowledge an ex-

"Will you get angry if I tell you that this
lady loves me very much ?"
"No, but I won t believe you."
'That she kissed me this very morning."
"Charles!"
x        "That I kissed her back, and told her that
I loved her."
"Charles this a cruel jest-you are only
trying to tease me."
"I was never more serious in my life,.
Mary-it is true-but now, now don't let a
tear till your eyes. I'll show you the lady's
portrait, if you won't cry !"
"Well show it to me,.I want to see her."
Mrs. Brennon's voice was not quite so
kind and sweet as usual when she said this,
and her face did not wear its ever-radiant'
hue of gladness. But when her husband
led her before the mirror and pointing to
her the reflection of her own beautiful face,
and kissing her fondly said, "that is the
lady who kissed me, whom  I kissed in re-
turn, and whom I love ;" she could not
help smiling.
T"ou cruel rogue," she said, "I didn't
know what to make of you, you acted so
seriously. But the jewels, who do they be-
long to ?"
"To you,,my own dear wife."
"To me, Charles? Surely father cannot
have made inc such a present ?"
"No, he has never seen them. I bought
them for you."
"You, Charles? Why whereon earth did
you get the money? You surely have not
gone in debt to make me such a costly and
unnecessary gift?"
"No, I paid cash for them?"
"Charles, please explain. There is some
mystery in this."
"None at all dear Mary-you remember
the lottery tickets ?"
"Yes and they-"
"Drew a prize of ten thousand dollars for
me. I have used a part of this money to
k       buy these jewels which will so become youl"

replied in a subdued, sad, but firm tone.
"Never wear them, Mary? Why but now
you admired them so much, and seemed to
envy the lady who was to possess them."
"I did, do still admire them ; they are
very beautiful, but I repeat my husband,
that I can never wear them."
"'Why, dear Iarmy ?"
" because they have been purchased by
the proceeds of a wrong, an illegal specula-
tion. I would not dare to look father in
the face when I wore these."
"But he need never know that they were
the proceeds of a prize in the lottery."
"He knows, Charles, the precise amount
of your salary-lhe also knows that you
have no other means. How could you ac-
count for so rich, so extravagant a pur-
chase "
"Why tell him a distant relative has died
and left me money. I mean to invest the
rest in the business of the house if he will
let me."
"Charles, would you stoop to utter a
falsehood ?"
"Not exactly a wilful falsehood, my dear
wife, but this would not be such. It is only
a harmless deceit, a white fib, you know."
"I know no difference in untruths,
Charles. All are black to me. You know
how I abhor deceit. You have changed if
you do not."
"I am not changed, Mary ; but I have
this money. Fortune has smiled upon me
and it would seem wrong to scorn favors so
seldom bestowed."
"I wish she had frowned, rather than
smiled upon you, Charles-I would rather
share a cot in poverty with you and labor
by your'side, than live in a palace on means
gained by such a way as this was. Charles,
cannot you return the money ?"
"Not when more than half of it is spent
to buy for you this present!"
"Will they not take back the jewels and
refund the money ?"
"No, dear Mary-it is a maxim in trade
never to retract or back out from a good

"No, father is too kind-hearted to do that.
While he condemns a fault, he isever ready

Brennon was about to reply, but ere he
could do so, Mr. Brent who using a famil-
iarity excusable in a father-in-law, had en-
tered the front door, without knocking,
come into the room.
Charles would have closed or removed
the jewel case, but he had no time to do so.
Mr. Bri nt's eye fell upon them as they lay
open on the table.
"ey day, what have you got here. clil-
dren ?" he said. "Why on my word they're
brilliants! who do these costly gew-gaws
belong to ?"
Brennon was about to speak, but his
wife pure as she was beautiful, and sensitive
to his honor, spoke first.
'My kind husband is trying to persuade!
me to accept them dear, father!"
"l'oh-poh-he cannot atlord such pre-
sents. Why these jewels are worth more
than a year's salary-yes two of 'em 1" he
added, as he again examined them. "He
could never pay for them in the world, and

you not to go in debt -"
"But father, these are already paid for. I
got them for my Mary. not to add to her
beauty, but to let the world see she has
a husband who loves her and who does not
wish to see her outrivalled in splendor by

'Pa.J for them !" said the old gentleman,

son-in-law: "Paid for them-Charles, how
much did they cost?"
"Five thousand dollars, Sir !"

"And pray where did you get five thou-

The old gentleman's brow clouded as he
asked the question. Perchance suspicions
of broken trust flashed through his brain.
"Dear father, I will explain !" said the
young wife.
"No, Mary, mine has been the wrong, let
me also suffer the humiliation of making
the explanation !" said Charles, blushing as
red as carnation.

selves ?"
"You have, father, but on this occasion
I was sorely tempted-I wanted to make
my Mary a bridal present worthy of her,
and for a few shillings, I have been enabled
to do so, and have now nearly four thousand
dollars in hand which I thought would be
useful in your business, especially as even
Wall street now groans under a pressure
for money ."
"Never a cent of money so gained should
go into my business, Sir !" said the old
man sternly.
"Dear father,"-and a soft hand was
gently laid upon his arm, and a pair of
tearful blue eyes looked up into his, and
a pair of ruby lips quivered over their pearly
petals, like the leaves of the red-i ose in the
morning  breeze-"Dear Father forgive

ANoTHER week has passed in our story.
Let us see what changes time has worked.
First we will pay a visit to the rooms of Mr.
Tullius Catlin. lie is not there-but Con-
stance Morley is. Is she altered? Yes.-.
Her cheeks glow with 'a rosier, healthier
hue. The sallow pallor produced by her
constant labor as she bent over her sewing
work, has vanished. The eyes red and dim
by late work by a glimmering candle, are
bright and clear as drops of ocean-water
sparkling in a seashell's rosy bosom. She
has had time to arrange her glossy hair.
Her dress, though still plain, is more neat
and richer than that she wore before. And
look, as she sits at the writing table, a dia-
niend ring glitters upon a finger of the
hand in which she holds her pen. She has
piued in her writing and seems to be re-
garding the jewelled circlet of gold intent-
ly. Hark-she speaks. Let us listen to
her thoughts.
"He must love m    she murmurs. "lis
never-varying kindness, this costly present.
so delicately given too, all go to prove it.
I-(shc sighed softly as she spoke)-I do
not lore him, but he-Seems so sad and lone-
ly that I pity him. I wish I could make
him happy! He ought to be happy-he
seems so good, he has every luxury that
boundless wealth can command, it is strange
that he should be unhappy!"
She hd not heard a noiseless step whtca
approached over the heavy Brussels car.

pt---she did not know that the words
audibly uttered in her revery had been
overheard and that too by him of whom
she was speaking. Therefore it was that
she started almost to her feet and blushed
to her very brow as she heard himin a low
sad tone say :
"Why is it so strange, Miss Constanco,
that I who am alone in a world which is
made up of deceit and hypocrisy, should be
unhappy?"
"I did not know that you were near me,
Sir !" said Constance, so confused and agi-
tated that she could scarcely speak I
"I did not intend to be a listener, fair
lady, but my ear is quick to catch the sweet
sounds of sympathy--I heard enough to
convince me that you were speaking of mc.
I could not interrupt you !"
"Oh sir, I was only thanking you in my
heart for this beautiful ring-but it is too
rich a gift, for a poor girl like me, to wear!"
"Poor, Miss Morley? Oh that all your
sex were rich as you are-rich alone in
your purity of heart, your goodness, your
noble nature? All the gold in California
cannot gild defects, cannot brighten or res-
tore the lustre of tarnished virtue-cannot
make a heartless woman lovely. You are
rich-rich enough to awaken envy in many
a city belle who gazes on your loveliness;
rich enough in your goodness and innocence
to wim and deserve the worshipping love of
the noblest in our land !"
"Oh Mr. Catlin, this is flattery!',
"No, Constance; excuse me, Mmi Morley,
I mean-I never stoop to flattery. You
have already seen enough of me to know
that candor is a part of my nature!"
"I acknowledge that, Sir-but I do not
feel myself worthy of so great a compliment
as that which you have paid me!"
"The meritorious are always modest ! I
have watched you closely-each day has
made me more sensible of your merit. But
I-will not intrude on you any further just
now, for I have business, and you have sev-
eral letters to answer for me1"
After Catlin left, lid she at once hasten
to write those letters?  No / She still

gazed on the glittering ring which bound
her finger, gaed upon it as we can imagine
Eve gazed on the forbidden fruit-and with
a sigh she murmured :
"I am sure he loves me ! But I do not
love him, I only pity him because he is ald
and lonely !
Poor girl she did not know her own heart.
Nor.did she dream what an arch-fiend, what
a consummate hypocrite, what a vice-hap-
tised, sin-soaked villain her supposed benie-
factfor was."
What did he say after he left her? Chuck-
ling in his devilish glee, he muttered, "Ive
got her fast now. The bait is taken. It is
but one step from sympathy to love, and
gratitude has lifted her over that. She is
safe. In a few days I shall be revenged for
the insult her father gave me-I shall revel
in bliss which would tempt a saint to for-
swear his hopes of heaven, and shall add
another to my list of victories, another to
my roll of victims. Yes, Constance Morley,
you soon shall be mine, soul and body !
Thus ends one chapter of a week of Ti'me's
rapid change in our story. Now for a
glance at the same week's work elsewhere
among our Dramatis persona.
CHAPTER XXVI.
CArTN and Grab were seated in the office
of the latter. Grab as usual, occupied two
chairs-the smoke of one of Springsteel '
prime native made Habana's curled up
from his lips, and he looked as satisfied as
if all his gold had not been washed in the
tears of countless victims to his thieving
arts.
"We've made a good week's work, net-
ted about $60,000, clear of expenses !" he
said.
"Pretty fair, rather above middling !"
said Catlin, "but we've got matters in a line
which will treble our profits. Who do
you think I saw buying a ticket in James

back office this morning-a wealthy mer
chant. who till now has been down dn u
tremendously,.one of our bitterest opposers!'
"I don't know who it can be?"
"Guess !"-
"For the life of me I cannot. I expect i
is some old codger that you have roped in!'
"No-lhe has roped himself in! What d
you think of Mr. Brent?"
"What, Charles Brennon's father-in-law?'
"The self-same individual
"Why I thought he was so opposed to i
that we had to let Brennon win a prize t(
keep him in hand!"
"Yes, and so it was, but I've an idea thai
our letting Chiarley Brennon draw a prize
has had something to do with this matter
I've not seen Charley yet, to find out, butI
can almost account for the sudden con-
version of the old gent. He sneaked in as
if he felt afraid some one would know he
didn't go there for exchange."
"Well,.it is singular-you said well, I
think, when you told me that the prize
wouldn't bme lost on Brennon !"
"1 wouldn't be surprised if we made fifty
or sixty thousand dollars out of them now.
They are both hooked. James has the num-
ber of the ticket which the old man bought,
checked, and we're going to let him draw
a small prize first to fasten the hook in his
gills. These merchants are so used to large
speculations, that when we get them once
into the humor, they don't know where to
stop!"
"That's a fact. By the way, Tullius,
have you heard from Vanroy, lately I"
"Yes, I received a letter this morning!"
"How is lie getting on
"Famously! le has got two of the best
Boston hotel keepers to act as private
agents for us--has got a dozen young bucks
of the ton who have more money than brains,
to try their luck; and three or four clerks
in big houses to do the same. He has got
the cashier of a bank in State street to try
his hand. I shall be sure that he draws a
good prize right on the start I"
"Well, act on your own judgment-you
have a carte blanche, on know! flow is

- Vanroy getting on in the matrimonial ape-
s culation you told me of?"
"   '"It is all in afair way, but a woman came
near spoiling his chance there !"
"How?"
t "Well, through jealousy. Gus, for somo-
"time had been keeping her as the Mor-
o mons do. as a spiritual wife--he was
not legally married to her and tried to cast
" her off, so that he would be free to court
and marry the young heiress he is after.
t The woman found out his plans, and wrote
o to old Anthon, the partner of Gus, that he
was married and had a baby I"
t "How on earth did Gus get out of that ?"
"Persuaded the old man that it was all a
. lie, got the woman off out of town, siooth-
ed the matter over, and now all is as clear
as day before him  Gus is a smart boy,
an honor to our profession !"
"He isn't anything else! Is that Glendye
matter all settled ?"
"Yes, and Glendye is on his way to Cal-
ifornia; we must be moie careful whom wb
choose for agents. This new law is cursed
tight I"
"It would be if policemen, jurors, and
judges could'nt be bribed? we are safe from
the law as long as our golden spectacles
can be worn on the nose of justice !"
"That is true !"replied Catlin, "and nearly
all of our New York officials have weak
eyes when there is a chance of getting gold
spectacles to wear !  If I had a hundred
thousand to spare, I would not fear to com-
mit every crime in the calendar, I could get
clear as easy as a trout from a pin-hook.
Money is all that a man wants to walk over
the upper-crust with in New York."
"Yes, and we've got our share, but this
cursed law forces us to disgorge too much
of our winnings."
"Well, it can't be helped. Police officers
and judges get small salaries and they must
live, you know!"

situation of Laura, the poor cast-off mistress
of Vanroy. Deceived by the plausible villain,
she had agreed to leave Boston, she wasj
even happy when seated in the carriage by
his side, holding her cherished child in her,
arms, she passed from Boston at the still
midnight hour. She had not noticed that,
two men sat on the driver's box, nor did she
even note the direction in which they start-
ed. In fact the last would have been near-
ly impossible. The night was dark and the
blinds of the carriage were closed, as Van-
roy kindly suggested to k~ep the cold night
air from his darling child.
The carriage drove on quite rapidly for
about two hours, perhaps a little more, and
then drew up before a small stone house
which was almost entirely shaded and hid-
den from the view of travellers on the road,
by a grove of elms. The carriage door open-
ed, and the little Jew pawn-broker who
opened it said:
"We are here at mine leetle country seat.
mishter Vanroy-you and your coot lady
are varee welcome to make it your home so
long ash you lik 8 "a
"Who is that man ?" asked Laura, in a
whisper, as she clasped her sleeping boy in
her arms and wound the shawl close around
his tiny form, ready to step from the car-
riage.
"A friend-I'll tell you as soa as we get
into the house !"
lint half satisfied, dreading something, she
knew not what, she entered the house. Pas-
sing through a gateway, she heard the gate
,wing heavily on its hinges, and thought
she heard a key turned behind them. They
had to pause, while Ishinael their guide,
knocked at the door.  Ishmael spoke in a
tongue unknown to her and was in a mo-
ment or two, answered from within in a
similar language. The door then opened
and two persons appeared. The oldest, a
dried-up looking old woman, quite meanly
apparelled, held a light in her hand. Half
shrinking behind her, as she observed stran-
gers, stood a beautiful young girl, evidently
of Jewish origin. She was probably fifteen
or sixteen years of age, that sweet age

when beauty is in its bud and like the open-
ing rose is most lovely. As Ishmael step-
ped forward, he said to the elder woman,
"Repecca-I have brought some frent
vich viii sojourn-a leetle viles vith us!"
Then turning to Laura and Vanroy he add-
ed. "Dish, mine coot frents is mine ho'hsli
keeper and dere is mine daughter, Miriam
Come here -Miriam, mine child-dish is
Mishter and Mishtress Vanroy-you must
make dem comfortable, you and Repecca
vile they sthay mit us 1"
"Yes, dear father f" said the young girl,
coming forward and imprinting a kiss with
her cherry-red lips upon his wrinkled brow.
The party passed on through a dark, chil-
ly hall, and entered a room which contrast-
ed strangely with the rough and gloomy
appearance outside of the house. It was
elegantly furnished. A glowing fire burned
in the grate. Wealth had been lavishly ex-
pended in furniture, paintings and works of
art. As soon as Vanroy and Laura were
seated, the housekeeper asked if she should
prepare some refreshnnent for them. This
was declined.
"Oh what a dear, sweet little baby !" sail
Miriam, as the mother took the shawl and
wrappers from around her child.  And the
Jewish maiden bent on one knee and kissed
the sleeping cherub.
"I have one friend in this house, at least.
thought Laura, as with a mother's pride she
noticed the action.
"If your housekeeper will show my lady
the room which she is to occupy, I will ac-
company them for a moment !" said Vanroy
to Ishmael-"I have to return to the city
to night l"
"To-night, Augustus?"
"Yes, love, that I may hurry through
my business and be the sooner ready to go
with you as we have arranged !"
"Then let me see you alone a few mo-
mentsbefore you go. I have much to say
to you!-"
The okl housekeeper took alight and led
the way to a chamber, as neatly furuished
as the parlor they had just left. Placing the

light on the centre table, she left the
alone.
"Augustus!" said Laura, after she ha
laid her child down on the couch, and car
fully covered it-" Augustus, are you no
deceiving me in some way "
"So help me heaven, I'm  not !" he r
plied.
"Then why is it that you did not tak
me to the tavern in a village near Worces
ter, that you spoke of?"
"Because after I went out I thought o
this country seat which belongs to the old
man we saw below. He is a friend to whom
I had letters of introduction, an ExchangE
broker of immense wealth, and when I men
tioned our case was but too happy to doc
me a favor "
"Ifyou go to the city again to-night, when
will I see you again ?"
"By the day after to-morrow, my love !"
'Will you then be ready to go South with
me ?"

'I hope so, Laura-I will arrange my
business as hastily as possible !" -
"Do, for this will be a gloomy place to
ine. I do not like the looks of that Jew,
nor of his housekeeper. But his daughter
seems to be a kind, amiable creature!1"
"And no doubt she is. She will be pleas-
ant company to you, and prevent you feel-
ing lonesome !"
"Dear Gus, I would be lonesome in the
company of angels if you were not there i"
"Well love-one good-night kiss, and then
I must hasten back !'-
"Oh do nit go till morning, Gus i"
"I must my dear. I must be in the city
very early '"
"Then go, God bless you-hurry back, I
shall count the minutes till you come I"
A burning kiss and an embrace- fond on
one side but cold as hypocrisy on the other,
and he was gone. The mother knelt by the
bedside whereon her sleeping babe lay and
prayed for him who was even then so base-
ly deceiving her.

While Vanroy was conversing with Laura
ap stairs, Ishmael in anotherapartment was
giving Rebecca her orders in regard to the

m prisoner. There were three in the room,
and the third one was not Miriam. He'
d was a huge, stupid looking man,who though
- he seemed to listen to the orders given, hard
t ly seemed capable of understanding them.
The orders were to supply Laura with every
comfort, but at all hazards to prevent her
leaving the house or the enclosure which sur-
e rounded it. She was not to be informed
- that she was a prisoner, and he gave minute
directions in regard to the excuses to ho
f made to keep her within doors. As a last
resort, he left some powders, which though
they would not destroy life, would throw her
on a sick-bed if taken with her'food. Hav-
. ing concluded these directions he rejoined
Vanroy and they at once re-entered the car-
riage.
"Have you arranged everything'for her
safe-keeping ?" asked Vanroy as they drove
off.
"Yesh Mister Vanroy-she is safe ash my
monish, or ash mine own taughter'"
"Your daughter is very beautiful !" said
Vanroy
" Yeah-so was her modder pefore her!"
replied the Jew, sighing heavily. "Yesh
Miriam is a coot gal, she knows nothing of
the wont and its padness, I never lets her
go from de place at all!"
For some time they went along in silence,,
each occupied with their own thoughts.
Ishmael was the first to speak.
"I dink you told me to-night Mister Van-
roy dat if dish lady and der child is sent
from de country so dat no more dey troubles
you, you will give five thousand dollare de
night dat you marry de rich gal, eh ?"
"Yes, I said so and will do it i"
"Um-den I tinks a leetle whiles. I got
some ver coot frents in Yarmany, some dat
is high in der government, I tinks maybe if
I can send her dere dey will never give her
a passport to come back !"
"But no harm must befall her.'-
"Oh no, dere ish no danger of dat. Eve-
rypody knows old Ishmael has coot heart!"
Again both sunk back into silence which
was not again broken till they reached the

CHAPTER XXX.
CoNSTANcE MlORLEY was at nor post. en
gaged in writing as usual. She had now
been nearly two weeks in the employ o
Mr. Catlin, who to her had ever been obse-
quiously polite. He seemed ever sad and
low spirited. He required but very little
labor at her hands. IIer copying never oc-
cupied her more than an hour or so, yet hcr
salary was very liberal. What wonder then,
that in so short a time he should have awa-
kened in her young heart a deep and a dan-
gerous interest. Remember- that she who
had in her early youth known comfort and
even affluence, had since then been steeped
in poverty, that she had toiled early and
late, by the dim light of the midnight taper
and by the cheerless rays of the rising su
to earn the bare necessaries of life, and now
by an apparently kind hand which seemed
to ask no recompense except the power to
do good, no reward which could raise a
blush upon the cheek of virtue, she found
herself independent and comfortable, able
to support her only surviving parent in
ease. Then wonder not, that all unknown
to herself, gratitude had given way to a
stronger feeling, that in the fulness of her
young, passionate nature, she loeed her sup-
Josed benefactor.

I said in the commencement of this chap-
ter that she was as usual at her post. It
was morning, nine or ten o'clock. At thej
same table, on the opposite side, Mr. Catlin
was also engaged in writing. He laid down
his pen after using it a short time, and sigh-
ed deeply. She raised her eyes-they met
his, for he was gazing at her. His look
was so sad that she could not help noticing
it, could not refrain from speaking.
"Are you not well this morning, Mr. Cat-
lin?" she asked..
"As well as usual. Miss Constance 1" he
replied, sighing a un.
"You seem so sari, Mr. Catlin Y"
"What have I to make me gay?"
"You have nothing to make you sad, Mr.
Catlin. You possess wealth and wealth is
power ! Power used for good, as you use
it, must be happiness. I almost envied you
when I saw the gleam of grateful pleasure
light up that old gentleman's countenance
when you promised to assist him yesterday I"
'Yet happiness does not consist in wealth,
fair lady. Wealth may in a measure con-
duce to it, but wealth cannot make a wint-
cry world warm. It cannot restore foliage
to the blasted tree, it cannot give life to the
wilted flower. There is but one thing which
can make a true heart happy I"
"And what is tpat, Mr. Catlin ?"
it"Love, Constance, ivzl Love though
it dwells in the narrow cell of a prison, or
within the contracted hounds of a peasant's
cot, will gild life, when gold clings like a
leaden weight upon the heart and clogs the
wheels of joy. H-ow then can one all unlov-
ed like myself, he happy I"
"Oh Sir, you are not unloved !"
"Then as if conscious of having commit-
ted an unmaidenly impropriety both in the
warmth of her tone and looks, the face of
Constance became crimson with blushes.
Catlin observed, he saw he had struck the
right chord, and he dared not let it die away
for he might never recall the sound again.
"XNot unloved ?" he said-" Oh Con-
stance if I could hope for love where I in
secret have planted the seeds of my first af-
fection, oh then, I could hope yet to be

happy. Forgive me Constance, I can con-
ceal it no longer, I love you-yqu only I
From the hour when we first met, I have
felt in my heart emotions to which it before
was a stranger. I have gazed upon your
beauty as the flower ever turning toward
the sun drinks in its brightness. I have
listened to the silvery tones of yeur voice
and wished that you might speak forever.
Oh Constance, is there a hope that my love
will be returned. You can make me happy
-you can make me miserable-I My fate,
my very life is in your hands! Oh speak,
dearest, and end my suspense !"
While he made this passionate appeal,
he drew near to her, suddenly he dropped
on his knee at her feet and clasping her
small white hands in his, looked up implor-
ingly in her face, in her liquid eyes, await-
ing, by his looks beseeching a reply.
She did not withdraw her hands-she
bowed her head upon his shoulder and wept.
She did not chide him when he kissed the
tears from her cheek ; she did not reprove
him when his arm stole around her slender
waist ; she did not frown' when bolder still
he planted burning kisses on her red lips.
Though she spoke not, he was answered.
When he again more calmly seated him-
self by her side, he took her hand in his and-
said:
"Dear Constance, the world is no longer
a wilderness to me, I am happy!"
"If Ican make you happy, then I shall
be happy!" she murmured.
Then as reason resumed its sway, as she
emerged from the confusion into which his
sudden  and  vehement declaration had
thrown her, Constance began to feel the in-
equality of Catlin's circumstances and her
own.
"Why should you, who are wealthy,
graced in form and strong in intellect, love
a penniless girl like me I" she said. "You
can win and wear the brightest, richest
jewel in the land I For your own sake for-
get poor Constance, seek some beautiful
heiress, some mate more worthy of you !"
"Sooner would I seek a bride within the

replied.
"Oh Constance, till now I have concealed
the love which has been burning like a
quenchless fire in my breast.
* The cold in clime are cold in blood,
Their love can scarce deserve the name ;
But stxa is like the larasflood
Which burns in Etna's breast of flame.'
I think not of wealth-your worth in
goodness, in purity, in affection, in beauty,
outweighs all the gold on earth. The only
jewels I ask, are your eyes, brightened with
the holy dew of love !"
Again he clasped her to his breast.
Again his hot lips were glowed to hers.
Her heaving bosom, her trembling form,
her flushed cheeks, her eyes languidly bril-
liant, like violets overladened with dew,
her short-drawn sighs, betokened her feel-
ings,feelings new to her, emotions as strange
as they were indiscribable. The first feel-
ings of a young beast bursting from the

WHEN Catlin left Grab, he hastened to
his own apartnint. Constance was there.
In every scene, describing her as she was, I
have painted her beautiful, but now, her
face glowing with the rosy sun-light of
happiness, her eyes sparkling with th holy
dew of pure joy, every vein thrillimg with
pleasure which she did not try to conceal,
her bosom throbbing with the waxc-like
ieaviugs of first love, she was glornously
beautiful.
When Catlin pressed her passionately to
his bosom, she lid not repulse himt ; when
his burning lips met hers she did not :hrwik
from his tirery kisses, she knew no danger,
her heart and soul was centred imi one wild
mad thought, it was love, even to Wlora-
lion! When a true woman loves for the
first time, her love is like the zeal of a new
convert-it is all faith all con/idener with
her. And never cai she, if once deceived,
love again as she has (lone. After his fond
embrace and a few passionate caresses. Cat-

methodically proceeded to "business."
"Dear Constance," he said, " since we
both love, our union need not be delayed!
I have no parents to consult, I have only an
uncle to please, and he is in Carolina. I
would like to please him in my choice for

inherit his good-will and property than to
see it go into the hands of strangers !"
"Why do you not write him and ask his
consent !"
"It would take three weeks to get an
answer, and dear Constance, I could never
wait so long! To see you here daily, so

"Oh so soon, dear Tullius? Why sue
haste. I have not even consulted my moth
eC'?"
"She will not object I"
"Oh no, I do not fear that, but then
there are many preparations," said th
blushing girl, "which I must make. Ihave
clothes to make!"
"I will charter a whole dress-makers es

"Oh what need of such haste, or of such
extravagant expense, dear Tullius! I need

can dress me richly-it is for your warm,
good heart ; your noble, generous nature-

"Then sweet girl do not delay my hap-

CHAPTER XXXIV
Two days had passed since Vanroy left
Laura and her child at Ishmael's country
residence. The first day passed off rather
wearily, though Miriam the lovely daughter
of the Jew, passed most of it in her comu-
pany, toying with the beautiful child and
trying to amuse her with her simple talk.
Miriam was evidently a child of Nature.
Her father had guarded her with nistr
like care from all contact with the world.
She had never been abroad except in his
company and very few visitors, and those
only of his own selection, ever visited the
house. Never was veiled and cloistered
nun guarded more watchfully than she.
On the morning of the second day, Laura
accompanied by Miriam descended to the
garden, which surrounded by a very high
stone wall, like a prison yard, lay back of
the house. It was beautifully arranged and
kept in constant order by the coarse and
repulsive looking man, who was described
in the twentyseventh chapter. Miriam had
attended to many of the flowers, for liko
most young girls she was very fond of them.

CHAPTER XXXV.
. Fr was evening. Mary Brennon was seat-

ITE VTCrTMs OF LOIrR
ed in her little sitting room, waiting for
her husband to return from his business.
Tea was ready. but he waslater than usual.
Was it a wonder that she looked at the
clock and sighed? That young wife was
thinking how early her husband had hur-
ried home during the first-days of their
marriage-how,almost breathless from haste
he came it and clasping her fondly to his
bosom imprinting fervent kisses on her lips
and brow. And she sighed because she
felt that a change was coining over him,
that the spring-time of love was losing its
freshest, sweetest flowers.
So it is too often with man, somefincs
with woman. They love madly, wildly, at
first, are hungry in their attachment, but
then like one who his partakei of a hearty
meal, they are satisfied, their appetite cloys
and their hunger is appeased-love gives
way to indifference and at last it becomes
utter forgetfulness. Like the sti'camraised
in a mountain ravine by a sudden shower,
the torrent is for a brief time resistless and
impetous-like it when the shower is over,
the source is dried up by the sun and the
stream is no more.
" He used always to be home by six1"
murmured Mrs. B.-" it is now after seven,
nearly eight. Charles Is changing-he is
neglectfulI"
Her face before so sad, suddenly lighted
up with joy, now, for she heard his well-
known step at the door. She rose and hur-
ried to the door. expecting the kiss and
inbrace which he had always been so ready
to give, But she was disappointed when
he entered the rioon, for he merely remark-
as lie took of' his hat, " You needn't have
waited tea for me. Mary. I dined qnite late
with a friend!" '
No kiss-no kind word, no fond look.
tier heart felt chiled-she felt stifled-she
could scarcely'restrain a rising tear.
"A cup of tea will do you good, dear
Charles!" she murmured.
"No, I don't like tea, especially after
I've been drinking wine I"l he replied, cast-
himself drowsily lown on the sofa.
Mary had noticed that his face was flushed

when he came in, and thought that it way
caused by his rapid walking.  But whet
she bent over him to fix the cushion of the
sofa under his head, she detected from his
breath the cause of the flush, and for the
first time the fear came upon her that she
had linked hir fate with one who might be-
come a drunkard ! In a few nonents lie
was asleep, snoring as loud as a Mississippi

fiding, pure young wife, registered again:-.t

At the same hour, while Laura was speed-
ing toward the vessel where she expected to
meet Vanroy, the latter was seated iii the
parlor of Mr. Anthon, whispering low-toned
words of love from his perjured lips to Lyd-
ia. And with all the coniding innocence
peculiar to a maiden who knows but little
of the world, the young girl wif t willing
ears listened to him. lie was her first love,

sonified-all riobleness, nl generosity, all
goodness-and then she thought he twas so

The sails of the vessel were spread-bu
a single rope held her to the wharf, th

tugged at the rope like an oat-fed hors

comes !''
. Yes, bimeby, when I gets across to Hol-
land, den I waits for him !" said the skip-
per, with a coarse laugh.
Then she understood all, she realised
that she had been once     more  basely
deceived. She sank down helpless and
fainting on the deck.' The rough skipper
had heart enough left in his callous frame
to feel some pity, and he had her and the
child carried below and placed in the best
state-room in the cabin.
Meantime his craft was dashing out of
the bay with flowing sheets, her spars buck-
ling and bending under the force of a vale
wvhtich as she drew out from the land in-
reused in strength. When they discharged
their pilot, they had to take in top-gallant
sails and an hour later they were under close-

i reefed top-sails, the courses hauled up and
d siugly furled. The old skipper's face wore
a sad and gloomy look as he stood near the
t helm, now glancing at the compass, then at
e his creaking spars and then to windward
- where the clear, cold-looking sky told him
t that the gale had hut just commenced to
e show its strength.
Four hours later. The gale was at its
s height. The old craft, now only under her
s topsails and the fore-storm-stay-sail,plunged

1 anxious, were on deck, the old skipper had
- thrown away his pipe-he felt that he had
m more to do than to smoke just then. Where
was Laura ? Sleeping, amidst that turmoil
of fearful elements? .Nh. She could not
sleep but it wds not the storm that seemed
terrible to her-it was the thought that hi'
for whom she had perilled, lost all that was
worth living for, had deserted her and the
sweet child which all unknowing of its de-
solation slept upon her bosom. Had it not
been for that child, she would have leaped
into the foaming yeast of waters and perish-
ed, but for him she lived, for him, her angel
child, she felt that love, all-enduring and
eternal which only a mother can feel.
Ten hours later. The night had passed
away, but light made the storm appear even
more terrible. The topmasts and upper
yards had been carried away. The sea rose
in great blue mountains, snow-crested with
foam. One moment the staggering bark
would be lifted high upon their ragged
heads, then down,'down in the deep gulfs
below she.would plunge, seeming as if she
never would rise again.
Muttering now a curse and then a prayer.
the Dutch skipper stood by the binnacle.
glancing often at his compass. The wind
had chopped around from the North West
and now was nearly East,blowing in toward
the shore. Rock-bound as our coast is, the
mariner dreads the gale when he cannot
spread canvass enough to carry him clear
of it.

and the reverend minister did iot neglect
it. And warmed into enthusiasm by its
potency, lie said many things and made
many an un-ministerial joke which it is not
necessary for me inhere to repeat.
And now we'll leave the new married
couple to themselves for a while, and look

after some others of our dramatis per-
sonne.
CIIAPTER XXXVIII.
Tnsm: is a fine, four-story brick house not
man feet from the St. Nicholas hotel on
Broadlway. It looks like a private residence.
A silver plate on the door contains the name
of the -puted  owner or resident. The
window blinds, though, are shut close, the
place is silent as if no one dwelt there, or
so would it seem to the mere passer-by.
Reader, there is a mystery about that
house. Let us, you and me, go in and see
.if We cannot unravel it. How will we get
in ? Riig the bell of course. The door
opens, a negro servant dressed in livery ap-j
peart.
"Is Mr. Hern at home?" we ask.
'Yes, sal. but berry much engaged I'
replied Ethiopia.' It de gemplemen will
gib me deir card I'll see if cey can be admit-
ted."
" I left my card-case at home, but here
is a halt-eagle, that will do will it not?"
You're berry good, Sahl, but I hab my
strict orders."
"I know that--I've the pass word to the

Well, we are in, reader. Up we go. At
the head of the first light of stairs is a door.
It is locked inside. I knock, it is partially
opened. I whisper a pass-word in the ear
of the janitor--we pass in. We are in a
room legantly furnished. Rosewood tables
here and there contain periodicals and news-
papers.  A  sideboard, marble-topped, is
loaded with decanters of wine and liquors.
The glittering glases are before us, shall
we smile?
We had better not! Those liquors are
drugged! But there is no fun going on in

this apartment,, let us go higher. We try
another door-it too is guarded but our
countersign )SCs us. We enter a room
rather differently furnished. A sideboard
with its tempting display of liquors is there,
so is a roulette wheel. A faro table is
spread at the head of the room, before it
stand a numerous crowd. Who are they ?
IU it possible that we see a Judge there who
hut yesterday sent a poor wretch to prison
for stealing a piece of meat from the market
when his wife and children were starving in
a cellar on Orange street. It cannot be-
he is a Judge and administers justice. Ie
knows the law by heart and could repeat
the statute against gambling, verbatim.
Yet he is there, gambling.
Who is that tine-looking old gentleman by
his side. lie has not a nervous look, but
as lie stakes his cash on the turn of a card
his hand shakes like an aspen leaf in a gale.
lie is betting heavily. And, wonder not, for
it is true, that man is Mr. Brent. He com-
menced with the lottery, he is now trying
his hand at another kind of gambling.-
Where will he end? Read on, you will prob-
ably find out.
CHAPTER XXXIX.
ANOTHER wedding party. Lames, you
see I'm in the marrying mood just now,
don't, please don't take advantage of my
wealkness.
The party consisted of Mr. Anthon, Mr.
Newbury ana his two daughters and )enni-
son and Vanroy. They occupied two car-
riages, which took them to the Railrbad
Depot near the United States Hotel. I had
nearly forgotten to mention that Mrs. Deb--
orah had also accompanied them to thfe cars.
She was not going on, but she wished to see
her "pets" safely oft:.   '
"May the Lord o' marcy blese you ana

to concoct their devilish plans, and see if we
cannot get into better company, for worse
we cannot be in. Pplicy and lottery deal-
hrs are so far below a common till-thief that
it would be an insult to the last class to
name them in the same breath.
Yet our judges, lawyers, policemen and
merchants go hand in glove with them, and
treat them as if they were gentlemen-
heaven save the mark?
CHAPTER XL.
IT was morning, and Mr. Brent was in his
counting room before nine o'clock, a thing
very unusual with him. his face was pale,
but his eyes looked red and inflamed, as it
he had either beei up late the night before,
or had been dissipating.  He paced the
room to and fro, after clasping his hands
nervously together, and muttering to him-
self.
Over six thousand dollars in one night,
gone too at a gambling table ! What led
me there? Why did I go ? I was invited
as a friend and a gentleman to merely look
at the game. I looked at it, others were
winning, I thought I could, and now I'm
ont over six thousand dollars? And I've
spent nearly a thousand dollars for lottery
tickets since I drew a prize. But luck must
change. I wish Charley would come with
the key of the safe, I must win in my next
trial. I'll buy tickets, they're better than
faro, at any rate I wont spend money so fast
in them. Aft-there's Charley I"
Charles lBrennon too looked worn-out and
jaded as he entered the counting room. But
he noticed the looks of his father-in-law in
a moment and asked:
"Are you unwell father? You look ill I"
"I'm not well my boy. I've spent a bad
night-a bad night. I slept but little !"
'You show it, Sir. had you not better
go home and let me send for Doctor Root 7"
No-no my boy, I don't need medicine,
. or at least none of that kind. Besides I
aven't time to be dick. I've business this

morning, important business ! You've the
the key of the safe, have you not?2"
"Yes, father."
"Then get Inc a thousand dollars and a'-
that we'll go up to the Bank Coffee house
and try sonic of that old brandy, it will do
me good I tkink."
Charles Brennon stood for a moment in
astonishment. Long as he had known Mr.
Brent, he   never before knew   him  to
either go into, or propose going into a
liquor saloon. IIe had always said it was
no place for a business man. lie had warn-
ed Charles not to go to such places and now
lie invited him there.  What a change
And what was the cause of it?    -
It was that he had taken the first step in
crime when he had bought his first lottery
ticket. He had then commenced to gamble
-and the first step having been taken, the
road was open and he knew not whcre to
stop.
Thatfirst step when man or woman de-
viates from the right road, walks aside from
the chalk-line of morality and honor, is a
fearful one! It is worse than-a leap from a
precipice which at once destroys life, flor it
takes from life all that is im it worth pos-
sessing. Thus, you will ever see, those who
have taken the one step, dash madly on
over the turn-pike of crime, never pausing
until they reach the gallows, or are plunged
in the irretrievable gulf of misery.
Charles Brennon had taken that step, Mr.
Brent had taken that step, Mr. Montrose had
taken it, and destruction, utter ruin could
be the only result. It is as useless to at-
tempt to reform a gambler, as it is to rea-
son with a drunken man, or try to 'set a
river on fire with a pretty girl's greasy curl
papers.
And was it only upon themselves that
they were bringing ruin? No-it was up-
on their innocent famili s! Upon the good
and pure "loved ones at home."
Why do I write these line, what did good
and honorable men pass laws against gam-
blers and lottery dealers for?  To make
money?    No i It was to protect the inno.
cent who suffer from the crimes of the gull-

Another day had opened, fair and beauti-
ful, the sun shone bright upon the spires of
Trinity Church. The of'iciating pastor and
his clerk were in the sacristy waiting the
arrival of a wedding party. It was ncar
noon, and at twelve the ceremony was to
come oif which would unite Augustus Van-
roy to Lydia Newbury and her sister to Mr.
Dennison.
As the hands upon the clock above poin
ted to within five minutes, the carriage con
taining the bridal party and their friends,
drew up before the lofty edifice.   The
groomsmen hastened to assist the ladies out.
At that moment another carriage, contain
ing a pallid female with one or two persomrs
else, was approaching up Broadway. It ar-
rived opposite the Church and at that mo-
ment Augustus Vanroy was leading his be-
trothed across the portals of the - sacred
building. Then, from the lips of the pale
creature in the coach arose a wild shriek,
but he did not heed it, did not seem to hear
it, for he passed on.
But the carriage stopped.

" Sultaitiaied? What do you mean?

" Tullius you do not doubt me !"
" No, but I doubt that your love will con-

Tullius why so cruelly jest with a fond
se'n-'itive heart ?"
" Im not jesting Madam !''
" Madam ? Why ever before you have
called me Constance, your dear Constance.

call me Madam ?"

"Not your wife ?" she gasped-" surely

so Niss Monley you may as well take a final
farewell of your temporary husband !"
She did not shriek or faint, or weep, as
the heroines of novels do, on such occasions.
Her tall trm seemed to dilate, her eyer to
enlrrge, and her red lips to pale as if frost
had touched them. She looked a moment
in his face and when she saw the villain
quail before her earnest gaze, she tlt satis-
fled of his guilt, of her own unintentional
guilt and of her irrecoverable disgrace.-
And then, while her eyes told him how sud-
den is the change from fervent love to bit-
ter hate, she spoke in a low whisper,
Wretch, why have you so wronged me1"
"To revenge the wrong your father cast
.upon me. Now go, courtezan, go and mia-

burning coals and the end of which is in the

Catlin, like the riven oak I recognise my
blasted hopes at a flash. "You may now
triumph' in less than an hour fear for thyself

Then while her eyes flashed and her form
seemed still to grow larger and more beau-
tiful she turned and left him.

laugh he cast himself back upon an otto-

whose duty it is to execute the law.
Not disheartened but more determined than
ever, she left the office vowing vengeince.-
And when an angered wumun vows vein-

Nio, yon was too ;-low for her. A man
with money aid imudnce, and you have
plenty of both at yrr conrininl, can do
anything in this city. You ought to have

"I could not, Mr. Giab. It would have
startled your nerves to hear the voice and

your own eyes had seen but two or three
days before depart in a ship bound ont  a

as if she hai arisen fromi the grave and I
was utterly unmanned. It would have uinr-
manned Catlin, and he is the nv.r, him-

"Did you name me ?" asked the veritable

"There, I said he was the devil !" said
Vanroy.
"Well, and what the devil is up? You

"Good reason to-the fat's in the fire-
Vanroy is in a scrape-his marriage is bro-
ken olf and he will undoubtedly be exposed
and that will break up our Boston business
which had just begun to be p:oiitable .'
" The marriage broken off, how ?
Vanroy again detailed the facts as he had
already done, to Catlin.
Well," said the latter, after listening
quietly to the narration, this match being
broken off is rather hard for Vanroy, but
the matter won't affect our lottery business
in Boston !"
" Why not? I can see nothing but ruin
in it. Their exposure will ruin Vanroy,
there.
" Yes, were it imade, but do you think
they would he so foolish as to make it ? It
would but recoil upon themselves and ren-
der them sulbjeet to ridicule for being so
weak as to be so easily duped. There is
nothing so dreaded in this world as ridi-
cule. They will be glad to preserve their
reputations by avoiding any exposure, an(
all that we have to do is to place another
agent there in the place of Mr. Vanroy, who
can successfully attend to thei business
which has already conmmenced. Van can
be sent south or west to a new scene of
operations !"
" Well, Catlin, you always take things
cool and seem ready for any emergency !"
" Of course, and that is the grand secret
of success in life ! 1 have to-dry resigned

Jolly glass of wine. I do not often imbibe,

Grab produced the wine and over it the
villainous trio not only recounted past ad-
ventures but formed fresh plans for the
future. Catlin stated that one love off his
hands, he had only to turn his arts towards'
Miss Montrose to make another conquest-
while Grab said he cared nothing for love
but all for money, and didn't see why he
couldn't make it as well as a Beach or a

as honorable as theirs.
A jolly time they had of it, and soon in
the oblivious and dreamy vapors of wine
and cigars they forgot the dangers which
menaced them.
C1IAPTER~ XLVI.
CoNSTANCe MoRLEY, when she left the
office where justice should be administered,
passed stern and stately up Broadway, un-
heeding the admiring glances which many
a promenader cast upon her magnificient
figure. She was studying how to be re-
venged upon her dastardly seducer. Poor
and powerless in friends, knowing that she
had wealth to war with, she was studying
what course to pursue for upon revenge,
and revenge alone, she tvas bent.
She did not notice that she was closely
followed by a man who was dressed in the
height of fashon, though not exactly fop-pish-
ly. He was alittle above the medium height,
rather well made up, had eyes as dark as
the door of night, heavy black whiskers
and moustache. His face was pale but not
intellectual. The animal evidently pre-
dominated in his nature. Yet he was one
that would not pass unnoticed in a crowd.
There was a kind of bold, fierce expression
in his countenance that would induce one
who did not understand human nature to
set him down as a brave man. Yet have I
often, and most often seen calm, quiet
looking men, who until aroused looked
meek as lambs, the most dangerous in a
fray, ready to lead the way where such
men as him I have first described dare not
go. And I may as well tell the reader at
once that in him I only describe a person
whom I know in this city. The last time I
saw him it was in the dress circle of Bur-
ton's theatre, with a lady by his side who
was not only a faithless wife, but one who
had deceived and wronged the truest friend
she ever had on earth. She started, paled
and trembled when she met my eye, for she
knew that I knew all her history. She

when the coward raised his eyes and met
my steady gaze he cowered like a hound
ben-aatih the eye of its master, like a sheep-
stealing log that knows it ought to lie shot.
After a moment's conversatitoi the wretch-
ed, rnisguiided Wonian, whose beauty anl
intelett tnce so peerless, deserved a better
fae, arose and accompanied her paramour
from  the place. I spoke not, moved iint.

And of this, if po-sib)le, he intended to take
n-ivantage to gain an introduction, for
alraly his i-yes gloated upon her splendid
tignrt.
'Tihey passed on up Broadway until they

Yes lady, I acknowledge to an impro-
priety-I have followed you for several
blocks, because you seemed unhappy and in

trouble, I felt interested and wished if poss-

She looked at him earnestly, seemed to
study for a moment what reply to make and
then said.
"Sir, how can you feel interested in a
stranger?"
" Lady, when a woman is in distress, ev-
ery true man is a friend and a brother to
her. If I can serve you, do not, consider mue
a stranger ! Trust in me
Sir, you are kind, but I know not whom
to trust, I have been receivedd, basely de-

In whom can a wronged and betrayed wo-
man trust but her ('od."
" or further happiness perhaps none-
but for revenge of past injuries--
" Al Sir, that is it-you have spoken the
word, revenge. reenge is all I seek. Oh
if you are bold enough-but no, I should not
a=k you, who look so bold and good to in-
cur risk or danger for me a poor friendless

Lady, do not deem me a stranger. If
you have been wronged, I dare to, anl will

Aih, Sir, it is a sad but a brief one-per-
hiaps when you have heard it, you will des-
pise me!"
Never lady, one so beautiful as you
could do no wrong in my eyes !"'
She looked at him  as he uttered those
words, as if she would read his soul through.

The villain started and turned pale at

But in a moment he recovered his presence

but what of her ?"
"Who seduced, ruined and then abandon-

" I do not know, but as I have nothing to
tho with the person you speak of; I am won-
dering why you ask !"
Because, Mr. Catlin, I abhor deceit. I
am satisfied that you, through a mock-mar-
riage effected the ruin of a pure, noble-
hearted young girl. 'Ihat you have mur-

his door, he entered his mortgaged house.
A frown was on his brow, and it darkened
as his lovely daughter sprung forward with

meet him  with a kiss. Ie repulsed her

ment I"
Now reader for a new character in our
book, one however that is tiue, the picture
of a millionaire banker, whom you can
sometimes see rolling down Wall street in
his elegant carriage. here is his portrait.
Seated in a large easy chair, cushioned
and backed with velvet, his feet pilloved on
an ottoman, you will observe a man atleast
sixty years of age, though by his foppish
dress he attempts to appear younger.
His face was piple by the use of wines
and liquors, his frame swelled, bloated and
gouty from over-living. Ile wore a wig to
conceal his baldness and Ballard's hair dye
had been called into requisition to dye his
eyebriows and whiskers. his redldeiled eyes,
thick lips. and sensual expression betoken-
ed his disposition. There he sat, robed in
a stuffed and quilted morning gown of flow-
ered satin, his gouty feet slippered in vel-
vet, the personification of a wealthy old
roue whose race of pleasure had become a
painful tottering wreck toward the grave.
The servant wlhoi we saw below, enter-
ed and with a low obeisance handed his
master the card Constance had sent up.
A deeper flush caine over the red face of
the millionaire as ie read the name-a
chuckle gurgled out from his thick lips !
"By the jolly God of Love-~it's her-I
thought she'd accept my last offer, she's I
a magnificent woman !"  Higgins, how do
I look to-day, ei?"
"Fine, sir, uncommonly fine!"
"'Well, send my valet to me, instantly,

" Perot, help me to my dressing room.
You must use all your skill to dress me
splendidly as soon as possible-you must
make me look killingly handsome !''
" Oui, Messieur !" replied the valet.  It
shall be done tout suite, et toute parfai-
ment. I shall make you look no more zan
thirty-five years, by my honuarel"
lWith evident pain, assisted by the valet,
the millionaire hobbled from the room.
And now I am about to do what for the
world I would not, were a lady in the case,
enter a dressing room. I did, once, by the
foolish miisiireetion of a stupid servant, get
into a lady's dressing roots, but my stay
was brik', I can tell you-I knew in an in-
stait that I was in the wrong box. Ih/iear'd
a faint sereafn and sew-xoINa! I left
quicker than a rocket from a little boy's
hand on a Fourth of July night.
The dressing room we are about to visit
is that of our millionaire. Look at it. See
the cosmetics which load yonder table ;
paints, white, red and black-here a wig,
there a false set of teeth ; here pads for the
legs, there pals to fill out the chest--back
and front braces. supporters, &amp;c. All kids
of pomades, complexion renovators. Mir-
rors surround the room. A lounge beside
every bath. And yet how miserablelhe mil-
lionaire who can command all these things,
when compared with one of our penniless
boys who can earn but a scanty living,whose
cheeks are made rosy by exercise, but who
with strong limbs, free from diseases, can
leap into the flashing lake or river, and
there in the God-given bath refresh himself
after the hour of labor is over.
Yes, see that old libertine hobble in on
his gouty legs and between a grunt and a
groan mutter :
D-n this gout, it will be the death of
me yet. Perot, prepare me a Regenerva-
ting bath; a la Ciprica, quick !"

Some of these are kept under the sign of

There at a feew small toots back for very

and bao-ntote woman stands, ready to tii

" we sh.dl See what we shall si-,''
The next door to the entrance of this
shady retreat, is but a private entrance to
the same building- Upon a silver plate is
neatly engraved a name, but it is not the
real name of either the owner or the occu-

pant. We will call the name Delorme for
the nonce. Before this door a carriage
stops-the driver and footman are liveried.
The carriage door is opened, a lady close-
ly veiled descends and though it is the
dusk of evening, we tteed not for a moment
hesitate, from her form and hr graceful
carriage. to say who it is, for Constance
Morby cannot disguise herself from one
w ho has -eei her once.
The footmtan by her diretion, rung the
door bell.  After a momut's deilty the
door was opened, and by the fair widow
whom we have seen behind the little bar.
Madamtn  Delorme, I believe?' said (on-
stance, entering.
" That is my tane, Molam, but I know
not whotm I have the honor to receive, or
the occasion of this visit I",
" The pasword I give," 'whispered Cn-
staei, "is *'contraband ;'' mum' the coui-

" True, l will give my orders !"
The marriage moved away, and the two
kemals etered a parlor whih was sepera-
ted from the bar we have spoken of only by
a door. After they got in, and Constance
took a seat profferretl by the widow, she
raised her veil.
The latter looked as if she had expected
to recognize an old acquaintance. But she
was evidently disappointed.

word ?"
That I cannot reveal at present. You
do not know me, but you do know one Tul-
/ius Coffin?
The widow started as if an adder had
stung her to the heart. First her face was
pale as snow, then red as fire.
"Know    him--um'?" she cried-"yes,
well do I know the cursed villain who he'
trayed my poor husband and caused him to

die in a felons cell where even I could not
go to console him in his dying hour I If you
are a friend of his, go, go from beneath my
roof before I curse you as I have done
him!"
"Be calm Madame Delorme, I am not his
friend, rather am I his deadliest foe. In me
you behold one of his last victims. I have
come here to seek aid to ruin and destroy
him. I could kill him, but that will be no
vengeance to me; I want him to die as your
husband died-in a prison cell. I want to
see him live as long as life and niserq meatn
te same thing! You need not doubt me, I
an a woman--women never deceive each
other except when influenced by envy or
jealousy. No one loves me, I love no one--
you cannot, must not doubt me !"
"I do not Madam ; by what name may I
address you ?"
Call me Constance, nothing else I"
"I will: how can I serve you?"
"You have a house which is used -s a ren.
dezvous by a class of bold and reckless men,
who thinking that the world owes them a
living, (1o not scruple to take it 1"
" How did you find it out?"
"Because I accidentally heard a conver-
sation which occurred between Catlin and
one of your visitors, a man who himself
seems to dislike  Catlin while he fears
himl "
Do you know his name'
"I do not. He is a slender, dark-com-
lrlexioned man, with a large scar on his brow
,"tending down upon his right cheek."
"Ah-I think I know this man. Come
to the little wicket in the door here, and see
if you can recognize hint among the men
who are setting in onder room. You need
not fear, they cannot see us here I"
Constance did as she was desired, looking
through a narrow aperture made by a slide
in the door.
"Yes, he is there' is the man nearest
the window, who is emoking a cigar and
reading a newspaper 1" she said.
"I thought as much. That Lattson is a
deep villain, but I think Catlin has got
ahead of him about the proceeds of some

haul. I heard him swear vengeance my-
self!"
"Can we trust him?"
"Yes, if he has a motive. He can be in-
flenced by money, or by a desire for re-
venge !"
"I have money, plenty of it, and will
not spare it. Can you call hint in, that I
may have an interview with him?"
"Yes, if you desire it, but do not trust
him too far, Lattson, is like all other vil-
lains, used to crime, liable to  e used by
the highest bidder f''
"I will bid as high as any one-bring
him in1"
In a few moments the man who combined
in himself the qualities of burglar, forger,
and counterfeiter, entered the aparttett.
He looked at Constance distrustfully. for
he knew at a glance that she was a lady,
and not one d~a class with whom he had
been used to associate. She observed his
embarrassment and at once proceeded to
remove it.
You need not fear me, Mr. Lattson,"
she said, "I have cotie to get you to do
me a favor, and ant willing to reward you
for it !"
Any thing in reason, Madame!  What
do you want done ?"
" You know   a fellow named Tullius
Catlin ?"
"D-n him, yes Madame!        Forgive
me for swearing, but he is a bloody thief,
without honor !"
You know him to be a thief?"
"Y Yes, Madam, and a receiver too-that's
worse, forlhe hasn't the courage to crack a
crib on his own hook !"
"Can you prove it so that I can get him
into States Prison, if I pay you well ?''
"Why you see Ma'am, this peaching is
rather aoainst my principle, besides if I did,
I mignt get myself into trouble, for since
you know my name so will you probably
know that I'm on a lay once in a while

Mr. JtDsON (Ned Buntline) enjoys a world-wide celebrity for the masterly
character of his writings, and the fidelity with which he delineates the varied
hases of Metropolitan life.  lie wields a bold, dashing, vigorous pen, and
plunges at once into his subjects with all the gallant impetuosity of a knight spur-
rin; his brave charger into battle.  With intelleetual energies rarely equalled, a
quick, congrehensive eye, and an unrivalled faculty for pm'iaug (and delineating
objects as they strike him, he brings before his readers scenes and characters, not
with thle faint pencil of flotiance, but witb the vivid pen of Truth In his present
work, " The B'hoys of New York," Mr. JunsoN hias suinnoned to his aid all
that masterly talent for which lhe is so pre-tltiileilt, andi the result is----a free, full,
and graphic picture of lifecroonifl~fgic .b'1lys ; their muanners, customs, habits and
peculiarities, and all the lights and shades of ]'/ec life.  No other work in this
country (The Mysteries and Miseries of New York, perhaps, excepted) presents
so perfect a series of Metropolitan scenes and characters, and the fidelity with
which they arc rendered will at once strike every reader familiar with the person-
r ges and localities, of every variety and stamp, of the Metropolis of the Empire
'tate.  In its pages will be found the striking likenesses of the B'hoys - the gay
and dashing G'hals ; the haaitaes of gambling hells ; fashionable saloons, and their
(frequenters ; the broken down Iole, and, in fioe, every phase of city life, peu-1
rliarities and manners.

IN the course of this great Romance, SUE, (while he adds much to the interest of the1
plot,) exposes the causes which drive so many
THOUSANDS OF THE MEN OF PARIS TO GAMBLING, ROBBERY,
AND TIlE GALLEY, AND THE WOMEN TO PROS.-
TiTUTION AND THE MORGUE.
While it is entirely free from any offensive thoughts or language, it unveils the terrible
social evils that are
GANGRENING THE VERY HEART OF THE FRENCH SOciEPy.
Never has genius conceived or described more interesting characters than those which im
part to this story the animation of real life. The bold, handsome, but cruel and licentious
('clonel do Plournel-the stern, frigid, jesuitical Cardinal-the lovely and virtuous daugh.
ter of the honest Linen Draper-the intrepid and worthy young Joiner-and the beau-
tiful but guilty Grts 4e, who receives in her white breast the ball aimed s  cr heroc
lover on the barricades-are all faithful types of the various classes in the metropolia of
Frar.ee.
So admirably written and full of interest, indeed, is this incomparable book, that all the
vigilance of the French spies and police has bccn unable to prevent the circulation of mi.
lions of copies in every department of France.
-pE T MY5TERIES or Tu  PEOILE, or the lbstory of a Pruietarian Family, from the
Earliest Ages to the Present Time. Tram ,ated from the French of Eugene Sue, Member
of the Legislative Assembly of France -This Tale, which commenced in Jany., contains
one of the most striking pictures of serfdom ever drawn by human hand. The truth is
boldly anid fearlessly dehineated ; and all true friends of freedom and real philanthrop.'sts
mu-t admire the work and bless its author. The Times newspaper has endeavored V)
run down " The Mysteries of tne People," but when we assure our readers that it was this
tale which won for Eugene Sue his election as Member forl Paris in the beginning of May,
the fat alone will prove a sufficient refutation of the scandalous aspersions and malignant
falsehoods of that despot-loving journal."-Reynolds's Miscellany.

The Morning Star, in speaking of the late lamented Mr. CuarrS, says : "H
made himself thoroughly master of almost every incident in our Revolutionary
annals, and we have the result of his studies in all his deeply interesting novels-
His plots never outrage probability, the characters are nobly drawn, and his
familiarity with the 'time that tried men's souls,' enable him to introduce in
his works many episodes of the adventure and thrilling danger which E often
beset our forefathers in that perilous period. In a word, his novels are roman-
ces of our country's history, penned by an eloquent writer, whose patriotic
heart burned within him as he chronicled the achievements of his gallant fore-
fathers."

of the reckless Duval's unrivalled exploits. He sees the dismal, silent heath-the gold-
'aden traveler--the dashing Claude, borne like a whirl-wind by his fiery horse, foam-
flecked and bloody with spurring. He nears the sharp ring of the nistol-shot--sees a body
fall and a few minutes after, Duval canters carelessly away, to sperst his aeariy-won
gold upon wine and women.
