"CU'lTT," I said, do you wish to go and live with me?"I awaited her reply, thinking, "What a strange name she has!"-waited several seconds, for she ap- peared bashful, and held her head down in an embar- rassed way. "I guess so, ma'am." The words were issued in an undecided manner, as if she rather doubted whether the change would benefit her. "What is your surname-your last name? Cutup what?" -"Anything I can get a chance to." She blushed :  deeply when she had said this. "Spell your first name, child." She gave me a quick glance, and carefully commenced: "C-u-t-u-p. I know you think 'tis a funny one; so do H don't like it." "Well, dear, I think you would rather live with me than to live here." ' "Oh! it don't make much difference, though I don't suppose 'tis very respectable for a big, strong girl like me to be willing to remain in a poor-house." "My dear"- Sheoflushed carnation, and piteously said, a  ,     r"              (9) ' , .    10        INTUITION. "How strange that sounds! nobody ever calls me that; my mother did, though, and my father, before he lost his money-he was so discouraged. A-ho!"It was a prolonged sigh, and from it I learned a tale of sorrow. Her long, silken lashes-were weighted with unshed tears. I placed my arm around- her, drawing her gently towards me. I smoothed the tresses of her beautiful hair. She trembled and dropped her head. I spoke tenderly, saying- "Cutty, I think you will do very nicely for me-to come and help take care of my little kitchen. - I am quite alone, excepting when I have visitors, and think you could do all, save the washing and nice ironing, very well; then black Jennie, who lives next door, comes in twice a week to do some cooking; the rest, I believe, could be managed between you and I." "Well, I don't care much," she answered, in a de- spairing kind of way which I could not understand; one so young, so healthy, left an orphan in the pauper- house; I supposed, of course, she would be delighted at the prospect of a better home. She was very pale, with now and then darting color in her cheeks, large brown eyes, pretty brown hair, and had it not been for the ex- traordinary breadth of her mouth, I should have pro- nounced her really handsome. I went in after talking with Cutup awhile longer, and met the overseer's wife, questioning her concerning the girl. "Strange child of her age,'but very smart, and, I judge, very affectionate, if we can reach her true na- ture."   -             INTUITION.         " "How old is she, Mrs. Daley?"  a "I think near thirteen ; yes, that's it--thirteen some- time in the summer." "Does she work well?" "Very, very." "Capable about house?" "Very, and very quick." "Neat, Mrs. Daley?" "O yes ; almost too neat." "Well, every child has some bad traits; what are hers, please?" "Really, madam," answered the overseer's wife, with a peculiar expression coming in her face, "she's the very queerest girl on religion you ever heard of. She can repeat the Bible, I believe, half through; and will argue according to her teachings. She needs some- body, I thhik, to dissuade her from the ideas she has got of hell and eternal punishment. I will tell you, madam, what the trouble is : she lost her father first-I've heard the story from a reliable person. Her father was doing very well about five years ago, at work in Prince & Houghtol's counting-room." "Bookkeeper?" "Yes, bookkeeper; ;he was well educated, and, I'm told, a very well disposed person. His wife was high- spirited, and I guess rather extravagant: one of these girls, they say, brought up to do nothing. Well, she had two children--John and this Cutup; I believe Cutup was her mother's middle name; really a queer name to give a child. Matters went on smooth enough   12        INTUITION. until these two little ones were born, when Mrs. Stone thought she must have a nurse for the babies, and a servant to do the work. By the way, Mr. Stone had got a cottage half paid for, and was struggling hard to pay for the rest; his salary was good, and he might just as well as not, if she had done her part; but no, she must live genteel. I've heard he said nothing, but kept getting more and more discouraged, until he com- menced to drink a little--just enough to drown his dis- appointment, I expect. That made her mad, and so there was now and then a muss, you know, which made him all the worse. It's an old story-the girl's educa- tion was the fault: she had been taught to live genteelly at home, to despise work, think she must keep two ser- vants certainly, though she war healthy and strong. I might as well make the tale brief, madam. He drank harder and harder, until he was a perfect sot, and at last went into consumption and died ; if you will believe it, his wife took to drink, too; they say remorse was killing her, and she couldn't bear it; and her father, who had a new wife, just cast her away from his door; then she grew desperate, and drank worse and worse until she got a fever, and died also, leaving those two children. Her father wouldn't have anything to do with them, and they were brought here-and such trouble as we had with that Johnny! my husband has whipped him half to death for his capers time and time again, and it never did one particle of good. Oh! he did try us terribly! Cutup loved her brother very dearly, and used to cry over him and talk so strange to   ,. .:ijEX        INTUITION.         13 him. One night after dark, they were sitting out on the back door stone, and I overheard them holding such anl odd conversation. Cutup says, ' I can't encourage you, Johnny, you are so naturally and totally depraved, and we've got to bear the iniquities of our parents, you know. There's no hope for mother and father-we might as well go to hell, too. We can't help it, 'twas fore-ordained that they weren't of the elect. " "Who told her these things, Mrs. Daley?" "She said her Sabbath-school teacher, and that an old lady who lives opposite here told her a good deal. She asks the strangest questions; I never heard of such a child-never--and you will think so. She is a queer chick-that is, in her way. As for bad traits, she hasn't any, really---nlot that I can call ugly or ma- licious." I was interested in the girl more than I confessed. I could conceive at once of her true nature. She was, indeed, smarter than Mrs. Daley's comprehension could define. She was idylic, sensitive, inquiring, with mar- velous intuition. Discouraged, despairing-and well she might be, for she was desolate, I knew after Mrs. Daley told me that Johnny died in jail for setting fire to a gentleman's barn, where he had gone to live; a vin- dictive act, to be sure; but people who knew said his master was cruel to him in the extreme. A She isn't good for anything to us," said the woman, as the peroration of her conversation; " she would work with anybody who would sort of help her, and in- dulge her a little in her love of flowers, painting pic-  "        INTUITION. tures, and the like. I think, madam, Cutup was born for a lady, though she will work well; don't misunder- stand me "--I thought the overseeress a little alarmed lest she had impressed me too strongly with the girl's poetical genius to convince me she would be the practi- cal help I was in search of; so she added hastily, "don't mistake me ; Cutup is a servant worth having."9 The name " servant" fell upon my ears as wholly in- applicable to the orphan. I saw her through the open door. She was standing by the side of a beautiful white goat, which was feeding in the yard, upon the early spring grass. I watched her as she stooped to caress the creature. Her hair, loosened by the wind, escaped her round comb and fell backwards over her bare shoulders like bronze; it fairly sparkled in the sunlight. The love she gave the animal wakened thought, no doubt, in her lonely soul, for a rich color came into her cheeks ; her eyes brightened ; she smiled, displaying two rows of white, even teeth. Oh i what a charm lay in that smile! Her calico dress dropped off one round, white shoulder. She was kneeling with her arms around the goat's neck. I believe a good artist would have given two 'years of his existence to have painted her then and there. 6"Hark!" said Mrs. Daley; c" she is saying something queer to that animal. Hark! d'ye hear it? "No," I replied; " what was it?" "She says, 'Nanny, I wish I could be you-I shouldn't worry about mother and Johnny being in such torment all the time.'    INTUITION.         15 I looked at her with a deep pity; this child, with the brilliance of beauty and rich intellect encircling her, and such a bleak commencement of life! I arranged with Mrs. Daley to take Cutup froma the almnshouse on the-following day, The woman appeared quite relieved, for I verily believe she almost feared the anomalous nature of this orphan girl. When I passed through the yard I said- "Cutup, dear, I will come for you to-morrow. I think you and I will be very happy together. You must go to school. Mrs. Daley tells me you study every day, and that you are a good scholar by your own exertions." She flushed hot, and a pitiful tenderness canme in her voice. ' I want to learn, ma'am, but I cannot go to school with other girls." Believing it best not to hold argument with her at present, I bid her " good day," and went down the road thinking of her blameless, stainless life, crushed out by fear and hopelessness wrought of early teachings. Elo- quent to me was her plaint of despair, and I yearned to correct the mistake, awakening gladness in her soul for its staying darkness. My own gloom and uncertainty hlad been something like hers. The time came back, sweeping over me with great strength and vividness. I recalled that bleak day when I followed the black- plumed hearse through the fragrant aisles of pine, while the birds sang and the flowers blossomed; while the pitying breeze cooled my hot temples, and the blue   16         INTUITION. sky coaxed me to look up. The months came back- those months, weeks, days, of mourning, when memory gave me not the angel, but the loved dead form, lying in its satin house, shrouded in roses and japonicas. My soul never lifted itself towards truth, but lay beside the beautiful face growing gray with the hue of corrup- tion. I remembered how the man of God, cladI in his bishop's robe, walked towards the yawning grave, re- peating, "I know that my Redeemer liveth," and my response went fortlh- "Yes, my Redeemer liveth," but I did not appreciate His true life then. I echoed, "Yes, yes, He lives;" but He was so far away! Though I had been named Christian for years, I did not realize the nearness of Christ to the mourner. "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust." The first cruel clods fell. I heard, and, clutching my dress, seemed half smothered.  I whispered with straining eyes, and livid face, frozen tongue-"I know that my Redeemer liveth." I caught at the solace as a drown- ing man catches at the impotent straw. Did comfort come? Nature was black, the song-birds mocked me, heaven was vague, angels unreal, folding their wings, sitting within my life as the raven within the poet's. I thought,- "And from out that shadow my soul shall be lifted Nevermore, ah! nevermore!" I remembered how that petition sounded, "Our Father which art in heaven." I gasped, wailing, "My Father, what have you taken him for?" and the Heavenly Pa-   INTUITION.          17 rent answered nothing, that I could hear, for my ears were deaf-'they had not yet learned to listen. Morning came and went; noon blazed in the zenith; night folded her sable mantle down, but it mattered not to me. I begged upon my knees for peace, reconcilia- tion; the minister came and prayed with me; friends pitied, telling me I must be resigned. I tried to be--I thought I was: I was only mourning his loss. I read the Holy Book. "Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest." "' Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth." "In the world ye have tribu- lation." Well, I must bear, knowing it was all for my good, and wait the day of my death to understand fully the Divine wisdom. The inscrutable ways were past finding out. Other days dawned, other prayers as- cended, other nights came, other long watches, many wet pillows, ald open eyes straining themselves to pierce the darkness. Might he not pity the mother he adored, and come just once to assure me he was not in the grave, but living on in happiness? I lifted up my hands, exclaiming, "Cecil, Cecil, they say the dead never' come back; but pity, Oh! pity me, and tell me I shall see you again! Come just once--only for a sec- ond-that I may know you live!"   I plead until the silence grew awful, and then I craved death. Marius dreamed Atilla's bow was broken, and upon the same night Atilla died. Oh! that somebody would give me the prescience of my death! And then I shuddered for the consciousness of wick- edness. I strove to calm the cry. It grew louder and   18         INTUITION. louder.  "Give me some link between my dreadful present and immortality!"I took my Bible, and with eyes nearly blind from incessant weeping, searched. An angel called to 1Hagar, one spoke to Jacob in a dream. They were no manufactured spirits, for did not the apos- tles see Moses and Elias? ( The angel of the Lord descended from heaven and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it." I pondered. -I knew not how they saw them, but I believed God's law had never changed. Had the portal opened to allow these of old to pass through, then closed itself forever? Some nat- ural law, though I could not explain, had caused angels to be seen and heard; might not I see and hear my Cecil?  The thought dropped into my soul with ex- quisite ecstacy. I seemed suddenly changed. Memory brought me something I once   heard Henry Ward Beecher say: "' There have been times in which I de- clare to you, heaven was more real than earth: in which my children that were gone spoke more plainly to me than my children that are with me." Precious assurance! should I ever find how it could be? A sooth- ing, as of my darling's own soft hands, swept over and through me.  In that moment I commenced to study God. On the morrow I went to the grave. I remembered when those women sought at the tomb for Christ, and when they were afraid and bowed down their faces, how the angels spoke to them, saying, "Why seek ye the living among the dead?  He is not here but is riser." "O grave, where is thy victory!"Had not Cecil also   a          INTUITION.          19 risen? I tarried long and meditatively. If angels ever had appeared to- mortals, could they not now as well? If man or woman ever had held intercourse with spirits, might not I? If the ancients possessed the comfort of conversing with the loved lost, why not we? Would some theologians call me insane because I questioned the propriety of clasping my Cecil to my arms? Though invisible, did not my darling go with me, follow me, precede me, watch me, smiling at my eccentricities, and saddened at my disappointlments? I thought of all the wise and great men in the past: Soc- rates, Plato, and later minds whose belief in the guid- ance of angels had been handed down even to us of the nineteenth century. I pondered long and deeply. In- tuition forced upon my soul a comfort hitherto disre- garded through early education, and later clinging to it, because reason and philosophy had slept-becaus6 no dear one had gone to the terra incognito. I had taught my Cecil, the spirit goes to God who gave it, and rest content with the belief; but I never thought of the true nearness of God. I also had been taught He is every- where. While I tarried, a mood possessed me. My mind seemed to break loose front material thraldom, assert- ing its distinct freedom, awakening to new powers. Scales seemed to fall from my eyes, and the parchment of nature was unrolled to my view. I was so absorbed I forgot external surroundings, and soft footsteps has- tened near; precious hands laid themselves upon my hot brow, cooling it quickly ; lips met mine ; it was the    20        INTUITION. old whisper, tender beyond expression--"Mother!" Ah! had my soul so unfolded itself?   ' other!" ' Cecil!" Oh! how real!"tHe is not here, but has risen :" he had come from his summer home. Thoughl he had spoken but that one word, that name so precious to him, it was enough. The passionate craving of my soul had been filled. Intuition had done its work, and well. Doubt had fallen into the embrace of light. I walked away when I had been awakened from my soft and consecrating spell, feeling less alone; aye, I put out my hand to lead him as of old. So sudden had peace come, and yet so truly, I wanted to cry aloud to other mourners I was passing by- "The spirit world is not closed-- Thy sense is closed-Thy heart is dead."   CHAPTER II. "AST evening, Miss Phebe Wilberforce and her sister, Miss Hope Wilberforce, spent two hours with me. They are members of Rev. James Treat's church--have been for years. They spoke of their last visit-it was before Cecil died. Miss Phebe gave her sister a nudge which was intended for a sly one, but I saw it. Miss Hope looked quite frightened. I smiled, answering, "Yes, dear Cecil was here then, and made us very happy by his sunny nature. Do yoa remember, Miss Phebe, how he sang to you? and he played chess with you, Miss Hope." "Yes." The brief reply was launched forth, and both ladies gazed strangely at me ; quite as though I was insane or devoid of proper grief for my dead, for I smiled. The door-bell rang. It was Mr. Mackenzie, the affianced of Miss Hope-a forbidden lover, the villagers said, for old Mr. Wilberforce could not countenance the geltle- man's religious ideas, or ideas of religion. Miss Phebe was also shocked at her sister's choice. Mr. Mackenzie and I always had been at high dispute upon Bible mat- ters, and I was not surprised when he, quite abruptly, asked-- (21)   22         INTUITION. Mrs. Blake, what is your idea of the first chapter of Genesis?" I did not reply directly, and I saw Hope's pleasant face crimson as she glanced quickly towards Phebe, then at her lover. "Don't, please, -Henrique, you are always teasing Mrs. Blake." "No teasing, Hope; 'tis healthy to get an exchange of ideas. We should be isolated souls were it not for this commerce of conversation." "Well, then, let it be upon some scientific theme." "That's just what I'm at, Hope." "Science and religion do not agree, Henrique, you say." '"Perhaps Mrs. Blake can make them." I answered, "Mr. Mackenzie, I am not willing to dis- card the Bible for science." "What will you do, then?" he asked, moving his seat nearer me. "O dear!" sighed Phebe; "Henrique, I much rather go home than hear you advance your terrible ideas. Mrs. Blake, I tremble for him. Father says he is almost -shall I say it, Hen.?" "Yes, yes," answered the gentleman, smiling. "Well, almost an infidel." He laughed heartily, rubbing his hands together as though preparing for some very hard work. "Mrs. Blake," he said presently, with a roguish glance at his affianced, ' what do you think of Genesis first? do you believe it?"   :?    INTUITION.             23 I answered, "Moses evidently was mistaken. He is quite guilty of sins of omission." Henrique laughed. "I should say of commission, Mrs. Blake. He tells us this wonderful geological earth was made in six days." "Perhaps," I said, " the days were millions of years in length." "That will not help it, madam. Moses makes great mistakes. He tells us the very first created organic ex- istences were grass, herbs, and fruit trees." "Certainly," said Miss Phebe. "Prove it!" challenged Mr. Mackenzie. "The Bible says so, and of course it is right." "According," said Henrique, "to the keenest re- searches of our greatest minds, we had first a few very ordinary mosses, a few ,soft-bodied animals devoid of skeleton forms, and some marine insects." "Who's we?" asked Hope. "I speak generally, my dear." Turning to me he continued, " so you see, Mrs. Blake, we did not get fruit trees first, but something quite different: seaweed, shellfish, and polyparia. You know, do you not, what the lowest fossiliferous rocks yield?" I answerd by half interrogation, half assurance "Marine forms very low in the scale of existence?" "Yes, Mrs. Blake, and millions of years, according to the proof, must have elapsed before grass, herbs, and fruit trees could have existed." "Do not dispute the Bible, Henrique," plead Hope, in her quiet way.    24         INTUITION. "No; we only want to rectify Moses a little." Phebe nervously worked her crochet hook in and out. "What does the patriarch say of animals, Mrs. Blake?" "They were created on the fifth." "Yes ; and yet they are found as low in the rocks as vegetables; and vegetables, he says, were created on the third." "God created on the fifth," said Miss Hope, " fowls and every living creature that moveth--the great whales with all the rest; what a day's labor!" Mr. Mackenzie smiled, replying, "Yes, my dear, but He rested upon the seventh, you know-tthat God who is never weary. Now, Mrs. Blake, during the Carbon- iferous period, we had only shell-fish, fishes, radiata; then came reptiles; then birds, and theirs was called, you know, the Triassic period. According to Moses, these animals, which should have appeared at intervals separated by millions of years, all came in one day." "HEow do you know this?" asked Miss Phebe; "what authority have you for saying such awful things?" "As good, and better, than Moses had for saying what he has said." ' O Henrique! I certainly shall not stay to hear such talk! Mrs. Blake, I am surprised at you! indeed I am. Father would not like it if he could know what our con- versation is." "Please forbear a little, Phebe," replied Henrique; 4' It will do you good; some day you will recall this evening. We are told, Mrs. Blake, that God created beasts, and cattle, and creeping things, and men upon   -/ :          INTUITION.          25 the same day. I suppose creeping things implies rep- tiles." ' I suppose so." "Well, reptiles are found in the Carboniferous formLa- tions; and geologists of great eminence teach that cattle did not come until the third period, and man near its close."'           , "I have not read of any rain," timidly suggested Hope. Miss Phebe gave her a glance which caused crimson blushes. "It does not speak of it, dear," answered Mr. Mac- kenzie, "until all things were created; yet impressions of rain-drops have been found in the rocks as low as the fishes. Now, Mrs. Blake, what are we to think? We hear from Moses nothing of the condition of things fol- lowing chaos, nothing of reasonable conditions and formations, nothing of that progress which lncontro- vertibly has ever been and ever will be, nothing of the abrasions caused by water and time, nothing of the constant change of land and sea.  Moses was igno- "rant."  Phebe rose, and declared her intention of leaving. Henrique playfully placed her in her chair, sitting be- side her as a guard. "I shall inform father." Hope gave her sister a pleading glance. "What is it David says, Mrs. Blake, about thile bounds of the sea? does he not say, ' God has set the bounds of the sea that the waves may not pass over?' and Jer- emiah declares that he sand, by a perpetual decree, 2t 26         INTUITION. makes the limits of the sea, and that the waters cannot pass over." 1' What of it?" asked Hope in her innocence. Sihe never had, in all her twenty years, been allowed to read a word that might bear a shadow of contradiction to the Old Testament writers. Shlle had been forbiddel all geological lectures, was never allowed to speak the dictations of intuition, or whisper any religious senti- ment coming of reason. Born and bred beneath the rule of father, mother, and quite elderly sister Phebe, -the primary catechism down .to the weekly Bible-class had been the extent, length, width, and depth, of her soul's manna. She remembered from a little girl, how she always had dreaded the Sundays; how stale the sanctimonious faces and best clothes had become; hlow much she could repeat of the minister's sermons con- cerning that heaven she was going to if she was very, very good indeed, or that hell, if she was not very, very good indeed. She remembered telling her mother once, for which she received a terrible whipping, that L' she almost dreaded to go to heaven, since there was going to be nothing only singing and praising all the time ;" and I do not believe, away down in the depths of her sunny heart, she has quite got over it yet. Mr. Mackenzie was not satisfied, and commenced again, to the great annoyance of Phebe. "Now, Mrs. Blake, we know positively what changes are constantly taking place upon the land and water. Places where seas once bore up their ships are now   INTUITION.          27 foundations for cities, and vice versa. And this is not the half. I question the authority of the Bible." Miss Pliebe whispered, " O dear! truly it is dread- ful."' -Hope nestled about uneasily, and gave Mr. Mac- kenzie an imploring glance. He returned it with an expression of eye as much as to -say, "I want help, Hope! I am troubled." "s Why do you question the authority of the Bible sir?"I felt a trifle severe, and dare say I looked so. "You think the FHebrew the oldest language, Mrs. Blake?" '"No; I believe the Sanscrit is the oldest; what of that? You have been reading Miiller, Mr. Mackenzie." "Well, we have as good authority for Miiller as for Moses.  I find by studying Higgins, that in Phoeni- cian manuscripts there are found writings very like Genesis. Great writers agree that Salnchoniathan ante- dated Moses, and that the account of the deluge and other stories were taken from very old manuscripts by Moses." "Well, lllow it, my dear sir, does it make the Bible less true? I should say it makes it more infallible. I have heard others, Mr. Mackenzie, who desired to dis- pute the Bible, bring forward the same points." "And we have never received the Bible as originally written. (Ecumenical councils held long conventions to see which gospels should be ostracised and which re- tained-some twenty-five to forty, I believe, were dis- puted, and were decided by majorities, which is never a fair way, you know."   23         INTUITION. "Well, what of that? we have sufficient without them." "But if I am going to live according to the Bible, I want a correct one. I don't wish to be taught that the Egyptians were the first people when we know to the contrary. But what of that first chapter of Genesis?" Miss Hope laid her hand upon his shoulder with an imploring "Don't, Henriquel!" and Miss Phebe said, heaving a great sigh, " 'Tis dreadful to be an Infidel." Henrique laughed again heartily. I answered his in- terrogation. "Supposing you or I were to write a book this coming year, on some particular science just as it stands to-day, and issue the work. In a hundred years some person writes another, and treats the same science in its ad- vanced stages. Should you pronounce the first book a -ii the ?" "Well, allow this, then, what about inconsistencies? What do you think about Adam and Eve? In six days God. made this wonderful world"-"Of course he did," said Miss Phebe " and from the dust of the ground made a man, placing him in a beautiful garden ; causing a deep sleep-was chloroform known then, Mrs. Blake?" "O Hen., don't!" sighed Hope-" and from the man's rib he made poor, wronged woman: what do you sup- pose Adam would have thought of a Woman's Rights Convention? Eve was tempted, ate of the fruit, gave to her spouse, he ate, and they fell, throwing upon the whole human race misery and death-everlasting pun- ishment. Now, Mrs. Blake, I am no Infidel, (he   - t. ,i - -- X\'         INTUITION.          29 glanced at Miss Phebe with a comical expression,) and poor Mr. Wilberforce, if he would only study, he'd call me sensible; and instead of denying me the privilege of his parlor once or twice a week, would welcome me- be proud--ahem!" "Conceit is a wonderful attribute," said Hope, softly. "Please, Henrique," plead Phebe, " let's talk of Mr. Treat's last sermon. It was so beautiful. It was upon-- what lamentable inroads science is making on religion, Mrs. Blake-and he spoke ably, I assure you." "Yes, Mrs. Blake," said Mr. Mackenzie; " he stands with a five-foot shooter in his hand, to slay every word a person dares to 'say concerning Genesis, contrary to Moses." "It is folly," I answered; " the great trouble is, the sins of omission. The elements are right-Moses did not go into the scientific part-I presume he did not understand the method; but the ideas are right; for If instance, you have just said, ' man is made of dust;' he is. We are composed of substances called prima- ries, first found in the rocks. By constant abrasion these rocks became earth; from this earth, mayhap, came substances potentialized to sustain animal life. A Man is the ultimate of ascending orders-an upward progression  of many  existences below him. God's hand held all the particles until He created the perfect structure. Moses spoke truth, then, when  he said, 'Adam was made of the dust of the earth.' Science and religion need never have an outhreak. Those writers gave us what they knew; if they were not   30         INTUITION. able to explain, because theirs was the age too early for advancemient in these matters, shall we pronounce their teachings false? 1No, Mr. Mackenzie, science and re- ligion may be reconciled if people will only strive' to do so. Every word in Genesis may be made plain, I believe. Why are we not as willing to make allowance for Moses' sins of omission and colnmission as we are for the writers of the present time?" "Infidels stalk the earth to-day, Mrs. Blake, for-these very things. What of everlasting punishment? do you believe in it?" "No," I answered, firmly, and Miss Phebe almost sprang from her chair.  The gentleman rubbed his hands as though an important point had been gained. "Mr. Mackenzie, evidence of true Christianity, I be- lieve, lies in deeds, not creeds. In a high and compre- ,   hensive sense, we want to look at God and the future, and this is impossible unless we reason. Sir W. Drum- l mond says, ' He that will not reason is a bigot, he that cannot reason is a fool, and he that dares not reason is ,    a slave.' True reason comes of knowledge and discern- ment : if people would see that the pure religion comes of trying to better their own lives and the lives of their I    neighbors, by devotion to charity and love, instead of ;,i   devotion to ceremony, then would God's will soon be ;:   done. What we want to obey is, the voice of the In- fi  finite speaking in our own souls. Let us do this, and we have no fear of everlasting punishment.

"Yes, Mrs. Blake; and this is what keeps me from 1being al"--the gentleman glanced at Miss Plhebe slyly, then at Miss Hope, and putting up his hands, whispered I -througlh them, Infidel." Phebe groaned. *Iii C"Mr. Mackenzie, I have been to South Barntown pau- per-house, and have engaged a beautiful little girl of i:( twelve years, or thereabouts, to come and live with me. She is very smart, I am convinced. Poetic, refined. Poor little one, she is desolate, through a terrible belief ; which possesses her. She has been unfortunate in her :i worldly relations, and bereavement has nalned her or- :- 5 phan. She has been taught that if one dies in sin they mriust suffer forever and ever, through an endless eter- nity, in fire and brimstone; this- material fire, thank ?i heaven, has passed away with the enlightenment of the --v age, but is supplied with something little better-ever- lasting remorse." "That's it, Mrs. Blake; thank God I have found a reasonable church member.  Oh! if Deacon Wilber- :?i force could only be here!" Phebe gazed at me wildly, and directly said- ;:  '"I am astonished, Mrs. Blake! ofcou-se, if you do :: not believe in everlasting remorse you believe in some change; there is no repentance after death, you know. ; 4 One would call you a Progressionist." : H  " "I am, decidedly, Miss Phebe." Mr. Mackenzie rubbed his hands again; the invisible soap wore well ai! i   32         INTUITION.,  , this evening. "Miss Phebe, is not progressi on God  Himself? Life without change is impossible. We live because God lives; He is in all things, and all things  are of Him. Everything, from the grain of sand to the '1 entire world, has its originl in the Infinite. Life, then, is a persistent and imperishable force, perpetually drawn from the Great Source. Progress is an incessant educ-  ing of our inner powers, consequently ceaseless in this life; and why not ceaseless in the next? We are sure  of the changes we meet with here, why not believe that hereafter there will be a chance for this educing, to draw forth good motives, regret that will prompt us to. rise from a sinful state; think of all the advantages we shall have added unto us there because of the help from - ministering spirits; why shall we not progress to good- : ness and truth?"'  "The lady replied, "Oh! I don't know; I trust I  shall always believe my Bible so long as I live. I think this age of progression dreadful."           - Mr. Mackenzie had been thinking; he   exclaimed with enthusiasm, "Mrs. Blake, about that little orphan. i girl, I beg you will relieve her mind. Don't let her; grow up a martyr to bigotry."              .: "Don't ruin her hope of heaven," Miss Phebe sighed. 8 We discussed the topic for a while longer, then in-  : troduced something more genial to the ladies. Mr.   : Mackenzie and I both begging pardon for our breach of  I etiquette.  Hope's pleasant face warmed into radiance, and I thought the gentleman's choice a very good one, :-: but I  doubted whether Mr. Wilberforce ever could be- come reconciled to his daughter's hope.         l :'i i    CHAPTER III. CuTruP came about noon to-day. She walked a dis- tance of four miles. I had been expecting her all the morning, Mrs. Daley surely promised to send her on the early train, but, from the girl's reluctant confession, I found Mrs. Daley was not reprehensible. Cutup shuns human society-human companionship, I am positive. She had not much baggage, to be sure: a large cotton kerchief, fiery red and yellow, contained her ward- robe; it consisted of one dress, purple and white ging- ham, two aprons manufactured from a flour bag, one chemise, one pair of drawers, no hose, no shoes. She wore the same dark calico she had on yesterday, a small cape of black silk pinned over her shoulders, a faded sun-bonnet upon her head, a pair of stout shoes, stock- ings the color of a mud puddle. I saw traces of tears upon her cheeks, and she looked weary enough. I did not wonder the poor child refused to become a passen- ger on the eight o'clock train. I did not allude to her scanty wardrobe, but she said- "I have not much, ma'am; I have been there two years, and never saw my own dresses after I entered the doors. I had good clothes-or better than these-- 2*             (33)   34         INTUITION S for, though mother was sick all the time, she kept me  neat."  The young voice was pathetic, and I saw a warm  flush come on her cheek when she spoke the namei "mother." I could not make the servant of her I had :t at first intended. She was not fit for a menial. I touched her softly on her white forehead, brushing back her curling bronze hair. I next stooped a little, kis- sing her cheek. The impress startled forever from its rest her desolation; a consciousness came over her;  she knew all love was not dead; she quivered from    . head to foot; her heart beat like the heart of a caught - bird; she trembled like a guilty criminal; standing there in the middle of my pleasant sitting-room with a wild, shy grace. That instant there came a sudden ring of  ^ the bell-gazing hurriedly around her, she, fled with the fleetness of a fawn towards the oriel window, which  was open.  In a second she was through, and stood  upon the ground with drooping eyes and burning cheeks. & Oh! how my heart ached for her! So proud, so hum- bled, so loving, so desolate. It was only that common country annoyance, a tin-peddler. I returned and went  : through the window myself.               . "Cutty,1"I said, " you must not. Is it because you  : are ashamed of your dress? tell me, Cutty, why you are so shy?"                      "Because."                      ?:*' i   Her beautiful face had all the weariness of Milton's, NY as if dead in her forever were the radiance and fearlessS lustre of childhood-killed by a merciless hand, slaugh- ".-/% o,3   INTUITION.         85 tered by calamity for which she believed the third and fiourth generation must suffer. Oh! could that rigid  churchwoman have seen her then! her stern, rugged soul would have forgotten, methinks, the teaching of fanatical creed, and remembered that He said, " for of such is the kingdom of heaven." I put my arms out and around her. I thought of my true God-my God of love, wisdom, and truth. I thought of the angels who had healed mine unbelief, of the free, pure air, of the birds in their forest liberty, of human love, which belonged by right to this child, and of the width of the a world. "I will be responsible for her-the defenceless, motherless one. If I have taken her at my mercy, it shall be a blessed one. First, I will commence to make her love me; then I will teach her that there is no de- spair in this world-that, all is hope, sweet, precious hope, through eternity. I have suffered as she has-as she does. The difference in our years shall lend a charm to our intercourse; she shall feel an infallible security beneath my shelter." She seemed so changed to me, and changing with each minute of time. She did not now, though she had been with me scarcely two hours, seem the same as she did at the pauper-house. I remembered her expression of face when I asked her her last name, saying, "Cutup what?" and she replied, "Anything I can get a chance." I saw now that those words were the seat of a half desperation, half reck- lessness; and I shuddered, thinking what she might have been, had she been left much longer an exile from truth and love. Mvy whole soul was engaged. I had   36         INTUITION. not felt so interested in anything since I buried my dar- ling Cecil. Cutty would help me bear the loneliness of his absence, and I would tell her how lovely his life had.  been; I would impress upon her how well I loved him  - and he me--and he would be so glad I had taken this poor, motherless little one.              ! : So the days went by, and each hour my eyes were opened to behold the girl's true character. I found love was life to her; but she had lived so long within ? herself, I knew it would take time to draw her towards -^ me as I fervently desired; and every day I felt smitten by the appealing look in her face, that I did not comn- 7!: mence to comfort her. But I wanted my teachings to come about naturally. The more I studied her, the    i more I beheld evidences of martyrdom to her terrible belief. I thought her meditative, poetic eyes the most -i -: beautiful pair I ever had seen, and I loved to watch her when she was entranced in deep thought. I had sought for a servant-I had found a companion; and in three  :: days' time, found also that housework was not so disa- -Ji greeable to me as it had been all through life. I never : had been into the kitchen to labor, even at the lightest ?- domestic duties. The smell of dishwater I always had. :,;: declared made me really quite nauseated; to wield a broom was not so effectual exercise as playing croquet. ?; But somehow my educational fastidiousness gave way, and heart and hands I assisted Cutty in all the neces- X:/ sary labor of our pleasant home. In fact, I wanted to  :! be with her at all times; so she washed and I wiped the dishes, she swept and I dusted, or vice versa; she  V   INTUITION.         37 stood one side of the bed and I the other; and when we were all .through, we went up stairs and sat down together. 'I insisted upon her sewing a little each day. I found she was quite efficient with her needle, and very neat; natural genius required brief dictation. Then I com- menced at once her system of education.  She had plead so hard and pathetically to be allowed to study at home with me--at least, she said, for the present-that I consented. We got Cecil's old school-books out, and she went to work with determined resolve. She did marvelously well considering her early deprivation. But I was greatly amused each day to behold the theo- logical interrogations she would mix so with everything she attempted: they seemed to intrude so naturally. I had a neighbor who came at once, and in an immeas- urably brief space of time commenced and completed Cutty's wardrobe. Five new dresses, skirts, aprons, three nice changes of linen, and I had been to Boston to buy her a pretty Sunday hat, also a broad-brimmed straw for the yard, a genteel little basque, two pairs of boots, and several pairs of white stockings. She looked charmingly in these new suits: you can- not conceive how well modest attire -befitted her lithe form; land the buff and blue cambrics were so becoming. I was, however, quite astonished when I displayed these matters before her, that she evinced so little enthusiasm. She was very grateful-that was perfectly palpable ; but she lacked that joy, that bounding expression I had expected ; and she wore her new goods with the dignity   38        INTUITION.  of a nonchalant woman of the world. I was disap-  pointed. I longed to see her clap her hands and ex-  claim, even though she turned sycophant to self, -"Oh! ,; how pretty I shall look in them!" I longed for a  brightening of her eye, a curl of pride on her lip, even  a smile of self-satisfaction. But she was a graceful little thing, and proud, though she displayed so little of Lucifer's quality. I had not laughed heartily since Cecil died; now I found something to "smile audibly" over every day. I must make her seem less a woman,  if possible. At last I thought of an expedient. She  required companionship of her own years; she had  been denied the society of other children, save Mrs. Daley's babies, the care of whom must compensate for their company. Across the way lived Mrs. Holt. She  had a daughter two years Cutty's junior, a pretty, frol- icking piece of flesh, plump as a feather pillow, full of wit, and, I must confess, gayer than I had an idea my  adopted would like; yet I accepted her as the alterna- tive, as my other neighbors reared only masculine fra- ternities, and I rather Cutty would not play with the  boys.  I invited Lizzie Holt over to see Cutty, and was again y disappointed. I found the child shrank away from her visitor; but nothing chagrined, Miss Lizzie multiplied  the primitive invitation until I was never surprised to ?: see her face at any and all hours-as often was a guest  at breakfast as at tea. Cutty became a trifle roused  from her coldness towards the dauntless, and I found, when I was not by, made herself quite agreeable.   j - )UK   INTUITION.         39 One afternoon I was coming up through the garden, and suddenly fell upon the children, sitting together in the summer-house. I had just come from Cecil's grave, and my soul was very peaceful. I had held one of my holiest communions there with his presence. I had knotted hyacinth, and roses, and lilies, and trailing ivy into that sanctified sign, remembering of whose suffer- ings it is a type. I had formed white crowns edged with scarlet geranium, and I had laid wild blossoms, also, above his pulseless heart. In a confusion of de- light I scattered daisies, and violets, and buttercups- he loved these self-rearing flowers-and when I had finished, there came up from their many petals and leaves a continuous chain of language. I knew his precious dust would nourish many a blossom from whose chalice the honey bee might sip the life I loved. And when I had said "Good-bye, Cecil, until to-mor- row," there came a bird singing joyously, nestling on the mound. I watched his irrideseent plumage 'mid my buds and leaves, while he bent his petit form in strains of rapturous flight, and there came an angel, robed to its feet, leaning towards me. Peace, peace-- hope, hope. This was the form of the spirit. I did not intend to listen, but I heard Cutup's voice speaking excitedly, "What makes me so sober, Lizzie? I should think everybody would be sober when there's so little chance of getting to heaven." "Go there easy enough," returned the roguish Liz- zie, "I s'pose-I don't think much 'bout it; what's -the use? Who cares for the church members? I know,   40         INTUITION.  sure, some of 'em won't go to heaven; and if they ain't scared, when they know all 'bout it, I ain't."  The child dropped her voice almost to a- whisper, and added, "Deacon Gurney stole wood off my father's  wood-pile, 'cause father saw him by moonlight; his wife puts water in the milk she sells, 'cause I saw that myself, and Miss Green, she's a great Christian; she Itold a' awful lie-she said she paid five dollars for her  new bonnet, and mother asked the milliner herself, and . she said she didn't pay but two and a half. It's a  homely old thing, anyhow-covers up her whole water-  fall; and my cousin says she pulled all the hair out of i her old horse to make her waterfall; and I know lots of wicked things church members do-lots and lots. They expect to go to heaven.; and if they do, wicked's ,-j they be, I shall go, I know."     : Cutty said solemnly, "I should not think they would dare do so; they are of the elect, you know, Lizzie."  "What's the 'lect?" asked Lizzie, rolling round in  ; the grass, her merry blue eyes upturned to the waving -i branches of the trees. "Oh! God chose so many people from the commence-  ment of the world to be saved."      X'; '"Saved at any rate?" asked Lizzie, with expectant :- face. "I suppose so. I hardly understand it; we must all try, I think, because we don't know whether we are  one of them or not."                 X "Then I'll run my chance," indifferently replied the  nonchalant Lizzie, rolling into the tall weeds.    INTUITION.         41 "You know you must do all you have got to do here, Lizzie, because if you happen to die wicked, you never, never, never will be happy any more : you go away into everlasting torment." "What's that? hell fire?" said the child, jumping up from her tumble,and with eight fingers and two thumbs striving to comb her flaxen curls. "I don't believe it," she added; " flesh can't burn forever: we should burn right up." "'Tis the soul," said Cutty. "Then my Sabbath school teacher and the minister tells a lie : they say there can't anything hurt the soul -that you can't destroy it." "But it does burn forever," argued Cutty; "the Bible says so." "Oh!" exclaimed Lizzie, with prolonged emphasis; "I guess it's the skeleton that burns, "cause I saw Dr. Martin's skeleton; he keeps it hanging in his back study-0-o-h!" shuddered the child, " and I see there's teeth in the head now; you know it says there shall be gnashing of teeth, so of course it must be the skeleton -pooh! that won't hurt." Cutty evidently felt quite shocked with Lizzie's logic, for she said piteously, "You couldn't talk so if you had buried all your people." "Don't you think your folks have gone to heaven?" asked Lizzie, looking into Cutty's face with a strange wonder. The child shivered, I knew by the sound of her voice; she only sighed, and almost whispered, "Don't let's   42         INTUITION.      ' talk any longer." Going quickly up the path, I entered my pleasant sitting-roomn, resolving that my poor Cutty must never suffer another day. I would convince her that she would find her mother and father and Johnny -: again when she died, if she only would be good. I could so well appreciate her darkness of soul, though I never had mourned over " the hopeless grave" we hear of. Presently she came in, and, seating herself, took l her sewing. I watched her a moment. I knew what the famine gnawing at her heart meant. Her 1"wilder- ness should blossom like the rose." It was near tea time, so I said joyfully, (Oh! how Cutty was helping my own life!) "Come, dear, we will go down now and get tea."                      ' "Please let me go alone to-night, Mrs. Blake; black Jennie told me to-day while she was making the cake, - that you never did a thing until I came here. I do not want you to work--it is so little I can do it all easy. Your hands are so white and small--they were not  "? made for housework."                 ; I received the compliment with a smile, thinking if dame Nature really distinguished her children by their hands, Cutty must be made for the lady instead of my- self. I glanced at her tiny, brown, dimpling fingers, and thought they were fit for a sculptor's model. We ::-' went down together after I had convinced the child that assisting her was one of my greatest pleasures, and we prepared our tea.                  - - "Not quite thirteen," I soliloquized, " and so well -: educated in housekeeping! I wonder what the 'girls *   INTUITION.          43 of the period' would say to see her making the tea, measuring the complement in'the top of the canister-- just two-thirds full-setting the table, slicing the bread, turning tlic cakes, which I hlad made, on the griddle- her round arms bare, her long, brown gingllam apron covering her buff cambric dress, her beautiful bronze hair held in place by a blue ribbon, with the glow of health on cheek and lip."   :i CHAPTER     IV. , I LOVE the twilight now. When Cecil died, and for : months afterwards, how I dreaded the shutting downll of night. My gloom increased; nmy tears rained hard- / cst then, for I remembered how many twilighlts we hlad : sat together, hand in hand oftenest, on the doorsill or at  the window. Iow manyi anAve Mariawec-he and H - had spoken to the evening dews, 1" those tears of the  sky for the loss of the sun!"  How we had planned our future, or talked geology, astronomy, the latest i news, and that religion which we never questioned -for we were together then; we sought not a link   i to bind the mortal and immortal up firmly: we were both this side then.  This twilight I sat on the low - portico beneath the  climbillng woodbine, waiting for  Cutty to come.  She had gone over to Mrs. Holt's to ' ca rry a letter I brought from the mail with mine. O'er  the harp of thought there came the breeze of evenilg,  wafting memory and hope, joy and sorrow, in their turn. I  missed him, God alone knows how much- - I  forget: he knows-nmy Cecil knows I sigh when I see  the vacant place; but he knows, also, I lookl up, whis- A pering, "Darling, that season when we  shall meet, (44)     :!;   INTUITION.          4.5 never again to be parted, shall repay, Oh! so fully, the pangs of our drear separation." Cutty was gone so long, and the evening was stealing on apace, that I thought best to go for her. The first -the very first time I had heard her laugll heartily ; it did my inmost soul good. Lizzie had a huge red ribbon tied around the cat, looped in bows nearly as large as Miss Tab herself. Little Carlo, the dog, was encour- aged by his mistress in barking, consequently his com- panion had her back up in true Grecian bend style. "I told you, Cutty, I'd show you how them ladies looked onl Washington street when I went to Boston with father the other day." Mrs. Holt came to the door, apologizing for Lizzie's rudeness, also saying she was so glad Cutty had come to be with her, for she sincerely hoped the effect would be iin a subduing sense--and the dear little orphan was so ladylike, so modest and gentle. I told the lady Cutty had had no teacher save her nature. "But what makes her so sad and mature, Mrs. Blake?" "Oh!"I replied, " she has leaped the bounds of girl- hood through trouble.  She buried her mother, father, and brother."' Mrs. Holt sighed, saying, "Well, I never should think she came from a poor-house.   I wish Lizzie be- haved half as well. But she talks the queerest on re- ligion, Mrs. Blake.  I am in hopes she'll frighten Lizzie into being less roguish; but somehow the child never   "        INTUITION. was much alarmed by the thought of future punish.  mlent."  "I should be glad of it," I said. Mrs. Holt observed me vith an expression of astolln- ishment. Taking Cutty's hand, I walked home, and we sat down side by side on the portico. The moon had risen high enough to lay its delighltful beams di- rectly across Cutty's face, and lit her bronze hair almnost to gold. She was a lovely picture. "This moon, dear, beholds-let me see-some poet i says, more mischief in three single hours, tlian the  longest day can ferret out."? "I don't like moonlight nigllts," the child said, slowly. j "Don't like them, Cutty? how can you say so?" 8 She stooped, in her soft, supple grace, to pick up a S fallen leaf of the woodbine. I believed she wanted to  hide her face, for in a moment I saw a tear sparkling u on  her lashes. Something relevant to her past, I  thought, and to divert her sadness I spoke quickly: 8 "Oh! see, dear, how  beautiful the trees lookl-espec-- ' ially those poplars!"  She glanced upward like a flash, b and downward like a flash, also. I knew she was strug- S gling to restrain herself; her lips were slightly parted,  as with pain, but I knew  it was a proud fixity of re- S solve.  Her hands picked nervously at the woodbine S leaf.  I believed her lids were heavy with the mist of unshed tears.  I leant towards her, sweeping with bqth my  hands the weight of her burnished hair back froml her white, full forehead.  I gazed upon her with my love which had grown  from pity, that had sprung up    INTUITION.         47 like a flower of the tropics, gaining its majesty in one brief night. I saw the vivid carnation shooting into hier cheeks, and saw also her resolve was giving way. Slie leaned towards me and burst into a flood of tears, sobbing--- ' Mrs. Blake, I can't help it! I can't-Oh! I can't!" "Cutty, what is it? tell me, dear. I will help you if I can." "It--is--because-per-haps-wliat makes me cry-is because-you are so kind to me. I never meant to love anybody again. I have been hard-hearted so long!" "No, darling, not. hard-llearted "-when I had spoken that sweet name, she threw her arms around me, and quivered in my embrace like a fiightened dove. I caressed her, saying tenderly, "TPoor little lamb."  Her heart seemed breaking with the anlguish of memory and the knowledge that love for her had not perished wholly out of earth. "Mother used to call me that; she was a good moth- er, Mrs. Blake, only she was so discouraged--and- and " -she faltered. I knlew she must have courage, so I held her pretty head on my bosom and said, "Cutty, dear, tell me all, and I will tell you all. I will tell you all about how I suffered when Cecil, my precious boy, died, and for so many long months afterwards.  Tell me all; I know I call mlake you happy."  She loolked at me; her lips trembled with breathless incredulity. "You cannot, Mrs. Blake; 'tis not for me-bult to tliinkl they are miserable, and must be through the great   48         INTUITION.             1 Eternity-that there is no happiness in my being good  or trying to love God. I had rather be wicked and go :; where they are." "Cutty," I said softly," do not think so; wait a little until I explain these things; you have been educated by the wornout religion--" ' And it seems so-cruel," she interrupted me in her earnestness, " that mother was wicked here because she was so plagued, and then when she died she must be punished there for ever and ever. Oh, JMrs. Blake, I cannot, cannot love God! how can I?" The orphan  ; girl shivered in my clasp as though cold north winds pierced her through. , "Cutty, if this life was a total failure to her, she will overcome in the other life, and rise glorified througl  experience."                     '; "But she has no chance. Then again, perhaps she  X was not one of the elect."              SI I hushed the poor little wounded thing in my bosom i as best I could, realizing that I must commence ele- :: mentarily to convince her her misery was futile. I knew :2 with her marvelous reasoning powers I must render  -fJ unto her understanding lucid explanations; not mere  a conjecture, but facts and plausible beliefs. I was thank- a ful for her wonderful intuition, for of course it would i assist greatly. I resolved to attack false doctrine at the : foundation; the axe should be laid at the root of the ! tree. , "Cutty, have you been to Sabbath school much?." X "Yes 'm; most always."   INTUITION.         49 4 Have you your catechism here?" "Yes '1.2 "Well, dear, supposing we go in and look it over a little." "I don't like it", she answered. "Why, Cutty?" "You know, Mrs. Blake, please, I tlhink." I did'know, but gave her no reply. Taking her hand I led her within, and lighting the lamp, drawing down !he shades, whispering, "Kind Father, help me to teach tilis little immortal flower aright," I was ready. She came withl her catechism. I would take no vengeance on the teachings which had mocked me, on the belief that had cursed me, but I would strive in. the fear of God and the sight of holy angels, to teach this orphan girl a truth set to reason and stereotyped to that inspira- tion which cometh of reform. We commenced at the first chapter. I glanced adown the page until I came to the question, "How long did it take God to make the world?" She answered quickly, "Six days." "No, Cutty, I think not." I could but smile at the bewildered way in which she regarded me. Her face seemed to say, "How dare you, Mrs. Blake!" Then I told her the opinion of eminent geologists; explained to her the different formations and their progress; told her of changes which are every day, every hour taking 'place. She listened in rapt attention; and scanning the next page, I asked, '; How long since the world was created?"J 3   50         INTUITION. "About six thousand years," she replied. I said, "Geologists teach us the world has existed for millions of years." She drew a long breath of incredu- lity. Turning the page, I asked, "What is God?" "The creator of the world-a being without com--/ mencement or end. What do you think, Mrs. Blake?"  l "God is the Alpha and Omega of all finite things-  the only life self-originating. He is diffused through all space and every world." "Well, Mrs. Blake, it is said we are of God--in his image; what does it mean?" "Mall is a finite image of the Creator, outgrowth of the God-principle within-the soul. Hidden beneath our external disorders, concealed as a gem within the $ sand, is that spark of the Deity. To evolve, to educe this a divine element should be the aim of all humanity; all :i sects, creeds, societies, philosophies, should be united to subject the best method for subduing the enmity be- tween the God and the self hood." Just then the door bell rang. It was Mr. Mackenzie, called to ascertain if Hope left her gloves. I am half inclined to believe it was a subterfuge to behold my little friend. He is a kind-hearted gentleman; he  ; shook hands cordially with Cautty, and when I told him what our entertainment was at the moment of his call, he rubbed his hands, exclaiming,           i "What a lucky dog I am! my visits here are always :j apropos. Please proceed, Mrs. Blake. Nothing in this  wicked world could give me more pleasure, except,   A ,li   INTUITION. 5 perhaps-"  He hesitated mischievously and I relieved him. "Except the consent of Mr. Wilberforce to receive an Infidel son-in-law." "That's it, Mrs. Blake. I would take the hard name and all if the old gentleman,-but never mind. What is the next question? Please give me the catechism- thank you, dear." Cutty handed the book to him in her own graceful way. Glancing over the two or three first pages, he as asked, "What of the flood, Miss Cutty?" With eminent precision she repeated the description; flushing beautifully, her eyes growing dark with the ex- citement of such propinquity to a stranger. Mr. Mac- kenzie was pleased, and gave me a look expressing his admiration of my little companion. "Did this flood drown the whole world, Miss Cutty?" "Yes, Sir," she replied. "I don't believe it. I think it was a local affair." Cutty glanced at me in wonder, and Mr. Mackenzie continued, "I do not believe there was water enough in, on, or above the earth to drown it." "But it rained," faltered the sweet orphan. "What is rain, dear?" "It comes from   the evaporation of water on the earth, I suppose; rises in vapor." "Do you think, child, it seems natural that so much more vapor rose then, than has since at any time?" "I don't know," murmured Cutty.   52.        INTUITION. I said, "Every country has its own peculiar tradition of the flood." "Yes, yes, true," meditatively replied the gentleman, "but I have been thinking considerable lately about that ark Noah built. How much room do you think the family could have had after all the thousands upon. thousands of birds, reptiles, beasts, etc., were put in? Could they have existed there, Mrs. Blake? To be sure the ark was large, something like five hundred and forty-five feet long, I believe, not one hundred feet broad and about half of that in height. Now fill it with the almost illimitable sevens, and food for them all. Who did the work? Who took care of all these crea- tures?  Did you ever think of it, Mrs. Blake?"  7 Another ring.  Mrs. Holt and Lizzie. Mr. Macken- t zie was happy to meet my neighbor, and I ascertained I in a few minutes that Miss Lizzie was one of his favor- I: ites. She took the cricket at his request and sat at his feet, he holding her plump little hand. He recapitu- lated his conversation of the ark to our new visitors, Lizzie paying the strictest attention. N "Now, Mrs. Holt, who took care of those creatures? I asked Mrs. Blake and Miss Cutty; I hope you will enlighten me, dear madam, if possible." "How many people were there?" queried Lizzie. "Eight;" replied the gentleman.          ,i "Oh, what a time they must have had, with all those I kicking, crawling, climbing, jumping things. I should X thought Miss Noah would have been awful scat."    S ?'i   INTUITION.          53 H"ush, child, hush!" said her mother; and Mr. Mackenzie laughed heartily. "And one window, Mrs. Blake-and that closed after awhile." "Oh, dear me! I think Mr. Noah was a funny man, to shut up his wife and children with them terrible thngs in the dark-and how did they ever sleep nights with all the roaring and b)arking and crowing and chirp- ing and mewing and-and--" "Hush, Lizzie! Mr. Mackenzie," said Mrs. Holt, seriously, L I am sorry to hear a gentleman of your high moral and intellectual character talk so. My husband says you should have been a divine." "I would like to be, my dear madam, and thanks for the compliment, if such it be; but I should be a divine :i  of reason, philosophy, of the true and lovely God. Mrs. Holt, I believe with Mrs. Blake, that Infidels are made every day because you church people will cling to effete tradition rather than use your God-given intuition and reason. Moses was right in the declaration, but he fails to explain; probably he had not the correct knowledge. I believe the Pentateuch was the result of manuscript preceding it. It is conceded by learned savants of the East that much of the manuscript of the Brahmins is anterior to our Bible. You do not believe, Mrs. Holt, that which contravenes your good sense." "I believe what I have been taught, Mr. Mackenzie. The religion that lmy mother and father lived and died I  by will do for me."   "But gran'ma was awful 'fraid to die," said Lizzie, Ic rlrI u      u  I   54        INTUITION. with widening eyes of heaven's blue. "I remember how she said she wished she knew sure whether she should live after she was dead; and once she cried awful hard and said she couldn't help being 'fraid cause every thing was so uncertain. I aint scat's that, and I don't know nothing 'bout religion neither; but some- how I feel jest's though God would tell the angels to take care of Lizzie Holt, and that I should talk and laugh and look and act jest's I do here. Somehow, Mr. Mackenzie, I never worry much. I feel awfully when I know I'm real naughty, though-but I don't think God cares how much we make fun, if it is the  1 right kind. Why, He laughs himself, of course; who  i could think of a God that didn't?"  "Lizzie Holt!" exclaimed her mother, "do hush! Mr. Mackenzie, what shall I do with that child? Isn't? it dreadful-such ideas of death and God?"  "Beautiful! beautiful, madam; you ought to thank  . heaven for it-you may some day."  Lizzie's wide eyes I glanced from  one to the other, and seemed filled with I a great wonder. , "Mrs. Holt," said the gentleman, "I would never proselyte you to any sinful belief, but I would awaken ! you to reason.  I would give you a doctrine of proofs. I I would make the Bible your guide in all things wherein I it appeals unto and is answered affirmatively by reason I and judgment, led by intuition. I would hold up that i blessed man, Jesus, and have you humble and benevo-  X lent and charitable, as he was. I would have you seeik  for the greatest link in life's chain to the other life; the I ,  r:::? ,INTUITION.                 55 claim for things of immortality. I would have you live so that when that door opens through which we all pass sooner or later, you would go, laying securely in the strong arms that bear you." "You mean dying, Mr. Mackenzie, by the door, don't you?" "Yes, dear," he replied; and Lizzie added, "Oh, for a good while I have n't been a bit 'fraid to go through." The child's countenance quickly assumed a sad expres- sion, and she glanced lovingly towards her mother. "Why can't I believe God loves me so He won't never let me get any harm any way? Why can't I feel's though if I am a good girl 'taint much to die?" "Oh, Lizzie!" sighed her mother; but I saw tears in Mr. Mackenzie's eyes, and thought, "Would Mr. Wilberforce call him an Infidel now?"    i CHAPTER    V.  WE had a rainy night. I think I saw the blue sky through the very first openings this morning. I watched  the clouds melting into the azure spaces. Did you ever see how the edges pass off in thin, white bits, so like cotton batting, with the blue shining through more and more vividly, until the last little thread of cloud is gone and all is soft and clear? If you reply negatively, I pray you watch this beautiful picture sometime. While I was gazing upward, comb and brush in hand ready to commence my toilet, Cutty knocked upon the panel. I called, "Come;" and she met me with a kiss. How fresh she looked--and so neat. I have never seen her otherwise since she came here. "Please, I have made a fire, Mrs. Blake, and the tea-  kettle is almost boiling."               I was delighted because she had ventured to come to my room in the early morning. It was an evidence of better confidence between us. I had been thinking for several days of something else for her to call me. I wanted her to seem nearer to me. So I said, while I was coiling my hair, "Cutty, I think you had better call me Aunty; Mrs. Blake sounds so stiff, and you (56)   INTUITION.          57 know we must be near and very dear to one another. Cecil told Jne last night he was very happy to think you had come, and he loves you-thinks you will be a great comfort to me soon." Tlle chiid gave me one of those strange, shy looks of hers, and in an instant seemed bathed in deep thouglht, from which she roused herself, saying, 1"I do not feel that I am good enough to call you Aunty; I am nothing but a poor-house girl." A rich color shot into lier cheeks, and her beautiful eyes wavered. "I think I rather call you Mrs. Blake, ma'am." That sharp ma'am she had hardly spoken since her arrival from the pauper-house, and I hoped never to hear it again; it so reminded me of her as I first met her there. I did not urge her, for I well knew the feelings rankling in her soul. Proud and humbled- dignified and fearful lest she intrude. I knew well of such natures. I thought time would settle all these little matters. She went down to set the table, and presently I followed. :Black Jennie- ran in to firy the cakes, but I told her no,; Cutty and I did enjoy our work so well together we must not be disturbed." The old lady shook her head, smiling when she said, "I'll be in bimeby to do up them dresses of Miss Cutup's." How that did gratify me-"AMiss Cutup." Jennie had done well, and you should have seen the dear little orphan blush.' I shall commmend Jennie for it, and tell her she hlas the right idea. She was more sagacious than many white women would have been. It is so 3*   58        INTUITION. strange that I ever should really enjoy house-work like i this. Practical domestics will laugh at my calling my I light duties by the above namec; neverthcless, it is so. : While we were eating breakfast, Cutty said, very. timidly, "I Mrs. Blake, I did not expect to sit at the same table with you when I came here. Do you really want ime to?"  "Of course, child; why not? Remember you are not my servant, but my little friend, companion, my little niece." "You thought to have me for a servant." "Yes, Cutty; I did not expect to find such a dear treasure-such a smart, intelligent girl. Cutty, you are far, far above girls of your age generally; very far." I She answe-red nothing, and drank very fast of her choco- late, and e deavored to swallow, but deglutition was extremely difficult. She choked, set her cup down, and left the table. kcould not eat without her, so I fol- lowed. a Cutty," I said, placing my hand on her head all covered with bronze waves yet damp with their morning ablution. "O Mrs. Blake," she sobbed forth, "your love is  , killing me-I cannot bear it." I laughed-not a laugh that would wound, but a quiet sort of ripple one gives vent to when they don't know what else to do on such occasions. I soothed, telling her I knew it all-just how she felt-and that I thought Cecil must think we had funny times. She instantly ceased her tears and gave me another one of those   I;;           INTUITION.          59 strange looks. All the definition I can give is-as though she thought when I spoke in this way of Cecil, a sudden freak of lunacy had seized me. But I knew it would be all right bye and bye. I was very glad she asked no questions, for I was not yet ready to explain. My intensest desire was that every thing should come along quietly, naturally, and at the intervals she have time to digest my teachings. Through the day we studied and sewed, and I went down into the parlor about three o'clock in the after- noon to open the piano. I never had sang a note since Cecil died. I had thought I never could sing Parepa's "Five o'clock in the morning" again. That was his song. I used to play and give him the happy words oftenest at twilight. He in his big chair listening to the voice, surpassing, in his loving estimation, all the An  voices in the world. I see him yet; so pale and pleasant, his great blue eyes riveted upon me, his sunny hair wreathing his handsome forehead in long, waving locks, his mouth all smiles, though pain sometimes caused him to call up the brave heroism of his nature. The chair is vacant-the blue eyes and sweet face in the grave-no! but here-lie sits there, methinks. I feel it; I can truly say, I know it-and he smiles when I chant, "And Bessie, the milkmaid, merrily sings." I heard steps. I knew it was Cutty stealing softly down. I glanced up-out at the open casement. Dear lamb! she would not intrude; she could not, with her extreme delicacy of nature. But she was listening; her pretty head turned a little to one side, and a placid smile on   60         INTUITION.             A her lips. I thought her mouth very large when I first saw her, but she has such a charml when she speaks or laughs or when she wears an expression of interest, I have concluded if it had been smaller it would have ruined " the contour of the whole."' When I was sing- ', ing the last verse I saw her lips move, and believed she was joining in the chorus. I asked her, after I had  A closed the piano and had gone to her side, if she could sing. She very timidly answered, "A little, Mrs. Blake ;" and after considerable persuasion, she softly warbled a  song her mother taught her in her infancy. It was    i "The melodies of many lands." A precious little thing. If I had discovered new    beauties in my new friend daily, I thought I had dis- covered the superlative one now. What can I compare   her voice unto? I know not what. A trickling rill, a zephyr breeze, the plaintive warble of a bird. I was delighted, and determined when the autumn arrived to   engage Montzane, our best German instructor on the piano and excelling in vocal music, to give her lessons. , I did not tell her so. Deep in mir bosom lay the hope of causing her hitherto sunless lifelto waken to a mellow and ripe future. I must dispel the shadow of the past ) which lay upon her, and the yet blacker shadow of the future which she so feared-so feared. Night was down with her moon and stars, and I could see Cutty was glad of it. She had been anticipating all day the evening's entertainment. Byron says of night, "In her starry shade Of dim and solitary Loveliness, I learn the language of another World."   INTUITION.,         61 Cutty brought her catechism and we sat down by the table. I turned the pages until I saw the question, "What is hell?" She answered, "The place of punishment assigned the wicked-the place where the sinful dwell in fire and brimstone; where there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth." I gave a decided negative shake of the head, and Cutty's whole intensity of nature beamed forth from her eyes. I knew this was the particular point on which she was held crucified, drinking hyssop and gall. Cotemporary ministers with this catechism, I well knew, rarely preached the terrible creeds of original days, but they failed to explain away this terror of children and stumbling block of sinners. I thanked heaven the day had departed wheq Dr. Edwards and his brethren stood up before congregations to picture the writhings, the hideous contortions of a wife in hell while her hus- band with all his strength was crying in heaven, just over the great gulf, "Glory hallelujah! Praise the Lord!" portraying in- brighest tints a mother in heaven clothed in white, with a crown upon her head and a palm branch in her hand, crying "Amen!" to the glory of God through the damnation of her innocent babies burning in hell. O my blessed Father God! hast Thou not been grieved that Thy children could attribute such monstrosities to Thy Love, Thy Goodness, Thy Justice? Did not Thy pure spirit and Thy angels also weep when the mistaken yet I doubt not conscientious Dr. Ambrose said," When   62        INTUITION. the damned have drunken down whole draughts of brim- stone one day they must do the same another day. The eyes shall be tormented with the sight of devils, the ears with the hideous yellings and outcries of the damned in flames; the nostrils shall be smothered as it were with I brimstone; the tongue, the hand, the foot, and every part shall fry in flames." Thank God, this is effete-- I dead! Yet, eternal punishment is not made plain to the inquiring masses of people. Because of it Infidels stalk the earth, the mourner weeps at the grave called hope- less, with tears of unspeakable anguish, scoffers fling defiance in the teeth of Orthodoxy, and sceptics cry, "Show us, else we care not; explain, else we will live on in indifference."  But Cutty is waiting.     , "Well, dear, I will tell you what I tlhink of hell. I have studied hard to satisfy my unrest of soul-the unrest I once had. I am at peace now, thank kind heaven. We are so blind, so ignorant, Cutty. I thought when I read what Job says about there being no knowl- edge or device or wisdom in the grave, it meant annihi- lation; and he says, also, that we go the same way of the beast, and that the dead know not any thing. If he had been wise enough to have written something of the, soul's leaving the body-but he makes no discrimina- tion, and writes in such despair-'tis enough to chill one to death. But I found all such doctrine contra- dicted by everlasting punishment, and immediately set about finding, if possible, what this everlasting punish- ment meant. Now, Cutty dear, pay attention, and I 1   IN-TUITION.         63 will tell you what Study and Reason have taught me." She placed herself in an absorbing attitude. "In the Old and New Testaments we find four words translated hell. Sheol is Hebrew, Hades is Greek, and are considered synonymous. The other two are Tarta- rus and Gehenna. Homer describes in his Illiad, Tar- tarus, as a place far below Hades.  Gehenna is 'a compound of two Hebrew words-ge hinnom, or the valley of Hinnom-a place said by different authorities to be near Jerusalem. Sheol is found in the Old Testa- ment sixty-four times-translated sometimes grave, others pit, and twice hell. Understand, Cutty?" "Yes'm. What is the English, please?" "Hell is a Saxon word, signifying a place of conceal- ment." "Well, Mrs. Blake, what is the meaning of the hell we must bear for our sins?" "My child, we are told heaven or hell are within us, as we please. Man is endowed with love, will, under- standing, to use as he chooses. Life is a chain of many links-each act is a link, and each link affects our ex- istence hereafter-each thought, purpose, deed, shall influence our situation in the terra ineognita." "Yes, Mrs. Blake; and that is what causes me such terrible misery. Mother and father and Johnnie are'-" I interrupted the orphan's piteous heart-plaint. "Are better than when they went away. The uplifting law of progress is there a fixed principle as well as here. I have not a doubt but their first weeks, months, even years, were dark, and the law of compensation never   "        INTUITION. forgot itself. But, my darling, gradual unfoldment is a glorious work." "Oh! Mrs. Blake, do you really believe they are better? can they grow better there?-it seems so strange when I have always believed that dreadful story of everlasting torment." "Cutty, remember we never remain in one state here, and I cannot think we shall there. Don't you know every thing changes? We progress to better or worse conditions. The great wisdom which moulds the human race has us all in a perpetual condition of change and progress; will He place us in a fixed state there? For what reason must he so disturb natural laws and make the future unreal? No, dear child; it must be that we go into the next world carrying every thing necessary for our individuality. Take away the distinct tendencies which distinguish us, whether they be good or bad, and we should be no longer ourselves. Then when your mother stepped out into the ' land beyond the river,' she was, I believe, the same woman she was here, and her spiritual eyes were opened to behold her condition. We are told in the Bible of the gospels being preached to them  that are dead. It is a divine law-  this uplifting law of progress-though gradual, there is hope, bright as a jewel set in gold, at even the lowest step; and Cutty, I believe it is the work of those angels who were once despairing, to lift humanity througlr that progressive existence which stretches its encourag-I ing paths through Eternity." "I have wondered," said the dear little orphan, tim-   INTUITION.          65 idly, " how God could have one hell, because there are so many degrees of wickedness; of course he would not punish me as much as he would a murderer. But I see now; he or she must suffer according to their deed, in their mind; but I thought it was forever. Oh! Mrs. Blake, if there is hope, if mother and father and Johnny only can grow better, Oh, I shall love God so dearly, for giving us the chance." The orphan's eyes filled with tears, and her red lips quivered in such appealing pa- thos, I could not help asking the angels to make her their especial care. "One more question, please, Mrs. Blake, then I will not ask you to talk more to-night. Please let's put the catechism away. I never liked it; and I will believe they can grow better there. I will never believe again they are burning in fire, or that this dreadful unhappi- ness must last forever. Do you believe God told men what to write in the Bible? They called themselves inspired of God, you know." "Yes, dear; every soul is of the Deity, and all truth is inspired. Whatever of truth we read from those writers let us receive and cherish. You know I have found through great geologists that many of the state- ments in the Bible are not correct; but that does not con- demn the whole. God is in the present as well as the past. Inspiration has never closed and sealed its books. It goes hand in hand with Progression.  Souls in advanced ages cannot drink of waters destined to increase instead of quench the thirst. The "River of life" has no dam to stagnate its waters; it rushes onwards free as God's   "        INTUITION. love, awaiting argosies best adapted to its swift course. So, dear, remember, "Give us this day our daily bread." Perchance their inspiration was for their day if it will not answer for ours. Let us accept the truths science and reform give us-'our inspiration-the bread and not the stone. Have faith, darling; under the ice the stream runs clear; above the clouds the sun shines warm and bright; beneath the snow nestles the violet and anemone; near you and I an angel waits our be- lieving and dawning into peace." "Oh! Mrs. Blake, what makes mer feel every minute better and better? What is it causes me to love God when I have never known whether I could or no? To- night I shall pray. I have not obeyed you before because I did not care whether I went to heaven or"-she did not finish, bhilt threw her arms around my neck, kissing me ardently, then too full of gratitude to thank me for the evening's entertainment, she whispered a sweet "Good night," and I listened to the sound of her foot- steps going up the stairs. Calmly I sat until the clock struck eleven: reflection was so beautiful I was entranced and could not rise. I realized so fully that all our light, love, and truth are undulations from the Eternal goodness. I had been praying; and I understood that harmony, composed of union, sympathy, propinquity to heaven. Jesus breathed on his disciples and said "Receive ye the holy spirit"- timus as far as they would receive, giving them His own gentle tranquillity. Why did I feel this? Because I forgot all earfthly tliings, intensely desiring commun-   INTUITION.          67 ion with angels. I purified my soul by thouglht and petition, for spiritual influx. I fell into a reverie with the interior voice. I remembered, it is not for money, or position, or power, or favor, we have our probation here, but for the preparation of the true life which is to come. The opening of the inner senses is no miracle: it is only the progress of spiritual development. Making God and angels unreal beings, has been the fault of ages; and our vital relations to those gone before have been misunderstood and neglected.  The descent to Atheislm has been easy, because we have rested content with a combination of old truths and errors, leaving reason, philosophy, and analogy in the background. Revelation from the inner realm has never ceased and never will-this intuitive revelation alike of savage and civilized people, telling of a God and immortality. God is love, and all true love is of God-the corner-stone on which the structure of all happiness rests; we receive this love, and its very possession gives us an irrepressi- ble desire to bestow it upon those capable of receiving it. All faith combined never will save us unless we have our hearts filled with this Divine principle. The more we love God, the less we love ourselves-then we rise above the selfish animal instincts to a state of self- forgetting purity; we walk in the sweet radiance of heavenly light, and judge of all things by spiritual in- stinct-see and feel unutterable evidences. The light being revealed, we understand God's goodness, justice,   68         INTUITION. mercy ; death is the doorway of the better apartment, and we have communion with those we love. The clock struck twelve. Possible that I had been sitting an hour with Cecil-with his sunny head upon my breast as of old, and his precious smile lifted to my kiss, his hands enfolded in mine, his very breath upon my cheek? Even so. , I had found the day which kings and prophets had waited for, and died without seeing. -   CHAPTER     VI. CUTTY is so changed. I regret, she is so mature inl wisdom and understanding. I wish she would not ask such wonderful questions for one of her years, and wear that unearthly look which bespeaks an early death. I am superstitious there. She never forgets a word I tell her, and fearful lest she become an angel too quick, leaving me to feel a second loss, I have resolved not to converse with her again for a week. Mrs. Holt has been over to-day, really in trouble about Lizzie. She is, indeed, a queer little one. Her mother says she can have no influence with her con- cerning the things of religion, and never could have; that the more you talk of future punishment, the more careless she becomes. I asked, "What does she do that is naughty? She seems to be a loving child, though, I am well aware, very roguish." "Oh!" replied the mother with a sigh," she mortifies me to death. Our minister took tea with us last even- ing, and what do you suppose she said after his prayer? he always prays with us before he leaves." I said, 4"I could not conceive," though quite con- (69)   '70        INTUITION. vinced it was something original. Lizzie is her own thinker. "Well," commenced Mrs. Holt with another sigh, "he prayed for the orphan and the widow. When he was through, what does Lizzie, but stand straight before him, and say,' Isn't Dicky an orphan, Mr. Blaisdell?' -you know, Mrs. Blake, the boy they have adopted?" I bowed affirmatively. "The minister answered, ' Yes, dear.' 'Then,' said Lizzie, 'why don't you give him enough to eat, and not make him work so hard?' I thought I should die-; I blushed and stammered, and told Lizzie I should whip her severely; but instead of frightening her, she seemed possessed with the evil spirit; and while Mr. Blaisdell was good naturedly turn- ing it off by laugling, she says, 'I don't like prayin' and preachin' people who don't do what they pray for.' " I thought, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings." "The minister laughed heartily, coughed, and I did 'pity him so! How do you suppose I felt, Mrs. Blake? I took hold of the child, shaking her terribly, and then what do you suppose she did? She turned upon me, saying impudently, ' You know it is so, mother-you know Dicky don't have enough to eat-you know you said so, and so did father; and you know Deacon Gurney stole wood; and Miss Green told lies 'bout her bonnet ; and sometimes-sometimes '-the naughty girl was almost afraid to say it, Mrs. Blake, but she, the next minute, had it out to her own mother. 'She told me sometimes I told lies, and was afraid to give Dicky a doughnut when he looked at them so wishfully, 'cause   INTUITION.         71 Mr. Blaisdell might find it out some way, and think I'd been feeding him. I couldn't endure another moment, and went out. I cried myself half to death with shame; but Mr. Blaisdell said, ' Never mind ; I dare say some- body has been talking to the child.' How do you think I feel, Mrs. Blake, and what shall I do with Lizzie? she worries me to death." I could but smile, especially while I knew the child was so much wiser than the parent. I asked Mrs. Holt what bad traits Lizzie had about her. She an- swered--- "None, except she is such a rogue, and does say such strange things. I tried last night, after the minister had gone, to talk to her. Mr. Holt said I should not whllip her for telling the truth--he's half as bad as she is. Well, after she was in bed I sat down beside her, and told her how she had mortified me and made me cry, and that Mr. 1Blaisdell never 'would like her any more. She answered, ' I don't want to make you cry, mother, and I don't care whether the minister likes me or not, so long as he starves poor little orphan Dicky Welch half to death, then comes here prayin' for such like.' I told her God would punish her terribly for say- ing such things. She just rolled over, wrapping the sheet all around her, and said,'I'll risk it.' I told her she never would be an angel, with beautiful white wings, and she said, ' I don't want any wings-they would always be in the way; besides, I haven't had wings here, and don't believe I shall there. Shouldn't know how to use them, anyhow.' I told her I was   72         INTUITION. afraid she must go to that dreadful place where sinners go. ' I aiil't!' she answered, quick as she could speak. ' I don't tell lies, nor steal, nor quarrel, nor starve any- body, nor make b'lieve be a Christian, nor steal dead people's things before they are buried.' ' Who did?' I asked, ' Miss Grant stole all her sister's clothes before she was buried: Jessie told me so, and her grandmother cried awfully, and Jessie says she hates her aunt for it -stealing everything away from her--her mother's only child; and she says Miss Grant is a church-mem- ber, and makes lots of things and gives 'em to the min- ister's people, and Dicky never gets one of 'em. Jessie nor I don't do such thiings, and we believe God loves us, and we love God; and we never are going to be church- members, neither, 'cause they act so.  And I ain't afraid of no fire nor brimstone, neither. Cutty Stone believes her mother and father and brother are misera- ble, and she cries 'bout it and says she just as lief go to hell as not; and I told her lots of times I don't believe God's got a hell of fire-and I don't.' " This was not the half of Mrs. Holt's trouble. I list- ened, thanking God that here and there a soul liveth, too full of the divine love and wisdom to be the recipient of unreal, unphilosophical, unnatural doctrine-whose intuitive distinctions are sufficient guard against un- healthy and unsound teachings. I did not try to recon- cile Mrs. Holt, and secretly rejoiced at dear little Liz- zie's " moral depravity." I have not been able to keep my resolve. Cutty is so impatient, and I have been thinking how cruel of me to   IN'TUITION.         73 hold my own precious belief and realization so long from the dear girl. Shle said to-day- -"Please, Mrs. Blake, let's put away the Catechism altogether, and if you will only answer me the questions I have been thinking, so much of!" I promised to do the best I could, and to explain, in a few days, why I talk of Cecil's being with me; what I mean, and how it is. I really do not think I imagine it, or that it is a futile apprehension; but Cutty looks almost transparent, lately. She appears quite well, only it worries me to observe how her mind soars so far above her years, and what beautiful and truly profound logic she employs; yet it is so mistaken. She went with me to Cecil's grave, to-day. I carried lovely blossoms, and asked her to help me place them on the mound. While I was forming a cross of roses and hyacinths and heliotropes and verbenas and feather- fews, I said, "I think my darling will be pleased with his grave to-day. He loved these very flowers best; but I must get a few wild flowers, else he will not like the cross altogether ; he never thought a boquet was perfect unless it contained a daisy of the fields, or a piece of golden-rod, or a brook lily." For the first time she ventured to speak when I was thus talking. The strange look accompanied the ques- tion. "Mrs. Blake, do you really think Cecil sees his grave, - and you here placing the flowers?" "Yes, dear, I do. I feel his presence." --; "Do you mean that he is here?" 4 t ,.      I   74         INTUITION. "Yes, dear." She looked upward, and I said, "Not there, but here--so near I can touch him." "O Mrs. Blake! tell me, Oh! tell me what he is like! Oh! I cannot believe it." Her last words rang out like the plaintive wail of those Brazilian birds whose peculiar notes are so pa- thetic that the natives name them 'ithe cry of a lost soul." Lost soul! Is there a lost soul? Not while God is love. Thinking I might be able to receive more of that Divine influx, that emanation from the Deity to angels, and angels to mortal, by Cecil's precious grave than elsewhere, I sought to soothe my orphan charge. She listened enrapt, enhaloed by the golden radiance of her girlhood: each word I uttered seemed to dispel and startle from its long rest of educational prejudice, those cruel holds of thought significant of naught save destruction and ruin. She wistfully mused upon my story and meaning. She placed her hands to her fore- head, pressing it hard, and her mouth gave signs of contraction. "I cannot understand this spiritual body. What is it? Do tell me, Mrs. Blake." "The external body, dear, is not the real man or woman or child; it is only the recipient of the indwell- ing spirit. Between the soul or mind and the outward body there exists an intermediate principle. It is some- thing between the pure spirit and matter-a something conveying the soul to the body. Paul says, ' There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.' Cutty, use   INTUITION.          75 your own rationality and your own intuition; under- stand, dear?"              - ' Yes, please, Mrs. Blake." "Our natural body is wholly destitute of feeling after death. Why? Because the spiritual body containing the soul has flown. The eye sees no longer, because the spiritual part has gone away; the ear hears not for the same reason. Death had no power over the spirit- ual body, nor has the grave. It is immortal, Cutty ; it is not the soul that feels when we prick us with a pin; it is not the soul that receives that peculiar sensation from a fall or jar. What is it then? It is that inter- mediate something which we must call the spiritual body, I think. The external body answers to the in- ternal." "But it is soul, Mrs. Blake."  "No, dear ; the soul only feels the emotions of mind, love, hate, fear, hope. There is something that feels pain-pricks, punctures, and burns." "'Tis the nerves." "Very well, dear; I believe with Kerner, this very nerve-projected form  is the spiritual body; because when any part of the external body is taken away from the whole, there remains a something which answers to the rest. My cousin Ames Gordon lost an arm at the battle of Gettysburg. How many nights he has sat in our little sitting-room, saying now and then, ' O Anne! how my arm aches!' I always laughed, and told him he imagined it; but he declared, ' no, it did ache badly.' Well, Cutty, there is the spiritual body, I believe, which A,;.    . "* ;;.           '    76         INTUITION. cannot be destroyed by carrying away the outward form. The spiritual part of the arm remains, answering to the whole." "Oh!" exclaimed the dear girl, "I think I see it!" and she was perfectly radiant in her advancement. "Take a pin and prick, prick, prick all over the body- the fingers, toes, limbs, head, and it is all alive with pain; now if that could only get away from the outer body, it would be the spiritual. This is all-it is the outside of the nervous system-that is all; and when the external body dies, this feeling of the nerves goes away. It takes the soul with it: they cannot be sepa- rated. Oh! I see!" I was amused and delighted with my darling's quick understanding, and kissing her, answered, "Yes, you are quite right, I think. The mind first affects the nerve or spiritual organism, then the external body; when the external part is dead, the nerve-projected force is deprived of none of its senses, and passes to the higher realm in perfect possession of all that be- longs to it. Yes, Cutty, I think you understand through the loss of cousin Gordon's arm, and you know had his other arm been carried away, and a leg, a foot, there must be the same spiritual part left, an- swering to the call of that which remains. So remove the whole external body, and the spiritual will all have fled, not separately, but as a whole." "Yes, dear Mrs. Blake, I understand perfectly; and Oh! how glad I am! it gives me such a good idea of- form, also."   INTUITION.         " "Yes, my child, the shape of the body is only a re- semblance of the inner man-the spiritual form. The soul is the cause, the body the effect. We call the. Divine Being a man infinite. Our bodies receive their contour from the soul, which is the divinity come of God. My dear, can you think of anything without giv- ing it some form? even though it be a vapor, you bound it some way-give it some shape." Yes." "Well then, as it is impossible to think of anything other than as shape of some kind, be it ever so ethereal, there must be substance; while a formless personality is impossible to thought. When you think of your mother, what do you think of her as?" "A person; I can't think otherwise." "Of course, dear; take away form and you have non- entity. Of that which hath no shape we have not tile slightest conception; and, my child, let the thought of form drop and faith instantly leaves us. We have so much written in the Bible of the inner man. Paul says, 'For I delight in the law of God after the inner man ;' and again, ' Wherefore, henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more."' Cutty readily comprehended me; and I added, "Speaking of form, dear, the will and understanding seem to carry our love into some sort of substance." She asked immediately, "Do you really think they come back to us? does Cecil really come to you?" "I cannot see him, but I feel his propinquity, as truly &@S  t%  1.,yn   78        INTUITION. as though he were here in the flesh and I had turned my back upon him not seeing him, but knowing posi- tively of his presence. When I think of him he seems to come; when I recall him, as he walked and talked, and laughed; and when I think of his caresses and kisses I feel them again. Yes, CuttyI believe, Oh, I know he comes to me; angels have visited the earth from time immemorial. The angel of the Lord found Hagar in -  the wilderness by a fountain of water, and spoke to her, saying, ' Whence camest thou?' Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him. The angel of the Lord appeared to Moses in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush; the bush burned but was not con- sumed ; and he spoke, saying, 'I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob ;' and it says Moses hid his face." "But, Mrs. Blake, you do not think those writers of the Old Testament were reliable." "True, dear, we have proved them ignorant in many things, but I do not reject them because I cannot call them infallible. They wrote as well as they knew how, with the knowledge they had. What reason and dis- covery will confirm we may accept. I believe angels returned to them." "Please tell me what an angel is." "According to the teachings of the Scriptures and our own intuition, they are the souls and spiritual bodies of those who have passed from us. My Cecil is an angel." I saw a shadow flit- across the brow of Cutty, and I well knew its meaning; so I quickly added, "I believe   INTUITION.          79 your mother and father and Johnny will be angels by the time you go to thlen--perhaps they are now, if they have progressed rapidly; all they have to do is to educe or draw forth from their souls the good they allowed to remain latent here. You know, darling, that germ of the Divinity which is within us all-God never will quench his own Life-will realize itself, and come to conscious activity. It may be a slow growth, but the more this germ is unfolded the higher they will rise." "Oh, Mrs. Blake! how I love God! Oh, how I shall try and be good. I have so much to live for now." Her face was pure and ethereal as the dawn, and I thanked heaven she was so rapidly becoming in her un- sullied innocence the creature her Creator had intehded her to be. She would so soon find God in everything, from the lowliest blossom to the mighty tempest, and see him in his love, justice, and goodness. I laid my head back against a great oak tree, near the mound, closing my eyes. Cutty thought I was weary with con- versation, and coming softly to my side, took my hand. I could not realize in this poetic little thing the girl I had adopted for a menial. She had been gifted with refined powers, and only required the aura of cultured life to evolve her beautiful nature. Of the loveliness of her person she knew no more- than the flower does of its splendid hues. She epitomized her intense voli- tion when she spoke of her mother. I could readily perceive she longed to mitigate the censure which lay at the maternal door; for so true a nature as Cutty possessed, held love of mother so firm in her soul she   80        INTUITION. would forget, (forgiven at the first,) because it was the life which gave life. I always listened, and expressed great charity for the dead. I doubted not that educa- tion, the false education of the period, blad made nMrs. Stone the unwise woman she had been. But Cutty never confessed all she endured through memory; her voice was always hushed when she spoke of her mother. It was at once a sublime striving for self-oblivion to the dead sins, and self-devotion to the livingllmemory. Just as I rose to go, Cutty plead in her own pretty way, "Are you too tired to answer just one more ques- tion?  "Not now, dear; perhaps this evening. We will go." I took her little brown hand in mine, drew her broad- brimmed hat farther over her face, and turning my gaze upward, softly said, "Good bye, my darling Cecil, until to-morrow. Go home with mother, please?" Cutty gazed at me in amaze. "Can he?" "I think so--think he often goes with me and often returns with me." She gave me a very peculiar glance, then seemed for awhile lost in meditation. Wye passed through the field, over the hedge, by the browsing cows and sheep, drinking into our souls the singing of the reed, the trickling of the rill, 1' the green chaplets and ambrosial flowers." I talked all the way to my Cutty, of nature; and she made some wonderful speeches. If she lives I am sure she will be a great writer. God grant she may be spared, not to write c" virtue in water and sensation in brass," but that she may send messages   INTUITION.            81 to inward grief, and airy wings to scatter unbelief of Reason that is not Bigot. I remembered what Shaks- peare said: "Tongues in Trees, books in the running Brooks, Sermons in Stones, and good in everything." And Pope's, "See through this Air, this Ocean, and this Earth, All matter quick, and bursting into birth, Above, how high progressive life may go!"   CHAPTER VII. COTTYr and I have had such a hearty laugh. Mrs. Holt sent Lizzie over to stay awhile, as she intended to go out shopping a little. We have three dry-goods stores in the village. Mr. Derby is our Stewart, and from the importations a la Boston, I expect Miss Lizzie will get a reward for her latest roguery. She told it with the most comical countenance and the queerest twinkle in her great round eyes. She said, '- You know Miss Sallie, my Sabbath school teacher?" "Yes," I replied; for Miss Sallie Duane is one of our village characters, known to everybody, and to whom carte blanche is given for her own peculiarities; and to say that is to say a great deal. Her father had been deacon of the "First Congregationalist" for years and years; her mother was indeed a noble christian woman; her brothers were engaged in mercantile busi- ness in the neighborhood- had had some fault found with them by way of weight and measure to be sure, anlld generally disputed the taxes. Miss Sallie remained at the old homestead, taking good care of the farm, and quite forgot the Jews ever had a year of Jubilee. Every head of grain was gathered in; aye, I believe every (82)   INTUITION.          83 kernel, and garnered safely for market. If Ruth did glean after Boaz, that was nothing to her. "Well," continued Lizzie, "I know her, too; and I don't believe she knows much if she does study the Bible all the time. She don't answer my questions half as well as Cutty does. In one of my Sunday school lessons it said that God made clothes for Adam and Eve. I read the verse too; I can repeat it. 'Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord make coats of skins, and clothed them.' She said, ' O it don't really mean God made the clothes;-it is figurative.^ I've learnt that word, I tell you, Mis Blake-'cause everything in the Bible is figurative; and I'd like to know what it's for. And last Sunday our lesson was about Jonah in the whale's belly. I asked her, how he could live there? "She said,' He could, because it was a miracle.' "I asked her, what made the miracle? "She said, God did.' "I asked her, what for? "She said, ' Oh, because He saw fit.' "I told her I didn't believe it, anyhow, if the patri- arch did write it. I guess he was crazy, and I wouldn't wanted to see Jonah when he come out. "Then she shook me, and said she believed I was possessed with the evil spirit. "I said, ' perhaps so;' and she called the Superin- tendent, and he began to talk to me, and I laughed; I couldn't help it. Perhaps I am possessed, same as Mary Magdalene was; but I can't help it when I don't believe 'em. Mr. James is a real clever man, only you   84        I N-T U ITI O N. see, I've found out he and Miss Sallie don't do what they say; and I'll tell you all 'bout it in a minit. Qh, he give me such a talking to--telling me God would burn me up, and if that was n't it, he'd make me suffer for- ever n' ever. I told him I wasn't afraid. God loved me 'cause I didn't tell lies, nor steal, nor plague any- body, and 'cause I gave Dickey doughnuts on the sly- I s'pose he'll go and tell Miss Blaisdell-don't care if he does; I'll find some other way slyer'n that. I know God don't like sly folks only when they do good; then he tells 'em to do it; but they don't-for you know everybody tells some way, how much they put into the contribution box, only when they put in a bright new cent, and make 'em think 'tis a gold piece they've been saving a long time ; and he told me, pretty soon, may be, the angel Gabriel would come blowing the great trumpet and calling us all to judgment. I told him I wasn't afraid. Jesus blessed little children, and said, 'suffer them to come unto me, for of such is the king- dom of heaven.' He said, that meant good children- I expected every minit he'd say it's figurative. Then I asked him if he was all ready to go? He looked awful cross at me, and said, 'Of course; any time-it will be a welcome sound;' and Miss Sallie groaned, and said,'Oh, yes! a joyful sound.' So then he went out and prayed-and prayed for a wicked little girl in the Sunday school--I knew all the time 'twas me. I was glad he did pray for me, if God will answer him; but I rather have Cutty do it, for I know she's real good; and I think Mr. James whips his horse awfully, and he   INTUITION.         85 swore a word of damn to his oxen; I heard him. But I wanted to know if he was all ready togo when Ga- briel comes. Well, last night I saw him going over to Miss Sallie's. It was almost dark, and I don't know what made me think of it, but something did. I just run into the barn and got father's old fish horn, and waited 'til it was a little darker, then I hurried over to Miss Sallie's, squatin down right under the winder. I heard 'em talking 'bout you and Cutty; they said you was a' awful old Universalist, and b'lieved that you could talk to Cecil and he heard you, and that you was an old Sweden woman, (Swedenborg, I very well knew the little one meant,) and that you would soon be a reg'lar Spiriti'it. I was awful mad thlen, for I knew you never drunk a drop, (Cutty laughed aloud,) and that if you was to hear the trump you'd soon git over your foolish ideas-and then I give it to 'em. I blowed with all my m iht, and Mr. James jumped up, and his eyes were big's the moon, his hair flew all 'round, he ran for the door, and Miss Sally screamed, ' O Lord, O Lord!' and she caught hold of Mr. James' coat-tail, and they knocked over two chairs, and stepped on the dog's tail and he barked, and the cat run under the stove, and I was scat and I laughed so I thought I'd die, and I run like fury, and the last I heard was Miss Sallie hollerin, ' Oh, Mr. James, let me go holdin onto you.' I got home, and run up stairs and went to bed; and I asked God to forgive me if I'd done a naughty act; but I somehow felt all the time as though He just as lief I would try 'erm."   86         INTUITION. The recital ended, little Miss Holt looked half com- ical, half as though she feared reproach, and I felt mly- self quite at a loss what to say to her. I was too greatly amused to commence at once any reprehension. Cutty adroitly came to the rescue. "Lizzie," she said, pleasantly, "I believe you are a good girl, and if you should die to-day, think you would be happy; only I wouldn't tease those people, because I am afraid it is wrong." "Well, if they didn't tell such awful wrong stories; didn't Mr. James and Miss Sallie say they were all ready, and it would be a welcome sound, and all that? I jest wanted to try 'em; and they were scat to death." "It was very sudden, dear Lizzie." "Well, they think Gabriel will come sudden." Cutty, in a very womanly way, strove to make Lizzie understand her own ideas of such matters, and I went out, repeating again, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings." The evening came, and I endeavored to persuade Cutty to lie on the sofa and allow me to sing to her, or read, or tell her something interesting of history, but she is so absorbed in our new topic. She laughed pret- tily at the idea of her lying down, and wept bitterly when I told ler henceforth she would be my daughter. I had adopted her into my soul long ago. And she must call me mother, and I should educate her in all beautiful acquisitions, and that Cecil had told me to. She clung to my neck, sobbing hysterically in her joy. I told her on the morrow black Jennie would install   INTUITION.    '      87 herself housekeeper, and our little domestic seasons were all over: we would live in the memory of our en- deavors and the practical education we had enjoyed; though so brief it would be a lasting benefit; and if necessary we could renew ourselves for the kitchen at any future time, with good grace. She commenced to plead her unworthiness, which I hushed with kisses, telling her all I desired was her love and best striving for usefulness.  She nestled near my heart, and her voice was hushed with three words- "God- help me!" Lizzie asked to stay and listen to our evening's con- versation. Cutty told her of the topic under consid- } eration, and she seemed to comprehend very readily. Hardly had I commenced to speak, however, when she interrupted me: "First, Mis Blake, tell me if you think kitties or little dogs don't know anything after they are dead. I b'lieve they do." "Why?"I asked. "Oh! 'cause I do ; I can't tell why." The intuitive reply! I understood it, and answered her as well as I could. I said--- "I do not think, my dear Lizzie, any life is lost-for life of itself is indestructible." I was obliged to ex- plain to the child every term I employed, while Cutty grasped each word with immediate self-solution, and for her improvement I shunned childish terms. "All force is perpetual, for force is life. We, my dear, have given us divine life--it comes of God-but   88         INTUITION. it is the highest; and the animal's life comes also of God, only in a much lower degree. I hardly believe you will ever know your kitty or your Carlo again after their death, because they may lose their individuality. The vital force of Carlo is persistent-indestructible, I think; consequently may animate some other Carlo. Do you understand, dear?" '"'Oh! yes-that kitty and doggy may- go into some other one. Well, if that may be, I shall be so glad: that is better than nothing; for just as likely as not I'll get them again some day-and I'm not sure they don't go to some place where we'll go. Will poor, Sammy, the idiot, go any where, Miss Blake? will he be a fool after he dies?"Lizzie's eyes twinkled merrily, then a spasm of pity shot athwart her pretty face, and I answered, explaining each term as I progressed: "Imbecility is caused by malformation of the phys- ical organization; but rid of this ante-natal curse, they must throw off their chains of darkness, com- mencing an upward and onward series of progress." "Do -you s'pose we shall know folks there?" asked Lizzie; and Cutty leaned forward in great eagerness to absorb my reply. "My dear children, identity belongs to existence itself. We sow grain of various kinds: each sown seed brings that which we recognize as belonging to the sown seed. Our spirits are magnetic: we recognize by sympathy; we attract ourselves to that which is needful for the love; we go forth in special longings; the nat- ural instinct will search through the realms of space   INTUITION.    '      89 to find the love which magnetically attracts it. Know us? Oh! yes, my darlings.  My soul almost bursts with raptures undefinable when I think of Cecil wait- ing to grasp my hand, clasp me to his heart, and kiss my lips as he did here. Together, I trust, we shall twine roses to deck brows pierced with thorns ; together talk of our earth life, of our separate experiences since he left me, of how he used to watch me at his grave, scattering the fresh blossoms, and sometimes smile to behold my perplexity when I could not arrange the vines in the marble vase to suit my fastidious eyes ; and how he used to hear me talk when I looked at his dear pictured face, kissing it each night the old parting peace--when I was impatient for the morning that should reunite us for another of those days which were all fraught with joy and hope. Know us, dear chil- dren- ' But angels whisper soft and clear- The loved, now risen, is standing near.'" Mrs. Holt came in for Lizzzie, fearing, I believe, lest the poor, inquiring child learn something of my views, which, to the mother, seem so shocking. She said if I was willing, she wanted to come in to-morrow and have a good talk with me. I assented, feeling very positive, heterodox little Miss Holt was to be the topic under discussion. When they were gone Cutty said- "Now do please tell me about the dead body: what becomes of it, and how it is resurrected." "I My dear Cutty, ' If a man die shall he live again?' This question has been asked and answered ever since   90         INTUITION. the creation of man. Plutarch, Plato, Sophocles, all wrote upon this subject, and all agreed in immortality. Socrates says, ' I shall not remain-I shall depart. Do not say, then, that Socrates is buried; say that you bury my body.' Our external bodies exchange with earthy things: we give dust to dust; flesh and blood will not inherit the kingdom of God. 'There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.' Death has severed the chaff from the wheat. The face,so many times mirrored in beating hearts of admiration, may blossom in the rose; the form patterned after Venus de Medicis, waves to and fro in the white lily or the thousands of spring flowers; the hands whose caress was once life to the mother, are herbs and grass and kernels of fruit. ' It is thy dust, my darling, gives life to each rose; 'Tis because thou hast perished that the violet blows.' " I read in a newspaper, a short time since, of what was found in the grave of Roger Williams and his wife, after the lapse of one hundred and eighty years: a few fragments of wood, the rust of the nails and hinges, a lock of braided hair; and the fact was indisputable that Roger Williams and his wife had been eaten--aye, verily eaten. The roots of a venerable apple tree had pushed through the life which nourished them.  The larger root had made its way through the soil until it had reached the very spot occupied by the skull of Roger Williams, then it followed the spine to the hips, then divided, sending roots through either leg, even turning up in the form of the feet. The whole, we are   I N TUITION.   .     91 told, bore a most striking resemblance to the human form. If the original body must be found for the gen- eral resurrection, may there not be some confusion? The battle-fields are golden with grain: the soil was drunk with the wine of human blood, and yielded up great harvests to sustain man and beast; when the trumpet sounds will there be justice in legitimate par- ticles, and will they be rightly individualized?" Cutty smiled and said, "But Jesus' body was raised. I remember in my Catechism, where it tells of Jesus standing in the midst of His disciples after He had risen; and He spoke with them." "Yes, dear; but He vanished out of their sighllt. ' And their eyes were opened and they knew Him not.' Vanishing from their view, Cutty, seems as though He was devoid of fleshy body." "But they went to the sepulchre, you know, Mrs. Blake, and He was gone." "They found the stone rolled away; through the in- strumentality of the angels, His body may have been removed." "Was He clothed, Mrs. Blake?" "Yes ; His raiment was white as the light; also that of the angels. "We read always of beautiful, bright, shining robes-of white robes." "Oh! yes," exclaimed Cutty, greatly interested in the progress of our conversation; " do please tell me if you think they wear clothes!" To the mind not given to investigation, Cutty's ques- tion doubtless seems unanswerable, or if answerable, -  --   92         INTUITION. only so through vagary and fantasm. The perfect form must have perfect habiliments, and does lhave, accord- ing to Scripture. I answered the child as it appeared reasonable to. "The material form, my dear, has no shape of its own: it imitates the inner-is a manifestation of the spirit. When the material husk has been cast off, why has not the beautiful cause power to clothe itself in ra- diance unspeakable and full of glory? The lilies are gorgeously clad. Nature robes herself in unspeakable splendor. Has the immortal soul less power than the magnificent field of waving grain, whose grace and form and color attract the gaze of admiration? Is the real man or woman-the soul-' Less privileged than grain, on which he feeds?' " "And those who are gone so wicked?" said Cutty, with a very deep sigh. "Are not so beautiful: their emanations are cloudy. John, when entranced upon the Isle of Patmos, per- ceived that those who had overcome were clothed in white robes. Of the earthly character comes the spirit- ual garb. O darling! why will not people see this? Those who go forth with a record of beautiful acts and thoughts, a life of devotion to goodness, will be pre- pared to receive indeed the golden crown and white robe; while those who go in darkness of spirit because of their earthly discords, cannot received the beauties of the new life ; but, Cutty precious, I believe they are subjects for philanthropic angels."   INTUITION.   ,      93 "But the good seek their good; like seeks like, you say. ' Yes, true, dear; but selfishness is unknown there; their social life may lie with those with whom it lay here, but the antipathy to poor ignorant sufferers is dead. The divine love prevails; even as God loves us in our errors, we love our fellow-spirits, I believe, and work for their good. I have not a doubt but that indi- vidual attractions and repulsions prevail in heaven. I hope so; but they are not what they are here, I think. We here pray that "Thy will may be done on earth as in heaven," and we only pray ; we seek not to make it so; - we seek little to cultivate unity and brotherhood; we exclude from our hearts all that is uncongenial, all that disturbs our fastidious tastes and educations; but there, Cutty, though we go not to the unfortunate for social joy, yet we live in a true heavenly fraternity. There, jealousies, envies are not known ; selfishness bows to truth and love : we may not love all in the same degree -we cannot-we shall love our own best, yet love the society of those in need of help, with the love which comes of the great Father, and which, guided by Him, shall make all ready for bliss in the end. O Cutty! why will not earth's children cease to struggle so for treasure which moth and rust doth corrupt and thieves break through and steal; why not lay up the gold and diamonds of character in heaven, whose interest shall repay through all eternity? why not overcome perver- sions here, that in stepping on the first round of im- mortality's ladder, we may have that impetus which I. . .    "        INTUITION. shall so speedily lift us towards God's throne. We are weighed in the balance and found wanting; we are written in the Book of Life, on the bottom, or middle, or at the top of the page, just as we will by our con- duct here. We need not sigh at last, and turn away with that bleak desert before us, while loved ones are stretching their hands down through shimmering clouds of space, crying, '-Oh! why were ye not ready to come up to us? See how life was wasted--and ye paid no mind to expostulation, to truth, to reform: ye clung to evil ways, and forgot the waiting angel. But buckle on the armor and tread the road slow and sure; walk up the path of progress, though ye must cry in anguish of soul, "Oh! that I had spanned this desert on earth!" sighing for that darling who went before, and who sor- rows now that he cannot clasp you to his arms.' 0 Cutty! why must we do these foolish things here? why cannot we remember constantly, those longing, loving hearts-hoping, waiting, and to whom many reunions mean mockery?" '"O  Mrs. Blake!" whispered my adopted daughter, laying her beautiful face close to mine. "The last time I went to mother's grave I did not remember her as she left me, but as working hard to rise high: ask- ing angels--perhaps Cecil--to help her, to plead with God for her; and I was smiling because I loved God so for these thoughts, when I heard somebody crying ter- ribly right over by where Janie Green is buried-it was the next lot; and a lady all dressed in crape, was lean- ing her head away down to the ground, weeping, Oh!   INTUITION.   *      95' so bitterly! I was afraid at first, but something made me go over to her. I trembled so I could hardly speak; but something helped me, and I said, 'Please, dear lady, who is it you are mourning so for?' "She said,' Oh! don't, child! 'tis a hopeless grave!' then she wrung her hands, and added, 'she was my own precious Mina-so beautiful, but proud because she was so; and she never was baptized, never was a church-member, and did not like to go to Sunday school -did not love Jesus.   Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do? Where has she gone?' "Mrs. Blake, do not think I was bold; I was ashamed to tell you of this before, for I was frightened after- wards myself, to think what I did, but I could not help "Go on, Cutty," I said, with tearful eyes. I put my arm around her, and the dear orphan faltered, fearful lest I disapprove of her act. I gave her an encouraging caress; then she added-- "And I kissed her, and said, ' Mina has gone to God -that blessed God who loved her so, and who loves you and I   so. Jesus Christ never died to curse and condemn souls,.to ruin, but to save them.' I told her all the beautiful things you have told me. I told her how wicked I   was once because I believed the dead couldn't grow any better, and how I thought my mother and father and Johnny are going up, up, every day and every hour, and how I knew I should meet them, for something whispered it to me  every day; and Oh! we talked a long, very long time; and when I came away t- ,.;I -    96  *INTUITION. she hugged me so tight and kissed me, and whispered, Except ye be as one of these little ones ;' and that is what I stole over to the cemetery so softly for yesterday.

She asled e where I thought heaven was ; and if I thought the people there ever grew old. ItoldherI'd askyou, and come in a few days and tell her all about it. Where do you think they are, Mrs. Blake?" I could not answer immediately. I could not turn wispering to her ;" that they were weaving her green cosch arched with flowers, for the rest of her spirit. As tsoon as I could saly, Thy will be done," I answered my adopted dauglhter:             , "Cutty dear, I believe we are very near onr loved ones. The spirit world must be where our inner na- tures are, for they belong to it. It is everywhere. ,he kingdom of heaven is within us. Jesus said it was at hant. The spirit land is real-suhstantial, I believe. 'In my Father's house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you.' Oh! how beautiful John, when entranced, saw angels, lamps of fire, golden harps, thrones, and many other realities.

'4 Oh! perhaps I shall paint that beautiful Madonna I so long to; more beautiful, even, than that one in the parlor." uYes, Cutty, I think so."   She clasped her hands and raised her eyes to heaven. A Madonna herself, fit for Angelo, I thought. "It seems hard for me to disconnect heaven and substantial scenery. All crea- tions have form  we are organized spiritual beings there, I firmly believe, and, therefore, we require surroundings of substance-some sort of location. To conceive of shape without limit is impossible. Wihen we pray, we have an idea of heaven. ' Let Thy kingdom  come, Thy will be done on earth as it is done in hleaven.' ) "Oh!"   exclaimed Cutty, interrupting me suddenly, "how do you think we feel when we die? I do not mean the suffering of the body, but how does the spirit feel-what does it think when it first goes away from the body?" "I believe, my dear, to a true, peaceful soul, the change is a beautiful transition from the darkness of disease to the illumined mansions prepared above. I think it scarcely loses its consciousness; and whllile we look upon the thrloes and spasms with sympathizing tears, the soul, all aflame with joy, is rising to its gain, 5   98         INTUITION. which is our loss, listening to our wails of woe ; pitying our earth anguish, but placidly conscious of its own glo- rious transition. I think sorrow in the presence of the dying should be restrained as far as possible. We stand around the casket, scattering blossoms upon the pulseless heart; we kiss the cold lips convulsively; we drop tears upon the marble brow; we wring our hands in deadly anguish, calling upon the inanimate form for response, and lo! close by, the freed spirit-the angel flown from us, beholds with grief our ignorance, and whispers to other angels, Oh! could they but believe their teachings!' They have had Moses and the proph- ets, and they will not believe one fromnt the dead, though that one speak, as it ever has spoken, in the still small voice. O Cutty! I did not know then, and he must have been grieved-my angel Cecil! Oh! had I felt what I feel now, I never would have shed those bitter, bitter tears. Death is the door of life. Let us realize it-and we shall, as quick as we become assured through study and reason, that the body is only the external husk-that the spiritual, freeing itself from its thral- dom, the inner eyes are opened, and the soul revels in the delights of the new life. Angels hold the door of the upper realm ajar that we may peep in, and we turn away, accepting the stone in place of the bread. O un- believing world! when will ye listen and grow happy? Let us study the soul of all things. Let us grasp the light of reform, and stride up the path of progress. Let us remember, with the mind fixed on things eternal,   INTUITIO N.  we may illnale purity, peace, and drink of the fountain of true preparation." I rose to prepare for Cutty's retiring. She remon- stratel-" unless you are tired, dear Mrs. Blake." "WhVllat!"I exclaimed. "Mothller," she said, droppinlo, her spiritual eyes and blushing deeply. Then she whispered, "I was only a pauper-house child." "A little quee", in all those attributes which elevated' Ianswered I a But I have changed a great deal." "Yes, darling, you hardly would give me that answer you gave mle tlhen, when you said, I Cutup anything I call get a chance to.' That has always been a wonder to me, dear.

I was getting discouraged; and when you called me dear, it was so strange to my ears I truly thought you was mocking my misery. Tlhen I was so proud and so mortified all the time." "Vwell, it is all over now, Cutty; let's forget it." Se made an effort to appear quite oblivious to her past, and in her own pretty way said, "Please, one more question to-night?" "e No, dear; oi the morrow, I think. You must re- tire earlier. I fear Cecil thinks I allow you to sit up too late nights; in fact he told me so." f I -  j i   100        INTUITION. ( Told you so!

Truie, she could not explain. "You have excited me to curiosity. I wish we might v talk a little more." The longing of her heart to be at rest-but discretion bade me hold fast to my decision;  : so I kissed her the " good night," making a promise I would, with God's will, fulfil on the morrow. I sat awhile before retiring, thinking of what I could do for the orphan girl I had taken to my heart and home. Devoid of stint, I would lavish upon her all the ? good I would upon a legitimate daughter. I congratu- . lated myself upon my good fortune in securing a child .: so congenial to my desires; what could I ask more? And she would return for all I might do for her, all I : asked: love, obedience, devotion to truth, solace may- - hap, for my declining years.

I no longer sighingly repeat Shakspeare's- "O gentle Sleep- Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee, That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down, And steep my senses in forgetfulness?"    CHAPTER    VIII. I FOUND Cutty out on the piazza weeping this morning. / Innocently enough, Lizzie asked her how she came in the pauper-house. The crimson cheeks and liquid dark- ness of the eyes told me a story. She hid her head on my bosom, and whispered, "I was so ashamed, Oh, so ashamed! and my mother -" "Cutty," I said, drawing her head up between my hands and gazing steadily in her eyes, "your poor mother, - I have been told upon good authority, was the victim of :j false education. Reared by an unwise, indulgent pa-  rent, who had never fitted her to be the true helpmeet ' 7 of the man she had vowed to love and obey. She had   ; not been taught to be self-reliant, self-sustaining, but -. flew to conventional forms, servants, ease-the luxury she had been accustomed to in her father's house she must duplicate within her own. She did not stop to count the cost; she had never been taught to. Her heart was right, my darling; I have heard she was very loving." "Oh, yes," whispered Cutty, with the warmth of love for mother coming in her face.            ': "And when trouble came she had no refuge; she had '  never been taught womanly heroism, she was easily  ;, discouraged, and--"                 "::; (102)    INTUITION.    .     103 "I forgive her; my poor, dear mother," interrupted Cutty, with her cheeks glowing very red, " and tAcre she is learning, perhaps." "' Yes, dear. Does your head ache?" "A little.' I want to go back into the kitchen. I do, really. I am afraid I shan't learn to be self-relialnt." I smiled at the poor child's fear, and explained the matter of domestic education. "It is not necessary for you to become a drudge, Cutty, to learn how to rely upon self in the emergencies contingent in a greater or less degree to all lives. I would trust you now, to keep house. We nmust attend to the cultivation 'of judgment, discretion, honor, and the many good virtues which make the perfect woman." "Oh, I want to be a true woman!" The sweet wild wind played among her hair, and the fragrance of dew-laden flowers rose to baptise her with consecration of her desire. The sun-light upon every leaf caused her happiness; with a dreamy lustre in her girl's eyes, the fair brow kissed by the bronze hair, the red lips wreathed in reflection, she was a picture indeed. My purest love is in the possession of a new-born angel. My Cecil, flower in the garden of God! thy sweet odor helpeth to perfume the bowers of Paradise, and wafts itself adown the steppes of heaven to centre in my life! Though this precious orphan girl has come to help my lonely days and half fill the void thy absence makes, and I love her with no common intensity, yet she can- not desecrate the consecrated chamber lit by the lamp of mother love.   104        INTUITIO N. In the afternoon, Mrs. Holt came over. She is a pretty woman, and has been well educated. I wonder she so misunderstands Lizzie. After we had conversed  awhile upon the subjects common to neighbors, she sighed deeply, and said,  - "Mrs. Blake, what shall I do with Lizzie? she will ', be herself, and I never shall make anything of her in  ^ this world, so strange--does things no other living  : creature ever would think of. What do you suppose she ., did yesterday?'  I smiled, tlIking I should not be surprised at any  : pretty anoma. I was sure it could be no wickedness. "Well, I wa making some cake," commenced Mrs.    - Holt, with a hea y laugh, " had it all ready to put into the pans-when I thought, I guess I'll bake them in scallops, hearts, and rounds; so I told Susan to get  ; them. She hunted everywhere and could not find a shadow of one. Then I hunted; my cake spoiling, for    it was beat light as a feather, and I never was in such a wonder. Finally Lizzie came in, and I asked her if she :- had seen them.                     -  "Oh, -yes; I put them on Marty Lewis's grave- filled them with flowers-some of my larkspurs and pinks." The whole dozen?"I asked.             - "Yes, mother; some of them I put on old Simon    : - Tuderly's grave."  '  ' My tin hearts and rounds! what do you think of such work, Mrs. Blake?"                ii Cutty was laughing and I had no time to reply, for --X ' ':?i? "3   INTUITION.    '     105 Mrs. Holt went on with, "I asked her what possessed her to do such a thing. She said, "' Oh, 'cause she thought poor little Marty hadn't any- body to do it, and she was a good girl if she was poor, and she knew Marty would look down and be so glad. And old Simon used to make her whistles;' he was one of the town's poor, Mrs. Blake, you know-you remem- ber old Tuderly." "Perfectly well," I replied. "She said she put a few wild roses on his grave, be- cause he used to like them and give her so many; when he went into the woods chopping he always brought Lizzie handfuls of beautiful wild flowers. My cake tins on those pauper's graves!" I saw Cutty blush a little. She thought of those days when she knew no other home save the alms-house; her delicate nature had been touched rudely, but Mrs. Holt was innocent of intention, and in a moment observed her stupidity. She quickly changed the current of Cutty's thoughts by saying, "And now, Mrs. Blake, I want you to hear how the child talks. I said, ' Lizzie, what makes you behave so lately?'  She answered, 'I have not done a  single thing for ever so long that's wicked-'cause since I thought it all over, I b'lieve the angels see me all the time. I b'lieve aunt Lucia and uncle Matthew and little Georgie are angels, and see all I do; and I am ashamed to have all the people in heaven see my naughty ac- tions.' 'More afraid of them than of God?' ' No, of course not,' she said slowly,' but you see God loves us 5*   106        INTUITION.  so much, and pities us so much, and knows just exactly how we feel, what hard times we have trying to do right, and the angels can't tell so well."'  "Faith that would put to shame many Christians,    As Mrs. Holt," I said; but she sighed deeply, adding di-  '  rectly,                          'x "I don't know what to do with her, she asks such strange questions, and when I answer her she don't be-  - lieve, but forms her own explanations. She declares she isn't afraid of punishment, and will have it church members tell lies and do awful things, as she expresses it-but hush, here she comes."              . In bounded the rosy-cheeked, romping girl, full of life, and jubilant in her warm, fresh, golden love which she drank at the fount of intuitive recognition-true christianity. "Her panacea will be effectual in all her future mental pains, Mrs. Holt; her medicine will be for redemptive ends; heri soul will fill other souls; her influx of heaven waft itself to minds filled with dark mysticisms, She will live by principle, law, liberty-- and GOD will be the motto written upon her banner. It is beautiful to become an angel on earth. Tributes, however eccentric, to the graves of the honest lowly,  : will lift her young brow for its garland of white roses : long before she goes where the garland is perpetual." The latter sentence I pronounced sotto voce, while Lizzie was giving Cutty some acorns and mosses she had i; :i brought. Mrs. Holt sighed more heavily than ever, and whispered, "How can you, Mrs. Blake? 'tis all contrary to the '-":';" '-:n4   INTUITION.         107 Bible. But I have not told you the half. I'll see you again in a few days. I do not know where to go for comfort. Mr. James says, ' send her off somewhere where she'll get good discipline.' He was in the other evening, and though he stayed only a few minutes, she must needs say something terribly mortifying." Mrs. Holt indicated to me we might go out upon the veranda; so I rose and she followed. Standing by the ivy vines, she said, "You see, her Sabbath school lesson was about Sam- son. She asked Mr. James if he believed Samson slew a thousand men with the jaw-bone of an ass. He told her, ' Of course.' Then she laughed in his face, saying, 'I s'posed you 'd say 't was figurative.' She skipped out of the room as calmly as you please. I called her back and begged Mr. James to talk to her. He did.  He told her what a naughty girl she was, and that unless she repented she would be lost. She turned upon him the most curious face and said, 'Now, Mr. Jamles, what is repentance?' He answered,' To feel so terribly over your sins as to walk the floor and groan and cry all day, and go without sleep all night, and prav and keep pray- ing, and go without eating.' She laughed again in his face, and said, 'I don't repent that way. I just try all the while to be good's I can; and when I feel like being naughty I shut my eyes quick and whisper, 'Please God, send a  good angel soon's you can to help me be good;' then the angel comes and helps me, and I feel better right off.'" I wanted to clasp the little thing in my arms, and tell   ' ; E . 108        INTUITION.              t her to guide her bark by the voice speaking from within.  She will yet show how well she may bear the olive branch of peace to the great world of sinners; and also . to forgive as we would be forgiven. With fearless hand and foot working in the vineyard; and the effect shall  precede as well as follow the cause to the land of heaven. Cutty and I were alone at last, and the dear child was very impatient for the promised replies to her last earnest interrogations.  "First," she said softly, " tell me if you think we -- grow old there." "It is only when the spiritual youth ceases that we commence to grow old; and if we add knowledge each  hour or day of our earthly probation to that already in : possession, we grow young instead of mature and old, because there cometh in the great future a new birth of 1i; each and every acquisition made here. Through Eter-  - nity, life will be but the re-sowing of the seed, the re- reaping, re-harvesting. You see, Cutty, in this ques- tion of perpetual youth in the other life, we get clear 7;1 instincts of Progression. The true normal condition of all created things is perpetual progress. Understand, i dear?"                         v She did not answer readily with that radiant glance - conveying the decided affirmative; so I added, "You know, child, 'tis only the outer form that grows old; the jA spirit forever retains its youth, and in this way I be- : lieve. Intellectual progress is a perpetual childhood.  Paul speaks of the inward man being renewed day by day, and impresses the necessity of putting-off the old i ':  '    INTUITION.         109 man, or worn-out states, renewing our love and in- tellect." "Yes, dear-" "Mother," I said, with a significant nod of my head. "Dear mother," she continued, "I understand it all; but does renewal mean progression?" "Certainly, Cutty. Colton says, ' The wisest man may be wiser to-day than he was yesterday, and to- morrow than he is to-day ;' and Madame de Stael said, 'That Past which is so presumptuously brought for- ward as a precedent for the Present, was itself founded on an alteration of some Past that went before it. " "Do they love us as well as they did here? and can they help us? I know they can, else--but please tell me what you think, dear mother." How sweet that sounded! I shall be so glad when she becomes accustomed to the name, and forgets her humility because she was a pauper child. "Remember, darling, what I have often told you. Faith will save when knowledge will slay. I believe each of us are accompanied by an angel guard. Jesus said,' See to it that ye undervalue not one of these little ones, for I say unto you, that their angels in the heavens do always behold the face of my father in the heavens.' What does this mean but that angels watch over little children-and also over us all, as far as possible? Hav- ing passed through the discipline of this life, they know how to pity us. Love us, child! I believe they watch with deep intensity our daily acts. If we progress in goodness, they are happy; if we retrograde or remain 'in    "O        INTUITION. inert, they are solicitous. They wait for us with long- ing and anxiety."  "Can they be happy,to behold our sufferings?" "Cutty, I do not believe those who loved us so well here can be perfectly happy there, engaged- in self-elnjoy- ment. Activity is a godlike attribute. Jesus took upon himself our infirmities, bore our iniquities ; will they do less than feel for our sorrows? It will not cause them unhappiness. They have passed through the thorny paths, many of our loved ones, and know how bitter it was; they know also glory must come of experience and practice; the highest improvement through acrid heart-suffering. They know peace cometh at last to the :: valiant and rest to the combatant. Oh, Cutty I if the people of earth only would remember those loved ones in waiting are rejoiced as we conquer, and saddened as we fail, this earth would speedily have answer to that i universal prayer, 'Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.' And they will help us if we only will put ourselves in the proper state to receive. It grieves our angels, I believe, that we will never strive to study how to live nearest them. Let us be humble, trusting, passively negative toward the higher realm of existence; let us be in a state of vital syrdpathly with angels.

"And you do believe they can come near us," inter- : rupted Cutty, hardly realizing her breach of etiquette, a she was so completely absorbed in the subject.  "Yes, very near us, dear.

Why then could not these acts occur without that Latin verb, miror-meaning to be astonished, and from whichl  comes our word miracle, being held up as the explana- tion? But, how natural it is for us to want to commu- nicate our happiness and the good we have to those we love; and how much more they must desire to commu-     } nicate to us their wisdom which has left its chrysalis state and unfolded to a higher life ; how they must long to whisper to our inner ears.

Heaven has endowed her with an exhaustless gentle- ness. The rose is displacing the lily upon her cheek, and I feel very sanguine regarding a brilliant future.   *I1 CHAPTER     IX. * YESTERDAY afternoon, Cutty and I went to visit a   : cousin of mine, Miss Grace Miles. She is a lovely girl of twenty-five years, somewhat faded, people say, but I g think her beauty greatly enhanced by the patient ex- pression acquired beneath suffering's hand. Silent to everyone, Grace always opens her heart to me, and my  g visits to her are a certain sort of duty; for her melan- ! choly, I must confess, is not conducive of much pleas- ; ure to her friends. I pity the dear girl, because I be- ; hold incessant evidence of her struggles, and her nature g is one of those poetical, intense natures, able to com- IV: press great happiness or great misery into small space. I always go-to Grace prepared to receive numberless interrogations, and when she visits me she fairly holds As me intact from all other attentions, by her wistful, weary ! way, so eager to learn if her overwhelming disappoint- X ment will ever be considered and helped, in the world Ad she so yearns for. And now I will write you a little of g the young lady's history: copy it from a few sheets of manuscript she once gave me to weave into a tale. It : is an old story under a new phase, and has received its j multiplication a million times among the children of jj Adam and Eve. (114)    INTUITION.     '    115 She loved and was beloved. Time passed on, weav- ing links in the golden chain, binding the twain so firmly. They had twined their lives so closely, to sepa- rate them was like tearing the roots of an aged oak from their abiding place of centuries. The father and mother of Grace were pleased with their perspective son-in-law; society called the match a brilliant one, and no jealousy or scandal had ever touched their bright young lives. The great wheel of Life turned a few times,-the old mall with the sickle had mown and mown until, for re- spite, he tarried at the door of Mr. Miles' beautiful cot- tage, looking in with eager, lustful eyes, to see what next his greedy hands might find to do. Knowing cir- cumstances and facts so well, he cannot be cheated; so to work mischief, he commenced to sway his harlequin wand, and in three days the father and another of Grace lay in the embrace of a power called Death, which I call Life. When the startling news arrived, Nestor Haynes turned from his counting-room, left New York city, and reached Grace while she yet knelt by the bodies of her father and mother. She did not know when hle entered the apartment, but when she felt a gentle hand upon her shoulder, she turned. "Nestor, OH  Nestor!"  Quickly rising, she was about to throw herself into his arms, when he put her back, whispering-- "Not here! not here!" Startled, astonished, she gazed in perfect stupefac-   t116        INTUITION. tion, following the man who had not even touched her hand, but who receded towards the door, beckoning her with the mystery in which Hamlet's father's ghost draws his son after him in order to give utterance to a horrible tale. So like, was Nestor Haynes' story. When they had come into the outer apartment again, Grace would i have thrown herself into his arms; she felt so desolate, she had so yearned for the broad shelter of that loving bosom, whereon to lay her head and weep out her woe. She met with refusal, which overcame the little strength of her fevered, aching limbs, the pressure of her great agony, and sinking at his feet, she wailt forth such a moan as the man who listened never forgot. "I cannot touch you! I dare not touch you! Grace, God knows I braved it as long as I could, but I could not slay it." 'Tell me, OH Nestor, tell me!"  she whispered hoarsely. "Get it by insinuation, Grace, get it by my slow con- 1 fessions, for I cannot at once tear the black phylactery from my neck and cast it in your teeth. Hear me! H  have been an Infidel all through life." '4 Oh, Nestor, I can forgive that. I can cure your unbelief." "Hush," he groaned forth; " let me talk! 'Tis not that-do not interrupt me." And the stricken girl shrank back, clasping her white hands in straining fear and suspense, while her tear- t stained eyes glared into his, filled with a lust of inquiry. The man, with the width of his chest rising and falling  ?!'.   INTUITION.     '    117 in inflamed beatings, with his eyes full of the shadows of a thousand bitter memories, spoke again. "I have been an Infidel, I tell you, all through life; was an Infidel when I met you upon that first evening; but from that date, the wings of the black spirit un- furled themselves for a flight, and there came a soft, sweet angel to sit within my soul. Men have talked to me of conscience, ministers have held forth Sabbath after Sabbath upon the theme, affecting me no more than the dripping of rain upon. the top of my umbrella. Day after day, Grace, living in your presence, watching your religion, which is no boast, no ceremony, I learned to admire the quiet, peaceful way of your life and won- der at it. Suddenly, going from you,-it was upon a lovely summer night, and the purity of God's stars ac- cused me, the breath of dew-laden flowers seemed the incense rising to awaken thought that so long  had slumbered,-I fell into a profound reverie; walking, I noted not the way, and found myself deep in the intri- cacies of the brook road. Weary, I sat down, and un- nindful of the falling 'tears for the blossoms,' I pon- lered. Conscience, which I had heard meant the God Within, asserted her right; she claimed the crown I had hrown from her head, and the scepter I  had stricken rom her hand. Haviing  gained her throne, she held ne debtor to your purity and heavenly example. I aid, 'I will not go again, save once, to undeceive her.' 'irm in the determination, I rose, walking away to fincd he symptoms of dawn had overtaken me. My uncle ras already astir, and met me as I passed up the path.   "8        INTUITION. . I did not sleep; the day was long, and when evening  ! dawned again I felt an irrepressible desire to b wiith  you. Meeting you, there fell into my soul the old ad- d miration for your mild, beautiful life. I listened o  your words, spoken so fitly, for they were of the loveli-  hess of truth and honesty. I went away condellmned,  i vowing never to see you again. And the great question arose in my mind, Why am I so stricken with a some-   thing, telling me of punishment, of retaliation, if there g be no responsible law? I was a law unto myself, and  became convinced the power within goading me on to right, the force combating the evil of my nature, was God. But, Grace, I thought I loved you, and lest it be not love, I analyzed my heart continually, weigflingc the primary cause with the latter effect. Yes, it existed in the face and eyes of conscience, a true, pure love; but circumstance had chained me, and I must flee you. Then there was a great battle between two demons, a good one and an evil one; neither quite conquering.  Grace, to tell you what I have suffered would be, even  though I employ the most emphatic terms, faint and impotent."                      ; Nestor EHaynes leaned forward, warding off the hands , stretched out to touch him. "Oh Grace! 'it is said the black bread of disappointment is the bread we must eat to give us our greatest moral stature; that the river of sadness is the lyceum, through which to wade that we may reach truth and wisdom.  I did not know my weakness until the golden apple turned itself to ashes, offering me the bitter price paid for knowledge. Grace,  1VI JV 1 Lns   INTUITION.       A  9 where is the Infidel, when one longs to lie in the laugh- ng sunlight of sin's sky, and there rises a phantom, pointing with outstretched finger to the salt sea storm coming to overwhelm unless we turn aside? Where is lhe Infidel, when woman's purity can upset the boat aunched amid the bravados of determination's waters, which say,' do whatsoever seemetlh good in thy sight: it will be all the same in the ultimate.' A wicked woman slays an Infidel; a good woman saves him." With a great yearning after the secret of his strange conduct, Grace waited, but with such tumult of soul as words hardly can express-with clasped hands, leaning towards him, parted lips eager to speak comfort when at last the cause came, with ears vibrating to each syllable ie uttered, and hardening their walls, lest the words he might speak shatter them. The man ceased for a mo- ment, and tears, compared to nothing save great storm- drops, rolled down his pallid face. "Grace!"She moved toward him. "No," he gasped, :'touch me not! They know it now. I believe within this room they wait, witnesses to your grief, and my despair.  Grace!" "O Nestor! keep me no longer in such terrible, ter- rible, suspense! They are here. The flutter of their robes comes to my ear; even now I feel my mother's pitying breath upon my cheek!" "I dare not speak in their presence, Grace." ' Speak! Angels pity-they never condemn." s; Well, a moment, dar-" He hushed his voice, and his lips trembled. He dropped to his knees, raising his   120        INTUITION.            ! eyes upward. "For the first time in life I call upon i God.  Come, Thou. Almighty One and help me! I I have been a better man, angels, than I shall ever be in  my exile." Grace murmured quickly, reaching forth again odnly to be put back-- "Exile, Nestor! you are not of yourself at all! Their death has made you insane. If there really is anything so dreadful, tell it in this minute, passing." ? He answered, "First, I put a question: can love be  pure which is not legitimate?" ( No!" She launched forth the reply emphatically., "'Tis a lie!" he said, fiercely. "Has my love for  you been pure?"            . "O yes, Nestor." "Yes," he told her, " yes, holy as the holy Christ; yet  it has been-has-been-Grace, be prepared: the word I shall speak will darken the whole structure and sym-  metry of the affection you have called yours. It has been illegitimate! The woman, whose right to my love she has forfeited by her conduct, is named wife-wife  to me."  He was silent, and so was the corpse-like girl falling  at his feet. It was a fearful curse, escaping his mouth i  when he lifted her up: believing in the presence of two X angels tingled his guilty fingers to their tips. She had ; not fainted--she was only stunned, and strength re-t  turning through the dreadful consciousness of what the  man had pronounced himself, she rose with a settled  calm finding a rest upon her face, never to be removed g until the touch of time or death shall efface it.  J i?   INTUITION.         12 "Where is she?" These were her first words. "4 In New York city." '4Do you live with her?" "No." "Why not?" "Because I hate her." "For what?" "She makes me wretched by her temper, and has no redeeming qualities. Selfish, vain, weak, a scoffer of religion, a devotee to fashion, and I know not, but rice." "Did you strive to reclaim her? did you employ entle means to win her to your ways and wishes?" "God knows I did." "And yet she would not?" : NO." ': And then you left her?" a Yes." "And why did you come to steal my heart and blast ly life?" "Fate threw me in your way, and I could not restrain e love I felt for you." "But where was honor?" "In my breast-as firm and fixed as when it had its rth." "I do not think so." "' I swear it! Who shall call me to an account for Y  organism? did I form myself? Did I place within Y  soul, uppermost, love for a pure, beautiful woman? ho shall condemn me  because 'tis the ruling passion  ' I,   122        INTUITION. of my nature, no more to be stifled than my breath, save by death. Explain to me, Grace, or I cannot love this God you have caused me to find: make His justice plain, and if you can convince me 'tis just for me to a live forever with a woman I abhor, I will go back to her and accept the life-long penance, praying incessantly for ! help to bear the length of days given me to use as a blessing." "No, Nestor, I ask you not to go to her, but I do ask : you to remember your honor, and crush the love going : forth"-  "Denied of its right, by law of man!" he broke  l forth fiercely, and for a moment there fell silence be- i tween the twain, whose conversation had so suddenly changed from fear and suspense to cold philosophy. When Grace had heard his confession she was par- alyzed to a calmness, only dawning beneath the hand of quick and horrible disclosure. With each instant it was fading. Though she could reason, she could not so well crush out the past-that past binding them so firmly by all ties of memory. And as the waves washed up one after another, bringing on their tide, proofs of that which he had told her, a pity leaped up within her woman's soul, and she was not willing to place herself beside that cold, hardened world Christ so condemned,  when He said to her within the temple, "Go and sin no more."  While she pondered, she felt contempt for ignorance, which dwells in the heart of every man and woman, not willing to compare the finite with the In- finite. ,    INTUITION.     .    123 'u Grace, is God love?" "Yes, Nestor, all love." , Will He save while this everlasting cry for you is in my being? If I pray, will He take away this portion of my life, that I may live on in some comfort?" "He will not take away the attributes He has given you, but He will help you to conquer them. He will give you a triumph in conquering." i' But what did He give me the inclination for?" "To make life blessed with." "' And because I have made a mistake in choice, am I forever to go without love because law says so?" "But law must be obeyed; else, what would earth be? where our safety and peace?" "Give me something reasonable then, Grace-some- tling to live by, and some hope of a future. If ever I am to be satisfied, I can wait." "Whatever His will is, that you must submit to, Nestor." "Grace, for heaven's sake, do not make me an Infi- del again! do not tell me God wills that we shall be miserable!" "Those who conquer wear the white robes, you know." Earnestly, entreatingly, the young man plead for some path wherein he might walk, reconciling God's love. Long they conversed, nor reached a point of agreement. And still refusing to allow even the touch of her hand, ie tarried, asking privilege to tell her how great his nisconception of her religion. "Grace," he said," I have looked up to you as to the je   124        INTUITION. Deity; you are an example worthy of all earth; but when I come to ask the help I need, I find that same cold philosophy all naming themselves Christiani, would give. Now I ask, cast forth teaching, prejudice,-lift the depths up, allowing the reel God to come to thel light, and tell me at some future day, if ever I shall be condemned for the part I have a ted-remembering His charity, Grace; and tell me if ever I shall be satisfied. And now," he knelt in deep humility before her, "' now let me tell you how I shall suffer for you. I shall curse myself that ever I have caused you this woe, coming, too, at this time, when you had so depended upon my comfort. Do not reproach me altogether; know while you can bear, because you have the religion which they say sustains, I must suffer on hopelessly, because I do not, cannot, will not believe what you-do. To remain is torture. Forgive me; let me go forth with a promise that you will consider well my temptation, and with godly charity judge me. Stay \-Grace, I will go alone and look at them."  He went, closing the door, and standing by the two still forms, he made a vow. "I will receive into my soul a tangible belief of God's love and justice, or I will strive to be an Infidel again." They parted. He, going forth with his weight of pity, bending him like unto a reed, and she, crushed be- neath three-fold sorrow, calling upon heaven to sustain her-left with a pang in her heart which promised to be unending. It is said, "Every evil contains some good." Grace realized her last agony had robbed the former somewhat of its sting; yet the desolation had   INTUITION.      .   125 doubled itself-the loneliness was intolerable, for she had so depended upon Nestor for comfort. And when she had laid the forms of her mother and father away to rest, she went home to mlourn more for Iris love she had lost, than theirs, for they loved her still. Days pass- ing, were also proving the soul of Grace. Gazing sternly upon right and honor, and unlflinchingly upon the evidence of Nestor's conduct, naming it base and cruel, she thought to conquer every memory and her disappointment; and not until she grew willing to look steadily in the face of truth which was gnawing at her life, did she commence to pity the piteous pleas he had offered her. The day had dawned at last when a recog- nition of her real longings caused the sad-eyed girl to flee to philosophy; this not satisfying, she blessed intui- tion for offering a merciful hand whereby to lead the feet safely up the hill of mystery, so covered with ob- stacles naming themselves .the inscrutable ways of Prov- idence. A letter came one day bearing the New York post mark. With trembling fingers she tore off the envelope and read--"Grace, have you forgiven me? I have con- demned myself to an unusual severity I think, for will you believe me when I tell you I went to the woman I abhorred, and begged her to come back, that I might better know myself, and striving well for her happiness behold whether I receive repay of any kind; if not, my conscience never would suffer with doubts. You will think it a sin while I held another image in my soul. No, Grace, as penance for love I compelled duty to bow   126        INTUITION. its head, and looked for atonement through the sacrifice. One short month--the world speaks thus, to me it was horribly long-one hideously long month, I held myself in the vice of trial--and failed, thanking God that I had tried. I am  satisfied. I cannot live with this woman, and I cannot wed you--am even denied by law to love you. Now, Grace, answer inme. God gave into my keeping a glowing, redundant, sunlit nature; cir- cumstance, lack of prescience, have made me unfor- tunate. I am denied that which would render me imn- measurably blessed here. Answer me, Grace, can I have it there? It is said there is no marrying or giving in marriage. Perhaps not. But may not two souls drawn  together upon earth, denied all the sweets of unity because that monster obstacle, law, intervenes, may they not find peace in heaven? Answer me, Grace. I know you have that within your soul which never will die.  I know you are angel enough to consider Nestor Haynes' failing in its triue character, and believe you will give me the benefit of any mitigating clause." This is only a part of his letter, but enough to give the great cry, not willing to still itself through the teaching, "Have faith-all things are for the best, and the inscrutable ways have just reason." Grace replied in a few days, and I will give an abridg- ment of the argument. After assuring him of forgive- ness, she wrote, "As the flower is earth refined, so I be- lieve marriage in heaven is beautifully spiritualized. I We   have not the slightest conception of what we may i be. Here, our adaptations are crude and faulty, our i   INTUITION.          127 -elements of character ungoverned; our material form, which seems to us so perfect, I believe, only prophetic of that loving, breathing being which is to be. Love in heaven and love on earth give such disparity of quality, as to make the term unrecognizable in its two bearings. We talk of harmony and testify of bliss; at the best they are imperfect words with us; but when we have met, to dwell beneath perpetual baptisms of the Omnipo- tent love, then can we define the terms correctly, and never until then. We have suffered. I rejoice that it has been so; we are taught the life schooling itself in the stern ethics of the 'must be,' shall find holy free- dom hereafter. A perfect equilibrium is the panacea promised for the sick soul. Nestor, for pure love, springing as I firmly believe yours sprang, in holiness, though the background was bleak and bare, I have faith to believe there cometh satisfaction. I will wait. I will keep my heart, and there you shall possess it; and if you will be patient, living near the throne of nature's God, I will enter into a compact for that Summer home. In ,the height of love's sublimity we may some day revel. I can never express to you my ideas of love in heaven. Watch and wait, believing me when I tell you I never would offer you this relief unless the voice of intuition had taught it." After receiving this letter a year passed away, and Grace never heard from Nestor; then there came a sad, sad message-one he left in careful hands-and with his last breath it was commissioned. The attendant   1P28'       INTUITION. noted down the sentences, that Grace might receive  ' them verbatim; thus they ran:-  "Iky darling Grace. The breath of twilight gives me strength to speak the loving words which fill my  I heart. I have nothing to regret. I have lived as near truth as it is possible for mortal to live. I have been - satisfied to wait, believing you will be mine in heaven. : Just as I am stepping out, I will call you my bride.  The bridegroom will watch at the gate, never wearying; , aud though the years may pass, and many visitants go ; in at the entrance, I will not faint nor despair, for I  cannot be cheated. Two crowns, two robes, angels to I? greet us; a home where there cometh no passion of  earth. A troth only known in heaven.   Watch and  wait."        .                l From that day to this, Grace has worn a patient and . heavenly face. And she does indeed watch and wait. Her faith is glorious, and to witness it really gives one clear glimpses of the better land. Yesterday she ap- peared not quite well, and I asked her if she was ill. ;  "No, dear cousin Anne, but he allures me so of late, he seems to draw me towards him.  I must not get im- patient-I must love life, till the coach called Death comes; yet I cannot deny that the prospect is enchant- f ing." "And you have no fear, Grace, of getting cheated?" "No, oh! no," she replied; "God never cheats His  children-never, Anne." "Do you believe, Grace, he will be yours there? do you believe he will wed you?"  :    INTUITION..    ,    1-29 "Oh!" she replied, with a perfect ecstacy of joy lighting her beautiful face, "I cannot explain. I can only say I am so sure it will all be right, because intui- tion tells me so. I never have a doubt-not a doubt, Anne." And long into the evening I sat with my cousin, an- swering her questions of the hereafter. Not from books came the replies I gave her, not from theology; but from that something, an angel in every life, sitting with outstretched wings to speak peace and precious hope. Blessed intuition 1   CHAPTER     X. MR. MACKENZIE, with Miss Wilberforce, called upon me last evening. Newsmongers had been telling of a decided refusal by the Deacon, and a decided miff of Hope's, also of the lover's despair; but the moment I met them, I knew rumor had only multiplied her many lies. "Going to Europe," the gentleman said. "Soon?"I asked. "The first of the month." "On a bridal tour?" His eyes twinkled, and he answered by an appeal to Hope: "Shall it be?" She blushed-and whispered to me during the even- ing, "Only for papa and his religion." While we were chatting on the topics of the day; the door-bell rang. Jennie responded. I thought I heard a familiar voice, and hastened into the hall. I felt my- self clasped to my brother's arms ere I had recognized him. Upon emerging into the parlor's light, I observed the extreme pallor of his countenance, and that he had become quite emaciated. To be sure, it had been a long time since our last meeting, he having been a resi- (180)   INTUITION.    .     131 dent of San Francisco for seven years. I asked imme- diately of his health. "Sick," he replied; " had a severe lung fever last winter, and have never been well since." A strange, vague feeling possessed me. He was very weary, so I insisted upon his reclining upon the sofa. Mr. Mackenzie had once been a resident of my brother's home, therefore their conversation became mutually agreeable. My visitors proposed to leave, but I urged them to tarry, for the very reason of dread which filled me. I knew death had marked Charles for his own. Mr. Mackenzie approached Cutty in the course of the evening, and said, after smoothing her bright hair a little- "Well, my dear, how do you progress in your matter of the Catechism?" "Please, sir, we don't use it. I am learning beauti- ful things, though ;" and my darling commenced to tell of the peace which had dawned in her life. I observed that my brother listened with the intensest interest, and once raised his head to ask- "How do you know there is a God? I have ques- tioned it recently." Oh! the depth and breadth of that pang which thrilled my soul! I voicelessly cried, "My only brother, my dear, lost brother!" Miss Hope's eyes fairly glared, and Mr. Mackenzie answered, "My dear sir, I am accused by the Orthodox church of being an Infidel; yet I never for an instant   132        INTUITION. doubted the existence of a God and the immortality of the soul." "What proof have you?". Charles asked in a hoarse voice. I remembered he and I had joined the church upon the same Sabbath. I had always regarded him as the most devoted of Christians; certainly his life had been very exemplary; but I needed not to ask what had changed him. I very well knew.  Death's intrusion had changed me-the prospect of it had changed him. Mr. Mackenzie replied, "Proof, sir? Man is the crowning glory of creation. He embodies the refined and sublimated principles of all other orders. The earth offers marvellous combinations, objects which we gaze upon with never ceasing wonder, but they are soul- less. AMan, the height of the creation, thinks-thinks with powers coming of Infinitude." 1"Will not organized matter create thought, sensa- tion? may not the sensation die with the body?" "Charles"--I dropped upon my knees beside him, encircling him with my arms-"Oh! be careful of that dreadful descent to Atheism! Oh! my only, precious brother!" I hid my face in his bosom and wept. "Anne, Anne," he laughingly said, "look up ;" he raised my face to his view. "I am wicked, but-" There wasesilence, and Mr. Mackenzie said- "My friend, our very commencement is a perfect demonstration of a something called soul, which re- mains brilliant while the body may have languished even to death's door. This fact crushes the doctrine of   INTUITION.     .     133 consciousness unaided of a high, absolute force. The same cause which teaches the untutored savage to wor- ship some superior being, some power holding sway of mortal in hand, teaches there is an immortal part for every mortal. What is this power? you will reply, In- tuition. I believe it to be the only direct and authori- tative revelation. Independent of given Apocalypse, we feel the eternity of spirit. Can we prove the nega- tive? Who call say there is no forever-living soul? Who will say we go to the:grave worse than the beasts go to theirs? The existence of our own mind is posi- tive to us, and who shall set limits to our knowledge? Man is impotent to do this : the weak, sick, failing ma- terial body can never do it, certainly that progressive God we adore never will. He will issue no fiats against His greatest law." Charles became so intensely interested that he could lie no longer upon the sofa, -but rose and commenced pacing the parlor. I saw a deep flush upon his cheeks. Miss Hope was getting earnest also; she was nervously picking the beautiful fringe of her shawl to pieces, and her pleasant face betrayed a certain kind of awaken- ment. "What is religion, Mr. Mackenzie?"Charles asked. "Self-denial, giving the benefit to our fellows, combat against evil, good deeds, never to forget the golden rule, to love God with all our soul, to develop the gift of spirit to our utmost, so that we may be well on our way when we enter the gate of the real life."   134        INTUITION. My brother hastened in his walk, and I saw his eyes flash. "Curse this real life! curse it!" "My brother," I said; and, taking his hand, I led him to a seat, prohibiting further conversation upon the topic. Mr. Mackenzie rose, begging pardon for tarrying so long, and soon I was alone with Charles. "Sis," he said, " this has been a strange meeting; but I wanted those people to stay. I knew when they were gone I must be a child. Anne, H"And he stam- mered, his lashes were misty. "Let us talk of some- thing pleasant-of Cecil-you can bear it, I know, for you spoke of him so calmly awhile ago. No, Anne, (forgive my childish vacillating,) but I will not think more of death or the- dead to-night. Tell me of the bright part of your life since we parted. It is so long." "Tell me, dear brother," I answered, " of Agnes. I have only asked of her general health." "O0 no, Anne, I cannot talk of her, my wife, or of my darling Gertrude. Everything is fraught withl a memory and a warning." I understood too well, and checked the theme by speaking of Mr. Mackenzie and Hope. A strange way for us to meet, after so long a time, but the phantom beckoning over his shoulder, prevented our conversing on matters relevant to family affairs. When he bade me " good night," he did say with a quivering lin "AnnP. to-morrow we must have a good   INTUITION.    '     135 long talk, for I came this long journey purposely to bid you " good bye." At last, Cutty had received her kiss, and I heard her dear little feet pattering up the stairs. I sat awhile to reflect, then sought a sleepless couch. The cause was the terrible state of mind my brother had displayed. He held the on-coming enemy in bold defiance. He clung to earth and its attractions because the wonderful Eternity was so unreal-faith in a future state so weak. Morning dawned, and my brother rose early. Oh, what a change disease of the lungs had wrought in him! I saw he wore that same stern determination to do combat to the last with suffering. He coughed and winced beneath pain, but no murmur escaped his lips. He regarded Cutty with much interest, and spoke fre- quently of Cecil's absence. "If there be a heaven, Anne, that boy has gone to it," he said several times to me during the forenoon. ' If one may attain perfection here," I replied, "1 I should name my darling as having reached the state. Oh, Cllarlie, he was so very lovely in all his life." Upon the second day of my brother's visit, he went withl me to Cecil's grave. He seated himself upon the soft grass while I was twining my chaplet for the cross. He held a rose bud, snuffing it for its scent; suddenly he dropped it and rose to his feet. His words fell upon my ears like a shock.    } 4Anne, I cannot, cannot die! 'Tis unnatural, per- haps; but Oh, how I struggle in the fetters which so securely have bound me a prisoner-how I hate death!"   136        INTUITION., His -eyes were large and wild; his pale hands shook violently. "I will not die!"              - I pitied him, but knew not what to reply. I marveled at his strange speech. I longed to help him. He spoke  - - again ere I had replied. "Anne, every thing is so indefinite. I have nlo clear conception of the future. I believe after a time I might be resigned if I could only gain some satisfying ideas of the coming life."                  4 Gently, I took his hand and drew him closer to me- we were sitting upon the rustic seat close by the rest of Cecil's earth-form. "Charles, dqath is an archway crowned with hidden flowers."  Something seemed to  : possess him suddenly, and an impulse of anger swept his whole soul through. He tore away from my grasp.  He rose aid stood before me, denouncing the enemy he  - hated.                          : "Oh, fiend incarnate! Upas of earth! You glutton-  ous epicure! You   devilish, insatiate monster! Eat, gorge your infernal stomach with the daintiest morsels  of humanity I Pick your desserts ard your sweetmeats from out your great larder and eat, eat, until your -vile carcass bursts for its gluttony. Talje me, ye prince of  gourmands!"                       i "My brother, you curse God." " "No. I curse death.  The earth is an arid desert;  the sunlight hideous mockery ; the breeze a sirocco of  I on-coming evil; the flowers the palls of this grim mon-  arch.  Can you stand here, Anne, by his side, nd know  his gold-brown  hair is infested wizh mouldhis lips  ):   INTUITION.     '     137 you loved to kiss, so warm and fresh and red, are now grey with the hue of corruption?" '"Charles,"--I stretched forth my hands-- " his lips are warm and fresh; his forehead as white, his hair as golden-brown as ever.  He is not there; he is risen; it is the external form, only the earthly manifestation of his real self. Cecil is with me as truly as the day you kissed him I good bye."' "Oh, God! that I might believe it!" What a cry! It pierced me to the depths of my soul. Another work before me, and a speedy one; only three days to teach him the way to peace. I must have help- emanation from God and angels. "How can you be so calm, Anne?? you worshiped that boy." I repeated: "'Our God in Heaven, from that holy place, To each of us an angel guide has given; But mothers of dead children have more grace- For they give angels to their God and heaven. How can a mother's heart feel cold or weary, Knowing her dearer self safe, happy, warm? How can she feel her road too dark or dreary, Who knows her treasure sheltered firom the storm " When I had finished, he said, c( That is very beautiful. Oh, I wish I might feel so! Anne, will you help me?" 1' I will, dearest brother. You are mature enough to understand the soul of things; do this and you will have no fear of death."   138        INTUITION. "Yes, sister; but my faith is not strong enough-in  fact where shall I found my faith? The scriptures are fallible; what reliance can I place upon the Bible?    ' King James's Bible was published in 1611; in 1711, it was corrected by Bishops Tennison and Lloyds of its   !. almost innumerable errors. In 176c, Dr. Blayney cor- retefed new errors, reforming the text in some places; ; and since that time ' the British and Foreign Bible So-t ciety, after having circulated inillions of copies of it,  have declared that a faithful examination of it gives rise to serious doubts whether it can be truthfully called the  word of God.' 'In 1847, the American Bible Society    ! appointed a committee of its members to prepare a standard edition of King James's version, free from typographical errors. They prepared such an edition,  correcting, as they stated, twenty-four thousand errors; but alarmed at the attacks made upon it, it was with- drawn;' yet we have a Bible for our guide, pronounced  full of mistakes." 'w "Charles, will you allow this to distress you?"   ! "Well, Anne, facts and ancient history do not agree;  I and I find such inconsistencies."  "Oh, my brother! I am weary of this cry of our day.  AW What has all this to do with fundamental principle? God created man before books were knownl;  Must the   i past settle the doctrine of immortality for us?' Must we abide by the belief of those so far in the lost ages?  Did the ancients hold all truth in their hands? Christ has risen.  Reason and Philosophy come to the rescue;   .i but intuition alone is sufficient. Henry Ward Beecher  k      ,        \ i1   INTUITION,    .     139 said, ' Intuition when at white heat teaches a man in a single moment, more than logic ever teaches him. Logic constructs the walls of thought, throws up ramparts and lays out higllways; but it never discovers. Logic merely builds, fortifies, demarks. The discovering power is intuition.' Have we nothing good in the Bible?" "O yes, Anne." "Very well; accept tie good, and rest that which mystifies you; do not wreck your soul in a dispute with the ancients. Paul says, ' Prove all things and hold fast that which is good.' Alh, my brother, I know well of your doubts. Dismiss them, and admit to your soul the true Christ. 'Tis the effect of this false education. Growing humanity calls for the lamp of faith, which shall well light up the steppes of the soul's immortality. We want a spontaneous energy; we want inspirational food adapted to the callings of the age; we want works and practical benevolence; we want an exchan-ge of sympathy and a practical application of natural laws. There is an intuitive faith-'tis the faith of a little child we need. We reverence the Bible writers, and the present must go back to the past for many things, and what we prove let us hold fast; let us do homage at the shrine of all truth. They have helped us, and for that let us thank them; buat never did knowledge, or wisdom, or research die with them. God speaks to us to-day as distinctly as he spoke to Moses; and his voice comes in the new discoveries, in the strides of progression, in nature, which has told such wondrous tales. 'Tis the soul of things we need preached to us-a vitalizing,   "O        INTUITION. vigorous science of the after life, freed from the blight of theological formality, creed and sect, that shall thrust forth in-either hand a crucible of reason filled with well attested facts thoroughly weighed to ascertain their pro- ducing causes." "Anne, I must have some proof ere I go. Oh death, that master over us, and we so powerless.- Help me, Anne! help me!" The agonized expression of my brother's face I never shall forget. I rose and laid his head upon my shoulder, as it had lain there in our childhood. I caressed his slightly silvered hair. I whispered- "Charlie, could I, I would give you my peace, which has come through such struggles as you must hlave, and I would do battle for your unbelief. My brother, turn back gathering together all the experiences of the past, or as far as possible; then measure them with the evi- dences of to-day. Count the waves of progress betwixt those countless decades and the present. See what im- provement in the teachings on the soul-and my brother, can you not feel within you that something which prom- ises a recompense for each unsatisfied desire here? Each spiritual longing is an index of the satisfaction awaiting us. Can we not prove to ourselves that we were created in every essential manner for fullest en- joyment? In nature everything is destined to reach a state of perfection; are we of less importance? My brother, the Infinite bosom is so large! He will indem- nify all our wrongs. He gave us of His own volition, being; will He not see to it that the gift is a real and   INTUITION.         141 lasting one? And no gift is real that is not satisfactory. 'But, Charles, you are very weary. We must not talk too much." "Oh, satisfy me with something, Anne. Something before I go." "Heaven helping me I will. Do you not feel the Christ principle within you? that which lived before Abraham--that which is eternal?" "I know, Anne, and Paul says, ' work out your own salvation;' he would not have said that had we not the intuition within for the foundation of the work." '"Yes," I answered, " whatever you need use it, and God never will command recompense. There is an en- chantment in Christ's simplicity. It is not subtle theol- ogy, or the products of commentators brains that we need, 'tis a simple faith led by that inner revelation which becomes a moral certainty through its own per- sistence and indestructibility."   CHAPTER     XI. CUTTY had gone away to execute a few errands for me, leaving little Miss Holt for my entertainment. She ran for the cricket, and sat at my feet; she loves to do this, resting her pretty chin upon her dimpling hand, the elbow upon the knee, and while she gazes up into my face, ever and anon trots her tiny foot so comforta- bly. Disposed thus, I often think of the strange con- trast between us. She, the bud, holding within the folded leaves life's mysteries. I, the fading blossom, reading upon every petal the sternly written characters wrought from weary reality and imperishable memory. We talked of many pleasant incidents, and I was re- freshed exceedingly, listening to the child's innocent descriptions of her different school friends, and what she imagined they would be when they arrived at chil- dren's coveted estate. When we are men and women! what an infinite charm this sentence holds for infancy. At last, I observed Lizzie had subsided into a reverie. "Her face so fair, Stirred with her dream as rose leaves with the air." Caressing her flaxen curls, I asked, "And what is my little girl thinking of now?" She caught my hand, (142)   INTUITION.         143 carrying it to her lips, and giving me one of her most witching glances, said- "Mis Blake, I have been wondering most all day who Mis Grundy is; will you tell me, please? I was just thinking of everybody I ever heard of." "' Why, Lizzie, where have you heard of the person in question?" "Oh, I have heard a good many people talk 'bout Mis Grundy, and sometimes I read 'bout her in the papers-that Mis Grundy says so and so. I s'pose she must be of great account, is'nt she?' "Yes, dear. I believe she is a person of some note." "Well, please Mis Blake, who is she?" "Guess, Lizzie." "O, I never can." "Intuition perhaps will tell you." "Well-let me see."  And the blue eyes were raised to the ceiling, while the long, curling lashes winked themselves very fast. Presently, as though she was positive of having proved herself first heiress of Yan- keedom, she said, and that so suddenly I fairly jumped, "It's Harriet Beecher St-." "No, indeed, Lizzie; guess again." Drawing a long breath, she winked faster than ever. "It's-the woman who wants to vote." "No, Lizzie." Trotting her little foot emphatically, she bent her head in thought, then timidly suggested, "The woman who wears her own hair in a little bit of a pug." ( No," I laughingly replied, " try once more."   "4        INTUITION. "O, I've got it now, Mis Blake. The girl of the period." 6' Not hardly, Lizzie. 1 think you will have it right next time." The foot beat a rapid tattoo, and the white forehead was full of wrinkles, while the blue eyes sought the ceiling once more. Suddenly the rosy mouth opened. "Its -the woman who never went to Europe, Mis Blake." "No, dear." ( Does'nt take Harper's Bazar." Smiling, I shook my head negatively, and another guess reached my ears. s"The woman who don't want to get married." "No, Lizzie, the Grundys do like to get married." For a moment the little one seemed quite lost in her reverie, then brightening and clapping her little hands, she said very earnestly, "I'm sure I've got it now." "Well, dear." "Its George Francis Train-I know 'tis a man's name, but father reads 'bout the old woman Train  now is'nt it, Mis Blake?" Covering my face with both lhands, I took time to gain a little rerenity of countenance, and answered,  No, Lizzie, not right yet." "Well, I can't guess," she replied, quite in despair; "if it was Mr. Grundy I could tell easy enough-any- body can tell that." "Who, dear?" "Why, he's the man who hasn't got no personal     INTUITION.        145 friends in Washington, but whlo has got lots and lots of impersonal ones." "Well, Lizzie," 1 said, drawing the flushed cheeks toward me, between my hands, " that will do for Mr. Grundy, but I want you to think awhile longer about his wife." "Cutty's coming-1 guess she can tell. She's got the most intuition, I reckon." My darling entered, breathless from her haste, and the carnation upon her cheek deepened vividly. Lay- ing aside her hat, she sat down upon another cricket, which she had brought. "What is it, please, mother?" Lizzie answered, "O Cutty! I wish you'd guess who Mis Grundy is-Oh! I forgot, Alna Dickenson." "No, no, child," I answered; and, turning again to Cutty, she importuned with her to try awful hard. My adopted blushed as though condemned of iinmense igno- rance, when she falteringly said-- "I never even heard of her, Lizzie; is she very great?" "I 'spect so." "For quite five minutes there fell silence between the two-one of the young ladies twisting the corner of her pocket handkerchief rapidly, the other with her head in her hand, gazing intently at the tattooing gaiter. The ticking of my watch, and the sound of my thread drawn through the cloth I held, were the only lisps to disturb Lizzie's wonderings. Directly, however, she started up, standing opposite me, and exclaimed- 7   "6        INTUITION. s6 No cheating this -time--I've got it, and no fail, Mis Blake! Isn't it something 'bout-"Her merry eyes twinkled like stars, and her breath was all expectancy --"intuition whispers to ime, (the name sounds real queer, Mis Blake,) and I reckon it's something 'bout making pins of people's proboscises." "You have it at last, Lizzie." Cutty laughed heartily, while little Miss Holt drew herself up to her fullest stature, and with a long inspir- ation of relief, said, "Oh! I've got it! but 'tis awful figurative, Mis Blake, awful." The child sat down again, placing her hands a mo- ment to her head, either quite distracted by her severe guessing, or to hold the laurel she had won safely in place. Directly, however, she said, "I think Miss Eu- nice Peek is a Grundy, Mis Blake." "Why, dear?" "Oh! 'cause she does ask so many questions. I al- ways answer her, though I do hate to, awfully. I met her the other day, and she asked me lots of questions 'bout mother, and 'bout my cousin Mollie, and you and Cutty; and she likes James Upham, you know, dread- fully, but he don't like her, I know. She's always ask- ing me what he says 'bout her. He comes to our house lots; and as quick as she knows he's there, she comes right straight over. She asked me yesterday what he said 'bout her when she went home the other night. I told her he said she was always stickin' 'round him." 1' Why Lizzie!" "Well, he did say so.9   INTUITION.         147 At this moment Mrs. Holt came in, prognosticating a little tarry by unrolling her crocheting, and immedi- ately the children ran:l off to their own tete-a-tete. I re- peated my very recent conversation with her daughter, and the lady was. highly amused, saying-  Did she not ask you what the Grundys would do in heaven? I can warrant you that will be her next ques- tion. You hardly can answer that, Mrs. Blake." ' As easily as any question concerning our future, -Mrs. Holt-quite as ductile to reason ; but if ever I ob- served any particular brilliancy in fore-ordination, it is in having so reconciled Miss Peek's character with no- menclature. Grundys, in the hereafter, will be objects of earnliest solicitude for philanthropic angels." "You believe they will progress out of their clinging inclinations?" "Certainly. I do not expect they are to be Grundys through an incomprehensible eternity." "Why do they not do it here?" "One member of the delectable family will never help the other to depart from their especial proclivity. The great evil is, the tribes are so extensive, and among them there is no ' water and oil.' " "Where do you set the boundary, Mrs. Blake?" "The mystic magicienne only knows. I do not. They are a race worthy the researches of an Agassiz; they range from man down to the poor little fly who always is aware of all that transpires around him." "What are their signs?" "A naturalist might tell. I once believed a good in- '    "8        E INTUITION. dication lay in a long nose, a wide mouth, snaky eye, very straight hair. Mythology has its Gorgons, from which I extracted some ideal pictures -the loathsome head of Medusa usually plays some part in my ideas of their heart's portraits; but, my friend, I have found these Grundys among beautiful women, and men ap- pearing very noble. I have seen lovely young girls gathering the olla podrida of society, hoarding it up, to garnish their feast board, for this family have fre- quent thanksgiving days." "Where do you find them oftenest?" "I can hardly discriminate ; no place boasts immu- nity from them." "I imagine they like exciting places best." "Yes; they are in at the birth, holding up their fingers to count the interregnum between the date-of the bridal and the (they so-fear) extraordinarily propin- quious date of the baby's advent. They have a perfect system of bookkeeping, wherewith to refresh memory by those peculiar jottings; a long string of items: the one after the birth, reads, 'I must be studiously careful lest anything escape me concerning the advent of Mrs. --'s child-approbation or condemnation, as I seeth fit.'  "That is true, Mrs. Blake; and they are very fond of weddings." "Yes ; their item following the note of that occur.  rence usually reads,' Careful study to ascertain if they be well matched, if love really was the object, or money, or position, or for a home, or 6' beauty which is ashes,"   INTUITION.         149 or through spite, perchance melancholy, because some- body jilted one of them.' " "And at fiunerals, Mrs. Blake, I believe they have perfect feasts." 'r Yes, indeed. It requires great perspicacity to ascer- tain- the exact particulars through mere observation. The principal objects of interest stowed in their ware- houses are, 'Who felt the worst, who cried hardest, what the last words of the dead were, (those sanctified pearls of comfort,) how much the bombazine was per yard, how deep the hem in the veil, (this is the gauge of sorrow among them,) how much the flowers cost, the quality of the casket, whether the style of robing the corpse be recherche, or horribly anomalous, how many carriages in the cortege, and if the bereaved be a pretty widow upon the sunny side of forty'--the Grundy in- terest is at its zenith." "What item follows this, Mrs. Blake?" "'I must be superlatively studious, even if I am obliged to neglect my own family, to find if the grief really was sincere, and how long before she is courted again.' " Mrs. Holt testified to no elasticity of imagination, but to the shameful truth of my statement, saying, pres- ently, '"I have heard the tribe denominated ' Scenting Commissioners,"' 'Leeches,' ' Sorcerers.' " '"Yes, they are Harlequins; their wands thrust into every sacred home, stabbing aching hearts, and smiting the fallen with blows so brutal they sink never to rise again." -                .p^--rr.*-i..   150        INTUITION. My neighbor sighed. "Do they ever get a damaged article, Mrs. Blake?" "Sometimes, and it enrages them: puts their mettle to the spur, and they wreak their vengeance upon the next victim." "Do they never get punishment for their conduct?" "A continual punishment, only they are so obstinate they will not acknowledge it. I have known them to receive a straight arrow for the sharpened steel they had made ready for somebody's back, a broad palm slap for their blasting conjecture and hypocritical anonymity, a dark-colored eye for a shameless attack upon a de- fenceless woman, whose uncontrollable circumstances they had no right to demand or condemn." "It is truly so, Mrs. Blake. Who escapes? Is there an escape for any of us?" "No, my dear lady; but scandal little affects the class whose respect is worthy our courting. No, there is no escape. The church, the minister-" "Oh, no! Mrs. Blake." I had stepped upon forbidden ground. ( I repeat, aye, Mrs. Holt. Two at the communion eat of His body and drink of His blood, bowing their heads side by side, while the shepherd asks heaven's blessing upon them. On the morrow, one calls the other a cheat, a liar, a thief-and that behind his back. The contribu- tion box holds the almighty dollar for' which man wears the phylactery around his neck, 'A soul for sale:' could each penny speak and tell of the intricate embroglio, the deep diplomacies, the finesse of skill, engaged to secure   INTUITION.         151 it, we should shrink from half the Bibles placed in the hands of the heathen." I had spoken boldly, and the lady gave me palpable evidence of her noll-agreement by a peculiar toss of lier head, characteristic of her displeasure. There was silence for a moment, then she asked, "Is there any weapon with which to battle these Grundys?" O( Contempt!"I replied. "And must they ever flourish-never become exter- minated?" "I will answer you, Mrs. Holt, with Hare's logic: 'When will talkers refrain from Evil speaking? When listeners refrain from Evil listening.'" At this moment the young ladies came into the room and we ceased our conversation, laughing at Lizzie's "Now, Mis Blake, I want you to tell me what the angels do with the Grundys." 'x   CHAPTER    XII. THE evening had been assigned for a visit to a friend; but when tea was over Charles professed great weari- ness and proposed we remain at home, occupying the hours by conversation upon a subject more than unex- plainable to most minds. Cutty, I perceived, was quite impatient, for she had anticipated answers to several questions of her own never-ceasing wonder. I promised at least to gratify her upon one point. Lizzie Holt came in, but declined to meet Charles. Her pretty face wore a shade of sadness, and she said, "I came over, Mis Blake, to tell you my poor little sick dove has just gone to the summer land." Cutty laughed aloud, and I was obliged to summon all the gravity of my nature to resist an ' audible smile.' "You do not believe, Mis Blake, they have another life; but I do, somehow-perhaps tisn't jest that neither; but I know there was all those pretty knowings Lily had that can't die. She would come when I called her and run whenever she saw me, and find the bread- crumbs though I hid them in ever so sure a place, and Cutty knows how much she knew when she was in danger. Now, Mis Blake, where's all that that knew gone to?" (152)   INTUITION.         153 1 ' "Come into the parlor, Lizzie, and ask this gentle- man; perhaps he will tell you what has become of Lily." "No, Cutty. I am going to Sukey Black's with this I have got for her." 1"What is -it, dear?"I asked, as she held forth a small white box, nicely tied. Oh, tisn't much. Mother is kinder good to the poor, but she doesn't like to have me go to Sukey's; but she gave me ten pennies and I bought Sukey some snuff- she can't help liking it, Mis Blake-she has done it so long. When I was there the other day she said she wished she had some." So the dear little thing ran away, graceful as a young fawn, and Cutty and I returned to the parlor. I told Charles, of Lizzie and her beliefs-, and I was required to make a promise that he should see her ere lhe left. When we were seated, he asked, "Anne, how is it about this doctrine of fore-ordination, or whatever you call it?" I readily understood, and answered, ' I do not think God ever brought man into the world with a nature to- tally depraved, placing him in a state disadvantageous to purity; brought him here devoid wholly of self-voli- tion in the matter of his birth, then curses him. My neighbor comes upon the stage of life under far more favorable auspices than I; his path is flowery and smooth, mine rodugh and thorny. We were born equally de- praved, but his surroundings have saved him, while mine have doomed me. - Let us attribute mystery to the 7*   All-wise, but not injustice. Whlerein I am taught lie is not just, I rebel; wherein I am taught he is inscrutable, 1 am content."   '             - "Has the whole vast world-Adam's posterity-justly received misery for a sillngle act of his? I ana told by divines, God's ideas of justice are probably unlike ours." . "How we do strive to ignore the Deity within our- selves, my brother." "Well, Anne, this doctrine troubles mne verylittle; years since I discarded every pang of my soul for my infancy's teachings. I wish you might satisfy me upoil the particular point I have longed to have evening dawn that we might discuss." "Well, Charles, I have little to give you save that which comes from reason and intuition. I will do the best I can." "Can we really feel the presence of our lost ones, and seem to converse with them?" "My brother, give your affections and will to the elucidation. Throw aside prejudice, which is ignorance and let us remember Jesus upon the mount of transfigu- ration held converse with Moses and Elijah; and while Eliyah lay asleep under a juniper tree, behold, then, anl angel touched him and said unto him, 'Arise and eat.  Again, we read in Dan. viii, 15, 16, 'And it came to pass when I Daniel had been the vision and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. And I heard a man's voice be- tween the banks of Ulai, which called and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.' Socrates a,.;   lived constantly with his angel guides. They admon- ished him, lent him assistance, held in check his indis- cretions. How many have felt the presence of their departed ones! There is no monopoly in this blessing. You and I may talk with angels as well as they of the past-'tis no miracle.' (' Explain, Anne. I cannot understand." "A man can take nothing to himself except it be given him from above. Reichenbach has said, 'In pro- portion to a magnetos length flow forth luminous rays ;' some persons are so susceptible as to see these. So, my brother, striving to make ourselves the recipient of spiritual evidence causes a susceptibility; and sus- ceptibility makes vay' for the desire. Some persons can and do behold the return of those they love through strong susceptibility to memory and reminiscence, while others strive to grasp before they have prepared them- selves." "But the Spiritualists tallk of proper organizations- proper states." "Charles, I never saw the spiritual presence of Cecil, butI feel it daily; he goes hand in hand with me through the house, laughs, talks, caresses me-because, I am in the proper state, Cecil talks with me because I cast -away my external life. I forget the world. I reach up, and in proportion as I reac li up he reaches down to me. I hunger and thirst for knowledge of his life in heaven. Angels bring me food.

It requires the normal use of the spirit-   156        INTUITION. ual senses-harmonizing ourselves for the angel's ap- pearance. Let us withdraw behind our external selves- free ourselves from the thraldom of flesh. Oh, how often I sit me down in the still hours of night and call my darling to my arms! I forget earth and all its scenes. I know that my Redeemer liveth, but not as He lived when beside the dark grave I heard the man of God repeat inlstudied voice the words. Aye, He lives-near, so near, I almost see those blessed arms extended to welcome me to their embrace; saying, ' My child, you have done well; you have obeyed my voice.' AMy mind is receptive. I have passively yielded up the external, and the soul and intermediate part reigns. Then he comes, smiling soft and sweet. I kiss his lips, I caress his hands I cradle his head as of old and sing, 'Rock me to sleep.'" Charles had risen to a sitting posture. "Anne," he said thoughtfully, 1' it may be so. I know very well how this inner life strives to direct the outer, and how we rebel. I understand also of these successive emana- tions from God to angels-from angels to us-and from us as we will give to those lower in life's scale. If we would only live as they live, and give to others as they give to us, how quick His will would be done." Cutty said, "Oh, I understand it all now, and I shall try so hard .to give Lizzie all my knowledge, and I am determined to go every day to the cemetery and comfort those poor hopeless mourners; and as I give away my good, the angels will watch me-perhaps Cecil--and perhapismother and father and Johnnie can give me a   INTUITION.          157 little by this time, just as fast as I lose they will give me some more. That is the way Jesus Christ did. He laid down His life for the world; do you think that is what it means?" "Yes, dear. He gave much of his grace to others. He was brief in his benedictions; how precious his words were, ' Go and sin no more,' to that fair, beauti- ful woman in the temple. ' Go in peace.' 'Peace be unto thee.' 'Arise and walk.' How pregnant with love.- With the sentences went forth some part of the life so perfect. He said, ' The works that I do shall ye do also, and greater works than these shall ye do, be- cause I go to my Father.'  A knock, very gentle, came on the parlor door. I rose and opened it. It was Lizzie Holt, just returned from her charity, and arrayed in one of her new dresses; her eyes sparkled like stars, and her cheeks glowed like the heart of a ripe pomegranate. She walked in upon invitation, seating herself close by my brother. He regarded her with a good share of inquisitiveness. She has grown tall I thnk within the past month, and has had her flaxen hair clipped quite close to her head. I saw Charles smile while he gazed at her; and-I think she saw it, for she turned very quickly towards him, saying in her own brilliant way (I had introduced them to one another upon her entrance)-- "I am sorry you are sick." ("So am I," he replied. "Are you much sick?" she asked. "'I fear so. I am afraid I am very sick."   158        INTUITION. She mused a moment, then put allother interrogation. "Have you any little girls, sir?" Charles was weak, and reference to little girls touched his soul. He answered, "Yes, a lovely daughter about your age." I saw a tear glisten upon his lashes, I knew what his thoughts were-they were of that parting so surely coming; that adieu for which already the fiat had been sent forth. Recovering his self-possession in a measure, he walked to my side; sotto voce he said, "I should like to ask her some questions." I whispered, "Do so ;" and he resumed his seat. Lizzie and Cutty were talking about a fair which was soon to be in the neighborhood, and for which Lizzie was crocheting some beautiful toilette sets. The pro- ceeds to be appropriated to an orphan asylum in Bridge- way. I asked Lizzie if she had committed her Sabbath school lesson for the coming recitation. "Oh, yes," she answered very promptly, and pres- ently added, "I wish I was old enough and knew enough to write a new catechism." "So do I!" echoed Cutty, clasping her hands; " per- haps we will some day, Lizzie." '( What kind of one would you have?" asked Charles. ( The first thing I'd say, I'd say,' God is love. " "What then?" "I'd prove it." "What then?" "I'd tell little children, and big men and women, too,   IN-TUITION.         159 that all they had got to do is to love God with all their might and to do unto others as they would have others do to them. I would tell them if they told lies and did wicked things, when they died they would be very un- happy for it; but I would'nt tell 'em they must burn in hell forever. I would'nt have any figurative talk in it. I d say, remember God is all love, and if you don't do right you can't see him for perhaps a great many, many years. I'd tell 'em how angels cry 'cause we do sich wicked things, and how they talk together over those they see doing wrong, trying all the time to help 'em; perhaps 'tis their own folks that are the angels-those very own folks they loved so here. I'd tell 'em how they saw everything, and when they saw good actions they were so happy. I'd tell 'em if ever they thought they loved God well enough to be church members, they must truly be sure of it first, 'cause 'tis sich an awful thing to b'long to God's holy Church when you don't mean it. I'd tell 'em every day must be as good as Sunday, and that they musn't be cheating and telling lies 'bout things all the week to get money, and then when Sunday comes to put on all their best clothes and go to meeting and look so good, just as though they had been splendid ever since the last time they's there. I'd tell 'em they must be good to the poor orphans, and not pray for 'em, then not give 'em enough to eat, and -and-" she hesitated a moment, "I'd tell 'em the whole of it is this. To live so that when Gabriel comes, I believe it means when we die, they won't be afraid, but be glad, 'cause you see 'tis so beautiful in heaven,   160        INTUITION. and we shall have such good times talking 'bout what things we did here. I, mean to write a catechism one of these days." I said, "Lizzie, what would you teach the children about miracles?" "Oh, I would'nt have no miracles nor figurative lan- guage." "' What would you do, dear?" Cutty's face was all aglow with interest, and brother Charles appeared very thoughtful, gazing into the child's eyes with a perfect lust of covetousness. A babe was speaking intuitive instruction. "Oh, that's easy enough. I'd tell 'em God did them acts in some way those old patriarchs did'nt understand; some way that if we studied all things in his laws they. would'nt call 'emra miracles. I'd tell 'em they musn't ridicule what those Bible men said; but if they did'nt b'lieve it they must keep quiet and wait till they got old enough to study great books and nature, and find out if them men were right. But I should teach 'em most, of that something right in here, Mis Blake, I don't know what 'tis," she held her dimpling hands over her heart, " and tell 'em that told all they needed." "Intuition," exclaimed Cutty. "I know what it means." "Then you are not afraid to die," said Charles, gazing steadily at the child'. "No," she quickly answered ; , no-but then I ain't in any hurry.  I like the world and all the people,.:and the flowers and birds, and everything; but if God calls   INTUITION.         161 me, why then I am willing, 'cause I know it's all right, and I b'lieve the flowers and birds and trees are a great deal more beautiful there." "What do you expect to be like, Lizzie?"I asked. "Oh, just like what I am here, only a thousand times prettier; and I have thought it all over nights, how I will fly down to earth and off to the stars, telling all the folks I ever knew all 'bout their folks I have left. When I think I'm going to die, I shall send for all the people I know who have got angels up there, so I can carry lots of messages; and I'll tell 'em what their folks are doing here, and-and, oI, I can't talk 'bout it, it makes me want to go so! and I shall kcnow so much there." "Lizzie," I said, " who has taught you this?" "Oh!"She glanced towards Cutty with true homage in her eyes, and added, " she has answered all my questions so good and so true. You see I felt it, but couldn't exactly explain what this here did mean." She pressed her heart again, then leaned towards Cutty, who drew the dimpling fingers within her own, and Lizzie laid her rosy mouth to meet its response on my darling's lips. It was reverent worship for the teachler--an eloquence beyond all gladness. The sweet orphan who has come from out the storm and death of her youth, whose martyred days have been exiled, turned to me her eyes of beauty, and whispered, "Mother, 'tis all so simple we children can understand it well." My brother heard her, and reached out his arms. I   162        INTUITION. knew his soul was full. Both Cutty and Lizzie saw him, and both went to him. He drew a deep inspira- tion. I knew while their breath was upon his cheek, he was offering a voiceless prayer to God to speedily be- reave him of his straining, yearning agony. I knew he was ready to accept the grand and simple belief of the Father's little ones. Presently the two young Misses went up to Cutty's chamber, and I heard them laughing gaily--over some speech of Lizzie's, T had not a doubt. I am very happy to see how rapidly my dear adopted has been progressing in her true instincts of girlhood; she has been giving me each day, for many weeks, fas- cinating evidences of her lively nature. She and Lizzie are really the best of friends, and together plan their diversions. I have ceased to fear lest death take Hler from me because of her very exalted spiritual elements, and her marvelous endowments. Charles said, when we had been alone a few minutes, "Anne, it does seem as though the soul must find something to satisfy its longings. I have called myself a good Christian for years." "So did I, Charlie; but when death came and car- ried away my idol, I found I possessed a cold heart; that terrible chasm of separation-I could not bridge it over with my religion." "I understand, sister. I thought I was ready for anything. I have never neglected prayer or the church; I have been benevolent; have endeavored faithfully to obey God: but now when I know I must die, I awake   INTUITION.         163 from the dream-lo! I am empty where I believed I was filled." "My dear brother, every healthy soul is the true judge of its needs." "I need, Anne, what those two children possess. That little Lizzie has taught me a lesson. 01h! what would I give to change places with her! Anne, I have played hypocrite to self. I have lived-I see it so plain to-night-performing ceremonies, repeating creeds, and all the while with doubts in my soul. When death first stared me in the face, I commenced to flee for in- fallible- proof-something beyond dispute, of the great future. I have read and re-read my Bible; to find the great link betwixt the present and Eternity. I have dissected its pages, crying in miserable triumph over every inconsistency, contradiction, and false teaching of the ancients." "O Charles! how well I can understand you! It is my own experience, and that of thousands to-day, all over our land. Now, my dear brother, all you have to do is to roll the ' stumbling block' away. I take the portions which agree with my God-given reason, and thank the writers for the truths. If science has set at naught certain parts, I consider either those men who wrote were not versed in geology, astronomy, philoso- phy, or that sins of omission and commission come be- cause of lost manuscript, and errors ; also, translational and typographical errors, What of it? Let us turn 'to the New Testament, and follow the example of that   164        INTUITION. blessed, lowly Jesus in his tearful life from Gethsemane and Olive's mountain. ' Lo! I am with you alway,    : even unto the end of the world. " "But there, also, are inconsistencies and errors." "My brother, can we look for perfection in manu- scripts of men?" "But God inspired them." "Just as He inspires us of the present day. Of truth as we are ready recipients of it, and no farther. Some- times I have thought this, Charlie: that the philosophy of God is past finding out here; we have not wisdom sufficient to decipher those great subtleties." I did not see Lizzie advancing. She heard my last reply, and, going close up to Charlie's side, said- "Just don't worry 'bout that now, I'm so sure it's no use. I b'lieve if God would write us a Bible He'd write it so plain and easy a baby could understand it. This is my Bible." And she placed her hand above her heart again. Cutty had entered. "Please, Mr.-" She blushed deeply, and gazed at me. I encouraged her by smile and gesture to proceed. "Please, Mr. Dalton, God always gives to every one what they need. Oh! tell him, dear mother, all that you have told me!" My Cutty fairly stammered her last words, quite to the surprise of little Miss Holt, who, tossing her round head, coquettishy said- "Oh! who's 'fraid to talk 'bout sich things. I shouldn't think you'd be so seat, Cutty." Then the   INTUITION.           165 dear orphan blushed from the roots of her bronze hair to the linen collar at her throat. We sat together a while longer, then separated for the night.   "How sweet and soothing is this hour of calm!"Young says: "This sacred shade and solitude-what isit? 'Tis the felt presence of the Deity."   CHAPTER     XIII. TLTZZ E HOLT came over yesterday, and called Cutty out. They sat down upon the lowest step at the side door. It was almost twelve o'clock at noon, and I stepped to the window overlooking them, to invite Lizzie to tarry and dine with us. I did not intend to turn "eaves-dropper," but the child's face arrested and held me a moment. I saw she had been weeping. Cutty was winding her hands in and out of her white apron, evidently in some perplexity. Suddenly her delicate, spiritual nature seemed to change place with some quick impulse of anger, but as quickly subdued as dawning. I heard her say, "I would not care, Lizzie. I know 'tis hard, but then it will all come right some day." I heard Lizzie reply, "I wouldn't, only I'm 'fraid they will think I'm a real, great hypocrite. I told old Mis Orcut so, sure, I'd take her Belle ; and I teased mother all the morning to let me do it, and she said if I did she'd never call me her daughter again." "Let me tell mother." Cutty rose up with a motion seeming to say, " she'll advise and comfort you, Lizzie." "Well, tell her." (166)   INTUITION.         167 Both girls rose, and I, really warm in conscious guilt of surreptitious listening, hastened to the hall to meet them. At this instant I saw Mrs. Holt coming through the gate. Lizzie saw her also, and wiping her eyes endeavored to look happy. The children walked out among the trees towards the summer house, and I invited my neighbor into my sitting room. I quickly observed she wore an expression of unhappiness. She politely in- quired for my brother, also remarking her solicitude for his future. "After rather an uneasy half hour had passed--for Mrs. Holt was very abstracted, she evidently longed to get at her subject-I said, "Lizzie has done admirably for the fair." "Lizzie is smart, Mrs. Blake, but utterly ruined. I thought I never would trouble you again with this thing; but I calmot help it. I do not wish to offend you, Mrs. Blake, but I think I shall be obliged to forbid any further intimacy between Lizzie and Cutty. I have not known until within two or three days that the children talk so much of this false religion. I am quite shocked. Liz- zie never tells anything of what other people say, but Mr. James and Miss Duane were over last night and told me they were satisfied Cutty was ruining Lizzie with this terrible doctrine of making heaven a material place, and of talking of being saved through God's love, denying everlasting punishment, and such things. I think Cutty is a perfect little lady, Mrs. Blake, but children never should be allowed to have their own ideas of spiritual things. Mr. Holt has prevented me from   -168        I N T U T I O N. forbidding the children coming together so much, and he is more than lialf as foolish as Lizzie about such things." I sat very quietly, listening; the lady kept silence a moment, awaiting my reply, but I gave none. "I hope you are not offended, Mrs. Blake. I dreaded to say this." "Oh, no; not in the least," I answered, very softly. "But please, Mrs. Holt, will you tell me if you think Lizzie is a naughty girl?" The mother's face portrayed a perfect dilemma; then she said, hesitatingly, r " No, not bad in the sense people generally call bad, O no-but what can be much worse than for a child to have such dreadful ideas of religion? Why, Mrs. Blake, I never slept a wink all night after hearing what Mr. James said." "What did he say?"I asked. "He said, he trembled to think a child coming of christian parents, should believe she would go to heaven if she should die without being born again. He told her so, and she said, ' I have been born again. I'm born anew every morning and every night when I pray to God.' You know, Mrs. Blake, I told you, Lizzie always had her original ideas of religion; but she has grown out of all decency since she and Cutty have talked so much. Did Lizzie tell you of her last caper?" I smiled, answering, "She has said noth'g particu- larly new." "Well, Mrs. Blake, such things as this are what it   INTUITIONO         169 all leads to. Last Sunday I sent her to Sabbath school, as usual; she just runs in you know, the church is so near, to get a drink of water and get her books ; well she meets Norton's two children--illosc poor, miserable creatures-and asks them if they want to go to Sulday school. Of course they wanted to, and what does she do but march into the broad aisle holding one by either hand. 'I've brought you two new scholars.'  Miss Duane said that was her first warning of the new ac- quisition." "' Were they tidy, Mrs. Holt?" "Yes--"   She prolonged her affirmative, adding, "That is, as tidy as one can expect. They were clean enough, but were barefooted. Yes, Salhe said their clothes were neatly patched, and their hands and faces nicely washed, and their hair combed. But such things won't do. Why, Jennie and Alice Merton went straight into the next slip, refusing to remain a moment; ad Mary Stetson pulled her dress all up around her and commenced to cry. Sallie sent the Nortons home. Then Miss Lizzie was so offended she stood straight up before her and said, ' Miss Duane, did you know Jesus Christ was born in a manger? Did you know his father was a poor carpenter? So is Mr. Norton.' Well, you can see plain enough how these thinks work. Mr. James said he should turn Lizzie out of the Sunday school only for our sakes. I do a great deal for the church, and always give liberally when our minister has his annual donation." Mrs. Holt ceased her speaking, sighing very heavily. 8   170        INTUITION. I knew not what to say; but ere I had opportunity to decide she commenced again. "Did Lizzie tell you I had forbidden her to speak to Belle Orcut?" "No, Mrs. Holt. Lizzie is very discreet; she never has spoken of her troubles to me." "Well, I thought she would to-day, for she is much grieved. You know Belle Orcut is a great girl and has been dreadfully talked about. ' Why, she is sixteen, I know surely. They say she is trying +Q reform, and wants to go to Sabbath school. Lizzie promised Mrs. Orcut to take her and ask Mr. James to give her a place in her class. Belle feels ashamed of her ignorance, she is so large, and she thinks the world of Lizzie, so I sup- pose feels that to go with her would be quite a protec- tion. I have forbidden the plan. I'll never have my daughter seen  with Hiram  Orcat's poor, miserable child." The children made their appearance, bearing their arms full of flowers. I advised them to carry them down into the dining hall and arrlange them. I knew nothing of their intention. I said, as quick as they had left, "My dear Mrs. Holt, do not check your angel-like daughter in her impulses of true Christianity; do not, I beg, transform her into a cold creature of the cold world we make it. I shall not strive to argue points of the- ology with you; something tells me time will heal your unbelief. The children are very happy together. I would not separate them."   INTUITION.     171 The lady cast her eyes down upon the carpet, and said, "I do not wish to, I assure you; for Cutty has changed Lizzie beyond expression--softened her rude manners, taught her politeness and gentleness-though Lizzie will be herself as long as breath animates her body." lif D you ever fear she may become an angel early in life?" "eNo'! I am sure I do not; with such nonsense as fills her head!" Mrs. Holt blushed deeply, and left me very soon after this speech. I went down into the dining hall, finding the girls busy in fashioning wreaths, crosses, bouquets. I had forgotten the fair was to be on the morrow. Liz- zie was striving very hard to persuade Cutty to go. I sincerely hoped she might prevail upon her, but it was a failure. My darling adopted, I fear, ever will shun companionship with the world. She visits with me sometimes, and always meets company very cordially; but to place herself voluntarily among people seems wholly repugnant. Her young existence wraps itself in her studies and her new hope of heaven. Day after day passing is developing her marvelous genius, fitting her to take a  high place among earth's intelligencies. Her recitation hours come between nine and ten, A. M., and four  and five, p. M. Next week she commences music and drawing under Montzane. Another year I shall send her to Madame Royale's seminary in Chariestown. -While Cutty and I  were sitting together sewing, in the'afternoon just before tea, she told me of dear little Lizzie's grief at her thwarted intentions.   172        INTUITION. "She is so good," said Cutty tenderly; " she said she must have her mother's permission to all she did, else she would not honor her father and mother; but she  makes me laugh so:-, she says,' she'll bet the angels  will fix it up all right after awhile."'  Faith is rooted in innocency. A few days have passed and I have hardly seen Liz- zie. I fear Mrs. Holt has determined to keep the girls apart. Cutty is quite unhappy over her fears. She went out to swing, but came back declaring she felt so lonely she could not stay. She went into the play-house,  and says she almost cried aloud, it seemed as though X Lizzie was dead.                   . E t. . ,.. n r   CHAPTER XIV. I HAVE passed over a space called Time. I will not tell the hundred intents and little changes of those weeks and months. It needs not explanation, for to all come those minute parts that make up life. With the years beyond the Flood, lays the testimony. Mrs. Holt, wrought up to steel-like resolve by the in- cessant warnings of Mr. Jamnes, Mr. Blaisdell, and Miss duane, decided to take Lizzie away with her, for 1' rec- reation," she told me. I understood, and was prompted to tell her she might save hlerself the sacrifice, as I would keep Cutty's false doctrine in check; but upon second thought, which is always the wisest, I decided to obey silence. I pity dear Lizzie, ind when she came in to bid us adieu, it was with difficulty I could comrmand  calmness. Of course we laughed heartily ere she left. It would not be really meeting Lizzie un- less we did.  As she passed through the door she said, "What'll you bet this won't turn out figurative?" It is the Autumn  of the year. Cutty has been with me above eighteen months. O how she has changed inll this brief time. Her loveliness has seemed to reach its perfection. I imagine there rests upon her face the shade of her youthful endurance, the passion of her (173)   174        INTUITION. suffering. It gives her an intensely interesting appear- ance. Learning is to her soul a majesty to be reached high for; she strives hard to lift herself that she may grasp the stars of education and hold them firmly to her bosom. This vivid, devotional love for gain of good has made her precious to me. I love Cutty so well that each breath is fraught with benediction upon her head. She still continues her studies with me, and her music and drawing under Montzane. He prognosticated she would be an expert in either branch. As the space widens betwixt her days of bitter memory and the pres- ent of bliss, I can see how rapidly the true nature is displaying itself. She flits like a bird through the house, and leaves the perfume of her love in each separate apartment. In her fifteenth year, she combines full all the marvel the bud had promised for the opening .blos- som. She has in anticipation a boarding-school life. She must go in the Spring. Bleak indeed the house will seem after her departure, but I must not be -selfish. Although I have become very unpopular in the Church because it has been whispered that I believe I can talk with my angel Cecil, and because I have taught my Sabbath school scholars to widen greatly the answers in -the catechism, also have been accused of advocating the doctrine of progression, yet people do not shun me. I will not flatter myself, however; perhaps they court my society through curiosity, hoping I will say something startling. I have great faith in indirect influence. Have no doubt but that I am growing bold, for I have   INTUITION.       "  175 ventured to tell a few geological facts, and heard yester- day Mr. Browny, our superintendent, is coming to see me. I rather deal with him than Mr. James of the Baptist, Lizzie's enemy, for I really believe the former gentleman possesses the greatest amount of intelligence. Matters have changed regarding Cutty and Lizzie very materially. After a long absence, Mrs. Holt returned, accompanied by a neice of hers, but no bright-eyed little one. A few days subsequent to the news of the reopen- ing of my neighbor's mlansion, I met her on the street. She was very cordial; said she had left Lizzie at school in Haniford, Connecticut, near by her place of visiting. "How long will she remain?"I asked. "A year, we have stipulated for." As we were parting she bethought herself. "Oh! I have a letter-sent to Cutty. I think I have it in my pocket-yes, here it is. Please, Mrs. Blake, I rather Cutty would not correspond with Lizzie. Do not be offended, but you know we do not all think alike. I cannot accept such religious views as you hold, and I do not wish Lizzie to." "Very well," I said; " is she to reply to this one?" "Yes, if she pleases. I told Lizzie I was willing. And-and-Mrs. Blake," the lady blushed a little, "I have not heard this letter. She had sealed it, so I did not ask her to open it." "I think Cutty will be willing," I replied; " please walk over and we will listen to what dear Lizzie says." I observed that the lady complied rather reluctantly. She met Cutty with a very warm caress and unctious   176          INTUITION. kiss.  I really think Mrs. Holt greatly admires mly adopted.  The dear child was delighted with the letter, and I thought her face expressed a trifle of exclusive desire;' she felt Lizzie's communication to be her private property, but she read with some difficulty the chiro- graphy. "DEAREST CUTTY--It has not turned out figurative yet, but some- thing keeps whispering it will. Mother says I am an uncultivated, rude girl, and that a horrid idea of God and religion was born in me, and that I must try and get rid of it. She says I am totally depraved. I love my mother and s'pose she thinks she's right; but I don't b'lieve it. I know I am a great girl to know so little, and shall study hard to get some learning. Tell Belle Orcut I want her to read them notes I wrote her, and to b'lieve just what I told her, and she'll be all right. Mother got me a lot of nice things, but I never cared much, you know, for new dresses and the like. I'm afraid I haven't got a very good start in life, Cutty. Aunt Sarah says I'm wholly original, and wants me to get some kind of polish from society. I hope I can keep still 'bout the angels and the like, but if I hear anybody say anything 'bout eternal punishment, I shall talk and show how rude I am. I think Mr. James and Miss Sallie will feel better now I'm gone. I shall come home vacation and see you, Cutty. And now do you kiss Mis Blake twenty times for me, and kiss yourself a thousand.             LIZZIE HOLT." I was surprised to behold Mrs. Holt's stern cast of countenance. She was probably striving to restrain her indignation.   She appeared quite shocked when Cutty exclaimed," Oh! what a good letter I " and left us with- out one syllable of comment upon either the composi- tion or the compositor. She urged Cutty to visit her, and as a favor, asked just as she was stepping off the lowest stone, to see the reply to " that letter."

Just as the sunll was setting yesternight, I walked down the street to the post-office. I met Mr. Holt, bringing my mail-saw the black-bordered envelope, read the post-mark, and slied tears ere I gave the second glance at the messenger of bereavement.    Mr. Holt gazed very sadly at me when he bade me " good-day," touching his hat gracefully. I like Lizzic's father very much; he is a true gentleman, and I think we might agree nicely on matters of religion. I walked home, hastenled to my chamber, and read my letter. I had expected it ere this; for with each month since he left me had come tidings of his failing. Rapidly, within the past few weeks, I knew must have been his decline. I read, my heart beating fast, for I recognized his own hand. "DEAREST AND BEST OF SISTERS :-The doctor has told me to-day I eannot survive long, and desiring to forestall death, I hasten to give you my last.

I have received as I have made myself the proper recipient. You also said, 'Death is an arch-way crowned with hidden flowers.' To-day I respond, 'Amen!' It is the one step higher up-and I go to commence that development attained beneath the tuition of an- gels. I have only one reason to covet life; and that is, that I might go out preaching the faith which now supports me, to every creature. Oh, that sects would desist in their disputes, and head their creeds with, "ove is life. Harmony is heaven. Justice is sweet as mercy.' Oh, that they might read the Bible in its true meaning; accepting that which is bread and casting away the stone. But they cry, 'the whole or none ;' they will hang the mill-stone around their necks because science and the words of those ancient men do not agree; they will stalk towards the precipice of Infidelity because the Bible has been pronounced the only word of God, infallible, and up starts fact and reason to shadow the teachings of -their life. Bless God, I have cried for months, ' Eureka! Eureka!' Anne, my dearest sister, you planted the seed. My heart has ceased to throb because of unbelief and uncertainty. I know that my - Redeemer liveth. But now I must rest. "Evening. Agnes has propped me up by the table so I may continue my communication. My hand trembles and my head is weary. Come, angels, give me help for this work of love. Beautiful, truly beautiful is my calm, abiding faith-faith in the guidance of my soul by my lost Nellie ;* faith in the ceaseless outgushing of the Infinite love. Oh, hun- gering souls! The fountains of truth and reason are overflowing. 'Who- soever will let him take of the waters of life freely.' It is because people will not seek their needs; instead, they cling to old conventionalism-- what has been done for thousands of years must still be done, despite the cravings of the inmost nature for that which will satisfy true instinct and the progressive age. Give my love to those dear little girls-Cutty and Lizzie. Tell them though dead I will speak to them; tell them it requires not the verbal utterance or the real living presence; they have only to render themselves up into the passive state and they may see and hear me. St. Paul says, 'we are compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses.' I shall soon join the throng. And, Anne, darling sister, you may not know, will not know, when I go to that better land; but be expecting me, for I will come to you. Shall I tell Cecil you are making haste to be A first wife, who had been in the better land four years. /   INTUITION.           179 with him? I hear your affirmative response; and I'll not forget also to give him a good account of my visit with you;of which he already knows; but then, these matters are pleasant for mutual converse. The dew-drop rises for vapor, the flower dies for earth, but I rise to glorify truth, and rise through the starry world nearing each hour of time the holies of God. Good bye, dear Anne; good bye. If you come before Agnes, and you have sufficient warning of your journey, please bring me a kiss direct from her lips. She will go to you whenever you summon her, if it be possible. Adieu.       .  Your    CHARLIE." When I had finished reading I felt no disposition for tears. It was all so real, my mind was elevated into the fadeless radiance of God's love. I rose, calling Cutty. When she came, I read her the letter. "Beautiful!" she murmured with clasped hands and sparkling eyes. "I think he may see mother or father or Johnnie, perhaps all of them; he may be a teacher for them.  Why, truly, mother, sometimes I almost envy those who are going." For an hour my darling adopted sat at my feet and we talked of the past, the present, and the future; then Cutty ventured, "It is so long since we have had our questions and answers; please, let's to-night, precious mother." I consented; and she asked, "How shall I make it plain to Belle Orcut concerning repentance? She has finally decided, after all this long, long time, to go with me to my class; (the poor girl comes every day to my house to recite her lessons;) and she asked me day before yesterday, what I thought she must do to repent sincerely." "Repentance is reformation. The Greek is Metanoia,   180        INTUITION. denoting the remembrance of the soul's actions. Be careful in teaching her, Cutty, you do not give her the impression that if she'repents of the past it secures her against all punishment in the oncoming time. Effects linger, you know, long after the cause has ceased. There is nothing truer than Lextalionis, or the law of retalia- tion. ' Go, and sin no more ;' this was the love of Jesus for that repentant, chagrined woman. She went from the temple, we believe, purified in soul for the future-- purified in intent and purpose; yet the effect of her sin might follow her for a long time; until it become dis- tanced by space and the light she let shine before the world. Teach Belle she is forgiven the moment she resolves for true reform, but teach her to be patient until progression names her conqueror." "I will teach her carefully. I pity Belle, for I re- member my own shrinking from society. I have striven so very long to make her go with me. I think Miss Gregory is a good woman, and will receive Belle cor- dially; but the scholars are proud, and I say,' Now, Belle, you must not mind them, they will learn better one of these days.' She is so sincere--and I tremble every day lest she turn back to her old ways, for she gets not the slightest encouragement. To-day, when I was hearing her history, she seemed very, very sad, and I asked her what the trouble was. She said,' O Miss Cutty! every day I have my feelings hurt. It makes no difference to people, though you try ever so hard; if ever you were bad it will be remembered always; if they see you trying ever so hard to du well, they don't   INTUITION.         181 make any difference with you.' I told her, with good people it certainly did, and the unfeeling of earth she must leave in the hands of God. I suppose Belle has been a very bad girl." "Very, I fear; but, Cntty, let's you and I lead her up the steppes of heaven, if possible." Cutty smiled, answering, "We will, mother; but I am thinking how she does worship Lizzie Holt. Did I ever tell you what first startled her from her wicked- ness?"  "No, dear." "( She told me to-day, and I laughed and cried at one time-so like that little rogue. Oh! how I want to see her!  She was down by the mill brook sailing bits of shingles for boats, when Jimmie Doten and Fisher Cobb came along; you know there are no worse boys in the village; strange, when they have been brought up'so well. Jimmie said, ' Lizzie, do you know of any stream where a feller can catch something wortl while?' Her eyes twinkled, I'll warrant, when she answered, ' Yes; in the stream of life.' ' Oh! darn the stream of life, responded Jimmie; ,it's too long and has too many crooks in it.' 'In them crooks you catch the best fish.'" "A speech wise enough for a  sage," I said; "and what a child that Lizzie is?" "Fisher had a nice piece of cake, eating; taking a huge mouthful, he threw the remainder into the water; whereupon Lizzie said, ' Cast thy bread upon the waters, and after many days it shall come back.' Fisher added   182        INTUITION. quickly, ' But so darndly soaked what's the use of its returning? Lizzie, what does that mean?' ' Its fig- urative,' she replied, with a merry laugh; 'but my Sab- bath-school teacher says it means, to do good, and after awhile you'll get a reward.' ' That reward's the prin- cipal thing with them church people,' said Jimmie; ' whatever they do, the item is the reward, you know.' After a time, Belle, who had been standing behind a tree, waiting for the boys to go on, for she feared their revilings, was weary with her delay, and came forth; she must pass very near them. As she expected, Fisher and Jimmie commenced to taunt her, calling her Mary Magdalene and many a harsh name.  She turned upon them, cursing them, and threw stones. Lizzie said, ' Now the one that is without sin, cast the first stone back at her.' They laughed uproariously, but seemed little inclined to retaliate. Lizzie ran after the poor girl, and found her crying. She just put her hand through Belle's arm, and told her it was too bad-they were wicked boys, and that angels would feel dreadfully sorry to see how cruel they were to her. Poor Belle was completely melted. She told me it was the first time she ever had felt a real desire to be good. She said she hated people who called themselves pious, and when they passed her, looked at her so cross and con- demning-like; drawing up their clothes as though if they hit her they would be contaminated. But Lizzie so impressed her, she said to me, with tears in her eyes, she had the first faith in goodness that ever dawned into her cheerless soul. She said she thought that,   INTUITION.         183 could she be like Lizzie, she would gladly suffer much for her past sins. It was at that time Lizzie projected taking her to Sabbath-school, and Mrs. Holt forbade it. You remember we endeavored to win the girl afterward, but failed, until we offered to instruct her in the com- mon English branches.  Though I strive so hard to lead her, she thinks more of two little notes she got from Lizzie, than all else in the world." "Did you ever read or see them, Cutty?" "No; she prizes them as sacredly as we should the relics of a loved one who has gone to heaven." a Belle is very sensitive." "O very, mother." "I think, Cutty, I will see your teacher ere the Sab- bath comes, and give her a little advice. I wish my class was not so full." "Well, mother dear, can we have just one more question to-night?" "Yes, darling, what is it?" "I never have classified my interrogations; -would it have been better? I have asked as the spirit won- dered." "No, dear, I think it is quite as well to follow the needs of the mind." "Do you think we shall eat in the next world?" "Elijah passed forty days without material food, and Moses on the mount; Jesus in the wilderness of Beth- saida, was sustained on spiritual nourishment." "How is it, mother?" "The spiritual world contains, I believe, invisible   184        INTUITION. essences of material things; inl fact, materiality is only the ultimate expression of the spiritual life. In this case we get the most delicious parts there." "Perhaps we can turn whatever we will to our de- sires; perhaps make something delightful to drink of air. You know Jesus turned water into wine. How did He do it?" "My dear, I have always thought those acts called miracles were but the harmony of natural law; they must have been the exhibition of high law not under- stood sufficiently for most persons to avail themselves of. A mind of great mesmeric power has been known to impart to water the specific forces of a medicine. This we have had proof of; why, then, could not Jesus, with His great creative force, turn water into wine? The whole realm of nature is subjective to spirit, and all phenomena in the material world are the effect of spirit. Let us remember this, and everything is in a soluble state for us." "One more, please, mother. Do I weary your pa- tience? but you know now so quick we must part." "Well, Cutty, go on."   I did not like reference to the oncoming separation. "In my lesson this week, there is a question I cannot answer. It is to tell Jesus' meaning when He said, 'All Mine are Thine and Thine are Mine.' What shall I say?" 'u My dear, I think it is one of our highest duties to be innocently happy, because we impart such an influ- ence to those around us; through the law of mind act-   INTUITION.          I[5 ing upon mind there is a great tendency to make those about us like ourselves. I think those words of our blessed Jesus will be realized when we, at the ex- pense of selfish aims and ends, follow abnegation, and accept the thorn and give the rose, rather than keep the rose and give the thorn. Shall we be happy in the so- ciety of angels unless we can accept the beauties of their lives? Let us crystalize into sparkling gems, the tear-drops of the wearyh earted ; let us sing songs of mercy to earth's stricken ones; let us be practical re- formers in every sense, not for praise of men, but for the approbation of our own souls and the peace of heaven." Cutty thanked me with one of her sweetest kisses- a thousand times more eloquent than all the words of gratitude she could have offered. Then she went to study her French lesson for the morrow, and I went to my chamber. Sitting down, I read several pages in Jeremy Taylor's Holy Living. I admire that man's honesty of character. His genius was marvelous, and his familiarity with the different emotions of the human heart truly wonderful. I    CHAPTER XV. THS lovely autumn morning the' Sabbath bells peal forth their expectant voices. People have commenced to pass my window on their way to the new church. The old meeting house is numbered with things that have been. I remember it well, while thnking-the tall, nar- row belfry, with its great bell, and shelter for iridescent plumaged birds,---the small paned windows, with the sunlight streaming in and over the high-backed pews, and the pulpit, reached by a flight which would do jus- tice to our modern houses,--the singing seats, filled with the fresh faces of the lads ani lasses, all our own, while old Mr. Temple, with moie labor than grace, brought out the bass from his viol. Now when I enter -our new church, I am lost in a deep twilight, and must accustom myself some moments to the darkness ere I can distinctly trace the great arched windows, the angles and curves, the rich color and sculpture, the or- naments and figures-faithful representations as hu- manity can conceive of His immaculate loveliness. I ask myself, has all this been effected in the very wan-, tonness of wealth? does heaven's light, wandering from the far away casements, casting phosphoric strands upon the congregation here and there, behold hearts as well (186)   INTUITION'.         187 as heads? There is a message in each shaft of your church, a sermon in each stone, warning in each tapestry, judgment, lest ye be careful, in each slip. Do these people see in the colors of their church the white faces of the poor and hungry? '"Who sells doves for sacri- fice?" Is there a man who enters that great arched portico who carries the counter of his trading-house even to the altar? God forbid! Did they pass upon the road any child, or youth, whose eyes were heavy 'with the glances of desperation aid stony depravity? whose throats were hoarse with cursing? Were there any places with closed doors, closed shutters, a Sunday calm resting upon the external, while the internal was a scene of gambling, snarling, fighting? Go on, churchman and churcllwoman, to sit beneath the towering pillars of oak and the pictures of Christ and his disciples. But the people have commenced to pass hurriedly over the green. It is a sin, perchance, yet I cannot refrain from scanning them, because I am in such a marvel. The profession and the life. That group attracts me. Mr. Snlith and his two daughters-they dress elegantly. Their father is trus- tee of the widow's and orphan's large donation from our good Mr. Burke. Just behind them I see Mrs. Green and her son; ah, a new silk; well, now that I think of it, it must be the same that Clara Gurney sat up to finish last night. When she came for milk this morning, she looked very pale and her eyes were badly swollen. She said she sat up until nearly three o'clock to finish Mrs. Green's new silk, because she must have it to wear to.   188        'INTUITION. day. She said she left Mrs. Green's at seven, the hour her day's work should have ceased, and took the dress home to finish. The'lady gave her, as usual, good pre- cept. Her lips moved very gently to the orphan seam- stress. "My dear, ' Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy."'" Her son has just returned from Eng- land. He is most fastidiously arrayed in exceedingly tight pants, lavender kids, the very essential optics, the slenderest cane; ah, he meets Miss Tipman: raises his hat. Jennie, who has just come up to do the chamber work, looks out. She exclaims, "That man thought he was a girl this morning when he parted his hair." I suggested a cowlick; but Jennie, quite indignant with the " young men of the period," declared Brindle did not get loose to entail upon herself the coxcomb's apol- ogy. Miss Tipman bows very low, exclaiming, a Was fur ein schoiner morgen! " Aw," he replies, " vewy!" and they pass on. Next, I see a dashy turnout. Doctor Bigman and family. Suky Black hobbles quite in the rear of this fashionable coach. Last Wednesday she came to me with a paper for her relief, headed by several Christian ladies. Shle owes the doctor fifty dollars for attendance upon her only child, who now sleeps his last sleep in Potter's Field. "Because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me;" vice versaa. Next, walks in all the pomp of color, quantity, and perfume, the family of Lawyer Marston. Last Spring he attached widow Cobb's cottage, and without a mur-   INTUITION.         189 mur she went into the bleak old tenement away out by the blue hills. This self same dignitary gave to the new church Reverend Jonas Holmes' background- Christ feeding the multitude. It is a pleasure perchance for the poor widow in the extreme rear of the edifice to gaze at the loaves and fishes, especially when no mli- racle multiplies her own meagre loaf. Toll-toll-toll. Heaven forgive me for my half-hour of sinful scanning the parish. I will arise and do pen- ance. Hastening across the green, I enter the arched portal, walk up the aisle and kneel. "God bp merciful to me a sinner." Cutty is already in the slip, with a stranger beside her. Belle Orcut, as I live! robed in clean calico, and looking about her with a. very fright- ened air; she shrinks, and leans towards my darling adopted as if for protection. The new organ peals-the chosen choir commence their chant. Listen--"  Know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment."   Up, up, through the great arches echoed the words; were they difficult of interpretation? in their sadness of soul, in their strength of assurance, could they be misunder- stood? Every face bore complacency. I saw no eyes wavering, no lips quiver. It must be well with the peo- ple of God. Belle glanced shyly over those nearest her, and I gave her a smile hoping to render her more at ease; then I pushed the cricket close beneath her feet; she wore a pair of gaiters much too large-probably the prunella did dual service in the family. She has rather a pretty face, but so piteously forsaken. C r ..   1'9U        INTUITION.  The minister was reading.  "Blessed are ye that  : hunger now, for ye shall be filled." 'I Blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh.7 . .. n" and as ye  would that mien should do to you, do ye also so to them." .... "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father  is also merciful "--and the man of God read on to the  end of the chapter. I saw the same complacent smile  i upon the faces of the congregation, excepting poor Suky, K who leaned forward drinking in the words of her Alas- - ter with avidity. Mrs. Cobb looked as though the   E twenty-first verse awakened within her an anticipation of something in that better land which has been a stranger to her ever since the death of her husband; also her children hungering now, should be filled tlhen. After a brief prayer, the choir sang- "So let our lips and lives express The holy gospel we profess; So let our works and virtues shine To prove the doctrine all divine." I heard Mrs. Martin's moire antique rustle, and caught a glimpse of her eyes turned towards my slip. I expect- she thought I had brought Belle Orcut for the express purpose of proving the psalm. The house was hushed.  How many bowed heads! A perfect sea of fifty and seventy-five dollar chignons, rarest French flowers, tulle, satin, point lace collars, gold necklaces, shoulders cov- ered with stuffs, u mighty in duties." Mr. Holmes had commenced: "OUR FATHER WHCH  ART IN BEAVEN, HALLOWED BE THY NAME, THY KINGDOM  COME, THY WILL BE DONE ON EARTH AS IT IS DONE IN  I0 L   ^^AU A v lln.        191 IEAVEN." The usual preamble over, he prayed for the inner, for the sick, (the doctor looked interested-I ould see his face,) for the bereaved, (the undertaker noved uneasily,) he gave thanks for the great crops, farmer Baldwin coughed,) lie asked for mercy and race craved help for the orphan and widow, (Judge rench's hand fell from the rail of the slip to the lapel f his pocket,) he petitioned for humility, (very many owers and chignons trembled,) he earnestly plead for ie prisoner and those in the toils of debt, (Suky's gro- er took his head up very nervously). How did I be- old all this?"Judge not lest ye be judged." I knew ,yet I wanted to find, if possible, by manifestation of ovement, whether the heart was so subtle and self- 3ceiving as to turn away from all warning, accepting ily the misinterpreted light which they love to lean wards.  I think I did detect the knowledge of " pass- ig by" on the other side.  Priest and Levite, mer- ant lawyer, doctor, grocer-have ye studied the plan redemption?  know ye the mystery of sin's punish-    i Bnt?  Another chant by the choir. Then the minister, ris- before his people, told them  Christ said, 'Thou alt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and th all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with thy mind;   and thy neighbor as thyself." Mrs. rtin's antique rustled again, and I saw her looking vards Belle; had I  brought this poor, depraved thing o that fashionable church to prove text, psalm, and yer  ? And the congregation listened. It meant, to 1 .i   19'2        INTUITION. teach the hleatheln, to visit the sick, bind up the wounded heart, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, be humble, merciful, loving, to lold the feet of the tired Magdalene in sure places. The service was over. The congregation passed down the soft-carpeted aisles and out into God's beautiful day. The children of the Sabbath-school took their respective places. Cutty, holding Belle Orcut by the hand, walked towards the superintendent: "Please, sir, may I take this young lady into my class? I think there is a vacancy, and feel quite pos- itive Miss Gregory will not object." The superintendent scanned -the girl from head to foot, then over again, while she blushed and cast her eyes down, and turned towards Cutty a glance of plead- ing for protection. "I hardly know," he replied, slowly, (he recognized Belle); "I think perhaps she better go into Miss Crane's class." "But they are all so small," remonstrated Cutty-- and she well knew they were the picked poor of the village. ("She will require elementary teaching." "No sir. I have taught her the first catechisms; she X  can go into mine."  Cutty stepped very close to the superintendent, and whispered, "I have had such a hard time to get her here!" "Very well, she can go into your class to-day." Belle appeared relieved, and followed my darling quietly. Miss Gregory smiled, receiving the stranger politely. Ellen Craige and Anna Wilkes drew their   INTUITION.         193 dresses closely about them and gave a significant smile. Fannie Phillips spoke sharply as the clean calico swept the elegant blue silk, "Please, I'd like to move my seat." Poor Belle could endure no longer, and burst into tears. She whispered to Cutty, "I will go home. I never want to go where Christians are again, so long as I live. I hate that prayin' superintendent and every- body else here. Through the whole meeting time those grand people looked so cross at me, and when I come out they looked at my dress and held their's away lest they touch me.  I rather have my wickedness than such make-'blieve religion." Miss Gregory was left in a peculiarly embarrassing position. She is very popular with her scholars and the church generally. She must not risk her reputa- tion. She considered but a moment, and changed places with Fanny Phillips. She opened the question book, closed it, opened the Bible, closed it, coughed, then excused herself to speak with the superintendent. Ever and anon their eyes were directed to Belle, and she saw them. Presently Miss Gregory returned, and Cutty readily understood the dilemma. They must not offend the class, and they must not offend me or wound Cutty's heart. So, whispering something to either one of the scholars, an act not too astute to deceive the poor girl, the lady opened the book and commenced the lesson. Belle motioned to rise and go, but Cutty pulled her back, saying aloud, "Please do wait for me, Miss Or- 9   194        INTUITION. cut," at the same moment giving a glance of earnest pleading. It was sufficient, and a trifle of indignation had taken the place of former grief. The old antago- nism for fashionable religion rose within Cutty, and she whispered in Belle's ear, "Do not care for them. I wish Lizzie Holt could be here." Belle smiled. The teacher read the verse leading the lesson: "He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth Him that sent me." "Miss Cragie, whose words are these?" "They were given by Jesus Christ to men appointed to go out and preach the gospel." "What is their meaning, Miss Wilkes?" "That whosoever will not receive His ministers will not receive Him." A quick, sharp voice added, "u That whosoever will not receive His poor casts Him out." Miss Gregory blushed deeply, and said, severely, "Answer only when I glut a question to you." Forbearance had ceased to be a virtue with Belle, and she received the reprimand stoically. Cutty saw a reckless desperation in her face, which frightened her. "Miss Phillips, read, if you please, St. Luke 10, 25th verse." v^p   She read, "And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted Him, saying, ' Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?' " "Miss Cutty, what is the meaning of Jesus' re- s--  ply?"   INTUITION.         195 With extreme emphasis my darling repeated the an- swer in the question book: ' That our love for God must be fill and sincere, and our love for our neighbors should be equal to the love we have for ourselves." Fearful lest Cutty expatiate in the least, Miss Greg- ory hlurriedly said, "Isabel Orcut, read the 30th verse, if you will." Belle's face colored painfully. She quickly observed 'the disparity in the manner of putting the interroga- Ition, but she read plainly, "And Jesus answering said, ' A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his rai- ment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.' " "Very well. Miss Jones, what did those who came along do?" "Passed by on the other side." "But who tarried, Miss Simpson, to relieve him?" "The good Samaritan." "Read the 36th verse, Miss Wilkes." "Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves?" "What did Jesus say, Miss Cutty?" "Go and do thou likewise." And so the lesson ran, until it was concluded. Then the superintendent prayed that the good Father would sanctify the truths committed to the young hearts ; the assembly rose, singing a hymn of praise, books were distributed, and they all passed out-those nearest Belle Orcut giving her a wide berth, and comforting her with   196     .   INTUITION. divers tossing of heads, whisperings, smiles of derision, glances of scorn. Fresh from their sermon and lesson of "Love thy neighbor as thyself," these youthful souls accepted their false education, their destroying example, and passed on, treading that path full of self-reared thorns whose piercings must cause so many cries of bitterness and the flow of immeasurable acrid tears. Mothers, teachers, friends, can you not remember this pampered existence is but the crude development for the second state, but withal the bud from which blossoms the progressive ages of Eternity? When Fannie Phil- lips and Belle Orcut shall have languished from Death to the real Life, who shall say which accepts the hands of those once so great and courted on earth, the hands that shall lead up to the thrones of Itriumphal happiness! Belle went to her home crushed in spirit; hating God's professed people, the church a mockery, Christians hypocrites. But she had faith in sweet Lizzie Holt, and wept for her absence. Never again could Cutty or I persuade her to enter our grand church.    CHAPTER    XVI. Mr. Mackenzie called this morning. I was surprised, for I had not heard of his return from the East. I had met Phebe and Hope several times in the interval of his absence, and it may have been chimerical, but it ap- peared to me Hope was sick with hope long deferred- so I inquired with some anxiety of the gentleman. "Quite well, Mrs. Blake-or at least as well as she ever will be beneath her trials. I would not hesitate to elope with the girl, Mrs. Blake. The old gentleman has worn me out with his wilful obstinacy. He knows bet- ter; but Hope is a good daughter-she never will dis- obey her father. I have not been to the house since my return." "Possible!"I exclaimed. "Yes, madam; very possible." "I think you did visit there?"  "Yes, a few times; but the last evening I spent with them previous to my departure, I said in deacon Wilber- force's presence, ' Death is incapable of changing the real manll-that one who dies to-night is the same to- morrow morning as to-night.' "He answered, ' The book of life will be opened and you will be judged, sir, if you die to-night. If you hlave (197)   198        INTUITION. done well, you go to the right hand; if not, to the left.' "I answered, ' Our own being, I believe, is the book of life.' uc Benighted man!' he groaned, ' God help you. I tremble for you. Supposing this n:'ght, young mlan, thy soul be required of thee.' "'Very well,' I replied; ' Mr. Wilberforce, I should go without a fear. I rather live. I want to live as long as I can. I want to raise myself as high in all virtues as possible, so that my condition there may be a pleasant and benefitting one. My soul is ernraptured, sir, when I think of going forth with a good foundation, and of the rapid advancement I shall make. I believe ac- cording to the type of energy each individual pos- sesses is the perfection he will attain.' "The deacon answered me emphatically, Mrs. Blake, I assure you. "' Henrique Mackenzie, remember you never will change a hair after you leave this world. If you are wicked you will go to hell, if you are good you will go to heaven; there is no half way work about it' '"Unqualified?' "' Unlqualified, sir.' '"Are there different heavens? ' "' No, young man; heaven is heaven, and hell is hell.' "' Then if I sin a little, and my neighbor sins a great deal, we both go to the same place of torment, and suffer alike.' "'Yes, Henrique Mackenzie; if ye offend in one jot or tittle of the law ye might as well offend in the whole.'   INTUITION.         19 9 "'Then, deacon Wilberforce, if I tell a lie, I shall not be any worse off if I murder somebody.' "' God will take care of that,' replied the old gentle- man, anxious to dismiss the point. "'And you believe, deacon, we suffer in hell for ever and ever, through an incomprehensible eternity.' "' Of course we do-or sing in heaven. I expect to sit upon the right hand of God.' '"Through an Eternity, Mr. Wilberforce?' "Yes, sir.' "I answered, I Heaven deliver me! I rather suffer the possible changes misery may bring, than the incom- prehensibly dreary monotony of sitting and singing and crying hallelujah through an Eternity.' "' Young man, I tremble for you! How dare you close your eyes nights? Aren't you afraid you'll wake up in torment some morning?' "' No, deacon; not a particle. If I should be taken during the night, the morning would probably find me endeavoring to ascertain my vital relations to that better world, and considering my best method of procedure to reap the fullest and speediest good. The morning, I have not a doubt, would find me in reception of the greeting of many friends. Oh, the thought! Folded to the arms of my mother, who has long been an angel; perchance she would say, v Henrique, my son, I have waited--what to you would be a long, long time, but I I have been so greatly engaged, to me, the interval has been almost brief-but come to the home I have made ready, the home where we will be re-united.'   200        INTUITION. "The deacon groaned, repeating, 'home I have made ready! Do you expect people have homes there-sepa- rate homes?' "'Yes sir, I do. I can see no reason why they should not.' "'And do you suppose she talks in that earthly way?' '4 What should she say, deacon-how should she talk? ' 1"Henrique Mackenzie, if you ever repent, are born again, are baptized and join the church, and get to heaven, you will find your mother (provided she was a Christian) praising God before the great white throne.' s' What is that throne made of, deacon?' "' Why, you know what the Revelations say.' "' What do you think it is?' ' Oh, replied the old gentleman, prolonging the in- terjection, ' it may be made of marble and gold, or ivory and precious stones or some such thing. I suppose 'tis really very beautiful.' 'It will be a great pleasure to examine it, deacon, and converse with naturalists concerning the different stones and gems.' "'Oh, Henrique Mackenzie! what shockingly material ideas you have of such things. Do you suppose people there converse on science?' "' WMho made the throne, deacon?' ' It was made Without hands-eternal in the heavd ens.' "' Well deacon, chemistry has shown us that all solid bodies may exist aeriformly-may be converted into in-   INTUITION.         201 visible gases-so perchance the materials of te throne may 1lave become volatilized and passed upward through space, becoming condensed again up there. We are told that in the remote distances between the planets there is no inactive void. If then these spaces of ether are filled with attraction of matter, we may hlave all the elements for house-keeping.' "'Henrique Mackenzie, you never shall mnarry my daughter, never! I desire you to leave my house.' "' Deacon Wilberforce,' I said calmly, ' memory is imperishable-you may regret these words some day; though ages may pass away, these very words may rise with a stinging consciousness; our acts and words here will persist there in a review; we here suspend remem- brance, sir, but it is reproducible, and each scene of life here will be reproduced there with vividness. Deacon, I never can convince you of my true heart here, but there I fear you will regret having banished me from yourpresence. I will go, promising never to enter your house again except by invitation from you; but I shall not promise to cease wooing your daughter at every op- portunity.'  "Very well,' the old gentleman replied, bowing his profoundest, and I left, Mrs. Blake. I would run away with Hope to-morrow if she would go, or to-day either." Scarce had Mr. Mackenzie finished his sentence when Jennie came up, saying, "Deacon Wilberforce had sent in great haste for Mr. Mackenzie." The latter gentle- man exchanged strange glances with me, hurriedly bid- ding me " good morning," and I await the sequel. 9*   "VfM        INTUITION,  Cutty is making some ginghamn aprons for Adolphus Groom's children, and I must go and cut olut the arm holes. Dinner has passed and the afternooll is beautifuil. I sit and sew, wolldering lwhat kind of a scene they have had at the deacon's. Tea time. Jennie tells me Chlloc Mayday,v who has been calling in my kitchen, says Mr. Wilberforce had a dreadful attack of cholera last niglt, and this morning the doctor despairs of his recovery.  The mystery is solved-the deacon desired Hellnrique's forgiveness, and a favor, gift of gratitude, I sincerely  lope may come in the form   of a pleasant face, true heart, useful hands, and trim little body. I find I am filled with childish impatience to ascertain the result allnd have endeavored to persuade myself it is no vulgar  curiosity but a real desire for the happiness of two long- ing hearts. Hope is so dutiful and so patient, and looks so wistful. I suspect Henrique censures her sometimes  for such marvelous obedience-she told me as much. I often wonder at Cutty's tractability, and the eager- i iess with which she grasps every attempted art, sur- prises me.  Beside her English lessons, she studies  Inmusic, French, and has become almost worthy to accept tile name "Artist." She has been painting  a young  face wreathed in lilies and deep green leaves., Thoughf far from perfect, I see high promise gradually rising be- neath her hand out of the dark opaque background. It truly beguiles mne to watch the dear child, often snatches   INTUITION.         203 me from saddening memory; when I remember the golden hours with a sigh, her unwearying devotion to her art teaches me devotion to my never failing help and hope. She has promised to paint Cecil from a small but faithful picture I have. "Only wait a little and I will do him splendid!" she often exclaims. Oh! bless the day I went to that pauper house! When she leans over her easel I behold an infinite charm in the innocent and almost religious veneration of her work-her countenance changes as by magic, her cheeks flush, her eyes are filled half with purpose, half with admiration for her crude execution; then again I have seen her lashes wet with tears and a look of disappointment and shame cover her features. She has failed in some important point. At these times I pity her profoundly, for she is not easily discouraged, and I know her cause weighs much with her. But in this last pattern she certainly is surpassing herself. Another morning has dawned. I had breakfasted and was dusting the parlor furniture, when, glancing through the blind slats, I saw some one coming up the walk. Henrique, as I live! He met me with a laugh and an apology. "Must leave town, Mrs. Blake, for several weeks, and much desire you (if you have leisure) to assist Hope in her bridal wardrobe. Go to Boston with her, eh?" I promised, and he went into the parlor. "How is Deacon Wilberforce?" "Better this morning."   204        INTUITION. "He has forgiven you? "Yes, heartily." "A miracle, Mr. Mackenzie.' "There are no miracles-all things are plain in na- ture. Mrs. Blake, Deacon WTilberforce is a very kind hearted gentlelman. I must tell you. In fact I could not leave until I hlad communicated to you my good for- tune. The day I left you, I went, as summolned, im- mediately to the house, finding the deacon very sick in- deed. The momlenlt  entered he extended his hand towards me, saying, ' Henrique, comle here-sit down;' turning to Hope and his wife, he said,' Leave me alone with him.' When they had gone he looked at me, and imploringly whispered- "' Henrique, wlhat was it you said about our future?' "' Mr. Wilberforce,' I answered, ' Man szhall reap as he has sown.' "' Yes, yes, I know; but do you really believe we shall have an opportunity to outlive sills which the best of us commit? do you really believe, Henrique, I may have a chance to ameliorate my condition just a little, if no more?' "I replied,' Time will give you the privilege to raise yourself as high as your energy and inclination prompt.' "He, said,' mWe all go out with so many fears. 'Tis indeed dreadful to think we must remain in a fixed state through eternity, when we so regret that we are not farther advanced; and, Henrique, have you proof suffi- cient that-that we may-perhaps be like ourselves here-that is, to feel interested in those we leave; and   INTUITION.         205 what is it about meeting again, to be as we have been lere-only so mnuch better and happier, and all that? After all, my mind is not quite clear, and when one is almost ready to step forth, they do desire something a little real. I want some kind of a definite idea, Hen- rique.' "'I would not reproach you, deacon,' I said; ' but you have pronounced me an Infidel for desiring this same thing. I want it to become an established princi- ple within me, so when I am called I can go without adding mental pain to the pains of death. You have been a Church member, a deacon, for years, why do you fear?' "' Henrique, I have been inconsistent, dishonest, and a hypocrite unto the world and self. Oh! if I might only live two short years more, how different would be my life. Is there such a thing as atonement when we are just stepping out? I cannot tell my wife and daughters, but, Henrique, will you give widow Grant a hundred dollars, and those two orphan nieces of mine five hundred, and O, Henrique, I never half paid-Oh! I can't breathe very well-don't forget-don't forget, H ought to give a good deal to John, I never paid him enough, and his children go cold-cold; and-Oh! I am dying-I am afraid, listen quick, Henrique: give Suky Black back that hard earnt money she paid me for wood, and-and-call my wife-no, here, quick! be my exectutor; don't tell them, but look up all the people I have wronged, and teach Hope what you please- Phebe, too, and my wife; and, Henrique, you think we   206        INTUITION. are neither doomed to be stationary in heaven, or hell. I believe at last I'd rather go to hell with a hope of ris- ing higher and higher, than to heaven and remain in a fixed state. Talk to me, Henrique-you may have Hope-only talk to me of the future. Tell me some- thing real; call them- I am going.' "He sank away in a swoon-the effect of fear and anxiety, I believe. We sent for the doctor, who rescued him, and to-day the deacon is much better. He will re- cover, I have not a doubt. I remained with him through the night and he would not sleep, but kept up one inces- sant train of inquiry. I told him if he did not forget it, and if he ever chanced to meet Helen Mackenzie (she is my mother,. Mrs. Blake,) to tell her her son longs to meet her. "' But she cannot be the same as she was here,' he said, after I had shown him a beautiful picture of her, I always wear next my heart; have I ever shown it to you, Mrs. Blake?" "No. I would much like to see it." "Presently, please. I told the deacon, I believed she was the same in every particular, save her spiritual body would be beautified. I asked him how he expected to recognize his friends hereafter if they did not possess those same individual and distinctive qualities they pos- sessed here. I suppose he thought he would be obliged to go inquiring around and then learn to remember that was the real person. He expected to meet angels with wings and bright faces-a group having no separate characteristics of countenance, and after a time he   INTUITION.         207 might possibly distinguish his friends from the dozens of other angels. So it was through the night. I could plainly perceive he was growing more comfortable each minute, but he was satisfied of the presence of the death messenger." "Will he, after recovering, cling to these latter things, or retrograde to his fundamental religion, Mr. Mac- kenzie?" "He has had experience, Mrs. Blake, he has known the needs of the death hour, and if he forgets he entails upon himself a second trial." "And so you really have found peace at last, Mr. Mackenzie." "Yes, my dear madam; and now if you will be kind enough to advise her-her people are bigoted on other subjects aside from religion." "I understood the gentleman perfectly well, giving him a promise to do many favors for Hope. "All's well that ends well," he gaily said, when he bade me "good day." "When he had gone, I went up stairs and sat down to reflect upon the strange, ways of this strange world. Cutty came presently, bringing her books, and we en- joyed two hours of quiet; after which, I rehearsed Mr, Mackenzie's experience, to the infinite delight of my darling. Clapping her hands, she exclaimed, "Oh, if Lizzie Holt had only been with the deacon!" I Il                     '   CHAPTER     XVII. DOWN come the first snow-flakes of the season. Pale sky and chilly breath of November. Through the woods and along the meadow-land sighs the genius of the whirlwind, risinghigh among the disjointed cliffs and barren trees, hardening the frozen streams and resound- ing in the ear a presageful moan of what the storm-king intends. Cutty is in the parlor with Montzane, and I listen to the improvement her rendering tells. I hear his German tongue pronounce in terms of unctious praise the commendation she has well earned by her assiduity and patience. Precious Cecil! I hear nothing now save the dull sound rolling o'er the earth, shaking the window case- ments, howling through the chimney, laughing at the corners-the voice of the raven-winged storm. I peep from the window. I see my neighbor's cattle standing still with rueful faces and pathetic bellow, calling for repose within the well-filled barn. I see the travelers facing the bleak, icy drops, hieing to their shelter with deploring eye. Ah, the blazing fire, the little children in their mother's arms crowing for the feathery flakes, and weeping tears of artless innocence because they cannot be gratified; the old grandame in the corner (208)   INTUITION.         209 knitting the red Christmas sock; the rosy wife sewing into shirts and drawers the well-bleached cotton. What more needs even he who hath great riches and honor and favor, who courts the coffers filled with that subtle magnet? But hush! Precious Cecil! I hear his voice and feel his breath upon my cheek-and with him comes another. Charlie! Oh, why did I not know him? They two sit down beside me, and the tones of the storm grow dimmer and dimmer. Montzane is playing over Cutty's next lesson, but the music is so far away! There seems wafted across me a breath, fragrant and soft; my respiration is tacit; the body grows still, while the soul calmly is filling itself with celestial aura. I seem to realize fully that the body is no necessary part of the true self. Charlie says, "Anne, it is well with me. 'Death is an arch-way crowned with hidden flowers.' The knell, the shroud, the bier, the tomb and worms, are the fool- ish terrors of the living. Do you remember, dear sister, (and Cecil smiles,) when by his grave, exasperated by my own impotence, I denounced him-this King of all the living? I thought him then a conqueror; but now I know he hath no power save that of proving himself a railway, a coach, anything of transmission-a road, a path, leading to the real birth-place of the soul. Thank Himn whom I daily near, that our spirits are made too big for earth. Oh, Anne! Cecil and I can tell you the setting of life's sun is full of music; but they of your sphere mistake and believe it dawneth at the birth. I s    210        INTUITION. pity those who live and have lived through all their days thus dreading death, and who never look above the fear of dying; enshrouded by that uncertainty which attends even him who has preached heaven and faith; that shudder at the tomb-that shrink to lie and rot, dread to become a soggy clod-and if there be a soul it shall never be certain of a rest, or home. You think of spirit as a formless vapor, a smoke, a steam. I tell you, when your eyes shall be opened, you shall find no perfect thing ever existed in the realm of matter. When you behold the spiritual body you will know what a homely mani- festation of it has been the outward form; you will find how the external effect has mocked the internal cause. When friends die, do not mourn or sigh, or convulse yourselves with anguish, but gaze upon them with con- gratulatory comforting, and know they have but lan- guished into life. You will miss them; aye, for this the lashes must be heavily weighted with tears, and the face tell tales of touching memory; but do not grieve the departed soul; it deters the upward march; through magnetic sympathy the spiritual eye turneth itself and resteth with sadness on the mourner. When you have taught yourselves to hold death in its proper place, then shall all the sorrow of the saints be submerged in joy. We watch for your coming; we note each incident and accident of your lives. Time is less with us than with you. We make ready a home, we plant the vines we loved together there, and sow the seed for flowers like those which blossomed around our earthly doors. ' In my Father's house are many mansions.' Cecil and I are   INTUITION.         2" making ready for you and my Agnes. We can work with glad hearts, for we behold that your earth-life is wise and true. "Tears and groans! We have none to keep us away from our Master's business. Your smiles cheer us, en- courage us. Write to Agnes and tell her I so much like that cross and wreath of inmmortelles, also the unique stone. Tell her I was there with her last Thurs- day, and could but smile at the conversation she held with our precious Gertrude. Give the child her father's love, and tell her to remember my requirement ' not to cry.' She misses me. Cecil holds my hand, and now we must go and work upon our beautiful home, lest it be not ready for you; for we have other duties that can- not be neglected." It was the other voice: "And, mother, mother, darling mother, one kiss." I moved-my eyes were not shut. I gazed around me. The voice had ceased. I held my hands to my ears. What was it? what had it been? Ah! no mir- acle-no! I can tell you. I had seen and heard. I had been in the true normal state-in commerce with the world of spirits. A trance? Not that I know of. I cannot explain. Jesus, on the mount of transfigura- tion, communed with Moses and Elijah. John received, by communication with angels, the Apocalypse. The heavens will open to the pure spirit, and give as we are proper recipients. Mental laws govern: it must be a natural unfoldment of the perceptive powers: denuding ourselves of earthly grossness, forgetting materiality,   212        INTUITION. opening wide the doors of the soul for spiritual influx, is all we need. What! snowing still? Yes, and very hard. I had forgotten -why! what time is it? Ah! here comes my precious adopted. "Cutty-, how long have I been here?" She laughed heartily. "O dear mother! I came up an hour since, when Montzane left, and found you so peaceful-scarcely breatlhing, and you looked so happy! I only peeped in-knew Cecil must be here; has he?" "Yes, Cutty, and Charlie." "Have they!" she exclaimed, clapping her hands- adding, in a moment, "Oh! I shall be so happy when I learn to see mother and father and Johnnie!" "Was I pale, Cutty?" "No, indeed; you was looking towards the window so peacefully and pleasantly!" I kissed the dear child, and that instant I heard a light tap upon the door. "Come!" "Please, ma'am, Lizzie Holt has got home. I thought you'd like to know." "Possible, Jennie! Who told you?" a Their man just come over after milk." "Is she ill?" "No, ma'am, he said not-said she'd been sent home." Cutty, who at first had clapped her hands in her ecstacy of joy, suddenly appeared saddened, and I was in quite a marvel. c; O mother! she has offended some- body. Oh! dear! what will Mrs. Holt do now? Oh!   INTUITION.         213 the blessed child! Will it do for me to go over and call upon her?" "Not quite yet, dear. When did she arrive, Jen- nie?" "Last night, ma'am. A gentleman from the place brought her.' "We were truly mystified, and could not help con- jecturing many possibilities. Cutty passed a restless night. She said, "Lizzie so near, and I cannot see her! it makes me exceedingly nervous." The morning was bright and fair. Traces of the storm were all about us. It had been remarkably severe for a first snow, and in November. Fallen branches lay in the meadow and upon the hills. Tile beautiful but desolated prospect thrilled my soul. I saw Mr. Holt's man out digging paths, and one directly towards our house. We had scarcely finished breakfast, when we heard a great stamping in the basement, and Jennie's voice ex- claiming, "Bless me, Miss Lizzie! how glad I am to see you! and Miss Cutty'll eenmost die, she'll be so joyful."' Cutty was at the bottom of the stairs in a twinkling, and there came up a smothered sound of " much pop- ping." I welcomed the dear child firoml the depths of my heart, and quickly observed she looked very pale; but she said she was quite well, only she was worried because she nmade her mother so much trouble. She added, "Father doesn't say a word; he pities me, I   214        INTUITION. thnk, only he of course doesn't want to quarrel with mother, for lie lores her very muclh." I saw she was oppressed and longed to relieve herself. "You didn't expect to see me home so soon?" "No"I replied; '; but if you have returned in good health, I amn very glad to have you back-or if you have not," I added, hardly knowing how to answer. I must not quiz her, and I hlad cautioned Cutty. Nothing daunted, she said, presently- "I s'pose you thought I'd stay a year?" "Yes," I replied. A moment, then, "What did you think,. Mis Blake, when you knew I had come?" "Oh! I thought you must be sick." "No," she quickly answered, " that wasn't it." "She was cornering me rapidly. Cutty bit her lips. "I was fearful lest the sudden cold weather might have given you a bad cold." - And to lead the conversation another way, I added, "You liked your school very much, your mother told me." 1' I did at first. But I did not like it at all the last three or four months." "' I am really sorry, Lizzie ; for I suppose you are at an age when you require very essential instruction." "They did n't like me very well." "They must be strange people not to like our dear Lizzie." "Well, they did n't like me at all." "Why! that is the most inexplicable thing." "I was sent home."   INTUITION.         215 It was out at last, and she thought I could but ask her why; but I replied, "They hardly appreciated you, dear." "Yes they did-too much. Madame Arguin sent me home."  I was silent, and s-le rose, approaching. Standing directly in front of me, she looked into my eyes and said," Don't you want to know what they sent me home for?" I was caught in the toils. "It could not have been for any misdemeanor, I am sure." "They called it an awful thing," she replied, with her old manner. I moved uneasily, and with an impa- tient gesture she asked, "Don't you want to know what it was all about?" "Lizzie my dear, I do not like to ask you questions, for your mother, I fear, believes you receive wrong im- pressions here. I feel greatly interested in all your joys and sorrows, but must not influence you in religious matters contrary to your mother's desires." ( You never influenced me one bit, Mis Blake, and I told mother so. I knew it all before ever Cutty came here, only I could n't explain the feelings till she told me how-that's it, you see. I don't s'pose, Mis Blake, I ever shall take much comfort in this world, 'cause you see I must speak right out what this in here makes me b'lieve. I told mother I was going to tell you all 'bout it, and I am." The little thing was wounded, and told her story with pathetic intonation. It was what I had expected. She could not curb her young spirit; consequences were banished in the domination of one supreme belief,   216         INTUITION.            !:'? j! t one supreme faith; her innocent heart ached for the  -; sorrowing, and she longed to give comfort by telling the ; marvelous discoveries of inltuition. As the hart pants  for the water-springs, so this instinctive child panted to I give to others the blossoms of precious trust which had grown in her pathway, sown of the Great Reaper. The  / world, so strange to her! she could not understand how  it was each hastened forward in the never-ceasing battle- :1 field of life, caring not whether the brother or sister in Adam rise to heaven or descend to hell.  She had   [ found the philosopher's stone, and yearned to give its  value to the hard, heated, pitiless travelers wearing their years away in fruitless search. She had a child's faith, a womanl's passion, and truly the heroism of a martyr.                        :: "He was so poor and old, Mis Blake, and did nothing but saw wood day after day, and didn't know how to   - read, and every day I learned him a letter; and he had got so he could read cat and dog and man; and then I told him all 'bout God and the angels, and that he wasn't a heathen, (that's what Monsieur Arguin called :: him,) and I carried him roses out of aunt Sarah's con- servatory, to give his sick wife. At first my teachers didn't say anything, but pretty soon Miss Ellenwood  ! called me to her and gave me an awful scolding, and forbid me to teach him any more. I was dreadful rest- less and could n't hardly get my lessons, though I did, [ and I never missed but three times all the while I was there.

It was a real pleasant day, and the teachers let us go into the woods. We were under great trees, and we called them the church, and the brook running be- side us we played was the organ, and the birds were the singers. There was a real cunning little girl with us- Miss Ellenwood's niece; she was eight years old. I told the girls lots of Bible stories, and Effie said such funny things. I was talking 'bout Absalom getting: hung on, the tree by his beautiful long hair, and she said, ' I guess he wished he'd got a wig on, and hadn't got no hair.' Then I told another, 'bout Balaam's ass speaking, and she said,' Jes' like my little doggy Daisy; he speaks, too.' And we talked 'bout the Sabbath day and keeping it holy; she said, 'But 'tis n't wicked to make new bonnets Sunday, 'cause aunty does; 'tisn't wicked if you put all the curtains down so God can't see through.' Miss Ellenwood found it out, you see, and she was awful mad with me. ' Then another day we played I was the minister, and we built a pulpit, and made lots of slips out of branches. Emily Tuffs came from New York, and she goes to a real grand church, and she got mad with me; she said we must all be dressed splendid, and we must have the Grecian bend, and great waterfalls, and lots of curls, and splendid books to carry in our hands; and when we went into church, we must hold our heads up awful proud, and shake our clothes, and mus'nt never have any poor people in there. Little Effie said,' I know it, and we must bow to all the rich folks, and look so to 10'   218        INTUITION. the poor folks we go by on the way to church;' and, Mis Blake, we thought we'd die a laughin' tp see the way she held up her head and turned up her little nose; and she added,' "cause aunty does.' Then we had an awful fuss, for I told 'em I should think they'd be ashamed. It was so wicked it scared me, and I should'nt iz play if we could'nt have some poor people go to church. Finally they said we would have just one poor woman, and she should sit in the back seat. Then we could'nt find anybody to be the poor woman, they all wanted to - be rich; so we had to make one of a stick of wood, and we could well enough, you know, 'cause she did'nt need all the stuffing the rich ones must have; then they never are very fat, you know. I cut the face out with my toilette knife. I made great eyes, and hollow cheeks, and a pinched nose; and after we got it done, Effie said, 'it looked just like aunty, though she was'nt a poor woman, and somebody went and told Miss Ellenwood of that, and she kept getting madder and madder with me.                         ; "Well, when we were all fixed and the people were all seated, I was the minister, and I walked into the pulpit. I preached all the things I could think of to scare the rich people, and to my poor woman I said lots of real good things. I said,' it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven,; then I said right on to the end of it, God loved the poor, and that in heaven there was'nt any back seats in any of the churches; I and when I prayed, I prayed for the poor woman the  ; He :- I   INTUITION.         219 most. I knew all the girls were awfultmad, but I did'nt calre. I would'nt do like other ministers, and if they dil'lnt like me they could turn me away; and I knew  : that would please 'em, 'cause that's fashionable too, if lie don't say just what the people want him to. I did'nt go out shaking hands with all the rich people, but I just took the poor woman and made her walk all the way down the steps with me. Oh! how mad they were, and they went and told Madame Arguin. "I said heaven was full of houses, and trees, and flowers, and that people worked there just as they do here; and that when I died I expected to go visiting with folks and have splendid times; and then I said I did'nt b'lieve Samson ever slew a thousand people with the jawhone of an ass, or that a whale swallowed Jonah, or that the world ever was all drowned, and so many people, and birds, and beasts lived in Noah's ark with only one window; and lots. of other things. Oh! and that I knew a lady who did'nt cry a bit 'cause her son, who she loved so dearly, was dead, 'cause she knew he was learning so much more in heaven than he could here; and that she talked with him every day, and sometimes she heard him answer, (you know who I mean, Mis Blake) " the round eyes twinkled. "Madame Arguin sent for me, and told me she was astonished, and that God would punish me terribly. I told her I was'nt afraid of it. I'd bet He loved me bet- ter than He. did her.

Then he asked me-; "' Do you love God?'                 5 "I said, ' Dearly.' "' Do you try to please Him?' "' 'ery hard,' I said. "' Are your mother and father church members?' "'Yes, I am sorry to say.' "He turned my face up to his, and looked right in my eyes, and I looked right straight in his. I saw Liz- ; zie Holt in them. He said, ' Child, what do you mean  I by such talk?'   INTUITION.         221 "I answered,' 'Cause most all the church members are so wicked.' ," Naughty girl, do you not know they are the regen- erate children of God?' , What's that?' I asked. "'Those who are born anew into the kingdom, who have secured unto themselves an heirship with Christ.' "' I should think they had,' I said. Then I asked him, ' Don't you b'lieve anybody will go to heaven only church members?' "He said, ' Perchalince a few may, who repent so late in life they have no time for baptism and to become members. There are death-bed repentances.' "I told him I did'nt b'lieve in 'em; 'cause they'd go into the next world 'bout the same's they were here, and would have to grow better there. "He looked awful wild at me, and said,' What Spirit- ualist has been talking to you?' "I said, ' None. This in here tells me so; and I should think t'would tell you so, too.' "He staid till I was tired to death, asking me all sorts of questions. I told him I loved God with all my strength, and that God Himself meant love; that I was born again every time I prayed; that I loved the poor, and did'nt b'lieve only just what something in here told me; and I b'lieved that's what good ministers and Christians thought. I hoped they'd all go to heaven, but I was afraid they would'nt; that I was'nt afraid to die when my time came, and that I'd have lots of beau- tiful things in heaven. I did'nt b'lieve people sang any   222        INTUITION.  more there than they did here; that they were happier, though; that they did'nt walk on any sea of glass (who ; wants to?); that theydid'nt swing palm branches no more'n they do here, but that they studied and worked, and slept or rested, and sometimes cried over sinners, and sometimes, when their folks were real good, were  l awful glad; and that they grew better and better every ) day, and bime-by would be good enough to see God. "Then he got up and called Madame Arguin, and I was sent up stairs. Another great long letter went to my mother, and the next thing I knew I was sent home,  'cause I told May Dimple her father (she whispered it to me) was rich, but he was drunk and fell off his   ^ horse and got killed, and the minister and all the people said he would never go to heaven. She cried and cried  lots 'bout it; and I told her, 'I'd bet a million dollars i he was in heaven to-day;' 'cause he was killed when she was only six years old, and now she's most fourteen,  and you see he has had such a long time to be growing better, and she says he was a real good man 'bout every- ' thing else, everybody said so, and he did'nt get drunk only once in a great while. "Now, Mis Blake, who b'lieves God has sent him to  l hell forever ever'n ever? I don't! 'taint natural.  I Well, I told her, and she never heard such a thing be- fore, and she was so tickled she told another girl of it, and it got out among the scholars, and Madame Arguin  i heard of it, and, Oh! how she talked to me, and sent me home; her brother came  clear to Bandley with me. i Do you think I'm an awful naughty girl, Mis Blake?   INTUITION.         223 Don't seem's though I was, but perhaps I am. I feel all right in here." Cutty gave the answer. She clasped Lizzie to her heart, kissing her many times. Indeed, the embrace was so unctious, the little one exclaimed- "O Cutty! you're choking me!" My darling had not forgotten the time when the world was strange and cold, all arid, without track or knowl- edge of that light which had lifted her up to happiness. Once the earth was wide -and dark, because she believed in hopeless graves and everlasting damnation. Now her feet had entered the path to the Promised land, and her whole life had become radiant with expectation. Lizzie remained to dine with us, and in the afternoon Mrs. Holt came over. She appeared very unhappy and sad. When the girls had gone away by themselves into Cuttys chamber, the anxious mother opened her heart to me. I told her Lizzie had repeated the cause of her dismissal with much pathos, and she sighed-the old expression of her perplexity. Then she said- "' Mrs. Blake, what shall I do with her? I am obliged to bear all the chagrin alone, for Mr. Holt never for an instant has reprehended her; he says he feels perfectly willing for her to have her intuitive belief; he dislikes to contravene me, and dislikes very much to check Liz- zie. So there it is-and wlhat is more mortifying, he will meet neither Mr. James or Mr. Blaisdell to talk the affair over." I could not reply conscientiously in a manner pleasing to her, so I kept silence; presently she said--   224     INTUITION.  '"Well, I have no other alternative, I suppose, than to accept matters just as they are. I shall take Lizzie away from Sabbath school, and hire a day teacher into ] the house. If I can procure a good governess, perhaps she might influence, perchance destroy, after awhile,  these dreadful impressions."       a      - Just then the girls made their appearance in search of Cutty's drawing materials, and our conversation be- came suddenly changed. Mrs. Holt and Lizzie took tea with us, and in the evening my darling played her new music, to the de- light of our neighbor. She evidently felt a slight pique, however, that Cutty was so much more advanced than Lizzie, who took the stool, and in her own original way i followed Cutty's classical rendering withl, "Up in the balloon," "The girl of the period," "Dicky's relief," and a medley of a very lively and laughable character. There," said her mother, "that's her style. Any- thing that is simple!"  "Well, it isn't figuratve, mother, that's why I like We could but laugh, but I was sorry for Mrs. Holt. She so little understands her lovely child; she so mis- construes, misinterprets the dear little one. When Cutty and I were alone, she put her arms about my neck and coaxingly said-  "Please, just one question before we retire 'tis not late."                         i "Well, Cuttv. what is it?"   INTUITION.         225 "What about" this evil spirit that governs us? what does demon mean?" '"Demon in the Greek, my dear, is daimon, to know, a god. The learned ancients defined the term generally, ' the spirits of the dead,' a ' spirit, either angel or fiend.' They believed every person to be governed by his or her demon; we read of Socrates' demon, and of Tasso's; of good and of bad demons, who guarded and guided them." "I thought it meant the devil. I used to believe he was a dreadful creature-just exactly like the picture of him in the great Bible." I smiled, and Cutty blushed deeply. "Many older persons than you, my darling, have believed in his Sa- tanic majesty. In this beast, composed of hoofs, wings, horns, and tail. I never accept evil as an absolute force. We are all actors on the great stage of life, capable ofl good and evil; also capable in a greater or less degree of moral obligation." "Is there not a difference between the responsibilities of persons?" "Yes, dear. According to the gift is the amount to be rendered up. ' Unto whom much is given, much will be required.'" "Do you think the spirit of wicked dead people try to govern us?" "Yes, my dear; I do not know why they should not, while we believe the souls of the good strive -o make us happy."   226        INTUITION.             4J ' But why will God permit these wicked spirits to in- jure us?"                        "Out of the Almighty's true philosophy everything  : exists, Cutty. Jesus was tempted. ' It must needs be that offenses come.' Rising above temptation shows    wherein lies the real virtue. Supposing there existed no evil influence, what triumph in being righteous? Evil is an inevitable necessity." "And must always be?"                "I believe so, my child."              .:: "In another state of existence?  "Yes; it ever will be one of the offices of angels to help those around them, and reach down to earth shield- l ing as far as possible those they love."        1 "Does like attract like?" "Yes, child; and we are safe if we will be. Good will not attract evil; here then is the great necessity I of watching ourselves lest we harbor the poison spot  i' which shall gather more and deadly poison to itsblosom. The thorn and the rose grow side by side. We can pluck which we will. All things have their counter in- fluences." "Do you think we are morally weak when evil grasps us so closely?" "Yes, dear; that's why we should be so careful not to place ourselves in an intromittant condition for wick- edness. When we feel the influence coming let us speak to it as Christ did, and bid it go forth." s "But can we always conquer, dear mother? Is not ^)k   INTUITION.         227 the good weak oftentimes, and the evil so much stronger that it overpowers?" "Some, dear, may lack organic balance, and are very sensitive, receptive; for such we should strive--raising them up by kindness and love; but never should allow them for a moment to think they are not fully responsi- ble-that is, if they have reason-for no one suffers from absolute control of bad influence. That spark of the Deity is ever ready to be fanned into a flame if we only will take the bellows and go to work with a will. And angels hands through the shining heavens are held down to grasp our fingers; they fain would lead us up ; and when we turn away, Oh! then my darling, their blessed eyes are full of sorrow's mist." "Oh, mother, mother! if everybody would only re- member this!" Cutty gazed upward when she was speaking, and I saw that beatitude beaming in her eyes which had come of living near heaven. Oh, maylthe good Father spare her to enflower the pathway of humanity with the love which so angelizes her daily life.            ;: i, ,i  '   CHAPTER    XVIII.           I  IT is the last of January. We have had a very quiet season thus far, with the exception of several parties, John B. Gough, Wendell Phillips, and Professor Search.. much in his course of geological lectures. A gorgeous lily, after all its grandeur has been slain by wind and storm, is soon forgotten; so like unto a man of science whose name renowned has brought to his audiences the people of the world to listen to his rhetoric and erudi- tion, but after uttering an offensive fact is the reverse of his first estate. When the Professor had spoken the letter or word pronouncing him a revolutionist against tradition, people wondered at him, and from lip to lip of the church went condemnation, because he had dared to speak the truth. Oh, ignorance! when will ye open your closed doors? when will ye quit conven- tional laws and expedient fallacies, accepting reason's voice and facts which cannot be disputed? The Pro- fessor proved the earth to be millions of years old. Deacon Conway left the lecture room. On the second evening of the course, Mr. Derby, one of the oldest members of the Baptist, rose and demanded of the speaker a controversy. One brought forward facts, sub- stantiated beyond a shadow of contravention; the other twisted and turned Bible passages until the whole audi- (228)   INTUITION.          229 ence were in an uproar of laughter. When the English versions would not suffice for Mr. Derby's argument, he transformed them into Greek, Hebrew, and resurrec- tionized all the commentators from Adam's time to the present; but he failed signally, and the Professor (branded with the name so hideous-"Infidel") strove never so hard to interest his hearers to the end. Mr. Derby left after expressing himself shocked at the man who dared to utter anything not in agreement with Genesis. Mr. and Mrs. Holt attended the entire course; also Cutty and myself. Mr. Holt was delighted; his wife said little, but I have observed she mourns much less over Lizzie's " total depravity." In fact, she has re- cently repeated several speeches of the little one's in- tuitive logic-and that without a sigh. Yesterday I was amazed exceedingly, when Cutty told me Mr. James and Mrs. Holt had disagreed seriously over some theo- logical quibble. And I have learned through Miss Mc- Allister, our dear Lizzie's governess, that her patroness, at times, is really quite disturbed in her mind regarding the subject of election and the elucidation of mysterious doctrine. Her reason is roused I must believe. I have passed very many pleasant evenings with this lady governess. She is practically educated and very greatly accomplished, of prepossessing manners and fine personal appearance; also very gentle in her speech. She has become extravagantly fond of her charge, but avers with smiles, often with hearty laughter, she never found ' the equal." On matters of religion (she has   230        INTUITION,             I been reared beneath the Episcopal faith) she seems to have reflected little beyond the duty of doing as well as she can in this life, leaving the next to uncertainty and hope.' But I assure you, cause has been given her to stir the depths of her lethargy, by Miss Lizzie's queer ques- tions and asservations. I have been very cautious in advancing my kind of information, knowing that silence would best serve the present, and feeling assured all would be well in its own good time. And so the winter passed. Cutty must so soon go! ) I observe she shrinks when she contemplates meeting : those of her own age, although time and circumstance have favored her, giving her self-possession and a pleas- ing nonchalance. She is pronounced by all to be extra- ordinarily beautiful. I realize full well her personal charms, but the soul so eclipses the flesh! She, fre- quently recalls the days of her bleak youth, and sets them in compare with her present; and she declares her whole future shall be, labor, for the sheer sake of truth. She realizes those who work thus, find here no great reward. Instead, they receive disdain, and are stoned even unto the gate of the great Shepherd's fold. And I have seasons of comparing her with the little, despair- ing thing I took from the pauper-house. I never have been in the least mistaken in that first analysis of her character. I thought her idyllic, pathetic, instinctively world-wise. I have not been disappointed- either in the weight and warmth of affection I believed lay within the depths of her soul. If our earth-tarry be long, I anti- cipate the purest enjoyment with her. I think her   INTUITION.         231 boarding-school life will be brief, for she is wonderfully advanced, and learns so readily. Mrs.. Holt prognosti- cates, Cutty will graduate in less than three years from the day of her departure, and return to me a paragon of practical life. The days are now fully occupied--we have so many pleasant talks and so much sewing, for we are making the essential wardrobe ourselves. The dear child is fearful lest she have a single garment that will appear too dressy. I really wish she might be a little more attracted 'by display. She wears everything, however, in the most admirable taste, and has a distinct and natural way for all her acts. Other days have dawned to fade. The long, dreary March has bidden us farewell, and I do not regret it. April, with her smiles and tears, her virgin buds and flushing earth, has passed away, and May is here-that month wherein life flows afresh, and we feel an inward bliss springing up with each rising sun. The air is medicine for the weak; the promise so bounteous creates warm desire for things of Summer. All nature boasts our Father's blessing. The hawthorn whitens like the soul of a just man made perfect; the buds swell and burst to the music of sighing gales. And nearer, nearer draws the day of separation. Mrs. Holt has been over and says Lizzie is complain- ing of a bad head-ache. She wanted to know if I had any sage. Jennie gathered a goodly quantity in the Autumn, so I sent Cutty down to have some put up for our neighbor. I returned with Mrs. Holt, and found the dear little girl lying upon the sofa in her mother's   232        INTUITION.             I chamber, looking really ill. Her eyes were very bright and her cheeks flushed deep red. I advised that a phy- sician be called immediately, for a terrible apprehension of typhoid swept through my soul. I kissed the precious child, and asked her if she felt very sick. She whis- j pered,        - "Please don't tell mother, she will feel so bad; but it seems as though I should go pretty soon. I have been thinking 'bout it all the while. Do you think Dr. Wil- kinson will tell me if it is so, Mis Blake?" "Do you feel alarmed, Lizzie? You do not want to die." "Oh!" she smiled radiantly and lifted her head from the pillow, "that is'nt it; only I have so much to do if I am going. Afraid, Mis Blake, afraid, Oh, no! what have I to fear? Lots of angels are right at the gate waiting for me. I really believe Cutty's father and mother and Johnny are there, and your brother Charles, and my aunt and cousin; and who do you think I be- lieve will get hold of my hand quickest if I go?" A thrill fled swiftly through my frame. Would she see him first? grasp his hand ere I be permitted? I was impatient for a half moment. "Cecil," I whis- pered. She bowed her round head assentingly, and smiled. Mrs. Holt was just coming in with sage tea, mustard for draughts, and said she had sent for the doctor, but should not delay another moment in employing some means to relieve the dear sufferer. So we went imme-   INTUITION*         233 diately to work, and near tea-time Lizzie fell asleep. Her mother told me with tearful eyes the following story. i Day before yesterday, Mrs. Blake, Lizzie asked my permission to take a walk with Belle Orcut. At first I refused; then her piteous appeal touched my heart and I complied with her request, asking her where they were going. ' Oh, down by the mill-brook in search of wild flowers,' she replied. When she had been absent nearly an hour and a half, I commenced to feel uneasy. The stream you know is swollen considerably with the spring rains. I imagined all sorts of possible acci- dents, and at last became so nervous, I went in search of her. And now, Mrs. Blake, you will pardon my weakness, if thus it be, if I tell you how my Lizzie ap- peared to me there, and what she was saying." "Sweet little one!"I murmured, and with a slightly flushed face Mrs. Holt said, "It was where the water rippled, losing itself among the mosses down by the old mill, under the trees where the sun-light fell through their young leaves and upon her flaxen hair, making it so beautiful, Mrs. Blake. The birds, fearless of her presence, fairly sang near her feet. Belle stood over her, twining anemones and vio- lets in the short curls, and I never saw Belle look half as well. She had her chestnut hair coiled up neatly, her tall, yielding form clad in modest print, her eyes bor- rowed a warmth and light from  their conversation. Lizzie's lap was filled with emerald mosses, from some of which, she was fashioning a chalice to hold her wild blossoms.. They did not observe my approach. I con-   234        INTUITION. fess I went stealthily, for I wanted to hear what it could be that so transformed Belle. My darling was too deeply engaged to .gaze upward, and I stepped, while both heads were bent in adoration over a scarlet lichen, close behind a projecting rock, so near I could hear their conversation. I was subtly beguiled, I assure you, Mrs. Blake. I heard Belle say, "' And really, truly, Lizzie, do you believe He is no respecter of persons?' "' Truly, Belle, truly. He loves you even better for all your heart-aches. When He sees people who profess to be so awful good treat you so, He pities you and wants to put His arms around you and keep you close to Hiti.' "' But I never can join the church and love Christians.' " Oh, they are not all alike, Belle. There are good, real good christians and ministers-real good.' "' But, Lizzie, I remember that Sunday so well. Oh, if yoil had only been there! Miss Cutty is splendid, but after all, she isn't you.' "Lizzie seemed very thoughtful for a moment, then lifting her eyes, id, ' Don't you care 'bout 'em, Isabel; you jest do the ery best you can-I'll risk the rest- and you have got one advantage, Belle.'   / "' What is it, Lizzie?' "'You'll feel natural in heaven. You haven't got anything to lose, but everything to find. You wont miss splendid dresses, or lots of 'false hair, or great houses; you'll have a better home than ever you had here. I dare say somebody has got you ready a splendid place.   INTUITION.         235 I've wondered lots and lots of times what Miss Duane would do without her poodle.' Belle smiled, and Lizzie added, 'I shall look very sharp among the doves when I go to heaven to find Lily. But at any rate, Belle, you jest keep real good, love everybody much's you can whlo treats you so, and God will jest as sure fix it all right. I'll bet the day'll come up there when these very people who won't speak to you here will try ever so hard to get introduced to you.' "' You don't, Lizzie!' "'Yes, I do ; 'cause God and the angels are going to fill all the tired hearts full of joy. You jest learn all you can here, Belle, and you'll do splendid things there.' "' Oh, Lizzie! do you really think so? Do you think I might learn to sing there?' "'Of course, Belle--and paint like Cutty, and talk French, and-Oh, Belle! I expect God's got such beautiful things for people who have suffered here. Oh, I expect to see such splendid, splendid things!' "Anything like the things here, Lizzie?' '"Oh, yes; only so very much more beautiful.' "And that great girl, Mrs. Blake, looked upon Lizzie as tlhough she was a perfect goddess of inspiration and apocalypse. She asked, "' Do you think I'll get rid of this dreadful sticking to me of the past, when I was so bad?' ' Yes indeed, Belle. It will be so awful long ago, and you will have been good so long, God will have it all forgotten.'   236        INTUITION.             .  With tears streaming down her face like summer rain, Belle kissed the hands caressing her, saying in ! husky tones, "' I will remember these things all the while, and as you say, there are good Christians and good church- members, and maybe I'll find them sometime. I guess I shall, where the church isn't so grand, and perhaps \ them who slight and scoff me here, will seek me there, if I am one of Christ's children. O Lizzie! if I ever do go to heaven it will be because God made you.' "Utterly regardless of the passage of time, and ob- livious to everything around them, they held longer converse. I remembered, Mrs. Blake, all He has said of His little ones." Mrs. Holt was gazing very thoughtfully down upon the roses and lilies threaded in the carpet. I merely said in a sort of quiet response, "I would much like to have heard this conversation." I offered neither ap- proval or comment, believing a great change had dawned in the mother's soul, whose ultimate would assure me, "A little child had sown good seed." Mrs. Holt appeared greatly perturbed concerning Lizzie; her usually fair forehead wore a scowl of deep solici- tude, while she bent herself down, listening to her daughter's breathing; raising her head, she imprinted a lingering kiss upon the little flaxen curls, murmuring, "My precious child." Did I observe a trifle of regret in that caress? I thought I did. Cutty, impatient at my prolonged tarrv, came over and escorted me home. In the evening she sat beside A'   INTUITION.         237 me, and for awhile we were silent. I watched her in her meditative mood, until impulse caused me to put up my hands, and sweep back from her forehead the masses of her bright, burnished hair. "Let me dream with you, dear." She smiled, displaying her white teeth. "Yes, mother, darling mother, dream with me. I was thinking of Liz- zie. If she dies, it seems to me like a poor hunted bird finding its haven of shelter." Then we had a pleasant season of rehearsing our part connected with the little one, and before retiring I answered Cutty one question. "Call I progress as rapidly as I desire?" "What is the meaning of the word, Cutty?" "I think, dear mother, it is the drawing forth of that embryonic germ which lies within us all; for as we educe from the soul the true life, and become actually conscious of its'power, if we will, we may raise it above the sensuousness of earth, and by careful training of the God-like quality, rise so high as to be freed from selfish instincts, and almost walk with angels. We may employ -reason until we shall have escaped its bounds, and intuition will show us the mysteries of un- utterable things." "Yes, Cutty, do not forget your own explanation. Practise it, and it will suffice. And now, darling, a kiss, for the clock is striking ten." 7.           CHAPTER XIX. I AM really quite uncomfortable. I have striven at a dozen different occupations to entertain me, and failed. Jennie does not help me in the slightest, for she sighs ever and allon, " O laws! how lonesome the house is without Miss Cutty!" The week bounding my darling adopted's absence has seemed a month. I have read and re-read her four let- ters with a lover's avidity. She wrote she was pleas- antly situated, liked her chum, and her only sorrow was, fear, lest I become sad through loneliness, and deep so- licitude for Lizzie Holt. In her first letter she wrote-  "I never shall forget my parting with that sweet child. I could think of nothing save an angel pluming its wings for a long flight. Mother, I am rejoiced to hear she is better, but something tells me she never will get well. If she fails rapidly, and you are apprehensive of death, please send for me." And Cutty may be right. Lizzie recovered from her attack of fever. sufficiently to ride out, and has spent the day with me once since Cutty left. But she looks so very pale, and wastes away, and gains no strength, and is so passive, though her mother and father thinks (238)   INTUITION.         239 she will. oon be herself again. Mrs. Holt has grown really old in appearance during her daughter's illness. I think she has suffered much through fear, and am positive, regret has something to do with it. Miss McAllister, who has been at her home in Mary- land, upon a visit, returned yesterday. I was in Lizzie's chamber when the lady came up, and I quickly detected the change from happy congratulation to surprise upon her countenance when she saw her pupil. June, with her wealth of roses and singing birds, has come. I have been engaged in gardening for the past week. Cutty's last years verbenas and heliotropes are in full blossom; their perfume freshens memory and causes me to caress their petals and leaves for his sake -my angel boy! he loved them. Lizzie fails; she is still the passive, patient little thing she has been from the first. Mr. Holt purchased, a few weeks since, a magnificent little pony and phaeton for her to take her airings in. Her mother drives around town every pleasant day, and rather against her inclina- tions halts opposite Suky Black's, Hiram Orcut's, and several other humble tenements in the village. Baskets of provision and bundles of clothing are handed out, and voices say, "God bless you, Miss Lizzie." Tears fall from old and faded eyes, for they are not blind to the truth. "Passing away." Belle has gone to Lowell to work in one of the facto- ries. Heaven keep her! Lizzie has tried several times to converse with her mother regarding her going away, she never speaks of Death, but Mrs. Holt will .not listen,   240        INTUITION. she instantly goes into hysterics and exclaims, "Lizzie you will not die, you must get well." Ah, I have seen the little mouth quiver and the small, pale hands trem- ble. She finds happiness with her father though, and comes to me nestling down in my bosom like a wounded dove. Yesterday, I crowned her fair hair with June roses. She was the perfect photograph of one of An- gelo's Madonnas. When they had faded, she untwined them, touching them with her soft fingers, mournfully. "They are wilting, to become dust again, ML Blake." I said, "Yes, Lizzie." "But there will come from the dust beautiful flowers next year-Cutty told me." She smiled sweetly. "Isn't she coming pretty soon, Mis Blake?" "Yes, dear, I will send for her in a few days." "I would love to kiss her once--just once before-" she paused an instant or two, then drew me towards her and whispered, "I must get her messages for her mother and father and Johnny you know. I have got lots and lots now, for I have asked -all my friends who have got angels what I shall tell them." "Can you remember them all, Lizzie?" "Oh, yes, Mis Blake, and I will take yours just before I go, you know; do n't feel bad 'cause I shall see him first, Mis Blake." She saw a tear weighting my lashes. "Do you think I shall go soon? I wish you would only ask the doctor and tell me. He will not answer me. Oh, do, Mis Blake! cause you see we ought to know somewhere near, so's to send for Cutty; will you, Mis Blake?"   INTUITION.         241 There came a radiant glow of. expectancy in the child's eyes, which lasted for minutes. I could not re- fuse and I dare not promise. I kissed her. But I did ask Doctor Wilkinson that evening. He walked from Mrs. Holt's to my own door with me. He said, "Mrs. Blake, she is dying of quick consumption. She cannot live a week, I think. Sitting down yesterday with Mrs. Holt, I thought to inform her, but I could not do it. The first syllable I uttered she commenced to weep." I was not surprised, and when I had bidden the doctor "good-night," I went to my chamber and wrote to Cutty to get leave of absence for ten days or a fort- night; to bring her books and she should not lose her lessons. I dispatched the letter by the first mail, and anticipated my darling on the day after the morrow. A few days since, Jennie asked me if I was quite willing, ", on her own account," she might make Miss Lizzie something nice. I gladly acquiesced, and straight- way I heard much beating of fresh eggs. In the after- noon she came to my  chamber door all dressed in span clean gingham, with a bran new bandana turbaning her jetty frizzes, and the whole six of her gold rings upon six fingers. She had something covered nicely with a napkin white as the '" driven snow." "Please, Mrs. Blake, do you think I might see Miss Lizzie for a few minutes and carry her this, being that you are willin', ma'am?" I gave the permission, believing the little one would "   242        INTUITION.              J be glad to see Jennie, for she had inquired several times for her. "Please look, ma'am."                I I saw some very nice wine jelly moulded in the form of flowers and leaves, and several cream custards. In half an hour after Jennie had left me, I saw her return- ing with her handkerchief in her hand. "Who can    l weep in such a sick chamber as that one? ' I thoughlt. A tap upon the door. "Come." "Oh! ma'am, never sence I'se born did I hear or see the like. Oh! she'll surely die. She talks so, she made me cry, and I could not stay a bit longer. Oh! ma'am, hear what she said." "' Was her mother present, Jennie?" "No, please, she said while I sat with Tizzie she'd go and do some little things she wanted to. The first thing the child done, Mrs. Blake, was to take hold my hand and squeeze it. I felt so sorry for her I thought I'd say something to cheer her up, and I said- "' Miss Lizzie, you look better; you'll git well in a few days, I think.' "She looked so disapinted, and said, ' No, Jennie; do I?' She was tlinkin' a minit, then she said, ' Jen- nie, I'm going to a beautiful place; have you got any- body in heaven?' "She seat me so, I could'nt hardly speak, but I said quick as I could,' My old man was a good Christian; he used to shout in meetin' so you could hear him half   INTUITION.         243 a mile; but I don't suppose he's gone to the same place with white folks.' "' What's- his name?' she asked. "Simon Peters,' I told her; then she said- "'How old was he when he went away?' "I told her, and she asked me had I got a photograph of him. I laughed till I thought I'd die, and she laughed, too. Then she said over and over again, ' Si- mon Peters, Simon Peters. I mus'nt get it mixed up with Simon Peter, you know, Jennie, for if I should I might get quite mortified, you know; but I'll find him, Jennie, and tell hilm just what you want mne to.' Then I cried. I choked, and swallowed, and winked, and coughed, but I could'nt help it. Then she said- "' Jennie, what are you crying for? perhaps God will let you go pretty soon. We can't all go at once, you know. '"Only think, Mrs. Blake, she thinks its sich a blessin' 'cause she's going to die." "To die, Jennie?  Lizzie is about to enter the only true Life." She did not quite comprehend me, and went on to tell how intolerant Mrs. Holt was, because she shed tears in Lizzie's presence. "I did'nt dare tell her a word that had been said, Mrs. Blake." "No, Jennie; it is a forbidden subject with the poor deluded woman.   Heaven help her, for it is coming." Cutty has arrived. She looks fresh and fair as a new   244        INTUITION. blown rose. She stands in painful contrast to our dear Lizzie. Though she has been absent so brief a season, I find she has had the simplicity of her nature shocked numerous times. In fact, the world and its people are a marvel to her; she gives them, however, that same unswerving, unchilled love which has so ennobled her    youth and kept her in gentle patience with mankind. I have felt greatly amused at her questions. "Do children usually govern their parents?" she asked. 1' They ought not to," I replied, " unless the parent be idiotic, insane, or so far partaking of the non eompos as to prove inefficient in the proper sphere." ") Do people ever teach their daughters housekeeping now-a-days, ever teach them to sew or mend?" "They fail in this respect, Cutty, I believe, in these latter days. Why, dear?" "Mother, when one young lady recommends herself to another, she says, ' Why, I never went into the kitchen in my life. I never saw a loaf of bread even rising, and I did'nt know beef steak was part of a cow or ox until a day or so before I left home. I was asking mother what part of a hog beef steak was, and she said, "Dear me! I never heard; let's ask pa." And pa said it did not belong at all to a hog."' "Cutty, dear, you are making the world's children ridiculous." I said this, and she looked very earnest, declaring in gentle emphasis it was really so; " and when they write home to their mothers," she added, " they say, I want   INTUITION..         245 such and such things immediately, Madame; or to their father, Monsieur; and in matters of religion-0 mother!" She was silent for a half-moment, with the strangest I expression upon her beautiful face. "Is it the world's religion and worship of God I have seen?  "What like, my darling?" "There are only five exceptions, my dear mother, in a school of eighty-seven scholars. I wonder how they sit so proud and cold opposite that crucifix hung aloft, with that sad, passionless face, that thorn-crowned head those limbs racked in martyrdom and stained with the blood of skepticism. O mother, I cannot help watch- ing their faces to behold whether or no they appreciate the lovely being who was spit upon for truth's sake, whether in their hearts they hold the echo of his cry, 'Father, forgive them.' I only realize the presence of spiritual things when I hear them disputing the matter of creeds and sects." "What sect does your Principal belong to, Cutty?" "I do not know; she takes us with her Sundays to the Rev. Freeman Loveland's church, Orthodox.  Miss Battles told me  she believed Madame  Royale was a Baptist-or had been-had some trouble concerning her ideas of the Eucharist, and never has spoken to many of the church since." "When will the kingdom of God become progressive enough on earth to be as it is in heaven?  when, my dear Cutty, will all those finer impulses be stirred, those of kindness, forgiveness, love, justice, right? when will   246        INTUITION. there be resurrectionized that beatitude of the inner consciousness which shall give utterance to desire for true brotherhood?" "Never, nlother, never, until the thousand different dogmas of sect become extant through knowledge and grace; never, until reason usurps the place of prejudice; never, until faith shows her works; never, until people submit themselves to the waves of progression and allow. washings and tumblings in' the sea of philosophy; study, investigation, throwing aside educational fixtures, listening to intuition; and at last they would sweep in on some high billow and leap upon the shore, there to write their thoughts and assurances on the sands of Eternity."                   / I was pleased with my darling's reply. Every hour gives me assurances of her improvement and study. She asked me another question while we were making a bouquet to carry-to Lizzie. "Do mothers of this age write only of dress and style?" "Why, my child?" "I was present in Miss Clara Granly's room, with several other young ladies, when she received a letter from home. She read portions of it to us, and the bur- den of the sheet appeared to be a description of a dress the mother wore at a party somewhere; what people said and did there, how Mrs. and Miss so-and-so were dressed, the new style of arranging the hair, the remark- able stylish gait of Mrs. something, a French lady--here I am gossiping, mother; but the ways of the world are   INTUITION.         247 so strange! Is this common? Do many mothers do this I wonder? I was thinking thus when the other young ladies ran out and got letters they had received; and for the edification of Miss Granly, they read what their mothers had written. Much the same. But all are niot like them, for I have a precious- "The pero- ration came in the form of an embrace and a very sweet kiss. "I will not retail gossip any more; only I was in such a wonder." "No, dear; there are fresh spots in the desert-good, true mothers, who are practically wise. Would to heaven there were more!" Our bouquet was complete. Roses, pinks, heliotrope, white violets, mignonnette, jessamine, tube and musk roses, verbenas, forget-me-nots, geraniums, and in the centre a full, fair japonica." It was Lizzie's first meeting with Cutty, since her re- turn; and it was refreshing to be present. No repining over sickness, no long tales of terrible suffering and sleepless nights, no long faces and significant glances. lizzie was very comfortable, and they laughed and talked joyously; the little olie inquiring after all board- ing-school concomitants, and the pupils, and Cutty's chum, and at last in a way that convulsed us all with merriment, she said, "Is there anything figurative there, Cutty?'" Mrs. Holt very astutely called me from the apartment, so the dear girls might have a little love-feast all to themselves.                    () "My darling is very much better; and I am so re-   248        INTUITION. joiced. I never have been hopeless, although I think Dr. Wilkinson would have made me so if he could. Htave you ever thought, Mrs. Blake, she would die?" "I replied slowly, "Mrs. Holt, you pain me. I think our little girl is not yet free from imminent danger." "Why, my dear lady! danger!" and the mother's merry laugh sank down into my heart like a weight of lead, " she has been free from danger these five weeks; what do you think is the matter with her?" I hardly knew my duty. I waited a half moment, then answered, "My dear friend, I think Lizzie is in a decline." I thought my hesitancy in answering rather disturbed Mrs. Holt, but when I had spoken, she said, "Oh, no! She is greatly debilitated from fever, and it takes so long for one to get re-established, you know. Her cough is only the effect of an inflamed throat." "What has Dr. Wilkinson said of her recently?" "He only comes twice a week, and he calls her com- fortable." I changed the subject, for I trembled for that hour which so surely must dawn. I sat awhile longer, and upon Cutty's rejoining me, we took our leave. When we were home again, my darling adopted told me of her delightful interview with Lizzie. "She was not saddened an instant through it all, ex- cept when she told me her mother wouldn't believe she was going away. It was so pitiful to hear her; she told me how many times she had tried to talk with her mother   INTUITION. .        249 and could not. But her father, she loves him very much; she tells him, and he said to her, "'( Yes, my little daughter will soon be where she will have many opportunities to take all the poor children to Sabbath school she desires to; and where she can indulge her intuitive belief I trust.' "She wanted me to promise when she had gone I would stay a day or two with her family and comfort them. She says, 'They'll b'lieve our doctrine then, Cutty; I'll bet they will.'" "So like her, my dear. I wonder if she will use that expression there?" We both laughed, and neither could explain the sensation the thought caused in our hearts-and then we were very quiet a long time, thinking. Jennie interrupted our monologues by ringing the tea- bell, and we went down clasping our arms around one another like two girls. My adopted daughter is as tall as I am, and I am medium height. Tea over, we went into the parlor. Cutty played and sang to me, then read several extracts from recent compositions.  I was pleased with the high evidence of her talent for ideality, and for the thousandth time or more, I thanked heaven that I ever went to the pauper- house. (, "*   CHtAPTER   XX. IT was a lovely sunset. The west was filled with rainbow colors, and the departing sun lent his rays to paint the tree-tops with that soft shade which seems to temper the hearts of all who gaze thereon. Mr. Holt's man came suddenly-around the corner of the house, breathless and quivering; pale as marble, he said, "Please, they want you quick, ma'am." I gave Cutty one glance, and speechless we hastened to obey. Entering the hall we heard Mrs. Holt weeping violently and her husband striving to soothe her. Upon seeing me she rushed into my arms, straining me to her bosom in convulsive agony, and said, in a voice I never shall forget, "O my Father in heaven, she is dying." I answered, caressing the poor woman's hair, "No, no, she is just commencing Life. Oh, Mrs. Holt, you will l not distress her last hours or moments; do, I implore, be calm, and see what a beautiful passing away it will be. So soon an angel! Your precious little girl safe in such loving arms. Promise me, you will not embit- ter her journey." She dropped to her knees, rocked back and forth, wrung her hands, pulled at her hair, and gazing upward (250)    INTUITION.         251 with eyes almost protruding in their agony she hoarsely whispered, " O God! help, help, lielp!" Lizzie had asked to see Mr. Blaisdell, Mr. James, and Miss Duane. They had been sent for, and directly made their appearance. I placed my arm around Mrs. Holt's waist and soothingly said, "Now, strength, dear lady, we are going to see an angel go to, heaven-that's all-where she will be so safe-so safe, and only a little while and you will see her again. Come now, do not, O do not cause her to go in sorrow." Bent almost to breaking, I led her in. "Mis Blake, I'mn so glad-mother, dear mother- Cutty-don't cry any more, dear, darling mother." Mrs. Holt shook like a forest tree battling a monster wind; her teeth chattered in their sockets, she clung to my hand with a grip so fierce it was painful. I whispered, "Courage-remember," and we sat down side by side near the head of the couch. Lizzie mo- tioned for the minister. "Pray, Mr. Blaisdell, for mother, father, all of 'em, and forgive Lizzie Holt for any naughty thing she ever said." The man of God, with trembling voice, offered a brief petition. Then she called Mr. James, and of him also asked pardon, saying in the sweetest voice- '"Oh! please teach little children ' God is love."' She kissed Miss Duane, and whispered smilingly, '"I was naughty-very naughty-when I frightened you that night. I am sorry. Will you forgive me?" Sallie looked a little chagrined, but answered, "Yes,   252        INTUITION, Lizzie, I will." She glanced at Mr. James and took her seat. "' Lift the curtain, Cutty, please-'tis so beautiful to journey by the setting sun--and when I get up a little , higher it will be brighter. I thought all day I should be called to-night." Mrs. Holt sobbed aloud. ' Mother, dear mother, you are doing splendidly, don't cry now." The loving, aching heart held hard its strings lest  1 they snap in their dreadful tension. It was true hero- ism.  Lizzie asked her father to move her a little. "A lit- tie higher, dear papa. Mis Blake, I have got all my messages-every one-and I shall surely tell Cecil-and I have got yours, Cutty-and-mother, please take hold of Lizzie's hand--here, papa-here's the other-come, Miss McAllister and Mis Blake, where I can see you better-and here, Cutty-right here-kiss me, mother-, papa--Oh! the beautiful hills-it is a long way over there--I cannot go alone-Oh! smell the violets, Cutty -it is growing dark-and the hills are so high." Mrs. Holt kept whispering while she gazed at the ceiling, herself white as a statue, u O God, help her!" The little one was quiet for a moment, then she mur- mured, "I am so tired-so tired-and it is so dark." "Are you afraid, Lizzie?"I whispered near her waxen ear. "Oh! it's getting lighter, Mis Blake-the figurative  is all going away-Oh! somebody with a lace dress and   INTUITION.   .      258 --beautiful hair-smell the roses, Cutty-he's coming --he's holding his staff hard, 'cause he's so tired." "Who, Lizzie?" "The old man I taught cat-and dog-and he's com- ing-Aunt Sarah told him I was sick." The soft evening breeze lifted the lace draperies and refreshed the breath of the journeying little one. "Mother, kiss your Lizzie-and papa-" The liquid brilliance of her gaze met ours in the last flickering sun rays. The mother drew her daughter close to her bosom, and their lips met. "O my child-my darling, I have lost the whole world! Oh! how can I live!" "It is weary-for you-for a little while, mother- dear mother-but so bright for me. You do not want -to keep me. He crowns us, but smites you." I saw Mrs. Holt raise her hands to her head. I feared lest she disturb the heavenly hour, and I whispered in her ear, "O do not commit an act you -will regret! Courage, remember." "Help, Father!" was her response. At that moment, Lizzie's eyes dilated and gleamed soft in their parting glances; her voice sank, her head drooped to one side, her words were slightly inarticulate, yet we heard them all. "His kiss, quick-Mis Blake -l-e's come-his white hands are stretched out for me -0 Cecil-he points upward towards the beautiful- beautiful hill top-Oh! the violets-Cutty's kiss, quick --tis true-Oh I 'tis true, mother-for I see them-her father and mother-and Johnnie-"   254        INTUITION. My darling adopted clasped her hands, and murmured, raising her tearless eyes, filled with a lovely smile, towards the western heavens, as though there they waited, " 0O welcome the little stranger! mother, clasp her to your arms." "She does, Cutty--she does-they are leading me- good-night-good-night all-the sun is not setting there --I've got all the messages-they are smiling, for they hear me-good-night, mother- father-Mis Blake- Cutty-and all-good-night. Oh! smell the roses- hold me tight, Cecil-Oh! how beautiful--" The blue eyes had slowly closed themselves-the smile lingered -the last sun ray glorified her face-and precious Liz- zie Holt had joined the angels. Mr. Blaisdell sat with bowed head, Mr. James and Mr. Holt bore the fainting mother away, Miss Sallie was weeping, Cutty laid her face close to the marble brow, and smilingly said, " O, is'nt it blessed to die!" The night had shut down with her new moon and the ' angel's forget-me-notsi" the house was still, the ser- vants passed through the halls with noiseless footsteps, the-white crape fluttered at the door knob, for Lizzie had asked me not to allow any signs of mourning in or about the mansion-and I treasured all her desires re- garding the funeral and her mother's wardrobe. Cutty and I remained all night with Mrs. Holt; we had sev- eral letters to write and telegrams to dictate. We had robed our little Lizzie's form and laid it to rest in the parlodi on one of the sofas. It was a beautiful form, I assure you. Smiling, straight, the flaxen hair wreath-   INTUITION.         255 ed in the flowers we had brought her in the day, the waxen fingers held roses and white violets to the nos- trils, as though she still scented those heavenly blossoms, the tiny feet were encased in white slippers-Oh! those dear patterings-! how they came back to me as I gazed upon her when our work was finished.    CHAPTER     XXI.           I A PLACE was made in the funeral procession for Suky Black, Belle Orcut, who had been sent for, and many of the village poor. Very noticeable in the fifth car- riage was an infirm old man; he carried a staff, and his white hair blew in long, thin tresses, out to the summer wind. He, whom her spiritual eyes had seen journey- ing over the road, had arrived, and was permitted to lay beside her smiling face, wild blossoms he had picked on his way. Aunt Sarah had indeed told him Lizzie Holt was sick, and he had no power of will to resist his desire to see his little teacher. The village had something for gossip. Mrs. Holt dressed in pure white, because her happy child had requested it. Lizzie said to me a few days previous to her death, "Mis Blake, it is the beautiful Summer-time, and I am going to the beautiful Summer land, and I want mother to wear white at the funeral and all the time till cold weather. She mus'nt put on black because God has been so good as to make me an angel." "Mr. Blaisdell spoke well at the grave. He came to see me the afternoon preceding the obsequies, and asked me a few questions. I answered without delay, then asked him a few. One of which was-           ; (256)      b   INTUITION.    .       257 "Do you think Lizzie Holt has gone to heaven?" He rubbed his forehead, hemmed, drew    on his glove, and answered- "Yes, I have not a doubt of it." Mr. James walked at the head of the Sabbath school, in the funeral procession, and Miss Sallie's class sang at the grave- "I shall know her there! I shall know her there, By the shining folds of her wavy hair; By her faultless form with its airy grace That an angel's pen might fail to trace-- By the holy smile her lips will wear, When we meet above I shall know her there. I shall know her there, and her calm blue eyes Will look in mine with glad surprise, When my bark, wild-tost o'er life's rough main, The far-off port of heaven shall gain; Though an angel's robe and a crown she wear, 'By the song she sings I shall know her there." Each one of the class laid a white rose-bud upon the casket as they looked their last of Lizzie's earth form, and I could but bear in mind the smiling face of the angel child watching to behold if her desires had been well regarded. I believe she was pleased. A year has passed by. Another summer is blossom- ing around us. Another June's roses deck dear Liz- zie's grave. It is a cheerful spot. No cypress or wil- low, no mourning statue in marble, but instead, gay blossoms, a plain, pure cross, inscribed with her precious   258        INTUITION. name, a rustic seat, w emr sits often a woman greatly changed from her foinm estate. She is meek, good to Lizzie's poor, has forgotten total depravity and election, has little fear of making heaven a material place, re- calls a life perfumed of angel's watches, and from mem- Ad ory selects her example. There are Heights and Depths. Good and Evil. Joy and Sorrow. Reason has taught      j her to shun the one and reach upward to God, and out- ward to do His will, " loving our neighbor as ourselves." She mourns not Lizzie's absence, for she has taught her- self to live near her, and regards "Death as an archway crowned with hidden flowers." Cutty is still at Madame Royale's, progressing rapidly in her studies, and I live on with Cecil never very far away. "A drowsiness is stealing over me Which is not sleep; for though I close mine eyes, I am awake and in another world."--LONGFELLOW.
