The sun has just been swallowed up in a mist, and a-lurid light is abroad over the land and over the waters. Smoke from a thousand chimneys of kitchens, of workshops, of steamboats, of every thing that groans for the necessity or the luxury of men-a dark incense from the forge-altars of tolling hu- manity to God supplies partially the clouds which hang like gloomy drop-curtains above the forthcoming drama of night, and shadow the prelude of queer antics this same glim- mer of light is performing among the alleys and dens of the large city. It shines in through parlor-windows on the bright, clean children of wealth, and puts a happy glow on the pale cheek of poverty and want; it is lost in the gleam of pleasant firesides, and trembles, a ghastly mockery, on emberless hearths; it mingles with the hundred ves- per-flames that light the inspiring ritual of the Catholic faith, add bubbles up with the poison in the deat4-dlhalices of as many grog- shops. Ubiquitous as Queen Mab, it pene- trates nearly everywhere, dances for a mo- ment, and goes ou--lcaving in the gloom of this dirty street a strange -moving tling, a man, whom we follow. He is dressed in coarse sailor's garb,' and   a heavy fur cap squelched on his head leaves visible little more than a wilderness of wiry] hair and weather-stained whiskers, from which, as from a jungle, peer out the lions- his eyes. This lion-hiding jungle is evidently on the outlook for hunters. It turns its matted head this wayand that way, stops sometimes to look closely around, and goes on again. It conceals something more than lions- the lions' prey, a lamb; for, look closely! short, thin tresses mingle with the jungle-  growth, and a small head rests on the filthy shoulder with innocent trustfulness. The common dirt which discolors the dresses of these two can not hide the difference in their quality and texture. As the fair. faco with the rough neck it touches, the rude sea- man's jacket contrasts strangely with the fine swaddling of the infant!  Occasionally, asrho walks, the 'man gazes into the blue eyes, and smiles. The child, all unknowing the bitterness of those smiles, beats the crisp hairs with its chubby fists, crowing in infant glee. The manner of the man is noticeable to the most carcless orotho most anxiously hurrying passer. IIis brawny arms almost cover his burden and conceal its charactcer, yet he is jealous of tho small   portion still unhidden. - As if some one strove to deprive him of it, ever as ble walks he clasps it more closely to his breast, whereat the yearling's joy is smothered in the gaping pocket of the seaman. . "Laugh now, little one, because you don't know! But you shall know, you shall know some time! -She shall not,shall she?" l A scowl passed like a cloud-shadow over all. of the face that thne jungle left uncon- cealed. The vine-like hair of the child, stirred by a puf of night-wind, wrapped its tendrils about the black wire, and the aim- less but meaningful beatings of the chilcld- ish hands went on more vigorously than be- fore l The man seemed to accept these gestures as an acquiescence on the chiltd's part, and, as it were, the lamb having thus agreed to be devoured, the lion became less ravenous to devour. -Whatever it was that the infant should know, and that visionary she should not know, the idea iwrouglit a change in th heart and gait of the jungle-man. For now, as the night dropped around him, he saun- tered very slowly and hummed a sailor's song in low, sad strains. Duritg this the lions forbore to gnash their teeth and ceased all their ferocity, so soft were for a moment the eyes peering out from the tangled mass of hair and whisker. Then it becamne too dark to skc the lions at all, and it was barely possible to follow the shadowy motions of the man as he walked - a little farther and turned into a cellar, Which opened a reeking valve for many bad odors to the street. No sooner had he disappeared than the rain, which seemed to have spared him until then for the sake of his lovely burden, came down in scattering, large drops, and, quickly thick- ening, fell in heavy masses. Descending half a dozen brick steps, he entered a sub- terranean apartment, which appeared at first to be tenantless. But he was soon made aware of the presence of some one by a shrill voice, which came from the chaos of' a low truckle-bed in one corner, inquiring: "What der ye want? what der yer want? What've ye there, Jem? a strainge gintle- man? And why don't ye have yeself an- nounced?"   The jungle, having seen no knocker or bell-pull or girl in waitingli  was very much puzzled to think by what agency he could have beeen announced, and, wanting a great deal, was more puzzled to think of framing it all in one brief answrer. He spent a few seconds seeking for some idea through the fen of his tangled beard, and then procrasti- nated still more by an appeal for sympathy: "Just let me get a little warm, and I'll tell you all about it, madam." "But who're ye, to dome and malike yer- sclf so coolly at home in an honest sick wo- man's house and she-i, WYhat call yer mean V" The female raised herself half-frightened in bed, and the dingy bed-clothing falling down revealed a haggard countenance and thin shoulders, -pinched to the bones by these jackals,- misery and hunger. "Lie dow n, old woman," said a growl from the jungle; "I'm too tilred to wait for you to give me a chair. You could not do it, though, if you wanted to, could you? Dainn the mlan! you don't look like you ought to sit up even."  Assured by this smnall touch of sympathy, or overawed by the high tone of the intru- der, the invalid again disposed herself on her mean bed, and the speaker proceeded to azlle himself at women. Drawing a chair close to the hearth, he sat down, placed his burden on his knees, and, diving into innu- merable dirty but fine garments, finally produced two white little feet, which he held at a proper nearnesst to the fire and began to stroke with his swarthy hands. The lamb laughed loud at the cosiness of this situation, and the woman exclaimed, scarcely above her breath: "Howly Vargin! what a trate child i" The jungle sat immovably, and the lions gazed intently at the red flames which -burned and fumed in the chmney-place. ' A small deal table stood in the centre of the room, and along the whole of one side trousers, and jackets, and other seaman's toggery dangled from one -or tw o racks, - called technically clothes-horses. Some cooking utensils sat as household gods on the hearth, and a high tin coffee-pot, with its spout at the charge bayonets, looked like a sentinel in the first moment bfalarrn. The genius of the place, though, was an iron   boiler, that, suspended by a'soot-covered hook from some point up, the chimney, kept up a witch-like but cheerful "double, dou- ble, toil and trouble" song, which suggested much pleasanter things than the boiled hell- broth of Hecate. In truth, to the poor in- valid its steam was a Fata Miorgana filled with-instead of palaces and groves-the fries fish, and coffee, and other luxuries which should deck her table on the corner to-mor- row, provided she was wMell enough to sit at it and finish Jem's sou'-zoester.- Above the rude'fire-place several shelves, inclosed by two broken glass doors, held some clothes neatly folded, a few shells, and a few pieces of sea-wecd, whose lon(r feelers, kept in mo- tion by the little air' stirring, seemed huge spiders, ever 'restless and doomed to an Ixion-like vain grasping with thecir yellow arms. Every thing was sea-like-salt, dim, and dank as the hold of a ship. An old wardrobe, sorving the. double purpose of a cupboard and closet, colmpleted, with two or 'three miserable chairs, the furnitulre of this garrety cave. The kettle bubbled and sputtered with the spite of King Demorrorgon; the. fire- light flickered and fumed, throwing weird, ghostly shadows, of the empty trousers on the wall; and still the stranger sat immova- bly, while the lanmb had dropped into a quiet sleep. All that proved the stranger not asleep too was the slow rublbing of the dainty  feet. Witlhout --nlore properly ,above-the tempest beat the earth with the same sound as that with which it dashes on a vessel's deck, and perhaps the lion-eyes saw down there among the red flames a time long past, when he, the child of nature, lifed on the sea, reveling ink its beauty and dauntless in its rage; when his heart wass as free as the wind that wafted him, his -head as clear as his bilnnacle-light,'and the only tender eyes he looked into were those of the Pleiades-and stars look altways ten- derly. Perhaps the strlanger dreamed a dream that he had found a flower by the sea and loved it, but the flower was borne by some soft wind far from hiln, had fallen in a sunny place and was happy, until he, chaneing thiere again, and stung with mad jealousy, had plucked out its heart and left a withering canker in place of his lovely   bloornm. Tliorns in the foot bring tears and tenderness even to the eyes of lions. Re- gret! remorse!-thorns in the soul! Will the beasts so wounded colne to our Andlro- clcs, Christ, to be healed and loved, and fol- low ever after the tender healer of these fes- tering sores? The occupant of txe truclde-bed bccanme at last too curious to remain longer still. She rose painfully, threw a tattiered shawl about her thin shoulders, and lhoblbled a few steps toward the fire. Sle was imnnediately  made aware of lher inability to rwalk, turned and nearly regained her bcd when she fell heavily against its side. Her fall and glroan aroused the dreaming man.  He hurriedly laid thc,lambl on his vacafted chair and rushed to raise the fallen woman back to her warmn place aniong the dingy covcrlets. "T lherc! thanr yer, flank yerl, thaznk yer. Upon Ine sowl, a shuldn't 've thriced it; a miht 've known that blisthhered plank 'Ud thhrip me." She sank on her pillow willth closed eyes a moment, then opened thel;n quickly, say- ing sharply:  Andl( wlo air ye, so rough and sokind? Och! ye's a sailor-inan, and hiven knows they've bin good to ine." The stran,elr, pulling off h1is squlelchedl cap, sat do-wn on 0ne side of hler bed, replyr- ing with perfect composure: 'm'in a good sailor, hMaot.(, and F Il try to. -be a good man if you'll do somethin for me. If you don't, why I'll have to tip lier to Davy Jones, that's all." "The child, the child! plase CrinS tleC little darlint to me, plasc! The awfulcst rage of St. Peter fall on yer if yer ldon't lave ue the biassced, swate little ldarllint 1" The woman again raised herself, moaning, on one sharp elbow, and her whole excpres- sion was one of intense anxiety as the intru- der walked slowly from the bcd to the. fire, raised the sleeping baby on his tanned palms, and conveyed it to the outstretched I arms and ycarning bosom of the stricken invalid. This done, a smile of joy replaced the late look of fear, and she pressed it close , to her heart as she lay down again. The I contrast thus presented by tihe full-clleeked, t tender face of the sleeping child, an(d the r ghastly, pinched features of the crono was Y .      .        . * '"   scarcely less striking than that of the same fairness with the lusty ugliness of the jun- gle. The latter half-animal, half-vegetable individual did not seem moved by any con- ception of this antithesis, and sat calmly looking on while the woman continued her feminine caresses. "Poor Dugaldl ye were as pretty and winsome as this yerself oneatnme by, but ye are gone from me now." She kissed the child and buried her face in the pillow, the long frame seeming con-   vulsed with throes of grief. When she raised her head, the jungle was no longer there, the lions no more peered ravenously at their prey, she was alone with the abandoned lamb. At that moment the inky rain closed around a large, coarse form, and the strange man went as strangely as he had come. God have mercy on his desolate way, on the desolate lamb, and on the lamb's mnisera- ble but now somewhat less desolate invalid protector!   CHAPTER 1II. 1* THBSE sketches I made (not to be too explicit) - From two honest fellows who made me a visit." A Fable for MCtIs.   IT was early in the spring of 1864 that Mark and -Leopold Wilton were spending a brief 'absence from their command, then serving in Virginia, at their home in inland -Georgia.. Ten glorious days, whose hours were all too few to hold their joy, and whose wings glittered more b1rightly in- proportion as they swept sunnily and rapidly on, had brought close the season of return to duty. Every evening was spent in company of dear friends, and the indispensable -ulsic of voice or flute was indescribably pleasant; yet the gentle sadness which, like the crim- son cloud floating about the dawn and sun- set, seems to accompany music and love, united with the dread of separation and coming evil, was sometimes too painful, re- vealingitself more than once in tears on the lashes of their feminine associates. Clearly, there was nothing left but to crowd more closely, if indeed it were possible, their en- joyment into the ever-diminishing time, and it was arranged to spend an evening sailing about a neighboring lake. This, spanned by- a ruste-bridge, and hurling with somewhat of a torrent's wrath its abundant supply of water over a half-natural, half-artificial cas- cade,  well adapted to the excursions of friends and lovers. Here, at the appointed tiine, the little party of four assembled and embarked.  The long moss, which hung about the limbs of the larger trees like the serge of gray-stoled monks, cushioned the bottoms of the two diminutive vessels; but the -silken sails of Cleopatra "upon the river of Cydnus" were wanting, as other displays of the beauteous queen, only the strong arms of Mark and Lee acting just as well for mo- tives in point of utility, and rather increas- , ing the true sentiment and romance of the voyage.   "Adios!" shouted Miark. "Portez vous bioen!" chimed in sister Ma- riette, as these two pushed off and gallantly took the lead in their canoe, styled "The Lady of the Lake." Alice, standing in the prow of the other boat to enable Lee to use his oar abaft, and waving with one hand her handkerchief to the leaders while she held aloft a wreath of yellow jessamines that her companion had twined about her throat, looked like the "Genius of Youth" in the picture of the launch in the "Voyage of Life." But, gentle reader, I am sure we can never get on amiably with these people, however interesting they may be, unless some slight description of their persons and appearance be vouchsafed to us.- How can we possibly have any appreciation of their characters until we are informed whether their noses are Roman, or Grecian, or pug? As the'De- mon pleads with Launcelot, good Launcelot Gobbo, in The Merchant of Venice, I imagine I hear the feminine reader vehemently tug- g;ing at my elbow, as if there was to be ob- tained a Confirmation of her own decision, that Man and Lee are very, very handsome. W  hiUe their skillful paddles carry them far up the stream, which with Childlike faith pours its tribute into the lap of the lake, let us dodge behind these huge old live-oaks and take a good look at them. Mark Wilton was tall, well-formed, and handsome, in that his eye was clear and pierc- ing, his forehead high and broad, his features, including a smooth chin and mustached upper lip, entirely au fait. A stranger, first seeing him, would notice, perhaps, nothing but a certain grave dignity of demeanor which brought in its train grace of movb- ment, unaffected because the general expres-   son denoted that his mind was engaged with things outside of himself and rarely in- troverted to examllline self-appearances. He had abandoned a desirable place in a neigh- boring college to enter the service as a private volunteer at the age of nineteen, and, having served three years, was now, by consequence, twenty-tvo. Just before Jeaving Virginia, to visit his flamily, he had bfeen made a lieu- tenant and placed in charge of a mounted detachment of the secret service corps sta- tioned at an outpost on James river, where- and, if the reader has ever been a soldier in that noble State, I am sure he will mal;e no demur-we w-ill presently follow him. His sister, Mariette, just turned of eigh- teen, was, by the general verdict of their friends, but a more delicate semblance of himself. Blroad, well-pencilced brows, mild- ly-sparkling, gray-blue -eyes, straight nose and faultless mouth, with a pale olive com- plexion, form a tout ensemble little short of beautiful. And this evening there was in- deed notliing wanting; for the sun, with "L vernilion-tinted fingers," toyed with her long, dark-brown tresses and lit them to a more perfect consonance with the mild eyes and clear skin. Alice Lander was of the same age as BIMa- riette, and had long been her companion and playmate. Together they liad braved the perils of the existing system of education for femnales.- Grief, the lights and shadows of life had bound them molre closely to each -other. Together they had grown in accom- plishments, knowledge, and faith; and they had studied as in some small way to realize the maxim of the great Ruskin: "Mhan's use and function is to be the witness of the glory of God, and to advance that glory by his rea- sonable obedience and resultant happiness." Alice's face was a rich brunette, with no glaring ilrregularity of carving; and if you chanced -within the charmed circle of her vivacity, or under fire of her " argent-lidded eyes," you would scarcely notice any other- points of feature. Bravery, earnestness, goodness - these were qualities in the character of Leopold, and, united with a fine mind and graceful person, made a hero worthy of a better bio- grapher. In this connection, behold, good reader,   the immense advantages of practice and re- flection - For, whereas, at first, when you began to study these characters, you could see nothing but Mark TWilton's cravat, or were only anxious whether or not a waterfall did deck the beautiful head of Alariette, you Ho now look straight into the soul of Leo- pold, and, seeing there cruel-tender Rdbe- spierrc-passiori contending with reason and moderation, care not a whit whether llis Con- federate grays be tights or peg-tops, his shoes patent-leathers orblrogoans, praying de- voutly that God may defend the right and preserve the moral constitution of our hero from despotism and red republicanism alike, Our young mariners explored the creek far up toward the great spring that was its source. They dived in and out, under and- among the leafy bowers and bays folrmed by the branches which ovcrhun and I kissed the water's fair cheek. With cheery laughter they set the echoes to ringing through the arches of the wood; they gathcred--mosses, and flowers, and clean-washed pebble-stones. Every moment-and it is the same to all whose hearts are attuned with the halrmony of nature-held its own proper enjoyment. So they glided on until twilight, "like a feather from an eagle wafited downward in his flight," fell on them from the wings of the flitting day, warningto return. Now they determined to float back on the tide, tending slowly-toward the fall, while Mar;i- ette read some pretty passages from the sweet, strong poems of Mrs. Browning. The enthusiasm of the girls was aroused to. a spirited defense of the portrayal of woman's constancy and the power of her loveliness over fierce animals. Alice, blushing, threw aloft her banner and stood by it with all the spirit of an Amazon.            . "Mark, when we get back to Virginia, you must not allow any feminine loveliness to come in so much as a mile of our camp, else we shall wake some morning to find our horses both strayed and stolen." "Never fear," said Alice, laughing; "I expect your old  horses are  mettleles3 enough to remain where they are, with your male unloveliness, having the com- fortable surety of a Confederate ration at least in the morning." "Now, look you, Miss Duchess May,   there lies the very point of it, and it doth cut away all the credit of the mettlesome steed. It is writ, All- flesh is grass, and it follows that the horse, being an aninmule of sweet tooth and taste, doth incline rather to the succulent grass than the new-raked stub- ble of Sinteged's chin. The dullest horse in Wilton's squad will turn him quickly fromnt too-long-pulled fodder to sweet, new- mown hay- "Heigh-ho!" ejaculated Alice in the midst of Mark's bantering. "New-rnown " he continued. "Heigh-ho!" moaned Mariette with a long sigh. "Ladies and gentlemen!" gravely com- menced the lazughee, "I perceive that my want of perception bringeth us all to grief; for ye groan reflecting, upon1t, and I groan too, being so keenly reflected 'pon,; wherein, mark ye, I fail to resemble Memnon's statue which, every morning dezoly kissed by sweet Aurora, answered with the joyful twang of a jewsharp. c6anaes! I should say by the remains of Tom Hood, it is like looking for a needle in a hay-stack to find this joke." "Not in the hay-stack-upon .... on the fihay, man!' gaspedr Lcc. "Now, by the soul of Queen Esther," said Alice, "bring hither a grape-vine and let's hang him high as Haman.' This sally of Queen Esther roused afresh the laughter of the happy party to such a pitch that the dreamy bushes, sleeping in twilight on the lake's margin, were stirred as by a breath of wind, and the echoes there- of will- perfectly keep firom being overheard the answer I will now make to your ques- tion, eavesdropping reader, whom I left dodging behind the oaks. Thou wouldst know if this is what thou art, without the assistance of eye or voice or magic presence, to be amused at through all these following pages!         , Patience! and think how sad that what is common in novels should be so rare in common life, and the common in, common life should be so rarely found in novels. Let's thank God for photography, while we weep the absence of Angelos and Raphaels! Remember, you want cards for your sweet- hearts album now, not frescoes to deck the Sistine's heaven-like roof! Friends, accept   a few homne-pictures to glance at on an idle summer morn, when sky'and earth are mar- ried by that king and priest, the blessed sun, his very sunligcht prophesying joy. Hush'! we talk too loud: we must have betrayed ourselves; hear what false Leopold is saying!"Women are more constant in  breaking vows than aught else. You laugh at lovers' peljuries. If he punished them, Vule would havef to run his smithy night and day, to keep him supplied with bolts." "Let Juno have the puPnishment of the male criminals, and I fear there would soon be no boys for us to love," retorted sister -Mariette.  "Too many people begin to love and vow firom mere curiosity," argued Mark. "They are like the man of Antqutera, in Irving's story of ' Mine Host.' A marble bull stood in the plaza of the village with these words engraved on his forehead, En f rente del Toro, se hallen tesoro, and a spring leaped from the darkness to the light through his open mouth. One interpreted -that it was meant in the forehead of the bull there are treasures, and coming at night, burst the carven: head with a mallet. 'WYhat do you think he found?' said mine host. ' Coldl and dialmonds, of course,' ansnreredl the breathlless Sancho. ' He found nothing,' rejoined the story-teller, ' and ruined the fountain.' "So, seriously. "Tis an ower true tale.' Ah! how many of us enter with light hearts and rude hands the temple of God, whose vestibule is life, and, unable to appreciate the true meaning of its worship and the whereabouts of the treasures, dash to pieces with reckless or careess inmallet all hope of finding out the word that God miaketh." His words were made impressive by his half-broken tone and a scarcely audible sigh of the rising night wind. Alice gave him a long look of love, which being, as De Stael says, the only interpreter of music, is also the most cherished reward to men for vheroic deed or private sacrifice. On the ride homeward Matriette amused her companions with some bits of gossip learned from a physician friend of hers. "The doctor," she said, "was called to attend an actress. His patient complained that in one of the performances in Mobile, a mixture of drama and balletj 'she must   have turned her liver over, it felt so.' My friend's advice was very simple. He advised her to somersault backward, if the unfortu- nate act had been a somersault, and, smiling, assured her of his confidence in her restora- tion to health." "As a schoolboy finds a stray arrow by shooting another in the same flight," said Lee. "Hush, sir!" pursued Mariette, "it's a sad story. Her disease has since nearly baffled Dr. Hart's skill, and her condition was, for a time, very critical. I was inter- ested about her, but mighty jealous. I as- sure you, Alice, he did not come to see me but once in four days, and then the few minutes he could spare were spent in telling me ever so many things of this sweet, lady- like, afflicted danseuse." Then Mariette. as- sumed such a pleasant, aggrieved, pouting expression, that Mark was compelled to kiss her with all his might to smooth it away. "Jealous of an unknown, dying ballet- girl, my sister? Did you learn her name?" "Miss Laroux is the one she gave, and Dr. Hart declares that he has confirmed his   own guesses, that she was an orphan of good family, in New-Orleans, and, unwilling to-re- main in that city after its capture, had been reduced to almost absolute want by the dif- ficulties which the world opposes to women. He learned this partly from her sick raving1 and in part by extensive inquiries. I con- sented to take her to our house when she was able to be removed; but two weeks since, Dr. Hart and one of the prettiest mornings of May found her not. , The bird had flown. A note, with some moriy, was left to reward, 'in some poor measure,' so it read, ' the kindness of the best friends she had ever known."  With such serio-comic talk our party spent the evening. The duet, whose words from Burns and music by Mendelsohn were very toubching to Mark and Leopold, about to retulrn to war's stern alarms, was sweetly rendered by the girls, and lingeringly they separated. Whattime they shall reunite, whether it shall ever be on this earth, they felt to be among the infinite mysteries of Heaven. 3-*   CHAPTER      III. "HAVING, on the first sight of the lady, settled the affair in my fancy that she was of the better order of beings, and then laid it down as a second axiom, as indlisputable as the first, that she 'wore a character of distress, I went no further. I got ground enough for the situation which pleased me."   TInREE clays' steaming through the Carloli- nas brought Alarlik and Leo to the terminus of the railroad,. where they arrived about noon. Here their horses- waited to carry them over the twenty miles of distance yet remain- ing, to the outpost. Whistled duets, snatches of hunting songs, and humorous comments in all they saw or felt, beguiled somelncwhat the lagging time, and gave entertainment to the pleasant season of youth, which is happy because it is so-easily amused. At 'sight of a startled squirrel leaping across the road, Leo launched into some deer-hunting adventures he had enjoyed in upper Georgia during the first months of the war, when, being too young to enter the service, he was for a time separated from his brother. "It's a hard story, Mark; but I killed a splendid deer once with small shot." "Indeed, you must have prevailed on the god Faunus with some magic art to press the juice of a narcotic herb in the victim's ear, and so caught him asleep." "No, sir; but nothing is to be lost in an occasional sacrifice to Fortuna. I was cross- -ing the mountain to shoot ducks at Ghor- melly's Pond, and, you remember the little glen the road winds through about half a mile below the rock? Right there I was star-  tled by the sudden bay of hounds just below me. - Luke ran forward with a quick bark, and in few seconds a deer came jumping ,across the path forty yards ahead of me. It was a neat shot at the best, through such a net-work of trees: imagine my surprise when he tumbled with the report of my gun I I thought I was the victim of the spell, and -I walked up carefully enough, expecting every minute to see him fade away or   to undergo some strange metamorphosis. He was dead, though, and I found that, by a singular freak, one half, of mnry shot had entered behind the shoulder in a lump like a square dice pellet: the others were just under the skin. I did not go for ducks that day, and, waitinx for the hunters whose dog had jumped the d6er, dividedl the .spoils and trudged home with the feelings of one who had triumphed aliike over nature and magic." "Faix, and death to 'cm! The Yankcs are like to give us plenty o' chances soon to practice shootin'," said Corporal O'Hara, who had brought their horses to the rail- wray. "Let them come; we will not have any Pcan-antics among our boys." "Pigs might fly, though they be very un- likely birds," proverbially retorted O'Hara. 'D-n your prov-"Lee was bursting with, when he was interrupted by Mark's inquiry of what was going on below. "Two of the boys crossed last night, and report a lot of thransports at Norfolk. K I ,suppose they mane to march up this side the river and take Pethersburm. Och! the bullets of forty thousand men would fly about our ears faster than ycr small shot, Mister Leopold." This idea seemed to give infinite satisfac- stion to Dugald O'Hara, for he chuckled and winked his small eyes mischievously. The jolly Irishman was a singular .combination. He was more than thirty years old perhaps; his head was streaked with gray, but he was very active. He was brave-few of his coun- trymen are not-but a braggart and full of vanity. On the left corner of his cap-visor was a small half-moon cleanly cut from the leather. Above his left eye was a deep scar,'   evidently an old wound. The part of the 1 cap was carried away at Bull Run; the piece A of the headcl, in the "charge of the six hun- dred."  Manassas and Balaklava brought o face to face.              c "Strong cahtort agenst us," he would say; c "Roosh and Yanlk trying to swallow up the t world"                  ES His life was full of adventures, his mind ] of Irish saws, his heart-perhaps only his E enemies averredl the last-of envy. He was f selfish, yet often exclaimed, "Wbhat's the i hodds as long's yer 'appy!"He was shrewd ] and persevering, but cried like an infant at I any decided failure. -A good companion, and withal very superstitious. He, had sailed before the mast in the Pa- cific-Ocean, and had made a fortune specu- lating in California. Alas! he had also seen the last vanish in the smoke of devouring flames. The Iron Duke, with whom, as an extinguisher, Destiny put out the light of Napoleon-the boy England not being able to sleep o' nights with that flare in's face- had patted his childish head. He could tell you anecdotes of the old Irish gentry, or yarns of the sailor, or inci- dents of the mines. Let him henceforth speak for himself.  The information just communicated filled Mark's mind with the responsibilities of his place, and the party rode for some time with- out a word. Approaching to within a few miles of camp, Mark was roused from his reverie by seeing a female figure, attired in neatly-fit- ting dark habit, and well mounted, emerge from the woods into the road and canter rapidly toward his cavalcade. He turned to inquire her name of O'Hara, who, having preliminated, "That's Miss Lucy Pegram, of Castlewood," had begun one of his appo- site stories, when he was interrupted by   losing one of his auditors in the person of Mark Wilton. That young gentleman -sud- denly spurred his horse madly, and dashed off at a Mazeppa pace down the lane. The cause presently revealed itself. Between our party and the equestrienne was the en- trance to an avenue conducting to a large re- sidence two hundred yards from the road. Her horse getting opposite this -open gate, and probably used to entering therein, or frightened by the clank of sabres, wheeled instantly to the right, and the lady, unsus- pecting- such treachery, was thrown violent- ly to the ground. A few seconds brought M ark to the spot. He had partially raised her, and was brush- ing away the sand that sparkled on her hair, when she recovered sufficiently to rise and protest that it was impossible to be hurt on such soft ground. Blushing and stammner- in(rg, she acknowledged his assistance, pretti- ly vowed vengeance of starvation on the ca- pricious Nellie, and declared her ability to walk to the house, fwhere she was well known. "I am sure, sir, from your dress, that you are a rebel. I beg you to ride on to Lieu- L tenant Wilfon's post and inform him that a gunboat is coming up the river below the I point. You will forgive, in a woman, nmy i cowarldly hlrste of retlreat. Receiving this alarm, our youthful officer so far forgot his gallantry that he made no bow to his pretty informant, but sprang to b his saddle and- gave the order to gallop. In a brief tinme they were receiving the e welcomes and congratulations of their com- r rades. They foulnd every thing quiet, for o the Yankee had only chased ashore a small g boat, in which two of the boys were fishing, 1, and returned to its anchorage without deign- )- ing to throw even a stray shell after it. Y   - CHAPTER IV.  "A TIDE death-fraught."   PROFOUND, undisturbe'd by tlrouble of un- . rest within or alarlll of cneiics -ithhout, was C  the sleep of our heroes. You can not long r restrain the spirit, the enthuisiasm of twenty and twenty-two years. By bitter disappoint-  ment, by the most poignant grief, they are  only bent as plants by scorching winds; when they pass they spring balk, and, with a what of life is left in them, renew their I growth toward the sun. Mark and Lee, re-  covering during the journey from the blow i of separation, which, however, is ever light-I est to those who go forth to new faces and scenes, were again jovial, light-hearted, ear- nest soldiers, awake to every impression of beauty and mirth. They keenly enjoyed the next morning's entertainment, comparing notes of events in the past few weeks, answering, a myriad of interrogations about the folks at home; "How do they stand it?". "Ts the war popular still?" "Dil-the gilrlsfCte you, lieutenant 2' 4 You were fairly made a flow-elry Dans=, ell, Lee " Thile reply to one of which-"CGo it, boys; every womcan in the South is at your back " woAa shout at breakfast, and extortel from the densely-packed  mouth  of Corporal O'(Hara a eulogy on girls in general and Southern girls in particular, in shape of a sentiment which he declared a "dhrop of DhrogledaL usquebaugh woldl jist nately sason." - Hlere's to the leddics o' Dixic, heaven bless their pretty sowls and the divil to him as denies it!" He tipped off a huge tin cup of unsugared Confederate coffee, no small portion of' it finding- its Eway out of the two corners of his mouth and trickling in little cascades down the front of his homespun shirt.   Grand Arin, in all the drawing-rooms of listory, hath bent chivalric knee to wo- man-hood, saidl tark in acknowledlment. "AWoman!" exclaimed O'Hara tragically, t she's the lory l1ore of chrcated bein's 1" "1 A sort of rare, clean pearl, while mwe're just common oysters?" suggested flee in atnendment.

Old Mo- ther Jeems  iveer is the most faittJul com- missary, after all." "-Here's a miserable bivalvc," Braxton ac- companied this sentiment with a sigh and with hugging a delusive phantom between his breast and two long bivalvularl'arms, "that's paspin' to fold a pearl to his muddy heart!" it Ha! you must get wounded, man. ' The nussel, bitten by the sea-worI,' saith Jean Pait, if I'm -not mistaken, 'straig(htway closes the wound with a pearl.'

That's the mode."  "Pearl! here's my heart-to freeze 'to I Worm! here's my right arm-to be bit off!" said Braxton, holding his right hand, with greact heroism, in the steam that rose in a dense cloud from a pan of oysters stered. t  "Bit off? burnt off you mean, sir,"' inter- \ posed Lee. "But Sczvola's heartand mouth  1 are too full for utterance, and I will speak for him. Lars Porsenna 1' (to Mark,) there   be three hundred other youths ready to suf- s fer thus ere -"  "'Good! chorus, chorus!" chorused all; ' and King Porsenna led, accompanied by all thile Roman youths in a din of voices:  "Do you belong to the rebel band? Do you belong to the rebel band? Do you belong to the rebel band? Here's nmy heart and here's my hand," etc. After breakfast, M1ark walked down the river to take an observation toward New- port-'News. It was along the prettiest part of the James; as a grand dame might gather her skirts in the courtly halls of Elizabeth, the noble streatn here sweeps its volumed waters into an extensive bay, whose surface could frown nmost royally or snsmile with the innocent grace of a lamsel. '1*Having entered nealr into the presence of its sovereign queen, tile Atlantic, it floated its train with greater slowness and pride; it was preparing for the audience-salute of Old Point Comfort. All quiet below! and Mark wastwithdrawn frorn the dream in which he would fain have lingrctl to discharge the onerous duties of his post. There was corn to be hauled; re- polrts were to be heard; dispatches to be written and sent; the cavalry furniture of twenty men to be overlooked, that what was wanting rmight be put in requisition; an ad- ditional scout and picket-post was to be es- tablished on a road it hadl not been deemed necessary heretofore to guard ; the tenth in kind was to be collected for the maintenance of his comnmissariat; two strolling Yankees had been arrested and were to be marched to Petersburg; all the annoyances incident to an independent command, be it a squad or an army corps, occurred to him. But his disposition was too serious to yield its balance to these trifles, and he pos- sessed the rare ability to conquer the influ- ences -of the world by lifting his thoughts into an, altogether empyrean region. He was gentle as a woman, but he could be as stern as a man. If he was tenderly admired by his subolrdinates, it was not because he pandered to that innate tendency of volun- teer soldiery to scout at discipline. He groomed his own horse; it was, therefore, late at night ere hesought the delicious, al- most indispensable, consolation of music. Thought, reverie, half-conscious dreaming   succeeded the wild, harmonic flute-notes he loved so well, and toward morning, half- disrobed, he slept.  lie wak roused by the entrance and hur- ried words- of Lee, who was on duty at the beach-post. "Up, Mark, quick! I have heard oars close into shore." Marlk had only to pull oh boots and coat, to seize bhis gun, and, shouting a conmmand in the door of each tent, "Meet me at the one gun parapet!" followed his brother. It was a night of intense, terrible, oppres- sive darkness ; its only light was a- gloomy mist. At such times one fe. s the need of invisible protection from ini ible danger. As the tlousand armns of the sea-nettle, the blAcXiess wraps its folds about your face and form, and all the earth sems'a miipty, damp catacomb, with your torch' biown out  and ,' all the dark a' mutter round you" ac. you walk. A hiighl cliff lines this side of the bay for more than a mile. Equidistant from its two ends the spades of thirty years ago and the colrrosion of the intervening time had worn oult a landing. The wharf, which originally extended five hunded yards out above the water, was almost totally destroyed by fire at the abandtonment of Norfolk, in 1862. A little oyster-house stood on one side of the hill, on the other the bluff -had been made a L brenstwork by an excavation behind it large i enough to accommodate one gun and its- crew. Peering over this work, MarXlk could hear a coarse, grating sound, as the enemy's boat slid up on the sand; he could just see Ithe outlines of movingaforms. "tCharon lands his freight of spirits, whispered Lee. e "D-n 'em! lets see how many we can keep in H-ades!" was the muttered reply. They heard the steps of their comrades behind, the enemy would hear them too; ; there was no timlne to be lost. Mark chal- I lenged, received a multitudinous mutter in a reply, and fired. His men blazed away as -they came up. The fire was fiercely returned. e A bullet from below struck the edge of the battery, filled Lee's face with clay, and -hurlined above his head. Braxton felt a sudden, sharp pang through r his wrist, as he was biting off the end of a   cartridge. "Lee," he said coolly, "t Sc- $c-Scovola's hit!"Iil see this little game out, and then, ho! for theT Virginia pearl! It don't hurt much,' and he continued to load, ramming home the charge. With one hand he raised his gun and-fired his last shot. The next moment the worm   bit deeper-its poison-slime reached his heart. The  Yankees  were  undaunted, and charged, bravely clambering, by rocks and projecting butts of timber, to the top of the wharf. It grew lighter, and they could see no enemy, only the Minie balls kept up their rain of blood. At this moment a new sheet of flame darted at them from the very top of the little oyster-house. Five of the rMen, led by O'Hara, unwilling to -cross the , open place of the ascent, exposed to the ene- my's fire,hadd' crept to this position, and their;double-barreled shot-guns gave .them the strength of a platoon. The storm of shot was irresistible. A Volley of curses, execrations, and groans suc- ced, and the invaders rushed precipitate- lyaclk to the beach. The defeat was perfect, but 3ould not be immediately perceived and followed up. The survivors were enabled to /eenbark, but were pursued far out by the Shots of the excited victors. Da n disclosed the usual after-scene, though- in miniature, of a battle-field. Its dim, -gray beams fell on three livid faces and motionless bodies-two of the last in blue, one in jean uniform. Poor Braxton! he gave his whole body to the grave-worm, and he has won the 'pearl of great price,' " said SMark mourn- fully. "Come, boys, let's carry him to his tent." 'That's so" continued Lec; "God must have up yonder some such meed for courage in a righteous cause." Several guns lay on the wharf. An oar, seemingly broken in hurriedly prying boats off the ground, rested partly in the water, part- ly on the dry land, the latter half dashed with blood. tIhere was a track as of a -    wounded man being dragged along the beach; it was spattered with red stains. " O'Hara followed this trail until it disap- peared behind a group of rocks, whllich, standing in the edge of the water, Lad been tide-washed into the shape of a rude altar. He was startled by a deep moan and a voice imploring, "L Water, for God's sake, water!" Close by him was the wounded man, appa-  rently an officer. It is a part of the character of a brave man-Irish, Georgian, or New-Englandcr- to be generous. O'Hara was quick to .com- passionate and quick to disengage fromn the Yankee's shoulder his canteen, that he might fill it with that which to the wound-fevered patient is an elixir of life. Striding back toward the spring in his energetic walk, O'Hara unstrapped the flask. He thought it felt heavy'; he turned it up; a pale, red' liquid, like lavender, escapedl. O'lIara con- ceived a suspicion; he applied the mouth of the flask to his nose. Did the head of Medusp glare back at him? He was spell- bound, aghast with delight. He wMas speech- less for joy. Gradually the charm relaxed. He twisted the canteen this way and that, held it up between his eye and the light: his feet slid, away front each other, so that he looked like a straddled clothes-pin: his head fell back gently and his eyes slowly closed, while an expression of calm resignation suffusedl his face: he kissedthe region of the cork, and there was a prolonged gurgle, like the sound of a rivulet's murmur. That morning, the wounded man and the druidical rocks witnessed, for the first time, an Irish jig executed on the sea-shore, and the little caves, hollowed in the bluff, received in their bosoms with seemingly the same sympathy the groans of suffering humanity and the "Paddy O'Routke's the bhay, sirs!" of the foolish, witty drunkard. Let us draw the vail on this bacchanalian joy of filre-water.   CHAPTER V. MOONLIGHT, SENTIMENT, AND SURPRISE.   OF the hapless dead only two mounds er remained. But, to be decently interred in ar the midst of all this natural beauty-could  they look for more, coming with such hearts g( and threatening hands? The wrounded officer was removed to Lieutenant Wilton's tent and his hurt at- T tended to. The ball, entering on the left s side, just above the sword-belt, had lacerated fa severely, without wounding mortally. Yet tl for two days his delirium was fearful. Hlis r agony found expression in tears or groans, a or curses or wild shouts. Cheering, as in N the heat of battle, his brawny frame would be convulsed with its fierce exertion, and v then with a deep moan he would fall list- r lessly back oh his bed, as if, overpowered, he I fell into the ice-cold stinging arms of death I and defeat. Mental anarchy shattered the E sceptre of reason, and the legionary follow- 1 ers of disorganized imagination held lawless 1 sway. Mark Wilton waited on him with almost fraternal tenderness; but not until after a sharp struggle between his aversion and his -pity. He would not slay, even by neglect, one -who already seemed to suffer a punishment nluch worse than sudden death. There seems to me to be something very noble in the sacrifice of hatred .against a whole people to tender pity for a suffelring individtual. The warrior's apotheosis is to be a demon during, an angel after, battle: Clorinda and Florence Nightingale: in the storm ot doubtful conflict, to cleave his bloody way through heady foes; in the rosy calmin of victory, to pour healing bal- sams in the burning gashes his own arm hath made. On the second evening after the skirmish, tark -and Lee were lounging by the suffer-   er's side,.on their primitive beds, reading- and smoking. Mark raised up suddenly, L Oh! did I show you, Lee, the invitation I got this morning?" "No, you did not; where from?" "Here it is: ' June 6, '64.-If Lieutenant Wilton and his brother will come to Castle- wood to-morrow evening, they will give my father an opportunity he desires, to thank them for their courtesy to his daughter on a recent occasion, and at the same time enjoy a horseback ride aind tea-party.' (Signed) Miss LUCY PEGRAM." The words of the name seemed to mingle with the patient's -fancy and strike a bitter note in his sickly dream, for he rudely flung his blanket from him and sat upright in bed. He stared wildly, muttering incoherent snatches of sentences and broken words; but at length, yielding 'to the force rather than the entreaty of his manly nurses, lay downn again. A long silence ensued, and the invitation was for a time forgotten. l "Have you noticed, Lee, the strange antipathy O'Hara has for this poor stranger? Yesterday I asked him if he would riilde for I Dr. Crampton to come and see hm. 'I'll t ;go, sir,' he replied, 'but damn his eyes, I'd ride faster if it was the gravc-di(ger.' This r morning, he warned mle that I nourished a a viper whose venoln was insatiate, till it f reached the heart of its kindest protector. o He won't give any explanation,.but just : shakes his gray head with an air of the e sagest mystery..' is  iI have no patience, Mark, with suclh e self-importance. It's a trick with some men I- to keep themselves on- the height they have n accidentally gained.

I think some ai strange link has bound these men together a in the past. O'Hara has no, love for our a enemies, but liis hltared of thS man is bc- f yoncld all description." '  A ,s one of thenl, he can't hate him too a mnucl; if h hLas grounds for any personal t iCHling, I do o1Ot wsee hy le Wri not speak them to hils best friendl."        ; Lee -was peovish, his words  pointless. t XMark only slmiled at his little ebullition, and c again thoe dimlinutive rill of talk fell into the S pool of tholghtftul stillness.       c Lee walked down to the bay, scrambled ( over the Druid altars whose sullmmnits were i splray-dashed froim the foaming, monotonous-  ly moaning watcr belowr, and strolled along t the be-cL     - It was a beautiful -night. T'he mioon was ; sinkint- into the gloomy cloisters of that ' dark cloud in the west, and its light seemed I ,morc clhaste and holy for the brief tine that remainlcdl ere it would be quenched. In its I reflection, the waves, as after a leap they  fdl backl dow-n the sloping sand, seemed to j have ldepositedl a thousand gli;ttering trea- surCs. A  litl'le strip of shade reflected on it; edgecr every angle 'of the overhanging  bluft. -'The spray of an outjutting. bush on the clifT trembled w-ith the ealrnestness of a mocking-biird which sat and hymnned thereon, and its quivering shadow fell among the shining, tribute that the sea paid to the "moon." The bird-inmage seemed to peck up these innumerable diamonds, and the bird- ling to utter them forth in the notes of his song- Lee quickly seized the moral of his fanci- ful thought and exclaimed bitterly: L Oh I if men could be brought, by some blessed magic, to transmute the golden earnings of their trade into these things that magnify their own souls and the glory of the infinite Father, instead of piling up  silver and misery, shekels and 'worldliness, treasure and all- uncharitableness, then there would be a defense of this their terrible strife for wealth, this battle of gain, this patching up the rents -in the roble of truth with fragile glittering foil. Naught but Divinity can do this work; therefore, get thee, sightless Plutus, to the gate, and ceaso not to implore, till divine grace hath spit upon thine eyes   and opened them to the wonders of poverty and faith. Better than the marble heart and frozen sympathies of the rich man, to feed, like the fowls, on undressed fruits which are the milk of kindly nature, and annihilate that intelligence which can come to such base refinernents!" Y d  protest against soulless civilization I Mtny suchl, bitterer too, have beat against the doors of heaven, and no help sened to come.

God " tenmper the winl to the shorn" wolf or lamb, and wnipe away these bloodl-stains that fleck the souls of persecution and the wan cheek of martyr- dom!    ' Seating himself on a boulder of sand- stone, Lee supported his temples on his hands and gazed across the stretch   of ! moonlit water., j In the character of his brother, the Ideal and the Real were twin rulers.  Himself  As a dreamer. There was hardly a ten- dency to the practical in his composition. L Loving solitude, lih found in it no want of 6 companionship with his sxcs.

To master what was given f him to learn became an instinct. His play- y time even was spent in eliminating alge- e braic quantities, or sitting, like Thorcau, in d inorganic stillness among the merely animal e organisms of the woods. Such persistent d exercise had developed his good mind; but gr he was timid and irresolute; shrank, almost p with the delicacy of a woman, from attrition le with the world. The magic robe' of such a to Prospero must be woven of faith and love. ss Without these, he becomes a weary and e, hopeless, lone-wandering, chance-driven es mastor,  -    "- A dBam Of youth, which night and time have JencheEforever, Still, dark, and dry, and unremembered now., To his sick thought, the end of life isa blasted mountain-top, where death shall press him close to its annihilating, mouldy heart and ghostly winds ^wanton with his breathless dust. Such a spirit, with one it loves, is quies- cently happy: away from the object of its affection, it is eminently miserable. We may not believe in ghosts : yet, if one walks through a churchyard at the witching time of night,-he starts at every cricket chip; an unavoidable awre settles in the soul, as a mist upon the bosom of a lake. Be it the effect of nursery tales or the consciousness of an inscrutable mystery, the strongest man feels its influence sometimes. A dread pre- sentiment of evil filled Lee's mind and shrouded it in doubts of all truth and good- ness. As the vestal moon died on the death-colo-   f red garments of the ruin and vanished in the darkness of those still gates, his pain became intolerable, and he started up to re- turn. Giving the low whistled signal, he passed the sentinel on the wharf and wMas approaching his tent when he was astonished to see a female glide fromnt the slight, star- thrown -shadow and disappear behind a neighboring fringe of hedge. His mind, excited by the mysteries and real dangers which seemed to crowd around him, by the grotesque influences of the night and his own wild-fancies, was yet too strong to wholly admit superstition; and, instantly guessing that it might be some cunningly disguised spy or thief, he ran in pursuit. He gained the road and saw, a few feet from Hitn, the figure mnount with all the ease of an acrobat, and ride hurriedly awav. lie could see dis- tinctly the horse., How was he startled to recognize in it the samre animnial which he had seen throw Miss Pegram in the high road four days ago!   CHAPTER VI. "But welcome, sweet Clarence: my daughllter sall,. be thine." -       Phtird Pcrt of KCing Iletry TVI.   TORTUREi by these doubts, - Lee spent a I miserable niglit and awoke the next morn- ing without beinrr refreshed. Irresolute, he could not be impulsive, and, after much mnis- giving and vacillation, he decided to keep  for a time his own counsel, to ferret out alone, if possible, the object of this visit of espionage. It need not be sai;d that the image/of Miss Pegram was wonderfully transf  ed to hm.  Aorshiping  true wolnanhoo, he felt that, his religion had been profane. It was as if  a sculptured saint had sudlenly stepped firomn off its marble base and becornme a ruthless  iconoclast; as a whirling, mazy gallopade! inserted between a chant and prayer. But few things can cheek the brooding of a serious mind over its own regrets concern- ing its own love. Its fancy is perverse; so  to Lee the raven presentiment las night had conjured up would not quit 'te bust above his door, but remained to utter con- tinually its mournful refrain. Matter-of-actness mnay not recognize pre- sentiment as a word in its small vocabulary. Let it accept another version. Lee was worldly enough to know the dis- advantages under which an absent contends with a present love. A  little skepticism, produced by the vision of the white horse perllhaps, tinged his faith in his sweetheart. He wNas a thoilsand miles from her, the beloved: he was as poor as a church mouse he saw the prbps of his aspiration thrown down by years of active or indolent military life. When still, the soldier is the most idle- when campaigning, the most restless of men. The four best years of his life were already gone, the exigencies of his country demand ing that this-its seed-corn-should be scat- tered in the winter of war on battle-furrowed 'fields rich with the rmoldering corses of heroic sons.   He could not anticipate the consulmmlation of his afltection Confess, falcy-lhater, the  showinig doe no flatter, and ie hlas cause to be poor irn art. It was with small expectation of pleasure thlat he joined ilMark in preplarations to visit Castlewood. It required a great deal of time, paticlnce, and talent-of-shifts to get up thc viiting toilet of these Confeldevate solkliers. aOne had noiclean collar, and a firiendl had to sup- ply it. O'Hara's vanity was not that of the person; nay, he \as rathelr negligent of hislpoor body. He couldl, therefore, furnish nothing but the utmost activity ill borrow- in-, collecting, and doing on. ARklll's wrist- bands were buttonless and -dlcpendedl firom one side of his hand, like the long white ear of a pointer. O'Hara soon transformed their features by the magic of needls and thread. Tlhey now rpeeped out cunning noses beyond the gray cuffs, like the white mice through the cage-bars of Counthlt Fosco. He worked energetically on Malrk's boots till his face was a flame and his coarse gray hair looked scorched about it. Over and over, he belabored his friend's shouldrs with the torn wisp, until Mark became des- perate, seized his hat and ran'out to get his horse, calling after-l Keep a bright lookout, Corporal commanding. I vest you abso- lute pro'0 tm." It was long past the afternoon, the late I all-glowing mantle of the sun was deepening r into purple, as the two brothers threw open the large gate and dismounted at the door of Castlewood house.  A huge elderly gentleman received them, called half a dozen small negroes to take care of the horses, and with mLany of those 1 foolish expressions we make our first ac- f i quaintance, yet with perfect dignity, ushered them up the, steps. His immense corpu-   lence made him walk with lumbering gait, and a large silver-topped cane lent him evi- dently very necessary assistance. This walking stick is a key to one of the entrances of his character, because it re- presents a most notable event in his recent life. On its curiously-chased top was the in- scription, (the young men saw it several days after, when they became more intimate,) in rude scrawling letters, as if carved by the neighborhood blacksmith--"Genl. Jonah Pegram: From   the poor of Castlewood Hundreds. A poor testimonial of their gra- titude to his benevolence." It reveals another trait to say that this charity was not made to walk out, laden and in the sight of men, through an ostentatious front vestibule of his moral nature, but an out-of-the-rway, nearly hidden sicde-door. On such a colonnade, because it is so modest, friends love to towine the westeria and eglantine of loving admiration. There was one thing of which this hugc: man was very proud-his daughlter. Prostrated by sickness, he became as a little child, grateful for the touch of lher hand, peevish for its absence. This was; discoverable in all his actions. It revealed itself in his prideful face and nervous hands as Miss Peogram met them at the door of the drawing-room. "Had we known the attractions of Cas- tlewood, Miss Pegram," began Mark, after formal presentation, ' it would not have re- quired a rencontre and an invitation to bring us to it." Miss Pegram blushed a very little, and was about to make some lively acknowledg- ment, with a woman's invariable "-indeed, sir i" when she was checked by seeing her father's old face dissolve into a universal smile, as he interposed:      \ "I thought soldiers had an intuitive know- ledge of the attractions of farm-houses; if there isn't light enough, they feel for them, don't they? I h1 ve been expecting, every nighllt, since your arrival} my friends, to have to take the field in defense of my poultry- yard." So much simplicity. and hearty jovialness were evident in the manner accompanying these words, that the (resentment, which   electricalily flashed through the breasts of the boys, was as instantly dispelled, and Miss Pegram's "O Pa!" and Lee's "It's a military peccadillo, I think, sir," were fol- lowed by several remarks, which soon broke down the restraints of a first introduction. - The ride-fresh horses being furnished- was completed, and late at night the .party reentered the-hospitable door of Castlewood. Lee had been thrown entirely with. Miss Marian Wills, companion to Miss Pegram and instructress of the younger children. He had,-therefore, found no opportunity to refer, in some quiet remlark, to the appari- tion of the preceding evening, and so dis- cover the. truth in the self-convicting changes of Miss Pegram's face. Mentally filled with  this plan, he htad started to ridle, and wnas, for some time, too abstracted to play, the gallant, alrousing  himseclf with the Imost painful effort to entertain his companion. Aliss Marian did not seem to notice his want of courtesy, but exerted herself so 'wiisonie- : ly that, in a shorllt tinme, Lee had forltotten -L-I ULI  YYI) -VI Ci VI IMiss Peram  ti her adventulre, altd- every thing connected with her except lher tutoress associate.

Re- action is a general mental and physical,- moral, social, and political law-; w-e there- fore want no better pTroofthat thley deve- loped all the sentiment of the occasion thanl  the hearty laughter and good appetite with I which they discussed supper after -their re- turn. Mental tastes so varied produced the0 in- troduction of most varied topics.  Mark had been struck with some dififerences in Virginia and Georgia manners and charac- ter, and discussed Ills imprcssions. The courtly old gentlemna  related some fox- hunting experiences of "auld lang syne,"' precisely as he had related tthen a hundred times before; and, as he lallughed at his own stories exactly in propolrtion as his listeners laughed, le had the pleasurec of being ob- streperous this evening, having polite and appreciative auditors. Lee, at one corner of the table, strove to divide his attention as impartiallI as possi- ble- between his supper, MArs. PegCrani, and I Miss Marian.   "You are from Georgia, Mr. Wilton?" Mtrs. Pegram was morally sure tiat Lee was from Georgia; but she only displayed a little peculiarity of elderly ladies who like to know that they are right. L Yes, ma'am-from M--  . L Ah! I have some friends in M-- ; per- haps you know them well, Mr. Wilton? "Who? what name, ma ami?" inquired Lee, pausing with a concentrated expression- of intense interest. "Miss Wallace, whowe to school with Lucy and spnSnen  wter with us, lives ,there, I think.'" 't Yes.7 "And two summers ago we met at Green- briar a Dr.-Dr. Hart, Who-" O41 I he is our most intimate friend, ma'aln." "What a jovial, polished gentleman he was, sir! How is he doing?" It is worthy of remark that Miss Marian, who had hitherto shown no appetite, deli- cately sipping her tea while she conversed with Leopoldl, now placed her cup to her lips and cdrafik deeply. "Very well. The doctor," answered Lee, smiling, "picks up a joke and,-treaslcre it with mnolre pleasure, I think, from his pa- tients than he does their fees. He had a   sad, partly comical story, rather romantic for the country, to tell us just before we left home, about a youTng lady refugre from New-Orleans, who had adopted the thleatri- cal profession for a support and had met with a most singular accident, by lwhichlh-" Miss Wills replaced her cup in its saucer so hastily as to splash some of its delicate contents on her dress. Risin hastily, she asked Mrs. Pcgram to excuse her, and rc- tired with evident embarrassment, confused- ly brushing the tea-with her kerchief from garment and lips. "What's the matter with Marian?" in- quired General Pegram. Not haviig healrd the low talk of Lee, lie set the signal, by himself rising, to reiire fromi the tal')e. "She has staid away from   her young charges now longer than I ever kncw her to do it before," answecred his wife. Lee's chagrin at having been intcrruptedc in his relation was softened by his ncinory of the trancing charm Miss Alarilan's vivacity and experience 1iad thrown about hilll ; and, since the autlhor is expected to be gifted with a sort of-omniiscience, Mark felt a. singllllar fluttering of the  lecarLt as, solelIhowA, lie tourched Miss Pe-ramis hand mlin tde lark passage when. they ascended to the dlaw- ing-rooin.    CHAPTER VII.

NOTWITHSTSANDING his protestations that t he could defer his pipe as easily as his bro- 1 ther, .tark was banished to the front piazza,  where his burly host sat, surrounded by long stems and a halo of smoke. Lee and Miss Lucy, joined by Mfiss Ma-  rian, wandered through- the 'picture-lined,  i hills and 'spacious wainscoted rooms of th1e  old castle.               J  , t ! i ' I  "I Rebii, behold one of your earliest irede'- cessors in the ancient iniquity of trying to subvert excellent, governments!" Miss Pe' gram pointed with feigned gravity to the portrait of a finely-formed cavalier, yet with / low flaccid browl,}and sharp eyes, in, the dress of the evening of the seventeenth century. "Who is this keen-eyed soldier?" asked Lee. "I am an enthusiast in all antiqui- ties." "It is that arch-rebel, Nathaniel Bacon, -hom history scarcely deigns to mention. Legend alone preserves much more than the- bare fact of his rebellion. He held aloft the banner of his insurgency for a long time, oc- cupying this very ground.  Most of the events of his outhreak, though, occurred on the other side of the river. The Governor was forced to fly, and Jamestown was aban-  doned to the flames and pillage of the victors. Colonel Nat assumed the direction of the colonial government, and the whole current. of American  history might have been changed but for his sudden death; this left his band without any acknowledged leader and torn by internal complications. It is said that, late on the night before his last expedition,- a shriveled old woman came, and that not by any door, into this very room, where he sat writing.; that a frightful storm arose, which shook the house with the force of an angry giant and filled the air with deafening thunder-bolts; that, during it alL he slept with his head upon the table,   and when he awolke, near morning, alone, his plumed bonnet had changed to a gemmed I and sparkling crown, but his plain, black' dressing-robeilad wrhitened to a shroud."' Aliss Wills turned involuntarily to gaze round the dimly-lighted room, as the wind rustled the stiff curtains at- its farther ena, and she saia' somtthinr 'of the oddities ,of\ common traditton, which will I ayc a wolan' in every qac, witeh pr a'gtel, fouotailnrylph j or devil in disguise.,  ",It is only! man's aclnowledgment/ of your potency," said Lee, with soime attempt i at gallantry. "There are few things, a woman loves better than poe'r," returied Mis PAi irt;h ; "but she does not like to be credited with'it, and called a witch.  She loves to be a nymph ; she doesn't want to influence mIan with vitchery, for that impleaches 'her fair- ness." DI "Dear Lucy, they have -false keys enough already to our good opinion; don't give him the best one." 1 "You'll have to change the lock, cease to love admiration. All1 the world have copies of this key," said Lee. - "So youlng, and talks like -a convicted  burglar, in such a brazen key I!" retorted M; liss Lucy, with a smile. "O wicked man!" t. t - A h!" exclaimed Lee, " you are his glory or his destruction, his brightest je wel or his t grave-cloth. You can make his life a field r of poisonous stubble, or cause it to bloom S with sweet, health-exhalinc flowers.

I have not filled a single pipe for lim to-night," ran out to the front piazza.  \ Master. Leopold, thus checked, became suddenly awilre of his high strain, and apo- logized for his monopoly of the conversation, while his face betrayed his confusion. "Miss Wills, shall we find some more ghosts "        a "It is a very interesting old house," she ans ered, and they strolled on. y especial, beloved friend, the gentle reader, knows nothing yet of the outside of the Ir cf. Imagine a star whose points were'not/points, but; convex half-circles, a donjon girt, With a brood of ditninutive outjutting donjons, and you have its ori- ginal shape I Its; inmprovqnents,1 unlike 'the i rick nYcleus,? wctre Qooden, an rl'onsiytedc of a square wing to the right of the building as you rodb up, thb  central avenue . At large piazza, with upper and lower divisions, 8 extended across the front of the new build- ing, and took in its embrace the small balus- tradeld Sally-port Whi'ch formerly : gave en- traricd through the 'principal tower. A snall- er light portico ran round the entire struc- ture. As you approached from a distance along the winding country road, and caught sight of its white and swarthy mass tower- ing in the swirnming twilight, the idea was suggested of a mazy, tumultuous dance, in which the feminine figures were damsels of the present drawing-rooms, with, for part- ners, fantastically-robed knights, while, like plumes, the surrounding oaks waved their lofty tops. In a vain attempt to suit all this irregularity, corridors wound intricately throuh the interior of the castle, marking out the map of the rooms.  Along these Marian led Leopold. They paused in the library to glance-at the books, coins, shells, and busts, which evinced a cultivated taste somewhere. Miss Marian salid that it was the lkingdom of Lucy.. Emerging from its gates into a hall, they caught sight of the moonlight streaming in, and flooding the floor with ghastly bright- ness. They sat down on the window-ledge. Reached their ears, then, the softest, sweetest wail which the harp-queen of in- struments-can utter. "Luoy!" whispered   Miss Wills, and both leanedl out to drink in the ravishing strain. Miss Pcgranm's voice, accompanying, sang the delicious serenade of Schubert. Verbena and hyacinth, oleander and caly- canthus mingled their perfumes to bear up the music, as angels float up a new-rldeased spirit on odorous wings. The moon threw its Mwitchery of pale light over the budding land, and the night-airs, frolicsome, made quivering shadows among the rustling corn. .The giant trees, with long dusky arms, glrasped out athwart the lawn, and clouds, like whitc-trimmedl angel- ships, silently sailed along the skyey sea. On such a night Titania leads her band to fairy-dance among the violets, Oan such, a night the long-frozen springs of the human hearty melt into spouting rills' i of tenderrness and trtfh. i  The'gong ceased. Lee murmutred: d "Music that softer falls Tnlan petals of blownl roses on tle' gralss, \ Or night dew9, on pti'll watelrs, between walls Of shadowy granite in a gleaming pass; Music that genther on thile s5pirit lies Than .tiled eyelids on tired eyes, iMsic that brings sw eet sleep down from the blissful skies." ,  He turned toward his comnpanion.  She stood still, " still as any stdne," gazine as with the never-withdrawn stare of the Knight of Togrgenburcr. He leaned to look in her face. The simply braided hair, the tender blue eyes, the long  straight nose--tihey hardly stirred with  any breathlling, until from the shuddering lids a tear fell gleaming on her pale cheek, and she bowed her head and close-pressed hands nearer to her flow- ing heart. Touched by this exquisite sensibility, ho strove to soothe, caught her hand and ten- derly retained it. Nature carols and bewails and weeps and dreams and loves. Love and dream mwe too, men and women, worms with wings, the first spring of Edlen anrid the winter of the fall in our heart! Most groveling, worm- like, snalkc-like is the heart withl so much winter in it that all its showers are drench- ing sleet, with so little spring in it that no tears comne to freshen up the flowers above the grave of primal innocence. Noiselessly fly passion-fledged hours.   CHAPTER VIII. A FAM ILY FIRESIDE WITHiOUT THE FIRE, IT BEING SPRING.   "CoM1E, lieutenant, let's have a smoke! 'The cares that infest the day' must be smoked out like bees ; it is so easy to make them fangless by the pleasant alchemy of a quiet smoke.  Fill that dingiest-looking bowl! It is from the rlud of the yellow Roanoke, and is, in itself, a symbol and a realization of sweet contentment. Lucy has twice spent my money in presenting mee with meerschlaumns. I express the most profound gratitude for this investment of my funds in sea-foam, devote tale Aphroditean chlartiot to the dust of the library shelf, and quietly retake to iny river clay. There is a stoIrmI, of course, and I get no kiss for one or two days . It's all over then, and still I've got lmy clay. There's no pipe, sir, equal to a cl ay- none, sir.' The old gentleminan's fat cheeks distended with the long-drawn whiff until the big eyes nearly went out, and then slowly collapsed as the columnar or misty parachute rose float- ing in the monlight above his straight scanty, silverfhair. ' So you gave the ma- rines a pretty sound thrashing the other night?" "Yes, sir. They will retain a sore re- membrance of 'the rocks,' I think. Our scout across reports that he sold twenty-five chickens at Yorktown yesterday, and found out that there were not more than five of tile twenty invaders who failed to carry off a ball or a buckshot. He also brought mne the New-York Herald and Harper's of recent dates. I'll send you up one." "Thank you. Is not your crossing a very dangerous business, now that so many steamers fill the river and there is so much cavalry on the other side "  "We have appointed nights to go, sir, and I a new signal for every occasion. Indeed, every thin, turns on the virtue of our agent  over there. A novel danger presented itself   the last trip. We were well out in the channel, -steering for the Warwiclk. The steady workling of an engine had been, a short time before, audible away to the left. It was as-dark as pitch, and no light visible anywhere but at White Shoal light-house. I suddenly heard a grleat rippling rush of waters, and, turning, saw a huge black niass in a. few yards, almost imp ending over us. I had barely time to shout; the boys bent to their wnork, the pilot of the giant craft shrlieked, 'Kseep away!7 and my steering-oar was violently wrenched from  rly hand, while I went overboard, and only realized, my narrow escape when I found myself clilubing aganin to the boat, as it danced on the white, writhing waves." "They didn't stop to look after you?" "No. In an instant the big steamer was lost again in the darkness, and we moved faster, I reckon, than four oars ever carried a boat before." "Singular that you were not alarmed by the crank of her machinery as she camo near!" "I think of but one explanation. As the two boats approached each other on con- verging lines, we got more and more'ahead of the steamer, and perhaps her high- bow had the same effect in deadening the sound ashat you have noticed the corner of a building has in the city. A drum struck one square from you will seem softer and in a totally opposite direction." "The noise of the drum, though, must be echoed against the houses round your cor- ner." "Yes; and the high bluff that lines this shore of the river would serve the same end." "How is your wounded man? Is he a prisoner of rank?" "A captain. He is improving slowly,"   Miark rose in courtesy to hMrs. Pegrafm, who just. then came up frolm the tea-table and her housewiftely dutieA. She dleclined, his offered seat, and, drawing, a low stool  near her husb and, sat leaned against the  arm of his chair. She was a tall woman, of about forty-fivc years, w-ith pale complexion, deep-suniken, calmn, gray eyes, and low, broad forehead. "Do have him brought up here. It is so hard to be sick in an enemy's camp." Her voice tremnbled a little; the divine pity of her woman's heart flowed from a spring ltftely mltced by the wondlerful wan(-- touch of gr'ief: she had lost their only grown  son, a captain-wounded, captured, dead-at Gettysburg. "The doctor says he can not be moved yet," initerposed Mark. "I wanted to send him at once to Petelrsblurg." We must have him here, and save you the trouble of nursing himn, as soon as possi- ble. Fill up again lieutenanut; I never smoke after Janic comnes to pet me. She' has no very decided olbjection to it, but I can not consent to enjoy at the same tilme two such luxuries as she and tobacco." "You have conqueretd him, Mrs. Pegrnln ; but I do not know which to admire most, your success or his grace in acknowledging it." "A Fairly conn tlered, sir, conquered, sir," cluckled the partly old gentleman. "Lucy, daughter, are you going to let'the moon and your old father retire without any music to-night?" With a cheery little laugh and emphatic negation, Miss Lucy went to get het harp; and Mifarl., perceiving what was wanted, had a delightful race with her into the parlor, whence he soon reappeared, bearing the gilded instrument on his shoulder. He touched a gruff base-string in m-D eliek cadence with hitis .step as he tramped out on the piazza, and'humlmed, "Gayly. the trouba- dour," etc. His little attempt at fun was well received, and there was a general mirth and commotion as thie chairs were rear- ranged, while Miss Lucy seated herself at the instrument whose associations led the memory back to the veery birth of poetry, as it chaunts the omnipotent wrath and the in- finite kindness of Jehovah in the song of the   maiden Mfirialn.  Ancient children of that invisible, spaceless power, that with one hand pours its sweetness in the tiny flower-  cup, with the otJAr maps the way thllt uni- verses shall revolve!  'T'here is no word- paihting whch has beauty enolugh on its palette, skill enolugh in its brush, to express the mlusic of poetlry, the poetry of music. "Such language holds The solemnn sea to the stand upon the shore." Men whose souls are locked up in their safes, whose finer feelings he packed away with the wares on the shelves f their busi- ness rooms, can not know this pssion, and we are prone to distrust all we arc ignora1nt of. Terr1ibly false is affectation; therefore, unable to realize the genuineness of tlis "fine frenzy," they call that falsely devil- ish wlich i s well-nigh all we have truly an- ; gelic. Poor is the life, grievous the sin, of one who stifles within him this rustling of the seraplh's wing, and1 tugs at the dragt-ropo of the uprising soul. For this nmelody, whe- ther of verse of painting, of sculpture, or of architecture, (which last Goethe so beauti- fully calls frozen music- Eine erstarrte Musik "piping to the spirit-ditties of no tone," exists to us all, only that, "Wiilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close" us in, we hear it but faintly, and we must listen with strained ear for its dullest notes. Miss Pegraam's taste was well cultivated, and she played with the earnlestness of a devotee. As surges of foazm above the rest- less waves, her white finters leapedl along the shuddelring strings. Her face, pale like her mother-'s, was beau- tiful with its outline of dark hair, its clheek of " snow and rose-blooim, and it;s deep, black eyes. Mark, drinking in the beauty of her flace, and forn, and voice, felt a high, sudden ad- miration which must quickly ripen into love. All the heroic in him sprang into full-sheath- ed being with that great inspiration. It is in this moment of every iman's life that his soul climbs to the summit of its ability, and all his possibilities are nearest   perfection. Between the glimpses of birth and death we get sight of heaven only per- haps in this enrapturing time when that un- known in us germs from the sod of common existence into the sweet, odor-laden air of a pure, unearthly first love. Exquisite serenade! Its prayerful notes, I believe, were worthy to be the wail of banished Eve, as the sword-armed, bared right hand of the Creator closed forever the cherub-guarded gates of Eden. Request after request came from ATark, and were as readily complied with by the musician. It was very late, the old people had sat up two hours beyond their time, as   i they averred, when Lee and his companions were sunmllioned, and all retired to rest. The servants were asleep, and Miss Lucy l lighted the candle which the young men were to use, and gave thenm directions to ; their room. Arm in arm, she and Marian bade them good-night. Some soft glance mrust have dropped, like I a flower, from her eyes into the soul of Mark W to perfume his dreams-; for Lee, who was too much excited to sleep soundly, afterward declared that he continually smiled and rnut- tered that which could not have been from i the inspiration of too much meat or milk at 3 supper.   CHAPTER IX. - POSTHUMUS. Oh! no, no, no; 'tis true. Here, take this too; It is a basilisk unto mine eye; Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honor Wthere there is beauty, truth where semblance!" Cymbeline..,   TiE young men were -roused early the c next morning by the jingling of ice as a I servant brought themn minlt-juleps and Mrs.  Pegram's command: "M iss says it's time I to dress for bruklfas, sah!" As they descended and passed out on the la-wn, which, being the brow of this kingly residence, the dewr seemed to cover espe- cially with dianonds, they caught a glimpse of Miss Lucy arranging some flowers on the breakfast-table. No profound, all-pervad- ing feeling, of religion had ever warmed the  healrt of Mark Wilton, and, stratngely unlike  devotional natulre who so greatly inlfluenced I him, hle had that morning uttered no lmatin pra yers'to the Infinite God. But now the, trenchant power of love conquered what, without this, its valiant captain, the still majcsty of religion niht never have sub- dued. This happy home-scenc, a simply- attired woman tenderly handling flowers, made him breathe a petition for her protec-  tion and tilled him with such a womanly  tenderness that I fear his political. cause would have suffered if in that nolnomcnt he had been called to engage in battle the ene-  mies of his country. Nevertheless, he felt imnlediately after that he would be willing to go through all imaginable and extraolrdi- nary perils in encountering these last if only for a nminute he could be that cirison rose, looking so much lilke a youthful warrior with its thorn-defended leaf-shield, which shone amidst the not very artful braiding of her black hair. If thought be not clairvoyant and conta- gious, there are some inexplicable coinci- dences in reference to it. At all events, the   same idea which had by turns unmanned and nerved his brother flitted through the mind of Lee; for he began to repeat, withl a rogruish twinkle in his eye, one of Tenny- son's pretty levities: "And I would be the giidle About her dainty, dainty waist; And her heart would beat against me, In sorrow and in rest." Both were laughing when they came to where General Jonah sat on the front-stcps, smoking and snapping a huge pair of gar- dener's shealrs at a frisky young pointer, which woufld creep close up to his master 's big foot, and then, as the hIeavy iron prlongs closed sharply within affew inches of his nose, leap back yelping, to remain, witlh dis- tentded jaws, in the crouching attitudde of the- lion, but with the soft expression of a kitten. - ' I am too old and unwieldy to hunt nowt,' said their host, " but still keep around me tile friends of my sporting days. Gome to breakfast, gentlemen! Come, Robert Leo Stonewall!" He lifted on his feet Master Frank, a curly-headed boy-of five or six years, who, had been kneeling to pore over a picture in an outstretched Har2per's Weekly. "Would you like to be fighting the Yan- kees in that battle, Mister Frank? asked Lee. ' Consider yourself fortunate that you are not subject to conscription, young man," re- plied his father. The child's prattling response was lost in the salutations of the young men to the ladies, who had assembled at table.   After the meal, Mhark said that his pre- sence was needed at camp, and, with press- ing invitations to come again as often as possible, they buckled o abres, and pis- tols, and ball-pouches. .While Mark bowed. to pull up the flaps of his cavalry boots, Miss Lucy suddenly drew his sword from the sheath and laid a heavjaccolade with its flat side on his shoulders. "'Rise, Sir Knight of--" "The Rocks," finished Marian. Wilton could not help but blush a little, principally at his own confusion, and, stut- tering some euphuistic compliment, received his weapon. In a few moments he and his brother were waving hats to their fair friends and galloping through the avenue gate. In half an hour or less their horses stopped to drink at the branch four miles from Castlewood. "Well!" suddenly uttered Lee. Not a word had been spoken since the knightly dance of the old castle turrets faded from view. The canter with which they had started nwas now broken for the first time. Occasionally one, as'some new idea occurred to himn, would spur up sharply; the other animal would likewise increase his gait; and so, with alternate lope and fierce  gallop, until the horses stopped of their own  accolrd at the wontedl nwatering-place. "What! Indian   Creekl so soon!" ex- claimed Mtark. Both lauhcled outrlight as each caught sight of the otlher's blank expression of sur- pri se at his own ablstraction. By the same law of reaction the long pent-up risibility , came lil;e a flood. Their laughter increased as thcir pace Ihad, until wild shouts eclhoed through the tops of the bare, bleached pines and startledl the robins in the bushes along I thie swnamp. AVith wroodland fretdoln, youth  assinmilates itself with nature and laughs the frolicsomr e laugh of faun and satyr, and that  devilish good fello, wild. Pwan.  "What a mnaglniicent girl Miss Pegram X is  Lieutenant Wilton threw one foot, across his horse's neck and rode in feminine / position for relief. "How intelligent Miss Wills is!" replied Lee with a smile. "Isn't she beautiful?"Mark pursued, un- mindful of his brother's question.   - - V- w * 'And very generous with it," answered the latter; "so much that she gives -our camp the pleasure of briefly seeing her somne- times by moonlight." "What!   Mark's foot was brought back quickly to its vacant stirrup. "Let me tell you, Mark, all that I know of the singular affair. I would not have credited it with any testimony but my own eyesight. Night before last, as I was re- turning from a walk along the beach, I star- tled a female in. afew feet of the tent which poor Braxton's mess, you know, had given up for the use of our prisoner. The moon had only jtust gone down, and the night was well-nigh as bright as this morning. She leaped lightly on Nellie, the horse we ad- mire so much, and which seems to belong exclusively to Miss Pegram.  The tents must have screened me from  sigght. She- was alarmed only by my step. The groonm who brought our horses to the door to-day told me that Miss Lucy kept her saddle and bridle in her own room, and nobody dared to touch them without her consent. Alark, I saw plainly the large pink rose nwhich she told us she had herself emnbroidered on the saddle-skirt." Mark's bridle-rein fell fronm his grasp on his horse's neck and danledl about his knees. His hands- closed upon liis saddle- bow, and his head bent as if a great weight had dropped a hunch upon his back. Was't possible?  Didn't Lee dream? Miss Pegram! modest, accomplished, ready to flush at every arch remark, breathing such delicious music, so elevated in tone and feeling, and even impulse!  What strangc madness should so cloud her fine nl-ind as to cause her to forget the hour, the place, helrself, all plopriety? Waisshe mad? As eC cwent along this fearful chain of thought, his surprise became denial, ldoubt, anguish.  Lee. saw his face so palej so full of pain, thtt he would have given the workld to recall his ulngvlarded discloslure.!. In a moment he knet that his brothler's nature Ihad been toucheicd fo the quick; that even so rapidly love had grasped his heart with its strong, clenching roots, and grown nearly. to its full. Perhaps he did dream.   Oh! that the vision  were onec whit less distinct!, It   seemed burned into his memory. He yearn- ed to be able to raise his brother's head by saying: "I was myself mad, Mark. It must be unreal and a dream." They reached camp and picketed their horses. Mark's animal was hungry, and seized an ear of corn fom his arm, knocking the other half-dozen down in as many differ- ent directions on the ground. A muttered curse and a kick were his unwonted pun- ishment    What a demon enters into the heart when its sanctity is violated by a black-cowled disappointment! .  " The faithful horse groaned, retired to the end of his tether, and turned his large, strange eyes full upon his master's anger- swollen face. Marlk slowly gathered up the scattered corn, patted his horse's breast, and turned into the deep, clover-lined woods close by. It was dark when he reappeared and sought his bed.   CHAPTER X. APATHY IN WILTON AND PATHOS IN O'HARA-THE ONE OF MND, THE OTHER OF MUD. "TOGETHER in age and love we grew, Roaming the forest aad the wild V1   MARK WILTON was up earlier than usual the following morning, and his horse receiv- I ed a larger share of his attention.   1 There was a great change in his look, his c spirit, and his deportment. When business cares did not occupy him, t he walked with bent head and dejected mien, or sat, perhaps holding a book before his l face, but gazing steadily, vacantly through 1 the window. His liveliness completely for- I sook him. The pickets on the main road two nights before were closely questioned. Nothing had transpired to break the stillness, the wea- riness, the monotony of their watch. An unfrequented path, unguarded, led about a mile through the woods and emerg- ed on'the beach. One could then travel about three miles along the water's edge and again strike the stage-road. Wilton walked over this way before the sun had dismantled the fresh earth of its pearl-studded, dewy robe. He found hoofmarks - leading from the woods across the deep sand of the high-wa- ter line, straight in the bay. The tide was nearly flood; at midnight, forty-eight hours before, it must have been low, and a horse- man might ride on the smooth-washed sand just above the ebb. Why these evidences? Did he doubt that of Lee's own witnessing 9? It is strange, that, when a sudden blow deprives one of something held very dear, the sufferer finds a mournful satisfaction in tracing every link and circumstance connect- ed with the deprivation. When Wilton returned to camp, he spoke lightly in some common jest with the boys, but Lee knew. well the pain which this was only meant to cloak.   The attachment of some men is spaniel- like; their love is strong as a leash. They live in the light of the smile and in the sha- dows of the kindness of the beloved. The basilisk mind of the superior enchains the smaller soul. These men are like plant seeds driven hither and thither; they can not rest and bloom until are found the sunny yet moist, life-giving places they love. They are Epiphytes! The nobler oak receives them to its capacious heart, wraps its gnarled arms about them to shelter and protect. It is a heaven-implanted link of depen- dence; only the scythe of the pale reaper can sever it. It mwas thus that O'Hara felt toward SMark Wilton, Lee's passion was similar, but some- what nobler. The constancy of the brothers had been remarkable. At school they had no feuds. No anger- had thrown the fire- brand of fraternal war in their close com- parnionship. If they were for a time separate, Mark's address to Lee was, "My sweetheart bro- i ther i' If Mark commanded Lee might re- sist a little; in the end he obeyed with a smile. "Mark and I are two halves. Both of us make one." To-day, there was the same kindness of manner; but the consciousness of having r caused suffering, of having discovered, in a moment of weakness, what had not been i voluntarily revealed-his brother's passion - -produced an awkwardness which, in the sensitve, introverted mind of Lee, developed e into positive coolness. So wore away that , .day and the next. s  A week passed. Nothing was exchanged between Castlewood and "The Rocks."   At length, Mrs. Pegram sent down some I strawherries, inquiring of their health.  Lee took O'Hara with him and answered f the kind inquiry by spending an afternoon with the good people. Miss Wills pleaded duty to the children, and did not come in the drawing-room. As they were departing, they sawn her in the small barbican toward the west, sur- rounded by her flock of two or three girls- and boys. "Blood and owns! Marian Laroux V" ex- claimed O'Hara.  "Miss Marian Wills," explained Lee, not catchiing all the exclamation, as he pulled his companion down to the beaufet in re- sponse to the general's never-failing invita- - tion to julep, "just by way of a stirrup-cup, young men."' The corporal smacked his lips, it is said, from Castlewood to camp. Whether the effect was from the sight of   Marian or the taste of the apple-brandy, it even extended to his horse. The wiry little animal grew very impatient as they neared her food; champed her bit into blood and foam; and finally, catching the corporal un- awares-while he was narrating, WithL appro- priate gestures and accompanying spur ring, how he charged upon a Russian cannoneer at Balaklava-started off at a breakneclk run. The corporal was an excellent rider, and rather enjoyed the exhilaration as long as the road continued smooth. But a monky could not have remained on his steed lwhen; instead of turning to curve into the gate she stopped with mule-like sudelnn ess tt the fence-bars. Gallant O'Hara of the -thl dra- goons was left nearly as he left the Russian cannoneer, only one was bedabbled with gore, the other with mud ; the one lay across his smoking gun, the other was dlou- f bled up against the rail-fence.   CHAPTER   XI. WITHN THE DOVE-COTE.   MARIAN WILLS (I will continue to call her so, since she is otherwise known only to my- c self and O'Hara) had been but a few weeks at  Castlewood; yet in thiat short time she had perfectly won the affection ;of Lucy Pegram.  It had been hard for the latter young lady  to totally subdue a little sense of superiori-  ty, which belongs to families of wealth, and especially to those living in the- country- t natural lieges to a whole neighborhood. But the high tone of Alarian's mind, the sen- sitiveness apparent in all her actions, the sad patience of her demeanor, were 'as so many strong endearments to the generous heart of Lucy, and that heart had shown so nmuch tenderness, striving to conceal its pity, that a genuine affection replaced the first feeling of aversion towlard a homeless, depen- dent, andl, as she first thought, too wolrldly- wise w-omnan.  The stream, having once changed its channel, continued to pour its babbling current where, at first, seemed in- r  surmountable hills. Light-brown hair, " sunnier than the wild graipe^ er, in golden-tinted plenty dlown her neck's rose-misted marble" gushing and shading a perfectly blonde face lue eyes, shining under dark brows, as violets by a moss-covered rock; open, couragfeous nos- trils; finely-shaped chin, and' arge mnouth; medium form and energetic step-this was the physical Marian. In Richmond, she had applied to a friend of her dead guardian, not for money, but only for assistance in getting a way to earn it. He obtained for her the place at General Pe- gram' s. She had coune to be tutoress; she was made a friend. Expecting cold respect, she was folded to the arms of warm love. The smallest spark will kindle this flame in, and melt together, the hearts of gentle, impressi- ble women. -   Lucy fitted up for her a boudoir next her own, threw opcn. the common door, and made one dove-cote of the twio nests. On the night after the visit of Mark and Lee, Lucy could not sleep, and, rising about midnight, sat in her window. She could see through the open door into the adjoining room. To her surprise, Marian had hot re- tired, but was hurriedly removing her hat from her head. She called her. 'How vain and foolish it is, Lucy, to be seeing how you did looc. on some past-occa- sion," said Marian, coming in, but speaking with some embarrassment. o- "ot dreaming yet, my friend?"She bent over her comn- panion and quietly stroked the forehead from which the long hair dlepenled nearly to her feet, "!Yes, dreaming without sleep, returned Lucy, " as I dream all day, MKarian. It is very sweet to dream so, and it is so glori- ous to have a sister's share in these dreams. My little, blue-eyed, lost sister! - She would have been as large as you now. If we could only find her! Oh! if I only had a place in the old churchyard to worship at as her gravc! She is'nt there. She's buried, fa- ther says, perhaps in the earth of crime. Will you be a sister to mne, Marian?" ,Marian ceased stroking to imprint a sisterly kiss., "I can't sleep," continued Lucy, "while he watches yonder in the midst of enemies. Lean down close, and let me. tell you what shall be a secret to every body but the night and you." Lucy held open a small - ambrotype, and the tender light of the stars fell on the youthful face, with long hair and g gentle eyes, of a boy, perhaps fourteen. Ma- e rian's hand trembled till it nearly dropped the e picture, as she leaned over her companion. I  "t Wasn't he handsome then?" said Lucy. i- "Who would have thought the Knight of the Rocks ever looked so much like a poet i"   'The Knight of the Rocks!

N  As best she could, Lucy soothed the weep- lifel ing girl, pressing on her -all those endear- vitas inents of tone and touch which are foolish any in writing, but felt to be very noble and de- ed licious when actually received by a softened, ia afflicted mind.        -      ; Composure nwas not restored, tholugh, be- fore Lucy had been seriously alarmed.   to Marian's face gorew deadly pale; her whole ed framnle shivered, as. if the delicate structure fat would be shattered; and she pointed lliutely th to- her breast as the scat of the great pain m' which so convulsed her limbs, dried up her sh tears, and writhed her features.  I  1I am much better now," she said at ve t length, drawing a chair, and sitting- with one A - arm lovingly round Lucy's neck.      c   "You will rest on me alone, Marian, will lif you not?"                 in I  'I have no one else, friendl."

Where my moq ( thcr sleeps I do not know," commenced 1 A Marian, with a great effort to prevent the r tears, which would start from  her heart, fromn-being seen in her eyes. "I never knew ,:A, her love, and I can not remember her face. ( "l My first recollections are of my guar- dian, of one who called hmself my cousin, and the great city, New-Orleans. 'Mr.. Laroux, who at once taught me to call him father, was a wealthy mlerchant, and I had every thing but independence and a mother to make me happy. At times never was the sacred name, tenderness, duty, love e     /  '     of a fathler more grossly betrayed than by him. Arrain, the gentlest  nothler would have been cold comlpared with this lion-mnan. 9  The bitter poison-arrow of dependence was struck deep in my soul, and then its wound healed by the most womanly nursing. I would hardly begin to love and revere, cre the germ, thus struggling, was scorched by o somne fiercer Tebbad of harshness. Whether I would. iove laughel or wept at sighlt of his lifeless form, liinged on his last capricc. It was not intoxication: I never saw him touch any thing but the lightest wines. I wonder- ed if it were some defect of reason; yet no man was more punctual or successful in business. ' It seemed to me that I only represented to his mind some one else. WThen lhe look- e ed at me, whether witk the eyes of the e father or the tielr, I thought he looked ly through me at some other.   Perhlaps I in might have softened the tiger-glare if I 11had cr shown more of the lamb in my endurance of his hate. I was very gentle to his fondtness; at very rebellious against his rougher mood. ne A burning desire took possession of me to learn how he came to have power over my ill life and fate-who were mly parents. The indescribably terrible thought-perhaps I was an outcast, the unrecognized, fameless n vesult of his serpentry toward sonmec sweet eo1 innocent -would occur to me, continually n  occurlredl to me, has haunted me through long ds. weary yealrs of torturing suspense.

The words, 'last will   and testament,' caught my eye: I read a few lines, and was unable to cease till I read all. This writing wash unfinished, but contained endugh to reveal its conspiracy with my guardian and his nephew. I was left to the care of my cousin; the entire property of my guardian was given to him P and myself, provided we intermarried. This failing. ... - Ave Miaria! I could read no more; my eyes grew dim, I reeled and fell against a massive beaufet. Unconscious- ness, fever, delirium, prostrating sickness came on me; Death, cold senseless lover, flew from me. Nearly two gears passed. Mr. Laroux died suddenly of apoplexy. His will being opened, only'completed twhat I had 'seen. I was at the mercy-of one whom I felt, whether naturally or by the circumstances of his fate, unprincipled and unscrupulous. Such burning shame was mine, when his eye rested gldatingly on me. His coldness would have charmed me; his fondness hurt me worse than the hate of any other. I prayed that I might stand on some dizzy tower, and, with his first step toward me, throw myself headlong - into crushing safety from such degradation. His persecutions were unlinightly. He used my intense longing to know my own history, promising to reveal it as a reward for my compliance, threatening to withhold it-for- ever as a punishment of my firmness. I was tortured by the knowledge that here, within my grasp, lay the attainment of my great desire. I was stopped by this black gulf, from which my very skirts revolted. Then came the war. He was born, he told me in a foreign country. He obtained a commission in the United States Navy, and left me, closely watched by his emissaries, to return soon and make me mistress of a   war-ship. For a year I breathed free; Then New-Orleans was captured, and his hand planted the Federal flag over our house. I could not longer endure my terrible bondage, sold my jewels, converted a part of the money into a market-cart, and escaped to Mobile. Never shall I forget an Irishman who, being at hore sick of a wound received at'AManassas, assistedme in that escape. I wag the innocent, careless means of getting himn a situation once under Mr. Laroux, when he was a homeless sailor. Nobly did he repay my unthinking, girlish charity. Lucy, you can not do too much for Corporal O'Hara!" Lucy suppressed her surprise at this dis- closure, as the pensive woman went on. "By the most rigid economy, in perfect seclusion, I lived -for more than a year. Then my money was exhausted.   I had a fondness, but, Hthink, no genius, for the stage. I was very active, and-had been re- markable; at dancing-school. Through the South I went, a miserable, self-loathed,* ap- plauded ballet-girl. Oh! how I choked with the smiles that were necessary to ac- company my nimble feet! how hotly the foot-lights glared into my eyes! how stun- ning the applause which fell on my tingling ears! Sickness deprived me of this deathly means of living. Oh! how I thank God it has given me you! . Only keep me from the stage, Lucy! Save from that your desolate, unknown, unhappy Marian!" When the .high-priest sun flared up the dawn's golden incense on the "Altar of the East," his holy beams shone through the window-lattice on the two tear-stained faces of the girls, as they slept on Lucy's couch, folded in a close embrace.

OUR young friend Leopold, in whomn the G reader is expected to be very much inte- St rested, has been too long left to himself. fr During several days of this week he did very t severe duty. We will know why.       W The immense fleet of B. F. Butler, which B left Newport News one Thursday morning d in May, as the-boatswain of his flag-ship, the tc Greyhound, piped five bells, was intended, by the large-working brain of General Grant, g to overwhelm Petersburg, and throw such a, c force to the south and south-west of Rich- t niond that the gallant capital, with Beaure- t gard and Lee imprisoned in it, would fall an s easy prey to his strong, coacting pressure I from the North. This splendid plan, the invincible trio,  valor, gen'cralship, and Providence, being opposed to it, only added one other to the list of Federal failures.  Another wave dashed itself to moaning, withal blood- stained, foamrn against these tatterdemalion yet undaunted hearts. Tilhe Independent Signal Corps, placed along James River, in squads of ten and twelve men, fought -heroically against the companies and battalions-which, at nearly every station, were landed to destroy it, (it has been seen how disastrously the last attempt was repulsed by Wilton's scouts,) and, by incredible exertions, succeeded in getting news of the advance, to General Pickett in time for that officer to assemble a few hundred men in defense. The mouse-army sat down to burrow in front of Petersburg and Drury's Bluff. General Grant, still fighting on that tortuous line, reached Cold Harbor.  Here, behind the very works the Confederates had tra- versedl in pursuit of McClellan in 1862,   General Lee resisted his utmost desperation. Suddenly an entire corps was withdrawn from Petersburg, and sent down the James to unite,with Grant and crush Lee, now weakened by transfers of troops to Drury's Bluff. For hours the well-filled transports defiled by Wilton's eyrie, steaming, down toward. York River. Such information must be immediately given to Beauregard. Lee volunteered to carry it. .The sixty miles of road between their rendezvous and Petersburg was open to the enemy; but our courier accomplished it safely, rode all night, and at dawn signed his name to an accurate description he drew up at Beauregard's quarters of the 1oto and their probable number of tralnporteP troops. The neatly-dressed but .carc-worn, nervous - French soldier carefully examined his maps, talking aloud, but as if to himself; iimmedi- ately guessed the destination of this defl- ment; forwarded telegrams in quicli succes- I sion; issued orders to "feel the enemy" i along his entire line; and, suddenly recol- e lecting Lee, who stood hat in hand, keeping T as much composure as he could in presence t of one he so much admired, shook his hand t warmly, and courteously bowed hiln from ) the room.  n  In Petersburg, Lee obtained a letter, the Da first since his departure from Alice. It a inclosed one from Mariette, and the intelli- gence that in one month she and Dr, Hurt in would be married. But what was it made X the soldier's eyes sparkle so, and his heart as beat with quick pleasure? Ah!

"Now may God bless you, my darling Leopold, for your love and your letter sent me from Petersbulrg on your arrival there. "Oh! how I have longed for its sweet mes- sage, which I knew would be what I so much needed! Cclarinlo mio! there is no music since your instruments were made mute to us by your departure. -Aark's salute to the- spring, suggested by Heine's 'rUihings Griiss,' 'ling aUS wo die Veilclhen Spriis- sen," isn't a sweet burst of melody from the heart of a violet, when, for the first time, it opens its blue eyes to stare timidly round the wakincg world after the scowl of winter vanishes with his freezing rime. The pene- trating minor you make them! it haunts me, and is present in nearly all my dreams. "I clap my hands, Lee, because I tell her that I know you will read nly letter first, and I shall, therefore, be the first to tell you that Alariette will be happy in a month, almost as soon as you may receive this. Heaven rout the Yankees!  Perhaps you may not get this at all; perhaps it will be weeks or months before I hear from you again. How can I endure it? How can I write you what I should-comfort and cou- rage under any depression and discomfort? How can I entreat for you that confiding submission to His will which shall support you under any cross, while I myself am so full of selfish repining? "Are you well, not unpleasantly situated, not hungry always, and not too much en- dangered? Write me answfers to these questions and a thousand others I would ask. "Can it be that this is the first letter I have ever written you? Is it possible that our love-the growth of our youth, our childhood, almnost of our babyhood-finds its earliest expression in your note wnd- and-this poor reply?  Well, first letters should not be too bold; they should tanta- lize just a little, queridito mio!   "My loving regards to Lieutenant MSark. As for thyself, the dearest, tenderest, truest! I love, and cherish, and pray for thee; crown thee with all caresses and tender sympathies, all the devotion and entire trust that one human soul can call from the heart of your -           ALLIE." Lee's delight in the sincere, simple, un- doubting love of this letter was not unalloyed by a feeling of a different nature. Memory- Fairy Puck of the mind--instantly and with fairy-like deviltry recalled a sad, strange face from whose blue eyes his gentle reason- ing, chased the tears one soft evening not long ago. It occurred to him that he did not altogether perfectly deserve that warm outhurst which the unknowing heart of Alice had not been able to restrain. For three days past, she, who had been thinking of him all the time with the fondness of her inlpulsive, girlish soul, had hardly been .re- membered.  True, the end and dangerous character of his courier-ride had necessarily engrossed much of his attention. Still, he felt that he was in arrears with his sweet- heart; and his affection struggled to decide whether to be, in the smallest degree, in- creased or diminished by the realization that her devotion had surpassed his own. The reproach of that moonlight affair was not so easily disposed of. Buvit he thought, after much self-recrimination, perhaps it's all as unreal and grotesque as the moonlight itself. He hadn't thrown an arm round the girl's waist, or imprinted any memorial of his folly on her cheek, or said any thing, may be, which a gallant was not called on to -say in such constancy-trying circum- stances. It might be that Miss Marian Wills not only would not give her smallest needle for more than his friendly regard, but heart- ily regretted the turn to which her acute sensibility, her intensely spirituelle nature, roused by the fall of that melting music on some secret spring of grief, had unavoidably led. I have no doubt-Wras his concluding reflection-that she will be very grateful to me if I show my appreciation of her delicate structure by seeming to have forgotten the whole affair. If this thought did not satisfy his rigid mental arraigner, he resolved to assist it as   much as possible. He therefore first spurred his horse to a run over a half-mile of nearly level road lying in front, and then, subsiding to a slower pace, began, with a small bottle   of brandy and a lunch given him in Peters. burg, to beguile the remainder of his journey to the river.   CHAPTER XIII.

HE WISELY LEAVES THE PRAISING( OF HS BOSOM FRIEND, MARK WILTON S POETRY, TO THE LIPS OF IIIS BOSOM FRIEND, MSS LUCY PEGRABM.   THS week was a-verv long one to Lieu-  tenant Wilton. Redoubled vigilance was ne- cessary in the care of his station, because it was impossible to Snow positively in what direction the corps of Baldy Smith would aim its blow. Every day he expected that he might be swept fromnt his warder's tower - in the way O'Hara had pleasantly hinted sometime before, that is, by the bullets of forty thousand men.  If this detachment meant to carry Weldon, and actually pene- trated toward Raleigh, farewell to all further news from home! Outrages on the part of suddenly freed negroes and abandoned Fede- rals became more and more frequent. Fears for the safety of good General Pegram's household, united with the distressing mys- tery in the character of Miss Lucy, and the strange falling off which followed in his rela- tion with his brother, to make him restless and unhappy. -Longing for action, he almost resolved to take no precautions, as one, feel- ing himself already entangled in his doom, determines to make no vain struggles, but *to meet his noble fate with manhood. His good sense having dissipated this mist of desperation, he moved his camp about a mile further up the river; it was unsafe to ;keep it in one place longer than a few days. Those who have never felt the nobility and dignity of an earnest, fraternal affec- tion can not understand the suffering which Wilton experienced in this slight, hardly to himtnself rational, estrangement from his brother. In his secret thought he wished that Lee -had been somewhere else instead of prowling. . ..    "God forgive me this folly!" ended his vexation, and tipped his petulance with a prayer. He inly vowed to crush at once the fear thus sprouting in his heart, to smooth away at   any sacrifice the clouds threatening to drench with sleet the garden of his family affection. It was impossible to keep entirely away from Castlewood. What reasonable reason could be assigned for doing so? The temp- tation to hear again that,delicious music asserted its sway. Why should he deprive. himself of that pleasant society fortune had so carelessly thrown in his way? One of the evenings during Lee's absence he spent among his friends; slept beside his saddled horse in the woods deeming it un- safe to remain all night in the house; and was unexpectedly delighted the next mornK ing to meet Lucy and Marian, who had armed themselves with a flask of liquor and a small pistol, and ridden forth to find him. He took both weapons, and made them smile by pledging them in one, and vowing, with mock chivalry, to defend them against all fierce poultry and bellicose swine with the other. After breakfast Marian withdrew to her young charges, and Wilton was left alone with Lucy. He understood German toler- ably well, and translated for her some of the beautiful poems her old library furnished in the original. Schiller's "Des BMadchen's Klage," Heine's "Du bist wie eine Blume," and S Die Nahe des Geliebten " of Goethe were rapturously applauded by his fair auditor. As he now and then glanced from the zig- zag characters of the German text to the fair soul he thought was expressed in Miss Pegrain's beaming eyes, he mentally re- marked that it would be the nlost sacrile- gious vandalism to think any thing harsh of one so full of enthusiasm, and so earnest in her expressions of poetic appreciation.   How quickly love weaves its gossamer ner * web over all ugliness, and how stronger than we steel are its fairy-like, silken envelopments on "Did you eV r   poetry, Miss Lucy?"Pe iOf course'have, sir What young  , lady th of sixteen has not?"            e "Let me see some of it," asked Wilton, with a smile.                of "Ah  ' it was so exquisitely fine it went M, right up to heaven; couldn't stay on the ra earth, it was so ethereal."

Lee rwas Ibeginning to introduce him -to hMi;s iarian,! when, to his surprise, O'Hara advanced readily with extended hand, and the tutoress, not without somne emnbarrass- ment, greeted him as an- old friend. They arranged t1henselves on the seats- Mark at the helm, and, with the aid of his chief mnate, Miss Lucy, managing the after- sheet; Lee amnidshipi, as sailing master for the foremnast; and O'Hara, captain of the forecastle. Marian sat in the bow, to watch the water split away on each side of the sharp keel. She called herself their only steerage pas- senger. "Not so," quickly anmeded Lee. "Our bright lookout." A light breeze bore them slowly on the starthoard. tack, straight out across the water, for some distance, and then "about ship," back along the line of curling foam. As Lee looked at the smiling face of Lucy Pegram, heard the alrtless, unaffected tone of her voice, gentle as the ripple of the water, saw the perfectly satisfied enjoyment   which beamed in every action, le doubted the evidence of his own recollectinn almost, and lost hiimself in guesses of what motiv's could have prompted her singular ride ijn the moonlight. "A good many years ago," she- said, "( all this restless water iwas frozen over hard, arid father crossed it on horseback. He says he had flirted with half the pretty young la- dlies of Castlewood Hundredls, and was going over to lay earnest siege to mlothcr's affec- tion." ' The old fellow's heart is big enough to give them all a portion, and still retain a wide corner for the last one," returned Lee, 'smling r . What a sintimint for an unmarried, jovial young spalpeen to utter in the face of twco of the dear creatures!" exclaimed O'Hara, tugging at the fluttering jib-sheet, in obedience to Marl;'s colmand to "Let draw! taut! make fast there, forward " O'Hara's brogue was usually very broad and apparent, but sometimes he could, sin- gularly, talk with almost perfect freedom from it. 'l'o those who heard him in his more frequent moods-the brogue mnoods- it sounded comically to hear him boast his innocence of murdering the-Queen's English, and to see him gravely lay his hand across his breast, bow with the most accomplished grace, and whisper, "Monsieur O'Hara, s'il vous plait!' "T I humbly beg pardon, thou Pyramus for constancy V" answered Lee to the corporal's charge, But the bow 'which accompanied his words was seriously interfered with by a careen -of the boat, as she again headed toward the " wind's eye," and leaned over until her gunnel nearly touched the restless element on which she sailed. He had to   scramble a little to keep from going over-  board, and the young ladies uttelred a stream of suspensive shirieks and gay laughters. 'There is far too little devotion. of the Pyramus and Thisbe quality in this open- eyed age of the practical," said Aalrk, when they were once more quietly and smoothly going aheald. "I wish there was something in tihese times to incite us even to droll representa- tions of tis sort. Our bleeding country is the very reverse of fairy-land!" sighed Miss Lucy. "It should be the birthiplace of heroes,k returned Lee. "And devotion belongs-" ' Arrah! it is of heroines, though they are not all of the Marquis of Waterford stamp," broke in O'Hara, looking straight at MaLrian. She had been idly watching the flighteof Ia wind-hover that floated slowly in the air just above the brine, ever and anon wtetting its plume in the waves which seemed to leap to its embra ce. She looked mp, heaving tire corpuoral's compliment to Southern womlen. A liquid sparkle shone from her eyes as she smiled gratefully back to himn, and re- turned:               - - "Yes, a more delicate stamp, but as true. Yet I can not agree with you, if you echo the, lament of Aurora Lcigh to the detriment of Southern menC , "The world's male chivalry has perished out, while wnomen- are knighta-errant to the last,' etc." "The English Florentine wrote that," re- plied Lee, "before secession came to show what heroism was in American souls." "'Before that Italian night," continued Lucy, "l when the spirit of Rornney Leigh grew bright, oh! so heroically bright, with the darkening of his eyes." / "Ready about! ease off! catch her in time 5 catch her in time, corp'l! lot draw 1" Wilton was a good sailor, and his seamen were skillful. The little ship, now nearly half a mile from shore, halting a momient to wear round, once more took wing and stood aTway on the leeward board. i With such unanirnity, it is impossible to getup a discussion," said Mark. "Weshould have our wounded prisoner here. He might at least dispute the palm by -claiming as much for Northern nobility as we accord   to the chivalry of the cotton and tobacco States,." Lee rejoined, "t Of course he would claim it, but how unjustly, three years of war have shown." "They may have proved that to 3ryoll, old fellow!! And they have writen their testi- mony, in characters of blood. The question is, what is the deciphering of thesc hiero- glyphics to the eye of the world? Perhaps our enemies would fight better and lhrider, if they did not have to struggle also with their affection. They have professed to love us." "Ay! and they have defamed us; they havre made printing, the tongue of the world's intelligence, utter the basest fabri- cations about us; The South was repre- sented to be a pandemnonium, in which cruelty held devilish sway; Southern; wo- nanhood was turned into a gloating Com- mKaLs,  reveling, in the anguish of -our slaves, when the lash drove its fangs into quivering black-forms." "But, my dear boy, you are n  charging recklessly upon the whole North the SiiS that belong only to a few."  Then' why did the many assist the few in their devilish scheme? We tried Su- preme Court decisions; they gave us the right, but no clredress. Wec implored peace- ful separation; they would not listen to our entreaties. We were forced to appeal our cause to a highcer tribunal. The ensan- guined fields of Vigilnlia have become the court; the briefs are ordinances of separa- tion, and proclamations of freedom on one side to blacks, on the other, to whites; the arguments are now canllon-balls; the jurors, timne, courage, fortitude; the arbiter, God. It was but the rupture, after wrarning given, of a treaty, the dissolution of an onerous copartnership, an assertion of right which had never been yielded." "I will admit that the attitude of the nation is not noble. But individual acts of heroism have been remnarkably frequent among them, consideringr the enevation of trade apd prosperity. The wise me at the North saw disunion as the death C national greatness, a lie to the assertion od e peo- ple's fitness for self-gotvernment. The good mlln resolved that it might be better to   scourge the South than to- sacrifice the na- tion. They said, discarding the rhapsodies of fanatics about the sin which should drag us to the bottomless pit, the South is our unworthy brother; he has violated our family peace, yet our love cart not spare him to go 'from us." "Bitter love!" echoed Lee. "I can not understand the love which kills, rots in pri- son-vaults, hangs in public squares, starves, despoliates, violates, degrades; which is cruel and ungenerous; which will listen to no prayers, will have annihilation or submis- sion, is Nero-like, blind, and heartless. God saves us from this love! How a woman's heart will take things to itself and adopt them! 'Marian could not for her life have helped exclaiming with vc- hemence, "L God save us from this love!" Lucy understood her well, and, looking at her ever so tenderly, called out, "I wish I could get to you, Marian, to kiss you." Marian kissed her hand to her firiend, and she alone heard the muttered oath with which O'Hara cursed somebody, it is not hard for some of us to guess whom! During a boat-sail it-is hard to keep up a continuous conversation. All talk was now suspended, while the necessary orders were given and executed, and the boat put square about for the starting-place. Along this part of James river there are numerous wharves, built out from one to five hundred yards above the water, and used before the war in the trade with Norfolk and Richmond. These were all fired in 1862, and nearly consumed. Along one of them they were now sailing, at the rate of five or six knots. The ends of large trees, driven as piles here and there, showed charred, blackened stumps about the waves, and gave resting- places for the sea-birds that occasionally visit- ed the stormy bay. Wilton saw the end of the wharf, and, allowing for leeway, wished to show his skill to the old sailor O'Hara by the ease with which he would pass it. His calcu- lations were perfect, but seriously went "aglee." As t1iy neared the wharf, he saw, almost with a feeling of horror, a black spot of water just under the lee-bow. He knew in the   instant what it was, the top of a burnt pile submerged by the tide. He was very cool and uttered no cry of alarm, only, "Steady, all, and hold fast!" Should he ease off and run to starboard? There was not room between the submerged pile and the wharf, partially destroyed. Should he attempt to put about? There was not time. If the wind freshened, he could throw her head closer to it and slip to windward. There was no change, ZEolus heeded not the prayer thus express- ed only by being felt, uttered only by the spirit of his calculations. There was time for nothing Put for these thoughts to flit through his mind with that lightning rapidity with which mind sends its messages. There was roonm for but one course -im-  mediately to luff her up in the wind, and so impede her motion that the concussion would be comparatively easy. Nobly he performed his part; but, alas! at the in- stant his helm went hard over, the thole- pin round which the after-sheet was secured suddenly gave way. -There was no sail -to catch the wind and bear round the stern. She struck with a'sharp, gliding sound, slid over the pile, and went on, though With much abated speed. Marian was thrown headlong from her careless position in the bow, and sank be- neath the white wake of the rushing ship. At the same time, Lee and O'Hara leaped to assist her. Lucy had fallen, swooning, in the bottom, of the boat. Mark had no chance to display any he- roism, except (perhaps his was the greatest, after alD in restraiining himself friom recover- ing his fainting sweetheart instead of turn- ing his attention first to his craft, upon getting which under control he knew evelry thing now depended. The rudder was carried away by the shock. Fortunately the jib and fore-sheets (these should have been released at the mo- ment the helm went over) were secured in seamanly fashiion, one jerk undid each, and the vessel's motion was checked. The sails were loosely brailed, and he was soon sculling back to the place where the   forms of Lee and O'Hara were battling with the waves. O'Hara's cry to Lee, as both dove together, still rang in his ears, Ad Back, sir! back to the boat!  I'll save Marian Laroux, or go down too." The brave Irishman was very unfortunate. In his second plunge, his head struok another pile as he descended, and his nearly lifeless body rose to the surface. Mark was barely in -time to rescue the selfsh-generous res- cuer. Lee came up a second time, wildly shook the water from his long hair, exclaiming piteously, "My God, I can not find her!" and again descended. There are moments of suspense wMhich cleave time before our souls, as internal throes split the quaking earth before- our feet. Any Curtius-sacrifice is as impotent to close the time-chasm, as it has been, since the days of Rome, to save Lisbon and other victims of the sickl planet.   Passionate prayers went up. from the tiny shallop that floated on this waterdrop, to the infinite Neptune who balances the seas upon his palm. Heaven guided, now, Lee's almost blind graspings beneath the water, and he at last appeared, swimming painfully with his fair burden. All were out of inmcmediate danger; but a huge crevice had been opened in the vessel's bottom, and the boys stood in several inches of water, when Marian and Lucy, by the help of some brandy brought in the luncheon- baskets were restored to consciousness. Lucy and Lcopold began to bail vigorous- ly with caps and baskets, and Mark and O'Hara hurriedly pulled their lusty oars. It was not long ere they had the intense pleasure of placing Marian on a couch of grass and shawls, where she might perfectly recover her breath and compose Iher nerves.    , .   CHAPTER  XV. SOMETHNG FOUND AND SOMEBODY'S SKIRTS PARTIALLY CLEARED OF A STAIN.   SEVERAL days passed quietly after the ad- venture related in the last chapter. As soon as they arrived at Castlewood and had taken off their wet garments, Lucy and Marian threw themselves on their knees and thanked God for his vouchsafed pro- tection. Marian seemed as well as usual, and com- menced with the next sunrise the custom- ary tutorial duties. Mark and Lee came up, now, nearly every day, one in the morning, the other in the evening. The members of the little party were getting necessary to each other's hap- piness. O'Hara was not forgotten, and, if he did not come also, a nice basket of eat- ables and drinkables was dispatched to him. It was a gallant sight to see the corporal charge one of these small Bristow. Sta- tions." His mess was deployed so as to completely environ the devoted fortress: he waved his jack-knife in glittering circles about his head, sounded a vocal bugle- charge, and " at 'em" went his unflinching followers. An abatis of biscuit and broiled chicken was quickly thrown down; through a moat of brandy, and up over huge breast- works of Smithfield ham and light bread, they clambered, unfaltering, undaunted, and un- broken. Scores of crisply fried sausages fell in the unequal combat; red sorghum ensanguined the field, the weapons, and the mouths of the combatants; the vapor of a steaming kettle of sassafras tea rose in musky clouds, shadowing the scene;-and the shouts of the victors mixed, in dreadful exultation, with the clatter of the drummers beating a pean of victory on their tin-plates. The last act of the melodrama beggars all description, when the now thoroughly arous- ed, still unsated veterans made the final as- sault upon a huge iced pound-cake they had not hitherto been able to pierce.   Onwrard in your harmless charge, heroes of more mortal conflicts! Your faces bronzed with the suns of summer campaigns, your uniforms dingy with weary marches, there are few of ye left to unite with your old com- rade in this bitter smile; to read this parody on the wild light that blazed from your eyes, and the fierce joy that burst from your thirsty throats, when your weapons were bayonets-your enemies, the invaders of noble Virginia I Wilton and Miss Lucy were, beyond mea- sure, happy. The souls of two who wor- ship music and love are infinite and inex- hauStible, the richest mines of enjoyment. Only once the dream  of an angel whose robes were soiled- and unworthy her angel- ship harassed his rest, and recalled his single, nearly forgotten source of discontent. Poor Maarian I Alone unhappy!  How sacred is the torture with which a woman crushes back into her heart its growing love for one who, if he knew, could stretch out his hand and grasp what he will not sue for 1 How her maidenly instinct battles-with her tenderness; how fearfully she treads, lest by some unguarded step, a word, a smile, she release the sweet prisoner, which, while it is confined, is holy; if it should escape, would tear to shreds the vail of her womanly deli- cacy  Strange working of the All-Wise, that the 4Subtle ether of love may, by such slight transition, pass from  healthful elixir to r pas-like poison!  Lee entertained the tenderest regard- for the lowly yet high-minded Marian, while he continued faithfully to worship the votive I wreath hung up in his heart's temple, and consecrated to the absent Alice. He lavish- ed the attention of a dear friend on Marian, because he esteemed her gentleness, intelli- gence, and undaunted devotion to the path   she had chosen.  But she was not for a moment deceived, and shuddered at his gen- tleness, as the gold-balance trembles with the light ring of the counterfeit. Lucy did not reveal-to her parents what Marian had imparted to her, but she told enough to in- crease, if possible, the nearly maternal inte- rest Mrs. Pegram already evinced. One day Marian was forced to desert her pupils on account of a high fever which made her too - dizzy to sit up. About midnight Lucy rose to see if she slept. She found her mother sitting by the bedside, and gently stroking the pale hand she held. An infant could not receive a tenderer touch. Lucy kissed sleeper andwatcher, and retired. The next morn- ing Marian declared she was well, and would listen to no entreaty to take another day of rest. 'No!" she said, " to-morrow is Friday, and then I'll have Saturday and Sunday." This Saturday night was an eventful one to Lee. It was not Wilton's custom to keep sen- tries round the tents. His force was not large enough, and' the picket-posts on the beach and road were deemed sufficient and more effectual in preventing a surprise. It is already related h6v enamored Lee was of moonlight.  Hiis letter from Alice Landon  had  in nowise diminished  this tendency to the restless and romantic. As   he strolled along the indistinct path Mark had followed in search of the footsteps he dreaded to find, Lee thought he heard the sound of hoofs. He dismissed the fancy im- mediately as the tide rolled up its full boom and receded with a wordless wail, (albeit the sea should be many-tongued, touching so many coasts;) but he was not mistaken in that arrow-full quiver of light which just then flashed in his eyes from the ground a few paces ahead! "That is a brilliant glow-worm," he thought, and smiled as he reflected. "But glow-worms love stars, not moonlight. Dian is too jealous to admit such a rival. Alde- baran hardly dares show his pale face to- night." He stooped where he had seen the glittering object. His hand closed on a gold trinket, a neat breast-pin enamel, on whoso back surface lay a golden grape-clustcr. At the back-there was enough light, but little need for him to-read the words engraved there-Marian Laroux. Lee was overjoyed, while yet a dread mystery perplexed him. The next morning he would seize a favorable opportunity, grasp his brother's hand, and shake it warmly as he whispered, 'It was not Miss Lucy, Mark, but the tutoress." Marlk would be troubled a moment; then realize it all, and the estranged hearts be as close and loving as before.   CHAPTER XVI. SOMETHNG LOST: AND THE AUTHOR SHOWS HMSELF AN HONEST NOVELIST BY GIVING THE READER TOO LARGE A GLIMPSE, PERHAPS, OF HS SECRET.   MARIAN was wholly unaware of her loss until she was half-way back to Castlewood. Then something fluttering about her throat, her loosened collar, arrested her attention. It is useless to describe that dread feeling which afflicts us when we first miss the pos- session of something much valued. Marian sought the missing trinket in her girdle, in all the folds of ler dress, and in her bosom; rode back a half-mile, and, reluctantly realiz- ing the futility of a search at this time, re- traced her steps in the home direction. lHer disappointment was very bitter.- A similar pin could be purchased for one half her monthly earning, it may be; but this one was invaluable. No living friend, whatever his excellences, can replace the one that "hath gone before." In one of his kindest days her fitful-tem- pered guardian had pinned this upon her breast., The last link binding her to him, through him to the truth of her birth and parentage, (never would she accept the ter- rible condition of her cousin,) was gone, gone; and she was left a lone, parentless, dependent woman; one whose present ac- tion even, if discovered, might bring on her shame, disgrace, dismissal, forfeiture of the love of those whose affection now was the sole comfort of her life. For how could she explain it? Would her strength allow her to go over again the horrible details of her unhappy life? She felt that she could die, publishing to any other than Lucy that she was, what she trembled to think, one who, by some bitter fault which society entails upon the children of the tempted, could claim no name; dead in a more terrible way than the nun is dead, when she throws the flowers of earthly joy behind her, lowers the vail to the sunlight of maternal happiness, and, amidst the booming of the salute-gun,   enters the cloistered tomb. And perhaps he might die. who of all the world could speak the word that would give her new life or knell her death. Would she be credited if she told that this was why she rode through suspicion and the night toward his cotich of wounds and pain? The violence of her emotions almost crazed her brain, and, with a singular inconsistency of her nature, she smiled as she resolved to torture herself no more then with these reflections. - Strange situation of one possessing the delicacy of iMarian Laroux! .But consider, of what are not some women capable! Courageous O'Hara would have felt very lonely and uneasy, riding twenty miles at night through a country which might at any moment swarm with enemies; the te-rors of the situation were easily triumphed over by Marian, because something more than duty ow fame lay before her. All the timidity of feminine nature is, in anticipation: in action- its brain is cool- its frame nerved, and its conclusions quick as lightning. A moment more, the woman is reasserted: she faints in the arms of success., Some god waits on her steps, hedging her oftenest with a shrinking dependence , at- the right time, clothing her with impenetra- ble mail, and arming her soft hand with the sword of Boadicea. Marian was startled, perhaps, by every unusual sight and sound; but she was sup- ported by the consciousness of her Own rec- titude, and by the fervent prayers she sent up to the "Man of Sorrows." She had never revealed to Lucyl the secret of her midnight equestrianism. It was easy to steal softly through her room,. get the accoutrements and the stable-key, saddle the gentle Nelly, and away! A little caution replaced, unobserved,   these things in their place, and her own weary form in bed. A headache the next morning and some twinges of her fearful pain were subdued while she plodded through primary text-books with her pupils. -Now she had failed twice; twice Lee's steps had alarmed her, and she--had been compelled to return home, baffled and de- spairing. Suddenly she checked her horse: "Suppose I throw myself on the con- fidence of Leoppold Wilton; having won him, prostrate. myself before this pain-softened man, and appeal to that little spark of kind- ness which must remain to every one, how- ever foully the dank ashes adhere about it. No! no! no!  -Prostration before either would liill me. Alone! I must see him in secret and alone, or I shall die!" The half-uttered mournful thought became almost a wail, and mingled itself with the strange sound of the tide, which, as it undu- lated domwn the beach, seemed in the inoon- light like an embattled line of scaly dragons beat back from holy walls. Leaving the shore, Marian began to tra- verse the last few miles of her journey. She had approached close to astlewood, pursu- ing a path known only to the immediate neighbors of that farm, .then a confused sound assailed her ear, and a considerable glare met her eye, rising above the trees in front. "Castlenwood on fire!" The saime fear seemed to fill the breast of Nelly, so fast sheleaped across the patches of nloon- light and shade along the narrow bridlc- road. No! As she passed through the back gate, all was right about the-house, except that lights glanced through that portion of it she knew had not been occupied for a long time. "They are searching for me, perhaps!" Putting away her horse, she crept to the kitchen, met a female servant, and obtained assistance in replacing the equipments.   "Lor! Mi8s  Marian! how thoughtfl  of you to try and save Miss Lucy's saddle, too I What was she thinking of to leave it in de stable dis evenin'r!  Mussy! I What's dis? Your ridin' dress?' I "Hush, Emily I Have they been'looking for me?" (Lookin' for you? No, ma'am; but you beat de time! Jest think of you a tryin' to take Miss Lucy's horse to de woods! Poor Marster I she's all he'll have now to make dis crop, and Nelly's a mighty poor 'pend- ence in de field." So the girl went on, and Marian knew the whole matter as a figure in bluceuniformn passed across the library window.  Tlhe sentry, Emily told her, was only at the front- door, and she easily made her way, unmo lested, to Lucy's roolm. Lucy's trembling lips imparted the news- that the Yanikees thien in the house were the officers of a large squad of cavalry, (Mariian had seen its watch-fires;) that Lucy had been caught in the librarly;  had at- tempted to make her escape by a passage leading round through the utnuscedl lpart of the building, and had arrived, at the door going into her own r1oom, only to find it locked within; had crept back to the library door,- and ovelrhearcd a constultation of tile commander and his subordinates%.., They had then gone to supper, and she Ilhad just slipped back to the safety of her own boudoir. "Marian, how can we save, themn? At daylight they'll be surprised, capturc , nmur- dered!" Lucy thrcw herself on her bedl, anlost swooning with suspensc. .As the notes of the bugle and the shouts of the railders sounding "to horse!" smote on her gar, she sank into unconsciousness.  .'^   CHAPTER XVII. K., HENRY.-Gloster, 'tis true that we are in great danger; The greater, therefore, should our courage be. CONS.-They have said their prayers, and. they stay for death." KIing Hewy V.   IT was nearly dawn when the dreams of a TWilton's camp were interrupted by an alarm. e The Federal -troop charged his picket post E in the gray morning, and almost annihilated a it; then, having rushed down the main 1 road to the river and found no enemy, threw out skirmishers and waited in line for more a light.                  1 Fortunate was their last removal of camp I for the Confederates!  Otherwise they i would have been without notice, other than the heavy sabres and 'trampling hoofs of  their enemies. As it was, one of the three,  pickets escaped to rouse his comrades; they 1 had timue to saddle up, and soon showed their intentions by, in turn, driving back the enemy's outmost guards. Many advantages rest with those who fight in a country whose intricacies they are well acquainted with. Wilton dismounted his party, ordered three men to hold the horses of the rest, and selected a tree or some natural defense for each. Twenty paces -of thinly brushed undergrowth extended in front of his posi- tion, and then opened into the level road oc- cupied by the Yankees. O'Hara and five mounted men protected one flank, the river bluff more effectually guarded the other. It was foolish bravery to make a fight against such odds, -but his men applauded their leader's determination. The Federals also dismounted, deployed half their force in a thick line of skirmishers, and-advanced in a fast walk. They were very close; their wings began to close like a fan; they received the order to "Charge! Double quick!" At this moment Mark's command gave them its tumultuous fire of rifles, pistols,   and shot-guns.  From  every tree, from every stumnp,' came a bullet and a cheer; some of the Rebels shouted, Brillng up that artillery!" "Rally by platoons!" "Bat- talion,' etc. The Federals began to waver, and scatter, and halt; and finally, ignorant of what num- bers they were assailing, receiving but not returning a murderous fire, they turned and fell back precipitately. Twice the charge was repeated similarly, except that instead of. advancing in silence they loaded and fired, rapidly as they came on. Similar repulses sent them back bro- ken and disheartened. In this interval of rest and gratulation, Lee, seeing three of his comrades bleed- ing on the ground, suddenly recollected their wounded prisoner. They had not had time to remove him, even to give him a sup- ply of water, which he needed continually. Their camp was just behind the line of battle. Lee ran back to it, seized a bucket of water, drank deeply, and carried it in to the patient. Inquiring how he was, he got no reply, and went up to his side. EHe started back in horrified surprise. The life- less body of the unfortunate man hung over his couch; his hair was filled with blood, t and one of his hands seemed with terrible I playfulness to have dabbled in a Pool of gore on the ground. I  A shot, from the- Federal s most probably, had entered the brain, and driven thence his life. I  A large folded paper, fastened with black r ribbon, and lying partially in the red liquid that stained the ground, attracted Lee's at- e tention; heplaced it in his pocket and re- , turned to his post.   Fiercely the skirmish went on. The Federals did not charge again at once, but, keeping up i steady fire in front, sent out a flanking party. Lee was dispatched by Marlk to find out something of O'Iara; he found only one of his men. The brave fellow had charged with his small squad the half-company that opposed him. "Four of the boys fell at the first volley. Corp'l and I got through just by the rush of our horses. Any chance to get back to camp with my horse?" Lee gave him directions, and continued   his search for O'i-Iara. He' wasndered an hour, dodging  innumerable dan-g r  at length found a stray horse, and, conceiv- ing the idea that assistance might be ob- tAined to capture the party of the enemy, rode toward Ivor Station. The Yankee force closed, like the net of a fowler, on Wilton's devoted band.;- . His entire command, as soon as he was prostrated by a wound in the side, was taken captive. The Federals were jovially rampant in the little camp of our heroes.   CHAPTER XVIIT. TO ANOTHER, MEDUSA SHAKES -HER GORY LOCKS.   IT is impossible to describe the grief of the inmates of Castlewood when they learn- ed the result of the skirmish. The victors themselves were the only source of informa- tion. Through them, several days after- wardthey found out that Mark was severe- ly wounded and sent down the river; that Lee and O'Hara had escaped, or, at least, were not yet captured. They listened with pain to the glorification of the officers who quartered on them over their success in breaking up this notorious guerrilla-den-so they chose to style Wilton's encampment. Lucy's sleep was restless with visions of a gibbet and a beloved form dangling from it. The flush of health abandoned her cheek, and her dark eyes grew lustrous with the sorrow that gnawed at her heart. The country being filled with parties of Federal cavalry passing between Norfolk and Suf- folk, the girls hardly dared to stir from the yard. One evening they walked to the church, half a mile from the house. The sun was sinking when they crossed the stile and went up the broken steps. The enemy had respected the temple of God. Nothing was disturbed within. The very subscription plates of wood, inlaid with silver, were not removed from their resting-place on the cushioned top of the railing round the altar. Lucy sat down to the small organ she was accustomed to play every Sunday, and breathed out the mournfulness of her spirit in the wailing notes of a voluntary. Once Mark had stood -by her hero, and had lov- ingly pressed her fingers, after they ceased to move over the keys, in token of his deep appreciation of what she wanted the music to speak to him. Now he was imprisoned, sick, perhaps dying! She bowed her head upon the instrument to weep.   Marian's suffering exceeded, if possible, that of her friend. "LovUin eyes in eyes beloved Are swift to search out secrets." Looking through the fraternal tenderness of Lee, NMarian saw that she had not- his heart; she was not, therefore, privileged to mourn his absence. Sorrow was not new to her; it had written its sad story in'her spirit and on her brow. - It forbore to ravage further her delicate frame. Bitter, bitter is the smile when the heart is scorched! To have to jest when the soul is anguished, to still the roar of that inner baAle with light words of every-day greet- ing: it is worse than physical torture. The  rack of the Inquisition lacerates the flesh: this is a rack to the soul. Marian seldom yielded to tears now; their sources were dried by the intensity and habit of pain. Remembering how Lucy had com- forted her one night before, she strove to return that kindness. As the last smile of the dying day stream- ed- through the stained windows and filled the "long-drawn aisle" with multi-hued light, Lucy dried her tears, the organ and church-doors were closed, and they started home. "Who is dead, Marian?" "Our hope, Lucy.') "I did not mean that," returned the first, pressing her companion's hand. "Yonder is a fresh grave. ' Have you heard of any affliction among the neighbors?" They drew near the new-heaped mound. The summer twilight deepened into night,' and the low chirp of insects alone broke, without disturbing, the stillness. The odor- ous bloom of honeysuckle and eglantine relieved the gloominess of the ivy that hung about the dank wall.

REVERENCE TO THE IMMORTAL DEAD t   "GGRACIOuS alive! What is this I 'see before me'? 'Come, let me clutch thee I I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. ' And on thin blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood!' By Jove! old fellow! But that last charge beat Balaklava! How'n the deuce did you expect to get five men through thirty? It's like trying to run a bushel of dead-eyes and gripes through a 1ing-bolt. How'd you get here? Wthere've you been all this time? An't you a ghost? You're pale and thin as one 1" L Chiruel spalpeen!" came in answer from a mouth belonging to the devoted head on which this rain of quotations and interroga- tories had descended. - "Are there anny sparits about here?"' The speaker lifted his feet wearily, draggingly7 three times, gained a lamp-post on the corner of Sycamore and Bolinghroke streets, and leaned against it for support that seemed absolutely neces- sary to him. "An't this the spirit of Corporal O'Hara that I do now address? And being so un- like a spirit of health, is it not a goblin damned? Do I not see the marks of the devils upon yote Wyour jacket torn with their claws? your face cindered with their brimstone?" "Ach i not them sort of spirits, man; but them that inter in a feltow and comfort 'im, whan he's tired and hungry," answered the lamp-post. "Poor corporal! Come on! I'll fix you up. 'Nherw! you hear that?" as a shell hurtled through the air, like a flight of fallen angels. "That's devilish unspiritual and uncomfortable; struck down about the de- pot, I reckon. Let's get away from here, O'Hara. They burst 'em right in the libra- ry hall here sometimes, and explode many a literary and philosophical theory for us.   This way!" Lee drew his weary comrades' right arm round his neck, embraced and supported him with his own left, and, faint- ly after the manner of Aineas bearing Father Anchises through toppling Troy, assisted him up the main street of Petersburg, along deserted store-rooms, pavements torn with shells, and debris of every description. "I thought I'd have luck finding Something to drink to-day," continued Lee, " we distilled so many spirits out of 'em last night at the Reservoir lines. It got so hot, we signalers left the station and went in as infantry. General Mahon told me never to do it again, though.- You see,.corporal, I'm acting ser- geant, now, and ex-officio aid-de-caimp. The general said to me this morning, 'Look here, Mr. Signalman, that's the way to get your men killed too soon. That won't do. I want this message to go to General Lee right away. Cyrus W. Field, a anvilitaire! don't battle with the elements.' Your humble servant's goin' to stick to his bomb-proof from this time forward. Here's the place; I struck this paradise the moment I got in town." Lee pushed hard against a heavy oaken door which yielded with much reluc- tance, and entered a long room like a tobac- co store, and occupied with one or two smokers. He took a letter from his pocket, remarking to his comrade, "Just got it to- day, with money," transferred fifteen dol- lars from its loving folds to the man behind the counter, and received two cigars. O'Hara was, physically, nearly dead; for no mental condition would ever have dejected him as his fatigue did. . He followed Lee's movements with his eyes in mute astonish- ment. Lee again half-shouldered hin, talk- ing cheerily, "This is the way we put smoke in the eyes of the authorities," helped him to the end of the long room arid up a lofty flight of steps.   Dear reader, if it's a hot June day when you read this, order an iced beverage of some description; from its jingle and sparkle, and generous refreshment, you will understand the sight and sound which greeted O'Hara now in a better way than I could possibly hope to describe to you. -"Here?, Orlando! try a mint-julep!'" said Lee to his comrade; " like potent Astolfo, I bring beck your wits in a vial from the moon. Let me fix you comfortable."  He obtained a chair, deposited O'IHara's tired body on it, and sat down himself on a box to watch the effect of his elixir. O'Hara finally smacked his lips. "Good!" said the young gentleman on the box; " try another noonbeam, Furioso." ' Ods pittikins!" replied Corporal Orlan- do, "let him mix up another with that earthly grass, and I'll tell you how it was." The speaker obtained a reclining posture by resting the back of his head against the wall and stretching out his feet along the floor. He pointed to his cap, lying on his lap. A large slice of it was gone from the top. He held up his left wrist; it was as. black as a Moor's with bruises. He pulled open the gaping jaws of a sabre-cut on his shoulder, and showed the flesh wounded there, too. "Ye see, I got through, ister Leopold. I don't know how I done it,\ but I got through 'ein. They kept on following me, 'though, right down to the creek. I hated mightily to give up miy horse, but I had to do it. One blue divil was away ahead of the others. I just belted him, as you say, with this pistol-" "Gallant IIoratius!" interposed Lee. "And slipped through the woods, and walked up here? , "Crawled most of the way. I haven't seen so many Yankees since the race at Bull Run. The country was full of 'em. I dodged round Castlewood two days. That's full of 'emn, too. Where's Lieutenant Mark?" Poor O'Hara! H-e had been afraid to ask this momentous question before. He now raised his head upright, and his eyes shone so intensely with his anxiety that they al- most reflected themselves from nhis second julep, like two stars glassed in the mirror of a sedgy lake. "Ah, ne! Bound to be captured. No   other chance. Ho Isn't here," mournfully answered Lee. "Thrue, thrue as gospel. I got dinner the second day at Jchn Sinclair's, and some Yankees told him the evenin' of the fight that our brave -leader was wroundled, too. D-n 'em I They can 'tell the truth, when it's bad on us." "God help him!" ejaculated Lcc. And the thought of his possible dcath made him bury his face in his hands with a suppressed groan. After some time, recovering, he related to O'Hara what had happened to the main body of their small force until he left it to obtain information of the flank, in obedience to his brother's order; how he had joined a party of Taliaferro's regiment at the Black- water. "Alas! it could afford me no aid in rescuing Mark! It was driven back, too, by a brigade of the enemy. They nearly rode into Petersburg, corporal. But we- drove them away at last, fighting in Bland- ford Cemetery. The next morning, the ma- jor put me in conmmand of the station at the head of this street we are on now. Come!. it's a long walk for you, and a longer one back for me; but I'll show you over to our tent-hospital on Dunn's Hill, and then get back to the lines."  O'Hara was unable to do duty for a month. He trembled for Lee, as he lay ori his cot at night, and heard the patter of the skirmish increase to the roar of bathc; as- he saw the mortar-globcs of fire flare slowly up through the sky and fall in deadly thun- der on the works; as the cclioes of SOIme monarch-bonlb rose in successive revelrber- ations above the demoniac shouts and fiery storm of civil conflict. Lee was now a veteran and stood it brave- ly. No news firom Mark, from Castlcewood, since the money letter firom home! After the "battle of the mine," through which he passed safely, O'Hara joined hiin. His major was an Irishman, fond of O'Hara, and especially of himself; an old oak rough- ened with the winds of all varieties' of rough life, with a genuine jewel of a heart in the right place, Late in tie summer he in- formed them that, in his opinion, they had seen campaigning enough for one year.- "I have an order, boys, to send five of you to   Wilmington for blockade duty. No more pork and hard tack. Two hundred dollars a trip in gold-in gold; think of that t And cotton to make money on hand over fist- worse'n h-1 beating tanbark!" Old sinner! He knew that many a fine pair of boots and other articles of-inestimable value, during this terrible time, would find their way to his covetous, now nearly bare limbs. Lee and O'Hara reported at Rich- mond, received final instructions, saw the sights of that death-environed capital, and proceeded to Wilmington. Lee was glad to escape from this " masque of the red death" to where less of war and dissipation reached his ears, and cool breezes from the sea fanned his fevered face. The author, as he ends this chapter, wishes to speak briefly of his authority. This is partly a story of real character and real events; and, as there is a fancy somewhere of modest sculpture, to the effect that the beautiful figures of Praxiteles and Thorwald- sen are only released, like spirits, from their entombment in the shapeless block of mnar- ble, so the author has not built up, like the architect-has hardly used the brush of the painter--has rather chiseled off, like the sculptor. This simple unraveling of a not compli- cated plot will scarcely please those who have passed through such scenes, as those who have not, and can only in the steps of these novel-dressed heroes; these who see in it but a transcript of their own experience, as those to whom the deeds of the great re- bellion will be as fascinating as the histories of '75 were to our youthful curiosities; for to many, it seems, the world rolls on in an ether of the commonplace, the clouds of the   heroic dividing for its passage and coming together in its wake; so prone are we to make demigods of the dim-remembered past and the shrouded future-to consider, nay, to transact the present as without sufficient dignity and value. I Every age, Through being beheld too cdose, is ill discerned By those who have not lived past it. We'll suppose Mount Athos carved, as Persian Xerxes schemed, To the colossal stature of a man: The peasants, gathering brushwood in his ear, Had guessed as little of any human form Up there as would a flock of browsing goats. They'd have, in. fact, to travel ten miles off, Or e'er the giant image broke on them, Full human profile, nose and chin distinct, Mouth muttering rhythms of silence up the sky, And fed at evening with the blood of suns." So the authors hope of success diminishes, when he thinks how many, whom    he wants to be his readers, were heroes themselves in stern'reality of ball and buck, of guard and bivouac, of battle and march. And yet, O still youthful, but to-be grandfathers I ye who fought on the right, knew little of what was happening to the left flank, until that final charge when all rushed down together in one quivering, undulating, bleeding, blaz- ing array. Feel, then, no jealousy if I, hav- ing none in whose earnest eyes, and patient ears, and loving hearts to pour my soldier's story, am compelled to publish to your little ones what has been an amusement, yet the product of intervals snatched from harassing cares, of business. Let us together strive to erect in these tender hearts a Confederacy, spiritual, invisible, holy, whose expression is,  Glory to the heroism of our fathers I whose religion is reverence to the immortal dead; whose law is the Constitution, in defense of which their ancestors bared their bosoms to holocaustal flames!   CHAPTER XX. A LONG JOURNEY, QUICKLY GOTTEN OVER.   RETURN we to tht part-of James river where we first get sight of the Tarantula- Pyrrhicd- dance the turrets of Castlewood are performing in the twilight of an autumn day. The knightly trees no longer wave green plumes, and the last glow of the sink- ingr sun, lingering on their sere leaves, makes them appear to have been dipped in blood. Heaven grant that no misfortune has red- dened the castle floors or blackened the dresses of its inmates! "Janie!" speaks a well-known voice. The old general, with his feet stretched out along the withered grass, is reclining on the lowest of the central steps. His pointer, consider- ablv grown, nestles close up, trustfully, under his arm; the general's left hand strokes his white and dun head. Mrs. Pegram folded up the ball of yarn and the sock on which she had been knit- ting. "Is there nothing can be done to call back health to the cheeks and life -to the spirits of the girls?"  "Nothing, I fear, but peace, which will restore the absent to their homes and quiet to a convulsed land." "I've been thinking of something that is not wholly out of our power. When you nearly drove me mad sometimes, in tie days gone by, by keeping me in a lover's suspense, I used to find the most extraordinary relief in running my horse as fast as he could go, and by striving to allow nothing to pass un- noticed. In spite of Horace, travel and quick- passing scenes are the very best comforters of troubled minds. Let's travel!" "Where?" looked up Mrs. Pegram, with astonishment written on every feature. "Anywhere in this country that there are no Yankees. We are miserable here; not even safe from violence./ Think of this tonight, Janie, and answer to-morrow.- Kiss   me, old lady, before you go to look after supper." "Wchen Leicester Carlo is the favorite, your faithful Essex waits to be command- ed!" She smoothed all the sententiousness of these words away with a kiss; and the old gentleman, with the immensity of Vitel- lius and the mien of Augustus, looked very happy. The next morning a council was held in the drawing-room. The general explained the object of the assembly: "Ladies and-ladies and-ladies! the circumstances seem to your humble orator, one of 'whose age you'd scarce expects' to imperatively demand a change of air and scene. Virginia is sadly changed; the mon- ey-changers have penetrated her holy tem- ple, and changed it/into a den of thieves. If we stay here anlonger, I shall be totally out of change and I doubt if any of us could boast a change of--hem! (stitched in my side, you see)-shiftless to such a degree we might become. Ladies and-iladies!  we are like chameleons; if we try to live on any thing  but good air, we ourselves become pabulum Acherontis-morsels for death to chew as I take this secundum quid-of tobaccol And we change color with the scene we are fig-.. uring in, as the lizard changes from the green to the brown leaf. Now, '   follows that the air and scene must be good, else it's bad. Isn't that logical and an unchangeable axiom? Well, Love is the best scene-painter I ever knew in my life; we are lovers, and lovers live on air. Then let's have good air. The scenes enacting here are tragic, because Hate is the scenerer, and Yankees are the shifters, and the Yankees are playing lHate's drama of War in savage earnest. Let's trav- el! You see I have played one of the stage- tricks on you: I've talked five minutes and hardly changed the words, still less the idea   So they make scenes in the theatre, slightly changed, do for all localities and situations. Once in Petersburg I saw the same sea that roared hungrily for Perdita in Winter's Tcale one night, purl mournfully the next, being the weeping brook in which was lost poor weedy-crowned Ophelia. But, in all this mist of changing circumstance, there is one un- changeablec point: that is, ourselves. Let's take that, as a leader does his flag, and bear it to triumph and safety! He-e-e-hurrah! hurra-a-a- y!' Amid the tumultuous cheers of his troops, the general took up a map, and traced out the campaign.  "Here are three points where we shall be welcome to stay as long as we are content: Mecklenburg, Va.; Cokes- bury, S. C.; and Talladega, Ala." "Bess at Mecklenburg; dear Aunt Mary at Cokesbury. Who is at Talladega?" asked Miss Lucy. "M y old good friend, Judge Breifer.'. "'Stop!' whispered the thin lips. "Let us go to M- -. Perhaps they know some- thing of him there!" Marian choked the cry of passionate joy with which she would have hailed this sug- gestion from Lucy, and echoed quickly: "Oh! do let's go to M---." Great preparations occupied nearly a week. A trustworthy man was at length found to take care of Castlewood. Only two servants now remained to the household.  These consented cheerfully to accompany the ex- pedition. A treasure of gold, which had long lain securely under the vaults of the castle, was dug upp and divided among the four to be worn on the person. The gene- Ir    ral carried his small share in a belt. If his strength had equaled- his capacity, his girdle would have accommodated ten times all they had. One wagon, carriage, and saddle-horse completed the train. Books were packed away; every thing left deposited in the wine- cellar. Miss Lucy would not leave the harp. It was arranged to be transported in the wagon. It would require a volume to re- count the tender and comical scenes, the talk and acts, the incidents and adventures which entertained the long days of the jour- ney. Spending three .months in Mecklen- burg, they proceeded, by rail and vehicles, to Cokesbury. Half the winter was passed here. Lucy improved wonderfully, became stout and rosy. Poor Marian slowly de- dined.  The physician said the winter, even so far north, was very injurious. In the latter part of March, the train ar- rived at M--. A house was obtained, and the refugees snugly established. Dr. Hurt's surprise at being thus unexpectedly called on to resume attention to his long- lost patient may be imagined. His family and -his ballet-girl protegee's companions were brought together; mutual interests, lodged in the same absent ones, soon created- friendly sympathy. So, ye patient, who have been content to follow, unquestioning, your petulant's guide very selfish caprice, ye are again united with those whom, it is hoped, you have been longing to see once more, through all these weary months of separation, of priva- tion, of adventure, of political mishap, and private suffering.    I/ CHAPTER XXI. IN AND OUT OF IHARBOR.   THE ship IMaud, to which Leopold Wilton was assigned, lay in Smithville Harbor near- ly two -weeks. Could any more abrupt, more pleasing transition l-fre occurredl to a Confederate soldier? Here was no guard- duty, no inarch, no winter-bivouac, no bed of slushy red clay, no Greek fire of mortars. Here was almost absolute quiet; instead of miserable rations, the most delicate viands, seasoned With wines fiorom the world's vin- tages. Lee could scarcely realize the actual- ity of his situation. - Ho wondered what ,good destiny had suddenly discovered in -his life, for the sake of which it rewarded him with this rescue. IIis position was a most respectable one. He roomed with the first officer, and- dined at the captain's table. Signal officelrs were without rank, but were held responsible and intelligent. Forts and batterlies were thickly studded along the beach above and below Wilmington.   On the point of Eastern Inlet, Fort Fisher flaunted all day its defiance to the squadron off the bar. Fort Holmes below, batteries Ander- son and Gallatih above, showed threatening cannon-mouths, ever pointed seaward. At every one of these fortifications was a sigrDnl- station with a perpetual watch. The lights used ashore were torches, one-waved over the other. Those on board ship were also two in number, red and white, but provided with reflectors capable of being seen many miles, and arranged like dark-lanterns with sliding - panels. Unless the enemy were almnost directly between the signaling-ship and the shore, he was profoundly in the darIk as to this grand language mutely utter- ed across the waves. A dozen flashes, (the soldiers on the fort called it "winking,") and the commander of Fort Fisher knew that the blockade-runner was coming in, and needed the protection of his Cerbe- rus growl. Heavy, well-served gulls were   there under his control, and firequently the  Yanlkees, when they thought they   were cruising unobserved along the bar, sudden- ly felt. their fangs. Through the tortuous channels of these inlets, the most skillful pilot became at fault in the darkness. Beacons, in the shape of "L ranged Uights," were erected on the hghest bastion of the sand fort. lWhen a steamer made friendly signal, lights of different co- lors were hoisted. By keelping these in a certain relative position, the pilot steeled his ship in to safety. The system wIas very com- plete, obtaining from an English source a eulogy in the shape of a newspaper para- graph to the effect thllat, since the applica- tion of signals to blockade-running, very few ships had been lost about the coast. The second "Banshee" grounded one night below Fort Campbell, out of reach of its guns, but close to the beach. Her signal officer promptly communicated the situation. Some field-pieces were sent down from head- quarters at double-quick, and the enemy's launcheokept off until the ship's machinery was readjusted, the tide lifted her off tho bottom, and she came in harbor amidst the cheers of the garrison and much congratula- tory champagne.  Much of the honor of saving the vessel was accorded to the sig- naler. The magnificent stearer Hope had a si- milar misfortune and-like relief. Every one Srill understand how difficult, how nearly impossible it was that a pilot, coming in on a black, misty night, should recognize the spot on the coast wnhereo the vessel should change her course to follow the coast-line. The signal-system decided for him in the-glance ox light. The Maud was a fine vessel, and af- forded Lee unceasing sources of delight, in- specting her machinery, studying her rig,   and signaling epigrams to his comrades ashore. She was provided with a juvenile steam- boat, similar to that with which, bearing a torpedo on its prow, a certain Confederate officer nearly blew up the frigate Minne- sota at Hampton Roads in 1864. In this Lee steamed about Smithville Harbor, hunt- ed rice-birds along the Cape Fear swamps, and visited Baldhead Lighthouse, which, from the top of its ninety feet tower, with its single Cyclops eye, glared to mariners the danger of Frying-Pan Shoals. At length the coal for which the Maud had been waiting came down in lighters, and every thing was got ready to run out. Lee ascertained before sunset, by signal from Fort Holmes's lookout, that ten cruisers lay off the bar. Steam was ordered at dark. Tile white smoke curled up in thin, trans- parent clouds from the immense funnels; grinding, the anchor-chains coiled round the steam-worked capstan; and slowly, in -the first gloom of darkness, the ship Inoved by Fort Caswell. Lee knew when she crossed " the rip " by the roll-anld toss suddenly communicated by the ground-swell of the sea. The boom of the surf drowned to all ex- cept those on board the sound of the wheels, the muttered reports- of the leadsman, Three,' "Half three," "L Quarter three," and the low commands of the pilot to the man at the helm, "Starboard a little," ' Steady," "Steady it is, sir.' Lee flashed his signal to Fort Campbell, and the " range light " was set. Every eye was strained in search-of the enemy's ships. Stately, spectral, the Maud glided through the waves. "Half two," "Two," "Quarterless two." The depth gradually diminished as the bar was approached. Suddenly a grating sound, and total ces- sation of motion ahead, while the ship swung partly round. "By G-d! she's stuck." "Sail, oh! one on each bow." There is need of quick orders and quick action.   "Reverse her!"   "Full head!" "Your fires, down there," the captain shouts down his trumpet-pite, "make 'em burn; and shut off your smoke." "Full speed!"* -"Now she goes off!" "Port-port a little; steady!" "Steady it is, sir." "Where are the infernal Yankees?' "Here, sir; here's a marine glass, see that huge black fellow, right -abeam now?" "My God! why don't they go ahead down there? - Mr. Signal Officer, send the chief-engineer up here immediately." "Ay, ay, sir."  "Now she clears i' "Half three; four fathoms." "Open her out!- full speed ahead. I'll run her right betweeen their knees, and trust to the ' old lady's' heels!" The " old lady" leaps with -the fresh im- petus, trembles with the agony of her effort, and dashes behind a writhing wake of phos- phorescence. Rockets from the enemy go up, whizzing over her in the dark like meteors, and ex- plode, throwing a lurid light far across the waves.  Broadsides froml  the- gunboats thunder across the " old lady's " track and wake. Musketry riddles her boats pendent from the davits. "Both children gone! Shot through like sieves!" so the mate reported the last fact. "Two men right away to stop their gaping mouths," ordered the captain in reply; ' let lem have the carpenter to help, too. No crying brats now!" On! on! flying at the rate of eighteen knots. The black objects, belching so much fire, flashing like bloody hydras, and then vanish- ing in the gloom, fall] slowly on the quarters astern, finally fade from sight. The shells continue to whiz in the distance, and the rockets flare their brief torches, searching for the daring vessel. The -aud, changing her course a little to the southward, proceeds with unabated eed. The pilot turns over the care of the ip to the first officer; she is free of the coast, heading for Bermuda. The captain warmly shook Lee's hand, gave directions to set the watch, and retired.   CHAPTER XXII. ' ADIEUI, my friends! Adieu, my foes 1  hMy love with thee. The bursting tears my heart declare; Adieu, my native banks of Ayr!" BURNS.   THE novelty anrid excitement of the first run utterly drove from Lee's eyes all dispo- sition to sleep. 'The sea was calm and he felt no sickness. He leaned over the railing around the wheel-hlouse, and suffered his thoughts to go back over the road he had traveled for nearly a year. , Far astern the flash of an occasional gun sparlkled -in the gloom, and the long boom died awray, the sea- caves swallowing up man's and Ncptune's wrath. W'ith sword and shield Orion climb- ed the battlements of the slky, and the vailed Pleiades looked softly down on the rage of peoples and the dreams of men. Miles of faithless water were separating him firom all that he held dear; swiftly he was borne from his bleeding fatherland, on the fearful wings of steam. As'in boyhood he used to throw his cap upon a butterfly, Lee felt that Omnipotence, whether God, or chance, or fate, held over him the star-decked vault of heaven, and all his powers, his poor, fluttering winrgs, were useless in this struggle with Infinity. Eo- lus might open the cavernous madhouse of the winds, and the seaman's skillful hand dropped powerless to his side. "Dust to dust!"    HUmAnity needed no inspiration to know, only faith to appreciate, this truth. Men sweat, and toil, and battle; sit each, crowned, a moment on his little throne, lins his small triumphs, and gratifies his mean passions.  In the end the curtain falls, the lamps of life are quenched: "And the angels, all pallid and wan, Uprising, unvailing, affirm, That the play is the tragedy, Mian, And its hero, the Conqueror Worm." Each man is pitted against the hundreds that he meets, together -with his own pas-   sions, led by the tyrant Evil, settled in his hearlt. How few of these Desdichados finletd a Sluggard Knight with the armn and heart of King Richard to rush to their assistance I I-ow many enemies stand panoplied to at- ta ck! If man is irnmortal, why do not the spirits of the loved dead and loved absent visit us again, to warn or encourage?-comne in the stillness of the soldier's Mwatch, in the tumul- tuous loneliness of the sea? Perhaps the only iimmortality is the addli- tional impulse required to produce the flower blooming above theo- grave; this impulse, this particle of intelligence, continually traveling from the component parts to the unknown centre of the universe, imparted at birtlh, withdrawn and again bestowed at dissolu- tion. Hl Humanity is the eye with which earth looks to heaven."  Ay, and the heavens blast the  poor eye with lightnings, and freeze it with sleet; andlthe eye not yet blasted  looks cold and  unpitying on the frozen dead eye, and earth sets her myriad worms to kiss, in mockery of sweet love's washed-out kisses, and to foully crawl where fame-wreaths twined. And where is any but the blasting heaven I Up there among the stars?  Alh I at this moment are not they-the restless, toiling, unhappy of those worlds-gazing hither for the paradise, ten- dentes manuszue   ripo ultcrioris anzmofa Does not this earth glitter as a star to those distant orbs?  Is it not to these what every one of them seems to us-one of the " ever- lasting blossoms  of heaven"?  Ever thus to yearn for, and never to grasp, is not this the unmerited Tantalus-punishuient Jove- Chance has inflicted on us?    Such disjointed, dark thoughts crowded  into Lee's mind; such was the chain of  questioning and doubt, which, broken off by the activity of his military life, now re- united its ghastly links. His love had not come, like Alark's, to sweep suddenly away these wiles which the spider, skepticism, weaves in the blrain. Imperceptibly, gradu- ally, that love had grown with his age, and, while it was none the less strong, had ac-  quired somewhat the dutiful tinge of family affection. Some plant-roots strike deep and at once into the soil; others shoot along the shallow strata under the surface. No stolrm will prostrate the first; the smallest over- throws the last. The first character of love grapples and wins-its triumphs; of the last the battle is postponed, is contested more closely, and with more varying fortune. A few drops of spray, borne from  the cleavingl prow as the wind freshened, fell on Lee's face and interrupted his reverie. He pulled his handkerchief from his pocket: a folded paper came out with it and fell on the deck. A  slight tremor shook him as he thought it might have gone in the sea. He had never been able to send it to its desti- nation. It was much soiled, closely sealed, and addressed, "Marian Laroux." He won- dered if hle should not have left it with some friend in Wilmincton. He knew it must be very important to Marian: how-he only puzzled himself with questioning. "It shall be sacredly kept, anyhow," he said to himself, and placed it in a belt which contained the few dollars in specie he had- carried, almost during the war, as a last resort. The moon now came up from the under- world and threw its bright-spanning ladder of light alqng the waves so silvery and in- viting it made the dreamer long for angel- sandals, wherewith to leave this poor earth and climb into the empyrean. The watch reported a sail " dead astern." In blockade-running every thing in wind and water has its importance . The muffled cry, "Sail, o-h!" spreads its news like light- ning and creates intense excitement. Only when the ship drops anchor in port does her crew breathe out the long sigh which has been pent up during the voyage. The little sail of the nautilus is almost   expected to belch out some bomb-pellet from a tiny gun. A certain captain was the laugh of Ber-. muda for haying, it was said, turned back with affright at the white wing of a sea-bird. The blockade-runner is the Jean Valjean of maritime society. The poor, escaped con- vict, having under, his wing some Cosette- freight of assistance to a suffering, dying people, is the enemy of every thing else.' Its police corps of spies and. pursuers is all- extensive and insatiate. Now every body was on deck. . Looking. through a night-glass, Lee could see Javert, a low, black object, away to the left of the rising moon. "Two miles, about," the cap- tain said. The Maud was going at a very leisurely rate; her fires were being cleaned out. "She has made us, sir!" said the first mate, "I'm glad we've got him to leeward,' replied the captain. "Give one of these fel- lows the wind, and nine out o' ten you're gone."  In five minutes the Maud resumed her full speed. Lee and Vincent, the purser, were stand- ing, at one side of -the bridge amidships, straining to peer back into the darkness. "Of all excite ments," said Vincent, "none: can equal in intensity this aroused by a chase. You are still, standing quietly among your comrades, able to talk to them, while you are on the thing that is rushing at such a frightened rate.'" "Yes, look there P! replied Lee, 4' the very  waves seem demons, mounting up in heaving, dark barriers to oppose us. The gallant Maud cleaves through or leaps over them, and dashes back their remains in her foam- ing wake. Here they comne, slinking back with the howls of a disappointed animal 1" "I can't see her now, Wilton, can you? No; yes; there she is again, Lee! A little to the. left of where our wake fades and vanishes in the dark, most to the rim of the sea!" "Yes, the infernal old whaleP! growled Vincent. "Spouting smdke, instead of the sperm- kind," added Lee. "By Jove 1 I wish we had one or two thirty-two pounders!--we could   knock her right over the white edge of the ocean yonder." "Where's. the d-d spouter?" broke in the captain, joining them and -repeating his question in a half-whisper, half-shout to the second mate, who stood "forrarc i" the bridge to pass the word. "Where away now mate?" "A point on the port-quarter, sir," was the hissed reply. "Bunten, open your valves,! open her out! See that your imps chuck in plenty of the black crumbs! she's comin' on us. Here, steward! make the cook rake- the galley for grease, and turn over all you've got to the engineers! Below,!" he thundered down the trumpet to the engine-room, "fan your fires! blow 'em up! don't mind the smoke, shut your doors! D-n it, what -we want's speed now." The long masts quiver as their taper points roll from side to side. The practiced eye of the sailor perceives the chase to gain the fraction of a knot, and he curses "those d--d engineers." -The bo'sw'n's "Heeey, ah! heeey! hearty, my lads!" grows short and husky, directing the men who tug at sheets and yards and clamber about the ratlines' making all snug and trim. Below, the greasy, dusky firemen are plied with ale, and shovel huge piles of coal into   the seething furnaces; steadily, the cranking engine does its workl and the wheel-fans beat the water into foam. For half an hour the close race went on. "Can no more be got out of her?" roars the captain dowmn to the engine-room. The Maud was making forty revolutions of her huge wheels to the minute. Bunten, chief- engineer, soon reported'forty-two. Slowly Javert fell off. Jean Valjean got safely over the bridge of Austerlitz. The black walls of night and the increas- ing distance sternly compress Javert into nothingness.  Valjean has got /his rope fastened round the body of Cosette; that is, the captain of the Maud, Vincent, and Lee take a glass of brandy on deck. Teeth-gnashing Javert grows desperate, and fires his bow-gun. "Worse thing he-can do to save his life," says the captain of the Maud, smacking his lips. The concussion of the shot placed Javert back several seconds. He continues to fire, and continues to lose way. Jean Valjean is safely over the wall of the convent. Javert is the smallest speck on the pdge of the ocean. The darkness press-  es him out, he topples over, and is gone.   CHAPTER XXIIIL T EI E  F A RO  FA N A T I C  I DO not knowr the man I should avoid So soon as that spare CaSiUis.

"EE slept very late the following morning,  and was only roused by a larger than usual dash of spray on his cabin window-. The nmonotonous groan of the machinery, dlriven by the merciless power of steam, seemed like the unceasing, painful toil of some Titanic Ixion. Lee dressed himself with great difficulty, the ship rolled so, and, after he had thrown on his clothing, felt considerable nausea. He met Vincent on deck, who laughed at his blanched face, and advised him to drink somnething. "Two Angostura cocktails, steward! It stays your stomach, my boy; and, unless that all-important part of our rig is assisted by some grog, it topples like a shivered mast -overboard." Lee enjoyed the brandy, stirred about the deck, got thoroughly drenched with spray, and felt perfectly well again. The tiny flying-fish rose, sparkled a few moments like meteors above the blue wave, and vanished in its depth. Fields of yellow sea-weed floated in the Gulf Stream, still fervered from the Equator's touch, and bear- ing its warmth to the frozen islands of the other henmisphere. Lee and Vincent were compelled to take off the winter clothing that had been neces- sary at Wilmington. The two young men became well acquainted during'the day. Lee was alternately drawn toward, and repelled by, his companion.  Vincent was nearly twenty-five years of age, thinly framed, and with the delicate face of a woman. A blush   lived always on his florid cheek; the blue veins gleamed under the white, transparent skin; but the eyes were almost flat, lustre- less; yet, if he grew excited, they effervesced from below,v as if his soul were a glass of the champagne he loved so well. Lee knew the national hauteur and jealousy of Englishmen in their social intercourse with foreigners, and was therefore charmed with the warmth of Vincent's first associar tion with him. He never tired of asking and hlearing Lee speak of the great events transpiring in the Southern States.  He Sympathized with the South, but, being a foreigner, he could discuss with coolness where Lee was hot and precipitate. He was intelligent, knew and remembered much history. "-Fanaticism, do you call it?" ; He and Lee were pacing across the deck of the toss- ing vessel, late in the afternoon, after din- ner, during which meal wine flows like water, o rather to the utter exclusion of such natural drink,  "Few people know what that is, excuse me if I say it. Hasn't every one of us his fanaticism? At least, I wouldn't give, a spoonful of Heidsieck for the millk-and-water man that hasn't. Why say fanaticism, only when a faction or a multitude or a nation unite in one grand enthusiasm? Your passion for music and poetry; the sailor's for the sea; this one's for priestcraft, hellcraft, or any enthusiasm; mine for-well, I don't know what I'm good for-but, call them what you please, hob- bies, if you wish; they are genuine wild   Arabians, after all. Let a inan be a fanatic about something, and not fritter himself away in too many directions. A people says, Slavery must die! Now, the only way to kill it is to chop it off root and branch at one fell blow. If a few birds lose their rest- ing-place or a thousand caterpillars their food, why, all right: the evil to' millions is made harmless." "Stop!" interrupted Lee. - "You now destroy the very essence of fanaticism. It is fanaticism, only because it is blind ; bc- cause, in its blindness, it mistakes the good tree for the poisonous; because it sees poi- son where it is not, and seeks good where  it can not be found; because the evil to Imil- lions is as the smallest mustard-se(d to a pumpkin, compared with the wrong done the birds and worms. Slavery has in it not onrke thousandth part of the bad that is in the hearts of abolitionists, in John Brown raids, in emancipation proclamations, and in the unearthly civil war now raging. If you will prove that the South is an Iphigenia sacrificed for the triumph of the nineteenth century in this country, I will yield." "You surely will not contend, Mr. .South- erner, that the sudden ravaging of a nation equals, in horror, the life-long, bondage of thousands?" Yegs, sir; when, the life-long bondage i0 proved to have in it very few grains of hor- ror, and is sanctioned bythe hand-book of ages and the constitution of the world." ' The Bible sanctions slavery and a greatI many other now and to be obsolete things, but it never counseled the nations to stand still and to cease to progress. I suppose, a million years hence, the inhabitants of this planet will .very nearly have reached a cornM- prehension of the infinite scheme; that then we will understand how the patriarchal sys-  tem was but the world's primer; how the I universe, thirty-five hundred years before  the advent of one called Christ, was only x an infant lisping its mysterious A B C.-at the knee of the great Jehovah; and men o will love angelically, beyond-passionately ; 1 anlid women wnon't hate you for loving them N too well; and slavery will be firecdoml, for  freedorn will be slave to love; and men will ' play far'o with dove-eyed lichael, - while 1 lute-hearted Israfel leads the maidens to 1   the dance; and, by a proper adjustment of steam-macllincry, they'll sail the old tub of the earth inl any way they please about thle sun, thaw the everlasting glaciers at the poles, fan the hot cheeks of the tropics, and every man be perfect lawr unto himself! and " "Good heavens! thou ecstatic prophet, look out! Thou art leaning over this rail so far into the future that thou wilt become a briny-wet thing, of the past the vcry next larch!" "I'd have gotten over the million years quicl;, then, wouldn't I?" "In about five minutes, unless we could have hauled you baclk withl a hawser. I thank You for that idlcal triumpllhalll pro-. grcss; but you have not convinced mel that this meddlesolme Ncw-England fanaticisml is i step in the right direction." "Well, all imnpulse goes to excess; and but for this excess, perhal sherc would not be any reform. 'The jealo sy of Catholicism enacts the night of Bartholomow; thc jcea- lousy of popular will erects a gibbet for .il- fated Charles ; the jealousy of paganismr consigns its opponents to the merciless aim- phitheatre; Fenelon cnds in Robespierre; andcl out of all tis foul enrichment grow sweetest cereals and most generous vines. Behold! the vine of Cbrist,-p lante1 on0 Cazl- vary,- hath covered the cross \tCeah purple richness, and spread s to the utterlmost parts of the earth, and climbs up to heaven. Abo- lition may hack  and wound  it, but 'twill grow the mlore profusely for that." "Be13csti cast the drunkard-lllurderer into Sing Sing for life!" cxclaimned tLee angrily. "A  nation grows sick; fanaticism is the sore blister whichl draws out the disease -" Vincent was proceeding, when, suddenly turning, he said, "But forgive me, Wilton! I'm sick of discussion, too." And he graspcd Lee's hand, while his indescribable eyes glared in unison with his cold smile.  A  small bird flr by thhem and lighted on a guy-wrire of one of the funnels. Whether the weary-looking little fellow had come out with them, or had flowrn to the ship as the only olive-branch in sight, they lncew not. Thc sailor at the wheel looked askance at the frigltencd  nostljr, anld iluttered some- thing  about the bad luck thus foreboded.   "It wa' ae wrang ony hoo to rin oot Friday eve." "You don't believe any such doctrine as that, do you, Kennedy?" said Vincent. "Hout awa, mon! Ye'r sae little time frae sucklin'; ye canna see muckle abune the cast o' ye ain een. It maunna fa' sae avery tap; but whae eer heard o' Captain Laroux syne he gaed oot Glasgow ane Fri- day sunnap?' Laroux! Laroux! Lee thought of the breastpin he carried near his heart, of the paper in his belt. What strange chances were forever throwing this unusual name in his way! 'Marian Laroux, tutoress at Castlewood! Captain Laroux, lost at sea! With these contrary winds, Lee's fancy went over the surface wild conjecture, like a forever tacking lt, leaving a tan- -gled, intricate wake tha3 foamed up into visible history-shapes for a moment, and then-vanished in the sea. The wind freshened as the night fell, and now blew stiffly from the north. In the forenoon, three sail had been sighted to the ' suthard." The sailors -pronounced them to be two steamers in chase of a blockade-runner. On account of this, the Maud's course, once altered to Nas- sau, was now changed back to Bermuda. Before midnight the wind swelled to a fierce gale. Lee was awaked by the fran- tic straining and plunging of the ship, and   found all hands working at the pumps. The carpenter, having been sent-in the hold, reported that three solid shot had struck the side just below the water-line, and so loosened the rivets of the steel-platingt, that there was a leak along nearly half the length of the ship. It was impossible to stop it L with oakum.- The pumps would keep her free, the captain said, if the gale did not in- crease. Yet that it was a terrible situation was expressed in the countenances of officer and sailor. Lee lay in his bunk, and, as the ship would strain with creaking timbers up to the crest of some mountainous wave, and then plunge deep, recklessly, as if it would never stop going down, thought of those dear ones who make life not only endurable, but a very paradise; thought of her who was now happily ignorant of his peril; of those glorious battle-fields through whose fiery ordeals-he had safely passed, whose honorable, chaplet-crowned tombs he had thanked Heaven for being saved from, only, perliaps, to sink now. . . His mind re- fused to complete the unendurable vision. He, whose mettle spurned the danger of Sharpburg, buried his face in his hands and groaned aloud. Fortunately, his exer- tion at the pump had created fatigue. He fell asleep before dawn in spite of all these rest-dispelling circumstances.   CHAPTER XXIV. THRES stormy nihts and stormy days We tossed upon the raging maia, And long we stlrove our bark to save, But all our striving was in vain. Lowr.   ILEOPOLD WILTON felt ashamed of his fears the next morning, when the gale totally ceas. ed, and the sun came out,clear and hot. But the ship still labored in the heavy seas. The grand forces lately at work, fiown fiercely back at the Angel of Peace, retiring sullenly and with reluctant steps. So large is the storm-king's retinue, that, long after he has passed, his attendant wcaves swell on in his train. Not seldom the ships which have slipped through the vanward fury of the monarch fall a prey to the anger of his headless followers. Breakfast, the morning, and dinner were quietly passed. About four o'clock, while the iofficers wsere sipping wine in the captain's room and dis- cussing the hour at which they would make Bermuda, an engineer came running aft with the intelligence that a new leak had sud- denly made its appearance under the fire- room. I These damned engineers," said Vincent, while Bunten, the chief, was extricating him- self from table totafford all the assistance possible to his satrapy of the ship kingdom, "work so much in steam and heat, they have an unconquerable fear of any but fire- watel. I'll wager, if 'alf-and-'alf was pour- ing in through ever so large a chink, all hands would drown, before Bunten and Jen- kins would find tongue to try and scare somebody." "D--n you! I don't know how we ever got a pump called a donkey, unless a fellow like you used to work it," retorted Bunten, as his dingy   blue snlock-tails whisked through the door. "Open a leak in that other bottle, stew-   S ard!" said the captain, "Let's drink to Bun- ten, M D., that is, inule-driver!" t  '"Merry devil," suggested Lee, entering a boisterously into the fun, more boistcrously, r perhaps, to conceal thie loud protest uttered, in his own soul, against such life, in favor of purer things. ' Here's to Bunten, Blue IKing of the Mer- I ry Devils, or Merry King of the Blue Devils, which -you pase," shouted Vincent, only too happy to whip away the mule-driving idea. "Here's death to all the blue devils in creation, except them  of Bunten's sort! Health to the grays. The devil take the \ blues!" toasted the captain. "Q eneral Lee, let's hear from you!" cx- claimed Vincent to Wilton, filling at the - same time his glass with wine. "To the gallant blockade-runner, who bears love-messages and coffee from the Queen of the'Isles to the tattered South!" "Three cheers for General Lee! both of 'em! 1 -Nine for the Queen l'} roared tihe  captain. "Come, .general," said Vincent to Wilton, again otering him wine, 'L don't waver, if you ait a waver! PI'm going to drink to the wavs of -your flag and the waves of the sea. Both wave us into port. Fill up!" "Cap'n, the water's pourin' in like h-1; firemen up to their knees, now!" shouted Bunten in the door, and rushed back to hip post. "Cool, cool men! The fires won't be out in an hour yet!" quietly spoke the captain, while the utmost excitement blazed from the flushed t&I s of the drinkers "Had it comueo this, at lasth" thought Leo.   Had he been the favorite of fortune so long  for this, to sink, like a plummet out from its 1 line, to briny, cold death!        It was not hard to calculate how long it - would be ere the dread time came.    i The pumps were utterly powerless in con-  flict with so fierce an inrush of the sea. f True, the cotton might float the vessel for ] a time; but then she would sink, at last,  and all that interval they would die a thou- i sand times with the dread expectation of ' death. A bale of cotton alone is the very poorest of all buoys. It is beyond the power of a drowning man, even, to remain with one in a. rough sea; it turns round continually, like a revolving cage with a squirrel.  "Can you swim, Wilton?"   Vincent's smile was ghastly as he asked this, and cut a life-preserver from the railing to which it was attached. l Not much. -I never tried the ocean, though." Lee was more collected than he had been in the more distant peril of the night before. He lashed another preserver securely under his arms, and placed all his valuables about his person. Despair had not come yet. If nothing can be done, too, it is still bet- ter to keep men in this situation at work; it prevents them from beconming frantic with torture. Every man, therefore, took -his turn at the punips. All on deck kept continual lookout. "Good God! Vincent, what is the matter forward? There is the watch comnning down. Lee sprang along the top of the deck-house to the foot of- the foremast. Here was a scene of the most desperate excitement: the man at the mast-head, becoming wild at the prospect of approaching death, swore that he would no longer remain aloft, and was now rapidly descending the ratlines; the first mate stood wit' an iron crow, threaten- ing, if he ddid not at once ascend, to dash out his brains the moment he reached the deck, shouting: l"The d-d fool! don't lie klnow he's in as good a place as any of us, if she does go down?"TWhile several seamen sulrround- ed him, fiercely-glaring at the speaker, and armed, each with what he found ready t^o be grasped. Lee caught the bar from the aging officer,   and, exclainiing, "Poor coward!" pushed the sailor, who just then reached the deck, over two tiers of cotton-bales, seized a glass, and leapt up the rope-ladder that swayed from- the- ship's side to the quivering mast. He had ascended but a few steps before he found it impossible to continue while the heavy life-preserver- weighed about him, and stopped to cut it free. As he did so, the mate recovered from his astonishment and dashed up the opposite side of the niast. A cheer rang from the crew when Lee's hand touched first the cross-piece of the lookout. But here was the most difficult part of his undertaking-to swing from where the shrouds terminate on the mast to the  narrow strip of wood called "lthe crow's nest." Into this the practiced strength of the sailor easily lifted him. His heavy. boot struck Lee's right hand and loosened its hold. He -as suspended by his left. Sev- eral times he tried to lift himself and -grasp with the other, but vainly. His strength was nearly gone. Several men ran up the ropes to his res- cue. Ere they had half-reached him his. weak arm had relinquished its seizure, and he dropped into the sea. A half-dozen lines uncoiled along the water, thrown by admniring hands from the deck. By one he was drawn quickly and safely aboard. "How long /owill the wheels. turn, Bunten?" "Thirty minutes, siti, not more." Still the filling ship plows its headlong way. The gallant horse, fainting with that deep wound in his breast, will not yield, until the blood surge from its broken chan- nels and drown the mettle enshrined in his heart. "Sail, oh " O God! the intense, unutterable joy of that cry! A drop or waier to heat-shriveled tongues, food. to them that are fiends with hunger, the Saviour's blessed touch on eyes dark fr am sightless birth; it plucks life from 'he jaws of death; poor plumed hope, throttled by the tearing talon of. expectant deicath, floats on into the west, to bathe in new light its ruffled wing. "W here away?" "Two points on the starboard bow, sir."   In twenty minutes she is made out to be a fore-and-aft - schooner. The last strokes of the engine now propel the fated ship in the direction of life. Horror of borrolrs! the schooner runs away, spreading all h*canvas. "Takes us for a privateer!" The signal of distress rattles up the peak, the wheels are stopped, and the poor ship, helpless, disfreighted, and dismantled, rocks and tosses, a dead thing upon the wsaves. These, vengeful, spare not their lifeless vic- tinm. The Mwaters hiss against her torn sides, throw up gigantic hands, and wrench the wood firom  the wheel-houses; like demons at play, foam and surge along lher decks, dash into thIis unbattened hatch, into that unlidded scuttle;  remorseless, boardcing pirates leap for the most richly furnished cabins; swing, like acrobats, in strange con- tortions about the sails. No longer swrim- ming above the sea, water-logged, the ship floats, a bloated corpse, beneath and through the waves. It is an interminable age to the half- drowhed souls on board ere the signal is understood and rescue comes borne on the wings of the wind.  Blessed winds, that erewhile swept the main with killing wrath, they come now like heaven-pardloned crimi- nals, bearing balmy gifts of grateful. peni- tence. Deeper settles the dead ship. ,Wild with fierce kindness, the captain rushes through the cabins, commanding that every man shall immediately quit the hulk; startles the sailors plundering office and stolres, hurls apart two men in-deadly combat for a. watch lost in the confusion, calls them " thieves. "Fools! will ye die drunk-no peace made nwith God or man? Jump, mny hearties, swimn off, or we're a11l sucked dow( n Nwith her!" From mere habit of obedience answering "Ay, ay, sir," but halting with the unlealrthlly passion of greed, they yet prepare to leave the settling vessel ere the last throe colnes. "Astern, astelrn, Wilton; not froin the side!'" Vincent and Lee leap togetherl, the rwaves clasp them eagerly, and bear them, strugorgling, thirty feet from the vessel. A steward, not so advised, springs from the   wheel-hotse amnidships; in anothher moment lie is lifeless, dashed back agtlilnst the metal -flan es of the wheel. Of the thirty bodies that lived and wrorked upon the Maud, atlcngth tswenty-eight stand erect on the deck of the schooner; ,two were sucked into the sea's capacioLIs minaw, and their souls stood, we knlow not how, before God. Then, in the gloom of twilight, the aban- doned ship clilmbed to the top of the last wave, rested, poised a moment, as if prepar- ing for the fatal plungec, and went down for- evcer. The condition of the H-arcebell is found to be nearly as dreary as that was of the Maud.   She is a collier boundl friom Phla- delphia to New-Orleans. Three hundred tons of coal rattle in her hold. Her topmasts are carried awny, so is a portion of her gunnel, and the sea brealks across her waist in surges of brine. The brcakers have penetrated her wAatelr-tanks and turned their contents almost as bitter as the sea. A few gills of molasses are forlu- nately found, and sweeten pnough to quelnch eacll man's thirst. The galley, containthg stoveC and cooking, utensils, has been was ed of deck. A black nighit and a black ctd to Lee's bright anticipations! Through the hours of darkness, the poor i tling that bolre him on her breast tossed hellnless firom wave to 'wave. HunHner and' thirst tortured tlic toil-worn, drcnchedl bodies of himnsclf and,hiis collmrades. I1 the mornlling, mighty Prospclro calmcd the unruly spirits of the " vasty deep ;" the tolrn sails were1 patched, and a gentle wind fanned them slowly towardl the Somcr Isles. Three days after the loss of thlle Maudl, tilhe Harebll hoistedl her stars and stripes unllder the villa-studded 'white and green hill-sides of Bernmudia. Lee was told that anothler shilp a\waitcd. him, was frnisheld soime adv inc   Imoney by his einployclrs, and, trudging tip the strange streets, took up cheap lodgings on thel sumirnit of one of the hills -whch ovcr. look the largest islalnd, St. CGeorge's. Here lIe3 was joilned by Vincenlt, wlio sworo that, since the sea had not separated them   by sending Lee to Elysium and himself to Hades, the land certainly should not part them. However Lee's secret thought demurred against this avowal of Vincent's determina- tion to stick to him, his courtesy would not permit him to offer any coldness to such a proffer; and he resolved to know before he thoroughly condemned his new friend for   the occasional repulsive phase that showed sometimes its cloven feet in his character. "Besides'" he said to himself, "I want to study men; and am I not too-well defended to fear any, even the slightest peril from so mere a worldling as this?" Alas! How completely a little mist may enshroud a star I How much of the brightest eye the smallest film will blind!    CHAPTER XXV. THE  INNOCENT TOSSING   OF VINCENT, JUNIOR S BOYISH   CURLS  IS THE SHAKING OF "GORY "OCKS  TO VINCENT, SENIOR! REMORSE is a terrible harpy. It alights on feast-tables, dabbles with filthy webs in the most deiicate viands and spoils all the flavor of the wine in which the wretched would forget!      !    THE climate of the Bermuda Islands is most glorious. .It is neither hot nor coldl. It trembles in a delicious balance between these two extremes. You eat oranges and tropical fruits; oleander blooms, growing to the dignity of an oak; yet a braoig softness inclines you to seek exercise in the never frost-stung air.      - Yellow-fever, which had nearly depopu- lated the cities and kept so many ships idle during the summer, was just vanished, and the little, low, white-rock stores teemed with wares. Lee became wild at sight of huge heaps of glittering coin which clerks swept about the desks, of their employer's counting-rooms. Something new continually roused his ovei- grown desire, and it was not long ere he had remaining scarcely enough of his ad- vance to rattle in his pocket as he went along the crowded streets. -His employers would not send in the new ship on account of the continued rumors of a fleet preparing at Newport's News. At length, came intelligence of the first unsuccessful bombardment of Fort Fisher. The work on Lee's vessel was hurried up, and one morning she got up steamn. How the youngster's heart beat with pride and expectation! He would get a brief furlough and run home. He would be as a spirit from the other world to these so long beleaguered Confederates; his " hair-breadth escapes by flood" would be so interesting to the heroes wiho were going through those by field 1' Perhaps he would see the noble family in Virginia, if he had not time, during the ship's stay at Wilmington, to go to M--.   At last he could delivelr to Marian Laroux the paper he guarded so sacredly!- A paper from the streaming life-blood of a wounded enemy; Captain Laroux lost at sea; a trinket, marked like the sealed com- munication, found in the neighborhood of his camp! These three points were, in Lee's mind, a mental tripod, supporting a " peep- show," which was filled with a thousand romantic creations, like the revolving, ever- changing shapes of a kaleidoscope. While hle was gazing at this entertain- ment his fancy brought on the mental;:boards, and idly pacing up and down the poop-deck, the steamer Owl camne into harbor. "Hallo, Wilton!" said Vincent, "there's a blockade-runner. Practice your diabolical art and find out what's new." Lee caught up his small crimson flag, and made signal to the vessel that now floated, swan-like, through the narrow channel of the port. From side to side the silk fluttered above his head half a minute. His question had flown across half a mile of water, and leaning, on his flag-staff, he in- terpreted to an interested group the answer. "We went into Wilmington-" j "A glorious beginning, gentlemen!" "All right-' "What did I tell you, Bunten?" broke in the captain, while Lee was silently reading another clause of the invisible writing. "And found Smithville in our posses- sion-^ "Aha, Bunten!" "Wait, cap'n!" replied the engineer, "I might have you, yet I I'm d-" "But our troops were blowing up Cask   well and Campbell, to fall back toward Wil- minaton-" "Give us that basket of wine, cap n!" The English engineer's regret for the Con- federate disaster was nothing to the pleasure of winning the wine. I'll take them five soverins, captain!" said Vincent, with his singular smile. "As the enemy already held the upper inlet, and, it was thought, would march at once to the city, we ran back here without breaking bulk.'" The consternation among the merchants and blockade-runners of Bermuda when it was announced that Wilmincton had fallen -what was the same thing to them, Fort Fisher captured-is indescribable. English- men regarded the cause of the South lost; Confederate securities were worth nothing; goods went down in price, as well as toward Nassau and Afatamoras. Lee proceeded to the former. place, joined by two or three friends and Vincent. Here they learned that Charleston was abandoned. Lee was desperate with disappointment and anxiety. He and Vincent strolled in a bar-room, took several drinks, and met an acquaintance, who advised them to go to Havana. Lee grew very much excited in the fierce consultation that was held amidst jangling of glasses, oaths, and ribald jests. "D-n it!" he said, almost reeling and smiling the smile which malke us, over- looking these scenes, tremble with horror, "' D-n it I Vincent, we'll go to Havana, and flirt with the seforitas " -  The Corsica sailed that afternoon. The young men barely reached her in time. It is a voyage of but thirty-six hours. One Sunday morning in February, Lee -and his companions took one of the gayly decked and bedizened boats which fill the harbor of Havana; and, amidst the fierce jabbering of a thousand tongues, landed on tha quay of the custom-house. A splendid band on board of a Spanish -man-of-war strove w ith the sunlight -to enli- ven the day; innumerable barges with paint- ed awnings were sailed and oared about the bay; a score of yellow flags floatedr above the dingy turrets of Castle Moro; gayly dressed forms flitted among the trees of the   "Pescado vivo" promenade: warmth, and color, and pleasure, and brightness held high revel in this Granad-like ' vase, filled with diamonds and jacinths, the treasure-house of Spain." An excellent room was obtained at the Hotel de Europa. The morning passed with snoozing and sipping iced drinks. Dinner came at four-more than twrenty courses, fish, oyster, pate de-foies gras, fried bananas,- stuffed onions, huge sweet pota- toes,.or rather one, for this numnber sufficed for the entire table, incredible rehashes of hash, and common claret, followed by guava jelly, pastries, anid fruit, including the rose- hearted sapote,-coffce, and cigarettes. Come, Wilton,' said Vincent, when the meal was concluded, "now for the Prado! I've been here before, and will protect you from the rascally Spaniards, who will make a'most infernal jabber of protests and indig- nation whcn they settle your bills, and real- ize a hundred per cent for every esczudo that leaves your pocket." -- He hailed a volante bearing on its front the required badge, "Se Alquildr;" they settled themselves comfortably in it, and were rapidly rattling over the- pavement of the narrow streets. Tley passed the arch of the wall sur- rounding the ancient city, arrived at the square, dismissed the cochero, and sauntered, with swinging canes, down n-among the foun- t tains in front of the Hotel de Tnglaterra. Seats of light iron trellis-vorkr borldered, and prettily dressed children played in, the walks. The sunset gun at Morlo boomed across tile sea: "Are you sufficiently gratefull to Neptune, old boy, for bringing you away from whcrc , those things don't shoot blankl-cartlridges?" "Old Nep had a very equivrocal way of I showin his reard. I was about to think lie loved mne so well he wouldn't give ne up i at all. IIis affection is mucht like that of a - Polar bear. At all events, let's s; sec low dc- vout a quondlam follower of MZars can be in E adoration of whatever divinity controls the e realn of fun and frolic and sight-secin, "- r  i' That's dark-vailed Cotytto . llere, I ex- "pect. -well, let's in here and cool off. Thle   Helados de Paris is famed for the excellence of its wines, the attentiveness of its waiters, and the pretty girls who frequent it." As Vincent spoke, they passed through one room of the brilliant salon, crowded with splendidly robed women and handsomely dressed men, who were laughing, coquctting, gesticulating, and drinking at marble-topped tables.         \ They sat down in a smallIr, less frequent- ed apartment, from whence they could see straight out to the statue of Isabel Serrunda, around whose haughty form the children sported and the fountains sang their mono- tone. "(Here, you infernal little gamin of a llozo!" called Vincent, in mingced English, Spanish, and French, to a white-aproned, pretty boy of about six years. "Give us dos vasos de aguadiente, and the best you've got-the very best; d'3ye hear?" The speaker had stretched out his feet to their full length, and rested his left hand on his cane clinched between his knees, whilo the right, itself leaning on the small table, served the double or alternate purpose of supporting his head and his cigar. He was surprised enough to draw all his limbs in an upright position when the garlon replied, in very good English, The very best wouldl not return the courtesy of your excellency's command. Beso los pies de Vn.! Si, seizor, si " added he in Spanish, as Vincent thrcat- ened with his cane, and ran off to obey. "' You can defend us from the knavery of guides, but you are not a good shield against the insolent repartee .of the waiters-,la, ha!" Wilton burst into laughter, and after a lit- tle his friend joined him, but with much embarrassment. "' These Cubans,' he said, when they were fairly set to wrolrk on the enjoyment of the brandy. and ices with which the active boy loaded their table, "are the- laziest, hand- somest, and most passionate people in the world." "Why, our little attendant here is smart and amiable enough, if that's what you mean-not unhandsome, either." "Oh! he's got some drops of English blood in his veins; no Spaniard can plro- nounce our language as he does." . What's your name, little friend?"Lee asked, as the boy removed an empty glas;   to make room  for two platcs of blushing fresa crema. "Manucl Vincent, para sirbil a Vm.,' re- plied the youngling, bowing and twisling his napkin. "Here's a coincidence for you! At him, Vincent, Junior! Open your arms, Vincent, Senior!   In true vtutdeville, tragi-cometlcta' style, embrace, ye long-separated brothers!" Lee instantly checked his bantering, when he caught sight of Vincent, Senior's, f(Lce. The slight tinge of blush that had first spread out from the florid spots on his checks; now sceemed to curl up like burning parchment, shriveling the rose-petals, and clianging all ,to a lvlvd pawn,  The Gold ejcs ciier- vesced, glealming with unnaturanl blrightness, and a ghastly smile, strange as mirth round the dead, lit the whole expression. Wilton asked if he was ill. Vincent mut- tered that hle was subject to these transient spasms, thought the open air would help him, tossed a doubloon to the stalring boy, and walked out of the salon, followed by his astonished friend. After a very short interval hc saidl he was all right again, apologized  to Wilton for spoiling their "cool off," and draggcl  himn into an opcn  carriagc, ordering the driver, ,^ "Pa/Fde Tacon!" My friads of sparl ling gaslighlts ran  on each side of tils broad drive, and came to- gether in the distance. Pcdestrians, horse- men, volantes, victorias, cabriolets, bugr- gices, vehicles of every nation and fashion, their divers and tigers in fanciful liveries, their prancing horses brightly caparisoned, throngecd between the lamps-, carved about the statue of Tacon, and wisked  through the gates of the palace-garden of the capilan- general.

Leopold Wilton enjoyed it all, and  in a thousand different  sext)essiols testified hiis dclight.   CHAPTER XXVI. I VIOLA DE AGUILAR.   FOLLOW we Leopold Wilton another step in his decadence from the stainless, the "only one," to the conlmmlon! The first stages of the falling off have not been noted. He was himself hardly a-ware then those first charms, those gaudy links of the deathly chain, were thrown about him. "Forewarned, forearmed!'" Unmask Armida, and these are no fascinations! Against the cuirass of purity and omniscient Truth her poisonous arrows are harmless olr only make flesh-wounds.- Being so armed, our patient can not die; but his crisis and convalescence are interesting. What man can perfectly resist these Cir- cean temptations? It were unnatural if even Leopold passed through such flames un- scathed. Now he trembled on the verge; it was, therefore, now that he looked and thought of turning back. Vincent's cold eyes had bound him. He could easily have snapped these fetters; but there came a new Delilah-charm. They frequented now the "LouvreS'-no more the t Helados de Paris." A week was spent in dissipation. Lee noticed that his friend was absent every afternoon at about the same time. Once, looking -across the multitude of forms on the Prado, he saw him enter the saloon- they had lately avoided-the house of Manuel. Half an hour after, he found him stretched on one of the benches which sit back -retiringly among the trees on the Pa- seo of the Queen. He did not disturb him, because, as his face looked upward, Lee saw there, by the tender light-of stars, remains of moisture. Was it of weeping, or only the dew which had dropped from the dreaming palm above him on the cheek-roses of the sleeping youth?   The week passed very rapidly, urged on by the goads of pleasure; masques, opera, cdrives in the country, cards, billiards; music at the "Louvre," at the "Dominica," at eve- ry meal, in the streets; music everywhere but where it should best have been-chant- ing its blessed suggestions in the soul's tem- ples of these young men! Music was, at last, the Hercules-hand to sweep these Augean impurities from the soul of Leopold Wilton. Meanwhile, it was the night of the per- formance of La Traviata. Lee stood in the spacious vestibule of the Gran Teatro de Tacon, and watched, with ever-increasing interest, the crowd that swayed above its marble floor. Newsboys, crying the libretto, vanished and reappeared, dodging through the columns and human forms so rapidly, their little imp- hoods seemed to be omnipresent; the great bell of the proscenium, which knells a death- like stillness through the vast audience, had not yet struck the first time; and the pas- sionate, impulsive Spaniards, every one robed in spotless white and black, kept their long moustachos -restless with their chatting and smiling. Ever and anon, a handsome equipage would dash up and yield its bejeweled freight; the live sea would recede; and sefior, sefiora, and sefiorita, followed by the inevitable Chi- naman attendant, pass with untouched skirts to-the sanctum of their private box. Lee caught sight of one face and form; he could not resist the impulse to follow it. 'Recklessly, and with American rudeness, he thrust aside, threading his way'through, the wavy multitude. Now it vanished away over there in the bewildering maze, reappeared, vanished to   glitter again elsewhere; the banner that led him on was a tremulous sprig of mignon- nette adorning her head. At length, the bearer-a youthful woman, supporting the almost tottering steps of an elderly senora-passing all th entrances to the mlla gnificent boxes, glided into a retired place in the upper gallery. Lee sat down near, to enjoy the reward of his successful chase. What description will do justice to the freshness, the tenderness, the beautiful gitrl- ishness of Viola de Aguilar's face 1 Her soul beamed- out of almond-shaped, black eyes;  breathed mutely from delicately carved nos- trils; uttered itself from glowing lips. Alas! ( that it was simply the soul of girlhood! for the lightness, the airiness, the exquisite seal happiness sets on the brow were wanting.  Was that a furrow? Perhaps only a rip- 1 pie as some unpleasant thought passed through hUr mind-a shade of the cloud swimming over a lawmn.  Her figure was small, slight, and graceful; E dark hair fell on her alabaster neck, As the 1 f shadow of boughs onthrs glassy surface of a 1 stream. Such a- luxury, a perfect fullness 9 and- loveliness of limb and movement, were r shown in every unaffected change of posi- t tion, that Lee resolved there might be as much truth as poetry in the warm descrip- F tions novelists love to give of the persons of s their heroines. His attention was very un- c equally divided between this vision and the h opera. It was only at the exquisite "Adeo" fo of Camille, beautifully rendered by Olivia a Leonia, that the music triumphed, for a timne, a over the fascination of its rival.    ] c   In the intermission preceding the last act, Lee conceived the brilliant idea of sending some ices to the unknown, and was work- ing hard mentally to think what Ca:stilian words he could scribble on a piece of paper, w-hose simplicity and heartiness might in- duce her to partake of refreshments so nlamc- lessly offered, when hle saw his little friend of the Helados approach her with cream and bonbon. His interest was heighltened, if pos- sible, by what followed. Littlc1Ianucl chat- ted gayly with his companions, winning, by his pranks, an occasional smile of tho'tender- est sadness from the senorita; and, finally taking his seat between the ladies, remalined during the performance. The piece was done. Camille expiated her errors with her sweet, penitent lire, and the last echo of the olrchestra was drowned in the noise of the departing crowd. Lee kept near his fascination during the exit, feasted as long as possible on this repast of Cuban beauty, and overheard the seniora ask Manuel if he had been revisited by tihe fit- ful Euglish gentleman, wlo spoke so rooghly, but dropped doubloons instead of reales. The boy's reply was lost to Lee, when the party, having gained the street, vanished in the shadows of the crowtd.  He felt very dismal with the first disap- pearance of the vision, but comforted hiim- self with the reflection that he had still a certain clue in the person of Manuel; and he went home to dream a beautiful history for this humble girl, which historic Clateau d'Espagne could not be orginated by him and not be hung with the defect-hiding creepers of Romance and Poetry.   CHAPTER XXVII. THE HOME OF THE BETRAYED, ABOVE THE CAFE.   WILTON rose early on the following morn- i ing, performed his toilet without disturbing E Vincent, and walked up to the Prado. Ma- I nuel's. ready smile received him at the cafe, and a "L Que hermosa manc a-Fine morning, i senor!" accompanied his glass of brandy ] and soda.                1 "Wh at excellent company was that I saw you with last night, Ning AIanuel?"  "Only sefora and Viola. I live with se-  fiora and Viola, and Senor Soto lets lme  Carry them cream to the opera one evening  in every week. Did your excellency enjoy Laz Traviata? But then La Opera is a thou- sand times poorer here than in London and New-York, Viola says. Have they time to sing en opera and fight too in New-York? Viva la Confederaciont!' Thus the sprightly boy went on, until Lee checked his flow of child-prattle by forcingI him to join himself in some Iimonada which drink is nowhere so well prepared as in this land of fruits and flowers. Lee explained that he was a Confederado; that New-Yorkr was not-ostensibly at least; and that the -desolation of war had not surged up far enough North yet to interfere with the performances of "Faretzek. Manuel's throat swallowed his lemonade naturally enough, the two being well ac- quainted; but his mind was evidently a stranger to geography, and strenuously re- fused the. idea-thus tendered-the idea that there could be any war in the United States whose hot breath did not extend its baleful influence to New-York. - The child's under- standing of the whole matter seemed to be: New-Orleans and New-York were tne capi- tals of two shadowy portions of the United States; he heard continually of the Yankee General Butler at New-Orleans; therefore, New-York must be Confederado. Wilton finished his soda and was depart-   ing, when Manuel pressed him to come and see senora and Viola-they would -be, so happy to talk of La Confederacion. Lee. promised to come up in the evening, if they wished it, and, with many polite ex- pressions from his juvenile friend, went back to breakfast. Tile day passed as its predecessors, and, faithful to his appointment, Wilton arrived at the salon under the Fonzdca de Inglatcerra. Manuel met him with a manner prompted by the genuine caste-leveling impulse of his child's nature, seized his hand, and led him up by a winding flight of steps, round land- irngs which were but extensions of flower- plats, along a gallery that overhung a spa- cious quadrangular garden, until, arriving at a little room which, being entered from the portico, also looked out toward the sea, helinvited him to sit down. Lee did no such thing but walked about the little apartment to examine the pictures on the walls. In one of these, entitled El Castigo de Dies, Brian de Bois Guilbert fell on the bloodless plain, struck by the harmless lance of Ivan- hoe-stricken inwardly by the bolt his own passion forged for the Jove-hand of heaven. In another, foolish, witty Wamba, with shield of brawn, thrust the silver-bearded Jew idown the steps of the lists, and the crowd, heedless of the Israelite's ag e, or of Rebecca's blushes, hails, with irreverent applause, the downfall of Isaac. Another picture, apparently a crayon sketch, presented a beautiful womnan sing- ing and thrumming the guitar, while a hand- some senor, with the look of a star-gazer, plays the listener at her feet. From the ear- nestness of his attention to those starry orbs, it is plain that, as the artist has been unable to express the voice and the music, so the caballero is utterly deaf to these, and is   moved by the mute eloquence of two eyes, which look down into his with the tender- ness of the mildest estrella. Another sketch produced a tract of sea- shore, comforted by no sign of life, by no idea of life, except that lofty mountains in the distance sloped down to it gradually, un- til, having reached the brink of the ocean, they stooped to drink of the wave dashed at their feet. These thoughts of mountains and "deep- -reddened kinc," and " knee-deep in clover- blooms," and the vast meadow of a conti- nent on which the cattle-hills should never weary of grazing-and who knows what things may happen at the nightfall of the nest century?--and-what a mournful heart must have guided the hand that held this pen- cil, were still rushing confusedly thhrough Lee's mind, when the twro ladies, summloned by Manuel, appeared, the elder still leaning on Viola's arm. In tolelrably good, but very tremnulous English, Seniora De Aguilar greeted Leopold, "Good afternoon, sir;" and that youngil gen- tleman thought hhe had never seen any tling half so pretty as the miingling of modesty and dignity with whch Viola thanked hll for his attention to Manuel's reqluest. ' It is not an idle curiosity, selor, which makes us grateful to your kinldness and the Nino's thoughtfulness. Scefiora has an onlyr son whlomn she would inquire of. You know, seflor, on what small. ground our hearts will build a hope." "My   son! miy son!" faltered the aged woman, seizing Leopold's hand and gazing in his face with the earnest look of childhoodl- the beseeching look of age-"kiow you any thing of my son?  The Yankees, you call them?  He could not be with the Yankees. Ie was ifrom Newr-Orleans." "But senor must know his name, madlre mnia, ancld .e wtill be delighted to iearn his," said Viola, with a mournful smile. 'Call you ever have met or heard of Rupert -La- roux?' "Leopold Wilton, nara sir7bir ca T m, who is very unhappy that he can not tell you any thing certain of the lost one. Excuse me, but Georgia and Louisiana are too far separate to have made in the army any ac- quaintance but that of the merest chance." Lee said this with a good deal of Imbar-   rassment, the result of many conflicting emio- tions-the desire to excuse his small attempt at Spanish, and the somewhat discourteous impeachment of their knowledge of his coun- try; the tenderness of a universal free-ma- sonry felt by a young lman, looking, even for the first time, into the eyes of a beautiful girl; and the sympathy wit w hich he Rw the tears gather rapidly in the eves of the sellora, as, relinquishing his hand, she real- ized the still-birth of her hope, and retired to flowl; her grief in the ilcnco of her own apartment. A young woman is seldom wanting iln resources unlder any circumstallces ; in mat- ters of courtesy and love she is a Napoleon for concluding- and acting. Viola immediately relieved the awkward- ness of these moments by clhiling Malnucl's neglect -in not bringing up some refreshment for their guest. "What a beautiful prospect of the occan friom your window!" exclaimed Wilton. "Yes, like the bride of the hoary Adri- atic, Cuba is the esI)osa of this wild Southern sea." "Rather a blooming daughter, with its warm passion, its teeiming luxuriance, balmy moonlights, its flowers and music, and maid- ens, it seems to me a Venus Aphrodite and the mother of love." "It is very dangerous; selor, brlide or daughter.  Its love is as warim as its tropic breath, as beautiful as its flowery spring, as fitfully calm or vengeful as the treacherous sea.  Evrcly careless man should bcneware of our Castilian love." '"Then he should beware of Havana; for the wiclked  god's missiles arlc flying all about."' "The deity is in league, I thllnk, ith cvery beam of the sun; the very air is-passionate; it wTill throb agrrainst yTour chlleek, in the after- noons, lile a woman's hcart.." So low had L-copold Wilton sunlk, hle was on the point of getting offra pun- "Ary wo- man's heart," cltc.-when he reflected that Viola was utterly ignorant of the lingo of ans Amnerican baclkwoo(dsman. "'Thle Cubans,' lhe saidl, "must know notlhing of the higher Iphilosophies of Love, as they can not shake off his silken tranmmels and clutch the little fellow by the throat." "Such a triumph is impossible. Yes I   To be able to analyse the passion requires such a merciless frame of mind! The inha- bitants of your country may get cold enough for that; these animated bubbles of sea-foam find it impossible to reason out of such en- tanglements. Their only solution is-" "Instead of reason the stiletto and life- blood!" "4Si, sellorl And -should it not be so? What is love worth if it can be rented out like a costupne at the Ballo in M aschera. if, like a ;taravedi, it pass from hand to hand? Oh! it would become soiled; a por- tion of its beauty and purity remains with every palm which it touches." "Your deity, senorita, should be painted a shriveled old miser, sitting on his strong box of Love's wares, eye-glances, kisses, and honey words. To what gloomy shades you would banish our cooler clime's spendthrift Eros!" "To exile from our further consideration for the present," answered Viola with hearti- ness. "Permit me, Senor Wilton, to with- draw from a contest wherein, the more bravely Hflaunt my banner, the more I am liable to diminish the respect of my adver- sary. -You are here to see for yourself. You will "   Manuel here interrupted, by requiring, with a child's imperiousness, the assistance of Viola in placing before Wilton strawherry sherbet, wafers, and water in frozen decan- ters. The face of Viola-which, during the con- versation, had now and then been alight, as with the cheeriest sunbeam-now resumed its- sad expression again, the cloud-incense  rising from an ever-burning sacrifice- in -her heart. Lee, perceiving what she would have asked, began to speak of his native land, its beauties and its sorrows, its pastjoy and its present desolation, its heroism and its hope. - In this the reader can not feel even the interest he may have granted to the other portions of this chapter; for, alas! the only beauties here now are our sorrowing maidens strewing flowers on the tomb of slain hero- ism; the joy of peace is black-vailed with a desolation worse than war; and hope is well- nigh shriveled to despair. Wilton took his leave, with a kind invita- tion from Viola, and a thousand pressing entreaties from Manuel, to come again to- morrow.   CHAPTER XXVIII. - S A T U It N A L' I A AND M ASS.   ONE hour in every day, usually the twi- light, so delightful in this climate, was passed by Wilton at the house of Viola. Unfortu- nately, several hours were abandoned to the license of his gay companions. Want of decision; the fear of a derisive smile from those coldly glittering eyes; the excitement of company, of being popular, of hilarity so pleasant to one who .has all -his life lived introspectively, tnade hiIn yield his better nature inch by inch. A little sophistry di- minished the extent of every concession. When we are tempted, what specious arlgu- ments will vail the hideous Alokanna, and win devotion and worship when should have been rendered only contempt and scorn! "WAlhat shall it be this evening, Wilton, Rigolette or the French theatre " "The opera, by all means," replied the party addressed, as he pulled on his coat, adjusted his hlat on highly perfumed locks, seized his cane, and followed Vincent through the marble entrance of the Hotel de Europa late one afternoon; "I wouldn't give one eloquent burst of MaIzzoleni for all the melo- dralna in the world. Does any thing ever siovs you, you cold -combination of steel, and ilalblc, and ice, and all frigidity? I mean in the way of eloquence, music, moon- liglt, etc." "These are excellent things, Wilton, for boys andt young women. Give me the dice- its noble suspense, its hope and fear, the assurance that victory will follow caution and skill-and I'll talk to you. This is the only passion for men." I There was a time when, at the utterance of such a sentiment, Leopold Wilton would have shuddered as if he had suddenly found his coffee filled with reeking poison; when his moral self would have turned on its heel na we recoil from the abrupt brink of a pre-   cipice; when he would have felt the same loathing for the utterer men feel for the venom in their path. It was not apparent that any such emotion occurred to hm now, as be continued the conversation by aslking, "Is there any exhibition at the 'T'auro soon? "I don't know. But then there's no fun or respectability in the Cuban bull-fight. These people are so greatly degenerated, they use dogs instead of the knightly mata- dor-bah!" "I think the Cubans ought rather to be credited with an advance in civilization. I suppose none now but a low class go to wit- ness the miserable show. It must liave be- come like the prize-ring of your country and the cock-pit of the West.. Surely no ladies attend!" "Ah! there are few, I suspect, who- do do not wish to. The ladies-that is, the youthful-ones-of Havana enjoy very little free agency. Distrust peeps out front every rule of their conduct; and you know there's no better way to make a woman's passion willful than by opposition or want of conf- dence. Restraint only increases the mys- terjn al  ces that seem worthy of every sacrifice which might be disdained the mo- ment it were known. The difference of Montague and Capulet only feeds the flame of Romeo and Juliet." "HHear, hear, the modern reformer of du- ennas!  I shall next sec imperial cham- pagne dethroned by democratic vinegar-cla- ret. In the pocket of thy coat (of/arms and of cassimere) replace thy pack of divine cards with some symbol of professional spctaclecy!" "Install me domine, young man, and I shall not be slow to anger, being therein exactly like  most of Learning's ictors. Thou sorely need'st the ferule for truancy.   Then, palmanm qufi nzeruit ferat, Wihy,' lately, thou dost eschew billiards, and wine, anld womlen-wromen, did I say? I shrewdlj suspect some one potency hath chained thee to her merciless chalriot. AMy -neophyte  who hadst alreadyv watched several times in the temple of Faro, and wert becoming full- fledged-thou'rt a false knight, so soon to turn back from deeds of errantry!" "Lord save us!  I'm  getting familiar enough with znig7ts-errant, I reckon. Al well! Vincent, w-e'll go to the Rooms to- night. The Wren sails in a few days, and- " "And Virginia trenches in prospect give a wondrfull zest to Havana luxuries-ay? Wilton, let me advise you, beware of Cuban women; they clasp you with love in one arm and hate in the otherl." Lee fancied that he healrd a low grinding of teeth, anid he iclooked up at his companrlon, to tulrn hIis face awan-y with pain at the pre- ternatural glitter of the serpent-eyes-at tile marble paleness of the cheeks, flowelrless and stained now, in place of their roses, with two spots like blood. The two passed by the childish innocence at play among the fountains, and entelredl the opera-house. Here there is plenty of anmusenmet and little inclination to talk; for the scenery and music to be found by peep- in, through the lattice of the gallceriedl boxes, during the intermission, is nearly as popular as that made and displayed on the stage. After the performance Tilton and Vin- cent adjourned to -where billiard, dolminno, and card tables, anong magnificent frllniture and ref reshments, spring their daintily-dlis- guised pitfalls to all the numerous upwary. Tincent was soon " in deep." ice in- vested pirudlently at first, smiling as the lit- tle lpiles werle swept firom his sight. Tlhell came the excitement; the glaring light; the heated air, heavy with odors of liquor; tile burning-passion; the crowd-all fever thle brain and body of amniateur and professional. WAilton had laid away, from the sum re- ceived at Bermuda, three pieces of goldl, wherewith to purchase some delicate present for Alice. All but that had now vanisled; his money takes wings with the honesty, the virtue, the purity of him who games. Slowly the first of the golden eagles de-   voted to her was withdrawn from the nest near his heart and placed on the table. It flew anway. The second . . . How singularly the pieces seem linked together by an irnvisi- ble chain, and steadily follow in the deadly wake! So follow each other fault, error, crime, sin, death. The third piece is divided and one half rksked. It wins; another wins. Another and another time success; his own, and double his own money, it is tripled and qualdrupled. He continues, with fortune va- rying, but ever leaning on his side. He is bewildered with the amount that glitters -from his double palms. Poor'Vincent! The profits of months of perilous blockade-running are all sunk in these quiclksands. Amiply, has retribution w-rought its vengeance on this miserable soul. Fate is against him. The wickedness he worships is his lruin; as a poisonous spi- der it s-tings him. Lee misses himll and makes a partial search throuh the smoke and heat, the ,passion- seethed atmosphere of this hell. He is fasci- nated and continues his horrible success. ,Now the wealth is his.  Now he sees scores of yellow pieces torn firomn his hungry clutch. From side to side flows the golden current; there wouldl be little harlm. if it only passed across the tables and human palms. Alas! it is accompanied by a ghastly coun- terpart-a shadowy, scoriac, river, which rushes over the peaceful stream of-virtue, scorcihes up its spriingi, and shrivels the fair- est growtlis of the soul. Now above the head of Wilton flutters the visionary eagle of gain; no\- it perches on the standard of the other party to this demoniac contest. At last the game ceases, the. madmen separate, and he seeks his rootm wilth stilained nerves and dizzy Lbrain. Reaching the open air, he realizes that it is dawn, that all night he has lkept up the fearful bacchanalia. The fresh, dewy air recalls his sense and cools his frame, relaxescs the mental tension, and brings calm thought. IIis eyes drop to the ground; his mental vision turns in on him- self, and his hands fall to hris side. What was that they touched? AMore than a scolre of hard gold coins. God! how they burn I Has a fiery spark kindled-.in every'piece?   Through his quickening pulse, to his heart, to his brain, runs the sharp agony of re- morse. What untold treasures would he not give for the small, pale jewel of purity, of former innocence! Oh! that it were a dream, a horrible nightmare! that the irrevocable hoar-frost of guilt were not, in terrible reali- ty, fallen upon his young soul! L What hands are here! Ha i they pluck out mine eyes! Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hands? No! this my hand will rather The nmulttudinous seas incarnadlne, Making the green one red. . . Walke Duncan with thy 'knocking! I would thou COuldSt." The great monotone of the church-bell, calling to mass, clangs out above the waking town, across the rising sea; lknclls the doom of memory into his soul; surges up the re- sistless tide, and leaves upon the barren sand the poor wrecks of his hope and his love, his rectitude, his golden aspirations, his religion. Miserable is he who strives to quench the fiery consciousness of sin with the Lethe of imore fiery wine! Lee had entered the "Dominica" saloon; a few drinks would   smooth  his memory clear, as a Roman erased the stylus writing on his waxen tablet; would turn pain to joy, sin to virtue, regret to exhilaration; would so idealize the world to his clogged sense, all the misery of years congealing to a single tear, that would glitter as a dew-drop with a rainbow in its breast, and freshen to a smile. Something made him   turn upon his heel. "Burn till you consume, damned, parching throat! I'll sink-my soul no deep-cr, if my body die!" said the fallen- youth, and con- tinued to walk aimlessly, turning downn, the water-side. He thought him of those whose happiness was in his brightness, whose joy rested in his hope; of helr, "Elaine the fair, Elaine the lovablc, Elaine the lily-maid' to him, O most unworthy   Launcelot!-of her who guarded the sacred shield of his purity, broi- dering on it the purple of her sweet, loving confidence, and addiing "Of her wit a border-fantasy of branch and flower, And yellow-throated nestling in the nest; Nor rested thus content, but day by day, Leaving her household and good father, climbed That eastern tower, and entering barred the door, Stript off the case and read the naked shield, Now guessed a hidden meaning in his arms, Now made a pretty history to herself   Of every dint a sword had beaten in it, And e\very scratch a lance had mcade upon it, Conjedturing when and where: this cut iEa fresh; That t&n, years back: tis dealt himt at Carlylc; Tllat at Cacrlon; that at Camelot.

And he thought of that last night, months ago, when toethler they sat under tho silent stars, her hand linked in his it was not scorchedl thon- their hearts fillcedL with the unutterable still gladness of love, their minds awed with the holiness of night; and, under hcaven, they were pledgedl to each other.

Almost reeling with his, bewilderingl enio- tions Lee passed up the steps of the catlthe- dral, and leaned against a lpillar away back at its end. HeI-re and thelre a worshipcr, vailced and robed in black, kneeled on the cool pavement with bowed head and clasped lI(ands. Far across the holy atmosphere tapers dimly burned about the altar, and the priests movcd in restless, solemnin ceremonial in the light and sihadow. As the gentle nighllt-wind across the sum- mer-sca, a low, wailing breath of sound float. ed from the roof along the urns, and tombls, and  " sculptured mionumnents of saints;" then, slowly swelling, the pious strain vo-" lumes to a full diapason of unearthlly gran. deur, and again falls, a sweet, penitent tone, striving to reach the heaven-like roof, "So high that, like a weak and doubting praye- Ere it can float to the carved angels there, The silver-cloudedl incense faints ln air!"   Poor Wilton! All his manliness was as nothing in this melting of the frozen spirit, in this actual discovery of the new world he had hitherto only known in vague dreams. He bowed his head on-a slab near him-the last commemoration of Christopher Colon- and wept. s    While the great organ ov'er all (did) roll, Speaking strange secrets to his (penitent) soul, Bearing on eagle-wings the great desire Of all the kneeling throng, and piercing higher Than aught but love and prayer can reach, until Only the silence seemed to listen still; Or gathering like a sea still more and more, Break in melodious waves at heaven's door, And then full slow and soft in tender rain, Upon the'pleading, longing hearts again."   CHAPTER XXIX. VIOLA'S. STORY.   WILTON1 returned to his lodgings deter- mined to implore Vincent to leave off -his fatal amusement and accompany him where his voluntary service in the field would both benefit himself and 'assist a straitened people.        I Vincent was not there. His luggage was gone. Inquiries developed that, just before dawn, he had come. for his effects and had removed them, after settling his account, no one knew whither.  Lee was too tired to search for him, and threw himself on his canvas couch to sleep. When he awoke at noon, such a terrible pain in his head and weariness in his limbs afflicted him that he could hardly stir. A siclkly clamminess matted his hair to his brow, and the fierce steed of illness, with his helpless Mazoppa, Reason, bound  to its back, coursed madly through his veins. He was very sick; for many hours he was delirious. On the -second day Emanuel came to see what had become of him. His presence was as a sunbeam to the dreary thoughts of the sick man. "AhI senor, we looked for you all day yesterday; and when Viola said you must have gone back to fight the Yankees, I cried because I was afraid they might kill you. And, senfor, there's a New-York ship come in the harbor this morning. I saw her great long guns from the Pescado Vivo; but you are sick now, and I am sure that the capi- tan-general will not let them hurt you here." He was amused and comforted by this in- nocent talk, and followed with eyes whose sparkle was not wholly from   fever little Alanuel's mnovements about the room as he strove to do every thing possible for the case of his friend. Once or twice a day Viola sent down cool drinks for his refreshment.   Was it love for this beautiful Spans- American filled his heart? He smiles now and says it was, when lie wishes to tease a certain lady who sits at hs feet. Madam, the certain lady, loolks very grave and a little troubled; and then tOic beard of the young man and the blue ribbon about the collar of the young lady suddenly clasp each other and go off in. a half waltz, half minuet, of which the music is this mur- mur: 'But know you, darling, there are very many tender attachnlen s may ensconce themselves in out-of-the-way niches of a man's heart, and still leave him free to the grand worship of the one statue above the altalr!" . . . In less than a week Wilton was convales- cent. ;When the seven diurnal revolutions were complete, he ventured one evening to the Prado. How different every thing seemed to him! Before, even innocent pleasures were only half enjoyed; now, with the serenity of an  untroubled mind, with the callllncss of a subdued heart, he witnessed the lively scenes about the popular square, and only longed, to complete his happiness, for the presence of those whose ears were, perhaps now, stunned with the noises of battle, whose hearts were pierced with suspense as to the fate of his unworthy self. He sat in the little window  with Viola, and listened to the music of the magnificent band which, grouped about thei marble inl- age of Isabel Segunda, played selections from   Traviata, Enanic and the glorious Miserere of Trovatore. le had abandoned all idea of. seeing Vin- cent again, and  he rejoiced that ho las separated from one whose character hle felt to be radically deficient in the primary elc- ments of rectitude.  Viola's .conversation, he fancied} assumed   even a more than usually mournful tone. At times a fierceness,-like ligrrhtning along the dlark of a summer cloud, would flash through the sadness which was the prevailing tinge of all her thought. - A struggle seemed always to go on in her spirit, and not unfrequently the wild -banditti of some deep grief infest-. ing her heart enjoyed a short-lived triumph over the sweet amiability which was the law. "Anmio mio," she said, "I have been so happy and foolish picturing myself in your southern home with that Marian you have told me of, and that Alice whomn you must love as I thought I was loved once." "Then conme with me, Viola!" No, no! there is no place for my dark- ened heart in- that happiness. A deadly poison would be planted among your inno- cent flowers. Here, here where I was once as happy as the freest bird, in the lonely centre of this thronging city, unknown among the busy crowd, unnoticed I live: unwept, save by -Manuel and mi Magire po- bretona, I would die." "Y:ou do wrong, senorita, to yield to these gloomy impressions. Hecate has so many witches in her train, and the weird sisters seldom visit singly our despair. Evil dreams and presentiments bring up ghostly unreali- ties to vex us. The very moon, chaste and beautiful, is made to shed a vaporous drop which sours all our joy." "' One can not help such dreams, I think. Guilt is the true Hecate, and all the miseries follow in her train." "Ah! thou fairy! stop talking like a witch, else I'll think myself Mtacheth, and call the unknown powrers. Lately, when I tossed restlessly in the still watches of the night, such fearful visions hooted raven-warnings in my miserable sleep! such furies came to lash me for my sin! I deserved it all. Are not our dreams a reward or punishment for sweet or wicked thoughts, for faith orb no faith? Can the waking eye be fixed on that shining temple of the sun, if, in dreams, it sees the seething smoke of Tartarus? Does the ear catch any echo of the seraph's song,0 if, dreaming, it hears only foul discords?" "But you are well now. The very excel- lence of your moral and physical constitu- tion has brought you health again. SMy   malady, Selnor Wilton, can be cured only by vengeance." The lightnings flashed through the cloud, and the wild banditti sprang to renew the struggle. "Did you not promise to tell me sow-e- thing of this dreary past, Viola? Nowe, as the last gleam of the fleeing day's chariot- wheel sparkles in the west, tell me what steals the buoyancy from your step and ,drives your w#-,ole life to a penlance?" "I will, senor. You sail in a fewr days for the camp.  Perhaps-ah! God grant that you miht .meet him in fair battle and reach his- foul heart with your mortal wea- pon! But no, no! What- chance is there; what right that you, gentle anmigo, you whose heart is full of peaceful joy at being another's, that you should stain your hand with the blood of one so base! I watch ancd wait here. If heaven shall ever put him in reach of my frail arm, I shall strike with an assurance that the same omnipotence will nerve it for the avenging stroke. "Your patience, seior  "I first breathed this atmosphere. The large casa just this side of the Plaza de Ar- mas-.was my birthplace. My young eyes opened to wealth and all its luxurious sur- roundings. Senior Don Raphael de Aguilar was a patrician whose veins throbbed with the rich, passionate blood of Castile. How well I remember his caresses, his romps with me, his dark eyes so tender that his fierce mustaches ceased to have any terrors for my timorous infancy! . Alas! I was hardly as old as MaInuel when I missed his gentle smile and noticed the dreary ceremony of death, which I after knew to be the last honors the world should pay to the noble hidalgo. "Children are not as constant as animals. A poor dog refuses the miserable boon of life when his master's touch no longer thrills him. I soon learned to find joy in the so- ciety of the playmates left to me. The prin- cipal of these was my brother Rupert. He did not remain long enough with me, though, to win much affection. " My mother was married late in life. She was now more than thirty years of age, when she was induced to place her jeweled widow's hand in that of a man whose cha.   racter must have been the very reverse of Senior dc Aguilar's.  1Wew rent to New Orleans. In two years we returned here; but the miagnificent house near the Plaza did not receive us againl. My new father and Pupert remained in New- Orleans; I and my mother were alolne in this small suite of apartmcnts. I noticedc that scnora no longer wore her jewels; the grand robes which had rustled like a queen's over the Inarble pavements of my birth- palace wrelre replaced by the simplest attire. "I could not tell by what agency this great change was brought about. My plas- tic youth accustomel itself to poverty as easily as it had to wealth, and I was conternit. Every evening after dusk I was allowed to play among the trees of the Paseo. "I never did any work, except occasion- ally to assist nly mother to make the artifi- cial flowers which were our partial support. Only when she was sick I used to carry theni- down to the Calle de Obrapia, and bring hbac the few pieces of gold they read- ily obtained. "O1 O  day-I was about fifteen-the acci- dent occurred which nearly deprived me of life, and introducecd me to hiMm. "O miserable life! 'T-ould have been honorblec to die so; for honor died with nlmy rescue firom death, with this fresh impulse of wretched life which slew my purity and my Joy-. "As I came quickly out of the crowded sales-1room of'La Gloria,-ly foot slipped on the blrink of the narrow pavement, and I fell with such force I was illsensible. A cab, wrhich was then driven furiously by, w^as stopped ere its heavy wheels would have crushed me not before it Tightened horses, unable to check so suddenly their impetu- ous speed, had tramplecd me. He drew me at once from beneath their plunging forms, learned from the merchant mly abode, and conveyed me home. "I was not fatally injured, and very soon recovelred. lHe nursed me, read to me, amused me, sang to me, said in most pas- sionate, poetic wo-ords lie loved me. I was but fifteen, seflor: what wonder that I was totally blind to the venom hidl anong these flowers? "All love is itself an odorous juice that   paints in its own brighlt colors thhe belo(vedt object. y?/ di m)i! TIllnapDDy love which maslcked so muuclh cunning, so mu51 ck clldne's1, so mnuch wIorld-wisdomo I a-S iiniie ; \\whlli(cl COUIL make a hero of such foulness! "thheC long twilights we usedl to wander among the, shnhadowsnr  of this belatliful pr1lo011,- nade, lounge in all the listlessIlness of saltis- fied love about the nymplll anud triithn- shapcd fountains, and gaze firom this ,very window across the sleepling sea.

"At these timHe he spoke to He of love, stole his arm tenderly about tlic lIappy Viola, swore passionate vows to the unsiIs- pecting girl, drew me, all a.-llae \vitli ;yongr affection, close to his wickeld hearlt.  Monlths were passed in tis dreanim of bll ss. He gainedl the consent of y ImottherI, and a dal;ly was appointcd for the clrcloniy-how 'little I cared for the simple follml!-whllich wouldl unite us in the eyces of the world, whllo were already bound by what I thought an indis- soluble chain of love. 'Nothing could surpass my happiness; not a thing caine to cloud my joy. "He was rich, he saidL; -would talCke nc for a the to ierrie Englaind; aiid, hY1avin1 sen1 that big world of fashion anld -trade, we would return, get n house like Scnor dle Amuilar's, and live in HHavnna, lappy in its flowers and gayety and soft clime, in tilC sun- shi nellc of our own loviln healrts. "Onoe night I told lim -holy MTary I what unutterable pride swellcd mny licart lwhen I whispered to hinm-that a heaven-sent inno- cent would soon coleC to claim from himl a portion of that treasure of affection lie pouredl without rescrve on me. I smfled, breathing an prayer-'twas wicked love -to be coupled ih such sweet jealousy-tlhat lie would not love it even a thousaLndl tilmes less than hle did me.   "He heard me with cold exultation, and soon quitted my presence to write to his dis- tant home. I did not see him for twenty- four hours again. "Gradually the intervals between his so much enjoyed visits increased. "Oh! it was a long time before I realized, before I wrung the consent of my own rea- son to admit that he was growing cold. The water in that taper vessel at your side, senor, will melt in a few seconds; but it takes hours to congeal. "Over a week dragged on, and he did not comne. "Then I ran to meet him, to throw my arms about him as I was wont. "He pushed me off. "I knelt at his feet, and implored him for his own sake, for mine, for the honor of my dead father, in behalf of heaven and its angel that would ere long be given us, to come with me to the altar. Ah God! he cursed me, turned from me, spurned my fainting body with his heel. I have prayed that my bitter daily curses might rain in fiery vengeance on his head! ,Most righte- ous, most just avenging Heaven! wilt thou not-" Lee caught the frail figure in his arms, and strove to soothe with voice and touch. A wild gleam of madness darted from her strained eyes, transforming the gentle woman into a frantic mood; then the violence yielded to the reaction following in the wake of all excitement, and became a less dangerous more demonstrative outhurst of the deepest grief. "Let me complete the sad relations Viola continued; "it is pleasant to release this   wild sorrow that has smouldered so long. My heart would burst but for your sympa- thy. "I lived, as some plants live when their stalks are cut, as men still exist in the blackest fens of vice and despair, as a bird breathes its low song though deprived of its glorious wings and doomed to hobble on the earth. Would that the sword-llke, sudden griefs which lop off our sinking hope might also deprive us of life! " Life was still left me. But for Manuel and seiora I would be wicked enough to hurl this poor boon back to the most inerci- ful Providence. If I knew that he was happy with no other, that his absence from me created of this beautiful earlth a fit abode for such Abaddon, I could die. I pray to meet and bless him yonder when his eyes shall open to his own deformity, and-per- haps the wonderful olrdeal of omnipotent God May purify him once more. "I lived, but a blank like night fell upon me, fortunately, after Caring Manuel had re- ceived his life. "Of that shadowy interval, of those dread visions which for many months rolled in ever angrier surges over nmy shattered mind; of those months in whose calm there was no peace, in whose storm there was nalughllt but ,the terrible, I can not speak. ' At last came the dawn. I was able to *clasp my child to my withered, but, to him, still lovLng heart. '"T'l'hey told me the name of his father hadl been printed with holy water on hs fair forehead. He was christened. Manutel Vin- cent."   CHAPTER XXX. PAITH IN GOD S13 A STAB THAT CAMN hOT BB OBSCURED.   FRIEND, if you are not already weary with unwrapping this modest bundle of memoirs, confined by its plaited strong of narrative, descriptive and moral, let us, however loth, yet, in order to advance, quit this CubLa- Aphrodite, whose every breath is perfumed, every utterance beautiful as the murmur that "springs from the growing of trees," and, traveling v'estward, rejoin the party of our acquaintances, which the eruption of war has shaken together at Al-- . Your best guide is, as usual, he who has led you so far with his invisible clue. If you go without him, you are very apt to be cast on one of those, rcefs which strike out their jagg ed fangs along this dangerous coast, or get lost in a Florida. swamp, where your only sustenance will be a few miserable snails. If you accompany Leopold W ilton, you will have a perilous voyage across the Mexican Gulf, and more than a thousand nmiles of weary overland. Perhaps you will not get therle -at all. Here! I don't encumber you with seven- league boots, or lash you in the basket of a balloon, the breaking of whose smallest thread would metamorphose you illto a fish- tailed merman; I do not even wrap you in.'a smothering cloak of invisibility-still worse, mount you in, that exceedingly ungraceful position of astride Abaris' arlrow. A few black drops front this feather-tipped wand, and, while we talk, we are with AIa- rian Laroux, in- a small apartment, sevcrnal hundred miles from Havana. It is an April mnidnight. No more do the winter-blanched trees stretch forth their ghostly- arms in the cold air. As faith lifts off the burden from a bowed heart, and smooths the sin-furrowed brow, spring dim- ples into smiles the face of kindly nature. No mnore do frozen dews frost the heads of the children of want, and fall in pitiless snow   upon their shivering limbs.  Back to icy kennels in the north, grim winter calls hiis howling dogs, and a fairy spell shuts up their hail-dripping jaws. Life, heat, joy. They drop from bursting buds, float up from blooming violets, sprcad in waves of melody from the trcmlbliig throats of birds; the very stars cease their wintry stare and look tenderly down upon the birllth of the blue-cyed infant spring. Marian is striving to enjoy a small portion of this largesse of balm sovereign nature bestows upon the world, and leans on the ledge of her open window. In the room the gas is turned low, and siheds a Imellow radi- ancec on the objects about lher. I-ow longz she has been cnvironed with the gloom of twilight! As the enllgines of war O        O havc torn the fair bosom of her fathcerland, affliction has made slow her lithe step, plowed hollows in check and heart. She lollngrs to walk, as of yore, in the brighlltncss tlat is abroad over the land-to treadl, with the proud feet of buoyant girlhoodt, the neow- awalkc-ncd earth. For malny wceks her dis- ease had locked her in the sick atmosphere of her apartmcnt. It; will not quit its vul- ture-clutch, but remains, gnawin, itself at intervals to only temporary sathety.  Wo- manl-Prorlletheus? Seldom is the talon of physical mnalady wanting when the chains of unrcturncd love bind thee on the parched rock! So long Marian has waited, prayced, trust- ed! Wearily she -has paced the few feet of space which are an invalid's kingdom, until tired in limb, sick in frame and spirit, exhaus- tion produced feverish sleep. In spite of the tenderness that, from every member of the household, is lavisled on her, she can not endure the thought of absolute dependence, and keeps up a show of her tu- torial duties. The youngest child, a fragile   boy of five or six years, comes daily to prat- tle a simple lesson in her ear. Seldom now did mlidnight find her conm- posed to rest. It was useless to lie down; she- could not sleep. If she did, visions of a chlulchyard, with one large grave in it, came to ves and counterfeit rest. To-niglt, as on other nights, she sat at her casement, looking listlessly into the starry eyes of Godl. Through what a fearful grief of doubt does she now pass! Will not a merciful Father roll back the waters into Red Sea walls, and save her from the memory she flies? Is not the martyred Saviour of sinners the Comforter also of martyred innocents? Must- the consulnling canker of unloved love have unchecked course?  Shall the barbed point of disappointed hope rankle till it fester to despair? Is there no inherent quality of the human soul as noble as that of the lowly mussei, which closes the wound of the sea-worm with a pearl? The joy of those who, loving for the first time, know also the heaven of being loved, is only surpassed by -the misery of those wretched. Marian -had ceased to expect a discovery of her parentage; she had not ceased to mourn the " setting of her great hope," which went down, many months past, over the grave of Rupert Laroux. Since that dreary evening when the crys- tal vase of hope had been shattered to a thousand shards, she had yielded, inch by inch, her tenure of life, driven slowly from the vantagRe-ground of robust girlhood. Dr. Hurt exerted all the kindness of a physician-friend in alleviating her suffering. His wife was constantly in attendance; all Mwere lavish in acts of love. These things were very grateful to the invalid, and came continually to soothe ad comfort her. It was at night that the sharp-beaked vulture satisfied its craving on her chained vitality. NTow memory restored the time :when she was a thoughtless girl, happy as a child with all the toys the love-times of her guardian heaped around her, grieving with only the child's April-like grief when his sunshine seemed no more to shine upon her.   Then, she wolke up to the dreary road ahead of her, to the involuntary disposition attempted of her affection, to the low-mnind- cdncss of her cousin, to those fearful guesses regarding herself and her miother, whose faice was as vague as those dreams which whis- pered of an anterior life. She thought of her life in the whirlpool of the stage; of the vice that, like the dank dews of a prison-vault, trickles down the walls-of the green-room; of the long nights in crowded halls, which wore off the health from her frame and the purity from her mind. Last, having been transplanted to the gar- den of Lucy's home, she was almost happy when, once more-forever now, perhaps- the air was drawn from her and fthe shadow fell upon her like a winter-night. O God! pour out the balm of thy healing faith -on these sore wounds, and teach us that sorrow is man's progress to a greater perfection!  If she could only penetrate the secret of that distant grave, fill the moldered eye- sockets, put reason in the brain and the ma- gic power of speech in the still tongue, that the dead might speak to her what she so longed to know! How grand to throw her arms proudly about Lucy's neck, in the soli- tude of her own thoughts, to dream of her- self as the child of some -noble mother!. Then would she uproot tihe flower of love- she could not rightfully retain, throw it up toward heaven with a smile, and plant in its stead a sprig of duty, which, though it be bitter enough, is poisonless and may be made to bloomn. Bowed at her winlow, she sent up this passionate appeal to the Heaven which looked coldly, of all the world, upon her. As forgotten strains of music reassert themselves in the memory and rouse the sleeping echoes in the heart, the glorious words of the infinite Saviour seemaed to blaze now over the vast parchlment of the sky, as written by his invisible finger in stars, and she looked up to read the words of promise: "With God, all things arc possible." "Whoso believeth on me, though he- die, yet shall he live again." "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls." a .  .  .  .  .  .   "The samebeautiful spirit, the struggling, sacrificing, faithful discharge of duty!"   As Lucy Pegram   saidl this, she took from her writing-case a folded sheet aind Iread, prc facing, "-It is the swan's note of the noble woman, and a girding up of loins to follow to the bitter end the Vanner of the great Captain, who died for Iove; it is the wail of death and the, chant of victory; it should be carved, M ark, (above her deathly sleep." OOETIIES WORDS. - 8   BMARIAN LAROUX. "Anh if I love thee, what is that to thee!" Canst thou not see That thou dost love is all in all to me? - In trance, I lay XVon a lake's, fair marge;  Tall lilies, large, Edged it daintily, as a knightly targe Purpled by maiden's hanldiwork. So sweet a place Can bear no trace Of aught but love, I said, and saw thy face,   lWhicl lit the dreanm, as sunset lihts a bay With one last ray Just ere the night comes, and fadledl asway. Dream of dear love! Has life no perfect lovc? Vainly above The spaceless lood, like the patriarch's d ovc, Shall my soul fly, and ever find no rest? At last, no nest Fold up the weary wings? no loving breast? Then sudden rose a wind. Along tlic ICIre' Were whirled the sere And crisped leaves, as faithless souls lby fear. Has Love its seasons too? I said-its clhain Of sun and rain? Will its spring, once frozen, ever come again? The dead lake stirred beneath its misty shroud. One crimson cloud Foretold the day. A voice rang clear and loud; "iMortal! dreamer! arise and workol ainain! God gives no pain, No wound he will wilth love not heal aalin!"   CHAPTER XXXI. MRABILIS JALAPA--IT IS ABOUT FOUR O' THE CLOCK IN THE LIFE-DAY OF MARIAN LAPOUX.   "IELLO here! where's every body? All whisked away by a raid of headless horse- men?  I suppose my dressing-gowrn and slippers are to go out of fashion because fires and winter have! I suppose I'm to have nothing for supper-not even the chickory Confederate money has entailed on patriots. It's terrible to have all the natural comfort- ers and sweeteners of one's life go away vo- luntarily, and leave one to the tender mer- cies of a new cook for those things that keep you fronm being dreamy of nights. Am I a heathen, to be treated in this manner?" There being no one in General Pegram's house but that august Vitellius himself, this conversation was a soliloquy, and very much less satisfactory than it would have been had some one else been there to answer its inter- rogatories,. with a kiss. There was much stentolrious breathing, while the speaker, having gained his own room, mloved elephan- tinely into every corner of it, attempting to metamorphose, sans the wonted assistance, his gray s5ack-coat into a striped dressing- robe, and his heavy brogans into a soft pair of velvet-work-ed slippers. If the articles over which he stumbled in the gathering gloom had been consigned to the classic place his maledictions referred to, they would have had a very hot, uncomfortable time of it. No sooner had he thus invoked the prince of sulphur than he discovered that " sonme- body-the archangoel of darkness himself, I suppose-has made away with the lucifer- matchlles." It is a singular fact, in this con- nection, that, if a fire break out in the neigh- borhood, or a strong presentiment of rob- hbers penetrates the nightcap of madam, or infant Hopeful, Esq., is seiz'ed, according to the wonted perverseness of his little devil- ship, with an exposition of crying at three in the morning, the matches are absolutely cer- tain to be out of reach. As it is Lucifer,   deadly enemy of light, who does the mis- chief, he straight completes his freak by dispatching the imp of anger to enter in the paternal breast, to coin a mint of maledic- tions in his heart, to catch the reverse end of his robe de buit on some projecting point, to make this post so heathenly impolite as not to get out of bI way, and raise the deuce generally. -.What with the little devil crying- and the huge one blaspheming, madam has a hard trial; and- all youthful housewives should be herewith advised to have none of lucifer- matches, and keep always ready waxen ta- pers. These are so short and slippery, his satanic majesty finds it impossible to ride astride of one. General Pegram was probably unaware of this phenomenon of nlatches, or he would have accepted the situation molre as a matter of course, however keenly he might have felt his disappointment of not being able to smoke. As yet, though, there was nothing inflammablle in the hollowed titer's head the ingenuity of the M--  clay-potter had fashioned as a pipe. H-ad there becnm the hot anger of Augustus mihllt have sufficed to light it. Few things are so contagious -as anger born of trifles. For fear that the reader may so far sympathize with Vitellius as to become somewhat infected, the author has- tens to compose the burly hero, and to en- sconce him on his porch- in a large arm-chair, whence he sends up such clouds of smoke as to entirely obscure the wonderment of little Jennie Pegram-the malignant tiger- scowl of the pipe-baker. It was nearly dark when his truant Wife and daughter, followed by Mrs. Hurt and Marian, dismounted from a- carriage at the gate and entered the house. The master was amiable again, under the sedative influ-   ence of tobacco, and welcomed the runaways, especially congratulating Marian on her abi- lity to ride and the flush imparted to her cheek. "Mariette came with her carriage," said Mrs. Pegram, "and we couldn't resist our desire to see at one time all the attractions of Mi--. Isn't Westville beautiful? The avenue from the college, why, it's perfectly lined with sweet gardens and villas!" "And near Alice's house, pa, you can see, oh! a dozen miles, I reckon, down the river; and away against the horizon there's a huge mound, built by the Indians, with a tall tree in the centre, floating toward one side like an ever-unfurled, motionless flag." "What a matter-of-fact people," exclaimed Marian, reclining on a couch, "not to have a legend connecting the growing flag with the happiness of their pretty city!" "That wouldn't do at all, Miss Romance; for then, any night, the prosperity of the city might be destroyed by some darkey coon- hunter with half a dozen blows of his hatch- et. No news of Lee yet, Mrs. H1urty" "No, sir. But here's a paperDr. Hurt sends you; it came fromn a friend of his in Florida, who obtained it of a party landed by the steamer Qwl near St. Mark's a few weeks ago. He has marked a paragraph of an arti- cle describing a Confederate ball in HHavana. The correspondent is a good rebel, and takes occasion to mention the names of several Confederates in Cuba." "That's very thoughtful." "Yes! as all personals have been stopped." "What can have become of Leopold?" "I expect he has started to amble through Europe, deeming it hopeless to try to get home." "The young man will revel -among Eng- lish sights and sceneiy." "He will go at once to Gcrmany, sir; our parents were born on the. Rhine. This cor- respondent speaks of a young Mr. Wilson whose adventure at sea he had described in a former letter.? J That mlust be the noble rascal!" said Ge- neral Pcgram as, having received the paper, he sat down to pore over it through his spec- tacles, oblivious, from that date, of the'talk continued around him.        B Marian reclined on a couch, her head fill-   ing the dimple its own weight sunk on the pillow. Lucy pulled a sweet blossom of tho four-o'clock (mirabilis jalapa) and placed it in her hand. Marian's eyes grew bright and her voice trembled; she smiled gratefully receiving the flower. "It is just beginning to reclose its golden petals, Lucy. It's a tiny .temple in which the fairy motes have worshiped their great Creator. Now the chants cease, the devotion is done; all the eve its songs and prayers have gone up in perfume; some in- sect-gnomeE clothed in a surplice of gossamcr- web, hath spoke to -his fellows of the divine tenderness the spring has shown them; an insect-hymn, soft as a Hyblan bee-song, hath echoed from its velvet-walls, and insect- hearts have thrilled with invocations to the - immeasurable God! But now the night is come, its doors arc shut in peace, and Hea- ven's blessing rests in summer-twilight on the flower-church. Night and death lay sootliing hands on troubled hearts. As a Christian loops up his dress to walk through the shadowy valley, the blossom folds itself to pass the night." Mrs. Pegram stooped to kiss the spealker's pale cheek, murmuring, "My sweet preach- er Marian," and went to prepare tea. The sweetest smile shed a kind light on her fca- tures while she bent Over Mariain. As she leaned about the supper-table, her eyes filled with tears. How touching is the sure, slow, visible de- cline of a young woman! How terrible that the fairest embodiment of leicaltli must bo consumed by pain! Ah! dreary pine, lone in this bitter sanld! whose life-giving roots arc gradually deadened by the overwashing slime of disease, whose heart is numbed with the cold that twraps its icy arms about thy green! Thou'rt still happy if throu dream'st of the palm that blooms by the waters of the eternal city, overshadowing the throne of the,merciful God. "Lucy," continued Marian, "it's curfew- time; let's hlave our vespers too." Lucy sat down to the harp, ald Mrs. Hurt placed herself by the side of MAarian. Tcn- derly rang the voices and the strings; softly rose the strain, floating through the leaves, and swelling and dying on the air as a rcst- less wave on the beach.   Suddenly, simultaneously the voices ceased, and Lucy's hands, dropping paralyzed along the still-sounding strings, sent forth a con- fusedl AEolian note, unearthly in its wildness. The sound of a flute, instantly changing from its accanpaniment of the song just begun to a wcll-rcrnemmbered air, reached the ears of the party at the porch. It fainted away, and three forms- emerged frolm the shrubbery round the gate. "Mark! Mark!" exclaimed Lucy and Mariette. Lieutenant Iilton threw his arms about them both. Marian's grateful tears, ever ready to do the bidding of joy or grief, sprang to her   eyes, while she clasped one hand of Mark, one of rough-coated O'Hara. Congratulations, tears, welcomes, kisses, laughter formed an olea podridc of boister- ous joy; and it was some time before. Dr. Hlurt could explain that he lad found two soldiers leaving his gate wlen he went home at dusk; had been asked Iby them the way to General Pegram's; had recognized Mark; and the little surprise was executed when, approaching they heard the harp and voices. When Mrs. Pegram led the happy crowd to the supper-room; Lee's absence was near- ly forgotten in the unaffected pleasure of this friendly reunion.   CHAPTER  XXXI. A PEOPLE S DREAM AND A LOVER S VIOLET CRtUSHElD.  TIIE AUTITOR 01BB13LES, ALMOST WITH- OUT HALTING, FtRO31 ANOTIHEI LOVE-SCENE.   TuB crowding great events Tlhich fill the last sad pages of this Nar's hstory are yet fresh in a11l miinds. With strange rapidity the disasters marshaled by destiny defile after ealch other, swelling the grand result. A heroic people, so long and bravely con- tendinhg in the uinequal fight, dealing fierce blows, triumplhing sometimes, beat down oftenest, blecding, sweltering, freezing, tor- turedl with wounds and hungler with many- headel want, deafeninr thleir ears and steel- ing their hearts against the cries of the famished to struggle on; in a lirne of nearly unceasing fatst appointing other fasts, that divine help nlight be implored to hold up a shield of defense. At length the time is come; the longr-strained nerves give way ; the gla- diator kneels in his ow-n blood, and the idea of secession dies covered ith. crimson hlo- nors, with honoring woundl. For the sake of then w-lhose firm hearts, lately swelling witlI patriotic pride, are stilled now, niolderingc beenath the plow ;'for the i sae of soul-wrounds yet smarting with loss of friends, brothers, betrotihed, husbands; for the love of humanity and the patriot's faitlh iii God, do not -say it was ali in vain! Do not even say it could have been avoidedl! The conquerors shouldl not so sully tiheir tri- umph. Let them bowr to Omnipotence in victorly w-ith some of the humiliation that bellds us in defeat. Let them supplicate for divine counsel that iwhat of wickIness is in their hearts, of foolishilness in their minds, may be remnoved; that no more may this great punishment be let fall on national crime; that a skillful and God-fearing Palinurus be set at the helm, and no more the temipest lash the quiet sea .into revolution. God have pity on theln who, having seen the horrors of the war just passed, still strive like riends to replace the bloodly vail   peace so quietly loops with golden cords of comfort, prosperity, and wealth! Should such men be Imade to go beneath the yoke, who, environedl on every sidlc-an arlmy in front, in rear, on either flank--with gaunt, -ottering flrames, with tattered clothles ancd flags, with shoeless feet, no lIoDe left but their grand old chief and the mbmlory of former fields des;pair clttchng at thehi vitalq, , cold nunlbitng thei limbs, yet prepared to fight anld wept to surrendler? 'T'hey aLre im- mortal in the tales each sire will tell of dee1ds that can not die, in the \world-r evelrence which makles Lcce's and Johnston's armies household words; in the world's honor which twines fame about thieir brows, and w ill erect i in the temple of history a nlonument to their grand vilrtues, blazoning to all time thleir for- titude, their modclration, and their valolr. With the terrible night of Franklin com- mences the dread tragedy; through the sutc- cessive scenes it proceedls of Savannahl, Co- lunbia, Nashville, Charleston, Wilmington, Mo)bile, Richmnondl, Apllpollattox. At l;lst the grand 7denouemewnt, and the young repub- lic yields up its trclllbling life withl the sword of CGecneral Lee. IMay the natioln of the con- queror eniulate his magnificent courtesy', and. the magnazniltity of Gencral Gurant be typical of the generosity of a mihtt peplle! "Merciful Heaven! is it possible?"  Our friends were standing, sitting, and walking on the steps among the flowers of Genleral Pegram's house. Thle mail had just arrived, and the oldgentleman's curiosity for news- more eager than that of the young people, who were botanizing a species of verbcna- had first found the paragraph which caused his exclamation. Hlis eyes cloudled, and he pointed nlutely to the column headed, "Great News fr0om Virginia!"Lucy read the first wolds:   "The aygue rumors which have lately reached us of disaster to the army of North- ern Virginia have at last culminated in the heart-rending intelligence of the surrender of General Lee and Mis entire command. We give in ano ther place the offcial correspon- dence" etc. etc. '. It wIill be seen, etc. etc. - Expressions of sudden grief went round the little assembly: "God help us!" "Those gallant fellows surrendered! I don't believe it." - "General Lee a prisoner!" "Arrah! but it's a bloody joke," ex- claimed O'tHara, crushing in his hand a flower he had pulled for Varian, "if it isn't thrue; and not a jittle av it I'd belave if Grant and Sherman put ther nasty honors to ther thrembling words, the thievin' spalpeens!" The corporal, driven into his brogue by his vehemence, was checked by a glimpse of the tearless' face and calm eyes of Marlian Laroux, and turned sharply on his heel, in pretense to brush off an imaginary caterpil- lar that should have fallen on his shoulder- in reality to sweep an arm roughly across his shaggy brow. "God help our poor country!" murmured Mrs. Pegram. "We will wait, Dugald," said Mark Wil- ton, " for one day to confirm these woful tid- ings. If it does, we'lljoin General Johnston." "O Mark!" exclaimed all the girls to- gether, their hearts beating fast with excite- ment and foreboding. "General Johnston! Begeorrat that's like my joinin' Cap'n O'Flaherty in ten days, when we sailed together from Thames, him on the Spitfire and bo'swen O'Hara on the Ella, bound for Cadiz. Faix! I touched AIel- bourne first, and Cap'n Andy didn't touch anywhere that I've heard of-"K "At the bourn from whence no sailor, etc. " suggested Mark. "Blessed Andy O'Flaherty! I wanted all me life- to be at his zcake," continued O'Hara with all the equivocality of an Irishism. "Poor fellow! he'll never inhabit Ely- sium, I suppose, being never wfaked with the rites of burial." "Alas! no, he can never even get over Styx." "The sticks through which Pat must be waked and buried you refer to-shillelahs?" "General Johnston is our only hope now,   and you'll find him zoakinzg up the enemy before- he follows O'Flaherty." Speaking, General Pegram pulled up AMark's sleeve and showed the still sore, discolored wound which had nearly deprived him of his right arm: "Girls, can we allow a-disabled soldier to return to duty?" Trhen followed a chorus of negatives and entreaties to Wilton not to think of resuming his command until, at least, he could wield. his sword. As the party separated, O'Hara, wlep had stood the bantering of his friends like a hero, contrived unnoticed to leave his crushed vio- let in the hand of Marian, and softly to hid her a special "good night." Mark Wilton and Miss Lucy continued after dark to walk atnong the Circular paths of the flower-garden. Flowrery seemed their life, because Love is a blindfolded- child unable to see the rocks and abrupt cliffs which lie hid to its peril, blind with the gla- mour of its own dream. Mark had to relate over what had happened to him since the skirmish in which he received his grievous wound, the unspeakably horror of the foul prison, his utter helplessness among these lepers, his chafing inability to assist his comrades in arms.  Woful humanity .! The suffering of Ivan- hoe, writhing in the burning castle of his enemy, while the mingled din of fire and bat- tle clangs in his fevered ear, was not greater thaf that so stoically endured on this fro- zen coast. No tender nursing was there to soothe with angrel-touch; even nmother earth, the dying prisoner's only refuge, presented a bleak and wintry bosom, a narrow tract of comfortless sand. Justice will acquit of Andersonville be- cause through dire necessity its miseries were only paralleled by the wintcr-trenches of Frcdericksburg and the Valley. Perhaps we should be grateful that Point Lookout was no worse, since now, when the Titanic passion of the combat'-is spent, a cultivated heart boils with the wish that a wliole people might be jailed in the valley of the shadow of eternal death, shut in with bayonets and with the immortal enemy of heaven dreaming his damnable treacheries, like black clouds above whatever torment awaits the folrever lost.         t   Wilton's stolry related, Lucy narrated hersX -all that led to -and followed the aban- donment of Casstlewood. Hand in hand they uwanderedl talkingr in tremulous tones and giving a hudllrc1ed difcercnt tokens of their mutual love. "Many a night, Lucy," whispered Wilton, "have I lain awake on the ground and gazed through the crecvices of our tattered tent at yonder star. In spite of the icy wind, its gleam was soft and tender.  It shone on brightly and calmly above the howl of the waves. Over the wild commotion of nature, the terrible anger of men; over want, and suffering, and blood; over. plenty and joy, its light was still unchanged. It was a sweet symbol to me. Is not our love a tender, un- changed, uncQhanging star?" Only the stars overheard Miss Pegram's reply to this sentiment, and have never yet been induced to divulge it, feeling flattered, no d0oubt, being mostly feminine, by hearing one of their number charged with constancy, and perforce displaying the virtue which they arc conscious of having least claim to. (Vide Helrschel and Ilumboldt for accounts of many star-flirtations writh the fast young men of space, the dissipated comets.) "But there's a mist," continued Wilton, whiich your confession, Lucy, should now tear away. Tell me why you rode several times at night to our encampment in Vir- ginia?" "I? I ride along to your camp at night? Mark, that is too earnest a jest."  "Lee saw your horse, saw the rose em- broidered on your saddle-cloth. Who did it? Was it a somnambula?" Her expression, as the eyes bent to the ground for an instant, then raised themselves to meet his steadily, convinced him of her innocence.   Now for the first the the whllole truth concerning Marian flashed into Lucy's in1d. For the sudden swoon at the p;^e of hcw cousin she had soughrllt a ssolltitl in Hc poor condition of Marian',s helllth-in the unex- pected, so vividly presented fate of one she had so mulch reason to detest.  Now Lucy understood clearlly. Marian's delicato naturc had been stung to despera- tion by the uncertainty clouding her birth; had braye-d perils a soldier might have shrunlk from; had dared what only rectitude would dare; had been affrigihted at no dlaner, grop- ing for that whllich might give her peace. The only wonder was, that life had not flown with hope. Lucy drew her companion to a bench and told in earnest words the heroisml of Malrian; her moody guardianship; her cousin's ty- ranny; O'Hara's rescue; her ballet-life; her fealr lest the 5secret might again depart writh her cousin, wrhich dlrovo her to hLis tent at midlnight in vain wish that something rnight be gained there, that intimidation or entreaty might wtin some result of good. And then the speaker's descriptioll of the twilighllt in the CIchurchyard-of wrhat mlust have been Alarian's feeling when her great fear wals re- alized, and the red ealrth slut lher forever froml the knowledge of what she yearned to lknow-was so toucling that Wilton scarcely kept back the tears which thlreatened to ovcrwash the bulwarlks of his Imanlincss. "Alark, her wrongs have been too great for endurance. The grievous cross presses her to the earth, anld she trmcllbles on the velrge of the unknown. Yet faith lightens somewhat the sore burden, and she looks to Him who alone leads us into the kingdom of perpetual peace."-   CHAPTER - XXXIII, CROSS AND EVANGEL.   DURING several' days after the evening described in the last chapter our friends were tortured withl suspense -as to the real fate of General Lee and the grand ariny. The air seethed nwith a thousand conflicting rumors of victory and defeat. In the mean time Shllrman was pressing on i Sheridan snwoopedl down firnom the north- west, and Bragg and Hoke were slowly driven upon Goldsboro. Suddenly came -an unes- pected dlanger andi a new attack. .hillc Spanish Fort stood proudly ldefiant, lbeating back its invaders in bloody defeat, a corIps-s of cavtalry, ovexrwshelmling the Confederate forces at Selma, swept almost without op- position thlrough Moontgt'omery, Avest-Ploillnt and Colhimbus. The wilidest, not unreason- able, c temetnit p)cevailedl at M--. To oppose tilis onruili of disciplined vetelrans was nothin  bu}lt the cradle and the grave. Inmates of hospitals, boys, old men too helpless to walk, decrepit With age and in- firnlit s ridlin" ill bDiries, went to the breast- works to' afl;rd their feeble help in defense. The gladiator no longer kneeled, butl lay prone, still strugglinrg; one last effort iritl his latest ibreath I As one lmakes way for that which is resist- less, those at --, -who could, retreated from the danger. Our friends resolved-to remain, confident that they could not out- speed a raid which had so quickly traversed one third of the country. Mark and O'Hara would not remain and be caught like holed foxes, mounted their horses, and rode forth toward the north. The llast conflict of the war, on this side the great river, was joined at this point. Here, on that commanding eminence which towrers so hig-h above the winding waters of the Chattahoochee, peering far into Geor- gia on one hand, into Alabama on the other, the bullets of an unknown Federal Indian   found the hearts of gallant Captain Gon- zales, and of the magnificently brave Gene- ral Tyler General Wilson pressed on to M acon, was stopped by flag of truce, and began the armnistice which, we devoutly pray, may never end. ThI'ere was peace-bitter, terrible peace. The last suns of April shone pleasantly on the smoking homesteads of the conquered and the glittering bayonets of the conquer- ors, to grieved and exultant hearts; on sol- dicrs reveling in camp, other soldiers tramp-  ingt wearily homre; on illuminated cities and" darlkened villages; on one section jubilant with vidtory, the other silent with defeat; on demoralization, triumph, woa, want, and death; pomp and misery, laughter and tears -a seethingr Mcdean boil-pot, from which God grant this country mnazy come purified and reborn. H"How is oMarian this morning?" "Very comforltable .tonw, mna'am. What with this genial May and your love I am almost well, qa m e're.' Mrs. Pegram's smile answering Mar*a s - wras sad, for she saw the contradiction of these hopeful words in the " wan paleness of the wasted cheek, in the glittering bright-. ness of the sunken eyes." " Do you not read too much, Marian?" "No, no, no! do not take my books from me! Don't tell Dr. Hurt about my books, dear, mother! Oh! I have little left to me but them; do not talske all I have got, except my life 1" With a fierceness and energy Mrs. Pegyram had never seen her show before, Marian. ex- claimed thus; but instantly regaining her composure resumed; "Forgive me, my dar. ling, I forgot myself. Did I not speak of the spring of your tenderness? But for your love, mother, I would have died long since.   How I can ever repay such affection as yours, one so nameless, helpless, so weak as I am?" Pardon so tenderly illplored" could not be refused by one whose thought was sad with the dim memory of an infant so long ago torn from her bosom and placed she knew not where, to undergo she knew not what temptations, to sink she kner not how low under their crushing weight. "It is an image of the pleasures of the world," continued Marian, rather in a tone of soliloquy than address. "Heaven, you know, Marian, is our re- ward for self-denial of the harmful of these." "Isn't this splendid, mother?" said the invalid, unheeding Mrs. Pegram's reply, and reading froom the, book whicrl lay open on her couch. Tormented with burning thirst, Cyma- doce gathered from a shrub a firuit resem- bling a golden citron ; but no sooner had she tasted it than she found it filled with a bitter and calcined dust. ' You see,' said Jerome, to his astonished companions, ' places rendered memorablle by the benedictions and curses of heaven; this river is the Jordan; yonder lake is the Dead Sea. It appears brilliant to the eye; but the guilty cities entombed in its bosom have poisoned its waters. Its depthls arc solitary, and desolate of any living creature. No vessel ever plowed its lwavecs; its shores are Mwithout birds, wmithout trees, without verdure. Its waters have a horrible bitterness, and are so heavy that the fielrcest winds can scarcely agitate them. The skies of this region seem inflamed with the fires that consumed Gollmorrah. Cymadocc, these   are not the banks of the Painisus and the valleys of the Taygetus. You lare now on the way to Hebron, on the spot which rc- sounded with thie voice of Joshulta wh llen 1ho arrested the course of the sunl. XYou aro treading a land yet reeking with the wratth of Jehovah, but whllich has since beenl clhelred by the words of the mercy of Jesus Cihrist. Youngc catechumcn! it is through this sacred solitude that you pass to seek Iiiim w-hom you love. Let the recollections of tlis vast and sorrowful desert be associated withl your love, to strengthen it and Irender it Inore grave. Tile riew of this scene of desolation is -alike fitted to nourish or extingutishi the passions. Innocent virgin! thlle arc legiti- mate! thou art not compelled, like Jerome, to stifle them under burdens of lburning sand!' As he spolke thus, they descended into the valley." Marian closed the volume, and continued miusingly( I The fulfilllment or life is to be one among the glorious malrtyrs; to regret the passiens of the earth whictl arIe bittlci poison-fruit; firomn the last nilutopso gli- Otis with God's suinlightt t    h mtli oN dtlcn Daclk in the burning sand, and dcscend Inrto the valley that opens up to lth Holy fl]and."

CHIAPTER XXXV. - TENDER UER1OIS3 I   DUGALD O'HARk' WS not a repulsive chta- racter, though it must have been very hard to love him. HlIis attachmrent for Tarl; VTWil- ton, altnost the only fondness he hiad ever felt for any body, had checked his rudenesses and somewhat tamed his w-ild nature. He wis "now totally chbnged, by an aect;on as strange as that of an oak for a violet. Wonderful are the transformations of love! It melts, metamorphoses, makes the rough heart kind, the cold heart warm, the flinty tender as its. own philanthropy; it is the flower aspllodel, at whose touch tremble the hoary sea-towters of impenetrable rock; its power is next to the omnipotence of God, who is love; it is the hceaven of eartlh. The paradise of heaven must lbe the etherealizcd perfeotion of this. Heaven help him who is not Prepared for the love of God-by some true love here!I Ten years ago, O'Hara, weary and dejected after a long search for employment, left the crowTded centre of New-Orleans and walked aimlessly toward the sublurbs. IIis bent head was suddlenly raised by the fierce bark of a dog and a frightened scream. Close by him a little girl passing along the walk was scared by an unchained dog, which reared up on the inside of a fence, snarling and crunch- ing 'the hem of her apron in his fanged teeth. O'Hara caught the chld in his arms, and 'struck his hob-nailed iheel against the dog's head writh such force he wans glad to creep howling to, his lair under the steps. Withl gentle talk the Trish sailor soothed the weeping Marian, and won from her the direc tion to her home. The same roof sheltlered them twelve months, while he did the por- terage for the house of Luroux & Co. Then, following the bent of his roving disposition, he went to burrow among the golden entrails of the West. Ruined in California, O'Hara flashes out again, like the fiic of cannon- smoke, at the dismal siege of Sebastolpol.   Peace to Europe is not peace to him; he goes to fight it out with the ocean. The sea is an untiring warrior; to those w-ho have ever cngaged the monster he allows short truce; again and again he thhrows dlown the gagec of war, and they, with a basilisk fasci- nytion, vlush from tho quiet of thiD Iand to rcnoew the restless conflict. In. timne and cadence with- the first drum that, fiery yet reluctant, beat to arms tile men of 1801, O'Hara marched thlrough Northern Virginia, was wounded at Arkanas- sas, and was earning a support during his convalescence by light work at the sttand of - his old employer, when his native wit re- vealed to him the situation of MaTrian; and his affection, united with jealousy of her cousin, assisted her out of his clutches. Associated with her now every day, not so blind that he could not see the progress of her fatal disease, the heaviest burden was laid on him. Now shone forth the bright- ness of his character. O'Hara the ditcher, porter, miner, sailor, soldier, who lad braved death in a thousand shapes, had borne un- daunted fronts to the gt'im perils of- battle and to the fiercest fuiry of the nngry main, the stoutest of stout soldiers, the most care- less of rollicking seamen, was now becomie a silent agonizer in this turmoiling life, for l1e was a hlero. To yield a love up to other lovint, arms is jealousy; to give it with the numbing clasp of deathl, w-ith all the yearning of the heart ulnexpressed, is heroism. It is better to see its happiness than its decay, to tliink of ita joy than its dust, to scatter stiiles on its bridal than flowers on its tomb! To love hopelessly is to live aimlessly; is to follow alva ys a vague vo ice from the dar kness, which ndver orows flute-like ; is to grope blindly lwhere a shadowy hand beckols ever into deeper night! O'Hara's eye lost its roguish twinkle, and   stared wfith a dim steadiness. His rough beard and horny hands, his swarthy face and brusque manner, gave little token of the hidden fire. With the lengthening May-days Marian slowly declined-. At last the spring was nearly gone to her, for now it was rarely possible to leave her bed and lie out on the couch that, centaur-shaped, seemed to stamp the cwestern porch with its iron hoof, while its eyes, shone on by the setting sun, beamed with the intelligence of Apollo. Usually this timne found her reclining with calm thought and smiling face, sadly cheer- ful in the pleasant light. This evening the sun went down in a gray mist, and Marian's heart sank, too, gloomily. She bowed her head on the maned neck of the centaur, and murmured, I Infinite Father! bring him, home to us again. Oh 1! can. I be content under the grass of yonder hill, if I shall see him no more? Come back to us, Leopold! Come back to us!"' When now O'Hara approached her, it was too dark to see traces of tears. WTith a clumsy greeting he presented a bunch of flowers. Miarian smoothed her voice to ex- press her kindness for the little gift. "Mr. Corporal, do you like - flowersV'? (Pacr parenthese, what foolish words may occur in a sensible conversation!) \ "Like flowers! sure I do. -My old mas- ter at Darryvarah taught me they wGre the lavins of St. Pater's dinners, and the dews on their purty cheeks the dhraps he shook from his hands. He said the purtiest rose we hev down here was jist no more'n, no more'n the manest cabbage in his kitchen- garden. That was a beautiful idea to us, half-starved childer, Miss larian. Wte never had any lavzins at dinner, and here were St. Pater's potato-scuds springing ap all blue and grean, and fresh as, violets and dande- lions.". "Famished Ireland! - better its flowers had been vegetables." "Ah! no. Better than that, Bliss, to die and let the rose drop her leaves, like tears, upon ye! Ireland's famishin' for freedom now, and its murk, murk night upon Per. Av she didn't have her mornin' glories, may be she'd forgit her Emmet, and him of Dary- vane, and Mitchel."   "They'll famish here now for bread and freedom both; won't they, Corporal? for, alas I we've forlgot our morning-glories that the war's heel'crushed four years ago, in the dawn of battle and triunlph. Oh! I think the red roses are growing purple-black, like blood, and the white ones blanch with fear." "Yes; see their tents yonder! Hear the noises of their calllp. Wlo ever thought. United States cavalry would have trampled with bloody hoofs upon the bosom of Geor- gia, and blown harsh trumpet-calls in her frighted ear? Dugald O'Hara must take him again to the sea. Cold England can. not grind that in the dust, and Meaghler 'II find Irishmen enough here to prove that when he crossed it. he leaped the bounds bettzcanee liberty and a tyrant." "And yet, Mr. Dugald, the flowers bloom as ever they did, and the fear-pale white ones send up sweeter petitions to the sky, which is bright with stars for all this angry show of swords, and heavenly fresh falls the dew to-night." It's because these horses' hoofs are still new upon the ground, and the tigers have not yet lapped the blood they've shed ere they hunger for the slain. Oh! ye have not- felt unpitied grief, and scorn,- and unwon shame; ye have not, as swate Ireland, lain for years in prison, shackled to the dead forms of liberty; ye have not had to worship God and hate men; ye have not seen the little ones faint with want, their cheeks grown so hollow the tears rest upon. 'em in pools; and ye have not seen your mothers cast from green-thatched cots in the ould country to reeking cellars and foul misery here! If these things come upon ye with time, yer fields will bQ bare of - food and flowers, and sorrows will spring as thick as fens." "Food or sorrows, ny- friend, should- point gratitude or prayers to God. Flowers are sweet-sounding church bells ringing calls to adoration, and weeds must make us look with faith to Jesus'. thorns. Translated so, all the beauties and miseries of earth become as plain as guide-posts pointing the way to heaven." Sorely O'Hara was tempted to throw himself at Marian's feet, won by the enthu- siasm of the priestess, not by the mystery of the God, and to pour out his love in lava-   words expressing that she alone could be his guide to heaven, that only her gentle hand could prune off those deformities without which the branch might be no longer meet for burning, but fruitful of much good. His heroism triumphed, and he checked what he felt would be a scoriae river withering 'and scorching the young life it embraced. If he could help it, he resolved that she should never suspect how his old, knotted, worldl- hardened heart yearned for her kindness. It might kill her, he thought, and, faith! Death's impatient enough.   He set down in silence at her side, and Marian, inspired by his attention, eloquent with a fresh recollection of the spiritual ordeal through which she had passed, spoke to him of those rich blessings which, lilke the flowers from the thorn-wounded heel of Hyacinth, fell on humanity with the blood- drops of the Cross; of that wonderful faith which cleanses from all imnpurity, is a recom- pense for every loss, which changes the water of grief into the wine of joy; of that wonderful love which agonized and died for its beloved.   CHAPTER XXXVI. THE STORY OF CAPTAIN LAROUX.   AlICE LANDON came every day to the bedside of Marian. For long hours at night she sat by the sick-couch, bathed in cold water the burning hands, and smoothed the damp hair from the pain-wrinkled forehead. IMalrian seemed happiest under this gentle hantl; there was no room for jealousy in the fading mind and faintly pulsing heart. Alice read to her what she most enjoyed, some of the beautiful thoughts which flow from the earnest, boundless pen of Ruskin, and in the poetry of Keble. And once she knelt by her and assisted the helpless woman to cross her hands in the passionate clasp of Supplication. Hlow softly must Heaven have looked upon the tears which now burst from the two maidens; tears, in every one of which, as a soul within a body, was imnpri- soned an unutterable prayer for the common beloved; tears which in being wept expired, releasing thus the spirit-prayers to fly utp- ward, while themselves were buried ilS the bosoms and near the hearts that gave them rbirth. One day Dr. Hurt sent up a telegram just Teceived: "MAY 18, 1865. Look for me tomorrow. "EOPOLD WfILTON." To prevent any shock-which, of what- ,ever nature, if too sudden, might be fatal to Marian's weak condition Alice communi- cated this intelligence in ,uzrded expressions. It is impossible to describe the joy thus lighted on the pale features and in the blue eyes. Alice trembled for the result -of so much exultation, although it was shown in -no outhurst, but only in the most fervent, over'and over repeated thanksgiving. In the cvcning, when Alice came to -iss her, Marian threvr her arms about tier neck   with such1 a wild joy'that she trembled as if she had heard the laughing shriek of lunacy. Marian was very restless during the day, sleeping fitfully, and nmurmuring all the time the weird dreams which flitted, the more numerously with the lengthening shadows, through her mind. Night hushes the petulant world to sleep with low-sung lullabices of chorusing stars. Death comes like night, with gradutal darken- ing, with sphered music nnd bat-lilke dlreams.  Alice leap-d to catch every -ihisper; Bshe only heard incoherent words ending in hard, gasping breaths. Near morlnincg thne untiring nurse twas per- suaded to retire and -take some repose. She returned soon after dawn. Marian was somewhat refrcshed.  Hcr pil- lows were shaken up; she herself was placed in a new position ; herlon- hair was combed out, and she lay without pain, listening to some selections of Holy Writ which Alico read with moist eve and tremnDlingr voice. The rwestern train was duc at four in the aflernoon. As it rumbled in the long depot, amid thei clang of machinecry, the ringing of bells, and the din of voices, Leopold Wil- ton penciled the last entlry in his nlotebook: "May 19th. Thank God!" Whlat glorious cause there was for grati- tude! "Through four years of peril, want, and blood, over thouslands of mliles, through spiritual storms which had wrecked the fair- est bark-at last harbor; safe in haven, with tattered canvas, with many a dint, with broken niast perhaps, but with perfect helm and steadily-pointin,  compass, with expe- rience that is worth a thousand charts. After telegraphing, he had changed his 5 route for one more expeditious by a fe w hours. He was not, tlerefore, mnet at the   cars, but walked up alone in the well-known city. There Bwas no one at his own house. Making inquiries, he proceeded to General Pegrarn's. The streets were nearly deserted by all but soldiers in blue uniform, who stood about in groups or galloped with clanking sabres. He reached the house and went down the walk, bordered wtith acacia and roses. The door was thrown quickly open, and with a joyful cry his sister sprang to his arms. Yesterday's to-molrrow had, as it wMere, waited all the morning behind the eastern hills, albeit the sun went on his appointed way, and only dawned at five in the afternoon to these loving hearts. lrs. Pegram soon ended the multitudinous scene ,of greeting by taking Lee's hand and lead- ing him with mluffled feet from- this happi- n^Qt^Ti e sick-room. At sight of his- face /Marian half raised herself'in bed in the in- tense eagernesIof her joy; then her poor strength faile 'er, and, with a low moan, she fell back almost lifeless. Lee caugrht one hand in his earnest clasp, and ,her other rest- ed as-in benediction on his head, MKrian's face lost its expression of pain; it was radi- ant as she whispered, "At last! at last! I can now sleep in peace. O God! I thank thee." Utterly debilitated, she sanlk into quiet slumber. Lee thought him of the packet he had car- ried in the belt about his waist. He escaped from every body, and, gaining a hidden cor- ner of the yard, drew the package from its buskin cover. There was a confinement of silk tied and sealed With wax. He could make out several lettelrs-L a r and x-faintly stamped on the seal. It was not hesitation which preventedl him from reading for some minutes ; perhaps the bushes through which he passedl had showered on hiln the pearls-- dewy gifts-which the queenly night lov- ingly crowns them with. After a short in- terval, fiery curiosity dried the moisture on his eye-A, and he was able to decipher the message lheld out to him in the wriling. With a large blur of ink, as if the writer ended further vacillation by somne sudden-re- solve, yet in business hand, the letter b6gan: NEW-ORLEANS, 1859. IARUAN: This is addressed to you, but I triist you will never see it luntil you place   the hand of a wife in that of Rupert Laroux. To him I have bequeathed my property in goods and you; the owis acllquireld by hlo- nest trade, the other is mine by the sacred right of affection. Was it just that I should lavisi on her that infinity of love and receive nothing in return? You are the recompense fate has given me for my soul. You are the only memento of that time which was so terrible to my youth, which is the blight of my age. Through you I worship the image of her, the good; through you I pour my hlte on her, the traitress. But for ller, I could slay you; but for her, I would lavish on you sutch blessings as never lined the pathway of a child. That you should niever know her, that she should never recover you; this is the goal to which I have striven-tahis is what it gives me so inuch delight t tOlilg I have accomplished.  Why do I make your marriag   to your cousin- a condition precedent t thisl dis- closure? Because on his soul he is sworn never to reveal any thing that shall tendll, even the most remotely, to discover you to each other. With an oath, as sacred as if it were drulnk or written in blood, he is pledged to suppress every name or incident that mniglit be a clue to your union; and I have reserved to myself the privilege and time of showing you the perfection of my triumph l. He loves you, Marian ; for your sake, and for the hope of you, he has abandoned Mis mother, his family, his name. He has resolved to marry you.  Surely circumstance is impotent to resist such strong resolution, such strong affection, such strong probability as now unite in him to complete my cherished do-  sign, and sweeten so the few last drops of the bitter cup life has held to my lips. I think I shall sleep almost quietly if I dream of you wedded to my brave boy; whllile she-ha! ha!-she will think of you as a paramour, a mistress, a graceless grace of some gaudy--  Good God! w hat do I write t Forgive .. . ['rhis part of the manuscript was nearly illegible-blurred, crossed over, and rewlrit- ten, as if the writer, becoming convulsed with many passions, dropped his pen, or used it only after repeated paralyses of ermo- tion. With intense interest Lee read on:]   Forgive me, Marian! Of the ihumblest parents, I was born on th-e coast of B- rittanlly. Often I watchled my father straining his gaze across the storm- moved -waves. Sometimies his fierlce eyes wer1e stony ; sometimes tschey gleamed with a strange fire,. as if sonmething they saw lit up an eager desire in his soul. Onice I awsled him , with singular boldness, wat he lookeed for.  I Bread, boy, breadl!" he anslwered snappishy.?llrhaps this was the reason why what I ate --as so bitter; his fierceness and the ocean's salt poIsoned all ily food anld. poured brirty currentshs through mny veins.'

We had rum , and ch-ese, and mackerel, and once a lirge case of preserves floated up On the bch.  All day I rambled along the rocky coast and sought piecs of w-reck. 'I knew- nothing of God and couldn't pray; but oh! how fervently, at sight of a sail, have I wished thalt a tempest wouldl come and hiurl its shattered fragments to the mercy of us and my playmiates-the rolks! I ask no forgiveness for this; I was too young to know its crime, and at fifteen yealrs of age I was more ignorant than a child of eight. One molrning, after a terrible storm, nlmy father descried a wreck lying far out on the outermost reef. He started to her in his small boat and sent me down the beach. Wandering unsuccessfully all day, toward night I returned to our desolate hut. My father was not there. Three days of the most intense torture I waited there, or rushed like a madman alongrr the water's edge. I leaped among the breakers, and, lying pas- sive, let them roll me like a water-cask upon the sharp rockls. I stamped my feet on the pointed shells-tore out my hair and flung it like sea-weed in the heedless water. I had never been alone so long before, and it was simply loneliness, not the loss of him, thaTfmaddened me. I did not think of the possibility of his being drowned. When I threw myself in the waves, they flung me, worthless gift, angrily back on the sand. I thought he had deserted me. I bundled a few clothes -an old seaman's outfit-wifj   some plrovisions, and left our imiSCrable dwelling, not caring whther I went, only determined to revenge myself on hml for leaving me so long, and gloating over-the thoulght of how he would curse and rave when he returned to find me gone. Unhap- py tin! The only raving to which he was a party, I feel certain now, must have been the hollow ripple of the sea spurting through his empty eye-sockets; the only grief around our lonesome haunt, the moan of the waves as they writhed away from his lifeless form. Many a mile I trudged wearily toward the setting sun. At nightfall I came to life, to ldwrellings-a harbor, and tall shipping an- chored in it. Several nights I slept on the bare ground, several days I begged nmy food; until finally, by the instrumentality of an old woman, I nwas shipped on her husband's schooner as galley-boy. It needs not to. speak of this part of my life-of the hardships, the injustice, the misery I endured. H1undreds have gone through the same ordeal; the very men who have suffered it inflict it on their successors in the blind delusion that it is a part of the duty of the one and of the education of the other. In ten years I had made several voyages, was enmployed on many different vessels, and was now a master, when, being nearly thirty years of age, I got in the tobacco trade and came to Norfolk. I was completely sick of sailors, sold my interest in the bark Henrietta, and ram- bled over the peninsula seeking an invest- ment, filled with the idea of becoming a, planter. Marian, I was an adventurer. It was now that I fancied all. my tossings would end- that my wanderings, (God alone knows how weary they were,) weary, loveless, wander- ings, might cease-for now I met Janie Wilson.  You do not know-because you slept as only innocence can sleep-how many nights I have sat through the hours of darkness by your low couch and traced her features, line by line, in yours; pressing lovingly your soft hand sometimes; sometimes raving with the impotent madness of a caged lion, wildly jrfing in my rage, while you breathed so 5S3tly; staring at your closed lids and girl-   ish mouth until, her blue eyes opening on me from yours and her mouth having kissed me, all faded in a grim, stifling mist, Do yout wonder at and doubt the charac- ter of tlihat love which disappointment could so strangely develop? In the old time there were said to be trees which  no sooner reached a certain height than they withered,. shrank and grew up again with renewed vig;or and life, A thousand times has lay love reached its acme, changed from the young, healthful branch to dead, poisonous decay, and once molre resumed its growth. My reading, the only education I received, has acquainted me with some of the wonders of chemistry--by what slight addition tlings may be made to change totally and reversely their properties, tones, colors, and effects. Infinitely nature repeats these metamor- phioses-its glorious mnetempsychosis. I am a child of nature; for years I saw nothing to attract me but what mother nature offered. The very wrecks, and every thing, however artificial, that was tossed ashore, seemed to come in the same way, because it was the seals ancer, and no instrumentality of man, that gave them to us. Look abroad over the open wlorld of the natural, and. no longer wonder at the felrvor, the intensity, the burn- ing desire of nmy love for Janie Wilson. Did she love me? or was it my own passion Nwhich blinded me in my estimate of what she be- stowed?  This is a question I have asked over and over again-afsked it of myself- until it-seems to be darted into my brain from  a myriad forked tongues of a myriad imps. . Oh! she did love me. Believing it, how oftell have I passionately kissed you! Doubting, how  frequently I have almost failed to withhold my arm from dashing out  your young life, because its shrine so much resembled hers. I do not know, Marian, whether you hate  me. I have hoped that what-kindness I had shown might win your love; that 'my rough-  ness might seem to your age only a mystery of your youth; that, I having lived until you  were old, you would, never see this history,  and, my plans put in such favorable train by I your marriage-with Rupert, I might partially f forget mny wrong and die mourned by your 1 heartfelt grief. If by any chance you should i discover ...  But no-it is impossible.    You absolutely know nothing; you do not dream, even in your wildest speculation, whlat and whose yoYu aI e.

But for your featurces and your blood, You could not certainly pronounce that your na- tive land was not Kamtschatka or Atozam- bique. And to-day-ha! ha! ha! I'll buy a fan completely covered with Chinese hicro- glyphics, and tell you g;ruffly that you and , many a yTear ago, brolughlt it firom great Cathay.

I mnet Aliss Wilson firequently at social gatherings, in visits of business or pleasure at the house of her father; for the open-hearted hospitality of, Virginia admits no restraint.    Over all that country the eye could grasp from the highest spire of the town, she was acknowledged leader and belle. By as much as that spire towered above the dwellings around it, she surpassed all other maidens in beauty and grace. She was pleased with the garnished history I told of my adventu- rous life; her cheek blanched at my descrip- tion of a storm; she was transported with delight when I spoke of beautiful climes where all the air is an odorous breath of perpetual spring, where continual smiles left no room for frowns on nature's fair face. She trembled when I pictured myself a strip- ling of ten years tossed in our cocklle-shell boat anlong the hissing reefs of my native coast. I believe she wept when I whispered of cruel strokes with which hard men lashed me. Hecr gentle sympathy in all these things I took for evidence of dawning love, of an Interest too deep not to be tender. I had a large clain, two thirds of my not insignificant fortune, pending in England. It was connected with my former life on the sea. liy presence was required on the other side of the water. Pressing letters came, urging me to save whlat I had so long toiled for. Still I postponed, for I 'was loth to leave beautiful Janie Wilson. Then I re- flected on the folly of incurring- this loss for dread of tiree months' absence from this sweet girl. Was it not a presentiment that perpetually affirighted me? I reeled and nearly fell from the gangway as I traversed it from the shore to the vessel I who a hundred times, reefing the jib, had run along the bowsprit-guy as though Neptune's invi- sible hand staid me in unison with his dizzy heavings, as if moved with the mecha- nical precision of a puppet. My feet must- have walked too long ashore. Under the love-dripping moon of a sum- mer-night I met Janie Wilson, and our'troth was plighted in passionate words, made dou- bly, sacredly passionate with a kiss. Oh! I have felt that if I should live through an infinite number of year-cycles, though,count- less shapes enshrined my soul, no Lethe of change could ever efface the memory of that kiss. There is a beautiful yet terrible fancy inl physics that, in the infinite realms of space, not one word we utter is lost, but lives forever, vibrating in ether, or floating   like phantom.-ships upon a limitless sea; that, force being indestructible every breath i3 stamped by an omnipotent hand; that all our vows and pure words are luminously sprinkled there like stars, and all unholy-ut- terances blaze forever along this vault like comets in the firmament of heaven. W  'ho knows how much of his physical or cerebral system goes to make up the boomillng thun- der, or- how much enters in the electric torches-' invisible spirits of the sunmmer-air -flRare frornm peak to peak' of cloud-land? Our vows are reegistered on this mighlty tablet; they are written in on nly heart. How can I forget the caress that has been my Eden of hope, the pcrjury that has been a torturitig despair? MaLrian, I amn not mad. The clrazedl lbrlain docs not alnalyze, and I write w\ith' the calmnness of a, copyist. I have hacl enout111l t1 mad , md en outghtl to gnarl the strongest aitn(d, and armn the flamling gc- nius of Unreason witih his murderous sword. But I alm not lllad. I sailed for Liver-pool in the brigr Fortune near the close of the suminer of 18412. We had a terrible voyage. The Atlaltic rough- ened its trcachlerous bosom to keep lus back; head-winds blew us far from the course; two months passed ere we saw lantl again. When I touched it, the first informlation I received was that my interest had been lost, defeated by some unexpecteld application of maritime law. I was dcsperatc, laLvifng re- solved to purchase from these means, the3 contingency of losing which hnd not seiiously occurred to me, a queenly tlroussc(u to be laid at the feet of Janie. Now, distappoint- ed, downcast, poor, I would liave to retuLrn and . . . Ah! I was mad then. I know not ;)flf PrPC je     almo Llust krnow into what excess I, plunged-I a1most know nothing of this interval. Mfemnory catch es lip the torn -thread, and I was again on the ocpan. W hat could exceed my hortror when I was toldl that I had been shippetd as a common seaman for a voyage of three yealrs, bound to Aullstlralia! I implored the master to change Kis direction. I oftel-ed hinm half my lands in VTirginia. I threatened him-with death; for I learned that lhe was suspected of having intoxicated, robbed, and shipped nme. It was of no avail. But ere thee time of our voyage was half expired, I knew his guilt, and let fall my crushincg vengealnce on fjI I HLvrLIJVYII- --Z----  -   him. Every one of these letters should be as crimson as blood; nothing but chemistry could make an ink black enough to counter-  act the- redness of the hand that traces this writing. It is the hand of a murderer. The autumn of 1844 had begun, when I landed at Jamestown Island and walked up to the town of Williamsburg. I approached the old homestead. I Inquired for Mr. Wtil- son; a strange servant told mne he had been dead several months, and she believed the family now lived across the river. I asked for Miss Wilson. "Oh! Miss Janie, you mean? she is Mrs. Pegram now." I wheeled, and flemr, rather than walked, back to the river. Unaided, save by my own desperation, I pushed into the water a large boat lying bottom upmost on the beach; I paddled across in it and found Castlewood. Several hours I lay behind a hedge, watching its door like a beast for prey. Should I go in and taunt Janie with her treachery? I feared I might kill her. Should I wait and lay my deadly hands upon the person of her husband?  With no plan, still I waited, foaming, writhing, a serpent filled with the most venomnous thoughts of a snake. At sundown a nurse came out from the house, bringing you, Marian, a tender infant. She walked close to where I hly. I sprang up and caught her arm, stifling her screams with a merciless grip. Choking her, myself choked with fury, I asked your name, your mother's maiden name. I caught you in my arms, felled her to the ground, and rushed with you through the thickets. -Need I say that I escaped? The hounds missed me. The drapery of this terrible grief settled upon Castlewood, and we-I and my darling child, my treasure, my per- petual good, my only comfort-were lost in one of the dirtiest streets of New-Orleans. - Filth concealed us, and my matted hair, unshaven face, and ragged clothing were the fitting exterior for my-disordered mind. Oh! how miserable can be the journey through this desert-world! The wretched man, his trust once gone, urged by an invisible goad, llred by an irre- sistible desire for vengeance, passes by un- heeding the cool dews faith trickles through the sand for his refreshment, and plunges   on to the glittering mirage, while the beams of his flaming passion scorch his dizzy brain and reel his fainting firamc  Thank God I he can accustom himseclf to these depths of misery somewhat; that he can learn to fon- dle and sport with the poisonous spiders, the hideous comrades of his glooml, and almnost revel among these black-vailcU, filthy masks of joy! Living now almnost as a scavengrer, I grew calm and nearly cheerful cwhenl thae first rags was spent. For a short time I had you, child, and I used to call you IMarian Laroux; and I chose a tomb ill the large cemetery, which, I said to myself and you, covered Janie; and then she secled to b in hleaven smiling on us; and your chld's laurghl nwas heavenly music to me, while your small, white hands played fondly in my ugly hair. Brief semblance of content! I could not endure the thought of your growing up to want and ignorance. I had to exert myself. I left you with an Irish woman wholm. I knew to be honest, and devoted myself again to the sea. In the year 1847 I appear as a gentleman among the saloons of -lavana. Here I met a gentle nobleman, Rafael Do Aguilar, whose gentleness awas, the rich mine of my subsequent prosperity. I have no remorse on his account; I only put an ab- rupt termination to his descent; I merely precipitated what was inevitable; in a word, his wealth became mine because hle was weak enough to stake it all virtually on a tide that he saw plainly was setting in against him. Everything hehadwas in honor ninec. His cowardly spirit was too wealk to bear up against his reverse, and he died. I had his writings, sufficiently legal and explicit to change me from poverty to wealtlh without consulting his family, which thereby de- scended from wealth to want. But a newlv idea occurred to me. Taking a fancy to his eldest child anld only son, I united in ima- gination you and Rupert De Aguilar. In a moment of wneakness-for that was unneces- sary-I married hisimotherand returned to New-Orleans.    X   i You know howr successful I leave been in business. How could it be othlerwise, witl the doubloons of Do Aguilarl in my counting- room-with you, my diamond, at homc? Senora De Aguilar More for somec time my   fierce temper and changeful moods. Then she chose to return to Havana. Fate dropped another pledge of favor. She was gone, to taunt me no more with my fatal success, and Rupert was mine. She lives in Havana now, poorly but comfortably, and receiving aid from me when she asks for it. At last, at last-in spite of all the obsta- cles thrust before me-I am a wealthy, pros- perous man-almost a happy man; for have I not you and Rupert? Marian, this history has its end. M y sec- ond triumph consists in writing it; it is the ovation of triumph to the conqueror after victory. I now stamp it with my name. Its waxen bolts will not be thrown back until, the   priest pronouncing you man and wife, my face, marbled though\ it be with the cold of the tomb, will melt in a smile of triumph at this accomplishment of the last of my plans. I write it now because my physician says my death will be sudden, he thinks, too, that it will not be long defeirred. Perhaps I shall disappoint him; perhaps you will never see what it has given me so much bitter comfort to read over and over, until, with you and Hidalgo Rupert standing round my bed, I whisper you your name from dying lips-with trembling, death-shuddering lips, murmur to you that your name teas Janie Pegram. I trust the deaith-rattle will not prevent me from addinr that it is Scfiola De Aguilar!!!    -       .  ' *          '     *     -    CHAPTER XXXVIT.

TomMAsso GROSSr. "YE were wont to bring her flowers on birthday festivals; celebrate now only with flowers her great birthday, for the biDr is the cradle of heaven."-JEAN PAUL.   ONCE or twice, crumpling the pages in his clenched fist, Leopold Wilton repeated the words of the confession: "Janie Pegram! and she shall never know what and whose she is, until she places the hand of a wife in that of Rupert Laroux \ Nay, madman, but she shall know it, now that his fingers clasp naught but cold clay, and his eyes will never witness her marriage-morn I Else I know not why I have been brought here safely. Ah! it was to be the bearer of this late message, to give a smile to her care- worn face, which-angelic hope with sweet Lenore-shall float her spirit up to heaven, to put a happy round to years of sighs." I will be blind and full of doubt no longer, he thought. The sudden punishment of Rupert; the unforeseen thwartlillng of ,!1I those plans woven by Marian's guardian in his subtle mania; the contagion of sin and misfortune the miserable man seemed to scatter on all around him; the triumph of Marian-all these things crowded in his memory as so many stays to his infant faith iat the uspeakable mysteries, and po- tency, and goocess of God. He placed the manuscript in his pocket and returned to the house. On tiptoe twilight was creeping along the earth, and the faint occasional chirp of in- -sects sounded like the low "hist!" of one who steals behind a sleeping maiden to en- -ring her, ere she wake, with a scarf of flowers. Solemn, sacred, seldom laughing, night held on high a glittering garland of stars. "It is for her,' murmured Lee,; " for   now are the death-bands of Marian Laroux changed to the saintly robes of beautiful Janie Pegram!" At the door of the sick-roomll he mnet Mrs. Pegram. "How is -she now I'\ "Sleeping quietly, she is so weak." "Come with me to the parlor, ma'am, a moment!" They drew near the window and sat down in its faint glimmer. "Let me have the gas lighted!" "No, no!" eagerly answered Lee, "it is too garish, and this gloom becomes better both our hearts. and what I have to say. Will she live through the night?" Mrs. Pegran's heart opened its wound afresh, as she answered, "Oh! I hope so, Leopoldl."  "We have something that must be ,told her before she goes, Mrs. Pegram." "Poor darling! so gentle and so patient I Poor child!" Whose child, Mrs. Pegram?" "Whose child? do you know, sir? Tell me, do you know, sir?"With such startled expressions hMrs. Pegraim caught his arm, and bent to him with an excited energy very unlike her slow grace and soft manner. "You lost your first child, Mrs. Pegram. Where was she buried?-little Janie." E The speaker received no reply from his companion. Turning to know why, he saw a reeling form, and. was just near enough to somewhat break the fall of the fainting woman as Mrs. Pegram fell from her chair.   From the pitcher on the table he dashed a handful of water in her face, and, chafing roughly her brow and hands, lifted her to the sofa. She opened her eyes at first with a meaningless stare, remembered in a moment, and said, rapidly: "Janie! My precious, darling child, Janie! I am well now, Leo- pold. Let me go toher; let me see her once more; quick, it may be too late!" "Not now, please.  Compose yourself, and read this! Don't come to her to-night. If there occurs any change, I will call you. Good nights ma'am l" He handed her the rumpled manuscripts, and left her to read the fierce result of her own careless perjury. Every half-hour during the night Wilton was at Marion's side. She slept continually, though there was scarcely enough breath to signal the possession of life. Once she was awake, and pressed his hand so softly, yet is hard as her dying strength allowed. In the morning, Mrs. Pegram could be no longer restrained. Trembling, weeping convulsively, yet promising to be calm, she was admitted. She rushed to Marian's bed, crying, "My child! my noble, lost Janie!" Marian repeatd, with a bewildered look, Child I Janie!" then, as a sudden light shone in upon her mind, murmured, "fMy mother!"And Mrs. Pegram clasped an un- conscious form. All imagined it was depth, and a wail of grief burst from their stricken   'hearts. It was hushed by the authoritative voice of General Pegram: "She is not dead, my friends! Lucy, be calm, my child!  T'hrow open those blinds, Mark, if you please P" Contrary to all expectation, Marian lin- gered slumbering through the day. Near its close she Ewoke. For a few moments she would kno every thing that passed, and smiled to each,.s, knowing that the end was not far now, they strove without pressing to gain a final notice. O'Hara sat with his face shaded by his hand, and so still that hle seemed to be the death there. Tlhose around him did not know what volcanic pain writhed under his canlm exterior. Marian opened wide her A-d te eyes, pressed the hand of Alice convulsively, and whis- pered something,6 buttoo faintly to be heard. The eyes closed, and the cold was felt to send its blighting thrill al ng the limbs to the heart.       Ad The pale sunlight of the spring day trem- bled like a falling rose-leaf, and vanished from the west. To all but one ,in that room there was night; on her flitting wings shone the glory of the New Day, radliating from the great white Throne. Happy spirit! For, winging a flight across the sea of death, thou dost float far up above its mist and stormn tending straight toward the music of psaltery aDdl cymbal that sounds unceasingly i from all the star-shores of heaven!"   CONCLUSION. VALE JOLLY IRISHMAN, HAPPY, POOR IRISHMAN l   MARIAN LAROUX was buried in one of the most beautiful places of the nei., boring cemetery.  It is at the grave, perhaps, that the most terrible grief afflicts the mourner. Until then we have seen the sleeping form; we can kneel byUits couch, and expend slowly She subtle force of sorrow in tears and prayer; we can whisper vows into the cars that do not seemn altogether deaf, imprint passionate kisses on the snowy brow, and almpst fancy that their warmth melts somc- what the numbing manacle of Jailer Death. 'But now the earth opens its bosom and sueks down the victim. 'Death is to the body what the maelstrom is to the ship. The grave is the central point of the surface where the voyages of the human vessel converge to the last one; she no longer sails to east6or west, no longer heads which way she will. Even the giddy gyration of the last agony is over, and its only course is down. Above the human grave the winds billow the long grass as the waters of the sea are shaken into waves. Of the sunken ships the only com- memoration is the insatiate vortex itself. On the earth, loving hands heap a rude form-likeness of clay, or sculpture a shaft above the place. About the tumulus and the whirlpool, nature makes music in differ- ing strains of her many-toned song, the roll of waves or the flute-notes of piping birds. A   delicate monument marked the hal- lowed dust of this dear child, and with its chaste design-two angels bearing up a mai-  den, whose feet were soiled with earth, but I whose faoewas radiant with heaven-says  N to the passer, "Siste JLook upward and re- a joice' t)8 ir    * O'Hara and the Wiltons are at home.

Where? tVe know the home of the Wiltons; it is an earthly dwelling, soon to be gladdened, with smiles, and blazing of ntplial torches, and sc;atteringr of hymeneal flowers; it is a pleasant, sunny home in the reviving South. We know the home of Marian Laroux, an unearthly home, where percnnlial dews drop on n  erdying bloolms; where cherubini d serMhim  laugh unspeakable joy; where sans Hpetually flare on the Lamb's nar-l riage-tar.

The flower of faith has pelrfumed Afir2i- an's life-weary soul. But the trenchant sword of passion hath beat down the fragile defense of the wolf-child and of the flower- cheeked gamester. Oh! let us toughen this shield of right- directed  enthusiasm  with bull-hide after bull-hide, with  skillful workmanship  of brass, till no scimitar, even devil enchanted, can dint its polished surface; till every wea- pon of-the world's forging be as the blunted ax of a giant in the hand of a child! In his physical person, O'Hara is at home in the house of General Pegram.   Poior the sackcloth and ashes that have dropped on his heart; for the bittcr grief that, like an all-powerful chemical, hias bcen pouredl in his spirit; for the darkness that now envlIops him since the liht frorn her life went down with-that Spring sun in the Vest-he is only at home by that humlble grave at the river- side. Weeks of sorrow have dragged their heavy chariot-wheels over the stricken hearts of the actors in this hbistory. Monnths have   come and vanished, and to all but O'Hara the crushing car of death is fast disappear- ing in the dust of time-time past; and no cloud obscures the sunlight of time future. This book should close now, and the drop scene rattle down to the stage, obscuring the following tableau, to wit: Augustus en- throned in the centre of the show, as in the heart of his family's fond affection; Mrs. Pegram, a penitent queen-mother, robed in black,- sitting at his feet; Dr. and Mrs. ' Hurt, one on each side; on the right, Mark Wilton and blushing first fiancee; on the left, Leopold Wilton and blushing second fiancee; children and servants interspersed promiscuously; bridal cake and wedding- rings; swords wreathed with flowers; all imaginable types of marriage, of war and peace, etc. "Where in the world is Corporal O'Hara?' " demands the audience of these private theat-  ricals-a  public that is very gracious not to  be long since weary.  The manager, thus called to the front, 1 straightway speaks for the exhausted ac- tor:  "i LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: Forgive me for leaving out this character. But, indeed, I t think I  should earlier have served him as t our great tragic poet does Mercutio.-I should v have killed him; in good sooth, I fear he has  killed me!                h "It is about the hour now for him to visit p a  hallowed place in yonder HRrculaneum.

A soiled haversack depends from his shoulder; over its side some tangled vines and flowers bend dejectedly, and as if they envied the freedom of the crushed leaves under his feet. I see his lips move as he repeats the legend of the two angels bearing aloft the radiant, earth-stained woman. He removes the leaves and flowers which have withered on her tomb since the: day before, and re- places them with the fresher rude garland from his haversack. Then he stoops and touches the pure stone with his beard-cov- ered lips; and, gathering up the withered flowers and the book he has been reading,  turns slowly, reluctantly, away. "This morning, I learned that he was r gone, shipped for a whaling cruise." Poor, jolly Irishman-a rough, rich jewel that careless fate has dropped in the bot- tomless ocean!
