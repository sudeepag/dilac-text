TO  This VOLUME IS INSCRIBED WITH THE INCEE 1REDS OF E. L. L.    PREFACE. MANY of the old citizens of Georgetown and Washington will remember the incidents upon which this story is founded, and at once re- cognise the Magdalen of these pages in the still beautiful woman who yet resides in the last-named city. But the stranger who meets her (for she still mingles in the most refined and intellectual circles of Washington society) little dreams that hers has been a life of thrill- ing romance; nor would he realize that one gentle and womanly as, she is now had once been so wayward and imperious. E. L. L. 1*      5     MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. CHAPTER L "No love is like a sisters love, Unselfish, free, and pure, A flame that, lighted from above, Will guide but ne'er allure. It knows no frown of jealous fear, No flush of conscious guile; Its wrongs are pardon'd through a tear, Its hopes erown'd by a smile." wo noble boys and a lovely little girl wandered lislessly about a large and beautiful room. Every thing that could amuse childhood was there; yet they were restless and impatient. "Oh, Grace," broke forth the younger boy, "why don't Aunt Bell come?" "Wait a few minutes and she will be here. Be patient, Fred." "There! she is coming now," exclaimed Clarence. The door opened, and the nurse, Aunt Bell, en- tered the nursery' with an air of mingled mystery and importance, and deposited a bundle of em- 7   8     MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. broidered flannel in the beautiful cradle that stood in the centre of the room. She then turned down the fine shawl and exposed to the gaze of the won- dering group of children a tiny babe. A sweet smile flitted over the face of the innocent sleeper as Grace bent down to imprint a kiss upon its soft round cheek. "Oh, Aunt Bell, what is it?" cried Fred. "What a funny little thing!" "Hush, hush, Freddy!" whispered Clarence; " it is an angel,-an angel to lead us to heaven. Don't you remember that mamma told us we had guardian angels? and this is surely ours." "Yes, I remember," answered the child; "and mamma told me if I did any thing naughty my angel would cry so," and he placed his hand over his eyes and averted his face. "I will be good, for I don't want my angel to cry, but always smile like that: see!" , Again the beautiful smile swept across the features of the sleeping babe, causing the children to hold their breath lest the fair vision should vanish from ,their sight. "Angels have wings," said Grace, with an arch smile. Fred's face clouded, but in a moment it lightened with a triumphant expression, and he exclaimed,- "Yes, but this angel's wings are covered up."   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    9 Aunt Bell, who had been looking on silently, now spoke:- "Hush, chil'n, 'ta'n't no angel, only a poor, little unfortinate, born to sin and to suffer, to live and to die, just like all creeters, black and white. No, honeys, 'ta'n't no angel;-but whenever it smiles so purty the angels is whisperin' to it. The good God sent it to be your little sister. That little thing never 'mitted no sin. Well, chil'n, you must all be like that little child when you die,-in de sperrit, I mean,-no sin on your conscience; and then you can smile too. Mind, chil'n, if you's like that lit- tle innocent you will go to the good place, for the blessed Saviour says, 'Of such is the kingdom of heaven.' It was a beautiful picture! The grand old room, made cheerful by the bright sunlight and elegant furniture; the lovely babe, its dark head resting peacefully on the snowy pillow; the black nurse, speaking so earnestly and impressively to her youth- ful charges, whilst in her manner was mingled the respect of a servant with the tenderness of a mother. The children stood gazing on the babe, listening attentively to their much-loved nurse, and profiting by her humble yet earnest teaching. "I must go now," said Aunt Bell, "but I'll be back to give you your breakfast in a minute." Again Grace bent her head to kiss the soft little   10    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. cheek. Her golden ringlets rested on the babe's face, but it still slept; and Aunt Bell bore it from  the room, leaving the children to talk wonderingly and lovingly of the little stranger. The scene above described was witnessed by Mr. Richmond, who had entered unperceived. "Come hither, Sunbeam," he called to Grace, who still stood beside the cradle whence her sister had been taken. She had unconsciously assumed an attitude carelessly graceful. Her right foot slightly advanced, her head gently inclined, one hand resting on her bosom, with the other she had swept the bright'curls from her fair brow. The heavily- fringed lids veiled the earnest eyes, and the slight form was motionless as a statue. The father gazed on his beautiful daughter with pardonable prides  "Hey, Star-Queen! dreaming again?" So absorbed was she that the first call had not been heard; but -now she looked up with a startled light 'I- her blue eyes. The next instant she sprang to his side, with a clear, ringing' laugh, and buried her tiny white hand in his dark hair.  "Papa, I was dreaming; and, oh, you frightened me so!" "Did I, love? Well, of what were you dream- ing?"  "Of my sister's future, papa."   MAQDA13ENX TlE --E ANTRESS.   " "I suppose you saw nothing but sunshine in the future of your fragile little sister?" said Mr. Rich- mond, smiling.  .  ,   .  "I saw her bright and beautiful and good," an. swered Grace, returning his smile. Mr. Richmond kissed her fondly, then con- tinued: "Now for a name, pet." "Oh, pa, may I give her a name?" cried Grace. "Yes, Star-Queen. But a pretty name, remem- ber." "Let me call her Love." '"A strange name! What put it into your head?" "I don't know: it was just there," answered Grace, naively. And so the babe was called Love. Grace almost idolized Love, and she would sit 'or hours watching the changeful face of her sister. She craved no greater happiness than to be allowed o cradle Love in her arms; and, if the labe hanced to raise its soft, dark eyes to hers and mile, she would laugh merrily in childish glee. Ihe was the guardian angel of the little creature uring, the first five years of, her childhood, ever ratching over her with tenderest care. And trace felt amply repaid by the clinging love of er timid, wayward little sister. Grace was of a ay, cheerful, equal temperament; Love, even in   12    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. her young childhood, was wilful and capricious. There was something in the child's face that im- pressed one with the idea hers would be a life  over which many a dark wave of sorrow would dash. i I   F    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.       13 CHAPTER II. Weep not for those Who sink within the arms of death Ere yet the chilling wintry breath Of sorrow o'er them blows; But weep for them who here remain, The mortal heritors of pain, Condemn'd to see each bright joy fade, And mark grief's melancholy shade Flung o'er Hope's fairest rose.-MRs. EMBURY. ON a snowy-draped, flower-strewn bier lies the notionless form of the second son of the house, loble, high-hearted little Fred. At length the hour for burial has arrived, and, one after another, relatives and friends pressed a last kiss on the white fore- head. Grace bent weepingly over her brother and kissed the cold brow  repeatedly. But when Love was raised from the floor and bade to kiss Fred she smilingly clutched at the flowers instead. But when the little creature, in obedience to Grace's ,w, "Kiss Freddy, Love," touched the pale lips, she drew back and hid her face on her sister's shoulder, and whispered, shudderingly,-- "Oh, Grace, they're so cold!" 2   "    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. When the coffin was lowered and they com- menced filling the grave, Love again clung timidly to Grace, and cried,- "I don't want to die and be put in the ground! and I won't! I won't!" The child was evidently impressed with all the darkness and deformity of the burial of the casket, not realizing that the far more beautiful jewel had been transferred to the crown of the Eternal Sove- reign of Heaven and Earth.          4 In a few days Grace had recovered her usual buoyancy of spirits; but a cloud still shadowed Love's sweet face and darkened her eyes. Years after, while her sister slept peacefully on her pillow, Love, upon closing her eyes, would be haunted by sad memories of her brother. She would try to' relieve her aching heart by tears, but all in vain: the fountain of tears was dried, but the heart-ache would not pass away.  "What is it? what is it? What can the picture mean?" she would exclaim, as she tossed restlessly upon her sleepless couch. "I see the bier as it looked when Fred rested cold and motionless upon it: in a moment he disappears, and Grace's golden  curls are reposing in his stead; then suddenly she fades from view to give place to Clarence; and-oh, horrible!-the drapery is no longer pure and white, but blood-stained!"Then she would cover her face   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.     15 shudderingly, try to banish the fearful visions, and pray in agony for the blessing of sleep. Sometimes these visions were so vivid that she would raise herself on her arm and gaze eagerly in her sister's calm and beautiful face, to assure herself they were not real. ,   16    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. CHAPTER III. "A look of scorn hath led to hate; A kindly smile hath won a heart." "MAGDALEN, my child, you appalme by your un- governable temper!" A young girl, scarce fifteen, was standing before her mother, with cheeks paling and [eyes flashing in a manner which bespoke an approaching or past storm. "Mother, it is shameful that Grace Richmond, with her baby face, should be preferred to me not only by the school but by our teachers. I was the originator of this scheme: it was opposed at first, but I persevered; and, having at length won Grace and Love Richmond's powerful influence, I con- sidered every thing would go off as I, in my own mind, had planned it. I, as the reigning school- beauty, would be queen; Grace Richmond, as the favorite," (this was spoken with scornful emphasis,) "and Agnes O'Niel, as the favorite's friend, would be my maids of honor. But it was decided we should elect a queen, and that fair-haired folly, Grace Richmond, was selected without one single   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    17 dissenting voice, and HMagdalen Shelby, an heiress and a bea[ty---was honored by being pronounced, with the same unanimity of voice, worthy to serve her highness. And, mark you, mother, I will not be present." "But, my child, should you refuse the proffered honor and decline attending the party, every one would attribute your refusal to disappointment because you were not chosen queen." "True," she muttered: "I will be obliged to go; but I will make Grace Richmond weep bitter tears before she dies. She is preferred by teachers and scholars, and, I have sometimes feared, even by Neville. Ah, I will not be rivalled there! I am glad Love is but a child, for she will be gloriously beautiful, and I might fear her; but Neville Heath shall be mine long before she will have love- dreams." Magdalen stood by the window and gazed into the quiet streets, till she was aroused by a group of maidens, who, with their attendants, bade her join them in a moonlight walk. "Whither away, ladies fair?" cried Magdalen, as she joined the gay party, all trace of the recent storm having passed away. "Whithersoever our fair queen commands," an- swered Neville Heath, bowing with boyish gallantry to Grace, who leaned upon his arm. B        22* .   18    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. Grace .w the gathering cloud on Magdalen's brow, and smilingly answered,- "Beauty should take precedence of royalty in this dear land of ours; and besides, sir, in our court the heart, not the lips, must speak. Lead on." She with- drew her hand from. Neville's arm, and left them alone. Magdalen fancied that Neville's eyes looked after Grace with an expression rather uncomplimentary to herself; but the fancy was soon dispelled when he turned to her with his wonted air of graceful gal- lantry. "I look forward to to-morrow eve, Miss Mag- dalen, with bright anticipations of pleasure." "And why, Neville?" "Because I love to dance," he answered, pro- vokingly. "Ah!"She deigned no further comment; and  there was silence between them till one of the girls asked her where they were to go. "To the mill," she briefly replied. As soon as the merry group ascertained the spot designated, a harum-scarum race began, and Mag- dalen and Neville were left far behind their com- panions. "What think you of our queen's dignity?" in- quired Magdalen, as Grace bounded past them, her   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    19 fair curls blown back by a gentle breeze, and her sweet face all aglow. Grace was always more noted for goodness than dignity," answered Neville, laughing. "Had you been chosen to reign," he added, in a tone that thrilled her heart, "how regally you would have worn the diadem!" "You are partial," said Magdalen, bending her stately head. "Yes, I am partial," he answered, meaningly. They walked slowly onwardi conversing in low tones. As they approached the mill, no one was visible save Grace, who was leaning against a tree and gazing pensively upon the stars. She looked so bewitchingly lovely that Neville could not resist the temptation to spring forward and give her a kiss. Grace started and gave a slight scream; but, perceiving the smiliAg lips of the audacious offender and the scornful glances of Magdalen's eyes, she blushed deeply and burst into tears. Neville was astonished and alarmed at the serious termination of his sport, and, taking Grace's hand in both of his, he proceeded to apologize. "I did not imagine for an instant, Grace, that my harmless kiss would so offend you." "Neither did I think you would so insult me," said poor Grace, sobbingly. "But, Grace, I could not help it: you have no right   20    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. to look so pretty if you won't be kissed. Forgive me this time, Gracie, and I will never repeat the offence,-if I can help it," said Neville, playfully. But Grace still wept, and Neville exclaimed, despair- ingly,- "In pity, Grace, tell me what I must do to con- vince you of my penitence. Bid me throw myself into the mill-stream, and I will obey to win your forgiveness. Ah, thank you: that smile is worth to me a monarch's diadem!" he exclaimed, as a bright smile broke over Grace's face. "I was very foolish to take it so seriously, Ne- ville, but I never dreamed that you--" "Please don't cry again. Your tears almost drive me distracted," interrupted Neville, as Grace's eyes filled with tears. Magdalen, who had been standing unheeded, ex- claimed, sneeringly,- "Quite a lovers' quarrel, on my word! and, as there is almost a reconciliation, I -will be, in an instant, de trop." She bowed haughtily, and turned to rejoin her companions. This unladylike remark sent the quick blood to Grace's face, and she was on the point of making a cutting reply; but, remembering that Magdalen had seen and heard enough to make her feel a little jealous and irritable, she checked herself, and only exclaimed, reproachfully,--   I MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    21 "Magdalen!" Neville allowed the remark to pass unnoticed, and tley were soon after joined by Agnes O'Niel. Agnes yas of the same age as Magdalen; but she looked &t least a year older. She was attired in a black dress, which, being cut low, exposed her fair 'neck and shoulders. The thick, dark-brown hair was pushed carelessly back from her noble forehead and confined by a shell comb. Her eyes, large and of a deep gray color, wore an expression of unusual softness, A quietness amounting almost to gravity usually characterized her. She seldom smiled; but, when the firmly-closed lips parted and the soft eyes brightened to greet one whom she loved, the sha- dowy cloud was lifted, and the gleaming sunshine broke brightly forth. -' Your loyal subjects bade me seek your majesty and humbly beg that you join them at the bridge," said Agnes, as she joined Grace. "I am willing and ready to accede to their peti- tion," answered Grace, in the same spirit, attempting to withdraw her hand, which Neville had placed within his arm; but he prevented her. "I have forgiven you the kiss, Neville," whispered Grace, hurriedly, "and you must not consider your- self bound to treat me with more attention than usual." He smiled, but still retained her hand.   22    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "There is our brilliant beauty leaning against yon tree, in a deep reverie, unconscious---" "Seemingly unconscious," interrupted Neville, half impatiently. "Grace, I wish to walk with you: may I?" "No, no: I would rather have you accompany Magdalen: it will wound her should you not." A strange feeling of dreariness filled her heart as he released her hand and walked slowly to Magda- len's side. She had unconsciously hoped he would not go. "I am not beautiful nor an heiress like Magdalen; but, oh, she does not love him as I do!" Thus musing, Grace, accompanied by Agnes, walked silently toward the bridge. 5   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.     23 CHAPTER IV. The bright and youthful dancers meet, With laughing lips and winged feet,  And golden locks come flashing by, Like sudden sunshine through the sky. MBS. ESSLING. THE sun shone radiantly on the day appointed for the May-party, and at two o'clock P M. the spacious school-room was filled with old and young. A beautiful throne had been erected by the united efforts of the youths and maidens. The desks and benches had been removed, and every thing was in readiness for the coronation and the dance that was to follow. At a sign from the teacher, one of the girls struck up a march, and the fair queen elect, preceded and followed by her attendants, entered the room. She advanced to the foot of the throne, where she was crowned by the archbishop. She was seated in the chair of state, after deliver. ing her poetic inaugural, and the members of her court, one after another, knelt at her feet and kissed her hand in token of allegiance. When this ceremony was finished, the gay com- pany joined merrily in dances, game, or song, as each listed.   24    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.  At six o'clock, the younger children were sent home, but the elder ones pleaded to be permitted to - dance till ten.  Neville had devoted himself to Grace, and Mag- dalen, although mortified and wretched at the pub- lie preference shown for another by one whom she had so long held in subjection. by her glorious  beauty and artful fascinations, was far too proud to allow these feelings to be manifested.  There was one, however, who was not to be deceived by her gay and careless demeanor, and  this one was a handsome youth of nineteen or twenty, with a spirit proud and haughty as her own  flashing from his great black eyes. Henry Calvert, attracted by the powerful fascinations of wealth and loveliness, offered his hand to the young heiress, and had been unhesitatingly and sccvfully rejected. He detected her real uneasiness underAher assumed gayety, and rejoiced in it. Once during the evening almost the entire com- pany had gathered around the piano to hear Grace and KNeville sing ,a duet. Magdalen, glad to be alone and unobserved for a brief time, threw herself on a tte-.t4te with a deep respiration which sounded almost like a sob.  "Whence that deep-drawn sigh, Misf Shelby?" sounded, in a low, mocking voice, directly beside her.   .. a n tCI'AANTRESS.  2 She started, but, immediately recovering herself, answered, coldly,--  "I sighed, Mr. Calvert, from very weariness of being compelled to entertain every fool that chooses to approach me." "I hope," observed he, without betraying the least emotion, " that you do not intend to place me in your category of fools?" "I do not," she answered; "you are far from being a fool; but---" "But not so far from being a knave, you would add." "Make your own inferences," she observed. "But why do you leave the queenly rose to seek the humble violet?" "Because the violet, though lowly and modest, is sweet," he answered. She felt the sarcasm, and her eyes drooped be- neath his, but immediately said, with a light laugh,-- "Pardon me: I spoke carelessly. My nature par- takes more of the nettle: violets do not sting." [ She was amply avenged. He turned absolutely white with anger. A retort was prevented by the approach of Grace und Neville. "I come, Miss Magdalen," said Neville, "to beg ou to honor me by permitting me to escort you 3 ;  ,  , ' * !l   26    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. home. I am at your disposal whenever you feel inclined to leave these halls of light." "Tlank you: Mr. Calvert will attend me," an- swered Magdalen, with a sweet smile and graceful inclination of the head. "Pity me!" he exclaimed, turning to Grace with a meaning glance and smile. "I do," she answered, blushing; for, truth to tell, he had begged the privilege of attending her, and she had refused unless Magdalen should decline his escort. "Aha!" cried Magdalen's exulting heart, " he is only tormenting me by flirting with my rival. It is my turn now: and shall I use my power lightly? Ah, no!" Days and months sped, yet he returned not to his allegiance. Magdalen's proud heart ached when she thought, had she acted with a gentler and more womanly spirit on that fatal night when Neville kissed Grace at the old mill, things might have been far different. ?

"Farewelll my lips may wear a careless smile, My words may breathe the very sou of lightness; But the touch'd heart must deeply feel, the while, THREE years have fed; and Magdalen Shelby is again standing before her mother with a clouded brow. "Mother, is this not adding insult to injury? Was it not enough that she won him from me? And yet, to gain a more glorious triumph, she makes me her third bridesmaid!" "But, Magdalen, you have played your part so well, no one suspects you are breaking your heart for Neville Heath." "Breaking my heart! ha! ha!" she laughed, bit- terly, and then continued :-"Do I look broken- hearted? No, no! but hers shall break, if such a thing be possible, and that ere many years. It is as you say: no one suspects I love Neville: so I must continue the farce, that suspicion may not be aroused. But listen and remember: in five years I will- be Neville Heath's wife."   28    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. What do you mean, Magdalen? Are you de- ranged?" "Iam perfectly sane, and know what I am say- ing. In five years I will be his wife." "But there is no probability of Grace's dying." "By no means. But there are many ways of getting rid of a rival,-divorce or poison." "Oh, Magdalen, you frighten me! You do not know what you are saying!" "Ah! do I not? Many times, during the past year I have thought of killing her; but that would be too slight a revenge for what she has caused me to suffer. Listen to me, and I will unfold to you my plans. To-morrow night he marries her: during the evening I will manage to let him see how pas- sionately I love him. It will flatter his vanity to believe I am breaking my heart for him, and I will soon manage to make his conquest. I have always found less difficulty in winning a woman's husband than her lover. I will let Grace live till she has suffered a thousand deaths: then he shall murder her." Mrs. Shelby, though somewhat awed by her wild words, laughed, for she thought it only the mean- ingless raving of a disappointed girl; and she said,- "You are either mad or jesting, Magdalen."   !:.!   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    29 "I am not mad; and God knows I am not jest- i  ing," replied the daughter. The trembling form, quivering lips, and flashing eyes attested the truth of her words. Her mother, who was a weak-minded woman, with many faults and foibles, tenderly loved her only child and deeply sympathized with her sorrow. She drew the aching head down upon her bosom, and murmured, caressingly,- "He is unworthy your love, my beautiful child. This is a passing fancy, such as girls have a hundred times in their lives. And, besides, you must never condescend to wed a simple American citizen. We are going to Europe, you know; and I will yet see a diadem upon my darling's bright brow." The girl had raised her head and sat silent until her mother ceased speaking: then she suddenly threw herself upon the floor, and cried, passion- ately,-- "Mother, mother, I am not, mad, but you will make me so! I would not forego a single smile of Neville for the crown of an empress! I hate the world, and every thing in it but Neville. If he would say to me to-night, 'Magdalen, my love, my heart, my soul, are yours, but I must marry your rival, from imperative reasons,' mother, I would be satisfied." "Perhaps, my child," said the would-be com- 3*   80    MAGDALEN TIlE ENCHANTRESS. forter, catching at a straw, "he does love you. Indeed, how can he help loving-aye, worshipping- you?" "No, mother: he is infatuated with the silly, doll. baby face of Grace Richmond." "If he can stoop to love her, I repat, he is un- worthy your love." Magdalen sprang from the floor, and, drawing up her slight and elegant figure to its fullest height, exclaimed, in tones that frightened her mo- ther,- "Silence Do you dare to call him unworthy? He is all that is noble; and if he loves her it is through her devilish blandishments." The door opened, and Agnes O'Niel was an- nounced. Magdalen went gayly and gracefully to meet her, not a single trace of the recent storm remaining, except her disarranged hair, which had escaped from confinement when she threw her- self upon the floor. She shook her Ibng, black tresses back from her brow, and apologized by say- ing,- "You must excuse my appearance, Ag: I had just taken down my hair to see if I would look as well ii curls as braids. You know, as I am to be one of Grace's bridemaidens, I feel anxious to look as beautiful as possible."   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    81 "You are always beautiful, Magdalen," answered Agnes. "Braids or curls, it is all the same." -  As Agnes was also to be one of Grace's at- tendants, the two girls launched into all the mys- teries of the minutia of a bridal toilette: so we will not intrude upon them nor listen to their dis- cussion.

We'll miss her when we gather round Our blazing hearth at night, When fond and pensive thoughts abound, Or when all hopes unite; And pleasant talk of years to come,- Those years our fancies frame:  Ah, she has now another's home, And bears another's name."-SoNo. THE large drawing-room of Mr. Richmond's beau- tiful town residence was filled with guests impa- tiently awaiting the entrance of the party to be wedded. After the usual delay which occurs on such occasions, the bridal pair, accompanied by their attendants, entered, and the marriage rites proceeded. When the benediction was being pronounced, there was a cry that one of the .bridesmaids had fainted. Neville, being nearer her than the other gentlemen, raised her from the floor. The com- pany had now crowded round, making inquiries and offering assistance. "She must have air, Neville," whispered Grace. "Follow me."   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    33 He bore the fainting girl into an adjoining room and placed her on a couch. Then, and not till then, he recognised the white upturned face, and ex- claimed,- "Grace, it is Magdalen Shelby!" Grace was entering the room, having been de- tained a moment to procure a restorative. "Magdalen Shelby, Neville? Impossible! I have heard her say a hundred times that she had never fainted in the greatest extremity of pain or terror." ^ "Poor Magdalen I she is as one dead now." "What could have caused this, Neville?" "I have not the least idea. Perhaps she has been ill." "No: I never saw her appearing better than she did an hour since. She was in high spirits, and her face was perfectly radiant." "It must have been the heated atmosphere that caused her to faint. But see! she is recovering. I will go now and send Agnes to you." Magdalen pressed her hands tightly over her heart, and murmured,- "Crushed! crushed!" "What is it, dear Magdalen?" inquired Grace, smoothing her hair with a caressing motion. The large eyes flew open, and she pushed Grace from her, crying,-. c   84    MAGDALEN tHE ENCHANTREBS. "Go away, Grace Richmondl It is not well for you to be alone with me." "Poor Magdalen I her mind is wandering," said Grace, tears gathering in her eyes. "I am your friend, dear Magdalen,-your friend, Grace Rich- mond, or rather," continued Grace, thinking to re- call her, "Grace Heath. I have no right to the name of Richmond now, you know--" Magdalen started up and laid her hand heavily on Grace's white shoulder. "4 Do you dare gloat over your victim, false friend, traitress?" The usual soft, low voice was utterly changed, and- the words came hoarsely through the laetched teeth. Poor Grace sat motionless with fright, thinking, shudderingly, that she was alone with a maniac, who might be provoked to murder her should she make a single movement to escape. She was relieved from the horrible fear that posseo ed her by the entrance of Agnes and Neville.  "I am glad to see you recovered, Miss Magalen said the latter, bending over her.  She raised her wild eyes to his, and murmured,- You have broken my heart, Neville: yes, it is broken, brenbroken!"And her voice die away in a low, wailing cadence, as she again clasp d her Is  hands ovtrbher heart and wearily closed her eyes. She is insane, Neville;' whispered Grace cling- s:    MAQDALESN THE ENCHANTRESS.   85 ing tremblingly to her husband's arm: "she fright- enad me altost to death with her ravings when you left me alone with her." Magdalen's quick ear caught the whispered words, and she exclaimed,-- "Insane! Raving I 'Well, if I am mad, 'twas you that made me so." She was silent for a mo- ment, but, suddenly changing, she sai" plaintively, "Take me home I take me home 1" "Grace, I will go myself and bring her mother to her," said Neville, "and we will be guided by her." "I am afraid of her, Neville." And poor Grace clung to his arm, "Nonsense, Grace I she is too ill to harm you if she would." He left the room, and Grace sat down beside Magdalen. The girl was perfectly quiet for a little while; but she suddenly startled her companions by grasping Grace's hand and peering into the pink palm. "It is a pretty hand, lady,-a pretty hand. Would you know the fortune it reveals to me? Nay, nay, I must read your destiny," she said, as the terrified bride attempted to withdraw her hand. "Humor her, Grace," whispered Agnes. "Give me a good fortune, maiden," said Grace, yielding her hand. "I will read you your fortune, lady, as this little   36    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. hand reveals it to me. It is not for the poor gypsy maiden to make or mar fortunes: she can only reveal them as they are written, to those who would know their destiny. But listen: your future can be summed up in a few words. You are a fair, beauteous, and loved bride: the world seems bright before you. But, oh, how delusive the hopes of this life! Your husband will love you for a brief period: then that love will be transferre to another. You will live a most wretched life for a few years: then you will die by poison administered by the hand of your husband! ha, ha! A bright fortune, my beau- teous bride! You cannot escape it; it is your fate! ha, ha, ha!" Peal after peal of wild laughter filled the room; as the mad girl kept her gaze fixed upon the dilated eyes and white face of the poor bride, whom she was tormenting so cruelly. She sat motionless, fascinated, as it were, by Magdalen's glittering eyes. It seemed as if the veil of the future had been lifted, and she saw herself, looking scarce older than her present self, lying dead within her coffin. The spell was broken- by the sound of approaching footsteps, and in a moment Mrs. Shelby, accom- panied by a physician, entered the room. The physician decided Magdalen Would better be taken home. She was soon placed in a carriage, and, with her mother and the physician, was driven home.   MAGDALRN THE BNCHANTRBSS.    87 There were many conjectures regarding the cause of Magdalen's fainting. Many reasons were as. signed, but none suspected the true cause, save Neville. He could not be mistaken longer in re- gard to Magdalen's feelings toward himself. That one glance, and the passionate "Neville, you have broken my heart! it is broken, broken broken!" had revealed all. And how did that revelation affect him? Alas! he was but mortal man, and his emotions were those of flattered vanity, mingled with pity for the elegant and beautiful girl who had been the heroine of his first boyish love, and over whose life he had cast a shadow for a time, perhaps forever. If the truth must be told, Neville, at this moment, thought more of the dark, brilliant beauty of the woman whose love for him was now a sin, than of the fair loveliness of his pure young bride. 4   38    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS;  , j  CHAPTER VAI. "Some griefs the strongest soul might shake; And I 1ualh griefs have had: My brain is hot, but they mistake  Who deem that I am mad." WHEN Magdalen was carriedinto the parlor and gently placed in a large chair bty the good doctor, the color had returned to: her lips, and the wild light had died out of her eyes. "How do you feel now, my child?" inquired he, placing his fingers upon her wrist and counting the pulse-beats. "Much better, I thank you, Dr. Linton. My pulse is all right, Iiguess." "Yes, nearly right. But what caused my stout- hearted little Magdalen to swoon in such style and in the presence of so many persons?" "Well, doctor, I can scarcely tell. I had felt very well,-indeed, better than usual; and I am heartily ashamed of this public display of weakness.' cIt was from over-excitement and the heated rooms, I suppose. You would better allow your good mother to put you comfortably to bed: you will be well enough to attend all the balls and par-   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.:   39 ties that will be given in honor of this wedding.

When the door closed upon the retiring form of the doctor, Mrs. Shelby gazed inquiringly upon her daughter. "Well, Magdalen?" "Well, mother?"  ' Pray, what does this mean?". "It means the Fates favored me, and I have taken the first step in my revenge. I was so fortunate as to faint at the conclusion of the marriage ceremony, and was borne from the room in the arms of Neville Heath. When I recovered my consciousness, I played the crazy maiden, and very nearly frightened Mistress Heath out of her wits by pretending my whimsical madness had taken the- form of prophecy. As for Neville, he knows how entirely my heart is his." "Magdalen, have your maidenly pride and delicacy taken leave of you, as well as your senses?" cried poor Mrs. Shelby, much shocked. "Nay, nay, mother," answered the girl, coolly, "I was mad: I knew not what I said or did."   40    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "My child, are you determined, to attempt to carry out this mad scheme?" "I intend to attempt it, and am determined to succeed." "Magdalen, are you possessed of a demon?" "I neither know nor care," she answered, reck- lessly. "I only know I would sacrifice any thing, every thing, to win the love of Neville Heath." "And will nothing turn you from your pur- pose?" "Nothing." Mrs. Shelby sighed and looked grave. Magdalen kissed her mother's cheek' lightly and bade her good-night. Magdalen feigned illness for two or three weeks, and coaxed Dr. Linton, with whom she was a great favorite, into abetting the deceit, by telling him she wished it to appear that she had fainted from sudden illness. "I have a good reason for wishing it to appear that this fainting was occasioned by physical suffer- ing," she urged, coaxingly. "Well, well, tell me the true reason, and I'll pledge myself to help you on with this plotting. Come; what is it?" "Ill-natured'people might say, you know, that Magdalen Shelby was certainly wild about Neville Heath, or she would never have swooned at his   MAGDAtEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   4 wedding.

"I fear you are the last, my kind old friend," thought Magdalen; " but there will be many others who think themselves far wiser, to keep you com- pany." "You won't betray me?" she asked, laughingly, as he to6k his hat to go. "No, my child, I'll keep this mournful secret," returned the old gentleman, laughing at the good joke ..          .    ,  ' 4* L.   42    MAGDALEN THE ENCUANTRESS. CHAPTER VIII.

THzEE months after Grace Richmond's wedding, a gay party was assembled at Neville Seath's beau- tiful country-seat. The leaves were falling; but the Heaths and their guests still lingered, uwilling to return to the noise and confusion of city life. The entire party, consisting of the host and hostess, Agnes O'Niel, Magdalen Shelby, Kate Dunnington, Henry Calvert, Clarence Richmond, and Willie Cal- vert, sat in the wide hall planning a picnic to the Great Falls of the Potomac. Ie   RIt was finally decided they should go on horse- back, and would have a dance inthe ball-room that had been erected for the purpose of accommodating the many excursionists who visit this beautiful spot "And now, gentlemen, you must engage you partners," said Neville. The young gentlemen, as with one accord, spran forward and begged the honor of escorting Grace   MAGDALEN THE ENOHANTRESS.    43 but she, with woman's ready tact, read the heart of each, and placed her hand in that of Willie Cal- vert, whom she knew had no lady-love present; and she moreover suspected him of a half-fancy for her sister Love, who was absent at school. Clarence had already appropriated Agnes, and Henry Calvert approached Kate. As he passed Magdalen, he whispered,-  "Am  I not generous to resign you and escort that little Kate Dunnington, thus afbording you an unobserved parting interview with your lover ere you leave for Europe?" He did not wait to note the effect of his words, but passed on to where Kate was seated. "Well, Miss Shelby, this is an'unexpeeted plea- sure," said Neville; then added, in a lower tone, that was heard only by Grace, Willie, and herself, '"I am astonished that the young gentlemen should leave the brightest flower to a Benedict like me." The tones were those of common compliment, but they fell on Grace's heart like a knell. Poor bride! although she and Magdalen had laughed fifty imes over the events of the memorable wedding- eve, Grace could not help feeling a little heavy. hearted when her husband paid Magdalen any little attention that would have passed unnoticed had it been directed toward any other lady. She waited tremblingly for Magdalen's reply.   "    MAGDALEN THE ENCitANTRESS.  "I am most happy to accept, you as my true and loyal knight," answered Magdalen, in the same tone that he had used;: but there was a world of love in the beautiful eyes that gazed into his. The glance thrilled his heart, but he made a light reply and turned to Grace. He: flushed slightly as he met her eyes, in which tears had gathered. He pressed her hand and whispered,-  Why, dearest I believe you are half jealous of your lovely friend,'-.  "Oh, Neville, do you think you will always love me?" "I know I shall always . ove you, dearest. But why do you ask such a question?'"  "I have never succeeded ;:idriving: wtay entirely the unpleasant impression made on my mind-by Magdalen's prophecy."  - "Nonsense, Grace! Why, what your friend said was in the delirium of fever4 You know she was ill for two or three weeks after that night." Grace smiled sadly, and sOk her head. "Must 'I still play the over, sweet?" asked Ne- ville, raising her white han o islips. Yes, yes, Neville:-play the lover as long as your heart prompts," she answered, smiling brightly, her faith in his love entirely restored.  This little episode was unnoticed by .all save   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    45 Henry Calvert and Magdalen, who were standing together apparently absorbed in each other. "My lady seems jealous," remarked Calvert "She has cause," answered Magdalen.  "He loves me, although he knows it not." "Do you dare to boast that you have won the love of a man who has been married but three little months?" "I am not apt to boast without good reason." "And what will this love bring you?" asked he, significantly. "Honor and happiness." "Honor and happiness, and he the wedded hus- band of another?" "Yes. I sail for Europe in the next steamer: she is a delicate creature, and may fade from the earth in a few years." "Particularly if a certain fair friend of hers, who shall be nameless, being solicitous about preserving her beauty, should employ a well-known agent called arsenic." The pale cheek grew paler as he thus read her secret thoughts; but she answered, with perfect self- possession,- "I know of no one base enough to commit such a crime but yourself." "Suppose we cease hostilities for a brief while and make ourselves agreeable to each other?"   "    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "That were an utter impossibility."  "Pardon- me :- meant seemingly agreeable. i ,-T0 begin: do you know that the world sall fi^en- gaged?"      ;  "Engaged! and to you     : ;    ; *"  "To -me.'

'  "Well?"     i  "But you do not know that I was deeply in love with Grade Richmond, and was refused three times."       -  "Ah!" (with a slight accent ofsurprise.) "Well?"

His motives will be re- vealed hereafter.  The day appointed ifori the excursion to the Great Falls proved to be pleasant, and, at an; early hour,   MAGDALEN THE BECHANTRBSS.    47 a large party of the neighboring gentry were assembled at Neville Heath's preparatory to start- ing. Neville and Magdalen led the brilliant cavalcade. Both being bold and fearless equestrians, and mounted on excellent horses; they. soon, left their companions far behind. Magdalen showed to pecu-. liar advantage on horseback; and, as we have never described our heroine, we will attempt it now. er beauty was of thebrunettetype proper,-.a style seldom seen. Her complexion was white and smooth, without the slightest tinge of rose tinting her cheek. Even when agitated by any passing emotion, her face, instead of flushing, grew whiter. She uaoally wore her abundant, bluish-black tresses wound. in. braids about her small head. Her lips were beautifully chiselled, and ruby red; but her mouth and chin wore an expression of cold cruelty. We carce :dare attempt a description of her eyes. They were large, dark, and very beautiful. They could; flash: ad glitter, with: nger, melt with pity, or:beam;uputterable love, with the rapidity of light. ning. It was .to these wondrous eyes, through which she could speak any language she chose, her heart remaning :untouched by any emotion the me aw hil e tat :she .owed her strange power of fascination. She was proud,' cold, and haughty. She had many secret enemies, though she was too   48    MAGDALbN THB ENCHANTRESS. much feared to have any open ones. She fre- quently boasted to her mother that she could fas- cinate any man she willed; and she never failed, but once. bWhen Neville and Magdalen were full a mile ahead of their companions, Magdalen proposed they should gallop back to meet them. In turning sud- denly, her horse started, and she was thrown to the ground. Neville dismounted-instantly but she had already sprung up. pAre you injured, Magdalen?" he inquired, as soon as he approached her. "Only very slightly," she answered. "Do you feel equal to walking forward with my assistance? Our friends will be seriously alarmed by seeing our horses riderless." "'Oh, yes."* She placed her hand upon his offered arm, and they walked slowly forward.  "Magdalen," he asked, abruptly, "how is it that you can give your heart to Calvert, who does not appreciate either your intellect or beauty?" "I have promised him my hand; but he knows my heart can never be given a second time." "I have half suspected, Magdalen, that you had loved unhappily. Is it so8? "It is true. But   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    49 "Twere better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all, ' she answered, sadly. "Magdalen, Magdalen, who could have cast your great love away?" he cried.           . "Spare me, Neville: I have sometimes feared my eyes would betray to him this humiliating, sinful secret, for he is lost to me forever: he is married." She would have fallen had he not thrown his arm around her. Obeying a mad impulse, he clasped her tightly to his bosom and kissed her quivering lips, crying repeatedly,- "Magdalen, oh, Magdalen! what'a fatal, fatal mistake I have made! Too late. I discover I cherish my first love still!" She recalled him to himself by a sudden burst of tears. He withdrew his arm from about her waist and strove to calm her. "Oh, Neville, I have prayed to be spared this humiliation, and my lonely exile will be doubly dark when I think of you suffering too." "And do you think that by placing the ocean between us you can divide our hearts?" "I am going to investigate the Catholic religion, and, if I can become a convert, I shall enter a con- vent and try to find peace, if nothing more." "And Henry Calvert?" "I have engaged myself to him with the under- D        5   60    MAGDALEN THB ENCHANTRESS. standing that, if at the altar I should find myself unequal to the sacrifice, he will release me. I know I shall never marry him."  At this instant their friends came within sight, and in a moment Henry Calvert was beside them. Their horses were soon brought by Willie Calvert and another youth; and Magdalen, who assured him that she had sustained but trifling injury, was tenderly assisted into the saddle by Henry Calvert, and they rode the remainder of the distance in com- pany.           ,       r "Well, Miss Dunnington," said Grace, "it seems Henry and Magdalen have made up their lovers' quarrel, and you will have to be consoled by Willie here for the loss of his brother. As for me," she continued, "I have already so nearly lost 'my hus- band to-day I intend to keep him near me." These words fell on Neville's ear like a ireproach; and he almost hated Grace for making him feel like the guilty wretch he was. "Grace, do you know for what purpose Magdalen visits Italy?" he inquired. "To enjoy herself, I suppose." "She is going to become a CathOlic and a nun." "Thank Heaven!" exclaimted Grace, involun- tarily. "Grace," he said, in tones she had never heard from his lips, "is it by indulging in this foolish and   MAGDALEN THE, ENCHANTRESS.    51 groundless jealousy that you will retain your hus- band's love?". 'Neville, do not speak to me so harshy. I can-. not help my feelings." "Then do not annoy me bya manifestation of them," he answered, coldly. . The tears sprang into the gentle eyes of the wife; but her heart was so full that she dared not-speak, lest she should give cause for further unkindness, Neville's naturally honorable and noble nature reproached him for his conduct, when he reflected he had sought and won his truenhearted Grace but to repay her devotion with neglect and unkindness. He resolved to tell her. all, and exert himself to crush out his love for Magdalen and bestow it where it was rightly due. "I must tell her to-day," he said, mentally, "or I shall lack the courage." When they had reached their destination, the girls sought the dressing-room to change their riding-habits for dresses more suitable to dancing. Neville detained Grace, drew her arm through his, and led her to a retired seat. 'He here humbled himself,-told her how he had loved Magdalen when a boy,'how- his love for. her had, as he be- lieved, passed fore  from her to Grace. He then told her he had never dreamed that Magdalen loved him, until she fainted when he was married, and he never knew it until this day. He concluded by tell-   W2    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. 52  - MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. ing her thante had compelled Magdalen to acknow- ledge it, and dwelt en her anguish and pure-hearted- ness until poor Grace could endure no more, and cried, in anguish,- "Neville, oh, Neville, why did you marry me? Why did you deceive me by feigning to love me when your heart was so entirely another's?" "I swear to you, on my honor, Grace, when I promised to love you I was perfectly sincere." "Then this bold, bad, artful girl has won my hus- band's love. O God! let me die! let me die!" And Grace bowed like a broken reed, in this her first great woe. "Grace, you do not know the lovely girl whomn you stigmatize as 'bold, bad, artful.' Could you have/ seen her, as I did, humbled to the dust, ac- knowledging her love, her shame, "her agony, you would pity rather than condemn." "It was all acting! O God! let me die! let me die!" moaned Grace. "But, when I forgot myself and you, and spoke burning words, 'twas she that recalled me, and, ,noble girl that she is, thought only of my suffer- ing, and prayed that, when she should enter the cloister where she hoped to find peace, we might be happy." "It was all acting. She will never enter a con- vent. She will go away a brief while, but she will   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    53 return. Her prophecy will be fulfilled. Already I feel the coffin enclosing my dead form, and hear the clods of earth falling on my hosom. But, oh, Ne- ville, you will not poison me, as she said? I am not afraid to die; but you will notpoison me?"And she looked into his face with her blue eyes full of in- quiring agony. "Grace, Grace," he said, vainly trying to quell the storm lhe had raised, 'Magdalen will become a nun, and my wild love for her will pass like a dream. I have told you all, thinking it my duty, and I expected you to bear it like a strong-minded, patient woman; but instead you sob and moan, clasp your hands, and say wild words, like a broken- hearted, despairing girl mourning over the incon- stancy of a lover."      . "And is the loss of a husband's love so light a cloud on a woman's heart?" "Nay, nay," he said, glad to see her more calm, "but you have not lost your husband's love without hope of Its return. I will pray as earnestly as you can do for my heart to turn again to you. Only be patient." ,         - "I will try to be patient, as you wish, Neville, and perhaps God will, in pity, let me die: then you may be happy." "I tell you, Gracej were you to die to-morrowT I would never marry Magdalen.  And, were it even 6*   54    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. possible I could think of -suh a thing, she would drive me from her presence with scorn." Grace shook her head in utter unbelief of the latter part of the sentence, and rose to go, saying,- "I honor you for the course you have pursued in regard to me, although it' seems almost a cruel kindness. The world shall believe me the happy wife I was two hours since." "I doubt it not, dear Grace. All will yet be well, believe me." "I trust it may," she answered; "and yet," she mentally exclaimed, "I feel assured you are, de- ceiving yourself. I do not doubt the sincerity of your honorable purpose, my husband, but you, like all whom she determines shall yield to her, will be charmed into her toils by the singular power of fascination she possesses." No one who witnessed the light-hearted gayety of Grace, the graceful gallantry of Neville, and the brilliant elegance of Magdalen, as they mingled with the dancers on that day, would have deemed that they werp all utterly wretched: yes, even Mag- -dalen, although she had triumphed thus far, feared that, when she had withdrawn the dangerous fasci- nation of her presence, Neville, with his high sense of honor, would succeed in breaking the spell that bound him. Two weeks after the events just narrated, Magda-   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    55 len, accompanied by her mother, sailed for Europe. And no one suspected the bride of a few months was less happy than she seemed. Grace and Neville never referred to this day; yet in their secret souls it was an ever-present guest. Grace was oppressed with what she felt was inevi- table; and Neville vainly strove to banish the sad memory of the haunting eyes and slender grief- bowed form of his temptress. He invariably treated Grace with the tenderest care. This was far more alarming than indifference or unkindness, for she felt that hil tenderness proceeded from pity and remorse, not from returning love.   56    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. CHAPTER IX. She .as e , 'lk A dream of poetry, that may not be . Written 0r told,-.exceedieg beantifuLn-WILUsB THE sun flashed in golden radiance over the city of Washington on the slt of January, 18-. The broad streets and avenues were filled with ladies and gentlemen wending their way to the Presidential mansion for the purpose of paying their respects to the Chief Magistrate of the United States, as is the annual custom. At half-past twelve, a handsome equipage drove up to the archway. A gentleman sprang out and assisted two ladies to alight. The elder lady we recognise as Mrs. Neville Heath, looking scarcely older than when she stood before the altar a little more than two years ago. But who is the won- drously beautiful girl that accompanies her? We cannot be mistaken in the identity of the large, dark, melancholy eyes. Yes, it is Love Richmond. She has just finished her education, and she is pro- nounced, by the voice of Madame M. of New York, fitted to grace the fashionable world.   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    57 When she looked upon the surging crowd that threatened to crush her, she grew pale and faint, and clung, with her olden-time timidity, to the arm of her brother-in-law. "Why, Love, you little coward, what are you trembling for?" "Oh, Neville, I wish I had not allowed you to coax me to come to this hateful place." "Treason, treason, fair lady. Do you have, the audacity to call this edifice a 'hateful place'?" "If that be treason, then am I a traitor," said a laughing voice beside them. f"Ha, Lionel, well met," cried Neville. "You must take pity on me, and assume the charge of this young lady, who has some intention of faint- ing, I fear. Allow me to present you:--.my sister, Miss Richmond, Mr. Percy." "I will be most happy to give the support of my arm to Miss Richmond, if she will aea- it," answered the gallant young midshipman, bowing as gracefully as the circumstances would admit. "Thank you," answered Love, raising her eyes to the face of her new acquaintance, not ill pleased to find it eminently handsome: ' I will accept your escort, as my brother seems quite anxious to be rid of me." "And for no other reason, lady?" "You mistake me," answered Love, smiling, and   58    IMAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. with the faintest possible blush,: I am well pleased with the exchange.",  Neille :shook his head at her; and Lionel Percy made a laughing, grateful acknowledgment.  Ere they had reached the goal of their hopes- the reception-room of their President--4toey felt as if they hadl known, each other for years. They both discovered it was not such a hateful place after all, for they remained more than an hour seated in the East Room, taking no note of how time was flying, until Neville and Grace approached and asked if they were willing to go home.  'tou must dine with us to-day, Lionel, if your engagements will permit," said Neville. "I have no engagement that I cannot break for the pleasure of dining with you. I had promised a half-dozen or so of fellows from our ship t0f:meet them at the Indian Queen; but if they wait lor me their dinner will be cold." "And 'whlat will your friends think of you for treating them so badly?" asked Love. "They would think me worse than mad were I to act otherwise." , "'Are you acquainted with Captain Clinton, Ne- ville?"-inquired Lionel, as they lingered over the dessert.               i Only by reputation." "He is in Washington, and, with your per-   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    59 mission, I will introduce him to you this evening. I am certain you will be pleased with him --he is a noble fellow." Then turning to Love, he said, "He is a widower, Miss Richmond, his wife having died some two years since. The ladies are perfectly wild about him; but he cannot be prevailed on to surrender to their fascinations. I give you fair warning, as a friend, that his heart -i buried : so do not lose yours." "Never fear," answered Love, gayly: "rI hate old widowers."  "[But Captain Clinton is not an old widower: he is only thirty." "He:is far too old for me. Besides, widowers are my pet aversion, and I am determined not to like him," - - "Why do you have such anantipathy toward widovers?; They-poor fellows!-cannot help their misfortunes. And I am sure the greater portion of them always take particular pains to make them- selves agreeable to the ladies." . "That i; just the, reason why I hate them," answered Love. "They take far too much pAins to make themselvess interesting. Here is a case in point :-One evening last week I was at a small party, enjoying a quiet little chat with a dearfriend of i-iiire, Katie Dunnington,.--by4theway, I Will present you to her this evening, but, I warn you in   60    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. return, she is an arrant flirt,-when who should walk in but one of those hateful widowers, and, instead of talking to some of the gentlemen or elderly ladies, he must seat himself beside me, the  youngest girl in the room? and he actually made love to me, though his wife had been dead only three months! It was positively shocking." And there was a slight frown on the white brow, and a pout on the rosy lips, as the wilful little lady con- cluded her speech, Lionel looked on her admiringly, and asked, "But shall I bring Captain Clinton this even- ing?" "Oh, yes, if you wish. But you must promise to protect me from him. I verily believe it is my fate to be martyred by the attention of widowers." "I will pledge myself to place myself as a barri- cade to protect you from widowers in general, and this widower in particular." "And when you are threatened with a similar visitation,-widows,-call upon me, and I will pro- tect you from their wiles as well as I possibly can." "Thank you all the same for your proffered kindness,/but I do not care about being protected from the witches." "Oh, well, if that be the case, I have nothing more to say," observed Love, a little piqued.   ,MAGDALBN THE ENOHANTRESSi.    61 "Nay, nay, now," he returned; "I do not doubt your power to dispel their spells." "I am appeased," she cried. "But what shall I do to repay you for your promised protec- tion?"  "Sing for me to-night."  "With pleasure. But must you go so soon?" "It is nearly five o'clock. I must go, but will report myself on duty at eight.' Good-evening." And, with a sweeping bow, he retired. "Love at-first sight, eh?" cried Neville, as soon as Lionel was beyond hearing. Loved pouted her rosy lips, and retorted, pet- tishy,- "'Tis better love at first sight than no love at all, as is your case, Mr. Neville." It was a random shot; but it told fearfully. N-e- ville's face flushed crimson, and Grace's grew deadly pale. "Oh, Love, sister Love, what have you said?" "What is it, Grace?  What do you mean? What have I said?"Love threw herself on the sofa beside Grace, and hei eyes filled with tears as she looked wonderingly frdm one to the other. "Don't cry, Love," said Neville, as soon as he could collect himself sufficiently: "it is nothing. Your. innocent words recalled  a long-buried memory." 6   62    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "But what is it? .Any one, :to look at your guilty faces, would think you had committed mur- der and Grace was an accomplice." .  "Not quite so bad as that," answered Neville, trying to laugh. "What is it? Tell me, and I will assist in re- interring this memory that I have raised from the grave of the past." "But a secret, after it has passed to a third per- son, is no secret." "I don't care!" persisted Love, with her olden waywardness: "I Will know. You shall-Oh, keep your old ghost of a secret; for here comes Kate. She is not so chary of her secrets, I guess; and, besides, I have one or two to tell her." And the wayward, capricious little gypsy sprang up and skifped away to welcome her friend. A- they stand together, we will say a few words about them. Kate Dunnington was a sweet little creature, overflowing with mischief and loving playfulness. Her light step. and merry song, were herd con- tinually, in parlor or in kitthen, in the chamber or on the staircase, as the graceful figure'flitted hither and thither; She was loved by all, envied by none; yet there was much to envy, for she. was called pretty and sWeet-tempered. Her hair, and eyes were light brown,-not an uncommon color,-   MAQDALtj THE BENOHATIE88.    63 yet in perfect harmony with her clear complxion and petite figure. Loves Richmond was, in person, strangely like Magdalen., She possessed Magdalen's slender, ele- gant figure, and small, beautifully-formed head, the same colorless complexion, long blue-black hair, and tiny foot and hand. The. expression of her mouth and eyes was different. Although Love was forever flying about with a laugh or a jest, her eyes never played their part, butl always wore a shadowy, brooding light. that contrasted singularly with, her smiling, rose bud mouth. Love was a dreamer, and was half ashamed of it: therefore she pretended to laugh at love and romance. But her dreamy, romantic spirit revealed itself in wild, wailing music, she having inherited from .h mother the gift of improvisation. She was a; re friend, but a bitter enemy. She was just .and -, honorable; but, unlike her sister Grace, she was not disposed to forgive an injury or submit with pa- tience to wrong. After the two had chatted a moment, she said,-- "Come to my room, Kate: I want to have you look as pretty as may be to-night, because a widower, who, report says, cannot be conquered, is to be here. He is a captain in the United States Navy, too."' '   "    MAGDALEN THEA ENCHATR TBS-. "Oh, dear me! my heart is gone already, Love. But is he handsome?" "I don't know: I never saw him in my life, and never heard of him till to-day. But, I say, Kate, you mustn't interfere with my handsome midship- man, Lionel Percy." -"Never fear, Love. I prefer to be the captain's lady." "But come; and you, brother Neville and sister Grace, mind to have that secret buried, and no trace remaining, when we return." When the door closed on the girls, Grace knelt beside her husband- and laid her head on his bosom.  4 This has been a forbidden subject between us for two years, and during that time I cannot find a single thing to reproach you with. You have never shown, by the least sign, that you still remember her. But I know all that you suffer, my husband, for she haunts your dreams, and you murmur her name as you have never murmured mine. But do not'think I am reproaching you.' I know how you have struggled against this passion, and God has given me strength to be patient and almost content. You are young yet, dearest,-only twenty-five; and even if I should live five years yet,-which is scarcely possible,-you will have many years of happiness,   MAGDALEN THE ENOHANTIESS.    65 to reward you for your tender care of the unhappy cause of all this misery." "Oh, Grace, my noble wife, your every word and' glance has been a reproach to my guilty soul. But I believe that you have not so intended. It is as you say: I have struggled against this passion.

"COME, captain, you must go. I promised that you would accompany me, and I must keep my word. A single glance of Miss Richmond is worth tthe visit. She is only sixteen or seventeen, I should judge, but the loveliest creature I ever saw." You are aware I am not so great an admirer of feminine loveliness as I once was," answered the captain, with a sigh.; "Well, well, but you will go to oblige me?" said Lionel, a little vexed that his friend had no desire to see the beauty who had so suddenly won his heart. "Certainly I will go to oblige you," answered the captain, smiling at the enthusiasm of the youth. When they were ushered into the parlor, where   MAGDALEN THB ENCHANTRESS.    67 several guests were assembled, Captain Clinton glanced carelessly around, but suddenly started a step toward Kate, exclaiming, with agitation,- My God, Emily!" His emotion was unnoticed by all save Kate, and the ceremony of presentation proceeded. When this form was through with, Captain Clinton seated himself beside Kite and explained the cause of the emnotion he had exhibited. "You are so like a very dear lost friend, Miss Dunnington, that for an instant I felt' as if I stood in her presence." "His wife," thought Kate. "Good!" He remained conversing with her during the evening, and they were mutually pleased and interested.  "Look at your paragon of a widower," whispered Love to Lionel, exultingly. "Instead of joining papa and mamma or Grace, he must devote himself to Katie." "I must confess that it is a little singular,- indeed, very singular," said Lionel, as he observed them particularly for the first time diring the evening. At this moment Captain Clinton rose, and, offer- ing his arm. to Kate, led. her toward them. The puzzled expression on Lionel's face changed to one of astonishment, and he exclaimed,-   68    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "Heavens! what a resemblance!" "What is it?" asked Love. "Are you bewitched too?" she added, pettishy, ashe did hot reply. "Pardon me, but she is a perfect counterpart of his wife, Emily,Clinton." "Miss Richmond," said the captain, who had approached sufficiently near to address her, "Miss Dunnington will not sing for me, but has promised to prevail on you to give us some music, in which accomplishment, she assures me, you excel." "Miss Richmond promised me a song this even- ing provided I protected her from a threatened danger. Am I deserving of the reward?" "Firly," answered Love, as, seating herself at the piano and running her fingers over the keys, she drew forth a sweet, wild strain of music. "Give me a theme." "I am not particular as to the song. Select one yourself." "You mistake, Lionel. Miss Richmond is an improvvisatrice," explained Captain Clinton. "An improvvisatrice? Is it possible? Give you a theme? I imagine I will. Love." "That has been his theme for some hours past, Miss Love," said Captain Clinton, mischievously addressing her by her baptismal name. J l Kate laughed, and Love swept the keys to cover   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.          69- her embarrassment, and then her clear, sweet voice filled the room with melody :- "Oh, tell me what is love, mbther," Said a maiden fair and young: "Love is a witching dream, daughter, Over life's pathway flung." "But tell me of this dream, mother Is it hot fair and bright?" "'Tis sometimes very fair, daughter, But oftener a blight."  "Our neighbor, Charlie ILe, mother, Says that he loveth me: It makes me smile and blush, mother;         . And then, too, blusheth he."  In seeming this is love, daughter; This is the starry dream That over thy young life, daughter, Mayhap will briefly gleam." "Ah, yes, for he may die, mother,- My love, my Charlie Lee; Or I, should I go first, mother, Hie soon would follow me."

"We have generally found them so: have we not, eKatie?"  "Do not call on me to endorse your outrageous slanders against the 'lords of creation,"' answered Kate, laughingly. "I am a firm believer in their truth and constancy, and devoutly pray that I may never have cause to change," "We are honored by your faith in us, Miss Dun- nington, and deeply grateful for your championship i Sii r cause," said Lionel, "but grieved beyond measure that Miss Richmond's experience in love has been such as to impel her to condemn us all." Love was piqued that he should imply that she had been jilted, and answered, with a- pout that looked very pretty on her,-- "I have had no experience as yet: I judge from my observation of the love-affairs of others." "But," persisted Lionel, "you told me to-day that you had just returned from the impenetrable walls of a boarding-school." "Fairly caught, Miss Love," cried Kate, gleefully; "so just confess your real sentiments, and ten to one but you are a firmer believer in the devoted love and unfaltering faith of mankind than your frank-spoken friend Kate Dunnington."   MAGDALEN TIm BrNCBArTRISS.    71 Could those impenetrable walls" have been en- dowed&with the sense of speech, how many a love- passage they could have recounted! How many frightened girls had thrust their little trembling hands through the bars of'the gate, to be pressed to the laughing lips of some audacious youth! How many love-messages had been transmitted by myste- rious little notes, or through the agency of flowers, by the more timid or romantic! The walls could not speak, Love would not, and it would be a breach of trust in us to do so. - But to return to Love: she did not feel much pleased that they should think her the romantic little creature she really was; so she answered, with sturdy stubbornness,- "I won't confess that which I don't believe, Kate Diwnnington to the contrary notwithstanding." "You will at least except present company, Miss Richmond?" "Not even present company,. Mr. Percy; until I am well assured that present company forms an exception to the general rule." "But it is the ladies who are proverbially fickle." "They may be so," she answered, quietly. "Do you think they are called so unjustly?" "I don't know." "But you do." "If I have been shut up in a boarding-school, 1 ave had no greater facilities for observing the   72 -   MAGDALEN THE NCHANTRESS. ladies' constancy in love than that of the gentle- men," returned the wily diplomatist, who had been eagerly watching an opportunity for retorting on her opponents. "You are non-committal, I see. But can I, by either argument or action, convince you that your opinion concerning us is unjust?" "I think not, Mr. Percy." "If that is the case, I am silent," "Never give up the ship, Percy," cried Captain Clinton. "Miss Richmond is too just and generous not to acknowledge an error when she is assured that it is an error; and I am certain that you can convince her that this is one." "I will at some future time make the attempt, captain. And now, Miss Richmond, will you favor us with another song?" "' With pleasure." She sang song after song, at the earnest request of her companions; and when Lionel bade the young improvvisatrice good-night he was more charmed than ever.

"NEWS, Grace!" cried Love,as she entered the parlor where her sister sat sewing. She was accom- panied by Lionel, who had been for nearly three months her almost constant attendant. "Well, I am   dying to hear it, as you young ladies say," said Grace, smilingly. "Mrs. Shelby is dead, and Magdalen will be in Washington this week." "Are you ill, Mrs. Heath?" cried Lionel, in alarm, as her face grew pale. "I have not been well for two years past, Mr. Percy, and have been feeling even worse than usual this morning." He brought her a glass of water, and the color soon returned to her cheeks. 7   (4    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "Miss Love has been telling me, Mrs. Heath, that this same mourning Magdalen charms each and all who look upon her. Is she really so fascinating?" "She can win lover from mistress and husband from wife, if she willeth," answered Grace, with an affectation of that gayety she had worn as a mask for so long a time. She must be akin to the witches if she can wield such power." "She is an elfish-looking creature, and, from the number of her suitors, is known as 'Magdalen the Enchantress.' But, jesting aside, she is the most fascinating woman I ever saw. She possesses, in addition to unequalled beauty, a finely-cultivated mind and all the accomplishments that adorn womanhood." "But her heart, Mrs. Heath? Has her heart been cultivated to as high a degree of perfection as her intellect?" "Ah, I cannot give so favorable a report in re- gard to her heart: it is said to be unsusceptible of cultivation. She has won many hearts, but hers is still unwon." "Too bad! too bad!" "I sympathize with you in your distress, but am surprised at your disappointment. All the coquettes I have ever known have been utterly devoid of all those beautiful attributes of the inner life which   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.     75 give a certain nameless attraction to even a homely woman if she be pure-hearted." "I haye known exceptions to the rule," said Lionel, with a sly glance at Love. "There may be exceptions, but they are certainly very rare."  "I admit thatCthey are so, and do not wish you:to consider ne a defender of that mischievous class of society. But to return to the 'Enchantress:' I am all curiosity to behold this singular creature." 'Be guarded.; for she wins and breaks hearts with the graceful indifference of an adept in the murderous science." Grace saw that her sister was learning to love Lionel with all the strength of her romantic nature, and trembled lest Magdalen should select him for a victim. ",She shall never win mine, much less break it," said Lionel, defiantly. "Be not too well assured, fair sir. She has never failed to bewitch any one yet, sooner or later. But you must excuse me for a time. I have lingered chatting with you to the utter neglect of my mani- fold household duties."  "Miss Love," whispered Lionel, eagerly, as Grace turned from them, "if I resist the spells of the 'Enchantress,' will you let that be the test of my unfaltering love for you?" "Yes," she answered; and she looked- a little   76    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. troubled when she remembered that the all-powerful Magdalen was likely to be her rival. ," And will you promise me your hand and heart if I remain true to you?" "By no means," she answered, coolly. "It mat- ters little to me whether you love her or not." "Really?" "Really." He sighed, and dropped his head upon the table despondingly. Love smilingly laid her hand upon his dark hair, and said, softly,- "Lionel!" He did not raise his head.. "Lionel, I love you a little." He looked up hopefully. "Dear Love!" "Indeed, I love you a great deal, as a friend." "Hang your friendship'!"He started up and walked rapidly through the room. "Lionel!" He had paused at the window, and would not hear her. She smiled again, and glided to his side. "Lionel, I did not finish: I love you as a friend, and it may be that I will love you far better if you wish me." He-turned quickly.   MAG)ALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    " "Here have I been saying to you, a hundred times a day, 'Will you love me?' and you assure me as many times that you (won't;' that is the word,-' won't;' and now you come, with all the pretty artlessness imaginable, and say, 'Lionel, I love you as a friend, and it may be that I will love you far better if you wishi me.' You are enough to drive any sensible man distracted!" "Am I? Then you are in no danger," she said, demurely. "You are always saying," he went on, without heeding the interruption, " that atie is a flirt, or Agatha's a flirt; but you are the greatest flirt of them all!" "Don't get so excited, please, Lionel. Why do you allow yourself to be flirted with, if you know it?" "Simply because I am a -confounded fool, and can't help it." "Your reasons are good, and entirely satisfac- tory." "I believe you think I really am a fool!" ' I cannot question your veracity; and--you-do act------" "A little foolishy at times?" with and laughed at by your lady-love!" 7*   78    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS   . "I have neither flirted nor laughed at you, Lionel, and if I don't love you I don't lote any one else: that is some consolation," "Consolation with a vengeance! Here am I to be placed upon an equal footing with Will Calvert and Jack O'Niel, or any--" "And if you are!" interrupted Love. "They are noble, brave, and generous. Where is the in- equality?" "There is none in your estimation, I clearly per- ceive. I have the honor to bid you a very good- morning; and if you see me within a week your eyes will flash with pleasure, Lady Love." He caught up his cap and hastily left the room. "I wish I could tell him how dearly I love him," murmured his tormentor; but the only way that I can preserve my treasure from that ogre Magdalen is to pretend that I do not value it. He will come this evening in penitence, and, as usual, I shall tease him, and he'll leave in -a pet. How can he be so blind as to doubt that I love him? Dear Lionel!" She had been watching his retreating figure from the window, andd as he disappeared she turned away with a half-sigh, and murmured, dreamily, "Will he ever change'? N o, no. What says the sweet song he sang but yesternight? Ah, I re- member:-   MAODALEN THE ENCHANTRBES.     79 ' The4eartthat has truly loved never forgets, But as truly loves on to the close; As the sunflower turns-- * ' She ceased as her ear caught the sound of sup- pressed laughter, and, turning her eyes in the direc. tion whence it proceeded, they rested on the mis- chievous face of Kate Dunnington. "So you are in love, and, as a matter of course, in trouble? I saw your lover rushing round corners at a mad pace a moment since, and knew that there had certainly been another quarrel. What is the trouble?" "Why, he asled me if I loved him, and went away in a pet because I wouldn't say yes." "But you do love him, and you may lose him by your trifling. Hearts are easily won and easily lost, Love. Beecareful." "Never fear, Kate. If his heart is lost to me, mine will not break," answered Love, proudly. "I am not certain," said Kate, shaking her head. "I think if Captain Clinton should flirt with me that mine would break; and yours, if I judge rightly, is scarcely less sensitive." "Has it gone so far? Are you really engaged?" queried Love, with eager interest. "Yes; we are really engaged. And yet I can scarcely believe that he is serious in his professions of love,-I am so unworthy, so far beneath him."   80    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "Beware of Magdalen." I do not fear her," said Kate, with a light laugh; "Captain Clinton is not fickle, and I toss back your warning: you may have need of it: beware of Mag- dalen." "And I answer, in your words, I do not fear her: Lionel is not fickle." "But, seriously, Love, you may drive him to her feet by your caprices. Why not confess that you love him?" "Because if I should do such a rash thing I might be left to wear the willow. You do not understand the human heart so well as I, Kate. So long as he is in doubt as to my feelings toward him, there is no danger of his deserting me even for Magdalen." "Time will determine whose system is best." "I shall triumph." "I think we should be enrolled in the diplomatic corps," cried Kate, laughing in Love's grave face. "But sit down, Love: I must tell you all about this love-affair of mine, as you are to be my first bride- maiden."    MAGDALEB- THE EmBI  TREAgS.  .  81 CHAPTER XII. "She has all That would insure an angel's fall; But there's a cool, collected look, As if her pulses beat by book,- A measured tone, a cold reply, A management of voice and eye, A calm, possess'd, authentic air, That leaves a doubt of softness there."   THE evening after Magdalen's 'arrival she was called upon by Mr. and Mrs. Heath, Love, Kate, Captain Clinton, and Lionel. She looked unusually beautiful in her rich mourning-robes, and Captain Clinton was much impressed by the simple elegance displayed in both her dress and manner. Not so Lionel. He whispered to Love,- "I am disappointed in the 'Enchantress.' She is very much like you, only not half so lovely." "Wait! Her beauty is her least charm. She does not owe her sobriquet of 'Enchantress' to it, Although she is certainly very lovely,-a great deal handsomer than I am."  Merely a difference of opinion! But I believe Clinton is being bewitched already. What beautiful eyes she has!"  82    MAGDALEK THE ENCHANTRESS. "I believe you are being bewitched as well," said Love, who did not relish the tone in which her lover's last exclamation had been made. ^ "Do not fear: 'forewarned, forearmedl' I owe my safety to you." It was curious to note the changing expression of Magdalen's eyes as she greeted her guests. They wore a tender, pleading look when she welcomed Grace, and seemed to say, 'Forgive and pity me.' They flashed an affectionate glance to Love and Kate, but changed to the expression of hopeless love which he so well remembered when she placed her hand in Neville's. She acknowledged the presenta- tion of Captain Clinton and Lionel with a careless grace peculiarly her own, and then addressed her- self to Grace.     . "You are looking more delicate than when I parted from you, Mrs. Heath. Do you enjoy good health?" Grace started at the question, but, instantly com- posing herself, answered, quietly,-- "My health is not very good, Magdalen. I shall not live many years, I think." All eyes were turned on Grace. Love noticed for the first time that her much-loved sister was looking paler and more fragile. The silence grew not only embarrassing,- but oppressive to Magdalen, Grace, and Neville. The latter forced himself to say,- ?.?- ^"' * ^   MAGDAtLEN TH ENCRHANTRSBS.   88 "Nonsense, Grace! You are getting nervous. I never knew you to be low-spirited until within the past week." Magdalen hastened to change the topic of con- versation, and all soon felt at their/#se. When they left, Love, Kate, and Lionel professed themselves bound to the chariot-wheels of the "Enchantress." Captain Clinton walked beside Kate in silence, and, when she asked his opinion of Magdalen, simply answered,-- I have seldom seen women so beautiful as she,-- never one more beautiful" Magdalen, being in mourning, mingled very little in gay society; but her handsome drawing-room was always filled with the rank and beauty of the city. She exerted herself to please Love and Kate, and suc- ceeded in entirely gaining their hearts. She soon dis- covered that the last-named was the betrothed bride of the handsome naval officer, and the desire to add him to her list ofAuitors took instant possession of her scheming brain. When she heard that he was wealthy, she determined to marry him; for be it known that, although her fortune had been ample, she had dissipated the greater part of it while in Italy. She still held Neville in her cruel chains,'and he forgot all his resolutions to overcome his love for her when in her presence. He had repeatedly   84    4MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. assured her, since her return, that his heart was still hers;-and his really noble and virtuous principles had been so perverted by this artful woman that he once said to her,-  "You were  at, Magdalen: Grace will not live many years, anin you will be mine.' She had been I ing for an hour with clasped hands and upraised eyes to his love's low tones; but now she drew away as in horror, and answered,- Never!" I do not understand you!". "Understand, then, that I despise you for daring to insult me by asking my hand while yet bound by marriage-vows to another, and, further, that I will soon have the honor of being congratulated as a bride." "Magdalen, you are jesting." "I fear that it will prove a bitter jest toyou," she answered, with a laugh.  "If you speak truly, Magdalon, why did you not leave me -to- be -happy .in -the delusion of loving Grace? Why have you made my. life and hers wretched?".  "Revenge is. sweet, she answeredj as she toyed carelessly with the rings that encircled her white fingers.  "Revenge! For what?" he asked, in astonish- Be   MAGDALEN TB ENCBHANTRESS.    85 ment, wondering the while if she was not mad or he in a dream. "I loved you once, Neville Heath, and you loved, or feigned to love, me. That w  hen we were almost children. Through some ice, you neg- lected ihe and turned to Gra mond. I was almost broken-hearted when  arried her. Since your marriage I have hated the whole human race. It was a long, long time ere I succeeded in- banish- ing all love for you from my heart; but I have at last succeeds: I do not love you." "You do not love me?" "I do not love you. Allow me to conclude this pleasant conference by bidding you a very good morning."  She made a low, stately curtsey and glided away. From this time he was utterly changed. To Grace he was no longer kindeand affectionate, but harsh and cruel. To all others he was gloomy and irri- table. This came as a heavy blow to Grace, al- though she had long felt assured that it would come sooner or later. "Her propheticwords are ever sounding in my ear:-' You will live a most wretched life for a few years; and then you will die by poison administered by the hand of your husband!' This is more than I can bear. What great sin is on my soul, that I 8  86    MAGDALEN TWE ENCHANTRESS.  must be so terribly punished.? Oh, would I could die and be at rest!"Thus she would moan in the stillness of her own chamber. Love noticed Ne- ville's gloomy  and Grace's tears, and wondered what could b   quarrel.

Pardon me: I cannot forbear my disagree- able habit, you see." She was white and trembling. "How did you learn this? Are you in league with the devil?" "Certainly not. I have many Ways of acquiring knowledge, without that questionable assistance. I am delighted with this sudden change in your views, I must confess. It is far better to marry Captain Clinton than to persist in your mad scheme of murdering Grace and marrying her husband." "You know that I never had the least intention of murdering Grace. It is your own vile heart that causes you to suspect me of contemplating such a horrible crime." "Well, well, I am aware, at least, that it must be an unpleasant subject; and we will not continue it.- 8   90    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. How are you to proceed in order to capture tliis fortune?" I may use him," she thought,-then said, aloud, "Are you acquainted with him?" "Yes." "Then you can assist me materially, if you will. In the course of conversation you can manage to make him aware of the fact that I am a recent con- vert to Catholicism." "So you are compelled to ask my assistance at the first step," he said, regarding her admiringly. "I think that we could not exist one without the other. I wish that you were possessed of wealth, and I would enter the lists as a suitor for your hand, and win it, proud lady," he added, as her eyes sparkled with anger. "You are a fool." '; It is fortunate that you are poor, or I might be. What else can I do for you after conveying, by direct means or otherwise, the important informa- tion that you are a Catholic?" "I require nothing further of you." The conversation terminated, and he bowed carelessly and sauntered from the room. As the door closed, he smothered the laugh that rose to his lips, and muttered,- "She is the fool." A day or two after this interview, Calvert and   MAODALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    91 Clinton called, with Love and Kate, for the purpose of spending an evening with Magdalen. "Captain Clinton," said Calvert, in a pause of the conversation, "I have heard that you are a Catholic." "You have been rightly informed, sir: my an- cestors were Catholics, and I am proud to be able to say that not one of them changed their religion, although several died martyrs in its cause." "I am very glad to know, sir, that you are a Catholic," murmured the sweet, low -voice of Mag- dalen. "I, too, am a member of the Catholic Church." "Ah?" he exclaimed, in a tone of pleased sur- prise. "I was under the impression," he continued, smiling and bowing to Love' and Kate, "that all my lady friends were heretics.'" "I became interested in Catholicism some years since, visited Italy for the purpose of investigating it, and soon became a convert." "Have you ever visited a convent, Miss Shelby?" "Oh, yes," she answered, smiling: "I thought very seriously, at one time, of becoming a perma- nent inmate, but, discovered, as we Catholics say, that I had mistaken my vocation." "Is it possible? But do you not think it a peaceful and happy life that these good women live "  /    92    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS "I do indeed. And have you ever observed how youthful they seem? There was one little nun to whom I took quite a fancy,-Sister Dolores,-who was apparently twenty-five. One day I asked her, laughingly, if she were an old maid, and was in- formed, greatly to my astonishment, that she was old enough to be my mother. She had been placed in the convent as a pupil when a little child of three years. At fifteen she had completed her education and entered society. Two years after, at the age of seventeen, she joined the sisterhood, and for thirty- five years had not stepped beyond the convent- walls. I was incredulous, To convince me, she threw off her veil, and her closely-cut hair was ;almost entirely gray. I asked her why it was that the nuns looked so much younger than persons of the same age who were of the world. 'Ah, my child,' she answered, half seriously, half jestingly, 'we are free from the wearing cares and passions of the world; or rather, instead of fretting for a ribbon or weeping for a ring, we save our tears to obliterate the stains of sin from our souls. 'Your tears cause you to grow old and ugly, while ours have a con- trary effect, and year by year we grow fairer and more youthful, until we become like the children He loveth so much.' As I looked upon her calm face, I felt the full force of her remarks, and wished that I too was a nun."   XAGDALEN THE ENOHANTRES.    98 "It strikes me forcibly," said te, "that this fair bride of heaven was just the least bit vain," Love perceived that her friend was treading on dangerous ground, and inquired, somewhat has- tily,--. "What did you say her name was, Magdalen?" "Sister Dolores." "An appropriate name for a grumpy, dolorous old nun," laughed Kate. This was the first time that Kate had made the slightest attempt to ridicule her lover's religion or any thing connected with it; and her words grated harshy upon his ear. Magdalen noted the effect of poor Kate's careless remark, and hastened to make capital of it by saying, reproachfully,- "They are neither dolorous nor grumpy, Kate, but the kindest and merriest creatures in exist. ence."' "Pardon me, both. If I have wounded you, it was through thoughtlessness," said Kate, gently. "I would not for the world speak lightly of the religion of any one." "I pardon you, said Magdalen. "And you?"Kate raised her eyes to Captain Alinton's, and their glance said, as plainly as words gould have spoken, ," It is an idle question." He answered, politely yet coldly,-    i "I forgive, but cannot forget."   "    MAGDALE 'THB EENOBANTRSS. She veiled the eyes that were fast fillitng with tears, and her heart grew heavyfdor -what she scarcely knew. There was an :awkward silence, which was broken by Love:- "Is it true, Captain Clinton, that there are Catholics who are opposedto the cloister Huns? I have heard that such is the case."* There are many Catholics in the United States, I believe, who disapprove of a woman shutting her- self up in a nunnery; but none object to the order of Sisters of Charity, where the vows are renewed every year." 4But do you approve of a woman entering a cloister?" "I freely confess, Miss Richmond, that the idea was a little repulsive to me at one -time; but my prejudice was removed by a nun to whom I had remarked that it seemed like being buried alive to be surrounded by convent walls, and asked her why she did not become a Sister of Charity. She smiled and answered, 'I, like many .women, would have become one of that noble sisteihood, but .lacked their humility and saintly strength of character. I shrunk from entering hospitals, in times of war or pestilence, for the; purpose of nursing men; and: I therefore entered a cloister. Some women are so constituted that they cannot do it, and I am one. ,'\   AUWALJJ THE ENCHANTRESS.     96 Are you satisfied?' I expressed myself fully satis- fied, and hope that you will do the same." "I am too much of a Protestant,-or heretic, if you will. I merely wished to have your opinion on the subject." "I think I will try to convert you," he said. "It will be a waste of time to try. I am not easily influenced. I think you might succeed better with Kate." Hie colored slightly to think he had been so neglectful, so forgetful of her, and crossed hastily to where she was sitting and bent over her. H "Forgive me, Kate," he whispered, "but your careless words wounded me deeply." "I am very sorry: forgive me." The cloud that had overshadowed her heart was lifted by those few words of his, and she soon laughed as lightly as ever. Magdalen was, after that night, a regular attend- ant at mass and vespers, and Captain Clinton was frequently her escort. As a matter of course, he 3oon fell deeply in love with the beautiful convert, and regretted the engagement he had made so iastily with Kate. If there was any change in his manner toward his )etrothed, Kate was too happy, in the full assurance  of his love, to perceive it. "7   96     MAGLDALEN THE ENECHANTRESS. CHAPTER XIV.

MAGDALEN had been in her own country about three months, when a gentleman of wealth and poBition issued cards for a masquerade. As it was generally understood that it would be a grand affair, all the young people were in a flutter of excitement. Only five days of preparation remained, and Love was still undecided in the choice of the celebrity she would personate. "Please assist me in a selection, Kate. It seems so vain and conceited to appear as Mary of Scot land, Anna Boleyn, or any of the Sourbeauties of the olden time; and I don't like the idea of dis figuring myself as a witch or soceress. Whosal I be? that's the question" " "What is the excitement, Love?" inquired Mag- dalen, who had entered with Agnes O'Niel. "How are you, girls? I am delighted to see you. There is this masque almost here, and I don't know what I'm to be."   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTREl$8.   97 "Take your guitar and go as a gypsy." She whirled round and confronted the speaker, who was none other than Lionel, and made a face at him as he stood in the doorway. "Keep your advice until it is called for, sir." ',I gave it in all kindness, I am sure. You have been in such a fidget for a week past that  your friends are seriously alarmed lest you go crazy." "When I am in need of your advice I will ask it. Well, Aggie, what say you?"  "I have no advice to offer on this momenta,-3 subject," answered Agnes, with her rare and radin: i smile. "I will depend on my own fancy, then. Magdalen, you must go-as a Spanish donna." "I shall not go at all, Love: I am still in motim- ing."  , "It is now nearly a year, Magdalen, since your bereavement; and if you are in mourning you can wear the black robe and mantle of the noble Spanish lady with perfect propriety. Please consent to be present." "I will think about it, Love." The night appointed for the masquerade at length arrived, and the guests began to assemble, at an earlier hour than usual, at the mansion of their entertainer. G       9   98    LMAGDALEN THEie ENANTRESS. Kate looked bewitching as , Constance," and Cap. tain Clinton accompanied her as Wildrake." The captain seemed ill at ease in his finery, and was half ashamed of what seemedd to him such foolery. Lionel looked "Charles the Second of Spain" to perfection. Love had acted on his laughing sug- gestion, and wore the gay petticoat and jacket of a gypsy maiden. Henry Calvert's brilliant court-dress contrasted strikingly with Magdalen's rich black robes, as did that of Clarence with Agnes's demure Quaker attire. Many of the disguises were so complete that some queer incidents occurred, and numerous mistakes were made during the evening. When the evening was half spent, Captain Clin. ton, who no longer experienced pleasure in being near Kate, wandered into the conservatory, seated himself in a quiet nook, and was soon buried in his own wild and troubled dreams.  Magdalen had gained such ii ascendancy over his imagination-we cannot write heagrt-that she could draw him to her side with a glance and repel him with a motion of her hand,. 'e was completely captive to her- magic influence. Yet he was too high-souled to break with his betrothed without the shadow of a cause; and he knew that she had given him none. So absorbed was he in reverie that he   MAGOQIEN' THE ENCHANTRESS.   99 was not aaware a lady and gentleman had entered the conservatory and seated themselves near him, until his heart thrilled to the lute-toned voice of Magdalen. He started, and leaned eagerly toward them, that he might not lose a sound that issued from her Hlipte 'But does he love Kate Dunnington?" inquired her companion, who was none other than Henry Calvert, in response to something she had said. "He must love her, or he would not hesitate in breaking- the engagement existing between them. He would have me think he loves me; but how can I, when the day is fast approaching that will make her his bride and me sad-hearted?" He forgot every thing when the sad music of her loved tones were sounding in his ear, andnmade a silent vow that he would-hesitate no longer, but ask her to be his wife that very evening, "Have you so little pride, Magdalen, as to be won unsought?" "I have not been won unsought. He would have me believe that 'his love is mine only; and, alas; I believe him when he is with me, and weep when he is gone." "If it is as you say, it may be that you wrong Clinton by doubting his love for you. His ideas of honor- are peculiar; and it is probable that he thinks it dishonorable to ask a release from Kate,   100    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. while I think it not only dishonorable but base to wed her while he not only does not love her but is actually in love with you," "Hush, Henry: he will be the victim, not Kate." "What do you mean?" "Simply what I say. Every one knows that it has been Kate's boast that she is a coquette; and it grieves and angers me when I hear him laughed at as being a blind fool not to see that she would never dream of marrying him were it not for his wealth." "Why do you not hint as much to him?" "Because it would seem like a lack of delicacy in me, and I would rather never see his face than lose his respect and esteem." He heard no more, for they arose and passed into the ball-room. "Ha! ha!" laughed Calvert, as soon as they were beyond hearing, "I think this last little ruse has won the field. I congratulate you on your success in defeating your rival; and further, as my part is played, I will make my exit, and will iMflict my dis- agreeable presence on you no more until I greet you as Mrs. Clinton. Then I shall claim my re- ward."  "Ha!" ejaculated Magdalen; and a gleam of light flashed through her mind for the firsttime. "You seem astonished; and, for once in your de-   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   101 ceptive life, you seem what you really are. Did'you think for an instant that a man would degrade him- self by being a party to such detestable plots as those wherein I have aided you, without some inte- rested motive? You are completely in my power now. I have made this match, and I can break it." "You cannot. I defy you to attempt it. His heart is mine; and Kate Dunnington is said to be a flirt; and last, though not least, she is poor, while I am thought to be a wealthy heiress. We have given him the impression that she is scheming for his wealth, and he will not hesitate to break the engagement. You are wont to be more cautious : I wonder you did not make your bargain ore you performed the labor. Her want of wealth was the card upon which I relied."- "And it has failed you. She is far wealthier than either or both of you." "You are speaking falsely." "I am speaking truly. Will you give me five thousand dollars, 6r. shall I expose you? Kate Dun- nington may have been a flirt; but that she loves Clinton deeply I am convinced, and doubt not that she would give me twice the sum I ask of you to preserve him from you." "ool! You know that she would blastydu with a glance, were it possible, if you daredito propose such a thing to her."  9*   102    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "True. All ladies are not----" "I know what you would say," she interrupted, angrily; " and, to be rid of your hated presence, I agree to your terms." "And they are moderate. Here I give you a wealthy and handsome husband. There is another consideration, too, which is by no means a slight one in your eyes, if I judge rightly. The perils of the sea are many, and it may be that in a few years you will be left free, as a dashing young widow, to prosecute your old plot." "What now?" she asked, impatiently. "You may deceive Neville Heath by telling him that you do not love him; {,but you cannot deceive me. You know that you look forward to the time when you will be his wife." "Will you sing for me, Miss Shelby?" She started fearfully, for she recognised the voice of Captain Clinton. Turning, she perceived that he had unmasked. "I will sing with pleasure, if it will prove a gratification to you."  Calvert bowed, turned away, and Captain Clinton conducted Magdalen to"the'irusic-room. "Shall I sing one of L6ve's compositions?" He had proposed singing for thi pUrose of see- ing her alone, and, caring little What she sang, answered,-   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.         103 "As you please." She possessed a fine voice, which had been care- fully cultivated, and she threw her whole soul into' the song :- Oh, say, dost thou remember, love, Those happy times of old, When you and I were one in heart, And never proud and cold? Ah, thou dost not remember, love, Those wildly-witching hours When we, as blushing lovers, Hal, Gather'd Love's sweetest flowers  The bridal bells are rining, love, But I am not the bride; Thou art kneeling at the altar With a dearer by thy side. And, now that thou art wedded, love, I e'en must hide the tears That must lie heavy on my heart Through many coming years. My heart is sadly crush'd, sweet love; 'The future's drear and cold; And yet Ilglory that thy heart Was mine in days of old. She sang the concluding stanza in tones thrill- ingly triumphant;, but when she turned her face to her lover bright tears were     glittering in her eyes. "It will be my fate to deeply feel that little song when I sing it again," she said, trying to smile; but   104    MAGDALEN TH E NCRANTRESS. the smile was, as she wished it, heart-breaking in its sadness. "( Never, Magdalen, if I can prevent it, shall you feel that the light of your life has faded. You have known, for some time past, that I loved you, and also of my perplexing engagement to another. Had she been the guileless, childlike creature I deemed her, I would have made her my wife and kept her forever in ignorance of the fact that I did not love her. I now know her to be false and mer- cenary, and I am free to ask your hand: will you give it to me, Magdalen?" Her eyes flashed a glance of glad surprise into his, and she answered,-  "I love you." "Wear this," he -said, placing a ring, set with a single diamond of exceeding brilliancy, on the third finger of her left hand, "until I guard it with the plain gold ring that will bind our hearts forever." As he bowed his head to kiss her hand, she smiled in bitter scorn; but she changed the expres- sion of the smile when he raised it. Kate entered a moment after, utterly unconscious of the game that had been played. She approached them, and laid her hand upon Captain Clinton's arm with a childish tenderness peculiar to her, and cried, laughingly,- 4   MAGiDAIBN THN E NOHANTRIES.   105 "Sweet ladye of wile and witchery, I pray thee, weave no-spells around this heart; for know ye that I yield it not, even to 'Magdalen the En- chantress.'

"t When the cold breath of sorrow is sweeping O'er the chords of the youthful heart, And the earnest eye, dimm'd with strange weeping, Sees the visions of fancy depart; When the bloom of young feeling is dying, And the heart throbs with passion's fierce strife, When oui sad days are wasted in sighing, Who then can find sweetness in life ." HALF buried in the yielding cushions of a l&rge arm-chair drawn near a brilliant coal fire, Kate Dunnington reclined, her little head filled with a hundred girlish dreams,-which, judging from the drooping lashes, softly-flushed cheeks, and smiling mouth, were any thing but unpleasant.     She re- mained perfectly motionless until a hand was laid on her head, and a dear voice cried, cheerily-- "Lights and slippers, my dear." "You here already, papa?" The graceful little figure sprang from the chair, and her father was speedily ensconced therein. She drew a low chair to his side, and was about to throw herself upon it, when she was arrested by her father:-   MAGDALEN THE- ENCHANTRESS.   107 Lights, puss." "Oh, not yet, please, papa." "Just as you say, my love. But I thought you would want to read your letter---" He was silenced by a slight blow saucily adminis- tered by the white hand of Catherine. The next instant a soft light diffused itself through the room, and Kate seated herself by the table and broke the seal with trembling eagerness, for she recognised the chirography as that of Captain Clinton. We transcribe the contents K "Mss CATHERINE bDrNNiG6  :-Ithas always seemed somewhat inexplicable to me that a fair young girl like you should give her youth, beauty, and love to a man twelve, years her senior; yet when I gazed into your innocent eyes I could not doubt your sincerity. How have I been deceived! Last night I was convinced, beyond a doubt, that my only attractions in your eyes were my wealth and rank. It has been intimated to me that you would be-glad to have the opportunity to prosecute me for a breach of promise of marriage, by such means escape a hated marriage, and at the same time receive pecuniary advantages at the slight sacrifice of maidenly modesty and delicacy. To spare you and myself any such unpleasant notoriety, I place at your disposal one-fourth of my fortune,-.   108    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. twenty-five thousand dollars,-hoping you will be satisfied. "In conclusion, I have the honor and pleasure to state that a month hence I shall wed a lovely and true-hearted woman, with whom my fortune can be no temptation, as hers far exceeds mine. The lady to whom I refer is Miss Magdalen Shelby. "Yours, &e., CHAaRLES CLINON." Kate's face grew pale as she perused this cruel and insulting letter; but, with an exertion of will, she had strength to read it to the close, then noise- lessly leave the room. When she reached her own chamber she locked the door and threw herself on the bed, exclaiming,-- "He is in the toils of the siren! I never believed what they said of you, Magdalen; I could not; but now you have won him from me, and my heart will break. Who could have told him that I would seek redress for a broken troth in a court of law? Surely not Magdalen. I could convince him by a few words that his wealth was no object with me; but shall I give utterance to those words' Never! never!" She folded her hands over her eyes in silent thought for a little while, and then arose, and, seat- ing herself at her writing-desk, replied to his letter.   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   109 CAPTAIN CLINTON :-Your very nature must be transformed by the charms of the 'Enchantress,' or you would never have written the insulting epistle I have but just read. You do me great injustice when you accuse me of feigning love for the sake of your gold. I never knew, until to-night, that you were richer than myself; I never thought whether, you were possessed of wealth or not. I believed you noble and honorable, and so gave you my heart, knowing that my love for you made me worthy to be your wife. "Yours, &c., "CATHERINE DUNNINGTON. "P S.-You know that the pith of a lady's letter is always contained in the postscript:- I forgot to release you from your engagement with me, and, to congratulate you on your new arrangements. Allow me to do both           KATE." "That will do)" she murmured, as she sealed and addressed it. "I must deceive him and the gossip- ing world." She smoothed her disarranged dress and joined her father in the parlor. He was too much occu- pied with his own thoughts to observe the traces of suffering still remaining on his daughter's face, and Ahe could not trust herself just then to tell him her trouble. 10    "O    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. After tea she gave the letter she had written to a servant, and said,-  "Take this note to Captain Clinton, George, and place it in his own hands. There is, no answer." "Oh, Missy Katie say, 'No answer, George.' Marse Cap'in say, 'Wait, boy,'-purty old boy, Missy Katie, but not de old boy,-' this requires an answer.'

Kate smiled faintly when the servant concluded, and said,- "I thank you for your appreciation of Captain Clinton and myself; but you must not wait for an answer to-night.-'  "Nlot if Marse Cap'in say wait?" "Not even if the captain should say to wait." "Berry well: just as you say, Missy Katie," said the man, with a downcast, disappointed look. "I 'spects you's had a quarrel?" "Not exactly a quarrel, George." "I 'spects you has, Missy Katie," persisted George, with a troubled look. "Do not wait longer, George. I am anxious for Captain Clinton to receive the letter. Go." She re-entered the parlor and seated herself be- side her father.  "Papa." "Well, my ehild?" "The engagement between Captain Clinton and myself has been broken." "Impossible! For what reason?" "Some one told him that it was his wealth and rank that charmed me, and not himself. And so he wrote me a cruel, cruel letter, charging me with deceit and insincerity, and-and, further, insulted me   "2    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. by saying that he placed one-fourth of the wealth I coveted at my disposal, as he feared being prose. cuted for breach of promise of marriage. Oh, fathe!" She had spoken calmly at first; but her voice fal- tered as she went on, and when she had spoken the last words she dropped hel, head upon her father's knee and wept convulsively. iMr. Dunnington started to his feet, exclaiming,- 'The base, cowardly scoundrel! What a deep satisfaction it will afford me to bury a bullet in his black heart!" "No, no, no! oh, father, no!" she implored, cling- ing about him. "I shall be, oh, so bright an happy, and the world shall think that I have dis- carded him; but, should you do this mad act you threaten, I should die." Mr. Dunnington well knew the shrinking delicacy of his daughter's nature, and feared that if this affair should be the city gossip it might, indeed, kill her. He therefore kissed her wet face, saying, tenderly,- "I will -be guided by you, my daughter. Only assure me that you hate and despise the hound!" "Oh, father, I would I could! I love him yet, and his baseness has almost broken my heart." She felt his form quiver with passion, and she hastened to say,--   MAGDALEEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   113 "Remember that you have promised to seek no vengeance."  "A nd do you bind me to this promise through pride or through love"? 4 Through 'pride, father,--oh, believe,-through pride."  "I have full confideie in your truth, my love. And now, can you tell how this has been brought about?"      -   - "I can guess, papa. I neglected to tell you that he wrote that he is to be married in a month to Magdalen Shelby." "Curse her! That girl brings misery to all she approaches." Kate looked at him in inquiring astonishment. "I have often heard, papa, that Magdalen took delight in wiling away the lovers of her friends; but I never dreamed that she would blight my love-life, thinking that she loved me too well." "Child, you do not know her. No one has an idea of the diablerie of her nature, save her rejected lovers.- She loves no one but herself I can almost pity Cliton, for I have writhed under her spells." You, papa?" "Yes, I, Kate. She led me on to a declaration for the sole purpose of rejecting and ridiculing me. She said that she was at enmity with all mankind and would work them all the Woe she could. 'The H       10*   "4    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESSE,' heart of man is as wax in my hands,' she said, 'as you know from pleasant experience; and lovers shall hate their lady-loves, and husbands their wives, and all for love of "Magdalen the Enchantress."' Have you any idea whether she intends to marry Clin- ton?" "If-she is what you say, it is utterly impossible to tell what she intends." "Should she not, would you listen to him again?" "Never!" "And now, daughter, you had better go to your room and try to dream away this sorrow. Good- night." He led her to the door, kissed and dismissed her. As she was ascending the stairs, the hall-door was opened, and George entered. She motioned him to- be silent and to come to her. "Well, George, did you see Captain Clinton?" "Yes, missy." "What detained you so'long?" "Well, Missy Katie," answered the man, with some hesitancy, "I went to his boardin'-house an' 'quired for him, but he warn't there. 'Well, Dinah,' said I to de gal dat 'tended de door, 'my young missy gim me a letter, and say I mus' gib it to de cap'in: so if you will just gim me a hint I'll foller in his tracks.'"

KATE scarce realized her great sorrow until ohe met Captain Clinton and Magdalen at a partyat Mr. Richmond's. It required all of her pride to enable her to sustain her wented 'air of coquettish carelessness, when she saw how entirely Captain Clinton was absorbed by his betrothed bride, whose brilliantly beautiful face seemed radiant with hap- piness. "Kate Dunnington has jilted the elegant cap- tain," was whispered from one to another. "Yes: isn't she the most complete flirt you ever saw?" "Yes," responded another, with a laugh; ; and the captain pretends to be dying in love with Magda- len. But that game has been played too often by the masculines to deceive us." When Kate was charged by her young compa- nions with leaving the gallant captain to wear the willow, she would reply, laughingly,-   MLODALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    119 "I verily believe that it is my naturge to break hearts.

"By-the-way," she continued, , "do you remember that you confided a secret to me a short time since? You did not deceive me, though: I had a shrewd suspicion at the time that the love-story was a pretty fiction. I have been hoaxed too often by such stories to put any faith in you. Ah, Kate, you are a sad flirt, I fear." "He was just ten years too old to suit me, Love; and as for his broken heart, it will soon'be mended by the magic spells of the ' Enchantress.'" "Don't talks so lightly of broken hearts, my Katie: yours may break yet," laughed Love. "Think you that there is danger of my heart breaking? Mimne  Ha! ha! ha!" An old gentleman who was standing near laid his hand on Kate's head, and said,' gently, but gravely,-- "Lighter hearts than yours in its lightest mo- ments have broken, my 6hild." "Listen, my Kate," said Love: "this is for your especial benefit:- "Brighter eyes than thine, sweet Katie, Brighter eyes than thine,   120     MAGDALEN 'THE ENCHANTREBS.

Once during the evening her faithless lover asked her to dance, and she laughed and chatted Po like a little flirt that his suspicions of her. interested motives in regard to himself were confirmed..

TIME fled, and the day appointed for Magdalen's marriage arrived. Immediately after the ceremony, which was to take place in St, Patrick's Church, the bridal party was to leave for Tennessee, at the bride's particular request, to visit Captain Clinton's relatives, who were residents of that State. Kate had borne up bravely until the wedding- morn. Feeling unequal to the task of attending, she had absented herself under the convenient plea of a slight indisposition, and, seating herself at her chamber-window, she waited in feverish expectation of the cortge. As the carriage containing the bride and bridegroom rolled past, she threw herself upon the floor, and screamed, in heart-thrilling accents, "Oh, father! father! the carriage-wheels- are cut- ting through my heart!"   i   ^M124   MAGDALUNW TIMO. - ts When George, startled by her cry, ran into the room, he found her still lying where she had fallen. He lifted her gently from the floor and laid her on the bed, when he discovered that there was blood upon her lips and hand. He sent a servant forhis master, another for Dr. Litont and then stood over her, wiping away the blood as it oozed through her white liPEI       88a it Oozed through her white lips. In a few moments the door was thrown open, and Mr. Dunnington entered and stood beside the bed.  "ate, my daughter, my dear little Kate, speak to me." ,            - - She raised her soft eyes, hopeless and despairing now, and murmured,-     .  "Oh, papa, as they passed I felt a sharp pain here," daying her hand, on her bosom,) "that felt as if the wheels had cut through my heart.' "My poor child! my poor broken hearted child!" he said; then, turning to Dr. Linton, '.Will she re- cover from this, sir?" ' There- is no great present danger, Mr. Dnning. ton," answered the physician, trying to speak hope- fully, "but you are aware that your daughter in- herits her mother's delicacy of conistitution, and it is possible consumption may be developed 'by this mental emotion, whatever-it may be, unless the cause is removed."   MAGDALN tENT ENCHANTRESS.   125 "I fear that it cannot be removed, doctor; :and then?" "It were a cruel kindness to deceive you, sir. Under such circumstances, there would be room for but little hope." Mr. Dunnington sank his head upon 'the couch and wept. Please don't, papa: it hurts me," said Kate, lay. ing her blood-stained hand upon his bowed head. He thought only of ministering to his daughter's comfort, and calmed himself.  "What can I do for you, my child?" "Send for Love, please: I want Love." "She means- Miss Richmond," said the physician. "I am going up to the church to---" Mr. Dunnington stopped him by a sign. Dr. Linton gazed at him inquiringly. "Clinton won her love," explained Mr. DTnning- ton, drawing the physician aside, "and they were engaged to be married, when that devilish Magda- len, with her damnable arts, caused him to break the engagement. This was only a month ago; and now they are married. Tell Miss Richmond this, for neither this marriage nor the parties imme- diately interested must be referred to in Kate's pre- sence. To all others, be silent." When Love entered Kate's room, the hemorrhage 'had ceased, and the suffering girl was sweetly sleep- "*   126    MAGDALEN' TTE ERNCTANTaESS ing. Love had been greatly shocked whenn Dr. Linton had related to her all that Mr. Dunnlngton had discovered to him ; and she could not realize that it was true, until she stood beside Kate's sick- bed and gazed upon her pale face. "My poor Katie'^ she isid, i might have known that the wild laughter, the radiant eyes and crimson cheeks of the past month were not caused byper- fect health of body and buoyancy of pirit Stange that I did not perceive they were used aa mask to hide some heart-wound!

In three or four days Kate was far enough re- covered to be about; but in a few weeks she had a second hemorrhage, and from that time her father knew that she must die. The soft flush on har cheeks deepened into a viid crimson, and the faint cough, that ever falls on theear like el, gre more frequent.          a When Love, in answer to Kate's eager inquiries, assured her that no one suspected the real cause of her illness, she smiled with a partial return of her olden brightness, and cried,-  "I have out-generalled them!" THi er father saw the rapid approach of the de- stroyer, and his passionate, almost impious, ravings distressed her greatly.   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   127 "Papa, when I am dead you will love my memory enough to keep the promise you made me?" she asked, anxiously aifd repeatedly. I '-will keep the promise, my dear child; but you do not know how hard it will be to resist the temptation of shooting him should he cross my path."  "But you will, resist it, papa? Besides, you said that he was to be pitied." "Be at rest, my child. Any request that you have made, or may make, shall be held sacred." "Thank you, papag And now I am ging to make what may seem to you a strange request. If Mag- dalen should ever become poor, you mut. give her a portion of dear Aunt Edith's legacy. Something tells me that she will have sorrows equal to mine, rich and happy though she is. Do not forget, papa." "I will remember, love. Is there nothing else?" "Yes, one more request: you must emancipate George and Bettie, and give them what you think proper. Ah, here he is! George, would you like to be free?" "Well, Missy Katie, jest as long as you an' ole marsq lib, I'se a great deal better off dan poor free nigger; but you'll soon put on de white dress, an' de gold crown, and de harp ob de angels," he said, brushing away the tears that filled his eyes, "an'   128    MAGDALEN THE ENCRANTRBSS. ole marse might die sudden, and den I might git a bad marster, dat wouldn't let me wisityour gave." "True," saids his kind master, thoughtfully:  never took that view of the case, George. Indeed, I never thought of death, until my little Katie was stricken down in the hey-day of her youth and beauty. I will see that you and Bettie are free, and you shall be well provided for ere you go forth to, seek your fortune." "'Seuse me, old marse, but I a'n't a-goin' forth to seek my fortin an' hopes to be 'vided for in- dis fam'ly as long, as you libs. I only want de papers in case of 'cessity." "Very well, George: we will arrange every thing to your satisfaction." "You berry kind, ole marse, and Missy Katie's a angel on de yeth! I'se your humble sarvant to command." He made his customary low bow and left the room to answer a rap at the door, and in a few moments returned, ushering in Grace and Love. Grace almost forgot her own heart-ache as she gazed upon the dying girl who bore her suflerings so cheerfully. After conversing upon many subjects Love left the room to prepare some dainty, and Grace asked,- "'Are you .willing to leave this world, Kate, to which we are all so prone to cling,?"

Then H debate the question, and the invariable answer is, 'I would rather die." I know, dear Mrs. Heath, that I ought to wish to live for my father and my friends; but I cannot. You do not know all I have suffered, and therefore cannot realize that I welcome the approach of death as a sweet release." "Kate, child, I have had sufferings equal to yours!" "Do not say so, Mrs. Heath!"Then her father's words foced themselves on her memory, and she repeated them:-"Husbands shall hate their wives, lovers their lady-loves, and all for love of 'Magda- len the Enchantress.' Mrs. Heath, Mrs. Heath, yourhusband loves Magdalen." "Do not speak of this to any one, Kate, and least of all to Love,"said Grace, hastily, as she heard her sister approaching. *   *  * :     *   *  *   * Day by day Kate became more beautiful. Larger, darker, and brighter grew the glorious eyes; fairer the lily, redder the rose; thinner and weaker the fragile form; purer and whiter the soul. She frequently walked in the pure air, tenderly supported by her father: the walks gave place to I   180    MAGDALEN THE NCHANTRESS. rides; the rides to walks from one room to another. Then she was lifted from couch to invalid-chair, and from chair to couch again, when even a touch was agony to the weakened and aching form. She often cliped her small hands and compressed her pale lip to suppress a cry of anguish. Relatives and friends saw the patient suffering they were powerless to relieve, and sorrowed deeply. At length she saw but dimly, heard imperfectly. The once musical voice was changed to hoarse mur- murings, the dazzling white and brilliant red that had held brief sway upon brow and cheek gave place to the dull gray hue that betokens the speedy coming of death: still, she bore all uncomplainingly. One evening, just as the bright stars were peep- ing through the shadowy twilight, she raised herself to a sitting posture, and cried,-- "Papa, tell Charles that I loved him in life and death, and say to Magdalen that I forgave her. Love, the shadows of death are closing around me, and I shall soon sleep, oh, so sweetly!" When she started up, her father had placed his arms about her, and he held her tolHgsi art until the last breath died out: then he-lid her head gently on the piloi0^Wnd closed her eyes. Exactly seven mionths after Captain Clinton's marriage with Magdalen, Kate was laid in her grave.   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.          181 CHAPTER XVtl..

B. DILlON. MR. DUNNINGTON    passed  slowly from   the room wherein his only child lay dead.    Bowed with grief, he entered his own chamber, to weep such bitter   132    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. tears as he had not wept since he laid his fair young wife in the tomb. We will leave him alone with his heart's agony and return to the chamber of death. Love would not permit her friend to be enveloped in a shroud. She willed that her father should remember his child as sleeping, not dead. Nor was she to be touched by hireling hands. The-fingers of sorrowing friends fashioned the snowy bride-like robe of fleecy India mull, and she was arrayed in her death-toilette as tenderly as if her wasted form could still shrink from rude touch. Love's fingers braided lovingly the brown tresses. Her hand placed upon the fair bosom, whose life-throbs were stilled, a cluster of white moss-rosebuds intermin- gled with lilies of the valley. "How beautiful!" was the whispered comment of friends as they looked upon the fair young face, which, instead of wearing the waxen hue usual in death, had a soft, peaceful appearance, as if she were indeed but 'sleeping,.oh, hso swety." .When the morning came, and the father, stood beside his loved one,o gazin upon her calm, angelic beauty, if prayer of his could have recalled her to life with her blighted hopes and weary spirit, he would not have uttered it. He rather rejoiced that she was released from the sorrow that had crushed both-heart and body. Yet, as he knelt and imr   MAODALEN TB BENCHANTRESS.   183 printed a kiss upon. the mute, cold lips, he inly mur- mured,-  "1Would .that I too might lay down the burden of life, and calmly rest beside you, my darling Katie!" The second day after the wing of the dark angel had left its shadow upon the heart and household of Mr. Dunnington, the loved one was borne away to be laid beside her mother. Mrs. Dunnington was not buried in a public cemetery, but in one of earth's loveliest spots, which she, in a sportive mood, had declared should be her last resting-place. It was upon the estate of a maiden aunt who lived in Virginia, and with whom she had spent much of her young girlhood. During her bridal tour she visited this aunt, and, in showing her husband the beauties of the domain, she took him to this her favorite haunt, which she had chris. tened The Fays Bower. Throwing herself upon a rustic seat, which had been erected for her especial use in her girlish ) days,. "Here," said she, looking into her hosbat's face, "I have woven some of the -b;ightest; day, dreams of my life; and here, should -I die early, you must lay me to rest, when I shall dream no more.",  Itt was near the bank of the Potomac, and a sing- ing brooklet almost laved her feet as it swept mur- 12   134    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. muringly along to mingle its waters with that beautiful river. But a few years passed ere Death claimed the fair young wife as his own; and here she was laid to rest. Katie, in her annual visits to this princely estate, which, by deed of gift, had now become her own, loved to add to the beauty of the spot which Nature herself had made so fair, by planting choice flowers beside her mother's grave. Now she is th rest beside that dear mother. Numerous friends are gathered round- to witness- the last sad rite. The sun is shining brilliantly, but two weeping willows bend their slender, graceful boughs above the graves, and cast a softened shadow over the burial-place of the young and beautiful,-mother and daughter. The coffin stood beside the open grave. A brief prayer was said, a few touching remarks were made by an aged clergyman, who performed a- imiar service for her mother, and the coffin was lowered amid sobs and tears. "Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust," was sobbed rather than said by the white-haired minister, as he cast-a handful of earth upon the coffin. Event the two men who stood near to fill up the grave were so impressed with the scene that they were careful to cause the earth to slide from their spades as noiselessly as possible. A small slab of white mar- ble, inscribed with the name, together with the date   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   135 of birth and death, of her who slept beneath, was placed at the head of Katie Dunnington's grave. When theggrave was heaped. and shaped, a rose- bush, laden with bursting buds and snowy blossoms, was placed upon it by the hand of the faithful George. Then, and not till then, the sympathizing crowd turned and left the bereaved father kneeling alone beside the old and new made grave. No, not alone; for George, after placing the rose-bush upon the grave of his idolized mistress, had stepped back and joined his sister Bettie, who stood weeping near by. They still stood there, but the sorrowing father was-so absorbed in his grief that he observed them not.. Giving utterance to the thoughts that op- pressed him, he exclaimed,- "Oh, my darling, no more will your hand beau- tify your mother's grave. My poor old heart is broken! I too must soon rest beside you: who then will pluck the weeds that grow upon the graves of my heart's treasures, and plant flowers in their stead?" "We will," said Bettie and George, stepping for- ward to where their master knelt. "Never, long as I lives," continued George, "shall a weed grow near my dear Miss Katie's. And the flowers she loved so well shall always blossom on her grave." "God bless you both!" was the only reply Mr. Dunnirigton could make.   136    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. Years have flown since this sad burial of " the young and beautiful." The "graves of a household" are now shaded by those weeping willows, and the singing brooklet still murmurs by, with a mournful cadence in its tone, as if it were tolling a requiem for the early dead. Mr. Dunnington lived many years after the death of his daughter. But he sleeps at last. George and Bettie, though free, still live upon the estate: their cabin is in the vicinity of this lovely spot, and the promise made over the grave of their idolized Miss Katie has been faithfully kept. Flowers of rare beauty blossom above the quiet dead, and their rich odors float like incense upon the winds of heaven, speaking the undying devo- tion of these two faithful hearts.

Sorrow treads heavily, and leaves behind A deep impression, e'en when she departs; While Joy trips by with steps light as the wind, And scarcely leaves a trace upon our hearts Of her faint footfalls: only this is sure,- In this world naught save misery can endure." SOON after Kate's death, Captain Clinton was ordered to sea, and he brought Magdalen to Wash- ington, where she was to remain during his ab- sence. As may be supposed, Captain Clinton had already repented of his hasty marriage; for Magdalen was not the same fascinating creature as a wife that she had been when a maiden. She was easily angered: he had grown weary of the domestic storms that raged around him, and he was glad thrt he would soon exchange them  for the to him  less fearful storms of the sea. Grace called to see them when they returned to the city; but Love positively refused. She did not meet them until some weeks after their return when she met them at Dr. Linton's. 12*   188    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. As she entered, leaning' upon Lionel's arm, Cap. tain Clinton, who was standing near the door, has- tened forward to greet her. She acknowledged his polite attentions with a cold hauteur that surprised him. "The same wayward little lady that I parted with six months since," he said, playfully "Pardon me, sir, but I must begleave to say that 1 am never wayward with my friends." "And so you class me with your enemies? Since when t" "Since I discovered that you were the bitterest enemy of my dearest friend."

What's the matter with that fiery little crea- ture?" inquired the captain.

I asked her to reveal to me but a   MAQDAIEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    139 single mean or unworthy act of which you were guilty, and I would cut you." "It strikes me, Percy, that, if she is thus flighty with a mere aeqtaintance, she must be a complete little--I was about to say devil, but I'll substi- tute will-o'-the-.rip, with a lover. Eh,-my boy?" "'Gad, but you're about right, my dear friend. I am just about as certain of her love to-night as I was the moment I met her. Sometimes she is the sweetest, dearest, little creature, but can change in an instant, and often flies into a passion at a single word. And yet I love her with all my heart and soul. I see the lights and shades of her character; for she-is too honest to hide her faults. For the life of me, captain, I can't tell whether she ir flirting or not. The game is all in her own hands, for I showed mine long ago."         f - "The more fool-you," said the captain, laughbig: "if you want to win a woman's heart, treat her with indifference. Take my advice--make love to the lady she most dislikes, and I dare wager, ten to one, that, ere you leave this fair city, lady Love will be your promised bride." "Iwill try the experiment, captain." "You are wise. But come: I value Miss Rich- mond's friendship far too highly to relinquish it without a struggle. I must endeavor to make peace."   "O    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.

"Will you forgive me, in her name, Miss Rich- mond, when I assure you that I thought her: per- fectly indifferent to me?" "I forgive and pity you, sir: she never blamed you'." "I can never forgive myself," murmured Captain Clinton as he turned away; "and she, poor inno- cent child, carried a breaking heart under her gay exterior.

As I recall the past, I find that I was all too willing to. believe her totally devoid of heart and all womanly feeling, while I invested, Magdalen with every beautiful and noble quality. Now I am undeceived, and. can see them as they really were:-Magdalen, in her thirst for admiration and power, sacrificing pride, delicacy, and truth to win a man she did not love, because she had, been told that he would not fall an easy victim to her resplendent loveliness; "and Kate blending so beautifully in her character womanly love, pride, and delicacy. Kate died-almost a saint; and Magdalen-I blush to admit it even to myself -lives a hypocrite in love and in religion." Magdalen saw the gloom that overshadowed his face, and, approaching him, laid her hand gently on his arm, and, raising her eyes to his, murmured, in her musical tones,- "What troubles you, riy husband?" The glance of the magnetic eyes had now no power to chase away sad memories; and he an- swered:-          . "The past, Magdalen." "I flattered myself that you were saddened by the thought of our approaching separation," she said, somewhat angrily.- She was beginning to dis- cover-that herhusband did not regard her with the all-absorbing love, that had been shown her for-a   MAGDALEN -THE ENCHANTRESS.   143 brief while after her marriage, and which she, in her proud selfishness, required. - I must be more gentle," she thought, "or the peering world will notice his coldness toward me." The soft eyes re- garded him reproachfully as she repeated, gently,- "I flattered myself that you were saddened by the thought of our approaching separation." He started slightly, for he had forgotten her presence. "We will be happier parted, Magdalen. There has been but'little love between us recently; never any on your side." "You think so, Charles?" "I know it, Magdalen." I "As you please. When do you join your ves- sel?" "A week from to-morrow." "So soon?" "Yes." "And you will be absent three years?" "I will be with you at the close of three years, if I do not find a grave beneath the ocean-waves." "And have you any such presentiment?" "I must confess that I have." "You are gloomy, Charles: we shall meet again." "I fear not, Magdalen." "I hope not," she muttered, between her teeth, as   "4    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRKSS. her eyes rested on Neville, who was approaching with Grace. "I have gained what I wished,-his fortune." Neville invariably treated Grace with cold polite ness in society, but he wounded her sensitive nature deeply in many ways when alone, with her. She was slowly sinking under her sorrow, and was no longer the gay, cheerful creature she had been before her marriage. The color had faded out from her cheeks, and the once light step was slow and languid. There were many surmises as to the cause of the evident trouble between them; but she had never confided it even to her parents. I        't      ,  . . ..

ON the morning preceding Lionel's departure, he joined several ladies and gentlemen in a morning ride. He had tried every means he could think of to obtain a direct answer from Love as to whether she loved him, and a promise to marry him on his return, without success.   As a last resort, he deter- mined to have recourse to Captain Clinton's advice, and endeavor to arouse her jealousy. When the party started, he rode off with Miss Lee, a young lady who reigned the belle par excellence of Alexan- dria. Love was. not left forlorn by his desertion, however; for both Willie Calvert and Jack O'Niel. K    .     13   "6    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. escorted her. Although both were admirers of Love, they were warm friends, and made common cause against Lionel. Love, though perfectly con- vinced that Lionel loved her, and her alone, was not at all pleased that he should be, even in appearance, devoted to another. She did not attempt to conceal her displeasure and discontent, and rode onward in angry silence. When Jack or Willie hazarded an inquiry, she gave in return short and pettish an- swers. The fair Alexandrian wore a small cluster of rosebuds on her bosom, and, after coquettishy resisting the entreaties of Lionel for some time, she gave him one. liHe pressed it gallantly to his lips and fastened it inrius button-hole. "This is going a little too far," thought Love. "I must put a stop to it." Her horse was a well-trained, well-tried favorite, and she knew she could rely upon him. She slipped partially from her saddle, and gave the horse a slight blow. As he sprang forward, she gave a wild cry of seeming terror. Lionel, hearing the cry and seeing the clinging, helpless forni of his beloved, as she passed him like a flash, forgot Miss Lee and started instantly in pursuit fHer horse wa far superior to his, and she led4:i&on his harum-carum chase for a quarter of a mile, then suddenly re- sumed her legitimate position, checked her steed; and laughed in his face.

You are impertinent, sir."  Her red lip curled scornfilly.4nd she darted from him and rejoined Jack and Willie, who were ap proaching, qnmindful of his agitated "Stay! I implore you, Love,-Miss Richmond,- but one moment!" Lionel, as in duty bound, resumed his place be- side Miss Lee, who found all her arts powerless to rouse him from the saddened silence into which he had fallen. Poor fellow! he was in exceeding great trouble, for he was fearful that Love was really angry because of his unlucky reference to her jeoalusy. II must make i-y peace," he thought; and, fall- ing back, he whispered, hastily, "For Heaven's sake, Jack O'Niel, change places with me." "Certainly, if the change is agreeable to Miss   "8    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. Richmond," answered Jack, with provoking de- liberation. "Miss Love, is it your pleasure I resign my place to Mr. Percy?" "Certainly not," she answered, haughtily. Lionel's face flushed hotly, as with a low bow he spurred forward and joined Miss Lee. "Make a fool of yourself, and give a woman- the knowledge that she possesses power over you, and she will torment you to death," he muttered. In less than a half-hour after the return of the party, Love Richmond sat beside a table, cool and composed, while Lionel Percy walked .rapidly through the parlor, as was his wont when: agitated. Love followed him with her eyes; but he did not turn his toward her. He finally became somewhat less excited, and paused before her. "Wy is it, you most incomprehensible of woman- kind, that you will not give me this promise? Am ' I too old?"  She could not help laughing as she looked upon the almost boyish figure of her lover. "itNo." "Am I ugly?" T"No." Is it my want of wealth?" "No." "My low rank?" "No."1   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   149 "What can be the objection? You told me, but a moment since, that you loved me." "Better than any one I have ever seen." "Well, do I not love you?" "I don't know." "But you do know." "Yes! you care a great deal for me when you flirt with another in my very presence, and wear her flowers." She was playing nervously with her rings, but a half-smile was on her lips. He tore the rose-bud that Miss Lee had given him, from his button-hole, and threw it to her with a smothered curse on the jealous capricesof women in general and of this one in particular. She pulled the rose to pieces, and then said, "Oh, yes; you give me her flowers as of no value to you; and when you are with her you give her mine, I doubt not." "I swear------" "You need not," she interrupted: "it will not convince me. She is an acknowledged belle, and you are flattered by her preference; and I tell you I am not to be loved or neglected at your fickle will!" "And I tell you that I am not to be encouraged and repulsed at your fickle will I will leave you this instant, and Washington to-night!" 13*   150    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. He looked very determined; but she knew her power, and, raising her dark, melancholy eyes to his, said, 'rchly,-- "No, you won't."  The glance and the tone were instantaneous in effect; and, instead of going, he tossed his cap on the floor and seated himself beside her. "Love," he said, seriously, "I assure you, on my honor as a soldier and a gentleman, that you are the only lady I have ever loved. You have to-day given me a similar assurance: why not, then, promise me your hand, to be yielded when I return?" "I see no just cause or impediment why I should not. But of what value are promises? They are easily broken," she answered, smiling. "But you promise?" "I promise," she said, giving him the little white hand he coveted. He kissed it gently, almost reve- rently, and then drew it through his arm and led her to the piano. "I wish you to sing me one more song, that I may hold in remembrance when Ir am gone. Nay, no tears: I will not have them." "What shall it be?"  "Not one of your usual wild songs of broken hearts, nor yet your mocking ones of love's incon- stancy, but something joyous and light. What say you to the caption of 'Woman's Wiles'?"   MAGDALEL   THE ENCHANTRESS.       151 "That I am   capable of treating of the subject," she answered, laughing. You are perfect in the practice, I am well aware. Now for the theory-" "Will you ever cease talking and listen?" "I am listening." "Well, what do you hear?"' she asked, saucily. "The   music  of your voice, which    is sweeter melody than any song I have ever heard." "Peace, flatterer!  ,Listen:- "'Oh, Aie's eyes are brighter, And Allie's cheeks are fair; My figure, too, is slighter,  And lacks her queely air.'

Let the flash and sparkle of unacknowledged love subside into the humdrum   engagement, and love soon becomes tasteless and insipid, and you would cast it away as readily as you did that glass of cham- pagne yesternight, when you pronounced it 'dull, dead,', because the sparkling foam had disappeared from the brimming beaker," said Love, gayly. "Be- sides," she went on, more seriously, "those same 'wiles' are our protection.

"I bow in admiration of your superiority in the science of keeping a-poor fellow on the rack. Pray, who gave you lessons?" "It is a gift which but few possess in an eminent degree; and it can never be acquired." They continued talking of many things of interest to them, until Captain Clinton sent a message to Lionel, stating that he must be prepared to start that evening. Lionel bade Love good-by, and as- sured her that if it were possible he would see her again before he left; but he was compelled to go without that pleasure.   154    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.

"ONEL was saddened by the present parting, and was, at the same time, somewhat fearful that Love might change ere the three long years of probation were ended. But he cast aside his imaginary trou- bles when, two weeks after leaving the American shores, Captain Clinton became suddenly and alarm- ingly ill. He devoted himself to his friend, nursing him with the gentleness and care of a woman. It was soon apparent to all that he would not recover; and Lionel once said to him,- "Captain Clinton, how can you look death so bravely in the face when you reflect upon the terri- ble tidings that will be transmitted to your young wife?" The answer startled him:- "The news of my death will be most welcome to her."   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   155 Lionel looked the astonishment he felt; and Cap- tain Clinton proceeded:- "Lionel, I have nothing to cling to on earth, and much to hope for in heaven. My second' marriage was the great mistake of my life: it has been my unhappiness. Had I never met Magdalen, I would still be happy, I doubt not, in the memory of my lost Emily or .the presence of one who was almost as dear,-poor martyred Kate. I love Magdalen sufficiently to be pained by her faults and follies, but not well enough to wish to live for the purpose of leading her ;o better things." "But, my dear sir," said Lionel, "you may judge her too harshy: perhaps it Was her great love for you that prompted her to play upon you and sup- plant her rival." You are mistaken: she does not love me, nor never did. She married me for the same object that she led me to believe actuated Kate,--my wealth." Impossible! She is in her own right a wealthy heiress." "She was,-not is. While in Europe, she lost her fortune by gaming; and when a woman sinks to that level it were better to allow her to take her own course." He-spoke with so much agitation and pain that Lionel begged him to cease. He insisted, however, ,   i{   156    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. upon detailing every thing in regard to the plot that Magdalen and Henry Calvert had engaged in for the purpose of leading him to break with Kate and into a marriage with Magdalen. "How did you learn this?" inquired Lionel: "surely neither Mrs. Clinton nor Calvert were mad enough to discoverit?" "Do you remember the evening Miss Richmond informed me of Kate's death?" "Distinctly." "On the following evening I left home at seven o'clock to visit a friend, telling Magdalen that I would probably not return until late. Not finding the friend I sought, I returned home and threw my- self in an arm-chair in the little reception-room next the parlor. In a few minutes after my entrance, Calvert called and was shown into the .parlor. When Magdalen entered, he demanded five thou- sand dollars. She told him that she could not give him so large a sum, as she dared not ask it of me without giving some explanation concerning the use to which it would be put. 'He said to her that a bargain was a bargain, and that if she did not immediately place in his hands the amount required he would present his claim to me. She, who is pride personified to all others, knelt to him and with tears and sobs besought him to be merciful oto her. From their further conversation I learned the   MAGDALEN THE ENCHAITRESS.   157 bitter ftct that she had lost her fortune at the gaming-table, instead of dispensing it in charity, as she had told me. You may possibly imagine the mortification and pain this revelation caused me, but can form no idea-of my horr6r when I heard her coolly urge, when all else had failed to satisfy him, that she would give him thrice the sum he claimed when I was dead. "'You know,' she concluded, that you once said that the perils of the sea were many: why not pity me for a time and be benefited in the end?' This did not avail, for he still insisted upon having the money; and she offered him herijewels, which were of great value. He seemed to experience a peculiar pleasure in tormenting her, and refused them. She was in despair, and suffered apparently the extreme of terror and shame. I had sat as it were stupefied, but managed after a time to compose myself suffi- ciently to consider what course I should pursue under the circumstances. My first impulse, as a matter of course, was to thrust him from my house; but the second sober thought came to my aid, and I resolved to spare Magdalen a public exposure, and at the same time conceal from both Calvert and herself the knowledge of which I had become acci- dentally possessed. I left the house by a private door and. proceeded to the front entrance. When I entered the parlor, Magdalen sat with perfect self- "   158    MAGDALEN THE ENOHANTRESS. possession, quietly conversing with Calvert, who arose when he saw me and offered his hand. I bhook it with apparent cordiality, and we conversed for some minutes. After a time, I turned to Mag- dalen and said to her that I had really forgotten that 'pin-money' was indispensable to a lady, and that I had -five ihousnid dollars which I would place at her 4isposall if she would accept it. She thanked me, and nothing more was said of the matter until Calvert took his leave. When the door closed upon him, she bent over me, with a hasty though half-hesitating movement, and kissed me. I thought she would confess all, and if she had done soI could have freely forgiven her; but she only spoke to ask me to permit her to give the 'pin-money' in charity. I turned from her sick at heart, and since that time I have been careless of life." Captain Clinton, after lingering for some weeks, died, as a brave man should, calmly and fearlessly. "Many of my sins," he said, "have been sins of ignorance; and I have full and entire faith that I shall be mercifully judged." As his life drew to its close, his mind wandered, and he seemed to have forgotten both Kate and Magdalen, remembering only Emily; and he died with her. name on his lips, her image in his heart When her husband's death was communicated to her, Magdalen feigned violent grief, and alarmed   MAQDALEk TfB ENCHANTRESS,    159 and shocked her friends by her passionate outcries and blasphemous murmurs against the will of God. A few months after her husband's death, a babe was born to her; and all the intense love of which her wayward, passionate nature was capable centred on this son. "He will be the joy and pride of my lifde" she said, pressing him to her bosom, "and he wmst-have wealth to support the honors to which he will at- tain. I must marry again for his sake; for Clinton's fortune was far less than I thought it." ,       -     .   160    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTEtSS. CHAPTER XXT.

A GROUP of servants were gathered in the kitchen of Neville Heath's residence, discussing, as servants will, the affairs of the household. Among the number we recognise Aunt Bell, who declares that she "is jist as young as ever." There, too, is Mr. Dunnington's servant George.

I b'lieve Miss Grace is dead!" George awaited no second bidding, but. darted away on his errand, while Aunt Bell hurried up the stairs, closely followed, by the terror-stricken ser- vants, who crowded around the bed whereon their well-beloved young mistress was lying coll and white. That she had arisen and dressed was evi- dent; for a white robe was girded around her slender waist, and the glossy curls of her bright brown hair had been carefully arranged. George stopped at Mr. Richmond's 0on his way to Dr. Linton's, and told Mrs. Richmond that Aunt Bell said that Miss. Graca was dead, but that he guessed she had only fainted. Mrs. Richmond and Love hurried away, much alarmed, the former stay- ing but an instant to direct a servant to seek Mr. Richmond and Clarence and to tell them that Mrs. Heath was very ill. When Mrs. Richmond and Love entered Graee's room, they found her lying, robed as for burial, on the bed. Dr. Linton leaned over her, while the ser- vants stood near the door, weeping silently. The golden-haired, white-robed figure, lying so pale and still, recalled to Love all the wild visions of her   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    163 childhood, and, stepping forward, she laid her hand on her sister's bosom, saying, in tones low, clear, and solemn,- "You need not pain your kind heart by telling us, Dr. Linton. She is dead." "Yes; of disease of the heart.' There was a wild cry, and old Aunt Bell threw herself on her knees beside her dead darling. "Oh, Miss Grace, honey," she sobbed, "why did you die? why did you die? And, worse than all, to die all alone! Oh, Miss Grace, Miss Grace!" "Not alone"- rang the clear, musical voice again, -" not alone; God was with her, and the pure angels. Where is your religion, Aunt Bell? Where your resignation to God's holy will?" The old woman swayed her form slowly to and fro, 'moaning,-  "My little blue-eyed baby, who used to be afraid to go to sleep in a dark room by herself, to die all alone! Oh, Miss Grace, Miss Grace!" The poor old creature could not be prevailed upon to leave her child, as she called Grace, until she was buried; and even, then she spent a large portion of her time at her mistress's grave, begging her to "come back to her poor old mammy."   164     MAUDALRN THE ENCHANTRESS. CHAPTER XXIII. If spirits pure as those who kneel Around the throne of light above The power of beauty's spell could feel And lose a heaven for woman's love, What marvel that a heart like mine Enraptured by thy charms should be, Forget to bend at glory's shrine, And lose itself-aye, heaven-for thee? MxMOAUL. GRACE had long been in poor health, but her friends had felt but little uneasiness concerning her; and, when it was announced that she was dead, they were shocked beyond measure. This sudden sorrow fell heavily upon the mem- bers of her own family; but none felt it so deeply as Clarence, who tenderly loved his good and beau. tiful sister. He had  long  been aware of the estrangement existing between his sister and her husband, and had watched them closely to dis- cover the cause. He had once besought Grace to reveal it; but she had silenced, not satisfied him, by assuring him that Neville was not to blame. On the evening of the day of Grace's funeral, Magdalen sat in her splendid drawing-room, with   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.;   165 her, boy on her lap. 'He was a beautiful child, and it was little wonder that his mother idolized him. He had the dark hair and colorless complexion of his beautiful mother, and the grand Napoleonic forehead, small beautifully-curved mouth, and large flashing blue eyes of his father. Captain Clinton had been dead more than a year, but his widow still wore black: she hhad never worn mourning. Her' usual toilette was a rich black velvet or satin robe, with delicate lace collar and under-sleeves. She had the good taste, however, to discard jewels, with the exception of a magnificent diamond brooch, and her wedding-ring. The babe, who rested quietly on her bosom, was dressed in a long white robe richly embroidered, the short sleeves looped up with heavy jewelled chain-bracelets. Magdalen seemed to be thinking of something which deeply moved her, for she suddenly lifted her child upright, and said, with a low laugh of mingled triumph and pleasure,- . "Ah, Charlie, boy, your mamma is very happy, both for your sake and her own. The woman who has been her hated rival for many years is dead. But she stood in your way, too, my darling: now I shall have his heart, and you shall have his fortune, my bright one!" Again the low laughter floated through the room. Ere it died away, an eager step sounded in the hall,   166   MAGDALEN THE EBCHANTRESS. and in a moment after the door was thrown open and the subject of her reverie stood in her presence, -- with an exultant light in the eyes that should have been dim with weeping for the young wife who had just been buried from their sight. "Why, Neville, is it you?" said Magdalen. "I have been thinking of you."  ' Grace is dead, Clinton is dead, Magdalen. I am free to ask your hand; you are free to give it. Many times during your widowhood I have dared to hope that you deceived both yourself and me by saying that you had cast me from your heart. Am I not right? Tell me, O Magdalen, that you can love me as in the olden time, when your glorious eyes sank beneath the glance of mine. Tell me, O Magdalen!" "Never with the same love, Neville. That love has grown and strengthened in the years that have passed since 'the olden time,' until it is as another thing."  "Is it so, Magdalen? is it indeed so? How doubly proud and happy I shall be when you are both mine,.-my beautiful wife, my beautiful child! In two weeks, Magdalen, I shall claim you." "In two weeks? What will her family, what will the world, say?" "Whatever my sins may be, Magdalen, hypo- crisy is not of the number. I cannot pretend to   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    167 be sorry when I am glad.  Thou art my world henceforth; I am thine. What need we care for aught else? In two weeks, I repeat, I shall claim you.               . "So be it. I am content."' He kissed her, then bent over the babe with a like intent; but the child, with a cry, hid his face on his mother's bosom. Neville's face clouded with displeasure at this demonstration on the part of the infant, and Mag- dalen hastened to apologize:- "Charlie, in common with all babies, has an antipathy to kisses. Pray, forgive the naughty boy." "Oh, certainly; but I wish he had not turned from my proffered caress." He spoke pleasantly, but he had taken a dislike to the child. He was irritated that the pure-souled child should shrink from, the contaminating touch of his polluted lips. "' Magdalen, there is one thing I wish to ask of you: will you not, for my sake, renounce Catholi- cism?" She laughed. "Bah, Neville! I was never a Catholic, save in name." "But you will renounce the name?" "Certainly, and join any church you wish."   168    MAGDALEN- THE ENCHANTRESS. "Do as you wish on that score, but renounce Catholicism."  "Never fear. It is too difficult to be a Catholic, either of the so-called Romish or reformed faith: therefore I have no desire to trouble myself about the one or the other." The good. people of Washington were thrown into a perfect whirl of gossiping excitement when the marriage contracted by Neville and Magdalen was published to the world. There were low whispers that Grace had been poisoned. These whispers grew louder, and finally reached Clarence. It came to light, too, that the newly-married had been lovers for years, and the causes of Grace's disquiet and Kate Dunnington's sudden illness and speedy death, which had heretofore been inexpli- cable mysteries to the curious, were made manifest.- Clarence went earnestly to work to discover if there was any foundation in the vague report that Grace had been poisoned. He soon discovered that there was much suspicion, but no proof. iNeither could he find the source from whence the repor:thEad originated. Clarence felt convinced that his sister had not died of the heart-disease, and resolved to take the law into his own hands. He sent Neville a challenge; but the latter, knowing his brother-in- law's cause to be just, refused to meet him, on the   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   169 plea that he could not fight the brother of his late wife. During the excitement attendant upon the sudden death of Grace, the hasty marriage of Neville and Magdalen, and the contemplated duel between Neville and Clarence, Magdalen received a visit from one whom she had come to regard as her evil'genius. I refer to Henry Calvert. "So, Magdalen," he said, in his old, familiar way, "there is a faint likelihood that your white and slender neck may wear another carcanet than the diamond necklace which encircles its fair propor- tions now." "What now?" '"Haven't you heard the rumors that have been floating through the city since your marriage? By- the-way, that precipitant act was scarcely prudent,-- certainly not decent."  "But these rumors: what are they?" "That you poisoned Grace Heath." "My God!" "Wttdoes that mean?--fear?" FPear! Whathave I to fear?" "Arrest, trial, conviction, sentence, death!" She shuddered. "I am innocent of her death! They dare not charge me6 with it!" "Hush, and listen to me.

They crush me." And-they may kill you." "Are you a man, or are you a devil?" she cried, wildly. "It is of no avail to endeavor tO conceal aught from you. Listen. Do you remember that I once said that Grace was delicate and might fade from earth in a few years?" "Yes."  "Do you remember an observation made by you on that occasion?"' "Yes. The words were these :- Particularly if a certain' fir friend of hers, who shall be nameless,   lMAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRSS.   171 being solicitous about preserving her beauty, should employ a well-known agent called arsenic.' " i "Your words rang in my ear continually, but I feared exposure too much to attempt to put them into practice. After returning from Italy, urged by some unaccountable impulse, I married Clinton. In a few months he died. The temptation to poison Grace Heath revived, and grew stronger day by day, until I could resist no longer, and then- " "You poisoned her."  "No, no, no! I mingled poison but once in what I sent her: then my courage failed me, and I threw the drug into the fire. It is possible that she never tasted the poisoned jelly; and, even admitting she did, it could not injure her. The plan of my pro- ceeding was to administer the arsenic in minute particles until it became necessary to the prolon- gation of life, and then withdraw it. I swear to you, by all my hopes of heaven, that I am innocent, save in intent." "Precious little to swear by," he said, dryly. "But suppose we settle the matter? How much will you give me to withhold the knowledge I pos. sess?"  "What you will," she answered, eagerly. "Good! Ten thousand dollars will do for the present." "So much?"   172    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. It is a small sui to me. As we are well-tried fiends, I may as well give you my confidence.

I have no words I My voice is in my sword.--SHAKSPEAB. IT chanced, a few evenings after Neville refused to accept Clarence's challenge, that they met in the reading-room of the Indian Queen. - Clarence, when he observed Neville, immediately approached and struck him in the face, saying,- "Coward, will you meet,me now?" "I cannot forgive a blow, neither the eithet you have bestowed upon me," said Neville, ini ones that sounded strangely hoarse and low. His face was deadly pale, save where the one crimson spot of shame burned upon his cheek. "I will meet. you; but I appeal to you, gentlemen," (turning to the witnesses of the rencontre,) "that I have not sought this quarrel: it was forced upon me." They exchanged cards, and Clarence bowed and withdrew. He was waited upon in the course of the following day by Neville's second, whom he re, ferred to Jack O'Niel. These gentlemen arranged 156   174    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. that the meeting should tak6 place on the following morning at daybreak, and that the. weapons should be swords. "I am sorry for this thing to be consummated," said Jack: "it seems unnatural that these two men, who have been brothers in love as well as in law, should meet each other with the avowed intent of taking the life one of the other. Can we do nothing to effect a reconciliation?" "I fear not," was the answer: "better let the affair proceed; and, as the sword has been selected, there is but little fear that it will terminate fatally." Clarence spent the night preceding the duel in writing to his family and to Agnes. "Agnes, my first and only love," he wrote, "it may be that I shall never look upon your sweet face again in life; and I therefore proceed to justify my. self in your eyes. You are aware of all that my poor sister suffered at the hands of that arch hypo- crite, Neville Heath, during their brief married life,' for the sake of a woman who was not worthy to touch the hem of Grace's garment. Not content with blighting her happiness, he must e'en take the life that was, it may be, of little worth to her, but which was much to us. There is no proof that he murdered her, but that he did I am convinced; and, even admitting his innocence of the crime of mur- der, her wrongs were great enough to make him   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    175 merit punishment, and he shall receive it at my hands, or I shall die beneath his. Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, and I will repay,' whispers your pure, patient woman's heart; but, my Agnes, Icannot wait. The same planet cannot hold us both; for, should I meet him, I might not be possessed of sufficient self-control to resist the temptation to kill him without giving him a fair chance of defending that life which is so dear to all and doubly dear to him and to me. To him, because he loves his pre- sent wife; to me, because I love my Agnes, who will soon, if all goes well with me, be mine. My heart fails me as I write, and, for the first time, a chilling doubt finds room within its depths,-a doubt of what your feelings will be in the event of the fall of my adversary. Agnes, you will not call me murderer and cast me off, should all the world ao so? No, no!-it cannot be; and I will doubt no more. Your love will follow me, dearest, through life, and, if need be, light me through the darkness of the Valley of the Shadow of Death.- 'Agnes, Agnes, should my life be the forfeit, you will mourn for me, but not hopelessly: we shall meet again. Jack waits for me. I must go. My last moments before the meeting are devoted to you, dearest. With a kiss on your sweet eyes and sweeter lips, I say farewell,-perhaps forever. Pray for me, Agnes. I go.              -CLARENCE."   176    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. He finished hastily, for Jack had called him more than once. As he passed into an adjoining room, he gave the letter for Agnes to. his servant, bidding him deliver it to her., Then, with Jack and a sur: geon, he entered the carriage that was in waiting, and drove to the tryst of death. When they reached the place of appointment, they found Neville's party already on the ground. Neville and Clarence removed their coats, and the latter received the weapons from Jack. Instead of tendering them to Neville, he tossed them at his feet and bade him select his weapon. Neville leaned and took possession of one of them, say- ing,- "I have no fear that, you have tampered with them-. You are a man of honor." "And as such am sadly out of my sphere in your presence." Their attendants had withdrawn a few paces; and Neville,U as is usual, offered his hand, which was haughtily rejected by Clarence, who bowed with cold politeness. "I cannot touch the hand that is, in the sight of ,God and the angels, stained with my sister's blood." "I wronged her'deeply, Clarence; but I swear to you that I am innocent of the crime of which I stand charged by you." "Enough! Must I again say coward?"   MAODALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   T" Their swords crossed with that dull clashing sound which sends a thrill of horror through the frame wheni it falls on the ear. They were fairly matched, and some slighth wounds had' been given and received; but the contest promised to be long, and it was impossible to judge which would bethe victor, when the sun, which had been overcast, sud- denly flashed forth in golden glory and shone full in the eyes of Clarence, who stood with his face to the east. Dazzled and bewildered by the sudden glow, he was thrown off his guard, and the sword of his antagonist was sheathed in his bosom. Jack sprang forward, caught the swaying form in his arms, and laid him on the sward. The others gathered around, and Neville knelt beside him, cry- ing, ildly,- "Now, indeed, am I a murderer! But oh, be- lieve me, Clarence, when I solemnly swear to you that I am innocent of Grace's death." "What fiend possessed you to do this deed, Heath?" said the surgeon, aside. "You- are indeed guilty of his death: the wound is mortal." "Too well I know it, and am most wretched." His friend drew him from the group and placed him in the carriage, which was driven rapidly away. "This can scarcely prove fatal, doctor," said Jack, who still supported Clarence's head on his breast. The hemorrhage is slight." Me   178    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. 4If you know any thing of the sword-exercise, you will understand what follow when the lungs are lacerated,-mortification and death." "My Godi my God!l he is guilty of wilful and deliberate murder! Agnes!--my poor sister! Why did I countenance this thing?"  "You have nothing to' reproach yourself with, sir; for who would have dreamed that he was such  a scoundrel?"  They placed Clarence. in the carriage and con-  ducted him home with as much speed as was ad- visable.  As they approached his father's house, they were perceived by Love, who had been watching in  agonized suspense for their coming from the time that the letter written by Clarence communicating the fact of the contemplated duel had been placed in her hands.  Her parents were still ignorant of the whole affair. Love, fearing the. worst, yet hoping for the best, had kept the knowledge from them. She hastened  down the stepswith'trembling eagerness; but, when Clarence was lifted from 'the carriage to all appear- ance dead, she fled up the steps and into iher mo- ther's room, screaming, "Papa, mamma, Clarence is dead!" and then sank senseless at their feet. Mr.. and Mrs. Richmond, with faces-' pallid as marble, raised her fromn the floor; and then the   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTMEss..   179 latter turned toward the door. But ere she reached it Jack O'Niel and the surgeon appeared upon the threshold, bearing the body -of her Son in their arms.   . ' "Jack, is he dead?" she cried: oh, tell me that he is not dead!" "He is not dead, dear madam, but-he is danger- ously wounded.  Surely you were prepared for this?" "How should I be prepared? How did he re- ceive this wound-?" said Mrs. Richmond, as she bent over her son, who had been placed upon the bed. "Can it be, Mrs. Richmond, that you have not received a note from --him acquainting you with the fact that he was to fight a duel this morning?" in- quired Jack.  "We received no such communication," answered Mr. Richmond, for his wife. "With whom has he fought?i and for what cause?" "With Neville Heath, sir,-in his sister's cause," answered Jack. "My dear madam," said the surgeon, noticing for the first time the insensible form of Love, and wishing to arouse Mrs. Richmond from the stupor of grief into which she had- fallen, " you can do nothing here that I cannot do better; but your laughter needs your motherly care."   180    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. Mrs. Richmond regarded him with a vacant look for an instant, then again turned her eyes upon the white face of her son. Mr. Richmond and Jack set about restoring the fainting girl, and soon succeeded in so doing. "Mother!" murmured Clarence. This was the first word he had uttered; and his mother's face and eyes relaxed, and she burst into a passion of tears. "Mother!" Again the faint tones fell upon her ear. She restrained the expression of her feelings, and re- i sponded,- ' "What is it, Clare?"            I "Tell Agnes to come to me."  I will go for her at once," said Jack.  "Doctor," inquired Mr. Richmond, "will he die,  think you?"  "Tell us the truth: I can bear it now," said Mrs. Richmond, as the surgeon glanced at her and  hesitated. "He cannot live three days." "Why am I so smitten?" cried the anguished mother. "All are gone, and I am desolate!" "Not all, mamma: you forget papa and me," said Love, who was standing by with tearful eyes.    MAGDALEN THiE ENCIANTRESS.   181 "Forgive me: I know not what I say, my babe, my little Love." She drew Love's head downward until it rested on her bosom. They wept together for a time, then crushed back the tears and were prepared to minis- ter to the dying son and brother, 16     182    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. I CHAPTER XXV.

THRouaH some carelessness on the part of the servant to whom Clarence intrusted the letter for Agnes, it had failed to reach her; and when Jack entered the parlor in search of her he was as- tonished to find her romping merrily with her young brothers and sisters.  "Agnes," he said, "I am inexpressibly shocked! I have always thought you rather cold and unim- pressible, but imagined that you loved Clarence too well to be so heartlessly indifferent to his fate." "What now, Jack?" said Agnes, smiling: "am I to be constantly in a state of anxiety and agita- tion lest Clarence meet with some accident? You have peculiar ideas concerning love and engage- ment. What now?"   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTBESS.   1838 "Poor girl! it is evident that she too is igno- rant," thought Jack. "This is the second time this morning that I have been forced to communicate evil tidings. Forgive me, Agnes," he said, aloud: "I thought you had received a note from Clarence this morning, telling you that he was to fight with Neville Heath; and, as a matter of course, I expected you to. manifest some anxiety concerning the issue of the matter." Agnes had listened with a bewildered expression in her eyes; but, as goon as Jack ceased speaking, she exclaimed, eagerly,- "He is safe, brother, is he not?"Then her face turned white, and she cried, "But why is he not here? He is dead! Oh, Jack, if he is dead, then will I die too i' "Hush, Agnes, hush. He is not dead; but he is badly wounded, and asks for you." 6"Let me go to him; let me go." She threw a lace veil over her head and sprang toward the door. But Jack detained her forcibly, and bade one of his sisters bring Agnes's hat and mantle. When she had donned both, he drew her arm through his and led her from the house. It was with some difficulty that he was enabled to, keep pace with her rapid movements. When they were opposite Mr. Richmond's residence, she snatched   184    MADALEN TWE ECHANTRXSSO. her hand away, fled across the street, up the steps, into Mrs. Richmond's roomi. The scene that presented itself asshe stood in the doorway was not one calculated to reasase her. Clarence's deathke figure was stretched upon the bed, with Mr. Richmotd and the surgeon bending over him, while his mother and sister stood near, weeping. Agnes's eyes. shone with a wild and troubled light for an instant; and then she walked deliberately to the bedside and sat down, saying, quietly,- So he is dead: Jack had no need to deceive me." Clarence, who had been lying with closed eyes, opened them when he heard her voice, and a faint smile swept over his face as he stretched forth his  hands to welcome her. This roused her from the unnatural calm, and, leaning over him; she kissed  his lips.  "So," he said, smiling again, "you give me  voluntarily the caress that yesterday I might have plead for and still have been denied." "Why, Clarence, Jack told me that you were dangerously wounded. But the wound is slight, is it not?"Without waiting for an answer, she went on:-"When I heard that you were wounded, my heart stood still. It beats again, dearest." "Be not deceived, Agnes: I am dangerously wounded. You must be prepared for the worst."   MAGDALEN TMtE -ECHANTRESS.   185 She looked inquiringly at the surgeon. "It is as he says, young lady. These sword-cuts are ugly things; and it were as well for you to be -prepared for the issue, whatever it may be." "Are you dying, Clarence?" she asked, in a low, hushed voice: "you must tell me: should any other, I may go mad." He passed his arm around her, and drew her face downward until her cheek touched his. "I am dying, Agnes; and you will neither go mad nor die, but bear this like a noble-hearted woman.. I do not say that you will forget me and love again: you cannot. You will live and fulfil your mission here, for my sake, dearest, and then---" "I shall come to you." Clarence became delirious after a time, and seemed to suffer intense agony. He raved wildly until about a half-hour before his death, which occurred at one o'clock on the third night after the duel. Mr. Richmond and Love, worn out with almost incessant watching, had forgotten their anxiety in sleep. But his mother and Agnes, faithful and watchful to the last, sat beside him.  When he awakened from the troubled sleep into which he had fallen, his mind was perfectly clear. "Do you suffer, my son?" asked Mrs. Rich- moud. 16*   186    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRISS. "Intensely," he answered; "but I shall not suffer long. Don't cry, mother. You are too good a Christian to question the wisdom and justice of an all-wise God. I might cause you for greater sorrow, should I live to be a' disgrace to you, than to die a good son now. I have been a good 'son, have I not, mother?" "Mother was never blessed with a better, my Clare!"     -  "Thank you: I, could not .be otherwise with so good a mother." .I "Agnes is here.. Would you like to see her?"  "Agnes here? Where, mother?" Agnes, who had withdrawn a little upon his awakening; stepped forward and knelt beside him. "This is more than I dared hope for, Agnes. How long have you watched with mother?" "During your illness, Clarence." '"But how long has that been? You look pale and wearied."             . "Pale, perhaps, but not wearied." "How long, Agnes?"  "Three days and three nights." "And you have been with me all that time?" "It was my right, Clarence."  . "I should be the last to question it, Agnes."  "It was a right,-and, though a mournful one, a pleasure."   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRES&-    187 "Mother, call father and Love, please. I would hear my sister's sweet voice, and receive a kiss -iom each, ere I close my-eyes forever." Their slumbers were: light, and they soon stood beside him. Agnes made a movement as if towith- draw herself from his :embrace to give place to Love, but he would not permit it. "Your place is here, my Agnes," he said, gently. "Sing for me, sister Love, and you too, mother."  Their voices faltered slightly, as they rang sweetly through the death-chamber in a grand old hymn. "I shall soon hear the music of the angels; but it can be scarcely sweeter than your dear voices." He kissed them and dosed his eyes in a gen- tle slumber, from which- he never -wakened on earth.   . Even after Mrs. Richmond had reclosed the eyes that partly opened when the spirit was released, saying, softly, "He is dead!"Agnes did not raise her head from his bosom. Mrs. Richmond, after calling her twice without eliciting a response, lifted her head, half fearing, half hoping that she had not been separated from him she loved so well, even in death. - But it was not so: she had only fainted.   188    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. On the morning of the funeral, Agnes's sister X Mary entered her room to see if she were ready to go, and found, much to her astonishment, that Agnes had substituted full for the half mourning attire she had worn-previous to this time. "Why, Agnes, what will the world say?" "I do not know,'Mary. That Agnes O'Niel is bold, it may be, or that she is right. It matters little to me what is said. I shall give expression to my feelings in my own way." They were joined by Jack, who remarked her cos- tume and evidently approved her course, though he said nothing. When she entered the parlor where the corse of her lover was lying in its coffin, all eyes were turned upon her. Some who had expected to see her overwhelmed with grief were disappointed when she appeared before them with a slow though unfaltering step and calm unmoved demeanor, and thought her mourning-robes an affectation of sorrow; others read in the pale face, that gleamed so white and sad through the mourning-veil; the woe, too deep for tears, that had withered her heart. When the service for the dead was concluded, Mr. Richmond, recognising her as Clarence's widow, stepped forward and led her to the coffin. She threw back her veil and kissed him for the last time, ,nd then returned quietly to Jack.

After leaving Clarence bleeding upon the field, he hastened into Magdalen's presence. "Magdalen," he cried, "you will be the cause of my losing my own soul yet,-if it is not already lost!"- She looked wonderingly upon his pale face, and eagerly questioned hm ,concerning the cause of his agitation.  "Clarence, maddened by the suspicion that I had poisoned Grace--- " "You suspected of having poisoned her?" she interrupted: "I thought I was the accused party." "No one blames you; I am the one. Well, as I said but now, Clarence, maddened by the suspicion that I had poisoned Grace for love of you, sent me a challenge, which I instantly de- clined to accept. Determined to oblige me to   190    MAGaAIBE THE ENCHANTRESS., meet him, he insulted me publicly, striking and branding me as a coward. I was compelled to chal- lenge him. We fought this morning, and I wounded him mortally." Even Magdalen's selfish, heartless nature was touched; and she exclaimed,-- , "Oh, Neville! why did you do this fearful deed? Poor fellow! so young, and so truly noble!" "I know not what devil possessed me, but, after my weapon had entered his right lung, I turned it in the wound. Magdalen, in my own eyes and in the sight of God I am a murderer!" "Do not fear, my husband," said Magdalen, winding her arms about him and endeavoring to soothe him: "you are penitent, and God will for- give you." "I can never forgive myself,-can never forget that I have killed one whom I have ever regarded as a brother. Magdalen, I would to God that I: had died ere I looked upon your face!"He paused for a moment, and continued, less violently, "There will be a strong feeling against me, and I must leave you for a time. Go to Mrs. Rich- mond, after the death of her son, and say to her that if the forfeit of my life could recall that of Clarence I would yield it willingly. Tell her that I dare not ask her forgiveness, but that I implore her pity. That even her mother's heart   -MADALEN THE EN cHANTO SS.   191 can be scarcely so wretched as fiine. Do not forget. Farewell." A few days after Clarence's death, Magdalen called at Mrs. Richmond's. She was doubtful as to the reception she-would meet with 'from the Rich- monds, but she loved her husband too well to hesi- tate in obeying the command he had given her. She was fearful that Mrs. Richmond would refuse to see her if she gave her name; so she bade the servant say to his mistress that a lady wished to see her. When, Mrs. Richmond, upon enter- ing, recognised her visitor, she recoiled shudder- ingly.  "Magdalen, why are you here? I had hoped that I had met you for the last time. Do you come in the radiance of your new-found happiness to mock our misery with hollow words of consola- tion?" "I know you must hate me," said Magdalen, her beautiful eyes filling with tears, "and I am very unhappy. It was my fate to loVe Neville, and, when he became free, I did not reflect that it would look strangely for me to marry him so soon after the death of his wife. And I had neither mother, brother, nor sister to counsel me." Even the grief-bowed mother was not proof against the pleading glance of the tearful eyes that gazed into hers, and answered, gently,-   192    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTNRS. "I do not hate you, Magdalen. It is not your fault, my child, that you are bewilderingly beauti- ful. Neither do I blame Neville for loving you; but I do blame him for marrying Grace while his heart was yours, and f0r murdering Clarence." Mrs. Richmond had grown stern again. "He was self-deceived, believe me. He thought he loved Grace, or he would not have t a-irried her. He had no object to attain by marrying her. As for his--" "Murdering Clarece,'" concluded Mrs. Rich- mond, as Magdalen hesitated: "what have you to urge in justification of that?" "The object of this visit was to convey a mes- sage from him to you. Go to Mrs. Richmond,' he said, 'and say to her that if the forfeit of my life could recall that of Clarence I would yield it wil- lingly. Tell her that I dare not ask her forgiveness, but that I implore her pity. That even her mother's heart can be scarcely so wretched as mine.'!He charged me to tell you this. -What is your an- swer?"          ' "Tell him that it would ill become me-to with- hold my forgiveness if he is truly penitent -" The door was thrown violently open, and Love sprang into the room. "Mamma," she cried, "how can you sit here and listen to her? ,How can you live in her presence?   MAGDALEN THE EBNCANTRESS.   193 She destroys body and soul of all she approaches. How many hearts have you broken, Magdalen? How many deaths have you caused? If the secrets of every household were known, how many of their inmate would call you their:curse?" "Hush, my child! hush!" "I cannot, mother I will not! Do you remem- ber, Magdalen, your wild prophecy of Grace's future life. that we all laughed at as the-ravings of delirium?

"Pardon her, Magdalen," said Mrs. Richmond, rising to attend her visitor to the door: :"he was always a wild, wilful little thing, and our recent bereavement has made her nervous and irritable. Instead of blaming you, she should blame Ne- ville : " "Blame Neville! Poor brother Neville! I pity him, and hate her for making him what he has become,-a murderer. Mother, you do not know her. I never dreamed that a refined woman could disguise herself as a midshipman and follow a naval officer to Norfolk for the purpose of show- ing the depth of her love for him: that she at- tempted such a thing Iknow." "There have been -many false things said of me since I entered so thoughtlessly into this hasty marriage. But I forgive my enemies. Good- bye, Mrs. Richmond; I thank you for your kind reception of one who has been the indirect and unhappy cause of sore trouble to you. Good- bye, Love: you are wont to be just and generous: you will be sorry for your harsh judgment of me at some future time." She dropped her veil over her tear-stained face,   MAGDAtwN THE ENCHANTRESS.    95 and left Mrs. Richmond disposed to pity her while she was vexed with Love. Fool!" muttered Magdalen, as she rode home- ward: "if she values peace and happiness, she would far better have acted differently toward me. I may cross her yet."   196    MAODALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.

IT was as Neville had suspected.  There was much feeling against him, but the duel and its tragic termination ceased, aftee a time, to be the all-absorbing topic of conversation. Magdalen had anticipated much happiness in her new marriage; but she was destined to be bitterly dis- appointed. Neville was continually haunted by the memory of Clarence: a vague fear of death and punishment pursued him as a shadow. Magdalen pergeived that she was gradually losing the influence over his heart that she had once possessed. She noted his growing indifference, and exerted all her power of fascination to retain his love, but without avail. He was changeable as a wayward child. At times he would lavish caresses upon her; again he would reproach her as the cause of misery to himself and all connected with him. Even the deep love with   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    197 which she regarded him became a source of irrita- tion to him. For once the "Enchantress" was at fault. Had she loved him less unselfishy, or even appeared indifferent, she would have had no difficulty in merging his being into hers. As it was, he held the balance of power that would make or mar her hap- piness. She lived in constant dread of losing the love that was of such value in her, eyes, and the re- membrance of Love's wild words did not tend to quiet her fears. She began to comprehend that there was such a thing as punishment for evil-doing, even on earth. "There may be such a thing as retribution," she would say to her child, as he stood beside her and gazed lovingly into her face; "and, if any one has cause to fear, it is I. Your mother, whom you love so dearly, boy, has caused much sorrow and suffering, both heedlessly and heedfully. But, come what will, I shall never be punished by you, my babe. You will ever regard with unwavering love and confidence your only friend. I remember that I read but yesterday-in a curious old book, called the Bible, that you know nothing about, child-that the sins of the parents were visited upon their children. God grant, if there be suffering in store -for you, the burden may be transferred to me, my darling!" These imaginary troubles soon gave place to real ones.

"Neville," she once said to him, "why will you continue this mad career? Have you no pity for yourself?" "None. I deserve no pity." "Have you no pity for me?".; "Magdalen, did you pity Grace?-?-did you pity Kate? Have you ever felt pity for any one?" "But they were nothing to me. I am your wife." "True, you are my wife. As a good wife, my love is your life. Live: I love you. You wish to pro- mote my happiness. I cannot be happy; but I can forget for a time my misery. Surely you, who are the cause of it, will not deny me thus much?"   MAGDALEN THE  SENCANTRESS.   199 i "But you deceive yourself.

"I would be justified, after hearing such language from your lips, in suspecting you of loving not my- self, but my possessions. Once for all, Magdalen, my gold is my own, and I shall use it as I please. Your fortune was larger' than mine. It is gone; but I never questioned you concerning the manner in which it was expended." Magdalen quailed at this home-thrust. "Do not get angry, please. I care not how soon you lose your fortune, so I do not lose your heart. You have ceased to love me, Neville." "None of that! none of that!" he exclaimed, im- patiently, "or you will cause me to lose both my temper and my patience. I thought we were done with all nonsense about love. Love and sentiment may do well enough before marriage, but it is a confounded bore after. Grace never worried me in that way."  He left the room, and his wife sat down and cried, half in grief, half in angry passion.   200  ?MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. * 2 "I will hate him!" she murmured, as her black eyes flashed. "He shall not find me the foolish, love-sick girl to die broken-hearted because of his indifference, as did Grace. I will give all my heart to my child."

I can't help it, papa. I feel sad." "Feel sad! Why, I thought, after receiving the precious letter that heralded the approach of Lionel, you would cast aside youir pensive airs." "Do not laugh at me, papa, I have a presenti- ment that there is more trouble in store for me." "Nonsense!   There are no such things as pre- sentiments in good, commonsense, every-day life. They exist only in the imagination of romantic young ladies in love."' "Laugh as you will; but I am    sure that some- thing will happen to Lionel."    202    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "Pshaw! he will come in a few days, and you will join me in laughter at your foolish fears." "We will see," she said, sadly. "Well, well, it is the especial privilege and hap- piness of lovers to imagine all sorts of dangers and. crosses, and so on. Enjoy yourself. But can't you condescend to leave your dreams for a time and sing for me?" "I cannot leave them," she answered, receiving her guitar from her father, "but I can embody them if you will." "So much the better, Babie. I have a curiosity to know what your dreams are." Mr. Richmond smiled as she swept the strings and called forth a strain of wild melody. "I know what that betokens,-a song of the sea." Near by the surging sea Dwelt Lady Zaire; Blue as the waves her eyes, Sun-bright her hair. Pure as the ocean-foam Was Lady Zaire; Free was her heart from guile As from all care. Soon o'er her summer sky Dark shadows fell, And from-her azure eyes Pearly- drops well. Her love but yestere'en Kiss'd her sweet lip, And, with a sadden'd brow, Sail'd in his ship. *   *   *   *   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.          203 "Maiden, why lingerest thou?" Said Lady Zaire; "My love will come tonight:  Braid thou my hair: Braid it with pearls of price And diamonds bright. Maiden, why turnest thou Cold, and so white?" "Lady! alas for thee! Lord Harold's head Lies low and dreamless now: Thy love is dead!" Down to the surging sea Fled Lady Zaire,- Tearless her gleaming eyes, Unboundher hair. Soon o'er the surging sea Zara's voice rang, As, in wild thrilling tones, Thus Zara sang:- "Low moans the wind, beloved, O'er the bright wave Sighing a requiem Over thy grave. Come o'er the sea, beloved, Come o'er the sea: I am in tears, beloved, Waiting for thee! "Say, dost thou wander, love, 'Mid red coral eaves? Oh, shall I seek thee, love, Under the waves? Come o'er the sea,. beloved, Come o'er the sea: I am in tears, beloved, Waiting for thee!   204     MAGDALEN .THE ENCHANTRESS.  "Nay, I will wait, beloved, Till thou com'st to me: -Hasten, oh, hasten, love;  I wait for thee. Come o'er the sea, beloved, Come o'er the sea:  J  I am in tears, beloved, Waiting for thee."  Lo I as she ceased her song, Mournfully sweet, Her lost love was borne along E'en to her feet. Love had been so absorbed in her song, had so identified Lionel with  Harold and herself with Zaire, that she had not :noted the entrance of a guest,-a gentleman who, after placing his hand over Mr. Richmond's lips; and whispering some- thing in his ear, silently accepted the seat that gentleman vacated.  Love did not immediately turn toward her father; for she feared his laughter .., Wondering a little at his silence, she ase: tjaughninly,- "Well, papa, areo  u chalmned into silence by my Circe song. Is the etitie di-sarted for once?" "Love," said a deep, rich, musical voice, that sept athrill through her heart aad ;thenheld-her spell- bound,-immovable,- almost breathless,--"Love, have you no welo me for me?" When he ceased speaklng, she turned her head slowly, and her eyes dilated as she gazed upon the   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   205  , stranger. She felt as one in a dream until he held out his arms. With a quick movement she sprang forward, and they closed around her. Like a silly little thing, she hid her face on his bosom and began to cry. "Are you sorry, Love," he said, as he turned her face to the light, "that I destroyed your romance and came with life in my heart and health in my cheeks, instead of being washed, by the sad sea-. waves, pale and lifeless to your feet?" She answered his smile with one as bright, as she replied,-  "I can dispense with the romance now, Lionel; but, in future years, it may be that I will change." He laughed. "Saucy as ever, I see. But you will never have cause to regret my safe return to you, my Love, through any act of mine," he concluded, more seriously. "I believe you, Lionel. Your love has been well tried." "And yours, Love." Mr. Richmond signalled his approach by whistling "Love's Young Dream." Thus admonished, Lionel bestowed a quick caress upon Love, and released her. "What do you think of presentiments now, daughter Love?" 18   206    MAGDALEN TIE ENCHANTRESS. "We will., not discuss that interesting sub- ject at this time, if you please, papa," answered Love.       ,. .  "You came upon us unexpectedly," said Mr. Richmond to Lionel.  "Yes, sir. As soon as our, vessel cast anchor I hurried to Washington."  "When will you sail again?" inquired Love, "Never. I intend resigning my commission. Why, I thought I would please you by so doing," he said, in a disappointed tone, as Love patted her foot and pouted her lip. "It has been her lifelong desire to be the bride of a naval officer, that she might be happy by making herself miserable during his absence," laughed Mr. Richmond, "Well, Love, your will is law. Shall I retain or resign my commission?" "Retain it, by all means. I always love you far more deeply while you are away. We will be glad to meet after a parting." "Woman's wiles," he whispered, bending over her. "You wish me to say that, present or absent, I will love you just the same i but I won't" "That Was an unlucky blunder of mine," she answered, laughing, her eyes still downcast. "I have lost my power., "No, no! you little tyrant! You were cunning o     MAGDALUX THB ENCHANTRIBSS.   207 enough to rivet my chains ere you enlightened me."           "    ' "What is that about riveting chains?" asked'Mr. Richmond. "Has the 'Enchantress' fastened her evil eye upon you? She is the only forger of links of gilded iron- wherewith to bind her captives. Once yield you her prisoner, and you will not so easily break from the iron bonds as from the slight cords usually employed for a like purpose by ladies fair." "Quite a highflown speech for you, papa. One would think, to hear you talk, that you speak from experience." "No, no: I was wise, and kept away from her. I would humbly advise you to follow my example, young sir." "Please do not talk of Magdalen, papa. I do not like to think, mucess speak, of her." "Why?" asked Lionel. - "Pardon me," he con- tinued, hastily: "I was carelessly forgetful." "It is not that she has been the cursd of our house that I dislike to mention or hear her men- tioned." "I may then repeat, why?" "Because I always hear her denounced, and I cannot defend her." "I should think not. She is the only woman I have ever hated and despised."   208    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "Strong language, Lionel. What reason have you to hate and despise her?" "None personally, sir; but I am conversant with her impish conduct to others,-friends." You might as well have dispensed with polite- ness, and. used the stronger expression that was on your tongue,-devilish," said Mr. Richmond, smiling. "I pity her," said Love. "She does not deserve pity from any one,-cer- tainly not from you. I know her thoroughly-- better than either of you." "Scarcely," said Love, in a low voice. "But, much as she has caused me to suffer, it is a singular fact that, loathe her as I may when she is absent, I am swayed by her like a lily in the wind when I chance to enter her presence." "Is her happiness sufficient to compensate for the loPs of the respect of the world which she so reck- lessly sacrificed?" "On he contrary, she is utterly wretched. That she loves Neville devotedly I cainot doubt; and he repays her devotion with scorn and contempt. I know this to be so, for this is his course in public. If it be worse in private, God pity her, as I do." "How does she receive such treatment?" "Meekly and uncomplainingly; and no one dares to blame him in her presence." .'.. ,            /'   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    209 "It may be that this is the fire of purification." "It is to be hoped that it is; but I fear not. She is as reckless as of old of the happiness of others, and stops at nothing that will advance her own interests." Mrs. Richmond appeared at the door, and, after warmly welcoming Lionel, led the way to; supper. O        18* j    210    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. CHAPTER   XXIX.

ONI evening, some two months after Lionel's return, he accompanied Love to a large party,-the first she had attended since her brother's death. Lionel lingered near her until he was compelled to withdraw for a time to give place to the numerous gentlemen who circled round her for the purpose of welcoming her again into society. After being thrust from the side of his lady-love, he sought a quiet corner and soon fell into the lover-like occu- pation of dreaming.   He was startled from  his reverie by the appearance of a lady who glided to his side and sank gracefully into the seat he vacated. "Ah, Mr. Percy, you are very cruel to withdraw your animating presence to this secluded nook,"   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    2" she cried, with a bewildering glance of her beautiful eyes. "Good-evening, Mrs. Heath," said Lionel, care- lessly. "You greet your friends very ooldly," she ob- served, reproachfully.  "Pardon tme, madam: I was not aware that you were classed among my friends. You never before condescended to bestow a single smile upon me, if I recollect aright." "Ah, that was when I did not know the noble qualities of heart which you possess. I must ever regard you highly for your disinterested attentions to Charles." "You were not inconsolable for his loss, it seems? "It was not for my own happiness that I entered into this second marriage," she answered, somewhat abashed by his steady glance, "but for the purpose of advancing the interests of my child." "A praiseworthy motive, truly." She detected the irony, but' concluded, to undere stand his words in their literal sense. "I knew you would commend my course." "So it is only for the sake of another that you think well of me?" observed ie ' "Ah," she thought, "he i'Sbecoming interested! I will yet be revenged on Love Richmond; for her   212    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. insolence!" 'I think well of you for your own," she said aloud. "Mrs. Heath, you have been misinformed in re- gard to me." "Oh, no! that were impossible. I can quote the best authority. Captain Clinton's successor (Captain Berry) has but just informed me of your unwavering kindness to my husband." "-Madam, it was not in regard to my conduct toward Captain Clinton wherein you were misin- formed. I believe I acquitted myself during his illness as a friend should." .  - . "You speak in enigmas."     , : "I will give you the key to the enigma:. I am not wealthy.", : "Another enigma," she said, smilingly. "Speak plainly." Magdalen did not like the turn the conversation had taken, still less Lionel's tone. "Madam, I will speak plainly,-so plainly that you cannot even affect to misunderstand my meaning. I was presented to you in company with my friend Captain Clinton. You bestowed all your sweet smiles and bright glances upon the wealthy commandant,- I do not quarrel with you 'on that score: he was worthy the love and admiration of any woman-- while you ignored the presence of the poor subal- tern. Now you court my society. Why the sudden   MAGDALEN THg ENCHANTRESS.    213 change? You say it is because of my friendship to Captain Clinton. I do not believe that to be the motive that actuates you. Some one has played upon your credulity by telling you that I am a man of wealth. As a man of wealth you deem me eligible as a third husband should your present one die. It is useless to waste bewildering smiles and glances upon me, madam. You are not likely to be a widow soon; and,.even if you were, I am en- gaged to a lady a thousand times your superior in graces of person as. well as in graces of mind and heart. You have been both hypocrite and intriguer all your life, and something worse, a gamester and a murderess,--the last in intent, if not in fact. I trust this conference will be our last. I do not wish to be driven to the disagreeable necessity of cutting you. 'A word to the wise.' Madam, I have the honor of bidding you ia very good-evening, and of wishing you no better success, in your next attempt to catch a gold fsh to be salted for future use." With a slight inclination of the head and a con- temptuous smile curving his handsome lips, Lionel. sauntered carelessly away, leaving Magdalen fairly petrified with astonishment and-ager. "That is final," she muttered, as he turned from her. "It is as he says: I can gainnoascendency   -214    MAGDALEN THEB BSOHATrESS over him, if I glance and smile forever. I hate him even more intensely than Henry Calvert." "His remarks were rather scathing, and 'none the less bitter from being in part true," said the mock- ing voice of her mortal enemy,- "How haved I been deceived, Magdalen! In place of reigning first in your love; as I thought, I am placed second in your hate. iYou are very ungrateful to one whostifled the call of conscience and justice to save your white neck from the rude hands of----' "Be silent!" she commanded. "I wish you were dead!" "The hangman. I know it;, but I will not die, even for your sake, glorious one! Do I look like a dying man?" He drew up his commanding form proudly, as he stepped back a pace, that she might note the life that flashed from his black eyes and flushed his handsome face. He laid his hand upon his broad chest -            ' "There is no consumption here, Magdalen, nor heart-disease here! I shall live many years yet, if only to prevent your dying for lack of exciting sen- sations. I am your life, Magdalen!"  "You are my hell!"    '    ' "Shookitig! That is -a naughty word from a lady's lips."     -       -   MAGDALEN THE, ENCHANTRESS,    215 She was released from her tormentor by the ap- proach of her husband. "'Out of the frying-pan into the fire, " sneered Calvert, who could not resist the temptation of a parting shot, "I have always heard that love- matches were the most miserable. Your experience proves the truth of the assertion." "Magdalen,' said Neville, harshy, will you never leave this place?" "I am sure, Neville, that I should be delighted to leave immediately, Charlie, poor boy, is always so grieved to have me leave him, so glad at my return." "Enjoy yourself: I shall be at your service two hours hence." He was intoxicated- to that degree to make him perverse and disagreeable. Indeed, he was generally in that state now land poor Magdalen was in con- stant fear of arousing his anger. She was beginning to feel the punishments Love had assured her would be meted out-to her. For two hours and a half he kept her in those crowded rooms, merely because she had expressed a desire to return to her son. "So, Lionel, you were compelled to fly from the 'Enchantress,' lest she should cast the 'gilded links' of that ' iron- chain' around you? Is it not so?"   216   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. ' eried Love, as Lionel rejoined her after his inter- view with Magdalen. "You forget that I wear a charm that protects me from weird spells," he answered, gayly, laying his hand on his heart. "Talismans are sometimes lost or borne away in the beak of a bird, as is told in an Eastern story. Have a care lest a ittle bird rob you of yours, or, what is more probable, it be wiled from you by Magdalen's eyes." "Woman's wiles!" he cried, gleefully. "But have your will. Magdalen- is fascinating; but she is j not Love. "' The nettle groweth higher Than the violet by its side 1 " "Will you never forget that song?" exclaimed Love, laughing. "  Never "  They were standing alone; and Lionel told Love of his meeting with Magdalen, and related the con- versation that had passed between them. "You were too severe, I think. She has sorrows now: do not add to them," said Love, gently. "But it grows late. Shall we go?" "At your pleasure." "Your pleasure is mine." We will go, then," he said, with a mischievous smile.   MAGDAEN -THB-ENCHANTREBS.    217 "I know what your thought is, air! You are thinking,' if, your pleasure is mine, I:.should have waited until you were disposed-to give the signal of departure." '"You are not going,.Miss Love " queried Willie Calvert, who had caught the last word.- "We were on the point of leaving," answered Lionel. "You must stay to sing one song, Miss Love. Only ne: you will not refuse me?" he pleaded, as i ve made a gesture of negation. "Sing, Love," said Lione. "lit s. my pleasure!" "I must sing in order to sustain my character for consistency, I suppose." "And for the pleasure of your friends," said Willie, as he offered his arm to conduct Love to the piano. "I sing for you, Will. What shall my song be?" This speech savors of coquettishness, but Love meant none, and must stand acquitted of the charge. Willie knew who held her heart in keeping, and answered, playfully,-. "An old romance, an it please your highness." "The beaten track?-the castle and a cot, a noble lord and a lowly maid, a secret marriage and an early death! Is that the old romance?"' "Precisely."  A hush fell upon the assemblage, as Love's sweet 19   218     MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. voice filled the room, which continued unbroken until the last note of the following song ceased its vibrations:- Music, laughter, light, and love, Fill'd castle court and castle grove, And ladies fair their sweet spells wove To win the Lord of Beverly. But all in vain was Beauty's wile, And witching glance, and winning smile, The young Lord Euston to beguile From out his saddened reverie. At length the Lady Geraldine, With haughty step and careless mien, Pass'd through the hall'like royal queen, And paused before Lord Beverly. "My lord, I come from Maud of Clare, To ask thee why thou wilt not share With noble lord and lady fair The mirth that reigns through Beverly." Oh, lady bright," the young lord said, And bow'd with courtly grace his head, "How can I smile when cold and dead Is lying Lady Beverly?" "Now, good my lord, you mock at me," The lady said, right haughtily; "For she who now approaches thee Is surely Lady Beverly." A noble matron, proud and high, Drew near, and, with a wondering eye, Gazed on him, seeking to espy Why he sat there so listlessly.   M'AGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.        219 'My son," said she, " what cause hast thou To make thee wear this clouded brow? Or art thou bound by pious vow To turn thy heart fromrevelry?"V "Oh, mother dear, and lady fair,  I have a secret ye may share,-- A secret that I little care To longer hide so jealously. "Look ye on yonder cottage-light, That gleameth through the dark midnight; Within that cot lies, still and white, My bride, young Lady Beverly." He led them from the castle hall; He led them 'neath the cottage-wall, He softly raised a funeral pall, And said, "'Tie Lady Beverly." The maid was young, and passing fair, With roses in her soft brown hair: But ah I her lovely features wear The calm of death's dark mystery. He knelt beside the lowly bed: The ladies turn'd, with noiseless tread, And left him with his treasured dead And his unweeping agony. Love was forced to break laughingly away from the shower of compliments that greeted her on the conclusion of her song. "Willie," she cried, imploringly, as ", Enoore" flew from lip to lip, "you teased me into this scrape, and you are in honor bound to protect me from the consequences of my folly."   220    MAGDALE - THE ENCHANTRESS* "Will you not favor us with a second song, mademoiselle?" asked a handsome foreigner, with the " air distingug," as he made his way to her side. "I must refuse, even at the risk of appearing un- amiable. I plead, in extenuation of my refusal, the lateness of the hour. You will excuse me, sir?" "I dare not insist, mademoiselle," answered the polite Frenchman. "Thank you; and good-night." Good-night, mademoiselle." He gazed upon her retreating figure admiringly, but when she was joined by Lionel he turned away with a sigh. He had that morning learned beyond a doubt that the handsome young naval officer was the affianced of the charming improvvisatrice. Poor fellow! it was long ere he forgot the beautiful American girl.   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.      221 CHAPTER XXX.

EMBURY. ON the evening appointed for the marriage of Lionel and Love, Jack and Agnes O'Niel sat in the parlor waiting for their sister Mary, a blooming lassie of "sweet sixteen," who must be pardoned for lingering before her toilette-glass a long half-hour after Agnes had pronounced her to be in readiness. This was to be her first appearance in society; and, besides, she was to enact the important r6le of first bridesmaid to Love,-weighty reason that she should feel a little anxiety to appear well, and ample apology for her dilatoriness.    When she glanced at her watch and discovered how late it was, a guilty feeling came over her, and she sprang down 19*   222    MAGDALEN THE EBNCHTRBSS; the stairs at a rate that threatened a total demolish- ment of the weblike over-dress should it chance to come in contact with one of the many projecting tacks or splints caused by the busy hammer or knife of mischievous boyhood.

Mary screamed, and Jack  exclaimed,: impa- tiently,- "If any thing makes me feel like swearing, it is to be kept waiting by a woman "    '  "Yet when Lizzie Elliston once kept you waiS. ing an hour, and you were prevented from fulfilling an engagement in consequence, you smilingly an- swered to her-excuses that you would willingly wait O year, if at the expiration of that period-you should be rewarded for your patience by being pier- mitted to gaze, if for only an instant; upon her trean scendent. loveliness!

Did you make such a nonsensical speech to Lizzie, Jack.? I in- tended to ask you long ago, but her words escaped my memory, and were only recalled by 'your im- patient exclamation." "Don't listen to Lizzie Elliston's nonsense, Molly, or, if politeness commands your attention, forget her words as they leave her lips. However, as she is married now, it is to be supposed that she will be more sensible.. I hope so."- "You have not answered me." "Neither shall I." Thus silenced, Mary held her peace fbr an instant, but soon commenced again, directing her remarks to Agnes.              . "For pity's sake, Ag, leave off your dismal attire on the night of Love's wedding, and perhaps among the gay gallants you will meet one who can, fill the place in your heart left vacant by the death of Cla- rence."  Mary regretted her words as soon as they were spoken, and would have given much had they never passed her lips. Agnes grew faint at her sister's thoughtless speech; but, ere she could reply, Jack's stern voice sounded on Mary's ear in setere rebuke:- "Child, are you utterly heartless? If you are light and frivolous, try to have sufficient, feeling to   224    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. appreciate the thoroughly womanly nature of Ag- nces  "Hush, Jack.  She is not heartless, only heed- less," interrupted Agnes. Then, turning to Mary, she said, gently, "Wait until you have suffered like me,-pray Heaven you never may!-and you will appreciate as I do these sweet lines:- "'Nor would I change my buried love For any heart of living mould. No! for I am a hero's child. I'll hunt my quarry in the wild And still my home this mansion make Of all unheeded and unheeding, And cherish, for my warrior's sake, The flowerf Love liea bleeding." "It's all very well, when one's young and pretty, to cherish such sentiments; but wait until one gets to be an old maid," cried the incorrigible Mary. "'Love beyond the tomb!'    Stuff! Nonsense! There's Lizzie Elliston buried three lovers in as many years, and married a fourth ere the grass had grown on her third lover's grave. No 'sickly sen- timentality' there!"  "Molly, is that really the truth?" "It is a singular fact, but it is a fact, that she was engaged to three gentlemen, who died a few weeks previous to their intended bridal days."

But, be- tween you, I, and the gate-post, (meaning Ag,) you were the 'onidde   fl; fl; for, instead of being jilted by Love^aone, you enjoy the enviable repute- P   226    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. tion among the girls of being the discarded of both Love and Lizzie. Jack O'Niel, you may just 'hang your harp on the willow-tree;' for no girl in this glorious galax of States will listen to the love- songs of a twice-rejected, if she knowit!" Yet many of them marry a thrice-rejected." "Not if they know it." "You and your equally shrewd companions know a great deal concerning others' affairs, I doubt not; but you don't know every thing. I was not rejected by Miss Richmond nor Miss Elliston. I never had the audacity to address the first nor the desire to address the last named." "We are prepared to hear such a declaration from your lips. Of course you would be the last to ac- knowledge the mortifying fact. Take the advice of one who, though young in years, is old in expe- rience, and never be mad enough to tell the lady of your heart's adoration that she is your first and only love, or she will straightway jump at the conclusion that she is your fiftieth, and instantly reject you." "Come, Rattle," said Jack, who was not in the least anxious to provoke her tongue further, "the carriage has been in waiting an hour, and you should have been in attendance on the bride long since." "Please, Agnes," coaxed Mary, "take off that hateful black dress and consent to be Love's brides-   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTBESS.   227 maid. Although it will be a sore trial to resign my post, I will make the sacrifice, and Love will be delighted with the change." Agnes shook her head in a decided negative, and led the way to the carriage. "Love," whispered Lionel, bending over her,. "why do you look so sad on this our marriage-eve? Do you fear to trust your future happiness to my guardianship?" "I do not doubt you, Lionel. My love and con- fidence remain full and entire. You mistake me: I am not exactly sad,-only thoughtful." "Yet there are tears in the eyes that were never known to weep. I can guess the cause of your thoughtfulness. There are mournful memories in your heart of the absent friends who should rejoice with us in our happiness?" "Of Grace, and Kate, and Clarence. Yes." They passed down the stairs into the parlor where the ceremony was to be performed. "How can she so soon forget him?" murmured Agnes, as she looked upon the happy face of Love, from whence the temporary shadow had fled. "But Iam unjust in forgetting that Lionel holds the place in her heart that Clarence held in mine." As she passed through the crowded room to greet the bride with kiss and congratulation, she was the object of various remarks.   228    MAALAIiN  TtB:E CEANTRAEs8*.

Mrs. Ford could form no conception of the pure and beautiful love that filled; the heart of quiet Agnes O'lelhl. -Mary was admired, petted, and 'caressed to her heart's content She was chatting gayly with Willie Calvert in the latter part of the evening, when they were suddenly confronted by Henry OClvert, with whom Mary was unacquainted.,-  - "Miss O'Neil, allow me to present my brother" Mary glanced shyly I:upard the dark; hand- some man, wondering what had c-aused him to seek an introdiction with a giddy young creature like her.

"Thank you a thousand times."   : He placed, her hand within his arm, and led her away for a promenade in the conservatory, gayly   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   229 commending Will to the pleasures of his own thoughts or of the dance. "I am a younger brother, and must submit to being pushed aside by you," responded Willie, laughingly. During the evening, Mary's eyes had been at- tracted more than once to the window near which Henry Calvert was standing, seemingtop prefer his own thoughts to joining any of the gay groups of brilliant ladies and gallant gentlemen that circled round him. She was startled, yet at the same time pleased, that he should pass by acknowledged beles and devote himself to her. She was somewhat awed, too, by the difference in their ages. He noticed 'this, and unbent from his usual haughty bearing, and became almost a boy again. He spoke on such subjects as are peculiarly calculated to please a young maiden,-of flowers, of music, and, as a matter of course, of love. "You will scarcely believe me, Miss O'Neil, when I tell you that I have reached the venerable age of thirty years with heart unwounded by the blind god's shafts." "I cannot disbelieve if you make such an asser- tion," she answered, with a light laugh. "You speak in jest." "And -yet I am  not jesting," he said, more seriously. I " ' 20   230    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "Ah)I but I have heard that you were in love- nay, engaged to the 'Enchantress'-some years since?" "INever in love,--never engaged," he answered, eagerly. "But I will frankly confess that, when I was a simple boy of twenty, I foolishy proposed for her hand, and was laughed at for my pains by a supercilious miss of fifteen, You will believe me?"  l He bent his eyes upon her with an expression in their depths that caused the delicate rose-bloom of her cheek to deepen to a vivid crimson. "Be careful, sir," she said, quickly; assuming an air of offended dignity. "I am still classed with they 'supercilious' misses, being not quite seven- teen." "I crave pardon, madame la princesse! I spoke of one of the lesser lights of the lustrous con- stellation wherein you shine the bright particular star." A quadrille was forming, and they jpined the dancers. "Heavens!  Henry Calvert dancing!" whis- pered Mrs. Ford to Miss Linton, a lady standing near. "It was but yesterday evening that I heard him pronounce dancing a bore. I requested him to tread a measure with Kate; but he coolly de- clined, under the plea that he never danced. He +   MAODALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   231 moves through the figure' witl: unequalled grace and in perfect time. I shall take the young gentle- man totask for refusing to dance with Kate." "I don't blame him," observed Miss Linton's partner.. "Kate Elliston dances shockingly." "You forget that Kate, pbor girl! is slightly lame," said Miss Linton. The young gentleman colored under her re- proachful glance, and answered, "I am sorry I spoke so hastily. I don't particu- larly dislike to dance with Kate; but I prefer to select my partners without Mrs. Ford's inter- ference." "Prove your penitence by dancing the next quadrille with Kate. 'Will you not?" "Certainly, if you desire it." "Thank you." Mary rode homeward in silence, much to Jack's astonishment. Leaning toward her, he exclaimed,- "Why, Molly, where's your tongue?" "Let' me alone. I'm sleepy," was the pettish answer. The little story-teller! She was wide awake, but dreaming sweet dreams of Henry Calvert. His low voice and dark eyes haunted her through that night and many succeeding ones. "Will, have you any particular regard for Miss O'Neil " asked Henry, as he and his brother sat   282    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. alone in their room after their return from Love's wedding. Wilhe was astonished by the abrupt question. "For Molly?, No." "I am glad to hear it. Is there any lady who will have the right to be jealous of any attentions you may think proper to bestow  upon Miss O'Neil?" "What are you driving at, Hal? No." "Good!  Now to the point. I wish you to guard her for me until I can with propriety demand her from her friends." "BYou. are mad You never knew her before to-night." "True. Further, I never loved her before to- night." "And the lady? The disparity of your ages? You are confident!" "She does not hate me. And, if I win her love, what signifies the difference of age?" "Nothing! Command my service in your be- half." "Devote yourself to the lady, but have a care that you do not steal the gem intrusted to your keeping," said Henry, smiling. "Do not fear. My Love-star set to-night" "A man who can pun on his mistress's name on the night of her wedding is not to be trusted."   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   283 "Be at-rest. Another than laughter-loving Molly O'Neil will be my second love,-some sad-eyed lady who smileth not." "I consign my treasure to your keeping. Guard it well. And now to your dreams of the 'sad-eyed lady who smileth not.' " Willie soon slumbered: not so Henry. "How I have wasted my life!" he mused. "What would I not give to feel myself worthy this sweet child-woman who is destined to make, me a better and more useful man! I have an incentive to work now, and work I will. I will commence my new life by discarding my old associates,-gentlemen- gamblers, for the greater part,-and be in reality, as in name, a lawyer, pay my debts of honor and of honesty, gain a name and an independence, and then ask for Mary. Once again I am a man! Thank God!" He rose from his chair with kindling eyes, and walked slowly back and forth through the narrow limits of his room, with a firm step and proud port. When he had once determined the course he would pursue, there was little doubt but he would go bravelyland energetically to work. A few hours had wrought a wondrous change in the man who had shown himself almost demoniacal. 20*   234    MAGDALEN THE KNCHANTRESS. i.  CHAPTER XX XL Whither my heart has gone, there follows my hand, and not elsewhere; For, when the heart goes before, like a lamp, and illumines the pathway, Many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness. "ONGFELLOW. "SISTER Aggie, did Molly ketch a beau?" asked an inquisitive younger brother, as the family sat at the breakfast-table on the morning following the bridal party. "I don't know, Oily. Ask her." "Did you, Molly?" "Why, of course she did," spoke' up a second juvenile busybody. "Her red face tells the tale. Goody!" "Don't triumph in your sister's conquests too soon, Master Richard," said 'Molly. "I didn't ' ketch a beau.'" "Well, if you didn't, you had ought to," said Oily, in a disappointed tone. "You looked so pretty!" "You a'n't up to the signs of the time, 01," said wise Richard, leaning back in his chair, and fixing   MAGDALBN TBI ESCHANTRESS.   235 a penetrating glance upon Molly. "When a girl blushes like Molly did, you may know she has a beau,-especially if she denies it. I am not so green as to take her word. I know she has a beau, and I'll find out who it is: Willie Calvert, may-be!" Mary's face flushed crimson, but she gave a sigh of relief as the young inquisitor turned to his break- fast with a satisfied "That's him!" Agnes glanced at Molly inquiringly; but that young lady was deeply engaged in a whispered con- versation with Olly. "I am glad it is Willie," said Agnes, mentally. "I feared that it might be Henry." The brothers visited Mr. O'Niel's house fre- quently, and Agnes was soon confirmed in her im- pression that her sister preferred Willie. Molly and Willie lingered at the piano, singing duets; Henry and Agnes pondered, hour after hour, over the chess-board. Sometimes Molly would leave the instrument, and, leaning on Agnes's chair, watch the progress of the game. Immediately on the appearance of Molly's bright face beside her sis- ter's, Henry would grow restless, make rash moves, and finally acknowledge himself shamefully beaten and declare his intention of renewing the battle at some future time. Agnes was not blind to these   236     MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. manifestations of emotion on the part of Henry, and became convinced that he loved Mary deeply. "Poor fellow!" she thought, "I pity him. It is no light thing for a man like him to be disappointed in love. He was never a favorite of mine; but I am beginning to have a sincere admiration and high regard for one who will make no attempt to enter the lists as a rival to his brother, to win the woman he loves. Poor fellow!" One evening nearly three months after the events just related, a servant entered the sitting-room where the family were assembled, and, simply saying that Mr. Calvert wished to see the ladies, retired. Agnes, thinking it was Willie, as Henry never came alone, sent Mary to;the parlor with an excuse for her non-appearance: Mary ran lightly down-stairs, warb- ling a popular song. But she stopped in blushing embarrassment as she perceived that it was Henry and not Willie who stepped across the room to meet her. "I thought I should see Willie," she stam- mered. "And are disappointed by seeing Willie's bro- ther?" "You are very welcome." "Why do you not place your hands in mine as you did on another occasion when you made use of those WOidnt ,"'   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    237 She held forth her little hands, and his large though scarce less white ones closed over them. "Welcome me with glance as well as with word. That will do," he continued, as she lifted her eyes and looked into his, her cheeks growing rosier each second. "I have a secret to tell you. Ah! you guess it!" he cried, as her lashes fell quickly over the brown eyes. "You guess how dearly I love you, Mary. Wait! Do not speak yet! I must tell you what I have been, and what I will be ere I ask for your love in return. I have been-I blush to say it to you, Mary-both gambler and fortune-hunter. Your love can make me a high-toned, honorable man. But do not let your generous heart incline you to accept for the, purpose of saving me. Let your answer be what it will, my reformation is com- plete. One moment! I am much older than you, Mary, and am most unworthy; but I love you. Now you may speak." She looked smilingly into his face, murmuring,- Behold me! I am worthy Of thy loving, for i love thee! I am worthy as a king  "Thank you, dearest, for the confidence you repose in me. If I am worthy in your eyes, I will make myself worthy in the eyes of the world, for your sake," he said, leading her to a sofa and seat- ing himself beside her. "1The voice f popular   238     MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. rumor, pronounces you engaged to Will. Permit the gossips to remain under the delusion until you an4 I think proper to undeceive them." "I will be guided by you in this as in all things else," she answered.          - He commenced in detail an account of his sins toward Magdalen; but Mary placed her hand over his lips and declared herself willing to absolve him unconfessed.  On the morning following his engagement with Mary O'Niel, he called to see Magdalen. He arose upon her entrance and greeted her with a respectful courtesy in striking contrast with his olden air of insolent familiarity. She wondered at his changed manner, and waited for him to state the object of his visit. "Mrs. Heath, I come to implore your forgiveness for the cruel and unmanly course pursued by me toward you, and to assure you that you are fully exonerated by the Richmonds from conspiring against the life of the former wife of your husband. They are willing to forget the past, and are most anxious for the re-establishment of kindly feeling with you. I shall, as soon as possible, place in your hands the amount of money extorted 'from you; and I beg, if I can be of service to you at any time, that you will command me." "Whence this sudden change in manner and lan-   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    239 guage, Mr. Calvert? Or do you but mock me by pretending to wish me well?" He told her in a few words of his love for- and engagement with Mary O'Niel. "The engagement," he concluded, "is a secret between the lady, my brother, and myself. It is necessary that the knowledge should be withheld from her family until I establish my character as a man of steady business-habits and as-a gentleman: therefore Willie will play the lover in my stead. Should Jack O'Nidl suspect that I am his sister's betrothed, he would have but to inform his father that I bear the reputation of being a gambler, and Mr. O'Niel would immediately forbid me the plea- sure of seeing his daughter." This confidence was as it were involuntary, and there was a glitter in Magdalen's eyes which caused him to regret having spoken so freely; and her expressions of friendly interest in his happiness did not tend to reassure him. "I acted very foolishy in confiding in Magdalen," mused Henry, as he left her. "She is: not to be trusted. I must see Mr. O'Niel before her ladyship can do so, and let him hear the story from my lips, acquaint him with my plans for the future, and ask his permission to address his daughter. I should have pursued this course in the outset. If he refuse his sanction to the engagement, I must e'en wait    240  ^  MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. until Mary is free to act independently of his will." "Calvert is a fool," muttered Magdalen when left alone. "What could have prompted him to tell me his secret? I shall apply the torture now, and punish him for all the shame and agony he has caused me to suffer. I wish the lady were another than Mary O'Niel, for her father and sister have always treated me kindly, though Agnes had ample cause to hat me. But shall I hesitate to injure my bitterest enemy when he is in my power? INever! never! Ere to-morrow's sun has set, Mr. O'Niel shall know this love-secret. It is generally conceded that a woman cannot bridle her tongue; but I would rather risk a secret with three women than one man: if the ladies find it impossible to keep their own counsel, they at least exercise some discretion in the selection of their confidants." There was a heavy fall in the hall, and a wild scream in a child's voice. Magdalen sprang through the parlor-doorway to behold her little son lying bruised and bleeding on the floor, while her hus- band stood midway on the steps with a pearl-handled penknife in his hand. "How did he fall, Neville?" cried Magdalen, as she vainly endeavored to hush the screaming child. "Keep the young gentleman from destroying   MAGDALEN THB ENCHANTRESS.    24: property, or he will suffer a severer punishment next time," was all the answer he deigi make. Little Charlie had been presented, by I Percy, with the beautiful knife his stepfather held in his hand. As soon as he received it, he seated himself on the steps and proceeded to whittle away at the balusters, and accomplished consider- able mischief in a very short time with the keen blade. While busily engaged in the to him plea. sant employment, he was caught from his seat, dispossessed of the knife, and thrown down the stairway. Neville had always cherished a dislike for the child; but thiswas the first time he had given vent to the feeling by personal violence. The little fellow bore the marks of the cruel treatment re- ceived on this occasion for weeks.  On the following afternoon Magdalen called to see Agnes, and, after chatting for. a half-hour, in- quired for her father. "At your service, Mistress Heath," exclaimed Mr. O'Niel, as he entered her presence. ( You are prompt in responding to my desire to see you, sir; and I will not detain you, but put you in immediate possession of facts that you should know.  Henry Calvert called upon me yesterday and boasted that he, who is known to be an unprin- cipled gambler, had won Molly's consent to marry Q        21   242    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. him and at thb sime tiime feign to be engaged to his brother Willie, lebt Jack, who knows his character, should reveal the knowledge to and join" you in takring meaures to prevent thie mar- riage." "Is that all?"'inquired Mr. O'Niel, coolly, as Magdalen paused. "All? Is it not enough?" "Truly, it is bad enough. But did he say nothing further?"  "Nothing." "The scoundrel! -Why, he told me what pur- ported to be the whole story yesterday. But his statement does notexactly tally withyours, my dear nmadram. He said to me that he had confided the important fact of his clandestine engagement to you; but he said, also, that he had given you a'good and sufficient reason why he wished mte to remain in ignorance. In a word, that he dared not ask of me my dear little Molly until he should: prove himself worthy. He went further, and confessed that he was driven to admit me into hi confident-e from fear that you might- think it yout 'duty to' do so. He wound up by asking my sanction to the 4hugge-. ment, and informied me if I refused it-that :his only alternative was to Wait until MollY 1attained her majority, when he cotiuld choose betwee iis.

"If' you knew what he has caused me to suffer, you would .not blame me for, wishing to see him miserable," cried Magdalen, bursting into tears of mortification and anger. "I do know it, and he has made you all the repa- ration in his power. He has humbled himself as few men would." "The whole world is leagued against me!" she sobbed. "Every one hates me." "Who is to blame, Magdalen? Have you not declared your hatred for the world? Have you not caused- individuals much wretchedness? Believe me, my child, the world is not a bad world ; and it is your own fault if you find in it enemies in place of friends." Magdalen made no- reply, but, with her face con- cealed- i her handkerchief, continued to sob like a grieved child. The kind old gentleman began to grow fidgetty. When Magdalen had wept herself calm and raised   244    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. her head, Agnes sat beside her, but Mr. O'Niel was gone. There was a sound of little pattering feet without; and in a moment little Charlie Clinton ran into the iroom, closely followed by his nurse. -"Papa was coming, and Charhe was. afraid and ran away," said the child, in his baby lisp. "In pity, Magdalen, what is the matter with Charlie?" exclaimed Agnes, as her glance fell on his disfigured face. "His face is scarcely recog- nisable, and one poor little arm is in a sling!" ' "He fell down-stairs yesterday," answered his mother, much embarrassed. "Naughty mamma, to tell a fib!" cried the child, shaking his fihger at her with an expression of grave rebuke, that st oddly on his distorted fea- tures. "Naughty Charlie, to say that mamma tells fibs," exclaimed Agnes, lifting the child to her lap. "But it is a fib, Cousin Aggie," persisted the :child. "Charlie didn't fall.- His ugly -old- papa threw him down-stairs." "Run to Molly, pet, and tell her to give Charlie a cake," said Agnes, anxious, for Magdalen's sake, to stop the little tongue that would tell the truth. "Neville was standing on the steps when Charlie fell," explained Magdalen, "and the poor little   MAGDAtL EN H flESCANTbSW.   245 J   thingdeclares that he did notfall accidentally, and it is impossible to convince him to the contrary.

Molly O'Niel, who has been for six months the happy wife of Henry Calvert, tries to be sober and matronly; but she will forget herself at times and run into the parlor to receive visitors. Her husband, with the several advantages of a superior mind and finished education, added to a determined purpose of succeeding, had advanced rapidly to the front ranks of his' profession. One evening it rained heavily, and Molly stood at the window waiting impatiently for the return of her husband. "Poor Hal! dear Hal!" she mur- mured, softly, as she looked upon the almost de- serted streets; "why can't it stop raining until he comes home? Ah, here he is."        .   MAGDALEN 'THE ENCHANKTRESS.  249 She ran to meet him, and placed her hands in his,-a form of welcome he loved so well. "You have not learned how to be dignified yet, Molly," he said, smiling. "Not yet, not yet! But be patient, and I will be in time as stately as Magdalen." "Poor Magdalen 1" "What new sorrow has fallen upon her?" "She came to me an hour .since and placed five hundred dollars in my care, begging me to remit it to the treasurer of the Georgetown College, whither she had been compelled to send Charlie six months since in order to protect him from her husband's drunken violence. It, seems of the hundred thou- sand dollars of which Magdalen came into posses- sion at Captain Clinton's death but this paltry sum remains to educate and maintain his son. 'We are beggars,' she said, sadly, 'and when two years have passed my child will share our beggary.

"What a misfortune that she married Neville Heath!" *  *   *  *   *   *  *   * The same evening Magdalen, sitting alone in her room, was startled by the sudden entrance of her   250   MAGDALBN TE ENCHIJTTRES. husband, who approached and raised her beautiful hand to his lips. She lifted her magnificent eyes in haughty sur- prise at this unexpected and delicate 4.are^ ' ,. 'I I come to ask a favor of you, Magdalen," he said, retaining her hand. "Thank God, it is not in my power to grant it," she murmured, inwardly. "If it were, I could not refuse.

Any, thing that I can do to serve you I will do willingly." "You have five hundred dollars in your pos- session." "Well?"  "I owe that amount to a gentleman, and it must be paid to-night. You will see the propriety of my remark when I inform you that it is a debt of honor." "I too have a, debt of honor to discharge, Neville."' "You?" "Yes, I.

Recovering herself she mur- mured, WithE a wold of anguish in the low tones,- "Neville, low as yoUi have fallen, I never dreamed   252    MAODALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. that you could utterly forget every manly feeling and demand your wife's wedding-ring and with it payda gaming-debt." She unfastened the pin which confined her collar and gave it to him. "This is of far greater value; but take it and leave me the ring," she said, and passed imme- diately from the room. "Mamma," said Charlie, a few days after, "I wish you would get me a pony." "I can't, my child," she answered, with a heart- pang that she must again deny him a childish pleasure. "I am too poor to make expensive presents." "Oh, I don't ask it as a present: I only want you to fake some of the money my good papa gave me and buy it."  "Who told you, child, that your papa left you money?" questioned Magdalen, in astonishment. "Never mind!" he cried, gleefully. "I do know it, stingy mamma. But give me the pony and you may have all the rest. A minute ago you were poor and I was rich; now I am poor and yjiare rich. I may have the dear little pony?" . Magdalen passed her arm around him andriew him to her bosom.    -       .  "My son, we are both poor, and, worse still, te- pendent on your father for support."   , '1   MAGDALEN T1HB ENCHANTRESS.  253 The child looked incredulous. "Why, where is all the money Dick O'Niel told me about? He said that I would have 'whole heaps' when I was a man." ," You should have had, poor boy; but your papa has spent it." "Oh, well, don't cry about it, mamma," he said, kissing her. "I remember now that Dick told me that his brother Jack said papa had gambled away his fortune long ago, and it would be a miracle if mine did not travel the same road. Then he asked me if I didn't hate the drunken brute. I didn't care much myself about his calling papa a drunken brute, because he really is, you know, mamma. But, little as I am, I rather thought it was an insult to you: so I told Master Dick that I would thrash him if he didn't instantly apologize." Magdalen could not help smiling at the warlike tone of Charlie. He observed the smile, and said, quickly,- "I know, mamma, that he is twice as old and twice as big as me; but I had the right on my side, and I am certain I could have thrashed him. I guess he was, too; for, when the boys began to laugh and cry, 'Pitch in, little bombast!' he swung me upon his shoulder and silenced them by saying,--   254    MAQDALSN HsB :ENOHANTASSo. "He is right, gentlemen, and I beg* is pardons I was a coward, and- he isi a hero," "You say that he swung you upon his shoulder," said Magdalen, smiling again. . The boy's brow reddened; but he answered, stoutly,- "I am small but spunky, mamma." "Don't be that detestable thing, a bully, Charlie."  "A bully, mamma, is another name for coward, Cousin Lionel says. I know that I am not a coward, and of course I can't be a bully." "A quarrelsome, boasting fellow is always a bully, Charlie." "I am not quarrelsome, nanma, and I don't mean to brag; but, if anybody speaks ill of you or any one you like, I am bound to thrash or be thrashed. Has papa spent all the money, manmma?", The bright expression that had been called to Magdalen's fae by her boy's childish prattle faded and gave place to one of intense pain as she answered,- "All, Charlie. We will! be compelled to sell our house, ourcarriage,--every thing." "Are you telling the truth, mamma, or is it only make-believe?"   MAGDAEIN THE EBNCHANTRESS.   255 "You care more for- the money than -for me, Charlie," -said Magdalen, reproachfully. "Mammal H don't mind the: money so much; but it was awfully mean to take the money and knock us around too. Don't cry, please. I am going to be a doctor and. a great man,-Pre- sident, may-be,--and then we will have glorious tikmes.*" "You can go to college but eighteen months longer. You cannot become a ;physician in that space of time." "No: that is so," he said, his brow clouding. "But don't be discouraged," he added, hopefully. "Something will turn up. Or, if I can't do any better, I will work for Dr. Linton, and he will make a doctor of me." "Never fear, little cousin," said a musical voice. "If you wish to become a-physician I will see that 'something turns up.'  Dear, good Cousin Love!" cried the child. "Mamma, I told you so"  "I was an unintentional listener to your domestic dialogue, Magdalen," said Love, "and earnestly crave pardon; But are your circumstances really as bad as you say, or are you merely teasing Charlie, as he suspected?" , "I have no home, Love," she answered, sadly. "And I dare not wsk you to share ours, although   256    MAGDALEN THE ENHAIQTRESS. it would be a pleasure 'to Lionel to entertain you and Charlie for the sake of one who proved the kindest of friends. Such an invitation would be received as an insult to the proud and haughty Magdalen." "If I were that friend's widow, I would not hesi- tate to go to you, I think. As it is, I must be what you have styled me,-' proud and haughty Magdalen."' "I expected this language from your lips, Mag. dalen." "You are the last person who should dream of receiving me into your household, Love." "And yet I would receive you with a warm welcome," "I do not doubt it. You are very kind to forgive the wretched past." "I have forgotten the past, Magdalen. You have .expiated all in the suffering of the few past years." "I would that I could forget! but, alas! it is a haunting memory." "What will you do for a support, Magdalen?" asked Love, anxious to divert her mind from a sub- ject painful to both. "It is needless to expect aught from Neville. Upon you will devolve the duties which he should perform." "I know it, and have determined to seek a main-   MAQ ALEN THE EOCHANTRBSS.   257 tenance by teaching music. Do you think me competent,? t - " ":Amply.

"Do not compliment me, or I shall be spoiled," said Love, gayly. "1Eow can I askthe patronage of those whom I have heretofore deemed beneath me, and who will be rejoiced at my changed circumstances?" "Do not ask any favors of them, Magdalen: they shall come to you. One thing more: if you will accept nothing for yourself from our hands, you will at least allowus to bi as parents to Charlie. We have no son, and-- " "Love,hvte pity!" cred Magdalen, whose eyes grew wild and her heart chill atLove's wnrds. "Do not mistake me, Magdalen.

R       22*   258    MAGDALE THE ENCHENTRESS. ' I cannot, I cannot." "Magdalen, I wound myself in wounding you; but I must say this much: if you have sacrificed your child for your husband, you dare not refuse to permit us to educate him. If you will; he shall repay us when he arrives at man's estate and makes that fortune of which he is so sanguine. Further, if he remains at home an idle boy, his stepfather's influence and' example may cause you to repent having been -too proud to accept our offer. You surely will not madly risk seeing your noble boy a spendthrift, drunkard, and-- " "Spare me, spare me!" gasped Magdalen. "I consent." "My words were cruel, Magdalen; but you coma polled me to use them, and will forgive me at some future time." "I am glad that you used them, Love. I was blind, but am not so now." "Little cousin!" Charlie turned from the window and stepped to Love's side. "Charlie, I give you nine years to complete your education and become a physician." The child gazed into the fair face of his kind friend in much perplexity. He had not heard the low-toned :conversation carried on between the two ladies.   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTESS.   259 "I mean that you shall stay at college nine years longer if you wish.. You will be, at the expiration of that time, seventeen years of age. Do you think you can graduate so young?" "Oh, yes!"'answered the boy, confidently; "I know I can." "Do you like to go to college, Charlie?" To tell the truth, cousin, we little fellows don't have much fun. But never mind; I'll study hard and get on the 'other side,' where the fellows do have jolly times." "-What do you mean by having jolly times?" "Oh, playing tricks on the prefects, taking part in the dramatic representations, hoaxing the visitors, et cetera." "What does 'et cetera' mean?" ' Catching all the unfortunate horses or cows that stray into the grounds, and making them pay for their dinner-the grass they don't get a chance to eat-by takirig all the boys a-riding." "What! all at once? A heavy load!" "Oh, no! only nine or ten at one time. Then the big boys see all the ladies, and, oh, they have jolly times generally." "You will study very hard and be a good boy, Charlie," said Love, more seriously. '4 I promise about the studying, but I don't know as to the goodness: I'll try."   260    MAGDALEN THE BECHANTBEI$S "Don't forget," said Love, rising to go.  U I won't."

As I sit musing here alone, And watch the evening shadows fall, And think upon the years now gone, Like setting sunbeams from the wall, My spirit sinks beneath its woe. KATB Dz FOBEST. A FBW months have passed, and we behold Magdaa len, the once brilliant belle of the gay metropolis, to whom all had bowed in adoration, laboring for the daily bread of herself and husband. Neville Heath had sunk into that disgusting object, a habitual drunkard. One chill November evening she entered her little sitting-room, threw aside bonnet and shawl, and sank wearily into a chair. "I cannot live, evening after evening, week afier week, month after month, year after year, in this loneliness," she murmured, passionately. "If this state of things continue, I shall die. I have lived amid the excitements of social, or rather fashionable, life so long, that it is impossible for me to exist in entire solitude. I must have some companionship   262    MAGDALr T WINCHANT-BSS or some amusement. Ah, why did I not think of this before?" She sprang up with a sudden lighting. of the eye, crossed hastily to an adjoining apartment, and re- turned with a neatly-bound volume, pens, and ink. Seating herself at a small table, she began to write. Glancing over ir shoulder, we follow-the rapid movement of her pen, and read the characters it transcribes:-  November 10.-I must relieve my overburdened heart in some manner. The majority of women find such relief as I seek in tears. I cannot weep, and therefore turn to the favorite amusement of my girlhood,-journalizing. As I glance over these long-neglected pages, this entry meets my eye. It dates back many years .- "As I sat alone to-day, the door of my boudoir flew open, and the sweet face of Annie Linton ap- peared. After discussing last night's ball, and the belles and beaux that formed the. company, our voices sunk into silence. It was broken by Annie, who startled me by exclaiming,-  "Magdalen, although you reign the undisputed belle of Washington and have broken hearts innuq merable, I verily believe you have never had a love. dream!' "' Thinkest thou So, sweet?' I answered, laughing: I have had twen .!   MAGDALEN THE BNVHANTRESS.   268 "'You4 F Why, who ever heard of a belle con- descending to the folly of loving any one but her own sweet self? Are you serious, Magdalen? I believe you are! Then you believe in second love, of course?  "'Ohe question at a time, please! I am-perfectly serious when I assure you that I believe in the twentieth; further, that each succeeding love is truer and purer than the last.' "I knew the heart-history of the fair daughter of my good friend, my only friend, Dr. Linton, and wished to make her feel satisfied with herself if it were possible. She suspected me. "You are laughing at me, Magdalen,' she said, suspiciously.,  ' "'I am not, Annie,' I returned, gravely. 'I am serious.' "My ma nner satisfied her.     -  "'How they, wrong you, Magdalen, when they call you heartless I Perhaps you assume heartless- ness to hide your heart.' "Her careless words made me start with a sharp pain. I controlled myself, and cried, gayly,-". "' What!' "'I mean,' she answered, that it is possible that you love and are not loved again!' "'Barely possible! Ah, I see you think that I am pining away because of Edmund's desertion. *  t   264    MADALEN- THE ENCHANTRESS. That touches my pride. He did not flirt me: on the contrary--' "She did not relishte the turn the conversation had taken, and interrupted me:- "' I do regret, Magdalen, that I loved Charlie ere I met Edmund. He says he would not believe it possible that one could love a second time had he not experienced a first.' "' Nonsense, child! he never loved me,' I assured her. -'I was jesting.' "' Ah, Magdalen, you were his first love!' she answered, almost with tears. 'But there are few girls in Washington whose lovers have not knelt at the feet of "Magdalen the Enchantress!"That's some comfort!  "Misery loves conmpany," you know.' "'You flatter me. If I were in your place, I should persuade myself that he feigned love for my rival for the sake of being in the fashion.' "'A good idea! and one upon which I shall act. Isn't it a little singular that I was not married to Charlie?' she asked, as she drew on her gloves, pre. paratory to leaving. "For a moment I forgot every thing but my great disappointment, and quoted, dreamily,-- "' Whom first we love, you know, We seldom wed. -Time rules s ll, And then we women cannot choose our lot, "   MAGDALEN, THBE ENORHATRESS.  2fi "' That last line is not exactly apropos to my case,' cried Annie. 'But good-bye: I must go.' "O Neville Heath, I think of you with asstrange, wild, tearless[ agony! There may be many deams of love, but there can be butone reality ;-and thou art mine! I cannot, I will not, yield you to that cold, pale girl who claims the title I alone should bear, that of Neville Heath's wife! But he loves me; and she, a frail spring flower at best, shall droop and die when the summer breezes of feigned love give place to the chilling winter winds of un- feigned hate! Be happy in your present, fair lady! the future will be drear!" -Am I happier now, I ask myself, as the neglected wife of a man who is no longer recognised as a gen- tleman by his old associates, than I was as the maiden who was wild with grief at the marriage of her lover? I am tenfold more wretched, I think; but it may be that I cannot realize after so many years the darkness that then shrouded my soul. Then I looked forward to the death of my rival as the means whereby I might attain a lifelong happi- ness. There was a gleam of light amid the dark- ness,-the light of hope: now even that, has faded. I am hopeless.  Thus far I had written when the door opened softly, and my boy, who is permitted to visit me twice each month, peeped slyly in. Knowing that 28   2266   MADALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. he'wished to surprise me, I continued writing. He tiptoed across the room and placed his hands before my eyes' When I sprang up with a cry of affected terror, he laughed-gleefully. Said I that I was hopeless? I erase the word as I clasp him to my heart and hear him talk of future goodness and greatness to which he will attain for my sake. The darkest hour is just before the dawn, 'tis said. Can it be that I am destined to enjoy life once more? I will hope so. My sins have been scarlet; but surely I have been sufficiently punished. At times a vague fear oppresses me that I will have further sorrows,- that I will be punished in my son. Spare me, 0 God, the trial of seeing him that which my husband has become,-'tis that alone I fear,-and all else I will bear meekly. My fears may be idle; I believe they are,-I am so prone to look upon life's dark side. Enough for to-night. Again we refer to the pages of the journal:- December 18.-I must go to-day from house to house to serve those who, in many instances, once served me. I am spared the humiliation of solicit- ing their patronage by those almost angels, Love, Agnes, and Mary; but they cannot protect me from the petty insults to which I am daily subjected. It is impossible for me to submit to these insults in passive silence; and I occasionally resent them in /   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.,   26 language calculated to leave a lasting impression upon those to whom it is addressed. Again:- March 6.-I once thought I could never bow my haughty spirit; but I have discovered that I must bear meekly or be without pupils. Many employ me for the simple and sole reason of retali- ating for injuries, real or fancied, which they charge me with having inflicted. Truly I must have been a demon! I am charged with being the cause of all the hearts that have been broken, all the duels that have been fought, and all the suicides that have occurred in Washington since I was a girl of sixteen.- More terrible still, many are convinced that I poisoned Grace Heath. I escaped narrowly; butI can say, with truth, I am innocent of the crime of murder.   268    MAODAEN THE EWNCHANTRESS. CHAPTER XXXIV. The pilgrim swallow cometh To her forsaken nest; So must the heart that roameth Return to find its rest.-MBs. HALE. NEARLY eleven years have passed, bringing the usual changes. Magdalen Heath resides in the same little cottage, and her condition is much the same, as when we last saw her. Her husband has not amended, but her son is all she could wish. He has grown into a tall handsome youth of twenty-one, and his beauty, added to his blameless character, prepossesses all in his favor. After graduating with the usual collegiate honors, he had, through Lionel's influ- ence, entered the office of a physician of high repu- tation for the purpose of completing his medical studies. One night in February, Magdalen had prepared a dainty supper for Charlie, and sat down with her sewing to wait his coming. A half-hour passed, and he was still absent. She   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   269 threw aside her work and walked to and fro in restless impatience, wondering anxiously why he was so late. She turned toward the door for the purpose of looking out, when it was burst open, and Charlie, his clothes soiled with blood, sprang into the room. "Oh, Charlie! you have been fighting!" cried Magdalen. "Where are you hurt?" "I have not been fighting, mamma, and I am not hurt, but----" "Then you have killed some one!" she cried, wildly. "Oh, God! have I lived through so many years of suffering to see my boy a murderer at last?" "Mamma, mamma, let me tell you all about it," urged Charlie, much alarmed by his mother's man- ner and words. "As I was passing Lamb's, I heard the noise of a scuffle, and, peeping in, saw papa and another man fighting. I tried to push through the crowd to get papa away, but before I reached them the fellow had knocked papa down and was kicking him about the face and head. When I attempted to drag the brute back,-a powerfully- built man, by-the-way,-he turned and struck me a blow that made me stagger. He was about to follow it up with another; but the bystanders inter- fered and took him away. Two or three of the men promised to bring papa home, and I hastened 23*   ! 270   1MADALEN THE ENCHANTRES.      . on to tell you all that had occurred. Papa i v*e badly injured. Here they are." I9   Ndville was shockingly bruised, and it was several weeks ere he was sufficiently recocered to leave his bed. During his illness, Magdalen'seare had been tender and unwearied, and she felt amply repaid when he assured her that he would never drink again. "I have been mad, my Magdalen, for many years," he said. "Fallen and degraded as I was, you have clung to and loved me through all." Her voice was low and sweet aS she bent her head upon his shoulder, murmuring,- "Oh, what was love made for, If 'tis not the same Through joy and through torments, Through glory and shame T 1 know not, I ask not, If guilt's in that heart: I but know that I love thee,  Whatever thou art." There was a long silence, which was broken at length by Magdalen:-- "Do not make any promises of immediate refor- mation, Neville. It is difficult to cast off at once such habits as- " "Do not fear, Magdalen," he interrupted. "I am about to make the customary 'excuse :of drunk- ards; but you will believe me when I say that I have   MAGDALEN THE ENCOANTRESS.   271 drank for the purpose of forgetting many things it was agony to remember. HenceforwardA you shall have no cause to blush for your husband. I was born a gentleman, iad for the remainder of my life shall live one: my dissipated course has made that remnant bref, I fear. I am sadly broken, Mag- dalen." "You are pale and thin now, Neville. I will yet see you in perfect health." He shook his head and sighed, as Magdalen arose to answer a summons at the door. She returned with two small, perfumed note. The first she tossed to her husband; she laid the second, which bore Charlie's address, on the mantel. "Is it possible that we are still recognised in 'polite society'-? I was under the impression that we were 'outside barbarians,'" said Neville, glancing smilingly upward. "We are occasionally complimented with 'cards.' Not often," returned Magdalen. "Do you ever accept?" "No  ' Mr. and Mrs. Heath' invariably regret,' &c."  Their eyes met, and they laughed gayly, merrily. Magdalen made an elaborate curtsey. "I hope you enjoy good health, sir," she said, still laughing. "Such poor health, madam, that I am constrained to bow my acknowledgments sitting," answered   272   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. Neville, with a lowly inclination. "It is at the same time laughable and sad," he continued, more seriously, "that we meet to-night as strangers." Charlie entered at the instant, and his mother gave him the invitation. "It looks strangely like a love-letter, Charlie." "Appearances are often deceptive, Madame Mmre: this is only an invitation to. Mrs. Calverts-Hold! There are a few lines in pencil informing me, in complimentary terms, that the fite is in honor of my departure." The light faded from Magdalen's eyes. "Oh, Charlie, as the time of departure draws near I feel that I cannot let you go." "But you must. I am determined to place you in the position you occupied at the time of my father's death. Wealth is the means needed, and wealth I will have. My profession is a good one, and Dr. Wilson compliments me by saying that I cannot fail of success." "You can succeed here if anywhere." "It will take a long time to make a fortune in Washington." "True. But I will be content with a compe- tency." "You have approved of my determination to seek fortune in a distant country, and I will not consent that you withdraw that approval. Besides, I am   MAGDALEN THE ECHANTBRESS.    27S ambitious of political honors. In Washington the field is far too limited. I could never be content with the petty offices within the gift of my fellow- citizens of the District. I am at higher things,- member, Senator, President. I say, mamma, is supper nearly ready-?"- "Tis but a step from the sublime to the ridicu- ious,'" laughed Magdalen. "There is nothing absurd in a good supper, let me tell you. To a hungry man it is a sight that approximates to the sublime. Don't reply. Instead of discussing the question, we will discuss the sup- per., Where's papa?" "Here," answered the pleasant voice of Neville. Heath.           . "This is true happiness," murmured Magdalen's heart; and her radiant eyes echoed the whisper. 8   - 8  -         b   274    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. CHAPTER XXXV. There's nothing half so sweet in life As love's young dream.-MooaB. "You will go with me to-night, mamma?" coaxed Charlie, with his arm about his mother's waist. "It has been so long since I mingled in society, I fear I should make you blush at my want of ease." "I'll wager ten to one that you will acquit your- self with more high-bred grace than any lady present." "I shall have to offer another excuse. I don't like the idea of placing my homely old face as a foil to enhance the loveliness of the gay young beauties who will grace Mistress Calvert's rooms." "Ah, mamma, I see through' your wiles," he said, slyly. "It has been a long time since any one has complimented you on your beauty---" "Hush, hush," cried his mother, laughing, "and I will oonfess the true reason. I have nothing to wear. It would never do to wear this," (glancing downward to the brown mering dress she wore.)   MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.   275 "Is that your only objection?" "Yes." "Good! That is soon met." He darted out of the room and returned with two dresses that Magdalen had forgotten she posscoscd, -a black velvet and a heavy brocaded silk. "Where did you find these things?" asked Mag- dalen. "PWhere they were to be found." "This," said Magdalen, lifting the brocade, "is rather old-fashioned." "The other is much handsomer." "The most important part of a lady's toilette is wanting,-the etceteras,--collar, sleeves, gloves, shoes, stockings, flowers, feathers, or jewels." "You omitted to mention handkerchief, powder, and paint. I know all about it. I have become a critic in regard to the wearing-apparel of the femi- nine portion of the community within the week. I am prepared to look upon any lady who wears green gloves and a blue bonnet with intense dis- gust. 'Oh, dear!" (raising his hands and clasping them together,) 'Kate, love, I saw Carrie Single- ton on the Avenue a moment since, with such a dear, darling, bewitching little hat, and just the sweetest mantle; but the entire thing was apoiled by--would, you believe it, ate?-oh, dear!-her gloves were a shade too light!' Just the way Net   276    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. Ford went on to Kate this morning. But hurrah for the collar, sleeves, gloves, &c!" , He hurried out of the room again, and, returning almostimmediately, laid several packages on the table. "This is the collar and sleeves. I found them with the dresses, and got Kate to coax Aunt Bell to wash them.: I believe that old woman is going to live forever. Here are the gloves, stockings, and handkerchief: Kate bought them for me. I asked her to lend me her powder and paint; but, hey- day! Mistress Katie pouted her sweet lip and walked out of the room with the tread of an empress. Here are the fowers. We will dispense with the feathers and jewels,-with the former through-choice, with the latter through necessity. We will goiin an hour, mamma." "I cannot go, Charlie: indeed, I cannot go." "Then, I shall stay at home too," he said, decidedly, "We must spend this last evening together."

Your reappearance will create a greater sensation than the debui of a belle of sweet sixteen. Washington will go mad again about - Magdalen the Enchantress."  :"Madam, we should leave such folly to younger women," said  Magdalen, coldly, but instantly added, gently, "Forgive me, Lizzie. I have had much trouble since our girlish days, and it has not tended'to improve a temper naturally inclined to acidity." Even Mrs. Ford, selfish and artificial though she was, seemed touched. "I am very sorry, Magdalen, that I spoke so thoughtlessly."  "Come, mamma," said Charlie, anxious to ter- minate the -interview, -"Mrs. Percy and- /Cousin Aggieoarewaiting impatiently."t They crossed to where Love and Agnes were sitting. Charlie whisperedin Mrs. Percy's ear. "Yes," answered Love,- "She is in the ball- room.: She is too yooung to be present at so large a party; but she rebelled-against my authority, and wse aided in setting it aside by her father." "Ladies, you can come when you please," said Charlie, hastening away. "I must dance the first 'set' with Katie." The first; quadrille was, forming as he entered:the 24   278    MAGDALEB 's BNCRCHANTRESS. ballroom, and many a fair maiden's eyes grew brighter as he approached, but dimmed again as he bowed and passed on to pause at Kate Percy's side. "What does' he see in that, child to cause him to treat the rest of us so indifferently?" murmured a beautiful blte-eyed girl, petulantly. Youth, beauty, and a sweet temper," answered her companion. "Youth! I should think so! A child! Beauty! Bah! She is not half so pretty as-you.' "As yourself, you mean," returned -the girl, coloring. "I am deeply sensible of my homeliness, Nettie. Kate Percy would never have reminded me of my personal defects." "You, are not homely,' Mattie. I think you rather pretty," observed Nettie Ford, carelessly. "Neither would she insult me with such flattery. I know I am ugly---" "Make the most of the knowledge, then," was the cool rejoinder, as the speaker turned away ti' accept the offered arm of a young exquisite whod sported "the buttons" without being entitled to the. honor of wearing them. Charlie Clinton, who deeply felt the disgrace attaching to him through his stepfather, was prou4 and cold to Kate Percy's girlish friends, fearing'. if he were more than distantly courteous, they   MAGDALEN THE ENOHANTRESS.    279 might view his attentions as impertinent and pre. sumptuous. This was one reason why he treated them so cavalierly; but there was still another. He really preferred Kate-who was, as Nettie Ford had said, alm0st a child--to that amiable young lady and others of a similar stamp: therefore he asked her the question others wished to hear:- 'SKate, are you engaged?" "Yes,--to Mr. Calvert," she answered, glancing up to Henry's still handsome face. "But I'll break my engagement and dance with you this time, and let him wait until I can't get any other partner." "I don't care about dancing with you, little jilt," said Henry, patting her cheek. "Ah, Mr. Calvert, don't say that, now. Please, don't say that," she called, coaxingly, as Charlie led her away to join the dancers. "Have we a vis-d-vis, Katie?" "Grace and Mr. Will Calvert. By-the-way, he was a lover of mamma's long ago, and people do say that he has fallen in love with her daughter." "You?" "Nonsense! Grace, of course. And, Charlie, I think that Grace has fallen in love with him." "You do?" "I am sure of it. Hush!" she whispered, warn- ingly, as our old friend Willie Calvert approached with the fair daughter of his first love. Grace   280    MAGDALEN Hb EmNCHANTRESS; Percy was to him not Grae 'Percy, but 'Love Rich- mond,-so striking was the resemblance between mother and daughter when the former was seven- teen. "It is too-bad, Love," laughed Mary, directing her friend's attention to Will and Grace, "that the  romance of your life is to be spoiled by the mar- riage of so constant a lover as Will has been, You no longer reign his heart's empjress, thanks to that little usurper Grace." "Pardon me: I think it completes the romance," returned Love, smiling. "What do you think, Mr. O'Niel?" "As you do, madam," returned Jack O'Niel, who stood near, conversing with Magdalen. His 'heart beat no quicker as his eyes met hers. He did ,iot recognise in matronly Mrs. Percy the laughing girl who, years agone, had taught his heart love's lesson. He loved to picture her as lying still and beautiful, with her hands crossed meekly on her bosom, and her white forehead shaded by a cypress crown, the bride of death.  At eleven o'clock Magdalen: excused herself and returned home. Two hours later, Charlie trod the same road with Kate. "As I leave 'for California in the morning, I may never see you again,-not for two years, cer. tainly." -              :    MAODALEN THE ENCHANTRESS.    281 "I know it," she answered, quietly. 'Egad! you teke it coolly," he said, laughing. "You love me, don't you?'" "' Well, yes,--rather." "Then you should go into the heroics." "I am not an actress." "Yours is a silent sorrow, perhaps?" "A silent sorrow? Yes." "Good-bye, Katie." He made a movement as if to kiss her; but she stepped back and held up her hand. "Good-bye, Charlie." He opened the gate for her, then turned hastily away. Looking back, he saw her standing in the bright moonlight, holding the gate open. He raised his hat in' answer to her parting bow, and, as the gate closed, passed onward, murmuring,- "That slender, grave-eyed child is my star of destiny." 24*   282    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTHSS.

From the date of his sudden reformation, Neville had remained steadfast to his resolution of living a sober man. Still, Magdalen was in constant fear of a relapse into dissipation, and, when he died sincerely penitent, she closed his eyes with a prayer of thanks- giving in her heart and on her lips that God had been so merciful. Magdalen was greatly surprised when many who had disliked her in her days of pride came to her when alone, and, as she thought, almost friendless, and offered her a home. She gratefully declined these kindly invitations, and signified her intention of remaining for a time with Love. Then it was that the lesson Mr. O'Niel had failed to impress upon her many years before awoke in her memory and struck her with its force and truth.   MAGDAALE THE ENCOANTRESS.    283 "Believe me, my child," were his words, "the world is not a bad world; and it is your own fault if you find in it enemies in place of friends;" "He was right," she mused. "We children of earth make or mar our destinies. The evil which I attributed to others was within my own heart. If I had received this knowledge years since, I might have spared myself and,others much unhap- pinese. . We will leave Magdalen safely domiciled with Love, and flit onward to the feet of the fairest of Columbia's radiant daughters, young California. Charhe had fixed upon- San Francisco as the field wherein to labor, and he had been successful beyond his hopes. At twelve o'clock one night he sat alone in his office, thinkitig of his mother and of Kate,--she was still the bright star of his destiny,-when the door was thrown open, and a friend hurried into the room.  "Clinton, there has been a row at Alton's, and a man is shot! Come quick!" Charlie,; catching up his hat and a case of surgical instruments, hastened to the scene of the difficulty. A comrade of the wounded man, who had been supporting his head, stepped back and gave place to Charlie. As the young surgeon kielt beside his patient to probe the wound, avoice outside cried,-   284   .MAGDALEN THE aNCHANTRaS. Shoot low: aim at his heart!" There was a sharp report; and Charlie Clinton staggered to his feet and was caught by his friend, who laid him gently down. A;gain the voice outside was heard:- Great, God, Walters! you have shot the wrong man!" Then all was still. "Lee," gasped Charlie, "I am dying. The mail leaves to-morrow morning. Write to my mother to-night, immediately. Enclose a tress of my hair, and this ring. Tell her to give the ring to Katie. Tell her-Father of mercies, receive my soul!-Mo- ther! Katie! I die! O God--" The words that were to follow died upon his lips, and he sank back, to all appearance dead. Lee Hughes opened a blade of his penknife and severed a tress of the- beautiful hair that shaded Charlie's marble forehead. Commending the corpse to the care of several horror-stricken friends of the deceased, who had been drawn to the place by the report of a fight, Lee hurried away to write and pail the letter, lest it should be too late for the departing steamer. Three days after the steamer arrived at New York, Magdalen received a letter bearing the San Francisco post-mark. "A letter from Charlie, Kate," she observed,   (AeDALN THE MEBICHAEOTBa ESS. 285 breaking the seal y As {Magdalen. unfolde& the pages, -ar ing' well :know'i to: her,: it having theen her engagement-ri'ng froma Captain ,linton, fell to the floor and rblled to Kate Percy's? feet.

' What is. the matter, Magdalen?" asked Love, anxiously, when Magdalen awakened from  the swoon that seemed like death.  The wretched woman gazed vacantly into the sympathizing face bending over her, and wrung her hands and wept. "Is Charlie sick, dear Mrs. Heath?" asked Kate, fearfully. "He is dead! Oh, Love, this is more than I can bear. Sorrows never come singly. Three months ago I had husband and son. Now I am widowed and childless. Once again I am alone in the world, -alone, alone!" She turned her face to the wall and prayed as Grace Heath once prayed: O God! let me die! let me die!" They forbore to question her in regard to the cause of his death; but when she grew more com- posed she handed Kate the letter. The young girl's face was as colorless as Magdalen's as she read:-   286    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "MY DRAR MADAM.:-The blow I am about to inflict upon your heart I would gladly soften, but cannot. Your son is dead. Thirty minutes since, the ball intended for another killed-him.

Kate gave the letter to her mother and passed slowly from the room, murmuring, "Nohope."   MAGDALEN TE ENCHANTRESS     28? CHAPTER XxxvI. Like ghosts are memories of the past eall'd up, To tell my soul God's judgments all are just. A glad young lifoe blighted years agone; I made another childless by my arts: Alas! rm childless now!" THmRE months elapsed, and Magdalen's wild agony for-the loss of her son had subsided into a brooding melancholy. She had heard nothing further from Lee Hughes; but she was too listless to wonder at his silence. One morning, as she sat alone in her room, with her hands lying idly in her lap, a servant brought her a card inscribed with the name of Mr. Dun- nington. "I do not receive visitors, James." "Jist what I telled him, mistress; but he say, frowning, 'Say to Mrs. Heath that I am Catherine Dunnington's cousin, and must see her." The expression of indifference that sat upon Mag-. dalen's face changed to one of intense pain, as she answered,-  "Tell the gentleman that I will not keep him waiting, James."   2j88   MA' BALEN THE EtCANTI S. The servant left the room to deliver the message, and Magdalen turned to the mirror to arrange her disordered hair. Willis Dunnington was prepared to meet the Magdalen of his im*ginati9 -with anger and scorn; but when the pale widow glided into the room in her mourning-robes, looking so sad and s'rrowful, and so beautiful withal, such feelings vanished.

"Lovely widow"! ^ Tears, wiles, witcheries, spells!" were the mental ejaculations indulged in, by sus- picious Willis Duinnngton, who was rapidly losing his self-possession and his heart. "Shortly before her death," he continued; '"she induced her father to promise that, should you ever be reduced to poverty and suffering, of Which. there was little pro- bability at that time, he ,would seek you out and place at your. disposal some: thousands of dollars as an earnest of her entire forgiveness' for a'-for some--Excuse me, madam, I was very young at the time--"           '  "But you have heard much. of iher history and mine; interrupted Magdalen,' gently.

I will not." Her language and manner were firm and unyield- ing, but at the same time gentle and womanly. "Madam, am silent. Good-morning." "You are not offended, sir?" "Madam, from my heart and soul I honor you," he returned, with a low bow. "Instead of good- morning I will say good-bye, as I leave Washington to-morrow."

"If you should change your present purpose and remain in Washington for a time, Mrs. Percy would gladly welcome you for the sake of your cousin Kate, who was the cherished friend of her girl- hood." Suspicion sat enthroned once more. "Iitty oity!" she cried: "you are a fool, Willis Dunnington. Man-traps, my good fellow. She plays sweet and pretty, rejects the forty thousand, and is morally certain of the entire fortune, and yourself to boot. You gudgeon!" Reason read a diffeit lesson:- "Don't flatter yourelf, Willis. You have wealth and beauty; but she wouldn't marry you if you were ten times as rich and twenty times as hand- some." Willis listened to both, but was inclined to side with reason. "I will call upon Mrs. Percy if I remain." "I will insure you a cordial welcome." "Good-morning, Mrs. Heath." "Good-morning, sir." He rode towards his hotel, thininn of Magdalen, while she sat with Love, recounting this singular incident in her eventful history.   292    MAGDALEN THE, ENCHANTRESS.

"Why, Lordy-mighty, Marse Charlie, a'n't you dead?" asked the old woman, who still remained near her mistress, clinging to her dress. "Why, Lordy-mighty, no, Aunt Bell! Shake hands with me: that will test whether I be living or dead." Aunt Bell eyed his outstretched palm somewhat suspiciously, but finally, encouraged by Kate's fear- lessness, leaned over and placed her hand in his. I never felt so queer in all my life," she after- wards declared, -"'case I thought he was a dead and gone ghost, who was8 a-goin' to vanish away with I and Miss Katie on the spot." After shaking -hands with his ghostship, Aunt Bell stepped back, stately and dignified as of old. "What possessed Aunt Bell to carry on so, Katie?" asked Charlie. "Has she turned foolish in her old age? or is she a convert to spiritualism?" "It is natural that she should be agitated by your sudden and unexpected appearance. Three months since we received a letter informing us of your death," (Kate spoke rapidly but quietly,) "and the mistake was never corrected." 26*   294    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANRESS.   . "And nmaTnra?" "The blow .li heavily, anid almost crazed her for a time. I will bring, her to you." She hurried out of the room, and Charlie turned to Aunt Bell. Come here, you dear old creature," he cried, making a dash at-her. "Let me embrace you, and, at the same time, beg your gracious pardon for thinking you a fool." "Go 'long with your nigger nonsense," cried the old woman, indignantly rejecting the proffered caress. "If anybody buys me for a fool, they'll lose their money. 'Deed will they." . Hearing several persons descending the staircase, he ran to meet them, and almost carried his mother into the parlor. The news that the report of Charlie's death had been a horrible mistake spread rapidly through the hou i nd the inmates, white and black, assembled i lparlor or lingered near the threshold to wel- coma him and listen to his explanations. "'To begin at the beginning," he said, "there was a shooting-match at a house near my office, in which a man was shot, and I was summoned to attend him. As I knelt beside him for the purpose of examining the wound, a ball was fired through the window and entered my bosom, inflicting, as I then thought, a mortal wound. Under the imptes-      .   MAGDALBN TBE ENCHANTRESS.   295 sion that I could not possiblysurvive twenty minutes, I requested Lee Hughes -tiwrite to you. He had scarcely promised when I became insensible. He, thinking me dead, huried off to do my bid. ding, and I was conveyed to my lodgings by other friends. Lee returned after a few hours' absence and found me quietly sleeping. The wound proved to be severe, but not dangerously so, and I re- covered rapidly. It was too late to reclaim Lee's letter, and I was compelled to wait until the sailing of the next steamer ere I could inform you of my actual return to life and of my contem- plated return to Washington. My letter, of course, miscarried; and it is little wonder that Aunt Bell was frightened into fits by my ghostly visita- tion." "For how long a period will,you remain with us, Charlie?" inquired Love. f  "I shall sail in two months, madam." "I shall have ample time to get ready," observed Magdalen. "Get ready! For what, mamma?" "I intend to accompany you on your homeward journey," answered his mother. "I will never permit you to leave; me again. Do not advance any argument to dissuade me. My resolution is fixed and unalterable." "I will offer no objection, certainly, mamma."   296    MAGDALEN THE ENCHANTRESS. "And we cannot object," said Love.

She would have broken from him; but he detained her to say,-- "We are sensible folks, Katie." "We may be; yet very few would endorse your last act as a sensible one," she retorted.
