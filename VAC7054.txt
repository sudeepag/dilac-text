Ir presenting to the public the Diary of a Celebrated Burglar and Pickpocket, the Edith' deems it proper to accompany it with a few remarks in relation to the work itself and the authdor Many persons, in reading these highly interesting sketches, have been led to believe that it If the production of some highly imaginative writer, who thus endeavors to pass off upon I e public as realities what only existed in his own brain. This theory has no foundation in few and those who are acquainted with the localities referred to, and the habits and condo, of the individuals engaged in depredating upon society, will recognize at oncthe hand of a fitj. liar spirit, Well posted in all the arts and devices of the fraternity. The writer does not c0*., mence with a sketch of his earlier life but strikes out at once and boldly with an account of * exploits, from the time of his entering upon what is termed, among men of his class, ,' the hi gk walks of the profession." The word thief is, used by people generally as designating the whole class of persons lire prey upon society, and by honest men they are all regarded as equally low and criminal, ^ this fraternity is divided into classes as distinct as in society generally, and the gent/lemt, thief would no sooner associate with a "wipe buzzer" or a sneak thief than a Fifth A ,^A aristocrat would with a scavenger. The writer having risen to a first class thief, ignd# his former existence as time wasted and to be forgotten, and thenceforward his Diary der6W the varying success and failure, the ups and downs of his chequered existence, NotwithstahO4 that he had beome not only a professional but an expert thief; still the lessons taught himrit  his early youth found an abiding place in his heart, and often, in the midst of his criminal cao,} and in his most prosperous moments, the recollection of the pleasures of a life of innose^ and honesty would rise up before him and cause him to sigh for a return of those blissful :': ments. . Although he often resolved (to use his own expressive vernacular) to ': tie up gonn$i ing," yet he never could sum up courage sufficient to break away from his evil companylc;/ When he came to this country his fame as an expert thief had preceded him, and his former:;' sociates soon clustered around him, and he found that he was no more free from their tem'pt e tions here than he was in the old country. For a few years he continued his depredations ufW society, until at last he became conscious of the deep degradation of his profession and the -d,. ger of being separated from his family, whom he tenderly loved, and he determined to reform .ft live an honest life. In this emergency he applied to the Proprietors of the National .^ Gazette, and they, knowing that he possessed good, natural instincts, and being desirous of sidf.'; tim il, carrying into execution his determination to live an honest life, forthwith employed -.x to write a sketch of his life from his Diary. Whoever reads this work for the simple purpose of being amused, will find in it all they coti; desire, but if it serves them'no other purpose they will have obtained but a small part of V*   PREFACE. Lnefit to be derived therefrom. The Biography of any man may be studied with profit, and-es- pecially is this the case when the individual has acted a prominent part in the affairs of life or in his particular profession. It serves to point out the rocks and sand-bars that beset the way of life, and on which the young and inexperienced are in danger of shipwrecking their characters Bad fortunes, while it shows them how others, having been beset by temptations from without and within, succumbed to the lurking foe, and incurred the disgrace and anathemas of their fel- tows or how they rose above the tempter, and, seizing upon the chart of honesty, boldly struck out in life to achieve for themselves, by honorable means, a worldly competency, or a name that would shine above that of their companions. In this autobiography the careful reader will dis- cover that the life of a thief, although filled with exciting incidents, is not, by any means, to be envied. He has no resting-place and no true bosom friend upon whom he can rely in the hour of trial and when such a one is dearer than life itself. The thief is never at ease, not knowing at -hat moment the hands of the officer of justice will be laid upon him and his ill-gotten gains be torn from his grasp. He is a stranger to that peace of mind which makes life joyous and strepgthens hope in the heart. He has a sort of enjoyment or amusement, but it is only when the realities of life are drowned and courage is raised to that of the brute by frequent draughts ,t the intoxicating bowl. He has no associates but the lewd and the infamous; he has no one to l9ve but the debauched and depraved cyprian. Thus it will be seen that the author, while de- picting his daring adventures and hairbreadth escapes, he also shows the dismal prison dungeon, the terrors and debauchery of a thief's life, and the utterly unsatisfactory nature of. the infa- ;pous profession, to satisfy the ordinary longings of the inner man. The Editor may here add that the author is now living in seclusion, secure from the approach of his former companions, and although he is compelled to practice strict economy to keep the wolf from his door, yet he Is comfortable in the bosom of his family and endeavoring to live with at least a conscience void of offence towards his fellow-men.   TIEAVES FROM rTHE DIARY   OF A CELEBRATED BURGLAR AND PICKPOCKET.   CHAPTER I. MB "  AdffWL YOB A7TEND THE DNOASMER BAOES--TH It  LEEDXS A DOSBBNSG ON TH WAY, AND A SUCCESS FULLY WORK THE OIURO!ES--IOW AN OLD LADY WAS RHlEVBD OF HER GOLD--THE ( GONNOPFIS"IN OOUNOIL AT A a 008OS DRtUM"--SIOWING HOW A LIFE OF ORIMD DEsBAE rTS VOTARES. Donoaster races were "coming off," so our " mob" made up their mind to "4nm" down there on the "dip." At this time we used the Bridge House, Boro Road, Bouthwark, as a rendezvous. Here at times were met some three or four 9" mobs" from the country, besides those belonging to this locality, which at this time consisted of Billy Connolly, Peter Gorman, the two Scotoh boys (brothers), Jemmy Glindon, Mat Brittain, and Yacker Jack, etc. Of course the (" pat- ter" was aboiut the affair in Donoaster-who were go- ing and who were not, and a' shifting and making up, and making over again, of" mobs" who were not sa- tisfied with their "* make-up" previous to this muster. Some who were good at 9' stalling" for the " dip" in a "push," were " rung" for others who were used to "fly-dipping," while here and there woula be an "open- ing"' for a few " buttons" in a " chat-pitching mob ;" and the remainder, who were good for nothing else, were engaged as " bludgets" by the u pioking-up- amos.," ," Sugar" was plentiful, and of course the "' lush"r was ditto; but such meetings don't always end as they begin, it being customary to wind up with a general "slog," or at least a private " scrapp." In this instance jealousy was the cause. One of the "guns" who had brought his " moll" with him to show her off before the ' meet," was-engaged for some time along with a few " chums" at the other end of the bar; and not noticing his "judy," where he had left her at coming in among the other "picking-up molls," took a-" granny" at one of the private II lusn" boxes, where he " piped" her anda noted " gun," "lushing" like blazes in their hurry to have it over before they were ' tumbled" to by any ofthe squad. This was enough, for it is considered an unpardon- able crime among the fraternity to " lush" with ano- ther "bloke's moll," especially when done on the quiet. In an instant he was beside them, the glass knooked out of her " duke" and she knocked sprawl- fS   ing and disabled by a kick. The next moment the two "guns"' were into the "I buff," tooth and nail. This was an opening for the others, who were eagerly expecting some one to begin the fun; and in they rushed between the two, some on this side and some on the other, hauling and pulling and pushing until it got to a general row-porter pots, ale glasses and measures being used with the greatest dispatch and almost deadly certainty. This did not last long, astho "cops" soon forced their way in, and those who could, soon made their exit from the bar into the inner part of the house, where they were safe until things were quiet. at the bar, when they again made theirappear- ance and commenced "lushing" as before. While aUll  this was going on the "' molls'" were not idle speota- ' if tors-far from it; theirs were the hands which wielded t and threw the glasses among the combatants, and f well they knew their part, for such affairs were no un- frequenciesto them, " cross molls," as a general thing, being some on the It buff." Next morning, our " mob" being all ready, off we started separately for the steamboat, preferring the round-about way to the chance of being " piped off," and, having all met safely on board the Hull packet, we were steamed off to Yorshire, arriving there late the following day. It being market day, we concluded to give Hull a "' dressing;" but we had not "worked" it long before the " fly-oops" were out in quest ofus, owing to the many " pokes nailed," but we were as "fly" as they, if not more so. We soon " tumbled" it was "wrong," and decided upon "namasing" as the safest "' game ;" so, separately as before (for this is a standing rule), we made on board the packet bound for Selby; at Belby we took the " rattler" for Leeds, which is only twenty miles distant. There being a pretty "fly bloke" in Leeds acting as chief detective, we had cautioned each other as to how we should proceed; and indeed this was neces- sary, for the same "bloke" had "copped" the "mugs" of some of us before this time, while on a similar visit. His name is Mr. Childs, or, as the "guns" and "' cross molls" would have it, Bloody Jimmy Childs- for none of the fraternity loved him. He had as aids two officers, by name Jack Stubbs and Bob Hartley. We had now two days to spare before the Races would "come off," and thought it would be beat to stay   about this ditanse from Doncaster in case we might be "spotted," snd spoiled by some London "cop" nearer to the scene of our intended operation. So 'after a "lush" or two we started for the Boar's :Head Tavern, in Kinkgate, kept by Ned Langthorn. Very few honest people entered this house, as it was :a well known resort of the Leeds "cross," and we knew that, and that it was bad "cocum" to go there; but there is always a longing for like to be with like, andto itwe went. As we entered, the first sight we saw was that of the since celebrated '"Squib Dixon," a tumbler of ale in one hand and a "' bene cross moll" in the other, in the shape of "L Mag Gala- gher"' whom "Squib" was all the time trying to in- duce to " pal in" with him. She was of very little ac- count in the " buzzing"' line then, or indeed at any other time, having "tumbled" quite a "pile" of blokes,"in- attempting to get hold of the "soap.'1 She was very good-looking, and would often " pick up" a "fiat" who would not " stand" the " kid" of Pnore experienced ", molls,', but some how she seldom brought more to light than the usual " tip" a " fiat" "slings." Blasting her bloody eyes for such luck, she would call for the ,"max, and say that was all the flat' had inhis "poke" or "kick;" butthis "-game' did nt " swallow" long, for she was among those who bad tried the same  thing on -themselves before theybeqame what they now were, and they openly ac- 'used her of copping the hard" and leaving the "soft" behind. Still Squib did not care what they said about her, so long as she had a good-looking : "mug," and was willing to-,'doss" with him. He thought that eventually she might; by his teaching, be able to "pull a-poke away," or if not, that she would i ! be handy to earn a " bob" or two, when other things  were "' queer."  On the other side of the room sat the noted Bobby s lutohinson, from Liverpool, who, along with his t 4  moll," was around working the fairs and markets in' i Torkshire. Connected with this " gun's" name is the a origin of the slang term, wire." It originated as fol. I lows: The day following our arrival in Leeds being .a Sunday, the "  guns," in different ,' mobs," set out to 1 : graft the kirks, one" mobf, working theold church ii 'at the foot of Binkgate, and Hutchinson's  , mob "tak- - I 'ng Park street and Upperhead Row for their "I beat.', n After "grafting" was over, we were all assembled i] over our   ', lush" in the Boar's Head, bragging in our h cups-over the adventures of-the past day, when the is office"?vas given that the "cpppers" were " on/" r and knowing that a  good many 'skins" had " come eo offi' that day, we expected that they were after the (t strange " moba," including ourselves, for, what with 1 the "locals" and all the "mobs" from other parts, " you may be certain Leeds got a  severe "dressing" ha that Sunday. -  So, up we started for the back door, ra each trying to get clear before the other, and " namas- he Ing," helter-kelter/ down Boot and Shoe Yard, where stz we had to bring up, as there was no outlet at the end. in   :ht We had hardly time to realize the fix we had run into, p" when the sound of the " coppers ' feoot wa heard in So pursuit, and there being no better way of escape, we r's rushed into an trishman's hovel, kicked out his miser- rn. able substitute for a-window, umped into East Lane, as and so escaped. Not so with Bobby Hutchinson's fe " mob." The "bank-drum" which they rushed 9o into was engaged for the time being by a man-mid- e wife, in the performance of his calling, who imme- st diately upon their entrance " threw up his hand" and ib ordered them out, and, upon their unwillingness to ae " sail" called loudly for assistance, and the " cops', in a- chase being close by at the moment, "collared"Bobby n and his "mob." Of ourse, when theygot to the star ,- tion-house, every " poke" that was " made" that day y was put to their account, and they were locked up, of to hear what the It beak" would say in the morning. Monday morning, when the -case was brought up, fk there appeared in court an elderly- lady, 'who com- if plained of having -lost her -purse on the way from m church. It contained 20 in gold, andseveral-checks. She said she was in the- habit of oarrying it in her e pocket for-safety, preferring to do so rather than to e leave it at home, as she had once been robbed by a servant while in church. She said she could not o swear to any ofrthe prisonersas having robbed her, e but she -was almost sure that the two whom she pointed out were the meh who were walking in front eof her while on her way home from ohurch, They were walking arm in arm, and conversing Z rather loudly- about a young lady acquaintance of o theirs who was just on the point of getting married; e andbeing greatly interested in their conversation, she I did not know how nor when she was robbed, as she   was paying more attention to what they were saying than to anything else. She was certain, from the po- r sition of her pocket, that no person could get to it with  the hand, and thatit must have been abstracted from ' its place by means ofa wire I - The Court believedtho same, and as there was no proof that the prisoners had stolen anything, they were discharged, with a a notice to leave the town within twenty-four hours. This is the true origin of the!olyfaking" term ' wire- ing." Leeds being rather too hot for us to stay any longer just then, we made up our minds to start in the morning for Doncaster and chance it. We arrived in Doncaster that night and putupp at a public house having the sign of the " Quiet Woman." This house is the resort of '* cross coves" of all kinds during-the races. Here are to be found "mobs" of t' hatpitoh. ers," (" oly-fakers," "bursters,?"snyde-pitchers" (" snyde,'" bad money), " picking-up mobs" and their "blokes," ete., etc. On entering the parlor of ,the "cross-drum," faces well- known at other times are hardly recognizable, owing to the clouded state of the room with tobacco smoke. Pots of ale, glasses of hot "   max," broken pipes, and scattered tobacco, strew the tables. Of course upon entering, the usual invitation to " sup"' was given by all to whom we   were known, after which a gallon was called for (ous. tomarvi h Yorkshire) by our " mob.', t vo 'business being in the way that night, hilarity was the order of the evening. A song was called for by old '"Kill-the-Bull," a veteran of the ," twisting" school, which was immediately and uproariously sec- onded. The first call was upon!"Brocky-faced Butty,t" from Manchester, who, after a long and pow. erful"Swig" at the 1 Pmorten" (beer), coughed the looseabks" from his "wizen," and struck out with his favorite chaunt, the "Singing Birds." "Butty" hada pretty good voice for a " cross-cove," and a "I ush- ington" at that. As he was well known to be no- ways backward when solicited to "strike up," he foundplenty of opportunities forpractice. The "Sing- ing Birds" being finished, a tremendous applause fol- lowed, intermixed with shouts of "Encore, encore! Order, gentlemen, and 'Butty' will-favor with an- other.' But "Butty" "couldn't see it" until the persuasive policy of a crowd of "lush" was pre- sented by those sitting by, whieh altered the case materially,and bold "Butty" pitched into the "Rat catcher's Daughter" just as he stood, after which he was " kidded" to finish with the "Smoothing ir-on," and "Moll Flagherty's Drake." After ",Butty" came the turn of several others, who were considered some on the chaunt, but, with the exception of "Yellow Sam," none pleased the company so muchas Inoffen- sive "Butty," the " chat-pitcher" from "Man." Our " mob," feeling that after ajourney from the Lionville (London), a good night's rest was desir- able,- bade good-night, and up we went to our bed- room, where we " fitted-up" our plans for the mor- row. CHAPTER L  THM "SWELL IOBS'9 ATTEND TE 'DONSOTR BAOE-- "OAmT PITOCES". ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR *' PLATS"- - HOW AN OLD GENTLEMAN WAS BELIEVED OF 300- i BECOMES TOO HOT FOB T  HB "OHNOFs8"AND THEY  AVE LN QUICK TIME  Tuesday morning shone in on us with its beantiful I sunlight, and gradually the different beds were vacated by their half sobered occupants, who were about leav- f ing the room for their morning's " chuck " below stairs, I when our attention was attracted by the mild behavior ' of "Joe Elms " a notorious " chat-pitcher " and bullyt  who ran like an enraged bull at, the door, closed and a fastened it, and " planting" himself against it, swore, tl that "ne'er a bugger leaves this "drum" before I get in my bloody "sugar" and whoever has got it had better go turn it up. "We were a little amazed at this sudden J turn of affairs, and knowing "Joe " to be "pretty tall el on the muscle, it none were over anxiou0 to speak first. a At last "Dublin Joe ' another fish of the same water, re Who had shared the bed with Elms, and who thought it th looked rather hard on him, ventured to inquire what it to a1 meat. "This is what it meanu-it means that I ed   as- have been 'barbered' by some one while I was asleep, and every bloody* mag' in my ' kick is ' namased  Ity and left me a complete abhiser ' and before e'er a bug. or ger opens this 'jigger' I mean to have him frisked,' so g" 'turn it uP' whoever has got it, or by heavens some one 'o- will croak'for it." We saw that he meant something ed serious, and one with another we questioned what was w- best to be done, and all eyes seeming to turn towards he! Dublin Joe ' he ' tumbled ' to the ' rachet' and offered dS himself first for the 'frisk,' old Charley Potter, of ruby. ia nosed memory. officiating as ' frisker.' Nothing was h- found upon Joe belonging t11ns, and the like being o- the case with all the others. The beds were next ie searched, and  in the pillow of Elms own ' doss' the 9g ' sugar ' was found- It appears that Joe Elms staid be- ,1- low later than any of those who slept in the same room i did, and of course felt pretty tall by the time he reached a- the sleeping room, where, seeing so many' different e 'schools,' and all upon the 'make-game,' thought it 3- would be ' cocum ' to ' plant' his I stuff' for safety's sake e and choose the pillow as the best place, it being the -' nearest to his 'nut;' but having 'luehed' over and. e above-proof, he had forgotten all about his ' plant,' * and not finding his 'sugar' where he was accustomed to find e it upon awakening, he immediately concluded he had D been-gone over,'  Joe offered a eort of an apology, and r after ' whipping on his togs' marched all hands to the ' counter, where a round or two of ' max' made every. ithing ' a:l sweet' again. After breakfast we strolled into the yard in the rear of - the house, and passed an hour or two looking on at the game called 'maglying.'   This game consists in toss. ing or twinkling in the air twopence or half-penoe. The two-pence or half-pence are placed upon a small flat piece of wood (in this instance the blade of a pock. et comb was used) tail- uppermost, and thrown up in the air with a  twinkling motion, caused by the twist given to the piece of wood, at the time of parting from it; if they fall head uppermost the tosser wins whatever bet there may be on it, if tail appears he loses, if one head and one tail, he tosses over again, and until two of, one kind come [together; as long as he keeps heading them he. retains possession of the ' mags,' While in the yard, a number 3f' cross-blokese arrived from Leeds, and among them several old chums,' 'Tom Kay,' 'Faker Joe,' '   Squib Dixon,' 'Jce Bolton,' 'Newcastle Scotty,' ' Billy Mayfield,' alias ' Pug,' 'Sheffield Chris," Joe Kay,' and ' Scotch Charlie,' et., all intent on ' graft,' One half of the 'cross-blokes' there had ' molls ' along with them, who did their ' graft' in the evening after their 'blokes' had 'cheesed their game for the day, thus bringing double grist to the mill. Joe Kay being more oa the '  bust' game than anything else, had arranged his' tools' along with him to within a   mile or, so of the town, where they were ' planted' in readiness for 'graft,' if anything turned up requiring their use. Being old ' chums,' we had a 'sly' or two together, when, in the course of conversation, he hint- ed that he had a  fine job in wew, and that immediately   sfter"'the races, it woold come off; in fact it would have 'been off' last week, had it not been for the cowardice of a ' pal ' he had lately chimed in with, who refused to cross the roof of the building, four stories high, it being necessary to do so before an entrane could be obtained. Happened to mention my willing- ness to cross twentygof them, if the stake was worth it; and after a little farther converse on the subject, I agreed to return by Leeds to the start, after the races -were over, and join him in the job. By this time Donca' ter began to be pretty much crowded with the peale Koing to the races, and the -different mobs began to move toward the race-course, not that there was any likelihood of anything coming off by the 'dip' so early in the day, but because there was little to take up our attention in the town. Doncaster race course lies about one mile and a half from the town, along the road to which there are booths and small panoramic shows, where the 'yokel molls' ,spend their long saved 'tanner,' for a sight; that is if sh6 is fortunate enough to escape the digits of numberless small fry 'wires, who here make their debut, and crowd the stalls, shows, booths, Etc, hauling away every thing that comes across their 'dukes,' from at bras thimble to a ball of worsted. Before you reach the corner turnming from the road to the'race-course, you may observe several well dressed gentlemanly looking men, cane in hand, walking leisurely towards the course. They do not walk together; oh, no! They each belong to separate mobs of 'chat pitchers' (thimble riggers) and are on the look out for a 'fiat,' whom they intend to I rope in' if he will only stand the 'jolly.' Their mobs have pitched a little farther on, and are playing among themselves I funk' fashion, until they receive the 'office' from the ' picker up' that he is bring- ing a ',flat' along when an immediate opening is made, and the 'flat' is inclosed and surrounded by the 'but- toners,' who, along with the ' picker up' 'kid' the ' flat,' and, as a consequence, 'blews' his ' sugar,' after which he Is ' pratted' outside the mob, and left to reflect on the immutability of human affairs. It certainly is a ludic- rous as well as a painful sight to observe a ' flat' after 'blewing' his 'sugar' at the I chats,' and his expulsion from the mob. He can hardly believe that all the money he so lately possessed is gone from him. Is there not some left in his pocket? and he tries the right. No! Nor in the vest?  No! Nowhere? No! And at times even the hat is looked into, in the extreme hope that some may be found; but it is no use, the I chat pitcher' has skinned him of- every I mag' and, plucking a few stalks of dry grass he stalks sheepishy away, with indeed the ' cud of bitter reflection' in 2 :40 action.      1 Many hundreds of pounds are annually got by' chat a pitchers' at Doncaster Races, notwithstanding all that the 1 'cops' do to prevent it Purther along another mob v are busy trying their hand at tPrick at the Garter.' This E is rather a seedy game, and 'seedy blokes' in general a they are who drive It-' romoneys' I chanters,' padding- ' ken keepers, and low 'fly-my-kites,' who are unable to r   ed pik up a bob' any other way during daylight, although e they go in strong on the 'sneak' when dark, or at the o break of the races, when in the confusion and bustle of ;s departure, a 'tog' or 'spread' is sure to change owners. i C A prettglargenumber being on the grand stand by this ;- time, we sent one of our number to the entrance, with 1; orders to pipe off a sgood poke' and ( office' to us while I we dawdled around, keeping an eye on the 'fungleman' s and a sharp look out at the same time for any start' (London) 'cops' who we knew were sure to be there. As h for country 'skupters' we cared little about them, and e would almost as soon 'graft' under their noses as any- , where else, they being no more than * chuks of wood' ; in comparison to 'start cops.' In a few minutes the e 'office' was given, by raising the 'cady,' and forward we hurried, all meeting in a bunch as one man, and in f time to ' pipe the mug' Ipicking his poke.' In an instant s he was surrounded, and prevented by the front' stalls' ' from advancing from the park, while the rear 'stalls' f pressed sufficiently strong to keep him in the fix wanted. Less than a minute was enough, and the 'office' was 'slung' to,the front 'stalls' that the 'poke' was off, and F to let him I slide i' which WA instantly done, and the flat' moved on not suspecting his logs, Had we taken our tickets of admission before we ' dipped" we could have gone along up to the stand, and, surrounded by our ' stalls,' turned the ' poke' out without being observed; but as it was we all turned back and out of the place, following the ' back! stall' who had re- ' ceived it from the ' wire' and gone into a booth, where having called for some ' lush' we all sat down at one ta- ble, and screened from the gaze of those around, proceeded to inspect the contents of the dummy. (, dummy; poke', 'skin,' and ' bag ' being in general synonimous terms for the article containing the 'sugar). There was over three hundred pounds of it, mostly all in 'soft,' with about half a dozen cards of address, by which we found out that the gentleman we had ' nailed' was all the way from Dublin, Ireland; he having come (as was sup- posed) to see and bet on the Irish horse 'Faugh-a-bal- lagh,' who ran and won that day at Doncaster. We ex- pected there would be a great muss about the ,poke,' and some were for terning up graft' for that day, while others, thinking it was a good beginning and ominous of further good luck, voted acontinuance of 'graft' It be. ing decided in favor of the latter, we 'put the sugar about,' and after another 'lush,' made-again for the grand stand, which was by this time much crowded. We all got our tickets and proceeded up stairs. where we had hardly got seated when we espied Billy Con- nolly and Billy Hughes, from London, in the hands of the Philistines, followed by a large number of'flats,' who were eager to see the 'swell mob' and what would be done to them; for it appears that after the flat' whom we nailed had reached the stand, he * tumbled' to his '  poke,' being blewed,' and immediately gave notice of it to the authorities, and Carroty Charley (since In- spector Charles Langley, who captured Manning, the mu rderer, in Jersey, England) bhppening to arrive just   then, it was put into his hands, and he soon picked out the two Billys, arrested them, had them searched, and finding nothing of the stolen property about them, cau- tioned them and let them go. But that was not enough for us, and you may be sure we did not stay there long after, but made our exit from the stand in 'Temple' time. We thought it rather ' hot' to do any thing in our line that day; so, while the rest of the ' mob' were ' lush- ing.' I sought *ut Joe Kay, and we arranged to start off for Leeds and ' crack' that ' crib' he spoke of. CHAPTER M. THE BROGLABY IN LHEDS -THE ' BWELL MOB"AT A ' COOSS-DRUM"-RETURN OF THE SCOUT, AND H RE- POIT-PELOUk TORNEY OVEB HOUSETOPS-HOW THB BmIBILARY WAS EFFEOTED, AND THR BESULT. The Leeds "fly-cops" being away at the races in quest of some who had a " screw loose," left the ground pretty open and free for us to do our "job." So nOxt day we spent in 4' grannying' the " drum'7 and fixing upon the best mode of entrance. The next and grand affair was to find out where the " sugar" was kept; and forthat purpose one of us entered the store and purchased a few articles, tendering for the same one of the bank notes which fell to my share the day previous at the " nailing" of the Irish swell. As we expected, there was not suffioient change in the till; so the note was carried to the clerk at the desk, who, after examining it, drew from a drawer a sheet-iron c box and returned the change. This gave our " chum" ' a fine opportunity of " grannying" the L" peter," and a noticing where it was returned to, and whether it was i d" heavy" or not, all which was made known upon 1 joining us. (We had taken a third party into partner- ] ship with us, not that we required his help in this in-  stance, but because Joe had previously asked him i to join him in it, and, of course, put him in possession t of the fact.) That night was decided upon for the I "job." So off to Joe's we went to pass the time and get s the "tools" in readiness. About eight o'clook we t sent our third party on to" pipe off" the '" drum," E with instructions to keep out of sight himself, and, ' at the same time, to make certain whether the " pe- ter" was carried out of the store or not by any of the t clerks at looking up time, which is generally about a eight o'clock.                 a During his absence we thought a glass of ale would il do us no harm; so along we went as far as "Ned b Langthorne's, to the Boar's Head4 in Kinkgate, and, M calling for the "lush," we "pratted" ourselves in * the corner as much out ot sight of " cops," should E they come in, as possible. Although the " drum" was a pretty well " skinned" of " cross-blokes,"' owing to w - the races, yet there was no lack of company, such as t it was. Ned's house was a house of call for all kinds; n On the end of one of the drinking tables stood an up- b   t right hand-organ (yclept ," tingalaro") turned by the I swarthy "duke", ofAmost masculine German girl, her *"pal" accompanying on the " thumb-drum" (.tam- i bourine); while in the centre of the floor, long, tall Till Kay (sister to the notorious Tom Kay), the flash- iest '" moll" in Leeds, danced to the (music i) tune of the Liverpool hornpipe, relieved, now and then, by the "( knuck", Joe Bolton, and his " nuttiest" lady, Fanny Archer, who took the floor by turns. Joe Bel. ton was only beginning his career as a "'knuck" at the time. Had he known much, he would have been at the races with a " mob" of his own; but as it was, he was obliged to depend upon a "t trick" or two on the market days, or a chance " dip'y in the auction stores; or if both failed, he could ( whisper" a "bob" or two from some of the " molls"' until such time as a "poke" came off, when all would be " blowed" along with his favorite II chums," the Kinkgatestreet walk- ers. Joe's " rig" at this time was enough to keep him out of any respectable ,' gonnoff mob ;" and however he escaped so long seemed rOemaiw bly wonderful to us " guns" from the " start," who are obliged to dress in almost every style in order to avoid detection. I will give a description of said " oross-cove" as he ap- peared on that occasion. Height, about five feet fivo or six inches; face ruddy, oyes black as sloe; nose wide and flattish at end; mouth extremely large, with Congo lips; hair dark and turned in at sides, a ltc "Newgate knockers." Dress, moleskin sleove-jacket, pockets outside, with flaps; unlimitedquantum suffcit of mother-of-pearl buttons on breast and flaps; black velveteen trowsers, tight at knee immensely wide at bottoms, with six buttons at each bottom, and a slit to correspond; crimson colored " ogle" round the neck, a la Byron; colored cotton shirt; fur cap, a la Bendigo; and a pair of light wooden clogs, ornament- ed with brass hearts, stars, diamonds, etc. This style is considered ' flash" among the Yorkshire aspirants to u gunology,"' who pass the most of their time in the market place, or dance their time away with low street-walkers in "lush drums," as in Ned Lang- thorne's, Bolton was doing with flash Till Kay and Fanny Archer and others. (Squire and others of the Williamburgh school cannot btt recognize the truth- fulness of this description.) in Leeds, the floors of the "lush drums" are thickly sanded, and when half a dozen such, dressed as described, have danced for any length of time, flip-flapping among the sand, rais- ing a cloud worse than a grist-mill, it can easily be believed we were anxious for the return of our scout. About tenfo'clock he came and reported proceedings. He had watched, he said, until he got tired, and was about returning to us with the belief that the clerk, or whoever it was that remained in the store, meant to stay there all night, when he thought he would draw near and listen if anything was going on. Everything being shut up outside, there was little chance of being   observed " ear-wigging.-"So he got on to the space that lay between the outer shop. door and inner glass door, where, after listening awhile, he distinctly heard the chink of I' sugar," and he resolved to stay it out another hour or two; buthe had very little longerto stay, for in a few minutes the light was turned off, a man came out, locked and pad-locked the door outside, and after overhauling the window-shutters, etc., walked away. In the dark he was not certain whether the cash-box was brought away or not, especially as the man wore a short cloak, and, for all he knew, might have it under his arm, and covered by the cloak. So to set that at rest, he headed him off by going round another street; and just as the person got near enough to a lamp, he asked him respectfully to tell him what o'clock it was. This succeeded, and while the gentle- man was examining his watch by the light of the lamp, he had a full opportunity of knowing that the " peter"' was left inthe "drum," and off he started to inform us of the event of his mission, and found us, anxiously awaiting his coming. We called for a measure o ale, and while those around were engaged helping each other, we contrived to slip out separately. Joe Kay, the principal in this affair, thought that, having to en- ter the " drum," he would have his share to do, and that it would be no more than right that some one else should (" swag" the " tools;" and our scout being the last, took into the "job," it was agreed that he should do the " swagging." I was very glad of this arrangement, for, of all nasty and uncomfortable par- ceels, I think a set of housebreaker's tools the worst to be lugging along any time, and more especially at "or 12 o'clock p. M. I had heardof many at "cross- cove" pinched" on his way to the "job," and the "'tools" being found on him, for which he thought himself very lucky to get off with a "( drag" (three months in ' esturbin.") So I very willingly seconde d Joe's motion, and the " tools" were given to the scout, with directions where to go and how to get there. From the first, I had little confidence in our third party, not only from wat I observed of him myself but from how I heard him, spokeq of by others, and also from the very significant circumstances of Joe being obliged to let him into the "job," and therefore I was determined to keep my weather eye open. We looked around for some time before we had an oppor- tunity of trying what the " screws" could do at the front, and finding that it would be no " bottle" there without " bursting" it, we gave up the notion of an entrance that way, for this reason: The policemen passed there every few minutes, and examined the doors as they passed, and had we been obliged to en ter by the front door, the marks made by us would have been observed, very probably, before we had finished the "job," and so have led to our detection. There was a private passage-way into the back yard, the door of which was securely fastened inside, and, for the same reason as above, we dare not try that. The only other means of gaining an entrance was by C   eT going round to the rear of the buiding, where were s some stables. From the roof of these wecould climb t d up on to a still higher, and so on until we reachedI Lt the roof ofthe building we wanted to enter. It was o getting pretty late, so we set to work. We posted our a scout where we thought he was mostusefulin case of i, an alarm, with instructions what to do under the cir. , cumstances, and taking a couple of "jimmeys, some "r "screws," and a stout rope, Joe,and I proceeded on our dangerous travel. Our progress was but slow, t owing to the difficulties we had to surmount, in the o shape of climbing, and the fear we had of loose slates d running off with our foothold. After crossing three i housetops, we were brought to a stand-still by a very tt high stalk of chimneys; this, we must get over, if we meant bringing away the " stuff;" so I volunteered to go back, and with the scout's assistance, bring along a short ladder we noticed lying on the stable roof. When I got to the place where wehad left our look- out, lo I and behold, he was non est, he was a a na- maser." I had thought as much, but having gone so far, it was no use to give it up so; besides, my"pal" was waiting for my return, so I managed to bring along the ladder myself, but I had great difficulty in so doing, and ran amomentary risk of overbalancing, and being dashed to pieces-on the flag stones beneath. At last I reached him, and there acquainted him with the cowardice of our unfaithful " pal." Joe was not much of a swearer, but all he knew in that line steamed off just then at an amazing rate. "Blast his bloody eyes, the ' cross-tailed bugger,' to 'namase,' and leave us in 'this bloody fix; not a bloody ' mag' shall he ' kick' out of this 'job,' or I'm buggered; but, never mind, we can get along with- out the bastard; lets lift the ladder." The ladder was placed against the ohimney-stack, and by it we got to the, roof; but here an aooident occurred, whioh looked like spoiling the night's ven- ture. As we got on the roof, a portion -of the plas- ter around the chimnney-pot was displaced, and the pot, having insufficient hold ofthe stack, toppled over, and, with a crash, fell into the yard below! I Here was a fix! What were we to do? We were near on the topple ourselves, on the ridge of the roof, so, in a whisper, we made up our minds to slide along, and " plant" ourselves somewhere farther along, un- til the coast was clear. I must own that housebreak- ing and its concomitants had no charms for me at that moment, perched four stories high, on the peak of a roof. I wished myself in Doncaster, or anywhere else, but where I was. "Buzzing" at that- moment was high in the market, while " cracking" appeared to me considerably below par. We had hardly se- creted ourself behind another set of chimneys, when a light appeared in the yard, and a voice from a win- dow beneath us, called out: , What is the matter, William?" "Why ma'am, one of them ere pots has tumbled'  over again. I thought they would, cause of the lime   coming off in the yard the other day. They don't half fix them-them fellows what did it last.*' "' Well, you must see to itin the mhorning, William, and have it replaced, and all fixed properly. One is m danger of their life while they remain as they are." We pinched each other at the satisfactory finale to this rather ugly tumble (of the pot), and lay quiet for another hour, during which I made many inward re- solves unfavorable to this method of living high in the world. , When all was quiet, we again made for the place of entry, and having reached a ciraular skylight, pre- pared to enter. Neither of us seemed anxious to be first to enter; and, I fancy, Joe noticed this, as well as myself, when, throwing aside all fear, he burst open the skylight, and fastening the rope around his body, told me to do the same, and he would go first. I fastened the other end around my waist, and Joe descended while I lay across the opening with the rope attached to my body. I shall never forget that hour. Joe had lowered himself as far as the rope would allow, and yet he could get nowhere to stand, and what with his weight and the unnatural position I was in, I felt as if I was about being out in two. I called to him as loud as I dared to, and received for answer that he was dangling in a well, or something like it. A thought struck me how things stood; and extending myself to the utmost, I called upon him to swing himself to either side and obtain a footing, if it was only for a moment, for I was nearly cut asunder. He did so, and fortunately planted his foot upon a bannister, and after a moment or two unhitched him- self. What a God-send this was for me! I tried to stand erect; but no, I was as crooked as a bed-key- a perfect fac-simile of a stage contortionist. Fare- well forever, I thought-farewell forever to!" burst. ing," "cracking, or whatever they chose to call it. Henceforth the " dip," exclusive of all others, shall be my " game."  The next affair was, how was I to got down. I did hot like the operation, but there was danger either way-by returning or going forward-so I chose the forward track, and with Joe's assistance and the aid of a large clothes-horse he found inside, I succeeded in reaching where he-stood, leavingthe rope tied to a fastening of the skylight frame. Having struck a  light, we descended to the shop, carefully broke open the desk, and there found our eagerly sought-after reward.  Joe "collared' the , "peter," and hastily breaking it open, counted over 250, in paper and coin. We shared it there between the two of us, and never was money harder earned- . and so we thought. As for the ,' shiser" who left us 1 we caredlittle about him for both of us intended to f be on our way for London before he would hear of it. I The next affair was to getsafely out, which we did by  opening a back window of the store, entering the yard i and forcing open the door of the passage-way, and by v tn; OOad=An  O ^  Llt  rh    o ^rkr  a   t wagons coming along, we joined them, and so arrived at Joe's house. After shifting ourselves as wo needed, , we immediately took the early train for London, and s arrived safely in the " start." T CAPTER VI. THE "AWEL IOB"BOISIT THE t' LUESH DRUM"OS THE WEO" MNSTEB  DOCTOR'-A FREEB FIGHT AONG THK GON- NOFFS"-  VISIT TO THE "SEVEN DIALS"-A OaoKNEY BREAKFAST. Joe and I arrived in London all safe, and calling for a cab, told the driver to take us to the American Hotel, Trafalgar Square, nsually called Morley's Hotel, where, tafter a sociable chat over a bottle of wine, we agreed to visit the '" drums" in and around London. The first p'ace we proposed calling at was the famous Bridge House, Borough Road, Southwark. and to it we went in a cab. When we entered, the place in front of the bar was pretty well filled with those who were unable to leave for Doncaster Races, and also a sprinkling of the re- turned " guns" who had made their stake on the first day of the Races. We had not been many hours there before others belonging to our "school" arrived,and among them my own mob. Of eourse I expected a rkaceting" upon meeting them, and was prepared for it: but poor Joe, had to stand the "t racket ' more so than myself, he being blamed for " kiddingu' me away from them. In the midst of the row Tommy Stevens and his ,' moil"Mag came in, and he being a little ' scavoir" undertook to defend me in what I had done. This brou ghit on a quarrel between him and my "stalls" and another Bridge House general row was the result. Tommy had friends around that quarter, and some of them in the honse at the time; and soon as the scrape began, blows fioln unexpected quar- ters fell thick and heavy around. While this was going on, Joe and I were watchng an opportunity to " na- mase" from the " drum"  and we succceded in doing so, and again separated to meet on Tower Hill at half past 9 P M. ready for our night adventure. As Joe wished to see the eights and visit the 'flash houses,;" we agreed to take a look in at the "Doctor'ae then keepings a lush drum" in the Blackfriar's road, op- posito the Magdalene Asylum. 'In England he is known by the cognomen of the " Westminister Doctor," Ilis proper name is William Winterflood. He originially hailed from Pye street, Westminster, where, along with George Bull, Steppy, Harry Bryan, Martin Fitz, John- ny Lloyd, Tom Sales, and others of that school, they were the terror of the neighborhood. The Doctor had been having somo difficulty with the police authorities about this time, and a watch was kept by thelm on his house, and t]ey were ordered to visit it and notice who frequented it, This did not suit the "Doc," as it drove many of his customers away,and he resolved to be even with them. So to work he went and fetced his place in front with but one entrance to the house, and that was secured by a contrivance which allowed no one to anter but those whom he wished to. He had a  strong   lock upon the gate, and when y one whom he pleased to admit rang the bell, "Doo" would touch a secret spring hidden under the counter, and the door would By open I but if a " cop" or any suspicions person wanted to enter, it was no go. Then Doctor was "palled in"' wit a " moll" named. ' Brumagin Pol,', who was up to snufl somewhat, Doe. " kidded" her away from her a bloke" in Westminster, and after living with him she, upon his getting settled A" palled in';.with Baxnash, the Westmi ster " scrapper bloke." Barney, it appeared, had been on very familiar terms with Poll while she lived in Westminster, previous to "Doe." getting her, and "Doc t."knew this; therefore on this occasion he determined to L" pipe off' as to how they would act, without appearing to notice it As we got to the door Barnash drove up in a gig, and entered at the same time with us. He was pretty well 'maxed," and ordered halt a dozen bottles of wine for the com- pany. While this was being punished, in came Harry Bryant, alias Legs, formerly of Westminster, and one ef Barney's old chums. Legs had, in company with Lloyd and George Bull, been doing a crib the night previous, but on " raking the stuff, stuck" to some eighty pounds. The others found it out, and were eagerly waiting for him to come in; so, upon his entrance, he was accused of sinking the eighty " quid," and asked to 'square it.', He denied having "hided', anything, and a fight ensued in which Legs got dreadfully used up. No one seemed to take his part, with the exception of Barnash, because of his well known habit of cheating his "pals." While the fight was going on, Barney interfered in behalf of Bryant, and offered to fight any man in the house. Doctor having a " derry" on him, on account of his previous intimacy with his 'moll' accepted the challenge, and they prepared for the fight. Upon strip. ping Doctor proposed fighting with knives, or any oth. er bloody thing, and it was agreed' to by Barnash. Doe. immediately stepped up to the bar and ordered Brummey to give him the knife-tray, Whenlhe saw that Barnrash meant fighting he began to quake a little, and would have backed out could he have done so any way de- cently; but Barney would have fight, so Doctor throws the knife-tray on the floor, telling Barney to take his a choice. They were the usual table knives, so Barney E ",collars" the first that came tohis hand, and took a posi- i tion; but what was his and ounr astonishment to see Doc- . tor draw from under his waisthand a long-bladed car. i ving knife! He had "' planted" it there while at the bar. e Of course the fight came to an end on such unequal I standing-the very thing the Doctor wanted, and more i drinks were called. Lloyd was tried at the Old Bailey, along with Tom- . my Sales, for the murder of Mr. Bellchambers. Lloyd t got "  turned up," but Sale was convicted and executed  Having seen enough of the "Doctor's" for one day we I took our leave and were driven over to the Seven Dials, t another famous "  meet' forWest-end ," guns," where we i met with Tom innivan, One-eyed Jack Ettn, Jin Gut. t / .   d  ail, Jerry Scanlon, et  Before leaving the Diabl. we et made an appointment with ittle Jack'Fisher to meet him My across the water at a house in Charles street, Westmin- to ster-roads, called the "Crown and Anchbr."' So after th au hour or so, we jumped into a cab, and over we were iff n fifteen minutes. HavingS' slung" cabby his " pewter', for the ride, in we went to the!"Crown and Anchor." is Seated in the bar-parlor were some six or eight " guns" 1 who had seceded from the regular I meet" house on both sides of the water, and had met and formed new mobs. to These were Charley Hicks, who had left the Bridge e House, Borough Road; Charley the Flat (no flat either) who had left the same place; George Whittaker alias eSnags the " wire" who left the "'star" with Bill Frenohy, I (soon afterwards "boated" for a " dummy" on Westmin ster Bridge) and little Jack Fisher, alias Cabby Fisher, ' This was the party whom  we were to meet. After a Y drink Fisher " slung the office," and we followed him e out into the skittle-ground, where he informed us of the I particulars ot a " put up job" he had on hand, and how t much it was likely to bring in. His regular " pal" was lying sick at home, and he being almost a " skinner" in V the " sugar" line, could wait no longer. It was to be a sure thing, as he had the screws already fitted. This was all in Joe's line, and although I had made I up my mind while on the house-top in the Leeds affair * never more to go on " crack' biz.," I was persuaded to f try this. I knew  Jack well, and that he was pos- n sesaed of resolution and courage, so I was not afraid of him hanging back in a case of emergency, and all i being agreed upon, we appointed the following night for the job to be done. I had, while we were over on the Dials, introduced Joe to Jack as an expert " cracks- man," and one that I  had done " graft,' with, else it would have been a hard matter for Joe to have a hand in, it being a rule with Jack to work only two-hand- ed, and if more was required, he would " turn up" the mob and wait for another that would suit. In this case his pal was sick and unable to attend to it, and himself all but a!" skinner," and for myself he knew me well ha- ving often been at " graft" with me. So after a game of "  crib" we parted with Jack, to meet the following day at the Feather public house, close by Waterloo Bridge, Southwark side of the Thames. The following morn- ing, after a Cockney breakfast (gin and soda-water,) Joe and I took a stroll in the Park, and the ("Start" be- ing a new place to him, he was much pleased with the wonderful sights he met with. After leaving the Park I thought to surprise him with a sight of the British Museum, and to it we went. As we entered our canes were taken from us, and a ticket given to each of us with a number on it corresponding with that hung on the canes, so that upon leaving we might receive our own back. I had noticed a suspicious looking " gun, ^as I  thought, but not having any intention of t' graft" we took very little notice of him, merely wishing to show my chum the wonders of the Museum. When we got to the Sculpture room there was a great crowd of visi.   , 1,in knobt of from five to twenty, making quite a little " push. In one of these "pushes"I observed this the same seedy looking fellow I had taken notice ef I when entering, drawing a " stuke" from the " bloke's" tail He must have been a beginner at the " stuke busz zing" game, for he "grafted" very clumsily, and "tumbled" the " bloke." He was seized with the " fo. gle" in his " duke,', and given in charge to one of the policemen at the door, who took him off to the station- house. I had seen too many " pinching" affairs in the name building, not to take my sue how to proceed in this matter. I knew that when any one is " copped" in there the "of- ice is slung" to the detectives, who make a thorough search of the building, and in that case it would not suit us to be seen by any of them; for although none of the " fly. sops" knew Joe,-there were several of them that knew me, and we had too much at stake to remain any longer in there; we commenced a retreat, and got to the entrance in time to see the "stuke buzzer ' hauled off to the "booby hatch.' We gave our tickets,'and our canes were return. ed to us, and off we started for the a Feathers"Public House, Waterloo Bridge, glad to get away so cheap from the dungeon that threatened us in the Museum. The British Museum is one of the best places in London for a " wire" to " pull a bag" away-there are so many rooms, and a continuous flood of visitors going and comrn ing in an of them.  The usual style of " grafting" this place is to have four or'five stalls along with the " wire," and assa bag comes off' to " sling" it to one of the stalls, who carries it out of the building, and in some public house near by turns it out, " slings" the ' poke" away in the - dunnnkrin,' and returning to his " mob" takes the place of another, whom he meets going out on a similar errand. We got to the Feathers, where we found Fisher waiting for us. We arranged everything for the ' graft" that night Joe, Jack and myself met at the rendezvous on Tower Hill, and after a ' lash" or two, went outside to make a final arrangement, there being too many in the ' lush drum"  to suit our purpose. When near the "Mint," Tower Hill, and while in confab about our biz., who ihould we meet but Mike Haydon, the city ," fly-cop."  He   had "pinched" Jack once, for attempting to "screw" a  "drum," and, of course, we felt pretty sure of a "turn over," and in that case, there was a sure I drag, (three months) for each of us. Jack had the t "screws" on him. and of course he felt pretty certain 1 of ' copping" his I' time," for there was no opportu- t nity of "slinging" them away. Mike keeping his eye E "'peeled"for such little affairs in the "game," he l thought he had us sure, but Fate ordered otherwise, t and hastily telling Jack where we would meet him, we D leisurely stopped at the mouth of an entry, leading e from the Catherine Docks through to Rosemary Lane, il and appeared to be holding a converstaion among our.-  selves. We "stalled"Jack within the entrance, white i   a we kept outside, and in a position to make Mike believe b the three of us were there. ButJack took to his heels,  If making for the place we had appointed to meet him. . "Joe and I then, after giving Jack suficient time to get i. out of the way, turned round and walked ftowards the d "cop;" he let us go past, but he seemed to wonder ). where the other was,.and to satisfy himself he walked e towards the entry. At that moment a cab came along, t- and. as quick as thought, we jumped inside, telling the e cabman to drive as quick as h-- would let him, a   "Where to?" says cabby. "Where the h-I you like, only drive on," we returned. He seemed to know there  was something up, for he laid into his nag unmercifully, h in order to clear much space in a short time, and before s many minutes he had laid us down at the King's Head,  Whitechapel road. We took him in and treated him, be- y sides "slinging" him a crown for his short but quick n ride. He considered himself well paid, and we consid- e ered ourselves well done by. F  The next thing was to get to Jack, and for that pur-  pose we had to take a roundabout journey by the Com- "meroial road, striking towards the river at Stepney, so a that we then were in a line to the place where Jack was to be waiting for us. We arrived at the public house, and there found Jack, who had almost given us up as "pinched." It was here agreed upon that Joe should be the outsider, and Jack and myself go in. Joe did not like this arrangement, and expressed himself pretty , openly on the matter. He  was not going to be any bloody outsider for any " mob," so long as he was able and willing to see the inside. Why the blaizes did we not tell him that before. '* Blast my bloody eyes if I have any thing to do with the job without I have to go in" Seeing that he was determined upon going in, we hit upon a plan with which we thought to satisfy him. The servant girl came out for beer every. night about 9 o'clock. and crossed over the street to the public house opposite.  As she came out she merely drew the latch on the door. Jack had found this out nights before, when " piping the place off." So we agreed that Joe should take advantage of this, and while the slamkin" was in the public house for the supper, he should enter and secrete himself among the bags of grain in the back part of the store-house There was some danger attached to this part of the performance, and for that same reason he undertook the job. Having agreed to the plan, the next thing was to give him instructions. The danger spoken of was this: The "bloke" of the "drum" was in the habit of staying out until 10 or 11 o'clock, smoking his pipe over his glass, in a favorite resort of his, within a stone's throw of his store, and upon his return home he rarely missed examining the place, inside and out, to see that everything was safe. So we told Joe, and he was will- ing to put up with the consequences; for of all things Joe wished to be an active partner in everything that was go-  ing on-there was no drawhack in him. So, to put him '   "ely," Jack explained the routine of the night's proceed. ingMs. As IT RA TO 3 O DONE. In the firt plac he had to enter when the 'elamkin"l had crossed over to the "Iush-drum"- for her and the honsehold's beer, then to Imake his way to the rear of the store, and secrete him self as best he could among the bags of grain stored there, in a manner that would defy the watchfulness of the "bloke"' when he came in and overhauled the "dram." His next affair was, when everything was lovely," to give us the ', office" by putting a straw tm der the door, which straw meant that all had gone to bed, and everything was ready for action. It was good for us that we had made that arrangement, for afterwards we found out that a heavy bar was placed across the inside of the front door. Had it not been for this arrangement, we would have known nothing of the bar, and consequently would have had to defer our in tended "graft" until we had other " tools" along with ns, fitting for such a job. However, we "piped the lsamkin" coming out for {he Ad insh," and giving Joe the office, went over to the door, and lifting the latch, in he went, closing the "jigger' quietly behind him. This done, Jack and I stood round awhile, taking notes how things stood. We saw the "slamkin', return and open and close the door, as if nothing had happened. And a few minutes after, knowing that c' so far so good," we agreed 'to'leave the neighborhood, in case we might throw a chance away of being recognised; so off we went to a street higher up, and in it we came across a public house called "' Paddy's Goose," where Jack and  [ entered for the purpose of passing the time until we  were required at the  , dranm,' Time flew on, and we  thought that we mnst be up and doing; so off we started  for the " dram" to be ; bum'ted." When we arrived there we passed the door several times, and were surprised to see no "office" ready for us. Of course we could not tell his reason for not " slinging the office," and thought m' there must be something wrong. Perhaps the "bloke" had "copped" Joe, and we ignorant of it? Perhaps he fe had not come in yet? To put that matter to rest, I vol. i unteered to find out if Jack would only show me which 19 public house the " bloke" used. So off we went to the an "hush drum," where the "chump" used to go, and ta- it king my  cue from Jack, went in and asked if Mr. So. th and-So was within. I  was told he was in the parlor. ba That would have been sufficient for me, had not the su landlord called him by name, saying there was a gen- the tleman wanted to see him, I did not want to " throw fro my mug away," but in this instance I could not help it, ' a and so I  put a bold face on the matter. He came out lon and I  asked him if his name was so and so. " Yes sir, an what is your pleasure with me, 7" I told him I had ta.  Zen a  contract for a number of horses, and wished to doo mnow privately for what he could let me have the feed qou br the same?  The bait took, and calling me away on ope one side, he began telling me the prices of the different it, a Mids of grain and feed be had. He had not the lenst Jac   end. suspiioOn of me, fol there steood, with book and penail had in hand, taklng down the figures he promisd to sell at, the I wished this 'buiness to close as sooe as possible, for a to I was afraid he might ,' pipe my mug,", ad in case of im anything turning up be ablf e to identify me; and the )red "cops" aowingame, it mwht,eantogether, make wlink s of in the chain of evidence. So I closedp tho 'interview the with him, telling him I would call upon himn soie other as time, and weas orry that I had called ht so late an hour, un- but that being on business down that way, - thoght I t to would call as I passed. We bade "good night" to each other and off I went to Jack, who received, me with a ; was Wat the b-y h-I has been keeping you all this n  time? couldn't you see whether he was in or not, with- outkeeping me waiting for you all this time?'t c Keep the dark, Jack"  I replied; , You don't know what I had in to do before I could get away. The "bloke' is there, ith and I could not get away. However, it is all rightnow, he think he will soon be coming home, so let usn .pipe e him off,' and be ready for Joe's office"' I then told hhim what had passed between me and the "  bloke." h We stood at some distance from the!" lush drum,' ais where the grain dealer was, expecting too see him come in out every miunte, and in about half an hour he came i aout and walked towards home, we following him; We saw him enter the store, and watched with anxiety the ret fate of poor Joe, but in ten minntes our fears were al. re layedwhy seeing the light return, and after disappearing for a   minute or so, show a bulght light in the front d room, first floor.  e had to be very careful now, for it e was late and the watchmen were around; so off we e walked for safety, and entering a 1ot "liush. drum," d (for no other was open then) took a big " staver,', and sat down for an hour or aso, until we thought the ' "bloke'" was in a "snooze" t It was now near 12 o'ciock at night, and thinking all o must be quiet at the " drum,s we moved towards there. ,We met none on the road towards there, excepting a few drunken sailors, who took no notice of us, and we slid quietly to the "mark-"The " office" that all was right within, was to be a straw slid below the door, and the "  office" in return to the pal inside was to draw it out twice and back again, so that he was sure it was the right party that got hold of the straw. We walked backwards and forwards two or three times, to make sure no one was" on," then crossed over, and drawing the straw, gave the 'office." The door was opened from within by Joe, who had, as he said, been waiting I'a h-1 of a  time" for us; but I snppose it seemed longer to him than it did to us, However, we were in, and now we saw the benefit of seuding Joe in first. The front door had a massive bolt right across the door, and had we not " planted"Joe inside, we never qould, with the tools we had with us, have gained an opening to the house. We secured the door as we found it, and proceeded to the counting room with a " jimmy" Jack had along with him, We opened the drawers and   i ate bxes, but found little of consequence; and af- i  ter tying the safe, which we failed in opening, left that place for the . up stairs department. (When it was, put up to Jack he was told where the " sugar" was to be I  found, all done up in canUvas bag and placed in a secret Il recess in the wall; but he had forgotten whether it wa's the front 'room r the second.-This will explain the mistake we made afterwards.)  We had s door to open which was bolted on the in- side, and all being so quiet, we dare not '" burst" it for fear of alarming the inmates. So we thought the best way would be. to wait until a carriage would be pass. ing, and then smash the glais'lver the door. We had -to wait over an hour before one come along, that place being'out of the line of travel at that tiam of night, al. though, during day time, it is a great, thoroughfare for t wagons, etc. At last we heard one at a distance, and Jack stooping-, I got'my feet on his shoulders and stood ready for the moment. Up came the cab, driving furi- ously, loaded with tipsy sailors, and as it dasbed past the house, bang  went amy hat through the window- There was some noise made by the falling glass, but not sufficient to awaken those above. HowevOr, We stood perfectly quiet for about ten minutes, to see whether there was any " tumble." . When all was still again, I got on Jack's shoulder and putting my arm as far through as I could, reached  the bolt, and so' opened thb stair door.  All being still, we took off our shoes and tied them n over our shoulders, and stealthily followed each other up stairs. when we gotto the first landing neither of P us had brought the piece of candle along, it being left F at the bottom of the stairs. So Joe was told to return for it, and down he went, and returned with what had S once been a  piece of candle, bat was now a flat piece of t tallow. One of us had stood upon it and made a cake of it, for it was blown out immediately after we had turned over the pounting house, ahd dropped or laid close by the door. Well, we were in a  fix now, as we could not ", graft' without a light.. It was a serious job we were about, es but, for the world, neither of us could keep from laugh. st ing, when Joe in the dark slipped the cake into our an lands, saying,  , Here is the candle."' Jaek made his ge way to- the kitchen, and there found all the candle we to required. Now, which was the right room?"L B-my fr eyes if I havn't forgotten,, said Jack.    up saSuppose we try them all, and then we'll be right,' At said Joe.                     di "But the 'bloke' and his 'mol' are asleep in one of th' them," lAplied Jack.               w  "  Well, hold on a bit, and I will soon find out which  he is in, boys."                 in And away went Jack, '"earwigging' at each door. t Back he asme, pointing to one of the doors as that where  the family were sleeping in, and at once we set to (graft. rou Joe twas stltioned at the bedroom door, "jimnriy" in hand, Fra   l af while I held the grim" for Jack to " screw the "jig- ger." It opened, and in we went, but we had put our put foot in it this time, for no sooner did we enter than a be child started a squalling in the highest key. .'What's 'ret p o  ?" ' cried Joe, running from his post at the door. as ",We'll be all pinched,' assure a h-1. Bring out the the light and shut the door,else we're bound up com. pletely." fn.  Oran Joe to his station and we to the next door, for or what was to be done had to be done quickly. Sharp was est theword and sharp was the work, for in a twinkling 8d. Jack had the "jigger unslewed,', and both of us entered ad and made for a small curtain that hung against the wall, oe Behind this was the recess containing the folding-press, al- or cupboard, in which the " sugar" was deposited. In or a twinkling Jack had his "jimmy" into it, and open it nd flew with a crack; but we could not stand on niceties at od  that moment. We collared the three bags, full to the rt top with silver coin, and a small box with a few sover. eigns in it. I was for starting, but Jack had not done w yet. There was a quantity of silver plate. and into his ut great pockets he commenced ' planting" it. He had not e got all when the "office" was given that they in the' room were getting up, and out I bolted with the bags. ,. I had hardly got to the bottom of the stairs when a dread. d ful encounter took place between the "bloke," Joe and Jack. I  could hear the blows falling, and the ring of metal, for it appears the " bloke" was armed with a po- n ker. Slipping on my shoes, I made for the outside, .and r got about a  quarter of a mile away when I heard  nmoe 'f people running behind me. I gave myself up for lost, and crouched behind a barrel. Up they came, and they proved to be Joe and Jack, nearly out of breath. We got safely to Tower Hill, where we got into a cab and drove f to Jack's honse, on the Boro, and there put the " sugar', "about. We tumbled it all into a heap on the table, and each set to, to count it into pounds. When all was counted, it brought us just sixty-three p unds in silver and two in gold, each. After we had put the "  sugar" about, we were inter. ested about what had occurred, and each told his own story. Joe's was this: " I heard the ' bloke' getting ip, and was determined he should not get out of the 'jig- ger' while I  was there, and I wished you to have time to make all things right; but when I started a little from the door to give you the ' office' that they were up, he opened the door and faced me bang in the ' mug.' At that instant I saw one of you ' namasing' down the 'dancers,' and knew that the ' stufft was there, and at the next moment he let me have it over the 'conk' which sent me staggering towards the wall, but r fared round and let him have it full in the ' mug.' Jack comr ing in gave him a   welt' from his 'jimmwy' which laid him flat. and then we ' namased' amid the screams of the wfe and the cries of the children." Next morning the "wedge" was "fenced', and put round, after whichi we thpught to take a   trip to Francc.   ] JToe, Jack andy myself, according to agreement, started off on our visit to France, and being flush of "sugar," meant to enjoy ourselves at whatever place we might stop, and take a " trick" as it might come, without putting ourselves out of the way about it.. The first pIgce we stopped at was Brighton, where I had often been before, and knowing some "flash drums" in the town, we made for them. One of them was called the "Artichoke,ni and-as kept by aman and his wife called Akehurst. Hee we met a " mob" from the " start," oonsi'ting of thefollowing renowned characters: -Johnny Gilderoy, the "wire,", Jemy Nick, Ikey Rowe, Jack Williams, and Jemmy Rowsell, "stalls" for the Scotch " 'wire." They had been fPwn from the " start" only a day or two, and from wtirt we heard, had given the place a "sweating." This did not suit us very well, for, were we 'pinched' for anything we might do, the blame of the others would surely be " whipped" on us; so we agreed not to try our " dukes" there, but to spend our time in pleasure-hruting. - The Artichoke had what they called a ball almost every night, attended by milliners' apprentices,'artif-  cial flower-makers, shop, girls, &c.' withy a 'sprinkling . of " flashkept molls." Among the latter was one o named Mary Ann Scott, a  reasly beautiful girl, who 1 had been married but a  few months previous to the l proprietor of several pleasure yachts inBrighton, but c who had been seduced from her husband, almost im- d mediately, afterwards, by a visiting "swell" to the r town, .who promised a flne house, " slaveys," dc., fort her, and visited her ocasionally from London, merely, I as she said, to see how she got along in her,house- keeping. This night she eame to the ball in company a with a  "case" keeper, named Betty Bignell. Jetty lI was well known, far and near, for her jolly qualities h and jolly size (she weighed at that time the enor- a mous weight of twenty four stone and four pounds, m and was called the Brighton giantes--her brother de kept'a wine-cellar in the Haymarket, London), and th also for her endeavors to satisfy all who called at her of "  dossuing crib," a few rods off, where she kept re- as freshments, &c., for man and beast; and being some- n what intimate with the "start guns," carled in, along fa with pretty Polly Soott. It happened that, a few dals r before, Jfemmy Nick andrhea lovelr Polly snarled in Wr the "  startl over something that Jem had been doing 5s to the "a rvey," where they lived, in Martin street, Borough Rboa d he consequence of which was that I ha they agreed, fithe one hundredth time, to " split," it and down h     ]came to Brighton in the "Scotch Beoy '  mob"-on the-p" ipt     .         e i Jemmy wast th, t   time * very portly person, an dth not over bia looking, although. a few years soon I1?I makes matril'dffrencetln a "gul"l10oo oepe go; "illy .if h.,can .throw away the " , ;" ir,the style fty l that Nick cad,o o,d , Whe n ,Betty Bignell ade ner t appearance iF the danolng room ; 1,4U ygswere ture Io immediately upon Jemy'as the .most eligible partner hot for Betty; and, as- there was every sign of a good ofre   ient, laugh at seeing those two heavy mettles bobbbe of around, we stated the subject to Jem, who, bei  lae pretty well corned, readily aocepted, and sailed h  )me,. side^of ahouso out to her place on the floor.

Some were looking for their bonets and shawls, and eagerly watching an oppor- Wnity to bolt from the room, while others were shout- ing for the police; and. amid all, poor Ikey Rowe Q beefing" for assistance, while Taunton Call was lay. fg into him with a stone wrapped in a handkerchief. I s twinkle some one turned off the gas, and the place was in darkness, crowded with men and women-the uproar and screams increasing in multitude and tone Ivery second; some crying and going into fits, and thers fainting. The door was opened, and in rushed three or four O' cops" who had been sent for at the station-house. $my brought lights, and the first discovered was the celebrated Polly Nick and Call Rowe, lying insensible on the door, their clothes disarranged, hair lying loose, Mad blood all over their faces. They were taken be- low to the bar-room and looked after by Mrs. Ake- pmrt, while the " flatty cops" took in hand to hunt up Jem and Ikey, whom they heard, from those around, were the parties implicated. But poor Betty Bignell! what a picture she looked-one eye in mourning and the Hoter like it, while her " smeller" looked the very {adge ofa " buffer,"' and her scalp in a state of infancy, [or covering. She was known to the " cops," and in Outtone and all would have done anything for Betty, or^ he was a very generous hearted creature and ir!ed very little about " smoking a quid" or two with EthoEm ho liked her well. But she Was bound to have thatrwoman that pitched into her taken up; for as yet she knew not what relationship Jem and Polly held Boiards each other. After a little coaxing from the "ecops" and a drink or two at the bar, she left for tomen, a'n the dan Ve was broken up for the night. It appears that when Polly Nick heard ofher "bloke" iOtng to Brighton along with "Scotch Johnny," she' made up her mind to have a " flying" in Manchester; mad with that intent, was overhauling her trunk for oae "sugar" she had planted there, unknown to emny, as she thought; but she was too late, and ,emhad" sprung" the "plant" and " namased" with the sil t." Her rage,-upon finding she was bested, was of the ikhet/fi ndL , She swore she would follow him to h-1 bat what she would have her "sugar" back; and kmowing that Ikey Rowe was one of the "mob," she e&Led upon Call, and promised to pay her fare if she weold accompanyher. Poll knew the " crib" where hey were likely to piut up at, and made for it, where they arrived in time to see their " blokes" escorting ifi dancing partners to the seats after the first dance. ow. ein afar, sallowed thom to observe what Wumgoinga wi t hose' seated at'the table; and Jem. p   befingso pleased with hi d rst performance with   Betty, was pretty free of expressions. He gave Sev. ' oeral orders to the waiter to replenish the glasses, and  seemed altogether taken by storm with the huge po- , tion of humanity beside him but all this was noted 3 by Poll at the "jiggers," who took good care not to r let her " chum," Call Rowe, go without a touch of the r green-eyed monster, for she wanted a partner in this affair. So when Call saw Ikey sitting alongside of the beautiful Miss Scott, her " dander" rose, and she and Poll were sworn for the "slog ;" so down they went to the bar, and after Swallowing a treble X glass of brandy, each got ready for action. The waiter, in high glee after witnessing Jem and Betty's laughable performance, was returning to the bar for orders, when he was asked by Poll whether they had a dance every night in the week, and he, oat 'of fun, said that this dance was given by Jemmy in honor of the contemplated marriage between Betty and himself. This it was that stung Polly, so seizing a pint pot, she called on Call to arm herself with stones, and the two took their stations at the door, waiting for an opportunity, with what success we have re- lated. In the morning we took a stroll out on the chain pier and along the Parade, where there was plenty of chance for a " dip" to " come off," but we cared lit- tle about chancing it, satisfying ourselves with recon- noitering for a " burst," although we did not mean to do any " graft" right off, until bur " sugar" got low. At last Joe, whose experienced eye nothing could pass without being noted, said he thought there-was a fine chance for-a " burst" in a jeweler's shop which we passed. So, to give him time to " pipe it off," Jack and I went into a public house, called for refreshment, and waited for Joe's return. .In about half an hour he came back, with a " show" on his " mug" that he thought all could be made right. So, after a drink, we took our walk down to the beach, where were seats at a little distance from each other. Upon one of those we Seated ourselves, and having no " earwig. gers" near, Joe commenced his story of entering the jeweler's store: "In the first place," said he, "I am sure there is no one living below in the basement-that I am certain of: and in the second place, there is some one or more who sleep in the back room at the rear of the shop; and again, the family live up stairs over the shop. It is worth trying for, but it is a -  tough job; what say ye?" "Jack replied that he did not care a -  how tough it was. He would saim in if the others were ready. This seemed to me to be going all one-sided, and although I had no great love for the I burst,' mori especially when on a  pleasuretour, as we then were-T, for the sake of unity, gave my assent, hoping, at the same time, something might occur which would change their minds. The fact of the thing was, 'bursting' was getting to be a played-out-' game' with me, and al- though I  had been pretty fortunate in what I had been engaged in, stil there was a something kept telling   me I had had enough of it. I as scared, but Iga In hopes ofin dig some means of barneyini the t job,I asked what made him so certain about the apartments and basement. i "Well, I'Ll tell you the reason I am sosmre of what I said," answered Joe. is When I entered the shop, I asked the young fellow there if my brother had left his watch at his esthshmentfor repairs, He said he did not know, but that if I would give him the name he would find out. I gave him a name and he referred to book, but could not find the name. I said I was st certain it was there where it was left; I might be mistaken, but J would inquire at home again, and be positive whether or not-only it was some distance from here and rather inconvenient to go and return Vaing  ' Well, possibly or. S. - , the foreman, can te you.   e is now up stairs; I will call to him and inquire.' With that he went to a spout and inquired of Mr. L, who returned  for answer thatthere  was no such name in at the time, I thanked him, ' and, in order to know all about the back room I t priced a truss, and after examining it, inquiredifI t could go in the back room for a minute to try it on, t '  r that I was particular i getting a good fit. I Oh, t yes, sir, certainly; follow me'--and in he walks me t to the rear room, where Itried it on and returned it to i! him, saying, 'I must get one made purposely, and h that I was  orry for giving him so m uch trouble.' b ' Oh, no trouble whatever, sir; call again, sir ; good h day, -sir.' I bade him good day and promised   1 w would call again, and I mean to do it, by -, i I liae  long enough.,             ,     ^ t Well, what  did yousee by going in the back  ' drum?)                ,  k saw a washing stand, towel, and sofa-bedstead, w replied Joe,!' -and they ain't there for nothing.,  "That's so," said we. i' Well, I'll tell you w hat I think wehad better do, wo boys. I think it would be as well to leave this and, it the may be, other jobs alone until we are on our return " s from Prog-land--that is, if you have not given up all off idea of the purpose on which we left London, namely, "m a Trip to France. What say ye?-and thenwecan thre '   spot' as we go along, and at our return ' graft' as So, many as we can of the ' drums spotted' besides, we Joe need not be in any great hurry, for there is no other nigh ' mob t hereabouts on the same 'lay ' that we are on ; you and again , we have plenty of 'sugar, and ought to my ] enjoy Ourselves like other folks, and not run like yo u bloody,' mugs, to  graft' all the time with our ' kic ks' wee full of sugar., Suppose there was to be any 'pinch- ward ing' in the case, what would become of ou r 'stuff*- r that, of course  , would b e found upon us Phen f ribk- I os  ed?

Joe knew that numbers present  were ," well acquainted with the fat and stylish brothel-keeper of Brighton, and for hiot to show any degree of knowl- edge of, or acquaintanceship with, such a characteri , would or might put a "derry", on behind us, and be it the means of , showing us up ." So he " stalled, his n  "mug" towards us, trying, by so doing, to II chalk her "off ; " but he put his foot in it, for Betty, who had beet r, " maxing, some before she entered the theatre, saw through the dodge, and her anger riz at the slight. So, amid her sauffling. panting and blowing, she tipped Joe on the shoulder and said,  ", How do  you do to- r night,  young man? you don't know m e ton ight,d you? What's become of that bloody cow ' that toro my hair out   last night, I want to ask 9 I am told that you know, and if you'll only tell me, IIIll treat for a week." This was a staggerer to Joe, and turning to, wards her with a   " square mug," he atked, in surprise, "Are, you speaking to me, ladam ,".t "Spealk ug to you! Yes; who else do you think I'm speaking to  And I   know who I am speaking to, too--a 'gun ' from the start ;' so you see it's no use trying to blind Beto for she ain't no child (twenty-four stone weight D but if   you'll tell me, as I said before, everything will be right , and you'll lind Bet a trump-you don't knoa me yet."   We were having all eyes tarned upon s., and feeling ' t Tetr- ueamsy under- it/we slyly whbisperedto, Joe to *qlUtret it with her, which he did, by pressing her faot with hi  She '" collared" the " office" like* a 9Ui ,and squaring herself in her seat, settled for the pl- ay Baying, IWell; I'l see. you after the first act, ih the refreshment room." Another pressure;of the oAt, and the afair was ended. S The. play commenced, and as' it proceeded Betty i uBI warmer, and made good use of her fan for some tme, until getting tired of her exertions, she resigned itm elf to her fate, and leaning back, sat there a jittming mountaln of flesh,-with, the- perspiration Zteaming down her face, neck and breast, (for Bet ,j haddressed herself a Za opera that night, and left her- :mll pretty bare.) "This won't hold out long," says lej in a whisper; "she'll have to ' namase' soon or melt all away, 'tie so bloody hot. What do you my to .urn it up ourselves and give her the slip? As Iw myself, I aint getting any good of the play, for, I bnow our--' mugs' are being ' grannled' all the time #tuoigh this bloody old hay-bag; what say ye?" *Well, wait unntil the act is over, and then we can rise andmgo out with the others without being observed."-' Wlether Bet " tumbled': to what was going on or not w could not say,- but it, seemed as if she did ; for im- mRdiately afterwards she began collecting all that be. bated to her, preparatory to a " move." As soon as So curtain fell on the first act, Joe arose from his seat FOd Betty followed suit, intending, no doubt, to have a Ub start with us ; but fate decreed otherwise, for, ilher eagerness to get out, she wedged herself im- ovably between the seat and the front rail of the boxes, while Joe and we passed over and out, but not without a final endeavor, on Betty's part, to extricate limelf, by clutching the skirt of Joe's " tog," and Hakg him as a brace to draw herself out, but 'twas Iwgo, and Joe left her stack there, amid the roars and lighter of the audience, until she was released from kT fix by the officials of thetheatre. Oa regaining Ui street, we made for a " lush-drum," and there fin- -.4 our laugh over the adventure with Betty. from there we proceeded to the Artichoke and mitecd out adventure to the "guns," where we had l  nergythlg c;'ared up. It seems Betty had called ollat$ for information, and one of the " guns," in a ^olgl of fun, told Bet that Joe was the only one who saw anything about the party she was inquiring after, and that we all had gone to the theatre. So cff sU started and fixed for the " gaff," and hence what Ikd happened, Not long after, the redoubtable Betty nwself arrived, and after an explanation, satisfactory U6 her, we -went to our room with the intention of Zaking ourselves scarce in the morning, for we had ap- pared rather conspicuously for the short time we were in Brighton. i Seeirg how things were likely to go, I resolved, in f weof a" pinch," that the greater part of my " sugar" 9bld be safe; so in the morning, having time before Oa trains started, I sent my " sugar"--all but what I   thought 1l should need-to old Bill Dann, the " fence," in London, to take care of for me, after which I felt less diainclined. to " grafte" than when I had so much at Istake in case of a " pinch." All being ready, off we started for Dover, and arrived all safe, without " dip or derry." Having been in Dover several times be- fore (professionally-, of course,) I knew the ropes of the place, and had no iifficulty in finding a congenial stopping-place, called the Royal Mortar, a public house in Military Row, kept- by a jolly little trump, named Tommy Rann. This house was somewhat sim- ilsr to the Artichoke in Brighton. It was a dancing hall at nights, a " boozing ken" at all times, and a re- sort for the higher class of traveling " guns.". It was well frequented by decent people, yet none of them- ever " tumbled to cross coves" using it. -Tommy was a short, thick-set paunchy "Cnes," and would " stand" for a thing or two if it suited him, never asking ques- tions nor interfering with the " biz;" of his customers, although he knew the several "lays" the different "mobs" were on.          * It happened just then that Tommy was in want of a "ridge thimble," he having " blowed" his last one in France, whither he had just gone to fix for-a contra- band sum of brandies, etc., for Tommy had more than one iron in the fire and wishing to get another, made known his desire to that effect. We asked him what he would be willing to " stand" for a good one, and having promised to get him one as soon as an oppor- tunity offered, we "lushed" and went out to see the town, I acting as guide. After visiting the " shapt," barrack s, etc., we stroll- ed towards the Castle. It being a fine day, numbers of visitors were there, some of whom'came by way of Ramsgate, Margate, etc. Upon reaching the top of a flight of stairs leading to the Castle, we were startled by the sudden ringing of a bell, and upon turning oar eyes toward it, saw a painted board immediately above the bell, stating that the ringers of said bell would be thankful to the passer-by for his charitable offering, and requesting that his or her alms be depos- ited in the small box fastened below the bell. "Pcor buggars," says Joe, "Let us ' sling ' them a ' bob ' (shilling) apiece; 'twill get them some extra ' chuck' or ' weed,'" and so saying he took from his pocket a shilling, and slipped it into the box, we doing like- wise. As soon as each of us had put in his offering, the bell gave a short tingle by way of thanks, and on the last deposit it rang out a joyful gingle, which so touched Joe that he proposed " slinging" them another "bob" apiece. As if they knew what we were say- ing, the bell kept on, directing our attention to the pla- card on the board, and the box beneath, and having deposited our " bobs" again in the box, we were mov- ing away, well satisfied with what we had done, when the bell again rang, and we looked towards the grated window from whence the bell was rung, when we saw three or four prisoners making signals to us, which we did not understand, and were about to move off when the bell was again violently shaken, and we were so-   leited to again contribute. "Oh, that be; ye kiow you can't kid ' me to stand here all day 'sling- ing?-my I pewter ' int your bloody box, even if you are, sloughed up, , said Joe. ,',You have 'munged  (begged) six" deaners already, and you don't ' whis- per' me any more with your bell-ringing," and of he started; Jack and I following. When we got inside the Castle, we found a large namber of visitors, and after a while picked out three or four to operate on. A short time after, while the guide was expiaining and showing the wonders of the Castle, we lobsed ih and " dipped, all we had "fpot    ted." Thd4-8skiinu" were " -slung t to Joe, to " turn out," and he moved away for the purpose of doing so, but retmned imnmediately ifter, saying he could not get out neither could we. The guide' had fastened the door as we passed on. What were we to do with the empty pursest-no venture, no win. I whispered to Jo   to $ turn them out" in his II kick," and then "sling"' them to me. Hbe did'so, and getting close to a " moll," I slipped the four "' skins" in her pocket, and no "tumble."   Just then you may imagine we were eager for the guide to finish his show, so that we might get out; for Joe said there was .' pap": (notes) among it, and of course If it came to a " stink"' and "frbk," we could not tell what the " stuff " was, for we had no opportunity of eeing. At last we got out- side, and-were taken bythe guide to'see the famous cannon, called "Queen Elizabeth's Pocket-Piece,'" and this gave Joe an opportunity to " namase" with the " swag," while we followed the "push." After the guide had fnishbed, several of the visitors put their- hands in their pooketsfor their purees, in- tending to give the guide a trifle-for his extra trouble, when, lo t-"Edwin, I have lost my purse 1" said one; another,- while vainly searching for it, was saying, "Where' could it have gone to t; I had it when I came into the Castle; tis astonishing I," I I declare, mine is gone, too I1" said: a fat old lady. "Gracious; how will we- ever get home without' money? this beats everything. Why, I had it when we came into the Catle; what is the meaning of this t?"  We had bet. ter send for a  constable," suggested a gentleman l standing by. But none appeared willing to undertake  the journey down town  for the " cop," so t7 was i given up. -In the midst of the commotion a loud laugh- C ing was heard, and making towards the spot, we saw r a young lady holding up a bunch of purses and inquir. n ing for their owners. They were speedily claimed by t those to whom  they belonged, and replaced in their i pockets, minus, of course, of their contents. There v was no suspicion had of the lady who found the purees  in her pocket, as she was a well-known resident of p Dover, and one of a party who had come to see the b eights of Dover. Before leaving, the guide informed b the visitors that there was just then two of the London ea "swell mob" in the Castle taken up on suspicion of b picking pockets. He was right, for at that time Tom- my Stevens and the Deaf 'uan were serving a " drag" p   re for the "dip," and had only lately commenced their g- term. m  In course of time, we followed Joe down to the town, 1' and having found him, we were surprised at the s- amount turned up" from the four "skins." Our ie lack turned out to be two ten-pound notes-a five and nine " quid" in " ridge," besides about thirty shillings e in "wedge,'" (silver). After we " put it abdit," we )e strolled about the town, waiting for the hour when e the boat would leave for Calais, and chancing to drop )f in at the Lord Warden Hotel, we overheard two offi. d cers in conversation, the purport of which was, that I " some troops on the way from India to England had "been telegraphed as seen within a day's sail of Dover, It and that they were hourly expected in sight." This wt as good news, for we knew that it would make a tre- e mendous " push" in the town, and consequently "good e for the dip.," What do you say, boys? Shall we stay o for this ' push' and ' graft' the town, or shall we go at nonce to France?"  , Why, what I think of it is this: I o think we are as well on this side of the water as the t, other, and p'raps better; besides, if there is a ' push, e we're likely to put something in our ' kicks' by stop. e ping." "A right, then, we'll stop." And even ) while we were talking, the cannons from the Castle 1 belched forth their welcome to the brave boys now in r sight, who had been fighting their country's foes ln the - far-off lad of India. In the course of an hour the boats were alongside, and the troops being diem-  barked, half of the town were out to greet them; also  h the bands of the different regiments stationed there. ( Knowing that we had a  fine chance of mraing some-  s thing  ", tall' in this affair, I posied the boys a to what we had best do,'which was that we "turn up's the ,  "graft" on the town's folks, and see to the offlcers of the regiment, now disembarking; for I knew thatthey w were all " sugared," and that they were " tail blokes"  -that is, carried their money la the skirt poCket of their ooats, as all offoiers then did; So I arranged that we should try separately to get on board the ves- el, and in-the hurry and bustle of the moment we could-surround and " nail' a " skit" or two from the "  kicksb'  of the officers. To get on board w*s the hardest affair, for there were sentries stationed at the different entrances to keep all away who had no per. mit to go on board; but this difficulty was soon got over, for I inquired-the names of several officers of the regiment from one of the sentries, and giving the names, told my " chums's the same routine I intended to follow, and that I expected to find them on board immediately after me. When I had posted them, i walked up to a  sentry and asked him if such anoloer was on board, and if I  could see him. He readily passed me, thinking I either belonged to him or had busines with him. Once on board, I was all right; but I  waited with anxiety to see my" chums" along- aide of me, and, as luck happened, they both got on board by the same means. On board aU was hurry and confusioa, officers and private soldiers mixed pell-mell, squeezing and push.   ing through each other as best they could. We went below, and, amid knapsacks and other military fixings, sawj several officers directing and ordering their men  with scarcely room to move among them. Now was our time, and. ging the " office," we closed in on a captain, and in less than a minute had his " skin" in our hands. This was " slung" to Joe, with the under. S:nding that he was to go to the head of the ship and "ding the skin." Off he went, and by the time we saw him again, we had another ready for the same operation. We intended to " sweat" four or five at least when we entered on board, but we were- foiled in any far- ther attempt by the officer whom we had at first "nailed.*"He accidentally discovered his less. He was about to pay a coachman whom he had engaged to carry his baggage, when, in feeling for his money, it was gone I Thismade a "stink," and as discretion was the better part of valor, we thought it time to ' " slide"; so, giving the " office," we separately, as be- fore, left the ship before any one noticed us as being strangers. We made our way very, quickly to the Royal Mortar, and having a fear that we might be dis- turbed, " officed" to Tommy that we wanted a room to ourselves. We were quickly ushered in to the bar parlor, and there, without fear or hindrance, ," turned out" the "sugar" from Joe's " kick." Hurrah I the ' Bag is off' at last," cries Jack, as he saw the "quids" and paper thrown out on the table by Joe "I'm off to - France, for one," and the sight that met our eyes was truly gladdening, for when counted, there lay over two hundred pounds in notes and gold-chiefly notes. ' We let Tommy have most of the notes at a small dis. "bunt, and having "squared" matters all right, left for the Calais boat. CHAPTER VI. t    "-BSWELL MOB"START FOR CALAIS---THEY ARE OAUGHT I1N STORM--ONE OF THE "MOB"MAKES THE ACQUAtITANCIN OF A YOUNG LADY-HOW  8He ASSI8 TED HM IN PASSING THBE UA&D WITHOUT BEXN(  "TUMBLED TO."  After a few preliminaries we succeeded in getting ( on board the steam packet that plied between Dover X and Calais, and having stowed away our travelling.  bags under care of the steward, we made up our minds c to take it easy; for, to quote Joe's words, "We had  plenty of ' sugar;' plenty of bl-dy cheek, and didn't c care a tinker's curse for anything." We had been a but a shaort time on our journey when the weather be. I gas to lower, and presently there arose considerable if of a storm, so much so, indeed, that it became a ques. tion whether to put back, or chance it and go on. w While this was going on, I noticed a young lady close- a lyveiled and sitting alone, and who seemed to be much distressed at the prospect before us. I felt for her, but was afraid to say anything, (not knowing but is -a few words of the French language, and they were q not appropriate to the occasion,) but in case she re- b quired assistance in any manner, I might be able to o neder it. I gradually approached to her side, and, Of   it just as a heavy lurch of the vessel heaved her from i, her seat, I caught her in my arms and prevented her n being badly bruised. As soon as she recovered her- 8 self she opened on me a volley of French thanks, a which well repaid me for what I had done, and leading n her to a more secure seat, I asked in English the plea.  sure of her company during the passage, in order that d I might be near her for her protection. I was gladly e astonished to hear her-answer in good Rnglifh: , "Sir, e I am thankful to you for your kindness; I am now alone, and live in Calais, at the Dover Castle, the a landlord of which is my brother; I have been on a  visit to a relation in England, and am now on my re. t torn home. If you intend staying in Calais to-night I s request you to come to Dover Castle, and you will 6 there receive the thanks of my brother and myself for t your kindness."' I then informed her of my purpose i in visiting France, it being merely a pleasure trip un. D connected with business of any kind, and that I was  one of three who had purposed seeing the sights of Paris, and that being a stranger to the country I felt e very fortunate and pleased in meeting with her, &c. During our conversation, and while I was with her, the storm increased, but the captain had made up his rmind to ran her over, come what would; and seeing that there was very little likelihood of a change for the better before reaching Calais, I wrapped myself up in my travelling shawl and posted myself alongside of my new acquaintance, who seemed nowise shy of my company. I iad been but a few minutes so set- tled when a sound, as if of a person ohoaking, caught my ear, and it being repeated I immediately reeog. sized my "chum," Joe, in heavy travail, leaning partly over the rail and " Blasting b-dy France to h.-ll. H-o-o-p-what the-h-o-o-p- hell did I want to come to h-o-o-p--come to France for?"This, and such likesex- pressions, were freely used by Joe, and in such a tone that the young lady overheard them as well as myself; but I was glad she did not see the person who uttered them, for in his affliction Joe pretty well " let the cat out of the bag." So to save all further chance of a "bawl-out," I  pretended to my fair partner that I had an errand to my bag, and off I made to Joe, whom I found clutching a part of the rigging and looking the color of a  sheet. As soon as he saw me he asked "  Get me some ' max' or I'll ' blue' my bl-dy inside out. I'll bet a bl-dy guinea you'll never get me on a steamboat again." I  told him to "cheese it," for that I had got a nice young woman to attend to, and that if she overheard him it would be a sure "crab" on me. "Crab, ,h--.; what do I care about nice young women just now?   Why the blazes don'tyougo below and bring the ' max' for a fellow?", "Well, where did you leave the fiask? , I inquired. "Jack had it last," 'he replied; ," but I suppose he is a ' croaker' by this time, and if you ain't d-d quick, some of them French b-rs will ' shaver' him before you get there, for he was lying all his length on the floor, unable to move when I left him." I hurried below and there found Poor Jack lying   amid his offering to Neptune; so, calling the steward, I, with his help, placed him in a more comfortable positin,- and refling the flask from the, steward's demi john, after giving Jack a little, proceeded on deck. Poor Joe was anxiously waiting for me, and eagerly bolted a "stiff-'un from the flask, after which I more fully acquainted him with the conversation I had with the young lady, showing him the advantages we might derive from having an introducotion in a foreign country.; besides, we needed some place to punt up at, any way, and why not at the Dover Castle as well as elsewhere?"Well, say the Dover Castle, or any other bl-dy castle, so long as we get off this infernal boat, for I'm nearly 'cracked' with the heaving and rolling, and the stink of oil." This was Joe's answer, so I left him and returned to the young lady, whom  I persuaded to take a small quantity of the '! Elixir" from the flask; I, in time, -repeated my persuasions, and by the time we were close to Calais, the " malt" had done wonders in the way of introduction, I had promised my fair one that the Dover Castle would be our stopping place, and no other, and having received ,certain instructions re.- garding the gens d'armie from her, proceeded upon the landing of the boat to follow her ashore. Upon our arrival, we had to march from the steam- boat to a building or depot, and on each side of us were a file of soldier-looking policemen, who closed in on the rear and guarded the building until the pas- sengers and their luggage were searched. 'Twasnow that I found I had not lost time on board the vessel, for the young lady of the " Dover," by some secret 1 sign, was allowed to pass without eramination, and I, i being as it were, in her company (and, I suppose, by  her influence) followed out with her. When we gotthrough the gates of the city, we turned 1 to our left, and made for the Dover Castle, where, af. ter being introduced and leaving my bag, I returned 1 to see how Jack and Joe were getting along. After t a  while they appeared, bag in hand, swearing at the ] French for taking their bags from them and " turing i them over." I  was a little inquisitive aboutthis, know- i ing that Joe and Jack, or one of them, had some tools I in their possession when we left Brighton; but the af.-  fair turned out luckier than could be expected. We F had each of uas bought a  travelling bag at the same A time, and the three were alike In size and color, and c upon the steward handing them to us upon our arrival, to we each got the wrong bag; and, as fortune had it;I a got Jack's bag with the few tools he had with him, p] and luckily escaped the  "' frisking" the others were ^ subjected to. So much for picking up with the Dover F Castle girl.                  f After Jack and Joe had left their bags in charge of pa the landlord of the Dover Castle, we went out to view " the city of Calais, and there being some expedition fit- F ting out at the time, the city was thronged with visit- wr ors and soldiers, the latter, in groups of fron five to w] twelve, drinking cheap wine and munching hard black to bread, a   piece of which they occasionally wrenched air   d, off from a large cake fastened on their knapsack be-  Ie hind, while the visitors, like ourselves, threaded and i's squeezed their way among them until we reached the an outlet of the square or market-place. Here, outside of Id a cafe, were gathered a crowd of officers in high and ;h angry dispute, all jabbering away at the same time, , I and pretty well " corned." We stood and looked on es until an oitoer on horseback rode inamong the crowd, a followed by three or four orderlies, intending to dis. to perse the crowd. At this there arose a 'greater din, le and some seized the bridles of the horses and tried to 9, prevent their riders from acting. Blows were ex.- is changed, and a general scratoh-and-tare fight ensued, te in the middle of which a company of gendarmes ap- peared and settled the hashby taking about thirty or Oo forty to the guardhouse, at the entrance of the city. II While this disturbance was at its height, I heard a A, vnice close to me, saying, "Haul it away; - my eyes! e haul it away; now is your time." This was said in ,e English, and upon looking in the direction from where t the voice came, I noticed three men surrounding and O swaying an officer, who wag attempting to back out 'I of the "pusb," but was prevented by those around u him, and ere a minute elapsed, the " office" was given that the ," bag was off," and they " namased" to it turn it out." I had not a fair opportunity of" grannying" 1 their " mugs ;" so to find out whether I knew them or I not, I followed to the hotel, where they entered. They had seated themselves and called for wine, as I and my " chums" entered. We placed ourselves at a table , in such a position as prevented them from seeing our t faces, yet we could hear and see what they were say- ing and doing. "Thunder me blind; we'll have to ' namase' now, for there'll be a d--  ' stink' over the 'nailing' of this ' skin. Don't you think we had bet- ter shove these papers in the fire? Let us shove the 'sugar' round, and make a  ' split' to meet at Bou- logne; don't you think 'tis best " "Agreed," said the others; " and let us ' namases immediately to the bureau and get our tickets by the D ligence to Bou- logne." While this talk was going on, I fancied I knew one of the voices, and upon their rising to leave, I did the same, and met face to face with burly Joe Fobbs, of London I He and his " mob" had been in France four or five days following up this soldier "push," and had given Calais a heavy sweating. Of course, we must" lush," so after introducing our Joe to Fobbs and his " mob," we proceeded two deep to a " lush drum.'"Instead of going tkrouih the market- place, Fobbs led the way round about, and after sev- ,ral turnings landed us in the - Dover Castle I Joe Fobbs "  slung" the " bloke" of the " drum" the " of. fice," and we were ushered into a nice little private parlor, where we sat and " lushed' and put each other "  fly" to a " thing 'or two." It appeared from what Fobbs told us, that the " bloke" of the " lush drum" was, or had been, a little on the " oross," and that all who were in the same line gave him a call either going to or coming from England, and that his sister (the nice young lady I met on board the steam packet) was   considered the smartest smuggler on either side of the waii, tA do, ho, t thbiit,-this explainfi the tele- graphing between hert ad -the gendarmi at the depot, and, in- fact, the-Dover was a- mighty resort of the taus- toms, officers. ..  'After we had "lushed" enough, and 'heard from Fobb' that 'Calais was rather' "hot" on account of their 'grafiing'" it so much, we concluded to take a trip, in company with the'otheirs as far as- Boulogne, and for that purpose went along with thent to the bu- reani and engaged our seats. As it-was some hours before the Dligftence would start from Calafe, and the city rather " warm," we agreed- to walkout as far as St. Pierre, a village a short distance from Calais; and there wait the coming; of the Dthigence. So, passing the guards at the city:entrance, we -got to St. Pierre; and, glad to find- an English house, dived into the, Cricketer's- Arms; kept by an -Englishman. Heie we rested,' ad being pretty well " set up,"'-comme ned: playtg cribbage, and continued so long playing that we mitised the 'Dlllfgehe;"and-had to wait until, the following day, when up came the nogrinly looking coah, and hailing it, we- desired the driver Ato take us- tn. He stopped the machine, but not understanding Faglpish e had a hard matter to get along with im, At-last, when we had about got outobf patience try- ing to make him oompra, an apothecary came to our. relief, He was standing at his shop door, and seeing the fix we were in, kindly undertook to be our inter- preter. He informed the driver that we had taken tickets for Boualogne, and wished to get inside ; but here Wre met with a new difficulty, for -the inside seats were all occupied, and besides, our tickets. were for, vberetiouls fay'a DiMlrenbe,'ana had nothing to Iad with- the one-he was driving. We let him know, by the apothecary, that'th caompany promised their Dil- ligenee hould stopi and take us in the day previons, but they had not done as they promised, and thero- fore we were entitled to seat each in the carriage. This seemed reasonable enough to the bystanders,  but-coachee;" couldnt -see it," and refused to let us  ride.- "I'R1be 4d-i-- f I'm going to pay for a ride and not have it," says Fobbs. "No, nor bast. my  hys if I'm going to O sling 'my ' sugar' for'Bflsle,/" said  another. A crowdhad'collected, and aminongthem the ladloird of the qrcketetB 'Arms and several of h I ctijtomeirs nglishwen-t-'who, along wiith the apothe- -t ca'r;-advised- us--to jump up and- stay- there until .we  reaehed our destinatioe.

The house in which this " sheeney" lived was a cu- rious and antiquated building, with story above story, and rooms opening into each other-by hidden and mysterious ways, known only to the landlord and some few of his most intimate customers, from one of whom, well acquainted with "Fobbs," we ere in- formed and shown through several of them. - From what was afterwards learned, this house be. longed to a trio of -"sheeneys," andwas used by them as a depot for contraband goods, and a rendezvous for those concerned in the business., One of the three was stationed in  England to look after the arrivalof the contraband, and to see to its speedy disposal. The second of the firm travelled-around andimanaged the purchasing part ofthe business, whilel the third, under -cover of keeping-a hotel, managed the ware- housing andtransportation of whatever was bought p by No. 2.: It was easy enough' for them to carry on this bmuggling busneess without fearof detection; for those whose duty it was to: prevent and ", show-up" anything -of the kind, were at that time--and it may be still-part propiietors, and as much interested in the safe-." getthroUgh" of their speculatiUons as the "sheeneys " themselves. Many thousand pounds worth of goods went through their. hands, and were landed safe on the -opposite;shore without: the (to them)hateful stain of a Customs, mark. This "sheeney"' landlord had a daughter, a beautiful jewess, 19 years old, of whom he was very-proid.' She was the only girl in the family, and was indulged in every wish she expressed.- Nothing was too costly.-nothing that money could buy was denied her, and the " sparks" and "togs" she wore would have ransomed a prince. We had only been two days in the place when she be. gan to look- "sweet". on one: of Joe's (Fobb's) "pals," and ditto on his side. Fobbs had been " starching"   himsetlf ap for her, and fanied himslf "ryebnck" on thtS'fllger,'" bqt with aU his 'flashisg"' of 'thimble' of ':spark .prop". and -" fawney,?. and lUbQraty, in; "salingt? :fo;wrine (on-purp o, : exibit. fp pks," an i othing else, for, a j aok -Fiser said, He .was:thq meanest penyn+oeving ' blokq!hat,.^ysr squeezed'h- self into a * gn" company py,') He couldp't " come it* over Beckey, and so was obliged to knucmle-nder to-his " pal.' We all knew how things stood, for he had bragged that daybef re us that she was " nuts'! on him,-and only waited for the ," ofAic, from him: o "namaset' England with him. So, when he ".oop pe#l Wpal" in thaot ,of impr#ting, -he ;could no lon- ge r ,i* hio iselffJRt bPurt hito th.-room, ,his great eyqsbl'm st:timbling out oftheir sockets, and:ra'iing both h an furipusly roared " * * * r a * me if h*ain't-edged .pe outi 'I collaredthem at it-right at it,.insidethe doorway," "Who? .what? what, is it?" weiiquired allatonce. "Why, my   * *  dont you .MW t- Don't you know how ' sweet' that little 'sheeney moli, has .been ,on me ever since we canme here and .now I've- juat ' collared' that little Tom- my; kissin g her insame .the doorway. Thunder me blind if f: don't be one with him if he is going to 'shatrp me of anything I have on-hand." We all burst into a h t langh, and ringing the bell, ordered two bottles more of wipe, and dra-nk to Tommys-sueoess with the young and beautiful "ahIeney. moll." . In a short tine Tomy-: cqmo in: and stood ,he. bantering- about the youeg ". sheesey,' and seeing that it "'pinohed," Joe. called for half a dozen of the best, saying that before onV;moat ha rwuln - maketht. lovely girl his wife, No, llVe blast ifyo do, andP llbet she is ' sweter' on this , gmn' than you imagine with: all your 'kid- ding .on the :quiet', and edging of ethers out, and I'll bet you a ';finifp that;I get her to go with me to thi ' ga&tl to night, asn Ill bet another ' finniff that she tre fuses you. Will you takeme qp " "Stake your 'sugar,"' repliespTommy, and the money was staked om both sides-little Jack Fisher being stakeholder. Tommy had a pretty-little" wedgesuper" which he carriedalong with him, and having seen the "shcenegy, throw shepop's-ey- es:on it, .resolved that this should mal e a oertainty of the affair by making a present of it to her., He thought-"Ilf she ' collars the super' then I am sure she is 'sweet' on me and won't refuse going to the ' gaff, with me. In that case I win a double 'fin- nifM and herself in the bargain-that I'll take care of, and. then the 'super; is as much mine as hers, and more too; but if she goes with me to the 'gaff, and then re. fuses me more-why then I don't lose anything, for the ' super' is worth no more than the bet I win." Thus reasoned Tommy,- and having come to .this conclusioun he Watched his opportunity, and while Fobbs and the others were engaged talking and drinking, slipped oat of the roomwe were in, and entered the bar-parlor where the pretty cause of the bet sat crotcheting. He sodn returned with a smile on his " mug" indicating success, and those who were in the secret, saw hewas mkaus hia "thimble," and from that augured " rye-   buck" on that " gn." We all were getting "pretty tolerable?' by this time, Joe Fobbs in particular, and not wishing to get too far muddled before the bet came off, propt , a, aI outeon;th  pier. All agreed with the exception of BFbbs, who remained behind to "kid the sheeney," and out walked the five of us. We had not reached the pier beforewoar number was decreased by one, andthat one--Tommy I In about two hours he four of us returned iome, that is to the "sheeney lushdrum," and upon entering the room set apart for our company, found Joe and Tommy three parts gone and in the best of- humor with each: other, laying bets of immense value on Lhe issno of that night's proceed- pnp neither of whom from appearance being,likely ,to know who won nor who lost. By strong "kidding, we. Anduced both. of them to- lie down for an hour or two, promieing faihfolly to awake them in time for the "gaff." In taking Fobbs to his room I noticed that a very pretty *' spark fawney," which he was a the habit of wearing, and which I had observed on his finger that day, was non est and in case of future ill-feeling be- tween us: on account of this ring, I thought it prudent to mention it to him, saying, "Joe, do you know that one of your ' sparks' ain't on your ' duke' just now?" "Ain't it? and which one isit that's gone?"-and he held out his hand for me to examine ; but I detected a smile on his coarse-looking "f mug," and immediately said, "Why, you have ' planted' it somewhere, or else it is in your ' kick.' "No, I hain't got hit (hic-cup), but I know blarsted well where it is; and if you pro- mise me that you won't '-come it' on me, I'il tell you, b-y 'lark,' and where the 'f wney' is." I promi ed and telling me to sit down, he began I "You know when the whole of you went out and left me in the room I Well, you all thought that I was too ' lushy' for anything, but I'll be blast if I was, for I was only ' kidding,' and after all of you left I went into the bar-parlor, and that little duck of a ' sheeney' told me to sit down-and I know she is ' sweet' on me, although that.' kid,' Tommy, fancies he is 'eye- buck' with her. But hold on till I tell you, only you musn't crack a lay' until after I win the bet, and then you ean do as you have a mind to. Well, I sat down and began ' cracking' to her, and, sir, she swallowed everything I said. I told her that if she was willing, I would take her to London and ' switch' her, and prom- ised her anything she wantea, if she would only agree to come with me. i noticed her eyeing that ' fawney' you spoke of, and taking it off my ' duke,' I told her if she would only'promise toloome with me to the thea- tre that night, I would; make her a present of it, and anything else she ,might,want. I was afraid she wouldn't collar' it; but she said she would ask her mother first, and off-she went to ask her. When sho came back I could see that it was ' rye-buck,' and seating herself down by my side, I took the ' fawney' and ' whipped' it on her finger,. and there it is now. So now you muan't ' crack a lay' aboutthis to any one, for don't you see I shall be a winner of a double ' fi-   ifr, and have the 'moll' thrown in besides? Do you ' tumble P1 ,; O yes, ofourse I ", tumbled," and after promising him that he Should be awakened before Tommy, Ileft him, and on reaching the room below, found from ak d? Tom. y had gien him a similar history to that I had been listening to from Fobbs e In the afternoon a carriage drove up to the door of I the hotel, and after waiting about half an hour de-  parted. Being occupied playing a four-handed game  of cribbage, we had not noticed who came or went in l it; and it being about time to call Fobbs and Tommy,: t Jack and I left the room for that purpose.  i It was a matter ofindifference to us who would win b the "sugar" and " sheeney,", but we thought it but fair  that each should have an equal start, and for that par.  pose agreed that both of us should enter the room ofe. s his charge at one and the same time, and Immediately l awake the sleeper. The rest was to be left to them. m selves. At the signal we opened the doors, and each har. f *riedly awoke his man and left him in a few minute. b Toammy was below, and having , brashedhis feather and put himself to rights, he made for the bar, inquir- do ing of the garcon if the young lady had gone out (it ha being agreed nuon that he should meet her at a cqfe bo near by, so as to avoid being seen leaving-the hotel loc together). He was answered in the affirmatie, and CO drawing on his kids and takings fninshg look at thehs mirror, he sallUfed out to meet his inamorata. the Immediately after Tommys' departure, Pobbs made him hib appearance and hurriedly inquired if Tolmy was ted up. To carry eut the Joke, we told him that he had I not arisen yet, and that now was his time to i-cceed,  So off he bolted to the bar-parlor, and not seeing his I W ' sheeney, there, Inquired -of the gareon where the niff  young lady was. The garteeon understood but a few that words of Rnglinh, and was unable to answer Joe more Som than by repeating, "Tee-ater, tee-a ter.,  "AIl'  gsa right," maid Joe, and calling us together  he called for A the wine. "It's all ' rye-buck, I suppose; I told her i to mneet me in the theatre and she has gone t he ad vent of me.  Tell Tommy he needn't hurry himself; me and whic my 'moll' will take a drink-with him when we return had from the 'gaff;" , and off he bolted. We had a roar- doing ifg good laugh at how things were going on, yet could vulse not "ttumble" to the real hing, although we all agreed derm there was something in the wind more than dust. In ased the midst of our snltfispgS .In walked Tommy with a * W handsome  walking-cane in his hand, which he had Why  bought on his way toJoin his pretty " shcsneg,, and moll? with a hce as grave as a parson's. He merely looked As around, and turning to the bar-parlor, entered and were asked the garcon "if the young lady had left any mes- sage for him ,' "Oh 1 oui, fonsigur /, He begged were pardonnez-had forgotten, very sorry, etc., and ran to "Sold the bar, from whence he brought a nice little note, ngma upon opening which Tommy read: "Gone to Dover.

We had been , ppig n Jack 'br thisl aftir, and now it appeared to as to be comifng that I to a head, for Tommy entered the room and vexedly threw himself into a hair. He didn't seem in a talka. oor of tive mood; so, to make a move and throw out a feel r, de- er, one of our Party says, "I'll double the bet with game ygou, Jack, ifyou like; will yout, 'No, I don't think ent in my side'll win,-from the looks of things. The bait mmy, took, and Tommy turned round, asking, What bet is it? what are you both betting on P, "Well, we are I win betting on that mell' affeir between you and Fobbs, it fair and I took you for the winner, because I thought she ;pur. was ' sweeter' on you than him.", "1 think shewas m  of. sweeter' on gmy thimble' than on either of us, for the atel! aunning little -has ' namased' to Dover and got hem- my'super' in her 'kick;, I must have been a b-y, ' mag' ang way to 'sling' it to her before going-to the  hur- gaf with me, as she promised; but I dont lose the ates. bet anyhow, for she didn't go there with Fobbs.

He otel looked rather blue on it, but-tried hard to keep his and courage up. Advancing towards where we stood (we the had all arisen when Tommy commenced telling about the super, and stood so 8asto surroaud im and hide, Wde him from Fobbs, eye on entering), he struck an atti.  ras tude and exclaimed: iad "Gentlemen-hem --gentlemen, I  am b--y well ed. sold, and the ' sheeney, is a 'nsmaser' and a little his shiser'-serves me well right. Blewed a double I in he nifft, and  b-y  fine 'spark' besldes-allthrough Bw that bubbly-nosed I kid,' Tommy, who has got her to re some ' dram' by this time, and I'll bet a quid' he k1l gammons' the '  fawney, from her, besides., . or  At this burst we eould contain no longer, and all er finvultlneously (writh the exception of Fobbs) gave id vent to a  loud and, continued roar of laughter, in id which Tommy indulged more than either of us.- We a had separated during the turn of langhing, and by so, r- doing, Fobbs discovered Tommy, sitting almost con. d vulsed with laughter; and moving up to him,with won. d derment strongly pietured in his 'mug,' he eagerjy asked: "Why, what the * . is the meaning of all this? Why ain't you at the ' gafr'where is the ' sheeney moll?'-where did you leave her?"', ete. i As soon an Tommy could collect himself he an- I swered: "Doan't you see through it, you b-. .y, mug O'-why, we're, both sold   ' and another laungh followed. "  Sold-as dead as Barney's bullsb-the little crse has 'numased, after ' kidding' me out of myJ 'rsuper,' and has left only this eard behind.," "What does it. say on the card?" (for Joe FobbW could'nt tell a Q from a bed-wrenoh.)   "Why, all it says is this--' Gone to Dover-back in a week.'" "Well, 111 be blasted if that aint bloody sharp work, nay I be 'croaked l' The blasted little Jew heifer ;namased' with my fine ' fawney.'" "Well, she has ' namased' with my ' wedge super' what I ' slung' her, to ' kid' her going with -me to the !gaff,'" replied Tommy; " gso I am as badly sacked in as you are." But that was no consolation for Fobbs, who, afterscratching his " nut," came out with a- A"Well, thunder-me-blind if that blasted little Jewess can be kept out of my mind I But wait till I fall in with her I that's all."', "Well, let us settle that bet. Neither of us has won, so we may asnwell putit about. Are you agree- able, Tommy?" "Yes, I am willing." So the stakes were delivered up to the owners, who each put in their share, and half a dozen of wine was called for. CHAPTER VIII. THEB ' SWELL MOB"TO PASS AWAY TIME GET UP A' "SPIELING"PARTY-A ROW BTl'WSWEIN THE "SHEENEY" "ANDLORD  AND THE GAR90N-ONE OP THE "' MOB" 'BECOMS DEAD BROKE--THE "FLY COPS"GET ON THEIR .TRACK AND THEY LEAVE FOR FOLKSTONE-- HOW THE LEADEB  OF ANOTHER "MOB"WAS "COP- rED" "DEAD TO RIGHTS"AND SENT TO "STUINZ " FOR TWELVB "MOONS3" The wine went round merrily that night, and it was not until an advanced hour in the morning that we be- gan to think of " cheesing it;" thensome went to bed, while the remainder got up a "spieling" party at ' French hazards,' and in the course of two hours our Joe, one of Fobb's " chums," and the landlord of the " drum," got" skinned" of every '" magi , they had with them.  This put an end to the night's career, and after a hard pull at the wine, we went out to take a bathe in the salt water. The landlord had been out on business the previous day, and had not returned until late in the night, when he was surprised to find no one of those whom he left in charge at home; for the garcon, after bringing in our half-dozen of wine, would " stall his mug" into a grocer's " drum" next door after the "slavey," and there stay until he thought we had got through the " lush," when he would return to serve us with another batch; and it' was during one of those tripsthe " bloke" came in and found his "  drum" in the hands of a company of Lon- don " gonnoff." Hisfirst performance was to run up stairs to his wife's sleeping-room;ithen through all the' rooms in the house, ibouting, *, Beckey-Rachael-- Beckey--Farcon/   My cotl vhere is my schildt- vhereismyschildtt You cot tam gcqrcon, garconi vhy you not pehint to par to mindt your pesiness, you tan fool Rachael,mycot vhere ish tem all?"-and in this strain he tumbled up and down and through the   whole house like a crazy man until the door opened, and in slid the garcon, terrified at the passion he saw the " sheeney," his master, in. As soon as he was inside the door, the " sheeney" ran at him, and " nailing'" him by the neck-tie, almost choked him, exclaiming, "Vhat vor you leefe my par, eh?-vhat vor you leefe T vhere ish my vhife and Beckey, eht How musch you take to-night, eh! The poor garcon hadn't the power to answer any of those questions by reason of the grip his master had of him, but he made a sign to the " sheeney" by point- ing towards the mirror, and there the " sheeney" no- ticed a small note, which he took and read, it being left there for him by his wife and Beckey. While read- ing it a pleasant expression took possession of his "mug," and at its finish he burst into a hearty laugh,  and ordering the garcon to go to bed, he joined our company and entered into all the fun of the night. We had a very refreshing bathe in the sea-water and returned to the " drum" for breakfast. On our way back Joe seemed rather " down-on-it." He had lost all his "sugar" at "hazard," and now he was reflecting upon it. We sat down on a seat on the pier, and Joe, while chewing a straw, seemed in deep thought. "How much for your thoughts, Joe?"I inquired. "How much for my thoughts? Well, I'll let you have them for a ' quid,' if you like," replied Joe. "Here's your money, then, and let's have them."  Being a " skinner," of course we would have to ad. vance sufficient funds for him to "graft" on any way; so that there was little or nothing lost by buying his thoughts. He" collared"  the "quid,"  and first put- ting it in his " kick," said: "Well, I was thinking how far I was away from Leeds and not a 'mag' in my ' kick,' and I feel blarsted wild with myself for being such a b-y ' mug' as to go and lose all my ' stufP with them fellows; and again, I was thinking that if I could only raise as much ' ceal' as would take me to Brightdu, I would go right there and ' dot that jeWeller's 'crib;' and now that I have this 'quid,' I'm bound for Brighton, and that ' drum' is going to be ' cracked, even if I have to do it by myself, and so I'm off by this afternoon's boat for Polkstone, and from there to Brighton." Jack and I tried to persuade Joe not to go to Brighton before we had made our tour through France, or, at least, to stay together and go as far as our "sugar" would allow us, and then begin to " graft" like beav- ers; and, in the meantime, what " sugar!' Jack and I had was at hi service. But this wouldnot satisfy Joe ; he wanted " sugar" very badly, but he only. wanted what he " grafted" for, and then he felt independent of every one. So, after an hour's unavailing persua. sion, we were obliged io let Joe have his own way, and off we started for the "sheeney," where we had breakfast, after which we got ourselves in readiness for our departure. During the day Fobbs and his paity were out at "graft" and " brought off' several "tricks," and at their return to the hotel, stood the "max," as is customary in all such cases, after which   we went to the bureau oni parpose to have oar pass ports made right; for It appeared that those we had at Caais were not sanuiont to pas- to Engaund, ex- cepting we returned by the Calais boat., So we had to sfiling' orer again ere we werepermtted-to leare for home. "Thi is la w conteY, I'm ws, to charge ,man money for comng to petd mo y0rWiththem, and then charging .hm tor not!Fving auymore to. leave with the huyng  frog-eaters I By heaven. let me once more get in England, and yon do t aget s  Joker com. ing to spend his ' sugar' amosr sh oh- b-y:eet." Joe's dander was up, for the tfoghts of the night's losing were uppermost in his mind. However, we got our papers and or wetwent to the " eeneygs" to bid good-byeoto Fobbs and We, "mob." When we got there neithere ither of that party wer i theho ae, nd upon inquiring of the " sheeaey," he said that they had left the house only about half an hour:before wo came in, and in an ndertone said that he thougit all wa not right, e. wefauired hW- reason for t Ung- t and after filling each a glS aid he n Sho Vhobs vhas gon der vhs vyon ow-don ' vhly, kop.' and- vho Boolony-! vhly kop' look ia- here and VSy,' .hre ish der koompanny vhat yhauh here ,t nd .I say, t  er ish no koompa nnsyhere, monsier-;' and I tell you vhat you do-go oter U fcf to!, AW'  Wehookhands lfth thpe heenw  and determie d to make ue of the Wnitlhe gave U8s nd, a( tmr:nother "facet"' we erach took a bottle to? on thO. ya,.and  started tfor theisteamer 'hat went to Fo-Letq,.

We felt rather reluctant inJoining in this opera. tion, for In the moset conspicuous parts of the building were posted large placards requnesting passengers to "Have an ey to yoar pockets-the I swell mob' are around." But as he presed very hard for us to join him, we consented. In a short time our luggage was handed to us, but we had to wait some time longer for the " fat," who had several trunsk, band-boxes, &c, to be inspected. At last. she appeared, arying in one hand a bonnet box, and in the other a travelling bag. She looked exactly the kindof a person to carry a good " stake, and ao thought Joe, ilthoughAie was a complete novfce in the dexterous art of " clyfaking,, " brsting", bein his "forte;" for in his eagerness to rsplenish his "kick," he was willing to hazard an opinion, whether to the point or not. While she was yet a few yards from as, Joe whispered in my ear: "Ain't she a rippert By heavens, what a ' kick' 1 fall of sugart she must carry, eh t How much will 1 you take foi yonr 'regs' (share) before it' trned c out?"  ' I had no opportunity of answering him, for Jat then : the office was "slung" to " close in ;'," and " pratting, b Joe being in front, along with Jack, so as to choke up the passage, or at least prevent a hasty exit from the buildfng, I  "stalled" the ', wire" in the rear? car-  rying his and my own travelling bag,one ineach hand , ready to push in between the " moll', and the ', wire,' it m  case ofa tumble Owing  to the bandbo she car- i sea fI her right " duke,*, the "dip" didn't come off  s80 quick as it otherwise wouald, which made the front "atalla" repeatedly turn their "muasM, " -wondering  why the "office" wasn't "slang" that it was off. a Whether *twas this looking round of theirs, or that she w then noticed the large placard, telling her, in Eriglish tu and French, to "Have an eye to your pockets-the I  'srwell mob' are around," I cannot Oay; but at that he moment she made an effort to take hold of that part di1 of her&-es where the pooket lay, and in doing so her yO hand came in contact with the "wire's dake."  or a ' e momentshe heoitated what to do, but the .' bag"f was Ut off; and seeing that there was a likelihood of a ' tn m eQ ble," I nntsvtly pressed myself between her and the 1 "wire," which gave him an opportuldity of " slinging, ,n the "  poke" to Jack, who was immediately in front of of as, at the same ttme-telling them all to " split," and ing Jack to "  namase."             fo We hd scarcely time to'get behind one of the public  carriages (wher He 'F ilg" the "C wire" his traveling. fac bag, and he rani'g himself by taking of his light bul traveling overcoat, -*hen two of the custom-house wa attendants hastily appeared, and tapping us on the ohs   a a shoulderasked as if te w old "please step thi pwl and a moment.

Seeing the moment of dew cision on our part had arrived, I turned to the person  a who had tapped us on the shoulder, and taking up my bag from the ground, said t "  Itis evident, sir, there is a mistake here; yet such often occurs on a Journey ;", thenturning to the lady, I  againdoffed my  e dady, and bowed myselfaway from her.

'pon our arrival in Dover we were made aware..of ithe fact, not only by seeing them in the railway s tation, but in the most fashionable resorts oftthe city.  This wasrather "hot," and did not'giVie'much aow of a chance for present "graft." So in my own mind I   concluded to renounce the " dip" while we remained in Dover.                   d As we proeceded along in the direction of Tommy ' Ka'ne', ofthe Boyalmortar, in Military row, where we a expected to meet Joe and Jack, our convereation ' turned upon the probable amount of "sugar" con- ' tained inthe " moll's poke."         t: "Well, I'll bet my life it's a stinger, for I ' piped' h one end of it crammed with ' pap,' when the ' moll h flashed' it in the Costom-house; besides, I could tell B by the feel, while I had it in. my ' duke,' that it was f 'rybck stuff.' Anyway, I wouldn't take twenty 'quid' a just now for my ' regs'-what do you say g"  t I answered that it was impossible to tell anything I about it at present; but as soon as Joe and Jack were 1 found we would then know to a certainty.   I "How long have you ' graftd' with those two?" he asked.                    s "Not very long," I replied. "Their game is differ- c ent to mine; but I know both of them well fotr some 1 years."'                   a "Did you ever suspect either of ' shaving' you while 1 you have been with them?"           a "No, I never did; but what makes you ask the ' question?" "Well, I don't mind telling you, for I know you o won't mention it again. You see I have been ' graft- ing' with Fobbs and Tommy for a long time, and oc- I casionally we take in Bob Coombs or Jim Batty when they want a ' run.' Well, a week or two back, Harry Clark and I were having a glass of ale together in Fred Hogg's, and Harry seemed rather down about something; at last he called me out, saying, ' Let us take a walk up the Walworth road, as far as the Horns, and have a game atrackets.' Iconsented, and ,n we started. I noticed there was something on his mind' and rallied him on it." "What makes you seem so dull, Harry?"- said I; "You look as if you were going to have twins. What is the matter?" "What's the matter 7" repeated he," Enough is the matter when a fellow gets chiselled out of the ' sugar' be chances his life for." "Whew I that's it, is it? Who do you think has s Bunk your regulars?' " A"Well, I don't want to say anything more about it just now, for fear he gets ' wind;' but by thunder I if I don't get level with the needle-pointing ' bloke' the first ' dummy' I ' pinch'-you see if I don't, No won- der they can buayhorses and cabs, and set up 'lush- drums,' the blasted hounds, when they ' weed' half of every ' poke' they get away with; but Harry don't Bling any more 'pokes' to that 'weeding' b --r, I'll bet a new ' castor' on that." "To what ' weeding bloke' have you reference to, Barry?" (' Why, to that miserly skin flint, Bob Coombs," said he. ,' But, are you certain 'twas he, or do uon only sus. pect him? I inquired.   "Suspect be d--d; didn't I see it in the ' hay' describing the several articles which were in the ' dummy,'- all exactly similar to the one I nailed, and at the same 'jug,' too, where the 'huey' says it was ' pulled.' After I ' pinched' ,the 'cole,' I ' slung' the ' dummy' to. Bob Coombs, and in he jamps .in acab tha-twas passing at the moment, and we never met him until the evening at the Elephant and Castle, when he' turned up' all that was ia the ' dummy,' as he said, but since the 'huey' came out this morning, Ii find that the lousey wretch has stuck to one hundred and fifty ' quid,' and I know it is no use saying any- thing about it just now, for he wouldn't admit it; but I want you to keep shady for a few days, and if I ain't level with him, may I be cureed. So60 don't you say a word." I promised to keep shady, and after a game or two we parted. Now, Harry's case was so similar to my own that I began to suspect every one. If it wasn't the fear of a "Jagging," I'll be d-d if I would "sling" another " ski/" to ere a "stall" what walks; for they are a meanset of useless creatures, any way, and can't be depended on. Now here is Fobbsa Tommy and I have been ' grafting," and pulling away "skins" by the dozen, as you may say; but ne'er a one turns up like they used to that is, none that Joe Fobbs has " slung" to him, turns out worth anything. I have seen heavier " bags'* gotten from the poor "molls" in the orange market in Dake's place than some of them that he " turns up ;" and yet look at the horses and cabs the fellow's goti Junst take a look ;at most of our "stalls," and see how well off the sneaking hounds are, compared with us unfortunate "wires!"There is Joe Fobbs, alias Wood, can boast of his omnibuses, his four-wheeled cabs and his " mob" of horses, and his princely furnished house. Where, or how did he get all thist Was it by his own "dulie"' ; this was gott Not by a great sight, for he never was ; able even to "pinch" a sprat from a gridiron; and it could not be by what he got as shares for " stalling for the dip," else the "wires" and other "stalls" ' whom he " grafted" with, would be equally as well off. No, sir ; all or most of it has been" weeded" from the  shares of those he has " worked" with. I don't think much ofhim as a "stall," anyway. He hasn't gotthe t appearance nor manner of a gentleman in anything he f says or does ; in fact, he appears to me the very model e of moneyed vulgarity, and in my opinion is fitter for * going round the race courses with his nut-basket, as L- he formerly did, than to associate with men who know f how to act as gentlemen, even if we are " gonnoffI." t I am tired of him, and don't mean to " graft" with him r, any more, whether he gets out of this scrape or not. As for Tommy, he can do as he likes. Then, again, , look at Bob Coombs. What did he ever do in the "' gunning' line to make him so rich as he is? Noth- d ing but" stalling" for the " dip," and when it came off, " weeding" it from the poor creatures, his " pals." i. He, too, can sport his couple of thousand, and if need be, live on the interest of this " sugar." It would-look   better if he would try to lessen the hardships of the poor " wire" lately " lagged" from him, and now out in Gibraltar "doing his time." But they don't care what becomes of a poor "pal" after he's " lagged." I heard that he has some ten or twelve hundred pounds belonging to the " wire," and refuses to send himany assistance, laying the blame on old Boozy Brown; but Brown denies it. There'sa Fred Hogg, again. What did he ever " pull" away? Not as much as would keep his nose clean-and look how well he's off? 'Tis well known that poor Jemmy GutsaIll was the means of putting him in the position ho now occu- pies; but when Jemm'sa " moll" came to Fred, asking for a little " sugar" to help Jem do his " lagging" at Woolwich Arsenal, he refused to contribute a " mag," although he got many a hundred pounds from Jem for "stalling" for him, besides what he " whippedi' when he got away with the " bag." "I could mention the names of many more," added he, "but I suppose you know them as well as I do. As for myself, I believe that for the future I shall ' graft ' on my own hook, and chance getting away with the ' bag,' for I can plainly see 'tis a losing game to have such bloody ' weeders' along with me at ' grai.:L'" I could see by this conversation that he felt uneasy about Jack getting away with the " ekin ;" but as I never knew Jack to do anything wrong in the " shav- ing" line, I ventured to bet that every " mag" would be " turned up rybuck."

We had now got to Tommy Rann's, at the Royal Mortar, Military Bow, and after placing our travelling bags in Tommy's charge, took dinner.

'S^   came alongside; it was from Ramagas, and pretty well crowded. Prom where we stood we could look , down upon the deck and see all that was going on.? We had not looked down upon the deck more than! three or four minutes when a sudden commotion took. place in the crowd at the gangway on deck, and isn stantly a voice screamed out: "Stop him, stop him, that man's got my purse.', "Which man?" cried Jemmy Nick (for it was he and the same " mob" we had left in Brighton prior to our visit to France). "Which man? point him out to me, Madam.'" "There he goes with the coat over his arm V" At this, Jemmy made a rush along the gangway in pursuit of the thief, and grabbed hold of a "flat" by the collar before he had time to step on shore. Hero he held him in a vicoeliko grip, notwithstanding the "flat's" indignant appeal to know the cause of such unbecoming conduct. "Ah, you'll know the canse of it too soon; I'm afraidl we've seen such gentlemen as you before; but you'il know all about it in less than a minute. Make way for that lady there, gentlemen," and Jemmy pointed down the gangway, but in consequenoo of the block- ade by himself and the "flat" at the top of the pas- sage way, no one below them could stir a foot from the position in which they were wedged in, until after repeated commands from-the Captain to "Clear the gangway; d-n your eyes, don't you see no one can get out while you two d-d fools choke up the en- trance"-then still holding the " flat " by tho. collar, the two stepped on shore, and the crowd, with a rush, gained the pier. Here the passengers formed around Jemmy and the "flat," the latter of whom struggled to be released from the hold taken of him; but 'twas no use, and only added to the impression already forming, that Jemmy held in his grip one of the Lon- don pickpockets-a " swell mob's man 1" "D-n him, hold him tight; he's the one. Don't let him go-where's a policeman V" etc. Soon the lady appeared and Jemmy was the first to speak: "   How much did he take from you, Hadam t" "He took all the money I had with me; it was in a long green purse-fifteen pounds, and ten or twelve shillings in silver." "Well, here comes a  policeman; you know what to:do now." The policeman appeared, and regardless of all the "flat"'could say, he was collared by the "bobbie," and with Jemmy and the lady in his wake, marched off to the'station-house. But, on the way there, Jem- my made an excuse to the lady whom he was walk- ing alongside of, that he had come away and forgotten his bag and must return to the boat for it, promising to be present at the search of the thief, in a few min- utes. However, as soon as he was out of sight of the "-moll," he made a  bco line for the noyal Mortar L rhcre he expected to meet his " mob." On his way there we made up to him, and he not knowing that we V   had been looking on at his performance, took off his "cady," and wiping the perspiration from his fore- head, said," Hll-ioal are youhere toot Have you seen the Scotch boy?g' (meaning Johnny Gilderoy, Ahe Scotch "wire i') "We've just ' dipped' a 'moll' coming out of the Ramsgate steamboat, and I thought Jack was going to get.' pinched,' and he would have been, too, for she ' beefed' terribly, only I ran after a ' flat,' Pd collared him instead of Jack. I kept the poor ' flat' at the end of the ,gangway long enough to give time to Jack to' get cut of sight before I let one of the whole boat-load get out,and now they have got the 'flat' in the ' boo'y-hatch,' but I expect they'll turn him up, for of coarse they can't find anything on him, and all he can I rap' to, is that he had a coat over his arm jast like the Sootch boy's. Bat come on in, and let as have a ' facer' of' booze,' for I'm dry as a whistle." In We went to a neighboring public house, and calling for a stiflener of brandy each,/had it to our lips when we overheard the words: "Well, now, I don't think from his appearance that he was the thief. I noticed two or three sharp-looking fellows together while I was on board, and that same fellow that collared the one that is charged with- the theft, was one of them. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to heat that he knows more about the lady's purse than he that's gone to the station house." "Well, I wouldn't wonder a bit either," replied the ither; " them d-d Cockney pickpockets beat every- thing, they say." Jemmy had the glass to his lipa when the first speaker began talking, and there it remained until the finish of the remark, when in a trice down went the brandy in his throat, and pulling his " cady" over his forehead, whispered: "Lotus 'namease;' this is a b--y sight too hot for me," and " slinging the bloke" for his t' lush" we C stalled' Tommy out of the " drum," and off we can. fered to the Royal Mortar. i' Upon our arival at the Royal Mortar we found Johnny G:lderoy, the Scotch " wire," anxiously aVait. ing the appearance of his " stalls, but still taking it comfortable alongside of a glass of hot brandy and one of Tommy's best havanas. We had hardly got seated E before Jemmy Rowsell and Ikey Rowe entered, and upon seeing their "wire" exclaimed: "Where the O  did yon ' namase' to at the break of the boat I We looked every where for you and couldn't ' spring' you. There was a ' bloke' right be- side Jemmy, and we ' slipped a dummy' fall of ' soft, and we couldn't find you anywhere. 'Twas a rank ' gift,' and nobody there to ' pinch' it." "And why the .--  didn't you ' pinch, it your- selves when you saw  sunch a gift?" replied Jemmy quick, who felt himself of superior consequence to the others, from his having saved the Scotch boy from be- ing "collared," and the only one excepting the " wire" who knew anything about the " stake" just come off. If you had been tending to your 'graft' you might ,-   s have donh, your share towards bringing off the ' bag' ! Johnny and I were so near being 'pinched' for. As a it is, rwe are all safe enough Just now, but by thunder it aint owing to anything either of you have done to. wards it." e  A few "jollies" on either side and Jemmy began to r collapse; then the "sugar" was "put about," and a after each man hbad received his "regs." " boozing,- I became the chief end in view. We were as before, I par excellence, allowed the sole use of the bar parlor ' of the Royal Mortar, and well it paid Tommy; for [ each strove with the other which should " stand" th9 most,- and before night sone of the best wine and rbrandy that ever crossed the Channel, a lacorraband, received a hiding-place more secure than any smug- ; gler's caveB My chum and I had become very uneasy on account of the absence of our " pals," and we be. gan to think something " crooked" had happened to them, and in consequence did not indulge in the frolics of the evening, as the other " mob" did; but- jast as our fears got to almost a certai-ty, in walked Joe and Jack, arm in arm, flushed in the face and smoking ci- gars as long as marling spikes. We were glad, of course, to see them again. But they were half " lushy," with a smile on their-" mugs," and such telescopic ci- gars denoted something extra: "How d'ye do, how d'ye do, Mr. Ferguson? how are you V" "The ' bag's off,' sir, the 'bag's off;'" aad slipping his "duke" into his "kicksies," he hauled out a "skin" pretty well stocked with "sugar," and slap- ping it on the counter two or three times, shouted out,. '"These don't grow on the tops of trees, eh I Talk about 'ungar,' eh What will ye take for your ' whacks?' " I could see that they had been '"lush- ing" pretty freely, and ".officed" them to keep a '"square mug," in case any of the "flats" in -the "drum"   might " tumble" to us, and with'a wink to Tommy, the landlord, we " stalled" our " mugs" into a private room, and after ordering a couple bottles of Tommy's best contrabantd, sat down to put the-" su- gar" about. 'There were eight ten pound notes on the Bank of England; thirty-five sovereigns, and some six or seven shillings in silver. We divided it equally, and after finishing our wine listened to Joe and Jack's adven- tures since the " tumble" in the Custom House. "Why, in the first place,-' said Jack, "I knew b-y well there was a ' tumble' from what you said when giving me the ' skin.' So I made as quick as I could to the centre of the town, keeping among the throng of' passengers walking along; for I was fearful of a ' pinch,' and didn't know what moment I was going to feel some one's ' duke' on my collar. But along I walked, cursing like blazes, the length of the pier; for I  wanted to get among some comers, but ne'er a b-y corner could I meet until I traveled the whole length of the pier-and by heavens that pier seemed to me miles in length; but at last I got to the end of it, and the first ' lush drum I met I ' namased' into it forthare   \  life; for I thought it was b--y' hot,' when ne'er a one of you could come near me all the way up from the depot to the town. Well, I called for a glass of ale, andwhile' the waiter was drawing it, I made for the I dunniken,' and, as fast as my legs would let me, ' turned out the poke.' I tell you I was not. long in 'diningng  the empty 'skin,' and turning over the ' stunf I found these eight tens, and such a b--y big pile of French 'sugar' in paper, that I didn't know ecarcely what to do with-it. At one time I thought of 'linging' it along with the ' skin,' but then I did not know what the value of it might be; so after considering a while, I made up my mind not to 'sling ' it; but I didn't much like the 'swagging' of the b- ' stff;' so when I had returned to the bar and drank I aked the waiter if he would take French money. Ie said, Yes; and I ' slng' him one of the papernotes: of French money, and he gave me a fistful of ' smash' in return for it. I thought this was doing, b----y good; and after another glass, I went out to look for one or other of yro, but ne'er a one could I find. So I   made my way to the railway station, and found the train, ad tarted, and that another would not leave for som-ehonrs after. While I was thinking what was best to do,: I hancsed to spy Joe, walking along as if he was lost, and so hqe was, but I was b----y glad to find him. Well, we went into one of ther largest hotels in the place, and having ordered dinner for two in a pri- vate room, I showed Joe all the 'sugar' I found in the 'skin.'t The French 'tuff' he knew no more about than myself, but we both thought it' cokum' to get rid cf it first; so when the waiter appeared, I 'slung' him one of the French bills. I didn't know whether it was worth a  crown or a shilling when I ' slung' it, but I I ,hanced it, and was pleased to hear him ask whether i I  wished English money or Prench in return  ' English, 1 if you please, I said, and soon he came back with the I smash' allin Englishmoney. I ' slung' him a shilling ' to ' sluice' his ' gob,' and he ' namaed' from the room t as ploased as Punch. "By the - , this paper turns out better than I had 8 any idea of," I said to Joe. "Suppose-you take some S of it, and I will go with you to some of the big ehops and -' lush drums,' and let us ' smash' it; for I don't W think 'twill be any use taking 'screens' of this kind 10 to the ' start' with us."           in Joe agreed, and in less than an hour we had a "  smashed" the whole of them, for they take them as al soon as any other money; but I  don't know whether in I got my right " smash" every time or not. Any way, b I  didn't care a curse, so long as we got something for ni them. Well, ir, whatdo you think? We hadjust got  through with the " stuff," when, as we were leaving al one of the hotels where we had " slung" one, what did oi we hear but a, b---y bell-man ringing out that a al "moll" had lost -her " poke" at the Customs depot, tic and giving a  description of the money that was in it, ni and that the parties who "  nailed" it were yet in the ge town. I   didn't much relish this bit of information, and to Joe felt the same. So we both made up our minds ,   34 a that ' nam aed was the order of the day, and off we Dm started for the statione but not a train would leave of for hours yet, Bso here we were in a pretty fix-the ror 'poke chat  and we what got it in the town, and ie, no get away. Besides, any one or all of the hotel in keepers and landlords of the ' lash drums' where wo he had 'smashed' the stuff,' might 'come it' on rs, ig and if wo were 'pinched' they were sure to 'rap' to w bothofUs. This wold not do so eap  "Joe,hero ht follow me," and offwe went to a livery stable, and In less than a twinkle I had hired a and brougham, pair, er post haste to Dover; and here we are, b-y glad to 'see you all again." With that, Jack gave the bell a -Y move, and when Tommy appeared, another round of k, B  smuggled stuwas ordered, brought in, and very i.. sooa disappeared. 8s We all felt pretty tol-tol by this time, cad as we had V no more busainess to transact together for that night, -YIw  made amove towards the dancing room inthe rear r ofthe building. lo or         CHAPTER XL. t THE "SWELL MOB' ATTEND   AT A DANOE--HOW TH!S ' "DRUM"KEBPER    WAS CAUGHT  WITfI A 3BILLSNfR d- MOLL"-ONE OF THE "MOD"MAKES LOVEM TO TH!E "ANDLADY OF THB "ROYAL MORTAR"--HB IS DBo- TED BTY nIS "PALL"AND   THE LOVEs BECOM!N ALARMED-HOW  THE "ANDLADY"  GOT "KIDDID" BY THE "GONNOFF"--THE   PROP0SITION TO ELOP2, , SHOWING HOW JOB GOT "SWEET"WITH THEB " MOLL..' The dance was going on briskly at the rear of the [ house, and during the time occupied in "putting tho r sugar about," belonging to the lost "dip," those beo- , longing to the Scotch boy's "mob" had selected part- , ners, and were already on the floor, showing off on the "Iight fantastic toe." Our "mob" were seated at a table at the farther end of the room, and kept the waiter pretty busy, running to and fro with orders. Soon our party were enlarged by the addition of the Scotch boy's "mob," who-" like birds of a feather" -felt more at ease among their own kind. Tho wine went round at railway speed, and Tommy Bann, tho landlord, was putting money in his purso at a pleas- ing rate--each bottle costing five shillings, and half a   dozen the number asked for at each order. We were all flush of " sugar," and all flushed with wine, includ- ing the landlord, whom we made drink at every order brought in. We were all bent on a good epreo that night, and each vied with the others in doing Iheir utmost to see it through. Among those who ca'lcd in at the Royal Mortar for their " bingo," were Et veral officers belonging to the military, stationed in I)ovor, and, as we afterwards learned, one of them took a par- ticular fancy to the hostess, Mrs. Bann. She was a nice, free-and-easy, good-looking woman, and, alto- gether, as virtuous as her lord and master, and mone so, too; gta as yet Tommy had never "  collared " her be 1...- ,- Mhile, in hid case, once she was bronught to   fL, iasaing drum" down town, and there, while wa-msrvas yet asleep, " pinched him dead to rights" ht"s daoss, with a pretty milliner girl,-who used to PAtN+o tHe Royal Mortar as a "' square" girl on ball hif.* This flare-up was but a short time previous asaM arrival, and possibly was yet rankling in the -  dlaaa o of our pretty hostess who, with the idea that slai in good for the goose is good for the gander," -flbsed to " play off" on the first opportunity. -I had ,iaeds Joe leaving the dancing room in, a, stealthy irasmar every time Tommy brought our orders, (for ,f Musny waited only upon us, the "'pot boy" doing the sw tm waiting), and returning in time to see the land. Al&GXceaut again, I wondered what it meant, but ,. Baisstt " tumble'" to it just then i but after a while, 'ka itivas kept up, I resolved to "pipe Joe off,"  laittlhere was anything on the board worth having, aider iff myself. The wine was notlong kept on the fti cer in the bottles. either, for by this time the ^aam" l-whom we danced with and the "'fiatties' round S-fctom, were treated to as much as they could put ramy, and some of them could do that same in Tem- *t ktime. Every one there that night, according to abmy'ia statement, was a fine fellow, whether he had s  hffik-m before or not, and upon this recommen- 6(i^n: he was welcome to the "booze" on ourtable. -1^,it not been the,' Tommy would have taken less' 'fRsteWr" than he did. He was no ' mug.' Ve. had sent the landlord on another wine expedi- le-aand immediately on his return to the room; I aed" -Joe ," stalling"' his "mug" from among -us. 'Wipo 1, my fine id,'" said I to myself, "I must ave atlnd in this. There's something on the carpet, else iwonldn't be ltrching around at this rate," and out cTed myself unknown to the others, who were em- qgayed, some in dancing, some still " boozing," and aers "pratted" beside "square (1) molls," endeav. atg to "kid" them over to their purpose. There Aw a long passage-way from the'bar to the back of tr house; where the dance was kept, and to the right Agle dance-room door was a private path leading to t',tne in the rear of the house. I knew not which ;aWr Joe had taken, and was considering what to do, -Ven I heard the slow creaking of an inside door in '.th passage way between the bar and where I stood. CAh, ha I now I have you my boy," and by the 'fht of -the bar I could see a person pass through and stioualy close the door after him. I quickly followed, 4 to prevent the door creaking, I untied the rope oralefE the iron weight on the ground. I slowly and :3telessly moved towards the bar, and there, one on morh side, hand in hand, stood our Joe and the pretty iLad y of the Royal Mortar, in close confab over the A(smter. "Oh, ho I this is yBur game, is it, doing the Odowa on .your own hook, eh t What a cheek our Joe ;*la, and he scarcely five minutes out of Yorkshire!" 3rkB 1 must keep ' shady' a while, and ' pipe this off.' Abm where I stood I oould see all, and occasionally [wsr a few words. - NEo, I'll not promise just now, if you'll wait in   Doftr a ioew weeks'until there is more money in the house, and if he then ill uses me as much as he has done, I'll let you know what I'll do." "Oh, I don't care about the money; I have enough for both of us. How much do you think he has in the house just now, anyway?" asked Joe. "Well, I don't think there, can be over one hundred and fifty pounds at present, for only the other day he had to pay the brewer,and yesterday he settled a bill for some wine and brandy, brought over'fro FPrance." "Let's see," said Joe; " one hundred and fifty, and what I have got, will makeust" --  At that moment the bowl of the meerschaum I was smoking came apart from the tube andifell noisily on the floor; the two started, and quietly drew their hands apart; then, in a second, the cigar box was laid on the counter by the "' moll," and Joe, picking out one, laid the "posh" down, and it was swept into the till. This attempt to "square" things -came too late; they were " bowled out," and so was I. But for the life of me, I could not help bursting into a laugh at the comical predicament we were all in-the "m moll" with her eyes starting with amazement and fear, looking to Joe for an expla- nation of the sudden Interruption; Joe with his cigar, the wrong end in his mouth, timidly peering into tho shade for the cause of the noise; and myself bent nearly double with the attempt I made to suppress  the tittering that immediately broke out upon the fall of my pipe, leaving the tube firmly clinched between my teeth. This lasted but a few moments, and while I was sornmbling for the bowl on the floor Joe took courage, and advancing, took me by the collar and hauled me to the front of the bar. "What the -- was you 'doing there " said he. "Ear-wigging, eh?  A pretty b--r you are,I'm sure; I thought I left you inside ' lushing' along with Tommy and the rest, and here you are at my 'prat' doing the ' wig' all the time 1" This was said by Joe in a half pleasant sort of a way, for I knew from the first that he wouldn't care much, even if he did catch me '" piping" him. In fact he told me afterwards that, could he have spoken to me about the affair, and got me to come out without the others " tumbling" to it, he would have done so. As for the " moll" of the " crib," I was allright with her, for I had used the house everytime I had been in Dover, and at that moment she was wearing a " ridge thimble"I had sold her upon a former visit to the town. After wiping the tears from my eyes, brought on by the fit of laughing I juat had, I called for some "booze,"' and-the three of us enjoyed ourselves at the counter, until hearing suddenly the musai, we knew the dancing-room doorS must have opened; and in case Tommy might be the party coming, we swallow- ed our " max" and slid out of the front door. As soon as we got to the street, Joe took me. by the button- hole, saying: A"What a bloody fool you must be to make that noise in the passage, junst at the time, too, that I had almost 'kidded her to namase with me."   "Namae-with you, did you say ' 1 asked. "Why, yes; 'namase' with me; but stop, and I'll teUl you all about it. Soon after going into the room to night, and while you and Tommy were ' lushing,"' ' piped' a good-looking little 'moll' sitting opposite to me, and the ' fogle' she had thrown over her shoulders looked rather seedy. I took a fancy to the little piece, and the thought struck me if I only had one of those new ' fogles' with me, which are in the ' bag,' I would make her a present of it, and perhaps I would loose nothing by it. So out I slid, and rnaking my way to the bar, just as I got to the spot where I 'collared' you 'ear wigging,' I ' piped a good-looking soldier-an of- ficer, I think, he was, by the way he was rigged- leaning over the counter and skylarking with the moll' oftho-urm.1  could tell from the way he looked at her and she at him, that something was up between them; so I kept cool, and ' ear-wigged' the same as you did. After talking some nonsense between them, and just as he was about to leave, he told her to lean forward, as he had something to whisper to her. She didn't stop to be asked twice, and over she leant her'nat,' and my bold officer grabbed her by the ' chops' and gave her a rousing kisslt Thinks I, my lady, two can play atthat game; but I knew. I stood a cursed poor chance as long as the officer ' bloke' was 'rybuck' there, So, to put the crab on my gentleman, I boldly stepped out from my comer, and putting on a look, stared him smack in the face. He'l make a h- of a soger, he will. What do you think the frightened b --r did 1 He turned as red in the ' mug' as a pri- vate's coat, and hastily ' colloring' his cigar, turned round and left like a sheep. Won't he make a brave eoger, eh-? Well, as soon as his back was turned I put -on another look, and looking at the 'moll,' who seemed dreadfully scared and afraid, I suppose, that I would blow to her ' bloke' about what I had seen, said, ' Don't be afraid of me, Mrs. Rann; what I have seen and heard will not be told to your husband, provlding you do two things I will ask you.' ' Oh, for Heaven's sake, don't mention it to him; young man, and I will do almost anything you ask me to; for look here and see how he has illMused me already,' and she drew back her head dress showing me where Tommy had 'hackled' the 'fleece' from her ' nut.' It was only the other evening I caught him in bed along with a girl who came here to dance, and becaae I blowed him up abont it he beat me terribly; and it isn't the first time he has done these things sinoe- I married him. But I will soon leave him altogether, for I can't put up with such treatment. You won't tell him, will you?' 1 thought of ' kidding' her a bit, for I saw she was com- ing to the point I wanted to get her at, and said, ' Well, Mrs. Rann, he ought not to ill-use you, that's certain. and he can't be much of a man that would do so; but if I were in your place I wouldn't live with a man that laid his fingers on me to hurt me. There are plent; of good men in the world who would be glad of such a pretty wife as you are, and they are eaey enough tc be found, too, but not, as a general thing, among the   sogers.' Ti ast word made her wine a triple, and beginning where she had left of, she repeated, ' But you won't tell him, will you?' ' Well, promise mo the two things I ask of you.*' What is it 1' said she. ' Lean over and I'll tell you,' said L With that she put her ' mug' close to mine, and I whispered, ' Have nothing to do with that soger fellow for the future, and let me take a kiss to bind the promise.' I did not wait for a refusal, but ' copped' a sweet one right from the ' gob,' and from that moment I knew everything was ' rybuck' between her and me." "Well, cut it short, Joe; I want to get back to the dance," said I, for I knew when Joe started a conver- sation concerning women, he was all there, and no one had a chance for a ary. "Well, blast my eyes, can't you hold on a bit until I tell you all about it, or if you are in such a b--- y hurry for damping about in that steaming hot room, go." I didn't want to crab Joe, so I answered, "Lat', have it then, Joe, but don't spin it out so b----y long; we'll catch cold after leaving that room If we stay out here much longer." "Catch h-. Listen. Well, after I had ' emotched' her, I called for a small bottle of wine, and when she placed it on the counter I told her to put two glasses there, for I waa going to stand treat on our new ac- quaintanceship. So up went the two glasses-.and 9& tell you she can put away her ' max' like a good 'un. I think she had been drinking before I ' copped' her with the '*wad,' for she soon began to show it in her ' mug' and in her ways. Well, as I was paying, the small bottle soon got empty, and I was Just on the point of calling for another, when we heard the music, and she knew somebody was coming from the dancing- room, and for fear it might be her ' bloke,' she asked me to go outside for a minute or two. I did so, but it wasn'tlthe.' bloke,' however. Thinkinghe mightsoon be out, I told her I would return to the dancing-room, and would be back before long. It was herself that told me to como as soon as the ' bloke' got back with the orders. "Well, Joe, what about that ' sugar' you and the ' moll' were ' cracking' about when I was ' ear-wig- ging' in the passage t Let me know of that." "* Well, that's the thing I am trying to get at both ways, don't you see, but you won't give me time. ' Rome wasn't built in a day,' was it  No," I replied. '! Well, then, neither is this!bloke's sugar' to be had in a minute. If his ' moll' is going to ' namaso' away from him, as she says she will do, why the -- can't it be with me, I want to know t She's a good looking ' mqll' and would suit me to a T, and I might as well have the ' sugar' she means ' namasing' with, as for eome b---y I flat' to get it, don't you see." "Well, Joe," I replied, "I don't want to have any, thing to do with this job. I know Tommy wel, and he knows ma and all tho ' mobs' that come to Dovcr from the ' start.' He has always been ready to help a   ' gun' when in need. It is only a few months back that one of the Whitechapel mobs' was ' working, downhere, and one of them took sick while in Tommy's ' orib.' He didAnt turn him out. No,he hired a nurse for him, -and paid for a doctor's attendance all. the while he was ick, and when the poor fellow got well, ho gave him enough to pay his fare to London. BeSides, he is very handy in standing for a thing. I can't have anything to do with it." "' Well, I don't want any one to have anything to -do withit," replied he, "I can do it myself. I'm no kid ;' besides, she'sa swest on me, and I am the same on her; and if I don't 'collar' her, that soger ---r or somebody else will. Let us go in and have a drink.' In we went, and calling for a small bottle of wine, I tasted with Joe and her and left them together at the' bar.  When I returned 'to the room, I noticed that another dose of six bottles' were on the table, and Tommy in a rather shaky condrition, and too far gone to notice I had been absent froin thoe room. Owing to the plentiful supply of Customs that Tom- my was having, the dance was kept up to a very late hour, in fact until there were only five or six fady partners left, the others having gone home; and one met at a time being rather too slow a coach, it was pro, posed, and agreed to, that we adjourn to the large parlor and finish the night's spree withtinging, where- upon a rush waS made for the possession of the few remaining "molls" left, and as luck had it, each of the "guns'" secured a prize, and with the exception of one, all the I flats" in the room marched minus a Jady to the parlor. Assoon as all were seated, Tommy received the usual order to bring in half a dozen of his French best, and no "bloody flies,' an order quickly attended to by Tom's waiter, who had been r "colloring his lush" all the evening on the dead-head system. There were two large tables in the room, and at one of these were seated all the "guns" and their  "molls," while the other was occupied by the ' fiats," E one of whom had alongside of him the little piece Joe had his eye upon, during the former part of the -I evening, and for whom he had gone to getthe " fogile b when he' "piped" the 'mioll" of the ' drum'" slky- larking with the " soger." The "flats" were, by tis e time, pretty wen corned, and rather noisy, like our- i selves, and when the motion was made for a song, two t or three at once volunteered, and in their hurry to be heard struck up together in different " Ohants," there-  by making such an infernal discord that Tommy, the T landlord, had to interfere and request them to sing one at a  time, or to allow the gentlemen opposite to do so. This request of Tommy's was immediately ," ruffed in" g by our side, and determined to have itall ur own way, h we instantly elected Jemmy Nick chairman of the to meeting.                   to Having, after much wrangling and distubance, got al thus far, Jemmy called on the honorable Mr. Ikey tt Rowe for a  starter. Ikey at once " doffed his cady,l, en   ck and forking his "' duke " through his curly hair, g' " hbolted a stinger," and began, S  "While thie lads of the village shall merrily-(3) h"e.  Sound the tabor, I11 hand thee along,^, etc. I, But in the second verse, whether it was in consequence n. of the generous Use he had Flade with Rann's best X Fiench, or want of memory in some other way, poor Ikey broke down, and the " fiats" (who seemed to be banded together,) broke out in a roar of laughter at 3 his misforiune. Ikey had a " moll" by his side, and ;' to be laughed at in her presence pricked him sorely ; r; and although none of the most valiant of " buffers" at "r any time, he could not brook this insult. So starting to his feet, he seized one of the, wine bottles, and with , lightning speed hurled it among the " fiats."  e "Take that, you b--y hounds; I'll leakn you how to ,t insult a gentleman, you hungry set of 'mooching' d ab- s, and if that don't satisfy yoe, I'lfcome over and e kick the b-y lot ofyou. Here, nick, hold my. coat."' Of counre there was more uproar than before, and in the midst of it Joeoslid in, and "collaring" the little piece before mentioned, who till now had been sitting along with one of the-" flats," edged her in among the other "molls" sitting along with uw, and "pratted" ehimseif beside her. She seemed well pleased with the ' exchange she had made, and in the confusion the "flat" had not noticed it. "Keep on your 'tog,' you b-y  'silliken,' , an. F swered Jemmy, in a loud-tone; , Do you want to get a  b-ygood -'muzzling ;, ocw, if you do, they'll let you have it if yon go out there. Don't you see they are all stuck together? You lick the whole lot of , them  Here, on with your ' tog;' they'll soon -pa. mase,' anyway, and then we'll have the ' molls' and all the fun to ourselves. See, Tommy is getting them right again." Whatever Jemrmy said to Ike was'law. They had "stalled" together in the same "mobs" for years, and anew each other perfectly. 80o Ikey, who really had no intention of going into the " buff" himself when he saw that no one was ready to "  slag" for him, quickly drew on his " tog," and muttering his bravado loud enough for his 4' moll" to hear, he seat- ed himself beside her, and filling .cut two bumpers, the pair drank to a better acquaintance with each other. There had been no damage done in throwing the. bottle among the "flats," it having struck the wall over their heads y so by much persuasion and promises of plenty of "  Irsh if they kept quiet, Tommy succeeded in getting them to bo seated again. The "   lush" was sent round as before, although Ikey growled a   little about letting them b---y ," shiser pal in" with us on the " lush tack ;" he thought they had had enough for "  nix." But there was a purpose to be gained which Ikey was not  , fly to." This was to get the "  flats" so " lashy," that they would be un. able to interfere when we arose to see the girls to their homes, for some of them were well known. to each other, and, as a matter of course, expected this   sweet privilege themaesuex. The reason why IkeJ was kept in the dark on this matter was, he was such a8 rink " iasfingtn' yand " gaser" we dared not con- fide any secret to him, for, whife under the inflaence or" barley*orn, he was a likely s not to . blow gUts" to any one who sat near him; and again, he had been so much earlier on this game than either of us, that he was now about played out, and almost a "shier', in the '" molling" laie; so we thought 'twas besttolet him " lush" his fil, and afterwards "sneak" his "moll' and " whip" her on to Joe, who we had noticed was standing at the bar as we came through from the dancing roqn to the parlor. I was anxions to hear how Joe had got long with his ".kidmentif with grs,. Rann, but he being seated at the end of the table farthest from me, I was obliged to watch for an opportunity to "collar his "o le'" and telegraph what I could not speak. He "copped"' my meani ng, and replied by a cull of the lip and a quick upward jolt of the-head, which signified "shie." I was glad of it, and hoped that something had or wuld pat a ocrab on that "pitch," for Tommy's sake. Things were by this time more settled, and Tom bandedround the " lush" for the dfiats ' as quick- as they could drink it,while we attended to the wants of our own table. It was not long-before the six bottles were, again emltied, and it being about time Joe ishould "1sail in," Jemmy hitedaas much, and Joe or-  dered another-round. Tommy soon appeared, and after " oellaring'" the "'sugar" from Joe' came lose up to Nick, who'was sitting belide me-his i' moll" on the other Bide-(not his lovely Polly, who "muz. zled" him in the Artichoke), and whispered: Does that young fellow belong to your ' mob ' " t: (meaning Joe). "No," said Jack; he belongs to that other ' mob.' I Didn't yon notice him with them the other day before E they left for France? He's one of them; he's all  right.'"  "All right or not, he oughtn't to ' Insh" my wife as t he has done. She's lying in the bar-room now as al dounk as blazes, and I don't like it."  "Oh, well I all's right, Tommy ; he's only up from I no the country a short time, and he don't know much. h 'Tis their way down there in Yorkshire, and he wants to spend some ' Sugar' as well as the rest of us. Come, fill out and let us drink. My sweetheart here is going to oblige ns with a song; ain't you, dear?" Tommy   filled out again and -handed round, after Ti which Jemmy aalled the company to order, and said that aslady would oblige with a song. Jemmy untied her bonnet stringa-to give her more vent, and after X "whipping" his arm around her waist, she started off in the highest imaginable squirl:  "Oh, a maiden I was at the age of sixteen (she was twice that age at least), Proni my parents stole away and a soldier I became i 'listed in th= o. ......Y d a^soldier I became  I 'listed in the army, where soon I had great fame I 4oPr Cthm- learned me to beat upon the row-dedow. de  Mo ^ryden edm mote  p0?^         oti   Lkey "Well, that's a b--r of a sog, a nd a it- Ydght uch worse singer.,  "For goodness' sake, get her to con- ' cheese' that infernal squalling,, I would sooner nce hear a sow sing than listen to her."

But the flats" were in ecstases over s the performance, and t the end of ev ry verse rap- lad turouslyapplauded it. "Go it, Peg." "That's tht la  ir for my money., t, Le t 'em see what you can do," igh &., t. ,t", The song was as long as a history, and when at last h it did terpninate, such yelling and thumping on the he tables wasnever before heard, Nick, for the sakoe of ph the fun, joining in with the "flats" at the .vors. When the hoise had abated puflciently to be heard, rd Jemmy, as chairman, called to order, and asking every glass to be filed, proposed a toat. When all were ready Jemmy gave, "Here's to the long life andsuc- cess of the beautiful young lady who so charmingly sang the last song." .Tommy's  best French" wa m telling Its strength now, and before another ten min- o8 ute', some of the " lata" were a! ble to sit erect in of their seats, while others weree seeking the table and s using it as a pillow. Two or three of our own lquad e were in nearly a similar condition, but those of us who ' kept our 'ys pepled watched over them, and before d long ovur party, including the girls, had the atir to e ourelves. Now was the time to " amasr," and the offide". being given, Jeremy proposed that we shorid end the evenings amusement by escorting the ladies to their homes. This was carried without a dime' ' tient voice, then each proceeded to don their ap parel, and ere many minutes the two London ", sr ell ' mobs" (with the exception of Ikey Rowe and Jemmy ; Rowsell, whom we left under the care of Mr. Ran-- I - they being too " luhy,'to stand-were promenading the streets of Dover " molled up" to their hearts, con. tent. Where this couple or that couple went, soon after leaving the Royal Mortar, was a mystery to the others; but certain it is, when the "guns" met again no one knew anything further than what concerned himself of that morning's proceedings., CHAPTER  XII.

It was late in the day ere we all met in the Royal Mortar; and although there was a big thing comina oDff that night at the " gaff," none of us seemed in:]i;;,   ed to get ready for f graft." As key remarked, " the Bteel seemed so be taken pretty-rell out of every one of ua." So, by' common consent, "grafting" was "cheesed" for that day. Tommy had drawn a good sam that night from the two " mobs," for each of us (with the exception of Joe, who only paid for one half-dozen) " slung" for two half-dozen of wine at five shillings per bottle-three " quid" per man. But then we had plenty of fan for it, and none of us seemed to regret it, barring Ikey, who said, "He could have a great sight more ' lash' in ^the ' start' for less money." We passed that evening away in playing at cribbage tot drink and " sugar" until Tommy made his appear- ance towards eight o'clock, none but the pot-boy be- ing In the bar till that time. Upon making his show among us he seemed to be about as much baked up as any of us, and not in the best of humor; but after a glass or two his temper altered, and calling Jemmy Nick into his bar-parlor, again questioned him regaid- ing our Joe, stating that, upon his going to his bed, room, he found the mistress lying at her length upon the carpet, and unable to answer him; bat by-and-by she " let the cat out of the bag" before she got sober enough to know what she was saying: "I'll let you know I'm not going to stay another day in this house; my money got it, and What there is in it is mine, and I'll take it with me. I have one now that will take care of me Instead of abusing me, and I'll leave you forever by the next train." "She kept on at this rate for some time," said Tommy to Nick, " and at first I took no notice of what ehe said, thinking it was only the drink that was talking, and after a while went to sleep, leaving her lying on the carpet; but a few hours after I was awa- kened by the fall of something, and looking round I found my lady dressed ready for starting off. Some- thing told me that there might be more than nonsense in what she was saying while lying on the carpet. So, jamping out of bed, I ran to the door and locked it, taking out the key; and turning round to her, asked her where she was going that she was dressed up so? She replied that she was not going anywhere in par. ticular, but only for a walk. I then went to the drawer, and upon opening it found that about one hundred and sixty pounds I had there had been taken from it. I taurned on her and asked where the money was. She said she knew nothing about the money; but just then I noticed the end of a long purse sticking out from her breast. I snatched it froim her, and she strug- gled to regain it. In doing Bo she fell and struck her face against the drawers, and now she has a black eye and threatens to complain to the magistrate about me, and I know if she does so she can hurt me, for she knows of several ' things' I've run' from the other side (France) lately. What do you think I ought to do?" "' Well, Tommy, you lick me now, for in snouh asea I don't know what to do myself. Why, look'ee here, air; 'twas only a few nights back that my flxmcr came near to makimg a ' tiff'un' o' mo in the ArUt   choke *- Brighton. She I collared' a pint pot and let me have it right on the 'nut,' while I was dancing wi' Betty Bignell wot keeps the I dossing 6rth' there. But I bet my lifo she got a' sickener' for it., But wot's : the reason that you and her fall out so t When I was down here before, you and her seemed to be as happy as doves, and nowthe wants to ' namase' from you." "Well, Jemmy, I'll tell you what I think is the cause of this. There's a young fellow of an officer stationed here, and both of them went to the same school, and were brought up together. Lately he has begun to come here, and I believe she makes too free with him; and because I check her about it, she cries out that I abuse her. Another things since he began coming here, she has taken to the ' booze,' and drinks over the bar along with him all the time he stays here. I didn't notice him last night; but Sam, the waiter, says he saw him drinking at the bar, and that after he left, that young fellow in the other ' mob,' was laushing her all the night. I know there is something up, else she wouldn't have taken the money from the drawer, and I wan't you to tell me if you know of any understand- ing between that young fellow and her. If you do, I would like you to let me know, and I'll do as muoh for you." After a little further conversation, Jemmy left, Tommy promising to post him if anything was up be-. i tween Joe and the " moll." Niok and I,being on very good terms, he concluded to " sound" me in regard to this matter of Tommy's, thinking that i there was any- thing on the board I would be " fly"r to it, being Joe's "chum." I at once told him all I knew of it, and that I was glad Tommy had " collared" the *" sugar" from the "moll," as that would prevent any run-away on Joe's part, he being as much taken up by the " sugar" in view, as by anything else, and, of course, not likely Ito "namase" with the "moll" without she brought the" stuff' along with her. Jemmy at once called Joe outside, and told him that Tommy had suspicion of him and the " moll" going to " namase," and that he had "bawled out" the whole affair, and " muzzled" the "moll" on his aocout. "That's a big lie, you know; you can't ' kid' me to believe that he ' muzzlel' her on my account, for that's his game two or three times a week, at least she says so, and I've seen the marks on her head where he 'skull-dragged' her a few nights ago for, speaking to an offier over the bar. She says he's Jealous of every one that speaks- to her, and if you only heard ialf what she ' cracked' to me at the bar last night, -you wouldn't blame her for wanting to 'namase' from him. But I don't care at all about 'namasigrg' with her; I can get a ' moll' anywhere, only I thought that the sugar' would be handy just now; but if she's 'bawled out' and the ' sugar blewed,' that puts a ' crab' on the whole of it, and I'm off out of Dover to- morrow morning. But you needn't put the ' bloke fly' that I know anything about the affair, and you mark my words if she isn't a ' namaer with that of. I fler before loug. I know she intends to leave him   soon, for she is ' sweet' on almost any one who will 'nam' with her from this 'bloke.' She is tired of him." Jemremy returned to the landlord and said that he was bare our Joe meant no harm, and that our "mob" were going away in the morning, at the same time hinting that the officer was the only one he need keep his eye peeled for. This news about Joe put Tommy in a better temper, and by-and-by all went on seem- ingly as before. Next morning we got ourselves in readiness to leave Dover, and before parting with the Scotch boy's "mob," we all took a hearty " lash," drinking suc- cess to each other's undertakings. The other " mob" were bound for Southampton, and ours, as we had a job in view, turned our " mugs" in the direction of Brighton ; for Joe felt determined to " do" that jew. eler's if there was only half a chance left. The "chum" that we picked up with upon leaving France, and who belonged to Fobb's " mob," wished to "pal in for good" with our "mob," but Joe felt averse to his admission, there being plenty in the "mob" just then for all the " graft" that was being done. "Bat look'ee here, Joe, don't you see that when we get to any place or station where there is a ' push,' a few lucky ' dips' aint to be sneezed at, and in case there was any help needed when" doing' a ' burst,' another hand in might be of great use; so that by taking him into our ' mob,' we get some one ofuse to us. See how lacky his first ' dip' turned out to be at the depot in Folkstone. That was a good beginning, wasn't it?" "It was very near having a bad ending," replied Joe; " and anyhow I don't believe in the ' dip.' It's all very well for them what is brought up to it; but give me the 'burst' before anything else. There is more ' sugar' to be made at it, and there is a great sight more fun in it than any other game I know of; and as for myself, I don't mean to, graft' four-handed. You may do as you like." It was no use trying any more on that point4 and af ter a treat round, the young fellow took his departure and started for London, while we otruok off for Brigh- ton. We were not long in getting to our journey's end, and in case we might be " piped off' by some of the "fly cops" that at times dropped into houses they knew " crow coves" to put up at, we steered right into the hotel at the front of the terminus. By so doing we then would be in readiness to jump off in any train starting, in case of a " stink."- We gave our bags to the porter and ordered dinner, after which we strolled through the town and down to the beach. The Parade is a fine street, running along in front of the sea, and a great promenade for visitors to Brigh ton. It was in this street the jeweler's shop waas itu- ! ated, and towards there we sauntered. As we passed the shop we took a passing " granny" at its contents, wendering how much of what we saw would be in our posRoion by the morning-for Joe   promised it should be done that night it at all poisible -and each calculated the dimensions of his ' kicks" and the amount they would hold. Joe was in the rear, and along with other visitors to the town, stopped at the window to look at the articles exposed for sale, while we walked on; and having gained the corner of astreet, we waitedfor him to come up. He soon came along, and the first words he made use of, was to in- quire, "What will you take for your 'regs,' boys?', There was a pleasant smile on his "mug" which seemed to say thateverything was lovely. "Will you take two'century' a piece, eh? But some in here, I have something to say that will please you," and in we went to a "lush drum," where we found a room with no one in it but ourselves. After the landlady had brought us our hot gin and water, and " namased" from the room, Joe proceeded to inform us of what he had noticed while standing at the window of the jew/ eler's shop: "While I was looking in at the window, the same ' bloke' that spoke to me about the repairing of the ' spper' when I was in there, came to the window to get an article for a customer that was in the shop. I thought once he had caught my ' mug,' but he, wasn't quick enough, for I instantly 'stalled' behind a lady that was looking in, and after he left the window I took a better ' granny' of the fastenings, and what do you think, my boys?" said Joe, slapping his " dukes" on the knees of Jack and me," What do you think I 'Tis the easiest gift I've ever seen yet-scarcely any ' graft' to be done before we're inside. Now, listen. I Next to the window of the shop there is a private door leading to the rooms above. Well, I took a ' granny' at the lock, and we can fit it easily with the 'things' we've got in the bag. Well, after we get in- side that door, all we have to do is to make an en- tranpe through the partition that divides the shop from the stairs. Do you ' twig, eh And after that, when we are inside one of us must go to the door of the back room and plant himself there, in case whoever, there he might spring out on us while at I graft' among the 'stuff.' In that owe the fellow must be ' ned- died,' no matter who he is, and that before' he can give ' beef ' too. So you see it is quite a simplejob to getin, if we only work it right. What do you think- ain't ita ' gift?,' "Yes, I should think it is a ' gift,' and a rank one at that, if it is just as you say; but don't you think that the ' bloke,' or whoever it is, will hear us from his room at the end of the shop?" "Well, we've got to chance that, the same an any- thing else; but if h don't hear us before we get in, I'm not so badly soared about all he can do after, that ti, if I'm posted at his door. I bet he'll not hol- loa twice if I can help it." "Bat you don't mean to say, Joe, that you'd ' croak' him if he trys to g8ve the alarm?"I inquired, rather undecided how to act on this statement of his. t' No, I don't mean to say that I intend taking his life; but if he ' Cools' me with the intention of stick- f"*   ing to me, I consider it to be 'my game' to get oatofit it the readiest way I can, and what is readier than a "neddy" just thent And if he don't leave go with one clip, why then he must Bave two, and so on th he does leave go. It's Ms business to know when he has got enough; 'tie mine to get away." This seemed to me a pretty hard kind of logic, and I began to wish the affair over and done with. What if, while standing sentry over the room door, some one from the inside should awake, and hearing a noise rise and open the door to find out the cause I What if, at that moment, the thief on watch, to prevent an alarm, should fell the poor victim to the ground with a blow from his " neddy!"It would of course silence him for the time being, and allow us opportunity to carry off the spoil. But it might- also silence him for. ever, and then, thought I to myself, I will have argived at the climax of crime-murder No, no, this wfllnot do for me; I must ' turn-up" this "game," and that pretty soon, too, or I'll find myself hanging out to dry some morning earlier than I'll have any great liking for. Bat how to get out of the job without appearing as a coward seemed rather difficult. I again wished it over and done with, and made up my mind that at al events this should be the last " cracking job"I would engage in. Joe noticed that I wa :in deep thought, and suddenly asked me what I was thfaiing about. I did not wish him to know, and warded of by saying that for one I thought it wouldn't be a bad plan if one of us was stationed near the " drum" to  , pipe off 2 whither they moved the valuables at night, and where they moved them to; and in case they did move them we coald put our " dukes' on them, without -much trouble, after we entered the shops. "  Why,-yes, it would be a good plan, replied Joe. "Bat it wouldn't be 'cokum, for me to go, for the 'bloke, has already ' grannied my mug' when in there about the super,' and it wouldn't do for him to ' pipe h me again. Supposing you or Jack goes about the i time for shutting up, and when all is right come to & this tavern and report. What do you say!"  This suited me, and before JAck could make a reply, I had offered myself and taken the job to " pipe off b the "drum." All we wearied for now was night-night, PI the "  cracksman's" best friend-but it came no sooner g' because of our longing for itL So, to pass the time C' we walked through the town and along the Parade' b the beach and the chain pier. There was a band of music at the latter place, playing walites and other pI dancing tunes to the visitors and residents of Brighton. I  Any one might dance without paying, as the music was furnished by the corporation of tho town, for the th use and benefit of all who chose to attend it. Every w afternoon when this band played, there was certain to to be a great attendance of ladies, who thronged the road eading to, and out at-the end of, the pier. At the times there was scarcely room to move, so. closely to( packed were the crowd. This made it tip top for the no 'dip," and many a  score of beautiful " skins" found a the watery grave close by, after being ", turned out." It niu   f it was a reglar mint to the " ganl" who could " work i a It," and not anything lik the chance he threw away mne on the street or carriage " lay,', for rather than be Des pinched to rights," he of coure would " ding" the 5ot "sin;', and once out of his " duke" here, it would never be again found, for it would sink to a depth suf; nd ficiently great to prevent forever any identification. at  We had not been long at thie end of the pier among Mo the dancers, when we observed a party "upnlling it "e away" in double-quick time. These were no other at than Tim Foley, alias Shah-mo-mah nee, (a half Irish- an man, half Jew fellow, who had been raised in the th neighborhood of Petticoat Lane, and " knew a little,") ce and the well-known Mag Stevens, the " wire," orfgi. to nally from Whitechapel, bat then of Pearl Bow, Boro BRoead, London. Her " bloke," Tommy Stevens, was just then " serv- t ing a drag" in Dover prison, along with Deaf 'an, the "wire," for an attempt to "1 dip a moll" coming out of the railway station. Tim was a very good judge of g the value of a "super" det it be red or white) " spark it prop" or " fawney ;" and when articles of this kind "11 ' came off," Tim, if he was 1"Sugared," would stand for them himself, and afterwards ", fence" them in the Lane, or hitf 'e va a skinner he would take the things ' on commission and soon find a purchaser. Tim had taken lodgings at Tommy's a short time before Tommy got "sneaked," and of course found time to sympthie with Mag on her bereavement; but nothingmore-Oh, no--nntil one fine morning the sun shone in, and to their mutual astonishment they had made a rotitre and accidently occupied' the one bed that nigh. Well it couldn'the helped now, and nobody else was the wiser, just then; but, however, Mag didn't go out to "graft" that day, nor the next, nor the next; and somehow Tim's -'togs" looked as fresh as If they hadn't been in " lumber," and a fancy " prop"' that had once been Tommy's, stuck boldly forward in the scarf of Mr. Timothy Foley. Alas I for human nature. Mag, thy name was frailty. There is a stair-case at the end of the pier, leading by several stories or landings to the small ships gad pleasure-boats fastened there; and down there we had gone for a  few minutes, and were standing looking cn at the boys fishing, when a voice, which I knew to be Tim Foley's, said in an expostalating manner: "Periah me blind, Mag, there wasn't a  bit of paper in 'ere a one you slung me. If there was I wish I  may be ' lagged,' and ' block-housed' at that." "Well, I  aint going to 'work' another stroke with this ' stuff about ua. Some of it is marked, and if we were ' pinched' we'd get 'booted' very quick," re. turned Mag. After discovering owraelves to Tim and Mag, we left the pair and strolled again towards the Parade, and took another "granny" at the "drum," we then noticed the street door leading from the pavement to the rvo,ems over the shop, and at once took in Joe's i an ot operations for the night'n " graft.,   ' 4 CHAPTER XIIL, IVm S!EPARATE "SWELL MOBS" EET AT BRIGHTON- CHARLEY THE "PLAT"IN "SNAGG^' MOB1'-HOW HE BANKRUPTED HS UNCLE BY 4 COLLARING HS SUGAR" -BE GOES INTO PARTNERSHP WITH A CLERK AND irEEDS THE TILL1-BECOME3 ENAMOURED WITH A M MOLL"AND "PALS" rN WITH HER-HE IS INITIA- TED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF "CLYFAKING"AT THE BRIDGE HOUSE-JOINS THE SCOTCH BOY'S "MOB"AND MAKES PLENTY OF "OAP"'-HOW HE BECAME A MEMBE OF SNAGG'S 'MOB." Time seemed to hang very heavily on us, and night appeared long in coming; so to lessen our anxiety on that point, it was proposed that we should drop in once more at the Artichoke, and while away the time at a game of cards. We knew this was not the best of" cocum," but we had no where else to go to, unless it was into a " square drum," and of course there we would be taken notice of, as strangers usually are; and in the event of a" stink," a description would be given of us strangers, aid finally a " pinch ;" so we chose the Artichoke, and off we went to it. From the number of " guns" at that time in Brighton, one would have supposed that there was not another place in England where a " bag" could be " pulled" away, and yet each " mob" was ignorant of the other's lo. aclity previous to his arrival inthe place. No less than five "mobs" at one time in Brighton I and no races, or other great affair on, at the- time. Here we were, from fifteen to twenty professional pickpockets, all certain atf" pulling" awayfrom ten to twelve-or it might be more-" skins' a piece; and that in such a small place as Brighton I Of course it couln't stand it long, and every gun there knew that, and so it fol- lowed that " theearly-bird got the early worm," and each bird in the whole number was after the worm at the same time. There was Johnny AMarney's 'mob " from Whitechapel; little Tommy Whitaker's c mob,'  usually called "Snagg's mob," consisting of Bill Fran- sham; Harry the Baker; Joe Rowe, the " magsman ;" and Charley, the " fiat"-exclusive of Snaggs, the "wire." The other " mobs" were made up of " moll . tools" from the Seven Dials, all at one time coursing  through Brighton, "pecking" and '" dipping" into al.1 most every "kick" that passed along--the same "kick", not unfrequently undergoing a digitorial inspection'  by the "  wire" -of each a, mob."  As we enatered the parlor of the Artichoke, we were I somewhat astonished atthe number of old well-known d "cross mugs" turned updhns, and, as usual, had to V "collar a  " shant" from each "mob."  This gone through, we seated ourselves and chatted over the J chances of each making anything like a  "stake," - hloe there were so many there on the same " lay,  h although it didn't seem feasible, yet each "mob"' held that their own particular " mob" would make o double their X's at the least, and offered to bet on it. I  Among those most prominent in " cracking" up the I b   sugar" their "wire " would " haul away," was a "stall" belonging to Snaggs' " mob," called Charley - the Flat, whose proper name was Charles Spong; E and as he will appear frequently hereafter in the ' "Leaves," I will at once describe him with as much D of his history as I am at present in possession of. Char. I ley Spong, alias Charley the Flat, was born in Dor- setshire, England. His parents were in pretty good E circumstances, his father being at one time Justice of D the Peace. Charley, while young, was sent to school, A and having mastered all that his teacher could learn him, he-was put to a higher school some distance from home. At this school were a number of young lady t boarders; and as they were inclined to shylark about as much as the boys, soon an intimacy grew up be- tween Charley and a young lady, about fifteen yeara old. This was kept up for over a year until the girl t was called home, and then the evil was found out. i An investigation was had into the affair, and Charley was dishonorably dismissed from  the school. His father, thinking he might do better by sending him to London, under the care of his uncle, who was then car. rying on business, took him up there and placed him in his uncle's store as clerk. For nearly three yeara he kept this situation, but at last his uncle became bankrupt; and no wonder he did, for Charley and an. other clerk in his uncle's employ, whom he took as a "pal" and confidant, managed to help this along by robbing him both of cash and goods, to a very' great amount. This was not suspected at the time, and the uncle's death happening shortly after, Charley and his "  pal" sat up in business on their own hook. The "pal" was one who would have got along if things had been left alone to him; but Charley interfered too much in the business, for when hWs " chum" was absent he always took the opportunity of "r weeding' the till. This went on for some time until Mis partner began to smell a   mice, and then a back out was the consequence; and after the stock was valued, Charley accepted so much for his share, and the con. cern, as far as partnership waa concerned, was tlro f up. He soon went through all that he hadfor his share, and being on his last legs, he had to apply to hi, I father, who, by dint of great Interest, succeeded iu getting him a situation as clerk in the General POst- Qffice, at eighty pounds per year salary. It was during the first three motiths of his holding this situation that he and the " swell mob" became acquainted. There was then living at So. 3 Union street, Boro-road, Lon- don; a  woman named ISelina Glindon, who was the wife of Jemmy Glindon, the " w'rl,", who had left her because of hr great relish for strange ' blokes"Curing Jemmn's absence on the "dip." She kept a second rate "'dossing crib," and One of the "molls" whd lived at her house, "picked up"ChrtIey one night while out on the '  seek," and after "lashing" thgether, she brought him over to Selina's, where he was told to make himself at home, This he did by " turning up" the " moll" that. brought him there, and fixing himself " rybuck" with   Selias, A snarl was the'conequenee trween Selina and her "' dreas lodger," and she was quickly told to "peel" offher " toga" and " namase." Charley, more for " flashnes'" than anything else, at this time car- ried his " skin' n lhiss "tail," and being but three doors from the notorious Bridge Honse, often accompanied Selins to this "lush drum," when going for the "max." Of course he " slung', for what she ordered, and in doing so, 6 flashed" to the "guns" who were sitting there, where he took his " poke " from. This was enough, and before he left the bar, he was "dipped" of h!s' poke," and the " sugar" put around ere he got out of the house. Selina was well aware who it was that " dipped" him, but dared not, even were she willing, to " come it" on the party, and when she was told by him of his loss, feigned ignorance of the cause of it. In a few days afterwards he again made his appearance alone in the Bridge House, and was immediately *' spotted" out as the " flat" who had before " blewed his poke," and "piped off" for an- other "dip." As before, he pulled out his " poke" from his " tail" and again " blewed it." This was too much for him, and being pretty " high," he called the com- pany a d-d set, of thieves and threatened the "cops;" but none there paid any attention to his threats, know. ing they were harmless. From the Bridge House he went into Belina's, and made known his loss. This nettled her some, for he had promised to make her a present that day out of the money he had just lost, and along with him she went to the " lush drum" where she loudly complained of the treatment her friend had received. This "jolly," from her espe- cially, went down rather rough with the " guns" sit- thng there, and she was on the point of being shown out in the usual Bridge House style, when in walked her huband, Jemmy Glindon. He was qauickly " put fly" as to how matters stood, and although not then living with Selina, he walked over to her, and seizing her by the '; top-not," told one of the " guna" to open the door, when out he shoved her, and then turning to Charley, walked up to him, saying: "You must be a 'flat I Don't you know where you are? Don't you know that you are now in the Bridge House, and that you are among the cleverest pickpockets in England --and I myself am one, too. Now, go to ,that nasty sow, and tell her that she brought you here on purpose to rob you, and let her know 'twas I, her husband, that told you so; and with thathe turned to the company, and as he had just been getting the " bag off," called for the " max" for all hands. Charley, or the Flat, as he was now called, left the house and returned to Selina's, to whom he gave his "'super" to "lumber," he having "blewed" every " mag," after which he sat down and wrote a letter to his mother stating that he had lost all his money,. but not saying in what manner he lost it, nor where, and asking for a remittance. While the " sugar" ob- tained on his " super"', lasted, he was right enough at Selina's, and, moreover, she expected a " haul" when   he got rom his mother what he had written for;. but it was a long time in arriving, and during this time he made the Bridge House his regular resort; for, as was afterwards ascertained, he had been dismissed his sit- uation upon receiving his last pay; but whether 'twas for inattention (as he said), or on sucpicion, none then knew. He had been several weeks thus hanging en between- the Bridge House and Selina's, when one morning he was told by his mistress that, as he could not expect to live there' with her all the time without bringing in something, he had better look around and find another lodging. He had parted with everything of value that he had with him upon meeting her, and now was completely "broke." Again he wrote to his mother, and while this letter was waiticg for an answer, he found a home in Ikey Rowe's, who lived close by, and who pitied his misfortunes, and " slung" him a " bob" or a " tanner" to keep him together until his " sugar" should arrive. Daring the time he was waiting an answer to this second latter, he had to per- form the office of general lackey to the "' guns" who lived in Ikey's, and who frequented the Bridge House, cleaning their boots, going their errands, writing their letters and " lumbering their togs" (when out of lack) in order to raise a " bob" to get his "' chuck," and by this means became quite intimate with the " guns."' At last he received a letter froth his mother inclos. ing an order for ten pounds. With this he redeemed his " togs" and got himself to rights again, but having seen how easy the " guns" made their "' tin," he wish- ed to "pal in" with a "mob," and with this idea "stalled" himself into their company. on every oppor- tunity. Before long, and Just as his "sugar" was about out, a vacancy occurred in the Scotch Boy's "mob," they having one of their " stalls pinched" on suspicion, and sent to the Downs (Tothll-fields prison)- for a "drag" (three  months). Being one short, and the races coming on, Charley the Flat was accepted as a ' stall," and next day he was taken out to " back-stall"' the Scotch Boy at the " fly dip." At first starting, of course, he neither knew the "office" nor his proper place, but Ikey Rowe, the veteran " stall," soon put him " fly" to all that was necessary," and that day he " kicked" more than ever he made honestly in the same space of time. -With this " mob" he " worked a long' time, visiting all the fashionable watering places and resorts of public amusement. He had bragged ia the Bridge House that, if he got the chance of going out, before three weeks he would be " propped up," " thimbled up," ," slanged up," " fawnied up,'" "sugared up," better than ere a " gun" that used the House. And sooa he showed he was keeping his word, for all this came true before he had been two months in the " mob." His success in the "gunning" line enabled him to show off among the " molls" aind " cross coved"Sf and around the Bridge House ; but it was in a differ- ent manner to that heretofore when visiting Selina Glindon-then he treated every one, now he treated only himself, and while others of the "mob" were   fqnausderfngtway their "regulhrs," he was saving his, and by thetime he was five months in the " mob," the tabfes were completely turned, and those among them who, had been repeatedly importuned by him for the loan of a , tanner," were often obliged to "Iing" him the whisper for the loan of a " deenir" or two. Upon each occasions he would ask, "Who is the 'AJaf' now?"  He had been with the Scotch Boy all that season, but at last there was a break in the " mob," which was occasioned by the arrest of the " wire," who was charged with an attempt to pick a lady's pecket in the Pantheon Bazaar, Oxford street. The "wire" was sent to the D3wns for three months, and the "stalls" had to live as best they could while their "wire" was doing his " drag." One or two found an opening in other "mobs," but as for Charley the Flat, he was not liked well enough by any " wire" but his own to find a chance of going out. So he hung around the Equestrian, a public house next the Surrey theatre, where the " flash-Jacks" of that side the Thames, frequented. Among them was one, a good-looking girl, named Polly Williams. ShQ was kept by a " swell," and allowed a yearly annuity from another, whom she had gammoned, was father of her child, and who, rather than have this disclosed to his family, settled 75 per year upon her. Charley the Flat (4) saw a- rare nibble in this case, and forthwith "slung his bait." It was "collared" and home he went with her as her regular fancy man. He had kept himself apart from the society of those he had previously associated with, by the desire of Polly, who was afraid he might get " pinched" if he went out again with the " mob ;" and when he at last made his appearance in the Bridge House, on the oc- oassion of the "wire's" release from " sturbin," he was coldly received by his former "spals," and a place in the " mob" refused him, under pretence that there was no room for more than had jast been en- gaged. By this time his real character was perfectly well-known by all the "guns" that used the Surrey side of the Thames. He was accused of being the greediest .and most selfsh "cross-cove" that ever "plled in" to any I'mob," and hints began to arise as to his honesty while previously "I stalling" for the Scotch Boy, some-and Ikey Rowe foremost-aver- ing than many a " poke" which had been entrusted to the " flat" to " turnm-ot," had stood a good " shaking., Of course none could. prove anything of the kind; but he was generally disliked, and old JemmW Nick swore that he never sawa good " stake" "' tarned up" from any "skin" the "fiat" was allowed to handle. For some time it looked as if Charley the .Flat was "turned-up"' by aH the " gunning" fraternity; but at last, through manifold apparent acts of kindness and plentiful " sweetening,"' he managed to " kid"Teddy Grapes to let him have a run or two with him. He had had a  quarrel with his "blowen," and she was just then on the point of " turning him up" when he came in with the news to her that ht tw -ointg   'out again with the "mob." At one time she would have tried to prevent him, but she was getting tired r of him living upon her and using her money as if it ' was his own, so she was glad to let him " slither," and ' out he went " stalling" for Teddy, . His run with Teddy Grapes did not last long, for Teddy was very unfortunate in " copping drags," and Charley was again on the shelf. The next " mob" he edged into was little "Snaggas" with whom he stayed until the " wire" was " copped-to-rights" and " col- lored a stretch., His father, by some means, heard that he was living a rather uncertain life, and wrote to him to come home. This letter, along with the fact that his *" wire" was " pinched" and his " moll" " na- mased" from him, induced him to comply with his father's desire, and down he went to Devonshire, to which place his father had removed the family. His father now got him a place in Exeter, but in this he was again unlucky, having, after repeated watchings, been " bowled-out" ina guilty amonr with his master's son's wife, and of course sacked. This was not suffi. cient satisfaction for the husband of the young wife, and he swore that he would take it in his own way. Charley's father heard of the threats, and as a last re. source summoned all his means together, and by great exertions procured the "fiat" a situation as second clerk in the convict prison on Portland Island, near Weymouth, Dorsetshire I Here was a change I Charley accepted the situation, and quickly entered upon his duties, in the the course of which he often came inclose contact with former associates, who, had he been of a different disposition, would undoubt- edly have kept " kyas.,' But his greed still hung to him, and when some of his old " pals' " offiled" to him for a piece of tobacco, their request would be an- swered by a sneer of contempt. This did not suit the poor fellows who (some of them) were " doing a lagging" upon other people's account as much as their own. So one of those he re- fused the weed to, " split" to the Governor, and Char- ley was dismissed in disgrace. - (Served him right 1) CHAPTER XIV.

You need not sit down beside us, for we'll be there; but make some 'stall' to the 'bloke,' and go right out again. Jack and I will be on the look-out for yon, and will pre- seetly follow you. Do you understand all this, now?' "Oh, of course I do; 'taint the first errand of the kind that I've been on." (I was inwardly hoping it was the last). Having received all the instructions Joe considered i necessary. we  called for the "booze " and drank  success to the undertaking, after which I left on my scouting expedition. I followed Joe's instructions to i the letter, and soon found myself within a few doors i ofthe " drum" to be "cracked." But, how is this I I I asked myself. Why, the shutters are closed I and now I'll have to return as wise as I came. I was about ( to wheel round and  go back to my "pals," when I t heard the click of a lock. I kept my course, and e just as I was passing the door of the jeweller' it opened, and a voice said, "I'm afraid we'll be too  late fr the firstacLt."

"Well, we'll talk about [t when we get to the 'start' and get the 'stuff put abouL' We don't know what might happen yet."  In a  short time Joe was seen approaching, and coms ing up to us, he unfolded a handkerchiet that held a number of house-breaking instruments, one of which he held up to our eye's, Saying:' "There's one of the little darlings what's going to get me a precious fine stakeiS to-night.

Thia satfied him, and replacing the handkeriicef under the breast of his c0st, we all three. proceeded along towards the beach and in the direction of tS " drnuml to be "cracked." During our walk there, I had to repeat what I  had heard'and seen while scouting, and with difiiclty we restrained Joe iBom loudly giving vent to his determination of setting up a " lush drum" and a " dosaing crib" etc., as soon as he reached Leeds. As for-Nied Lengthorn and his three-half-penny affair, called the Boar's Head, he would have to sell out; for every "  gun" in Leeds, including Bquib -Dickson, Joe Bolton, Sheffield Chria, Faker, eto., all would patronize him and "turn up, the other "cross drums." assides, he would take half a dozen of the best look-   ing " dossing molls" down with him from London, and that wAbnld bring quite a Iash to his crib. It was no use trying to stop him altogether, for speak he would, and therefore we at last gave up the effort and let him " slide.', At length we reached the beach, and sitting down together, we concocted the pregramme of the night's" work'" from that time until we should reach the ," start I  "In the first place," said Joe, (who always liked to be the director in 4verything appertaining to any- ' crack' job on hand,) " a soon as I get inside the street door, you and Jack must walk backwards and forwards, passing each other, and if you ' tumble' to anything wrong, give me the ' office' as you pass the 'jigger;' but don't you let a single follow open the door on me, else I'm-a 'dead lag.' If any one should come to the door to get in, walk up to him immediately atd try to' kid' him away, by some tale or other, and' sling' me the office that it is ' wrong., If he or she-or whatever else it may be--don't come away from the door with 'kidding, then haul the rascal away by force so as to allow me to get out and away. Do you ' tumble,' eh "' "All right, Joe," we replied, and he continued: ' When 1 am ready for Jack to come in, I will shove this piece of sea-weed under the door; then see that all is clear, and no one near before you venture to come in. 'You are still to keep walking backwards and forwards, and when we get the place open you may come in, if you .like, and fill your 'kieks' with 'supers' and ' fawneys;' but 'twill have'to be very quickly done, mind you, else we'll get a cheap pas- sage to somewhere beyond Land's-End.

We make up our minds, I before going to it, not to be taken ff tlere is an ypossti bility of gatting out of it. Do you ' collar' my mean- ing?"--and he "flashed" a "noddy" about sixteen inches long, the handle of which he had hid up his coat sleeve. My blood chilled at the thought of what might happen, and I was upon the point of feigning sudden illness, or some other " stall,t" when he arose from the seat and threw a quick look up and down the Parade, saying : "Now, lads, I'm o,; and let's stick together this time 4 and we'll get more'n a horse can carry. - I'll go first and see that you both keep a good look out, do ye hewl '                    I We separated a short distlnce, Joe going first, after a turn or two past the ." drum," to see that no one was " on." Joeslipped ilckly uptothe street door, and from there to the shop door. In a twinkling he was back to the door leading from the street to the *upperpsrt of the buiidilg, and in a few seconds he hid "screwed" the ' jigger and ldisappeared beta our wiew.            - .;. During the summer and autuma evenings a  great number of visitors and town's people promenade along the Parade at Brighton; but this- evening it had be- gun blowing a heavy raw-wind from the sea, and in   consequence only a very few were out .walking. Soon they began to disappear, and before half an hour after we had taken our stations ourselves, here and there an odd one were all that moved along the Parade. Joe had been in nearly halt an hour, as near as we could judge, and yet no "office ;" but soon I saw Jack sfoop, and pulling out the piece of sea-weed that Joe placed below the door, whispered to me as I came close to him; "Nor, keep a good look out; I'm going in along with Joe/' and " offloing" to Joe, the door was open- ed and in he slid. I wTa now left to walk my lonely round; not know- ing what moment some one-or it might be two-would come to the door, and then, as Joe'Said, they were to be "kidded" away from the door and the " offites "slung." But, supposing they would not stand the "kid," what then  "Why, then haul them away by mainforce 1"Oh, yes, Ithought, what a thundering lot of main force I'm going to use against two, aid I single-handedI No, no; I'll give you two desperate fellows inside the " office" and try all I know in the "kidding' line, and if that don't succeed, why then let ye use the main force who advocate its use so strongly. I'll be in no such murderous affair. In a very short time after Jack went in, the door was again opened, and Joe said to me, in a whisper, as I slowly passed: "Come in, if all is ' square' outside, for we want to start a piece of iron work that is in the way, and Jack and I can't manage it ourselves." I would much rather have declined the invitation and kept the position of " outsider."', I wasabout to say as much, but Joe, noticing my hesitations grabbed I meaby the collar and dragged me Inside, saying: "Why, blarst my eyes I one would think that you wanted to " put-a-fellow away," standing out there and me with the "jigger" open for you. What's the matter with you?" "Nothing, Joe, nothing-only I didn't understand what you said at the moment." He had shut the door, and by the light of a small wax taper Jack held, shaded by his hand, I noticed that Joe had beeh making use of his time trying to obtain an entrance. He had cut through the panelling of the stair entry which separated the shop from the main (or stleet) entrance to the interior of 'the build- ing, and had tried all he could to force his way through. But here ho met with a new diffioulty, in the shape of a aheet-iron lining to the shop. This he hadn't cal- culated upon, for on the inside it was painted to re- semble the other wood-work of the shop, and nothav- tig the required tools for removing such an obstacle alongi wi th , himhe was obliged to call me in to help. We three,by direction of Joe, sat down, and placing our backs firmly ilganst the wall andour tfeet on the iron partition or lining, exerted all our strength in on- deavoring to start the iron. For a time It seemed as if all our plans were about to be frustrated by this cursed sheet of iron; and Joe was giving vent to very   tall vernacular, while the sweat poured down his faoe, when a sound, as of some one near by, attracted our attention, and halted us in out " graft r' We listened again; itwasoloser, Histl Joe dlutchedhis "neddy" andwhhispered, "Douee the ti'mmer, Jaok P"Closer the sound came, and just at the moment I was about to lay:my my dake" on the handle of the door and ran for it, a  low " murr" and a tiny " mew" satisfied Us ,that the case of our fright was harmless.

Of course Jack didn't take all thisqunietly. He had grabbed Joe, and there they fought and tusseled, knocking and tnmbling over the :oer basbets and candlesticks that Jack had piled on te eounter.

This brought them to their sens6s, and making a daah at the cases, each one strove to grab as much apspoosible on his own hook. 41 Hist I what is that," said I, " there is a noise% outside--' cheese it.

It was good for us all that I happened to sit between them at this moment, else a scene similar to that pin the jeweller's would have been the result of Joe's re. mark to this..

' From there we could   easily dive into Bill Dnns's, and get rid of whatever each had grabbed from the show-case at the jewellers This was agreed to, and upon the stoppage of the car. riages In the Terminus, and while the crowd were n"lring towards the luggage 4ar, I slid myself into a cab and ordered cabby to drive to the upper end of the London road-not caring to say the Alfred's Head, as cabby knew as well as myself that it was a night-house, and was none of the most respectable. In less than ten minutes I was set down at the place desired, and a moment after, and while I was pay. ing the fare, another drove up immediately behind, and out came Joe, who had told his cabby to follow the one I was inside of, We waited a few minutes, and not seeing Jack ,ar. rive, began to wonder; but this would not suit, for  were just then standing la one of the hottest places In London, and liable to be " tuaed oier" by the first "cop" that came along.

AU were permitted to dance, andafter each dance a drink of wine, told or hot, was expected to be'called for.' This compelled the " flat'" to spend two -shUltngs'each danbe,.one for himself and'one for his lady (?), and as thbose d'anceswee only' as long as the piece of 'muio played, it can easily be imagined what'site'of "pile"of " sugar'+ was taken in a night over the bar; besides, some "fiats" would get so tickled with the wine and women, that they would order from half a dozen to a dozen 'of bottles :,. the oompahy. Here we enjoyed oureelves until-we thought it time to, call upon old Bill. We hadi had pjlenty. of dance, plenty of wine, and plenty ofocial evli.

As we were ab6outto pass the door, it opened, and the ugly pig faceB dP Jule 'Tanner and Mother Farley poked out and saluted as with a " lushy :" "Where the d-1 are you fellows offto this morning? H614on,; come in and take a  ' shant.' Patsey and Bill are inside, and a lot more." We had had a  lot of drink already taken, and we were-in want of some  rest, for we had travelled all i;ght; besides, our job with Bill Dunn had to be seen after, and we were on the point of refusing the invita- tion when Butty, the " chat-pitcher, " ran out, and seizing Getsall and myself by the arm, whispered,    "Come in; fellows; the 'bag is off' with a big E 'stake,' and we're all ' lushing' like blazes on Port, I Madeira, and every other max' in the drum.' Come ? n in." We cared nothing about the different " max"Butty so rapturously praised, but when we heard of the r "bag" coming off with a big 1 stake," we wished to D know who it was-who had "' brought it off." A look t of acquiescence from Getsall, and in the three of us went. Although it was early in the morning, there was quite a " push" inside made up mostly of those who had left the Globe, and who yet lingered for an- other "W Het." The arrival of a fresh face was the sig- nal for another " shant," and forward we marched to the bar and called for a large measure of gin, this be. ing the favorite "lush" of the "picking-up" clan, some of whom could drink as much of it as would wash an omnibusl While looking on at the fun, we heard close behind us the voice of Butty in expostulation with his " moll,; a little diminutive morsel, with wa- tery eyes and-frowsy. hair. "Blarst your eyes, do you want me to look mean before all the folks around here, eh!. 'Sling, me a Ibob' or two, and I'll call for some 'lush,' like the rest; after that we'll ' namase' to ' doss,' d'ye heart and then you can go and get your ' togs' out of ' lam ier,' and we'll go to the' gaff' to-night, eh?" T This "sweetening" succeeded, and she "slung'-him i half a bull." With this he made up to the counter, but before he called for anything, we asked: "Why, Butty, what about the big ' stike' you 'ald wa, ' off?' who got it, 6an you tell?" [ "Why, yes," replied Batty; "My 'moll,' for one, ' got it off'P last night, and was looking for me to ' Cling' the 'sugar' to me, when she happened to speak to H arvey Futtvil in the Globe, and Harvey's old ' flame,' Corky Bet, ' piped' her and started the ' mill,' byt she got more by a great sight than she bargained for, I tell you; that little thing there, Annie Heeley, is no nmug' at the ' scrap.'

Come, drink; what will-you have" ' We looked in the direction Butty pointed, and there, b;ehind a barrel, fast asleep, sat oar late " pal," Little Jack. He had:been " boozing" out very freely, and, nading himself a gonner, very wisely placed his " su- gar" ia care of the landlord. We made up onr minds to let him alone, and by the time hbid have hiX "snooze" out, he would know how to act. "Well, Tom GetsaU, how do you get along?, where do you keep yourself all the time? You never call over to see your old ' chums' now?-heard you were \,   golhgto keep a hotel some where in Regent street. You've been getting so much ' sugar' lately, eh?"

I thanked Joe for his offer, but declined going so far  for that kind of commodity. However, as he seemed ] to be so ' sweet" on the little " moll" from the Dials, t I promised to do all I could in sticking them together. I For that purpose I called her aside and aiked her t where her "bloke' then was, and if she would be at c Tom inivan's rale. She said she was sure to be I there, f she didn't get " pinched" before it came off; i and a  for her "' bloke,'" he had " copped" a " sixer," v but she was going to " turn him up" any way, for he I  wre a ran /, shiser" at everything.

We had at first Intended to let that day slide with. out going into the , booae," as we had our business with old Bill to look after; but this " moll" concern knocked our intentions completely over, and when ventured to hint to Joe our engagement with the "fence," he turned ome, in a surprised manner, say- ing: "To blazes wi' t owd' fence I' Let 'm wait a bit till we're ready to come ; halit he got all the ' stuff  He woin't be rabbed such a bloody lot, if we never went after it, dost think t" I saw how things were, driving, and thought it best to let him slide, especially as I meant keeping him in sight. We had been about three hours in the Clarence, and during this time a continral round of "booze" had been kept up by those assembled in front of the bar. But now it began to deoline, and by degrees the crowd grew less and less, until soon none but Joe, the "moll" and myself were standing there. Some had staggered home; others had taken cabs from the neighboring cab-rank and were driven home, while here and there among the barrels and forms an odd one could be see'" snoozing, off' his or her " buaket of max." Our I'pal"Jack was one of them. Binoe the time when I first introduced Joe and her, I had had very little of their company, for they kept up the talk so between themselves, that I saw little or no. opportunity of shoving my spoon in. So when I thought I  had stood this long enough, I stalled my mug" in among the next" mob" at our side. Some of them were of those who had been turned out from the Globe "lush drum  early in the morning, and were now about used up. This particularsquad consisted . "Iushy"Joe Mannell, stuttering Tommy Dixon (the "sorewsman") Brockey Alee, Chat-pitching Butty, and the renowned (I) but now " shise"Jemmy Tay. lor-the latter of whom had jait struck up, (as he had no other; a stave from his favorite chaunt. "Here, here, Jemmy, I won't have any singing here in front of the bar, and I have told you that re- peatedly. So stop it at once."  " Well, well, Mr. Ferguson, it's all right; we'U   cheese it,' if you wish it. Buf, in the firnt 1act', all up that mea:ure, for we mean to "Have another cruiakeen lawn, lawn, laws- We whil bave a--*' "Stop shbouting, c( singing, or whatever you call it, I tell you, or I'l, not draw yon another drop"-and Jemmy, who had forgotten the previous ".crab on his chaunt," immediately pitched into the few words he knew of the other, and again "squared" himself, ex- claiming: "' Well, ' sliog' us some of that blarsted stuff behind, and stop our mouths, else* how can th' expect (Jemgiy was from Manchester) un to stick here like a parcel o'. mummies doin' nought. 'SUling' uas the s:uff--and here, ' collar that kelter.'" Everybody laughed at Jemmy, for every one knew his good nature atd harmlessness. He, hadat one time been the smartest "knuack" in Manchester, and many a fine pack gave its last kick in his "duke." But, now he was goiog own hill fast, and the thoughts of what he had once been, with the fact of whht he was at the present time, made him " lush'  heavier thin he otherwise would. It was,only a fqw months before this that he kept. a beer shop, called the Two Brewers, in. the Lbndon-road; but he got jealous'of his " mull," Maryanne, and, neglected the " drum." So it went to pieces, and now he " carried the stick" at night for laryanne, and .at times got a run out in some of the "' mobs" who happened to be short of a hand. Stuttering Tommy Dixon had but recently joined our side of the Thames. He -was a "screws. man" of gteat ability, and seldom if ever undertook a "job" without getting "clean-away."  When he came to our side of the water he had just left a party with whom- he' worked, and who uaed the same " lush- drum" as Micky Mack, and the Doctor in Psddington. Now, he was doing a little along with "'broclrey. mug'd"HarryJoice. Joe Mannell,another "screws. man," had at one time" turned up" his own game, and went out "stalling for the dip/' along with Jem- my Glindon, the 'dwire,"who afterwards, when his "wirte' got " pinched," was transferred to Mat Brit- ton 's "mob."' When this "wire".got a "drag'* to the "old horse" (City BridewelD, Joe edged himself into the Sootch Boy's " mob" (the brothers Gildero-.pof them more anon), and " worked" with them until his "wire" came out from '" turbin," when he again- "pal'd in" and "- grafted" along with that "mob.', Bat owing-.o his, co of a " moll,"' as he used to call her (Sally MannelD, he took to " lushing" so deeply that he 'got " turned up" from his " mob" and jobbed and hung around, living mainly on the betr that was giaen him, and in being slung a "1 tanner,I now and then for thoae who:knew his deplorable fix. As for Brockey Ale, he arrived in London from Manchester, along with or about the same time as Joe Elms-another remarkable beauty who was stand. ing alongside but nst talking with this euad. He had a " moll who went out on the, " pioking-up lay," and- upon this was his sole dependence. She was con. fidered good at her " grafst"  and ditto on "lush."   Thid " boozing" propensity of hers at one time caused a quarrcl between herself andJoe, sanda' scrap" ensued, at thetend& of which the '",moll" came out secoLd best; but in the morning she packed up her , " tog-," aLd while Alec was finishing his " morning" Iat the Bridge House, a cab was brought to the door in 3 Martin street, (next door to Yackee Jack's who was then living with Poll Murphy,) and the gay Lady Brookey " nanasee,", and left her darling Aleo. They I had furnished a room upon first coming there; and i Brookey, by means of the " sugar" he raised on the , sale of the " sticks," kept himself from starving until. he got an " earwig" of her whereabouts, whereupon he made tracks to her, and by great promises and en- treaties, prevailed upon her to receive him again into. favor. It was good for him she did so, as never a "mob" in that part of London would dare take him in ' with them, for his countenance was so markedly ex. i pressive of villainy and theivlsh cunning that it would have sold them. Those were the worthies I was obliged to pass the time with during Joe's " palling; in" with the little " moll-knck;' from the Dials. Now all were gone, and, as it was not likely I would be re- tquired albngside of the pair, I resolved to leave and make for Bill Dunn's, first letting Joe know my inten. tions. Joe was too sweet" on hiallittle "piece" to leave her just then. So telling him Whbre to meetme and at what time, I left and went home to bed. I had need of some rest, for what with " lushing," ^ta hours, and sometimes not going to bed at all, I fet; mnob worse after my return from our Frenoh tour than before I left London. As for old Bill, it would do as well to leave it alone until Joe weint along with me. Looking back upon those days of my life from now, I often think what a hard, unprofitable, and unsatisfac- tory ,ile, the life of a " gun" really is. It is true hal. enjoys himself, in whatever manner he wishes, and he ia seldom, wiLhout the means of commanding all those things whaoh honest people call comforts; that is, if he is what is termed among thieves "up-to-any-thing,", (having arrived at a certain degree of perfection in, his. profession which enables him to do so.)  He goes to theatres, balls, concerts, and every place of amuse- ment where others go. This he considers comfort, but he does not feel it so. He knows that others go  there for pleasure and receive comfort, and supposes, aS a thing of course, that he is doing the same. But he is mistaken. There is .a wide difference between kinds of comfort-one is satisfactory, the other is not; one is real, the other is mere sham. In fact, he has no such thing as cormfort. But it would be usele:s to try to make a professional thief in the heyday of his career believe this. Oh, no-he can't feel it then ; he can't see why he don't receive comfort, the same aa. others, when he pays for it-it would be useleas to argue with him. Now, what is it ihat compels a pro- fessional thief to be al ways on the move, restless, and anxious for change? Hei neversatiffied. If he goes to the -theatre, he wishes-or rather. feels-th't he i wants to go somewhere else; if he goes somerhere.   else, still somewhere else is craved for!--always on Cie owee, inmind or inclination. Change, change!- variety, variety Hs his only real (or as near as can be to real pleasure in this life. It is not fear or cow- ardice that causes this, no, no-for take a " gun," as he is termed in slang phraseology, from the moment he opens his eyes in the morning, knowing that he must steal money that day or be in want, does he feel any fear or terror about him in consequence of this knowledge t Far from- it: I want i, and must get it, that's his doctrine. Talk about fear I There is no such word in his vocabulary. It was getting towards seven o'clock, when I was startled from my sleep by a voice calling me by name. I knew who it was, and answered. Presently Joe en- tered, arm-in-arm, with the " moll-knuck," and coming up close to me, he gave me a navigator's slap with his, open "duke" before I could enosase myself in my trowsers, at the'same time saying: "Si' thee, lad, does than see that little Judy stand. ing thear next t' auir?"I turned my head, and there she stood, laughing all over her face, and affecting more modesty than a troop of Spanish nuns.  Does than see I'm axin' thee t" "Yes," I replied. "Well, then, if than does, thau sees a 'stunner 1'" (I wondered if she was equal to the " stunner" he left in Leeds and had promised to me.) Another slap, and out he comes:           ; "She's a raal ' stunner, none o' thih tuppeny-ha': penny 'molls,' asd she's mine Hwhat's than think t We've been and dun it, lad, and now she's mine, and she sal go wi' Joe down to Yorksheer, and I'll never leave her, and's Idng's I kan hannel a ' tool' she'll never want ought she wants. to got, wilt tv lass r' ", Why, Joee, have you been ' booing' ever since?' I inquired, seeing that he looked and acted differently frem usual. "Nay, lad, I've been to bed sin' I seed thee t' last tyme, and hida gitood n0oose,but wen I got up I felt kynd d' thurity, ad tiout I'd throw in a slackeesr, than sees, 'caus mytyoitth feled so warm and dry." "Well, what do you purpose doing to-night?" I asked. "Wy, than sees, we've got nowt to do as I know on, and ffthau'll come wi' me and t' t moll,' I'll treet thee to t' gaff,' and then we'll see 'bout that thear ' staff' that awd ' fence' has got, to-morrow. Wat dost thau say?" "All right, Joe. But where are you going to sleep tonight? If you have not engaged any place, I will speak to the ladlidy of the 'draum,' and may be she can let you have furnished rooms while you stay in London. Will that do t" "Yes, that the'ir is ust the ticket.?' As soon as I was dressed I went below, leaving Joe and his mo m n my room and stating the case-to the landlady, she returned With me, and showed Joe a room on the same landing with. my own. They agreed aboutthe price, and everything being settled,   we went to the 'gaff," saw the play, and returned home. In the morning Joe and I went out to find Bill. Dunn; but something having "came-off" the night before, he had been taken away on business, About dinner time we met him, and in case we might be seen talking together in the street, Bill " slung the office" to follow him into a " lush-drum." We got quietly seated, and the business commenced, Bill tanding out and playing a "fencing" game in earnest. We saw that he was chiseling us, and that in a tall way, too; but what could we do I We knew of no other "fenoe" -whom we oould trust with the "stuff as we did Bill, and at last we had to take what he offered for them, reserving, however, one dia- mond finger-ring each for ourselves. We got part oi -the money then, and were to get the balance during the evening. After we parted from Bill, I told Joe that I was going to " jug my stuf'f next day when I received from Bill what I had sent to him to keep for me, wheh we were on our tour. ' Well, I wish I had- enough to 'Jug,' ano I'd do t' saam. If I hadn't a bin a bloody fail, I'd a had as much-as thee instead o' playing it away in that awd French Jew's across t' watur; but ei'-the-look heer. My little Judy says she's had a run o' bad lack for sugn tyme, and. she was blyg'd to ' lumber' her best 'toggery.' Now, I'll git 'em eount fdr hur, and let hur sail out on t' 'dip;' an' if we git enuff ' sugar,' if than's a mynd let's go down to Leeds and open a beer shop, or a cigar shop, or summit. , Than knows she cood mynd t' shop and we cood go e-out thru, t' day and ' ipot off' a thing, an' do it wen we'd a myn to, Wat does thau thiak o' that, eh?" I told him, in answer, that I was about giving up all idea of ever taking a hand in a " burst," but that if he pleased, I would join him and his " moll," on the 4( dip lay," and if any thing worth "came off," I wouldn't mind taking a trip along with them down to Leeds. This satisfied him, and home we went, and after din- ner the three of us drove over- to the Dials, in order that the " moll" should collect her pawn-tickets and have her "toggery" redeemed. As she didn't wish any one to '" pipe" her with a strange " bloke," she told us where to meet her in the course of a couple of hours, and off we went. '"Now Joe, as we'll have an howur or two to spare be. fore the ' moll' returns, supposing I show you a fesw of the ' oross-cribs' in this part of the town. Are you willing I?" "Willin' aye, lads, I'm willn' fur awt thau's a mynd to. Aye, than never seed such a nice ' piece' as that thear little 'un is I wI oodn't ' tarn-her-up, now fur all t' ' molls' i' Leeds.

I am ac. quainted with her since she first turned out ' gunning,' and when 'twas known here on the Dials that she could ' pull a bag away, she  had a& host of fellows  after her. Bat she kept pretty clear of them all for some time, until one night there was a raffle for Little   Brammy the ' wire,' and during the night she ' lushed' so much with every one there that she got completely ' boozed,' and a' moll' ana ' bloke' took her away from the raffle, under pretence of taking her home, and when she awoke in the morning she found herself in ' doe' with the 'bloke' and no one else near her. This was how she became acquainted with the ' bloke' who is now , doing' his' sixer,' but she never liked him be. cause of the advantage he took of her." "I wish he war heer, I'd break his nose for it, t' mean scamp. Dost thau think 'ee kan 'e scrapp' a little? Wat loike is 'ee-happen, t' rascal 'll want t collw her away froo me t If he duz, I'll bust hiz gall!" Never tear, Joe, I'll bet he'll not trouble- you any. He never was up to much, and this " sixer" 'll take all the steel out of him and send him to his original oc- cupation ("eoster-mongering.') "If it don't, I'll send him to a wau plaice, i 'ee  cnms near my little Judy. I'll bet a ' toddy cake' on that much," said Joe, who was decidedly over head and ears " sweet" on his little " moll-knuck." "Well, here we are Joe ; don't say anything here about her, for they all know her in here. This is the Prince Albert, let's go in and I'H show you some of the ' cross' folks in this quarter." In we went to the Prinse 'Albert, where, standing around the bar, a number of" guns" " smashers" and "holsters" were busied pouring out the everlasting gin. Some were already "boozed" and others wel on the way to it. Among them was Little BramuiY, who had got " turned up" that morning from Hick's Hall, Clerkenwel, on the charge of easing a lady of her "skin" while looking at the piotures in the Na- tionl Gallery; and through Joy for this event, they were all getting drunk, although, as Brummy con. fessed to me while talking, they were obliged to " lum- ber" some of the things off from the "bed," to raise the "ehink." As oon as we got in, Brummy came to me, and " collaring" my " duke" gave me a hearty drunken shake, saying: "How are you, old ' splojert' What are you going to have? Don't you see I've Just got 'turned up.' Blind me I they can't keep old Brummy, no how-can they, eh?"  "I hope not," I replied. While talking to Brum., I wa surprised by an exclamation from Joe: ^  "Why, thunner me blind I  if thear aint t" cove', wat 'grafted' wi' us abroadl 81 thah I hur cum this road,"'shouted Joe to some one he was beckoning near. 1 "How dost a   do lad, eht My 1 I thout I'd never see 1 thee any moar. Cm and sup; wat w' t"ave?"'-and forward to the bar Joe pulled our late "ohum," the I "wires who "dipped' the old Judy of her "poke" a at the Custom House, Folkstene. He had "torned z up graft" with all of his late "stalls," and was now I "grafting" on his own hook. "Lag'd" or not" lag'd", i as he says, he was bound te see what was in the t "poe," himself in future. We staid in the Prince Al. I bert until we thought it about time to meet the Judy; f and after treating all round again, we promised to be I   I' at the raffle that night, and left. I had intended to Ig have shown Joe other houses of " cross" resort in that n neighborhood; but owing to our detention in the d Prince Albert, there was no time to do sothat day. n So we put It off'until a future occasion. We met the i " moll" in the place agreed upon, the Corner Pin, St. o0 Martin's-lane, and after a few hours rambling, we ,' went home to prepare ourselves for the rafflte. CHAPTER XVII. THE.

Tom Ginivan, the person for whom thiraffle was be- ing got up, was a native of the Seven Dials, London. His father was a lime carrier, and his mother sold water-cresses. Tom was brought up to the "castoring" bfz, when he was bfg enough to wheel a barrow. The first barrow he possessed was stolen from another "cas- tor" in Islington, and repainted in a different color. With this Tom used to attend the markets. Common Garden being his favorite, here he would at times load his barrow, and watching his opportunity, slide with the load, neglecting to scaling't  for the "stuff." This soon became "tumbled to," and a  ," plant, was laid for him. One morning, after he had stocked in a tall supply of turnips, mSlS, carrotsand cabbages, he watched for what he-thought was a good chance and off he bolted. He had hired a boy to draw the bar. row by yoking him in front with a length of clothes: line; but al was spoiled by the muddy state of the ground and the extra heaviness of the load.. In the midst of his struggles to get out of the mud, he got into the mire, and Tom was "dollared" and given in chsge to the " beadle" of the market, and off he was ,taken to Bow street, and examined by the magistrate. It being his first charge, he' got off with a " deuce o' moons" to the "Downs," (Tothillfields prison.) While lying in the reception cells, Tom became -acquainted with two of his own age, who were sent down on sus- picion of the " dip," and they being sentenced for a similar term to his own, they agreed, upon their dis- charge, to" work" together. Upon their liberation the fathers of the youngsters came and took them home, but not before Tom had found out from them where they lived, and soon he and the eldest of the two com- menced partnership in the " stook-buzzing" line, and from that to "' tail-dipping" for a "skin or dummy," until eventually Tommy Ginivan became, with the ex.   eeption of Getsall, the cleverest "ttaildip" in the West-end. Now he was-" pinched" and this raffle was to elp get him a " mouth-piece." About eight o'clock, being dressed, we hired a cab and bade the driver take us to the Windmill street end of Silver street, Golden Square, where we intended to get out and allow the " moll" to enter the Cock alone, it being not half a stone's throw from there, through Pulteney Court, to the "erib." In half an hour's time we were set down at the place desired, and, having aslng the cabby " half-a-lus" for his fare, we entered a " lush drum" to take an eye-opener before going into the raffle. While hear we " grannied" each other's appearance, to make sure that everything was as it ought to be-Joe's little "moll" " coming- the valet,' on us, fixing our neck-ties, collars, &c., and we "'ladies- maiding" her in returnta4or we knew we would have to undergo a strict "' weighing up" as soon as we en- tered the room, it being a universal custom among "guns" and their " molls" to " whip on," at meetings of this kind, every article of value in their possession. I have known some instances where, in the heat of summer, these Jndies would attend-some wrapped up in their furs, and their "dnkes," encased with. warm winter gloves, stuck in their muffa; others, again, could not appear with less than three shawls over their shoulders, and all for " fsshness " each striving to outdo the 'other in show. The "blokes" were almost alike in that respect, not daring to show their "mugs" without a heavy overcoat, "flash" muffler and shawl, if they had one I As for jewelry-get back i-bought, borrowed or stolen, 'twas thar I We looked at the clock, it was only half-past eight-rather early yet for a full house, .and that was one of the main points to be played for by those, who, like Us, I were I' sugared up" and wished to attract notice upon entering. So we drank and called for another " shant'" to pass away the time. We waited -here until it was nearly half-past nine o'clock. This, the lady thought, would be a good time for us:to enter; for about this hour all the " sharks"' whose beat' lay between the Quadrant, Regent street, and New street, Covent Garden, and who lived in the neighborhood of the Dials and were acquainted with Ginivan and his "moll,'!;were likely to have got through with their "-graft'" and to have gone there; for scarcely once in a year will these poor areatures be absent from a rafe, except in cases of sickhess or "hapology."' It was agreed between us that Joe aid I should appear as strangers toward the " moll," it least in the beginning of the evening's spree, andthat Joe should ask her up to dance on the first opportunity, and when the dance was finished to find a seat for her between us two. This would prevent her being obi I ged to speak with many whom  she did not wish to associate with any longer, and take the " derry" off her being in our company; for she did not wish them to know that she had " turned up" her former " bloke" and '  palled in" with Joe. As we entered the Cock we could hear the noise of   feet on the floor of the dancing room. This we knew would be a had time to make our appearance, for we would have to make our way through and among the dancers without making the dbet which we trusted to produce ;: so we called for a " wet" at the bar and waited for the finish of the tune. When it had ended, and time sufficient had been given for the dancers to be seated, we (that is, Joe and I,) opened the door and stepped in, immediately upon which i rattling of the plates drew all eyes'upon us. This was what we de- sired, and up we walked to the farther end of the room where the chairman (old Dafty of the Dials) sat, and deposited our contributions-half a crown each- in one of the plates placed in front of the chairman. As we did so, we took care to " flash" the "spark- fawney"each of us had on our "duke." We then got seated, and having ordered the waiter to bring in the "max," waited for the entry of the little " moll tool." In a few minutes she appeared, and as she walked up to the plates we could hear the remarks ol those sitting near us: "Blind me I the ' bags' came off with the little-'un." "Pipe I ain't she coming ounl ,-'twig' her silksl" "I wonder where she's been grafting?" "Make room and try to get her sit down here." "Pipe her 'fawneysh"  "Why, I thought she had them all in ' lumber 1"'1 Ease up a bit, ease up;, here she comes." But it was of no avail. Ourlit. tle lady sailed proudly away, and " pratted"' herseli beside Clara Begwell (Tommy Ginivan's " moll"), who was there to look after the proceeds of the night's gathering. "Strike me blind if she ain't getting too proud to speak to'anybody now. Wait a bit; see if 1 don't ' coollarO her up to the next dance." But he reck. oned too sure; for upon the next dance being called ' she stoutly refusaed, saying that she was too tired, af- ter the walk she had, to care anything about dancing. So he had to return to his " chums," crestfallen and disappointed, amid their taunts and Jeers. "' Never mind, I'll have her yet before the night's out," said he; "nay, I'll go to --  if thau does," said Joe, in my ear, " else mi naim ain't Joe, awd lad." There was a strong gathering here, even at that early hour, besides those who came in later. There were " mobs" from almost every part of London, for Tom was well known. From our side of the water we had Jem Getsall and his " moll"Fanny; George Ap- pleby, alias "snags"' and his "stalls," Bill Franseh(m, Joe Rowe, Charley Spong, alias Charley the Flat, and Charley Hicks. That. was one "mob."' Then there was the Scotch Boy's "mob," who had arrived in town that afternoons Johnny and Charley Gilderoy, Jemmy Nick, Ikey Rowe, Jemmy Rowsell and Jack Williams, Tom Wade, Harry the Baker, Bill Morris, Harry Joyce and Tommy Whittaker, Jemmy Glindon, Cranky Charlie, Bob the Butcher, Jemmy qnanders, iHarry Futnill and Bill Lawler. Saffron Hill was re. presented by Bill Jenkins the " wire" and his " stalls," Bill Pickett and "Whisker Jack," The Dialonians were Mat Britton (who left the Bridge House, Boro- eoad) the " wire," and his 1 stalls," Opera Jack, Mike   Cleary and Jack Eaton, with his " moll," Cal Moody; also, in the course of the evening, Charley Phillips, Harry Good, Little Brummy and his "moll." There were many more whose names I need not mentioin, besides a host of "shakes" (nymp"h du-pave) that -lived in the neighborhood of the Dials, who willingly attended to contribute their " bob"; towards getting Tommy a "mouthpiece." Other "guns" who could not attend, sent their offerings by those who came. Altogether, between " blokes" and-" molls," it was a big thing. The room was pretty large, but -not large enough for this crowd, the only sitting accommodation being forms running the length of the room, and two tables, one at each end of the room. In one corner was a spirit cask on its end, and parched on top sat Black Charley the Fiddler, from St. Giles, one of the best reel and Jig players in London. Beneath him, and sit- ting at the table,acting as chairman, was the renown- ed Daffy, well known to every ' cross oove" in the "stait." He had drank more gin and picked more - "oakum" than any other " cross bloke" in London. He was seldom seen with a decent article of clothing in his possession above two days at a time, his clothes being most of the time laid by in his bureau (the pawnbroker's.) Through this he was eonipelled many a time to stay at home or hang around the " lush  drums," instead of going' outwlfi the " mob." When; he did go out, the only use- made of him was to set him at a convenient distance f the rear to " pipe of': the I fly copS," evetry no of, whom he knew. He has- been known th drink one gallon and a half of gin daily for- three weeks, and, as he said, get fat on it. He Would, while In his -eedy -state, vblhnteer to ' ptipe! Off for a "mob" for a certain percentage of the "dip" -and a quarter of gin, every half hour. He wore a frock coat thatwas the wonder of every "' gun," In London who knew him'; for the longer he wore t the better it looked. --He had it nine years. At first itwia superfine black Saxony, or like it; next it turned into' an invisible green, and from that to a variable brown, and ended in a farmer's atin. It wa sa id, but not in his heirringi that ' it gained thik chameleon! like faculty by toe close prosimity to the bars, gin.  barrels, &c, of the;" hush druis v:on the- Dials. The' I order sootn as given to taie partnersfor the firstBsBt of the Caledoniai quadrilles.' I immediately 'nudged  Joe that this was his time, and forthwith he cromed the room and solioited 'th faVor of -er hand in tis dahce. She consented; and they took their plates  T-hs gave room for further comment on the partof ithe -" p"p lastcly rfiaeO, and he vowed to be evend- with herer long. Joe had never stood up i:&adancef of this kiand before and of coume appeared rather awk. ward while getting through it: and many- w^re: the jeering remarks passed upon him by the laIte favotrd  party. At last, when it ended, Joe lea:her!to a eeatl on the form, between us two, when I told him aslittle" of what I had headf said by those sitting by. 'He was somewhat nettled at it, add felt like going into the   I'slog,'" but after a moment or two, he asked: !"Can that black fellow play any o' t' toons wit wi' dance tu i' mi plaice, dost t' think?"  "Oh, yes," I answered, " he can play almost\ any thing.,"  "Well, as thau's sittin' neer tu 'im, sling 'im this 'ere ' deener,' and ax 'im iv he'll call on a reel or sm- mit o' that kynd." I did as desired, and told Black Charley to play a certain tune I had seen Joe dance to many a time while in Yorkshire. The reel was called and Joe, with his little molly, 'collared', 'the floor. The dance started, and soon Joe was "at home." Some who stood up in this dance were reckoned stars at it; buot Joe outdone them all, and those who before laughed 'at him, now applauded. While one by one dropped off, he still kept the floor, and when at last he had it all to himself, he put in a variety of his Yorkshire touches which made them wonder, and when he fin- ished it was amidst a perfect and continued shower of -applause I More " booze" and more dance, then more dance and more " booze," succeeded each other until all were in a glorious state of devil-may-care-what-hap- pens. But, in the middle of a country dance, Black Charhe had the misfortune to break the bridge of his fiddle. This put a stopper on the shin-dig While the nigger went out to purchaie another. During his ab- sence, and on purpose to keep the thing a-going, dirty Daffy called to order, and proposed making use of the time until the darkey's return, in singing a stave or two. This was vehemently seconded, and after a rat- tle from the-plate by way of calling attention, Duffy atmruc up with "I Brenou 'n a h Mw.9 "At :itB finish he was loudly encored, but'" he couldn't see it," and rose to make aspeech, first emptying a half-quartern glass of the "raw" into uis maw, then sticking his thumb in the left arm-hole of his vest, stiuck out his right " duke," la a Beeher.

At an early age Clara I went to live ont, being hired into a gentleman's famr f ly. to take care of the children, with whom she at i times went out, when she would call to see hermother,  and it was during one of those visits that Tommy first saw her. He had called for 'his washing, and it not being quite ready. he waited for it. The mother was so busied in attending to her business that she took t no notice of Tommy and Clara fsittig there; but Tommy was making use of his time, and gained Clara's i consent to go with hnim to the theatre, unknown to her i mother. When she got to her master's, she invented I an excuse, saying that her mother was poorly and had sent for her to come home that night. This gained her leave to go home for that night, but instead of that she went to the " gaff" along with Tommy, and upon the elose of thO performaMo  teturnd to her mother's house. Tommy and Clara kept company for some time before she fell; but at last, through keeping, t late hour in his company, she lost her situation, and her motherfinding out the cause of it, forbid Tommy com- ing thereagain. But that didnotdeter either of them from seeing and being In each other's company, until atlat, under promise of marriage, Tommy succeeded In effecting her i  At first starting they took a fur- nished room in Great St. Andrew street, Seven Dials, until a lucky ' touch" "' came off," when they took larger apartments and let out some of them furnished to "hakes" who never brought their " blokes" into the 4olse, that part of the " bin" being fixed in some one of the many ' kipping drums" in Long Acre. Clara was a beautiful, blae-eyed girl, and many of Tom' a1ssociates envied him the sweet creature he poeasaed, and even strove to cepplant him in his ab. sene) btt -no one ever succeeded in this while he had hisbrun. When he " copped a drag" on suspicion, as he often did, she'always had enough in the house to keep her from want; and her mother, who had become friendly to her, was near to look after and advise her. . Living on the Dials, she soon became acquainted with pug-nosed Cal. Moody, one-eyed Jack. Elton's "molL"Oal. could put away a drop of gin with anriy "mll'" in the town, and soon after her acquaintance   with Clara Bagnell ehe had her pretty forward on the I "Iush" tack. When Tommy found out that she took her " max," it " crabbed" him to such a degree that the forbade her keeping company with or talking to Jack Eiton's " moll;" and this again brought on a disturbance with Jack and Tommy, and the conses. quence was that they " split," for Jack was' at this time out along with Tommy, "stalling for the dip." Not long after, Tommy got " pinched" in the city on suspicion, and was sent to the Old Horse (City Bride- welD for a "duce of moons." While he was doing this bit, Cal. again " palled in" with Clara, and took her outhe "lush" worse than before. Oa one of these sprees along with Cal. Moody, she became un- conscious, and when she awoke in the morning she fjund herself lying in one ofthe " goosing cribs" in Long Acre. How she came there she could not tell, neither could she gain any information from the old haeg that kept the "drum." It was evidently a "plant" upon Clara; for afterwards when they were "' crabbed" at each other, Cal. would hint that she knew of something that Tommy would ike to hear, and soon after, while disputing about their t' molls" on the Dials, Jack Eaton asserted that Tom's " moll," Clara Bagnell, mwaa no better than anybody else's "I moll," if he was to believe all he heard about a cer- tain "bloke" and her who were seen entering a 'drum" in Long Acre while Tommy was doing his a' duce of moons."  Although Clara denied all knowledge of anytlhng wrong having occurred, Tommy couldn't be pacified, and in the quarrel Tommy 1" muzzled" her for having anything to do with sly Cal. Moody. This brought on a reparation, which lasted only a short time, Tommy "caving in" first and buying her several costly presents from  his share of a good "stake"' that had been "brought off."   Afterwards she fought shy of Cal. Bloody, and Jack, being "turned up" as a "'stall," betook himself to his o!ld 'graft," "screwing," on  one of which occasions 'he got "pinched to rights," fuallied" and " lagged." Ulti. mately Tom followed suit, and Clara being left alMoe, unfortunately allowed herself to- be dragged into the company of pug-nosed Cal. -who soon succeeded in making her as common as herself. And she, the long. envied, pretty Clara, the belle and pride of the Dials, finished as a ny/Mph du pave!  "Order for a song, gentlemen; order, ladies, give your polite attentlon, please, while our worthy and beautiful sister, Mrs. Ginivan, ' chucks us a stave.' Proceed, please." She did proceed,and when she had concluded, every one in the room cried out, "Bravo! encore I encore I Over arain-once more." "' Ladies and gentlemen, in behalf of my afflicted friend here, I return you sincere thanks for your kind attention to the very appropriate " chant" which so sweetly fell from her lips, and beg you to excuse her from releating it. And, ladies and gentlemen, seeing that there stands that black " bloke"Charlie, longing I   to set his " bosh" a goiag, I propose that we have a genuine country dance." "A dance, a dance," repeated the crowd, and Duffy in Lis loudest tone shouted, "Take your places for a country dance," upon which all in the room  rushed on the floor and danced till they were tired out. I had noticed for some time several of the Dia- lonians in close confab, and evidently it was about Joe or his " moll;" and thinking it might be some design - they had in view of." sharping"Joe of hislittle piece I feigned sickness and told Joe I was going home.

( Joe and I noon arrived at WilliamB's,opposite to A't- ley's, in the Westminster road, and there met our littio "moll" who had but just entered.  Fronm the b1r where we had a 1" shant," we hastened to the concert room down stairs, and for an hour or so erjoyed cr-. selves in listening to the half smutty chants of the "Female Ethiopians." At the finish of ono of tflcir songq, the door opened, and a huge figure of a nrr7 entered btaskwards, holding the door open and wLi '. lig as if for his dog, "Here I Bobby, Bobby, cheap! cheep I  Come, bobby-come, bobbyl"  Iareo t1b. doorkeeper interfered, saying, " please to comrn i, 'r, and allow the door to be shut. We don't a'? ow c;,n in this room." AUl eyes were by this time drawn t,'- wards the door where the altercation was goilurq ., and there, arguing for the admission of his "d du,  stood the bald "Doctor," with a cane in ocn Lnil1 and several bunches of horse tripe in the othcr, 1by way of faedfor his animal. Of course, the fiivor of this article of canine consumption, was not equal to the "balm of a thousand flowers ; yet, mont assuredly it was unapproachably rich of its kind, and had the cflfect of driving the doorkeeper and others from the vicinity of where the Doctor stood, who, regardless of all around, still kept calling for his dorg; but Meeing It vain to stand there any longer he left the door, and without a change of countenance marched through the room seeking a  seat. Wherever he went, handker chiefs were flattering ond in constant use, while tho   ors of laughter fr he pector  ome of whom  knew him) became general throughout the Lrgeroom. r o0mrneshe to the dor and up the stairs to get a L breath of fifesh ar; others sidled away from his neigh- d borhood to the end of the room, but he,seemingly un'-  coecibous of anything amiss, eat looking towards the E stage with his bunches of dog's meat Vpoised before v him as if it was a bogiuet of flowers. At last seeing o tIe performnanc was being interrupted, the doorkeeper a brought down the proprietor, and by much persuasionl i the Doctor was prevailed upon to leave the room but X not before he had, as if by accident, dropped piece- I meal the offenatve horse tripe along the floor, as he passed out. A few days before this the Doctor's " lush-drum" had been " spotted" by the police, and officers in pri- vate clothes were detailed to watch him wherever he went, with orders not to let him out of their sight. This so annoyed the Doctor that he took every occa- sion to make it an unploaeant job to those who had to dog him, and for this purpose he had purchased the tripe stuck in skewers and threw at intervals a bunch to the '" copper" who dogged him. Sometimes there would be an easy going " cop" "planted" on him. To such a one the Doe. behaved differently, taking him alog into "flash drums" in another part of the town and to places of amusement, and paying his expenser throughout the day, but usually driving him home * drunk at night. Several got "bowled-out' at this game by their superior officers; and in consequence rere suspended, and others more stringent put in their tlace. One day Doce. had occaslon to visit the city side of the Thames, and upon leaving his " drum" ob- Eerved a " cop" " planted" on him. It was no use to take a cab or enter an omnibus, the " cop" would do likewise; so he walked towards Waterloo Bridge and Firing a ferryman told him to row him across the river. The " cop" thinking he could keep him in view better by walking, proceeded to cross the bridge oa foot, keeping his eye on the boat in the river be- low I When each party had got opposite to the mid, die arch of the bridge, Doctor stood up in the boat, ad builing the!"copperst" shoted: "Cood-bye, old tick in-the-mud ; call in the morning"-and taking the oars from the waterman, rowed rapidly down Itream, leaving the " cop" scratching his "nut" with vexation on the bridge. As I will have frequent occasion of noticing the eccentricities of this celebrated "gun," I will only sow mention one or two of his earlier exploits among the " guns." In the good old time, when Westminster turned out the cleverest " tail buzzing mob" of the day, and the name of Marty Fi!z, Jem Keefels and Bar- rington were known far and near as belonging to the nR .otdaring and skillful "buzz" menin the country, the Ductor threw up his unprofitable profession and turn- ed out on the " shallow cove lay." At first, his in. come was rather meagre, and in order to increase his profit he invented a new method of drarin g sympathy and " posh" from the public. la the '" paddiag-kenl'   Pye street, Westmfutter, whaer e h  dossed" at the ate cf " thrms" (three penoe) per night, the land. ady kept a large, and varied assortment of " maun. lering-tools," consisting of wooden legs, crutches, radded hump-backed jackets, green eye-blinders, loldiers' war-worn togs, Billy-in. the-bowls, dog wagon with dogs in harness, old greasy and tattere d trowaera oata, &o. Inone of theseragged grments--a pair (!) of trowsers-the Doctor sailed out, withno shoes, ne stockings, a rimless hat perched on his uncombed and motted " nut" and part of a greasy apron tied over hi shoulders, and concealed in his ," ankle" was a lump of soap. When he got to where he fancied his dodge would succeed, he would begin by crying and blubber. ing like a whipped baby, and when he had gathered sufficient of a crowd his soap was put in Irequisition. and a madhouse froth was the result, ending with a most excellent sham representation of an epileptic ft Summer or winter, it made no difference to him Down he would drop like a bag of beans on the pve- ment or in the snow, and into the squirm like a sever ed worm. The people would stop and humanely tn to recover him; some with smelling bottles at Uht nose, and others with handfnli of salt from a neigh boring grocery; while some stalwart wagoner would seize his " dukes" and mallet them almost ianto a mum my, endeavoring to " bring him round." Bat it waen'l time yet; he had not equirmed enough, and not untu he had heard such expressions as follows would he "cheese," knawing his Castile, and allow those around him to put him on his feet: "Poor creature, what a sad pity it is to see him io that conditioal" - "I wonder where he lives!" "'Ti too bad to leave him standing here in this wretched state; if I knew where he ived I would pay for a cab and have him driven home. Where do you live, poor fellow?" Doc. would answer in a half-dying whine, I haint got no 'ome nor no mother; I lo-ges in Westminster, but they turned me out lastnight cos I 'ada't anythitk to pay for my bed, and I haint 'ad anythink to heet for three days, and I 'ad to sell all my good clo's t keep me from starvin'." Here hI "pal," a repectably dresed old MD would turn round to the crowd, hat ia hand, uan throwing a few shillingsinto the " cady," say, " "Lie and gentlemen, let me appeal to you in behalf of this poor and afflicted young man; he is evidently in  starving condition, and a trife from each of us, with out maling us any the poorer, would enrich I;rw.  will contribute half a crown towards this really ch6r iRable purpose, and also pay for a cab to take hiN  his lodging house":--and round went the hat ard i tumbled the "posh," while Doc., in order to de i! the crowd sufficiently long-enough for the * cady" i go round, started a fresh spell of blubbering. As soon as all was collected, the old man would c,* i a cab, and helping-the now stiffened and almost froze * Doctor inside, order him to drive to Westminte where, after putting the " sugar about and refresh   themselves, they got ready for another fit in some other part of the town. The Westminster "guna" hearing of the Doctor's great success in " shamming," engaged him to sham a fit opposite a "jug" they wished to "graft." The thing was done, and the I' bag came off to rights," Doc. coming in for a good slice of the " dip." He had been on this." lay" for some time, when one day, in winter, too, Doc. had taken his usual fall, and a sympathising crowd had collected. He was in the midst of the frothy part of the business, chewing his soap and spluttering the suds about his fat chops, when all at once a bucketfull of freezing cold water descended like an avalanche over his almost bare person, and in an instant, like the shot of a gun, he was up on his feet and tearing pell- mell for Pye street, Westminster, while his bald-headed old "pal" " stalled his mug" for the same place at a less rapid rate. It seemed the mendicity officers had heard of this trick of Doc's, and resolved to have a lark over it the first time they came across the " bloke wot took fits," and coming across him that day they borrowed a bucket from a cabman at a oab-rank close by, and let him have the contents. Not lodng after Doc. " palled in" with one of the West. minster "mobs," and, went out with -them on the "dip." He became very useful to them, for in places where the fit dodge was unknown he would take a fall, and by bringing a crowd around, make it an easy matter for his "mob" to " pull away" a number cf "skins" before he would recover from his " epilectic." At last Doc. got " pinched" and sent to the "Downs" (Tothill-fields prison). He was ordered to pick three pounds of oakum per day, else lose his " chuck;" but he couldn't see it. He never loved hard work, and he didn't mean to do it now; so he resolved to act "cranky," and be put on the back seat among the cripples, idiots and-bummers, who only had to work juast as much as they pleased, es long as they appeared to be doing something. 80 one, day he threw his oakum from him, and starting on his feet-his hands 'in his pants where pockets usually are, and a long woollen cap like a night-cap on his head-he pulled a face and commenced a loud blubbering in the middle of a room containing over three hundred persons. "Silence, there, sir," cried one of the omfficer, , and take your seat, or I'll report you." The only an- swer from Doc. was an increased extension of " gob' and a louder blubber. Of course, in a place like thri, where even turning the head from a certain iposition was punishable by loss of food and solitary tconfle- ment, this course of Doo.'s was against all rule, and came under the head of disorderly conduct. But he cared nothing; out-he bellowed, his month cpen, and the tears coursing each other down his fat cheeks. "Come this way, sir," said another "Ecrew," "ard ahut up that mouth of yours; come this way.)" lCu, he wouldn't move. Still he kept bello7ingg, until no a prisoner out of the three hundred in the room bu, had committed himself by laughing rntil he was sore At last tie deputy came in, and seeing th3e lace i:   disorder, asked the meaning of it. He was told, and in a loud voice said:  "What's the matter with yon, sir t-what do you want, eh?"Doc. thought it was no use holding out any longer, so he replied: "H-I wa-want my hobnail I My mother will lick me if I do-don-don't get my hob-hob-hobnail I Oo, Oo, Oo, what'll I do?" "Come out this way, sirrah," said the deputy, but not a move, while the room full of prisoners were con- vulsed with laughter. Seeing they could not get him out from where he stood, two offilers, with the help of a half a dozen prisoners, hauled him over the seats like an overgrown dying calf-all the time ahoutiog his hobnail. He was taken and locked up in a sep- arate cell, and fed sparingly for three d3ay on broad and water, after which he was allowed to return to the oakum room among the other prisoners. After laughing onr fill at the Doctor's tripe adventure, we left Williama's Concert Hall and made for hoie. In the morning after we had breakfasted, Joe inquired 1f I knew of any good tool maker in London, as he wanted to purchase a new set of " cracking" in. atruments, and being acquainted with one of tho best -if notthe best-in the country, I told him there was one not fifteen minutes walk from where we then were. "Well, then, let uz go to 'im, and I'll see wat'a eort uv a fixiu' he'd got the-ir. Happen 'ee woint yke to'fence' me owt o' L' kind, seein' I'm a stranger; if Eo, thau mun 'crack' tu 'im, and tell him it's all ryght, thau know.

" "All right, Joe, I underrtand; but he aint one of those kind of people that want to know all one's business. He is a locksmith by trado, and, besides, is considered one of the best 'screwsmen' in the ' start.'" "That'a wot thau sayd 'bout that the-ir little scamp as wnz wi' uz tlroo t' country, that Jack. And wot's he up tu, eh?

He hadnotseenhim as yet, but it was near his usual time of calling and taking his "morning; ;" so calling for our " lush,' we sat down to wait for hin:. la a iew minutes ievsral of the " mintoniana" began to drop in for their morning's " max;" among them were Mike Gallager, Jem Corderoy and Johnny Harley, the latter of whom had been " gunniog" for more than twenty yearP, and even in that length of tiUe, although Sistttd by tho " .tnurbin" schoolmaatcr, couldn't pell "3 onn BireD. M3 ignorance showed itself very re. markably one morning-, and produced a hcarty laugh at his expense. It happer ed ia the following maMner,   t was3 one of a "mob" belonging to tLe" "rnria,' and having gone to the place of meeting, found aL E'xiest of the "stalls" there waiting for the appear. *cs of the " wire," who was behind time. At that day ere was3 a four-wheelea stage running daily between 4oadon and Croyden, the proprietors of which adver- ,0d the eamo in the morning papers. At the top of the advertisement was a represonrttion of a coach, %dra;n. by four horses, with driver and passe ngers out- idXe. Well, they were getting uneasy about the ab- ierce of the!r " tool" and began drinking, s: oking and ;,.idlLg the morning papers. At length the " wire," ,'^ d 'k1?, came in and at that moment a heavy rain 'i : to fall. This was unfortunate, for they were oit'. u the " fly-dip," and of course the rain would ped  " the people from coming out, and those who wer, :re ady out were sure to be clouted. Whatwas Ut be cone? The " mob" was nearly a "skinner," nd bad scarcely anything to "lumber." Every one vaa swearing and "blarsting his bad luck," when eiVenly a cry from Johnny Harley drew all eyes on 'fo. 5Oh! thunder me blind I Lookee here, get ready; -pipe 1'" and he capered about like a lunatic, holding h.9 newspaper in his hand. ' What's the matter? what's up?" cried the as!on. r-hed " pals." "Why, blarstyour thick heads," says Jack, "don't ;on F te that gift? Come on, boys; there'll be, an ,w9 ful ' pusa.' But here, some of you read it, and tell :  rv here it ij." With that he shoved the paper before re?. f ce of one of them, pointing to the place withhis Cagers. The "pal" read the paper at the place ohtnry pointed at: " that's it, that's it ; read on." "' Well, I can't sec anything in that," said the reader, i3 wonderment at Johnny's excitement. ' Why I Po help me, you must be all blind or ' Iuaehy ,'s morning. Don't you se it's upset, and there'll be the devil to pay amorg the passengers. Why don't jaz come alos?

I took him one side and informed him of our s business there. He said he had just completed a set Dor a certain party, and if Joe had a mind to look at them hc could do so, and if they met with his approval i ,f woulni rig up a Eimilar set for a like price. I called ' Joe to u ; and told him so. Joe agreed to give a fir  l rice f 'I the tools if they suited him, and after another 1 iu ,K"I wo followed Alexander out and into his house, { Oo oby. Being a locksmith he was not afraid tohave ' :   sposc i.1 all parts of his shop screws of every size m ::. I var. Aty, but ina a secret place he kept all kinds of l bur1-,l L' too0Bof the finest quality of stuff, with a pol- t it h  on them like crystal. Some of these he handed to f Pee, who, with the true eye of a" cracksman," exam- i aed rlinu:ely every part, and feeling satisfied with the C :rticlcs, 9?kc d the price. '17as pretty strong, he ir   ,'" though, but theu, the tools were superior to any he "ituAd i;en in Yorkshire, and at last. a bargain was r- struck and a deposit left in Alexander's hands. y  "Aye, lad, them is bonny tools, I tell thee. I never. n seed owt lske 'em sia' I war bomrn," said Joe, when r- we got outside. "'Does thau knoah wat I'm ban to do of wi' em? Well, si' thee, I'll taik and sen 'em off by t' i, Express ryght to Leeds; then, than sees, if t' 'knff t- ters' turn me ower they'll fynd noewt on me. Waint )- that do, 'et think?" d  From the mint we walked to Bill Dnnn's, and there "received the balance of the money owing us, after a which we purchased a quantity of wearing apparel e and went hone. Joe was so " sweet" on his little dl "moll"' that he made her his banker, and when I ask. o ed him if he wasn't afraid that she might "hnamase"' s with the " sugar" and leave him a " skinner," he an. ' swered, "Nay, lad, I'm none afrayd, and if she wur e to do it I'd forgie her, I loike her so well-I do, the a little thing." i  Having nothing to do we sauntered out after Joe gave his "moll" a few  " quids" to spend on herself, , and after a walk around, brought up at Fred Hogg's, of the "Bell," in London-road, Southwark. Here we found " guns" from  each quarter of London, some * "boozing," some smoking, some skittle playing, and others at different games with the " broads." BI. t hind the counter, by way of favor distangue, sat the iblooming faced Lancashire picking-up-mo!l, Dcpper, I alias Fddge'a " moll," and at her side with a " shant , of booze'" in her milk-maid fist, sat Mother Grant, i spouse of the famous Bessieur Capitaine Grant, who, X like ourselves, had made a five minutes tour. of La Belle France, but who had returned possessed of mo-e French than himself or any one else could understand. The trio was made up with the " moll of the drum," safiai (or as she called herselffor shortness) 'Ri Hogg, a short, banty-legged, fat-sided, sloe-eyed, wide awake waddler, who knew how to "  kid" to perfection. It had been her trade before she saw Fred, and while she. was 'nia Richardson; and now it did not depart from her. For immediately she "  twigged" the "spark fawney" on my   "duke," she got ready for action, but it was no use; that cock wouldn't fight. I had stood it once before, but now I was " fit." to the "  kid." We stood a   "shant" for the "molls," and lefi for the skittle-ground below. Here were 1, cracksmen," "  magsmen,' " showful pitchers," "gunsn, and thieves of every denomination. Among the former, with a large skittle-ball in one hand and a broken alderman (short pipe) in the other, was that famous beer eating "cove with the ogles," Geo. Ball, alias Eyes. This was his favorite game, and at the moment of entering he was offering to bet a "sprat" that he could get them in two, or would take three to one he would floor them. He was taken up by a quondam ," pal" c his, Harry Bryan, who, owing to the extremn length' of his propellers, carried the alias of Legs.  Joe wish- ing to have a  hand in, a game -,as got up for. the beer.   Ia tossing for partners, Legs and Eyes -got together while Joe had for his partner a " cracksman" belong ing to Ball's "mob," named Tommy Davls, alias ,ankey, alias Boko, a fellow with a tremendous "smeller," whereby he got his cognomen.

I had left Joe playing with those worthies, and had stepped into the room above, purposing to while away the time at a game of cribbage. I had played over two hours, and not seeing Joe during that time I "cheesed" it, and went below to the skittle-ground to see what had become of him. There he stood, coat and hat off, and the skittle-bal ready in his hand for a throw., At his feet lay a pile of silver, for which he was now playing, and immediately he threw the ball the money was picked up by Eyes and Lpgs, and the pins being again put up, a similar operation succeed- ed. I saw he was in bad hands, but I dared not inter- fere. else " down went my toby ;" so I left the house, and looking for a boy I gave him a few coppers to go in and ask for Joe --. in the skittle-ground, and tell him his wife wanted him. Presently ont he came, and taking him by the arm I "kidded" him along down the road and told him what I suspected. I had noticed Boko, who was Joe's " pal" at the game, "slinging," Legs and Eyes the "office" to lay it on thick in bet- ting on the game, and when that was done Joe backed everything they wished; for they had got him pretty "Iushy" in the two hours he was with them, and the consequence was that in every bet Joe was " thrown over," and the cracksmen, Legs, Nose and Eyes, shar. ed the winnings. This information, instead of deterring Joe from play. iug again with them only served to make him more eager to get the upperhand of them, and back he went to Fred'as, resolving to turn up skittle-playing and try nome other game on his own hook, without the aid of Bo;ko as a partner. I soon after followed Joe into the BEittle-ground, and presently a " school" was formed  at "  mag flying." This suited Joe, and at it he went; he betted so heavy upon heading them that he was on the pointerof breaking up the " school;" but luck took aturM, and before long he wTas borrowing a "quid"    r, or two from me to carry on the game. This he soot, i- lost also, and " blareting his unlucky eyes," home he ,s ran for more "sugar." I had taken a few " shants" a3 while Joe was away, and at his return we again drank to turn luck, and both went in at the " mag-flying.'f Soon I was " skinned" of all I had with me, including the two "quid" Joe had previously borrowed from me, and I in turn had to " namase" home for more " kel- ter." When I returned to Fred's the skittle-ground g was crowded with "guns," in several "mag flyig D schools," each being intent on winning some of the 3 stuff"' they had heard was so plentiful here; so that , they had turned-up their " broads" and took to this. But all could not be winners, and before night three F parts of them had "namased" completely , broke," ) and those who had won the most, slid slyly away, , afraid of another turn of luck happening. i  From the skittle-ground we now went to the card, , room, and presently a fresh " mob" came in, and gam- bling commenced in earnest. Eyes had been doing some tall "garreting" (not garroting) that season, and was pretty flush of " sugar," so that he and his fiery- i headed "moll" date a "slavey" in George Green's l I  "crib," in Webber Row, Waterloo-road) were " blew-  , ing" a few "quid" around, in dress, "booze" and! r pleasure. That evening, after he had " cheesed the rmag flying," he told his Judy to fix up, for he was go- Iing to take her to the " gaff." She rigged up in her ; best, and when all was ready off he hoisted her-not to the theatre, but to Fred Hogg's--merely, as he said,  ) to have a "ehant of booze"' before they went in; but Iit was strongly suspected that he wanted to " flash" her in her new " toggery" before the " guns and pic k-! ing-up-molls" in the "lush drum."He had striven much to civilize her during the time she had been with him, but 'twas " no bottle"-she couldn't 1 collar" the idea. Whatever else she could " collar" was natural to her, but all the " kid" he could use on her was, as he said afterwards, "chucked away for 'shise.' 'Twarn't in the red-headed cow." However, when o the pair came in, a seat behind the bar was offered by the smiling 'Ria Hogg, and the lucky " cracksman'a moll" was invited to take her place among the female aristocracy of the fraternity I But had she been tho "moll" of some unlucky devil who, for want of the "rhing," couldn't let his " moll" turn out in such a rig, 'Ria would sooner see her eye hanging out on her cheek-bone than admit her into that " sanctum sanc- torum." When Bull, alias Eyes, left his " mo;'1 with 'Ria, he came into the room next the bar, an 1 II haz. ard' being the game, at it he went, and in teic course of an hour " skinned" those who played again.., him. This so elated him that he proffered to play afiy three with the odds against him.  Here Curley, onco a "needy mizzler," took the challenge, and tho gamo was again begun. Nothing else being on the board just then, Joe and I slid in, and before long there was a pretty heavy " stake" on the table. This was again won by Eyes, but at length Joe had a turn, and final- ly Ball, aliss Eaes, " blev;ed" thoe la- "mag" he hal   w; him, and out he flew in a passion to the "moll", in I.: ^ bar: "[lva you got any ' sugar' with you?"1 "No," she replied. *ell, start off and bring me some, and that quick- 'I '- 4o, and not be sticking your ' prat' there all day. , ', perish-me-blind I you're half ' lushy' now. Come, ' TnV. Se.'" S. -, "nameoed" and was soon back with a few '  uiidBs," and at it we went, drinking and playing un- 1. I had to " stack" it for want of funds. Presently snother dropped off, then another, and so on till all caved in, and Gaorge Ball,.alias Eyes, was declared the winner of the evening,: fore Wlush" at the bar from the winner, and Joe aid I left Fred's. Joe and I had lost a considerable sum of money dunr rlg our stay in Fred Hogge', and our loss became the nubject of conversation for the evening. Neither of us felt very cheerful over our losses, and to put us in better humor with ourselves, we agreed to go to the play. To the Surrey we went, " moll" and all. The play of I' Jack Sheppard" was on that night, and it being the first time that Joe had seen it, he felt quite in his element; and consequently before the break of the " gaff," had quite forgotten the ill luck at " mag flying." On our return home to the " dossing crib," we sent the " moll" out for some " max," and then sat down to count how much " sugar" we were worth, after which Joe proposed that we should join partner- ship and open a cigar " slum ;" and as a help to get along, his " moll" would go on the " dip" during the day time, while one stayed to mind the " drum," the other acted as a " stall" to the moll while at 1" graft" -Joe and I taking the office alternately. This was agreed to by all, and off we went to the II doss." In the morning, after breakfast, we dressed up in our best, and the three of us sallied out in quest of a "drum," and ore long happened to. alight on a place that seemed to be all we wanted. The proprietor was about giving up business, and for ready cash was willing to let us have immediate entrance. A bargain was concluded, and on the following Monday we were to take possession. In the meantime, Joe and I began purchasing our stock. We bought largely of the Whitechapel cigar- miakers-mostly from " sheeneys"- and not being very excellent judges of the articles, got sucked in alarm- ngly. "Tall" periodicals and pipes, snuff-boxesand smutty cigar-cases, etc., etc., were ordered, and a carpenter was hired to put up the " slum." After all this was paid for, we found ourselves next to " shise" in the " eugar" line. At last we opened shop, andfor the first few days got along swimmingly until the top layers of our best havanas were sold, after which we bad repeated complaints of the bad quality of our ci- gars. It was then we "tumbled," but it was too late to be of any benefit to us. We saw we had been sold by the "crucifiars," and resolved to "sell" them in return. Oar first custcmera in logss than a fortnight "namased," sad left us only the casual passers-by, and they didn't   r call wIce. About two weeks after we opened, Joe one morning proposed to me that we should go and seeo a launch that was to come off at Blkckwall, and having nothing particular to do, I agreed to go. We gave the Judy strict orders to keep her eye peeled, Rs we were going to leave her in sole possession of the "crib " for the day, and jokingly bet her on the amount she would take in during our absence. Oa the way from where we lived to Blackfriars Bridge, we had to pass the Doctors', a--.? yhen opposite his !" lush drum"I mentioned to Joe that it was there the "bloke" lived that dropped his tripe in the concert room. "Oh, let's go in an' see t' fat rascal; I won. ner gin he's i' t' house; come on, we have plenty ov tyme before the boat's shoved off," said Joe. So, to the fence gate we went, but it was closed, it and defied al1 oar efforts to open it. While we were trying to, do so, I saw the Doctor looking from his bar window and grinning in high glee at our fruitless attempt. Not being personally acquainted with this renowned indi. viduil at that time, I was about giving it up, and had moved a step or so from the gate when a tapping at the parlor window drew my attention that way, and there stood our late. " chum," the "wire " that "nailed" the "moll" of her "poke" in Folkstone. He " o"ioed" for us to hold on a little, and in a second he was beside Doc., poking him "fly," we Supposed, as to who we were ; for In an Instant the "jIgger" flew open as if of its own accord, and in we went. It ap. peared that the Doctor and those frequenting his $" drum," were annoyed at the frequent appearance of "fly-cops," who entered unawares and " grannicd't the "mugs" of those they found inside. So to pre. vent this, Doc. sought legal advice, and was told to secure his door in such a manner that they could not steal a march on him but by means of a warrant. So to it he went, and hired a machinist to do the fix- lug for him. This fixing consisted in having a strorg iron rod running from the gate to the inside of his counter, by means of which and the spring-loek on the gate, he, and he only, could from behind the bar open and shut the gate at pleasure, and admit the "rybuck" kind. One night when there was a great gathering of "guns" and their 'molls" inside, it being the night after Epsom Races, the Doctor was so occupied in serving behind the bar, and also in attend. ing to those in the room, that he forgot to secure the gate in the usual way, and when everything seemed at the highest-card-playing, dice-throwing, singing and "boozing"--the inside door opened, and just as the Doctor was drawing a pot of Barclay', in ,walked a brace of policemen in disguise. Doc stayed his "duke" while on the draw, and looking them steadily in the ' mug," asked "Who let you in here?"--at the same time giving the " office" through the open door to those in the room, that "Mr. Ferguson'^" beer was ready for him. This Mr. Ferguson is a name used by first class "guns" to intimate, in the absence of any other "opportunity, that a " copper" is present. Ia a moment after the " ofEce'" was given, the "jigger"   i i. " slewed," and banrloaded by half- adozen of de-.I f.-ramied " guns" who were resolute that no Jack-the- *,rong-man" should enter there that night. So all the "cope"' could do was to " granny" -the " picking up o1Ila" " lushting" behind the counter, and who, seeing iha fix the " copa" were in, "I kidded" "jollied" and j.rs6d them at their own price. Seeing that they could do nothing there just then, the " cops" turned to) " vamoose ;" but before they could clear the door aell, a fall like a young Niagara fell en their unlucky "aunb," and following that up came a -shower of W edgewood's bed crockery, of all sizes and qualitiea, on their devoted heads, while a otwrus of female llaughter gave strong indication who were the delighted authors of this window shower. This hastened the exit of Mr. Peeler, and immediately all was clear. Doc's voice could be heard above all the laughter and din, shouting up to those who threw the utensils from the w indow: "Bey I lookee here, you infernal cows up; ther!- why don't you chuck the beds and bedsteads out too? Blind me I you'd better ' collar the crib' altogether and turn me out t Whose to pay for them 'ore' jerri's, I'd like to know? When you want to go up stairs again for a somethink-you'll have to bring your own pottery along; ' lag' me, if you wont i" The only answer Doe. got to this was another com- bined roar of laughter from the Judies above. "Well," said he, 'IfI can't get it off you 1'll try your ' blokes,'" and with that he '" collared" his " cady" in his 1" duke" and bursted into the room among the " guns," hold- ing his hat out before him: "Se here, boys, I know the ' bag' 'I come of to day wi' the most um ye, and there is a poor fellow wat I know has met wi' an accident; a good many an you know him as well as I do, and he's a ' rybuck' good fellow, bat he don't want me to tell his name. That's no matter; as I said before, he's met wi' an accident, and a few ' bob' 'll jut fix him right. What ever I can get for him, I swe r will be given to him; and to begin the thing, I'll sling' a shilling myself. Bat any one what hain't got a shilling to spare to night can drop in a- ' tanner ;' everything will help, you know. Here goes my ' deenir' "--and with that he 't elung" a shilling into the " cady" and went round the whole crowd collecting, until he had received more than would have paid for half-a-dozen aeta of!" bedstead bloomers," after which he returned to the bar and chuckled over the operation, while he counted the eon- t;ibutiou into the drawer. After a game or two, at cribbage Joe and I left to go see the launch. When we got to the city side of tha Thames we took the omnibus for Blackwall, and were in time to get on board the launch, which was at oe. ready te leave the slip. There was a great many ladies and gentlemen on board, and among the ciowd we saw several ". mobs" at "graft."  Thiakirg tksre might be a chance for burBelves, we g t icady to take. a trick; and upon the word being given for aill those who did not feel inclined to Bt on board, to   I go ashere-the vessel was upon the point of being set free from the ctooks-an immense number hurried to- wards,the only point of egress, a narrow entrance at the ship's side. This was our time, and " blinging" Joe. the ' office" we both mixed in the crowd and com- menced " graft." It was a regular pull-away affair, more like " flimping" than anything else; but once gothold of, it was sure to "come away." We were carried out in the crowd, and upon getting ashore made our way to a "boozing crib" outside the yard, and there " turned out" three " skins" and one band- some double case " ridge super." The empty "skins" we " slung" in tho " dunniken," and hiring a cab, told cabby to let us down at the Elephant and Castle, soon after which we met Bill Dunn and "fenced " the "super." Altogether this day's "graft" brought us in about twenty seven " quid," and we needed it, too, for on our return home to the cigar " drum" we were met upon entering by Joe's" moll," with a smile on her " mug," and before we were well seated she told us she had done more in the cigar selling line than either of us had done as yet. In fact she was com. pletely out ef silver, she had had suoh a run. All was gone in making change to the customers. "Well, lass, how much hast thau taken sin' we ben away?' askedJoe. She ran to the till and brought three sovereigns and a few shillings worth of Ooppere.' "Did than give change for these," asked Joe of herin amazement. "Why, yes," replied she. "Well, thau's a foyne tobacco seller, thau is. Si than," said he to me, handing me the "quid," "I'm blareted if she haint gone an given our good ' sugar' away for this ' showful stufl' an' tobacco an' all." "Hojid thau do it?" said he to her. Why, I didn't know it was bad; a man came in and bought a half-crown cigar case and illed it with cigars, and then he gave me the sovereign. I could'nt tell it was bad; he was a respectable looking man. ; After that another bought a pound of the best smoking tobacco, and gave me the sovereign; a good while ; after, a lady came in and bought a meerschaum. She said it was for her son who was going to India, and I gave them all change." , "Well, thau'll change no more such muck as this i' thias ' crib,' any how. Why, if we'd let thee alone for l another day, thau'd a had t' ' crib' cram full o' show- I ful; get on thau ' togs' and,' namase' as quick as thau can and 'smash' these 'ere 'quids' somewhere or another; I don't care where-on'y ' smash' em." I was somewhat surprised, not only atthe " copping" F of the " showful" but likewise at Joe's harshbess of 3 manner towards the Judy; and knowing that it I couldn't be helped just then, I ventured to put my t  " epoon" in, saying X "A Well, Joe, what has happened can't be altered now; she didn't know or even suspect the ' quid' was ' I wrolg,' else we are both well aware ohe wouldn't i have ' smashFd' them, SBe done the best she could, a oonuideriig cver-thing, and 1 thiik it is the best way,   if you're agreeable, to let it elide; for yon see, Joe, ' smashers' have to live by their ' game' as well as our- selves, and taking all things into consideration, after, the lack we had to day, I say, don't send her out to chance7 a 'pinching,' for the sake of the paltry three ' quid" "Well, Just's than sa's. I thout than might'nt like to ' blow' so much on her account; but as thau's will lin; all's ' righteous'--and here, my lass, bring us some beer," said he, handing her the jug and "Euger." The beer was brought and supper was quickly over, after which Joe and I sat down to enjoy a cigar each. While we sat smoking our cheroots a couple of men entered, and the Judy left the parlor to serve them. As she passed Joe, he whispered: "Now, lass, look eont for t' ' quid blokes ;' than's taien a plenty on 'em far one day, so keep than eyeP peeled." The " blokes" got served, but instead of leaving the shop down they sat on a bench in front of the counter, and began questioning the " moll." From where Joe end I sat we could hear everything that was said- "How long were we in this line of business?--what was the name of her husband?-where did he live be- fore he opened this shop," &c. "Well, wat a sight o' impidence them two fellows have!" whipered Joe to me; "I'll bet my life they're two skuffcers., Wat do they want here, I'd lyke to knoah I'll soan ' crab' the-ir pitch, anyhow," and oat Joe walked to the counter. "Good evening, sir," said both to Joe. "Good evening, gentlemen," he replied; "'ave yees cum a far ways to-day?" "Oh, no," they answered, " we live close by; what made you think we were travellers?" "I thought you milt be travellers, 'cause I heerd yees axing my misses all about us, and that's jus the I saim thing as we du wer I cum froo, wen we sees i foaks we doant knoah anythin' about." "From 'bar conversation I would take you to be ( either a Yorkshire man or a Lancashire man," said  one; " aint I right?"            t "Noa," answered Joe, " than aint ryght, an' I doant E think thanu can gess mi naytiv plaice in a week.'" "Well sir, where might it be, if I may presume to a ask?"  "Well, I'll tell thee, but I doant think thau's ever e ben thear, an' so thau woant knoah much about t' ' plaice, but happin thau's heer'd on it many tymeo"- e and Joe leaned his elbows on the counter looking 1 them steadily in the face. "Well, then I war born'd b in a puttie little plaice called Suckemin, just about a g myle an' a 'afffroo Gammontown, wer I wus bro't up M to t' trade o 'tat-faking,' that is, maiking awd rage lI bring thear money's worth; no matter wethurs they's li white tats, woolen tats, or harding's, 'twas all t' eaim ft t' mi i' mi plaice; but Is I was sayin', Suckemin lies en 'bout a myle an' a 'aff froo Gammontown i, t' parish ti o' Greeny-Muggleton-shire."          S "Is that any cwhere in E gland?" asked one.    }  " 1a England I Non, I'Pe think 'twarnt i' England, r- it lies a good many myles tother syde on it.

"Doant be in a hurry, gentlemen; e I haint got 'aff throo yet; or if yees can't wait, call in I igiin wen yees cum in, an I'll 'ave a map o' t' plaice e wer wi all cum froo, ready for yees t' look at. Good nyght, gentlemen, good nyght." r, Oat they slunk, each trying to be in advance of the r other, for they felt keenly that they were sold, and as e they passed the windows I could see a peculiar smile e on each of their faces, plainly telling that the story about Suckemin tickled their glzzards a little mora e than they were willing to show.

I slept but very little that night, as something struck me that all was not goingon as it should. The visit of the two " peelers" to the shop wa-tiot merely for the purpose of buying a cigar or two-there was something else behind-and I was right in my seupi- cion; for every day after their visit we noticad a "kuffter planted" opposite the " drum," and a front room which for some weeks before had a ticket on the window of "A Front Room to Let," was occupied by our watchers. What did it mean? was the Br4ghton job about to be brought home to us? Perhaps some one had " nosed" on us. If so, who could it be? None knew of it excepting Jack, Joe and myself-not even Bill Dunn, although he had "stood" for t' e "stuff," and knew for certain where it came from. Or cou'd it bo that we were "'marked" home from the ship launch? That wasn't likely, for if any one had been "  on," we would have been "pinched" before getting home, and " frisked." However, it was plain we were "put away" somehow. Not one of us daru leave the " crib" to do any "graft" in the " dipping!' line, else in a momdnt one of the " copas" was out and following. We had one advantage over them, hows ever, for we knew they wereo ' on," and they all the time supposed us iguoiant of their proceedings. Something hal to be dane; oa after ehauting up ons 1eC concern one mnght, rse cn t for Bonm: e- . asad   then laid our heads together what was beat to be done. In the first place it was evident we all could not live on what was brought in by the sale of cigars and tobacco. Our stuff was 80so " shise no one ever came back except to tellus our goods were worthless. We were well aware of that; we had been" crucified" by t0e "sheeney" cigar sellers, and it could not be al. tered now. In the second place, we dae not attempt the " dip"' while things stood as they did. "Let nz ' turn up' t' blarsted consarn, any way." said Joe; "we haint makkin' a blarsted ' ateever" wi' t' crib? Wat way's this to live, I'd lIke to knoah, wi, a 'copper' runnin' at a feller's 'pratt' all t' time he's out? I'd ju' as leif be i' ' sturbin' as be i' this fix; let's 'fence' all t' blaraed mynnagerie an' namase' to sum other plaice. Wat's thau say? wilt do it?:' I thought Joe's was a good plan; Bso in the morning we went to  an auctioneer's and made arrangements . with him for the sale of the stock and fixtures. In a few days, all was sold. The next thing was how to get away without being " dogged" by the " cops."  At last a way showed itself, and everything being ready off we went arm in arm to Astley's amphitheatre. In Astley's, any one who feels dissathfied with the ac- comodations of the pit or gallery, can by paying the difference of price, get passed to another part of the  house. This is done by means of a private stairoase,  not interfering with the main entr:s e. As we walked I along we could see a couple of " cops", following us I on the opposite side of the street to where we were. a We could afford to grin now, and grin'we did; for we e knew that ere many minutesthey'd be thrown off the a acent. At last we reached Astley's, and going up to g the check office of the gallery entrance, paid for three. r Ihad g ven Joe the cue before entering; so, as soon f as we reached the ticket-taker, I purposely kept him c in conversatich (the crowd having entered a good n while before,) and when Joe had had sufficient time d in which to operate, in I walked. I looked all around p to make certain, tut no Joe the "acracksman" and hiA " little" moll tool" could I see. Itwas , rybuck"-the fl charm had worked, and an instant after I had paid the w extra money, and I flying down stairs by the pri. p rate way to the pit. A moment more, and out I was ri by the front entrance, while the " cops" were dangling \ at the gallery entrance round the street corner. Close w by the bridge:I waited for an omnibus, and after a ai 'ride of about fifteen or twenty minutes I was put down w a', the corner of Baker street, Poriman square. Here at 1 was met by Joe and his Judy, who enjoyed a hearty of laugh at the outwitting of the two "fly peelers." We ie weat into a oorner " lush drum," the one where I had sa told Joe to meet me after our get-away, and there we sa drank to the health of those we left behind, "piping cff" ci atthe " gaff." This night'e programme was all made up ly before we left home; so each of us knew our places and LB what was to be done. After our "shant" off we started, (p 8am-in arm, for Madame Tasaaud's great was woritk  exhibition in Baker street, I had often 'worked" this I    place, and was posted on it, but it was the first ve time for Joe and his " moll" to be there. There was' Id an immense crowd of people there that night; so great e was the throng that, it was a hard matter to crush e through and between them. This was what we liked, y and ere many minutes the " moll" and I were hard at I. "graft-"Joe doing the "piping," for we didn't re. quire "stalling," the "push" was so dense. Every few minutes Joe would receive the ' office"' from my. "self or the " moll," and the "skins" were " elugug" to i' him. S3 quick were we "nailing" them  that Joe i, hadn't time to turn them out in his "kick," as pre- e viously arranged he should do. In about half an hour s or so, Joe whispered to us to " cheese" it. ") I'm blarsted if thau'll get me to ' cap' any mosr t 'pokes;' dostt' 'ear? Does than want to have mo 'bellowsed,' eh? Here, thee ' cap, som on 'em look g wat I've emptied and chuck 'em way; leant hug 'ent i .about wi' me any more, cursed iv I do. I've more now L an wud set up a stand i' t' market!" (While we ware D talking the " moll" brought a couple more and tried to ' slip them to Joe.) "Nay I Im blowed iv I do; put 'em in than ' kick' or down than breast, or any other plaice thau 'as a mynd to; blarated iv thaa'll get mo any moar fur a porter." He " slung" me some back, and taking the " moll" on my arm I crushed and pressed my  way through the mass of visitors, and made my way to where sever ral figures stood dressed in the fashion of the day. Placing the "moll" in a position to screen me froca any chance of being seen, I qaickly deposited the empty puraes in the coat-pockets of the wax figurc., and left for another batch from Joe. All were ao8n got rid off, and at it we went again. From the lowe r room we went to the "  chamber of horrors," whenr figures of notorious murderers, and other such liko characters are exhibited. On the floor, and apparently mixing with the spectators, are the figures of the mur- derers Burke, Hare, and others, and into the ekirt pockets of these gentlemen we dropped the empty "ekins" got in this room. In fact, there was not a figure in the place wearing a skirt pocket, and which we could get at but had from one to three or four purses in his " kick." We had no other way of getting rid of them I  Fearing there might be such a thing Arc a "tumble," we thought it "cocarn" to slither, nr'd we slithered. When we got outside we hired Micab and drove home, where after sending out for the bee r, we tumbled every " kick" we had outside on theo table, and fell to counting the '" stuff." All we could mavko ofit, notwithtandicg the great number of " pokf b" brdught away, was only sixty two pounds and a few shillings. It was a emal. sum considering, bat JLO said, "' war a  great syght better's selling ' Enydo' cigars and rotten tobacco; an' iv it o'ny keeps ca lyke thia, we can maik enuff to start a beer shop i' Leeds-woint us, lass? But, si thee, can't we give thia plaico a  dresaiu every nyght till wo mak enuff fair ur ' gills' i'tead o' goia' anywherfs clIe?" I  answered that, in all tire tlmi I had bte: :le';:e   I never had seen so many people in there at one time  'before; and it might be weeks or months before such another crowd could be found there; and again, it might be as ciowded the following night, but these "akins" would be sure to be "cracked" about to the " cops," and an extra squad of' cops" would be on the look-out forsome time. It was best to letit die away before again trying it onthere. Aa for places to "graft," I knew plenty of them, and we would give them all turn about-that would be fair play. If they were willing, the next scene of operations would be the Polytechnic Hall in Begent street 5 after that we would give the Pantheon, the different baszars, the British aMuseum and National Gallery a turn, and surely after that we would have sufficient to " nem,*e" to Leeds or anywhere else, and then we would see what would be best to be done afterwards. Nextevening we took another run out on the " dip,' choosing the Polytechnie institution as the sceneof that evening's operations. We "slung our deenir" apiece, and in we went. Every night there was a cer. tain " fly cop" detailed for duty at this place alone; but having " squared"' him some months -previous to his being assigned this duty and while he was a " cop- per" in Oxford street, (a great business part of the town, and where we and most of the " flydipping mobs" in London;" grafted,") all of course was lovely, and we could do as we liked. This "cop" gave us the "office" as soon as we entered, for he stood at a place where he chuld ' granny" every " mug" that came in. Bo following him, he led the way to the rear of the bullding, and down a flight of steps into a dark chamber used-when Ut up inside-as a pictorial peep- show. Here he inquired of me who were those along with us, and if they were on the " dip." I let him know just how things stood, and that he could place dependence on Joe and his " moll," and also " stall" the little body himself, if he wished. An introduc- tion succeeded, and off we slithered to operate, Joe "stalling" me and the "fly cop cewsg" -the little "moUl-tool 1" "Dip" after " dip" came off in quick style, for we had nothing to dread, even should we "tumble a moll" and she " nose" to the people or to the attendants of the insttution, for our "stalling cop" would certainly see us clear of harm. Suaddenly A bell was rung, an. voices in different departments of the building were heard, infornming the visitors that the great " divrighell" performance was about to take placs. In a second, all were hurrying from up stairs and down to the end of the Great Room in the body of the hall, crushing, pushing and squeezing between each other, and trying who should be there first and have the best view of the bell and the divers. You may be certain we were buay while this was going on, and kept hauling away the " pokes" in galore. The exhibitors of the diving bell allowed any one, on the payment of sixpence, to take a dive; and while there remained a sufficient number to make the thing pay the bell was kept in operation. Seeing among the number awaiting the next turn for a dive, a coa;Aj   looking lady who appeared likely to carry a " stake," " officed" Joe, and upon the appearance of the bell above water we each " slung our tanner" and prepard to enter. Joe was'nt altogether " sweet" on this af- fair, and had he been asked to try the bell, would as. suredly have refused; but he looked at it in a strictly business manner, believingthat while at " graft" it was his business to stick to the " wire," without asking the reason of this or ththat. At first when he saw me Is ling my tanner" and enter the apartment set apart for those who had paid, he imagined I only meant " work- ing the push" around the bell; but when I gave him the "iffice" to follow me and the lady in under the diving bell, his eyes nearly turned from their solkets in amazement, and leaning his mcuth elae to my ear, whispered: "Is thau going i' that the4r thing? If thau is, than mon go thysen; blarsted 'gia if I'm goin' down the-ir to git chok'd alow t' water. Does thau heer? Don't. be a bloody fool l" and he pinched my arm. Bat I had seen the " poke flashed" by the " moll" when she was "slinglog her sprat" to the " bloke" of the bell, and I paid no attention to what Joe was saying, but fol- lowed my "mark"' in below the bell, and managed to -get seated alongside of her, and Joe, despite Jthe fear. f ful novelty of the affair, stuck to me like a good "pal" ti as he was, and there on my right he sat, wishing in.  wardly that the dive was over and both outside the : building. In a few moment after we were seated, the : concern was in motion, and gradually we were lowered b to the bottom of a deep tank made for that purpose. i On reaching the bottom, I began to " sling my hook," and had juat got the "poke".away from the " kick," -when the "moll" dropped her " duke" suddenly on mine and the " skin" in it. Here wasa fixl -" pinched to rights" with the " akin in my duke," several yards below the surface -of the water I No getting away 1- a sure " lagging" stared me in the face, and appar- entl; my career as a gpu" ended I What could I do t She still had hold of my hand with the " skin" dangling in it, when, as a last effort for my liberty, I suddenly wrenched her arm from its hold on my hand, amd she staggered off her seat and fell on the bottom of the tank, beneath the bell. An assistant who descended with us, immediately gave the alarm to those above by means of a cord running through an air-tight tube, and raising her up on to her seat we were drawn to the, ourfaceo, and then it was found that the lady had fainted. This, to me, was a fortunate affair, for it gave me time to get out of the inclosure, and off I bolted for the entrance. I soon cleared the door, and " nam. asing" into a ",lush drum" close by, " turned out tde poke" and " planted it down the duuniken." In a short time Joe, his " moll" and the " copper" enter- ed; for this was a regular " meet" for the " cop" and those who were " rybuck" with him, and when any. thing " came off," it was here they were to meet and , "put it round." I ascertained from Joe and the "laas" that as soon a. teo " mol'" ' ad recovered, she gave a * L'a"I abou; '" bhu ;i li; DPo^, " while doiva below,   sad this put all around " fly" and the " moll-tool" had to turn up I* graft." So we proceeded to " put about what sugar we made" among the four of us, " copper" included,in doing which a dispute ensued, the "fly c0G," being accused by the " moll-tool" of " sticking" to a " skin" for his own " gills." She had " slung" him seven, and he only turned up six " pokes," swear- ing like a trooper that that was all she gave him; but we knowing our own know, and determined to be even with him, let it slide for this time. The " sugar was whacked," and after a " shant" or two with the " cop" we parted from him, promising to see him at a confir- mation coming off on the following day in Padding. ton, where he said he was detailed for duty. He had told Charley McDonald and his " moll" of this "push,', and of course expected a share of their " dips," with- out which he wouldn't permit them to work. On the following day we attended church, and went through the "dipping" process toperfection, and again shared with him. Joe didn't like this system of paying away "sugar" to" cops." "Why doan't them lazy curses ' graft' for t' sugar' themsens, I'd lyke to knoah? Blarst 'em, they teak all t' profit off'n a feller's work, an' I don't see *em doin' anythin' for t' stuff wat they ' cop I' That the-ir fellow, McDonald an' 'I ' moll,' ' slung' t' bloody ' peeler' two ' quid' for '8s whack' and nz has dun the same. I'll turnm cop' mysen!gia I'm to git ' sugar' fur doin' nowt l That nightwe again visited Madame Tuasuad'i Wax- work Exhibition, in Baker street, and again it was crowded with visitors. Upon entering I noticed a suspicious-looking individual standing near the door- way, and resolved to keep my eye. upon him, for I had no doubt he was a " cop" in disguise, and planted there to " granny the mugs" of all who entered the rooms. Soon I observed a well-dressed gentleman going up to his side, and in order to .hear what they were i" croaking" about, I edged myself close to them and overheard what they said. "Have you observed anything yet i" said one to the other. "No, I've seen nothing suspicious to-night; I think they'll not trouble us for some time." A"Well, I'm going to the station to report and from there home; if you don't see anything soon, you can take yourself off, and follow suit, if you like." "All right," replied the other, and they parted.  This was soon after done by the remaining " cop," and the field was clear for " graft." At it we went, the three of us, and before many minutes Joe had his "kick" full of purses, the contents of which were trans- ferred to another " kick." Well, we had to " plant" them somewhere, for Joe refused to " cop" any more until he got rid of what he had; so taking them, as on a previous occasion, I edged up to the skirt pocket of one of the figures and dropped in a bunch of purses; but, heavens! what was the matter. The purses, in- stead of lying cosily at the bottom of the figure'd pocket, fell with a j'ngling noise on the floor at my   feet. I immediately planted my foot on them, and When I had an opportunity I stooped and secured them unobserved, and walked away to another figare. Here [ repeated the trial of " plant," but-with the like re. sult. The bunch of " pokes" again fell at my feet. Heavens I there must be something in this. At this. moment I " twigged', our '" rybuok copper," and lift- ing the " skins" again from the floor, went over, to him, and while "croaking," 1"slung" them into his outside " kick." He knew nothing of this, but told me that the people, while dusting the figures through the day, had found the " skins" in the coat pockets of the figures, and after taking them out had cut the bot- toms out of every pocket on a figure I CHAPTEI  XXI.

They gave a promis- ing account of their adventures while there, and ended by saying thatwere it not for an accident that befell their " wire," they would have stayed longer in the "Iand o' cakes ;" but as it happened, their "wire" bruised or sprained his " grafting duke" by a fallfrom a railway car when getting away after a " dip," com. ing ia at one of the stations. This couversatics took place at Fred Hogg's, and before we went to ': ,koss" Joe and I had made up our minds to take & iru down to Scotland and see what it was up to; besides, we could easily take a steamer from there to Hull and be in Yorkshire at a jump. Next day we packed up ready what articles of clothing we intended taking with us on our tour; the rest we put all together, and expressed to the care of a well known party in Leeds, and the following morning we embarked on board the packet, bound to Now Haven, a steamboat station near Leith, Scotland. There were a good many pas. sengors on board, and, barring the Epoll of sea sick. ness our "moll tool" experienced, we managed to make a pleasant passage of it. Among the passengers on board was one old Scotch lady who had been to   London on some business connected with a will, and who was now returning, full of good spirits and her "kicke" well filled with cash. She was a canning old lass and very cautious of what she said or did; not- withstanding, she felt so elated with the goods fortune she had met with, that the whole of her business was, by degrees, confided to Joe's Judy, who happened to gain her favor by her great similarity and appearance to the old lady'a daughter. What the old lady made known to the " moll tooD' was committed to us, and we resolved to put the " wire" in operation at the first opportunity. We waited and watched, and watched and waited, again and again, but we could not get near her. She was as wary and cunning as a fox, and besides she kept her " stocking" in one of a pair of large saddle bag " kicks" under her petticoat, and when taking her seat would hitch the "kick," in which the " sugar" was, under her hip. "That the-irs tu 'leery' a 'moll' fur any 'un to dip,' , said Joe. "We mun gie't up, air. Si thee  at t'owd hay bag 'ow she's whippin' her ' prat' o' top on it every tyme she sits down? Nay,lad, she meens keepin' it the-ir, an' a doaen o' waggin' 'orees uadn'; drag it froo' 'er." This seemed likely to be the case, and I was about giving up all hope of it ever " coming off," when a happy thought struck me. Joe's " moll" was quite at home along with the old lady, and the old lady was Se same in our Judy'scompany. Why couldn't there be something made out of thist I thought it was worth atrial, anyhow, as there was, to all appearance, a heavy " stake" in that old saddle bag " kick" of ters, else why so careful over it. But we'll try, and tf we fail, why then it won't be for want of looking after. The old lady had a travelling bag along with her and several paper parcels; and from the information we received from our Judy, one of those parcels contained garden seeds of choice variety. Well, the plan I suggested was this (speaking to Joe and his "moll"): *"As the old lady Eeemed so fond of you, try before leaving the vessel to engage her to show you the way to Leith, and as she is going there herself, of course she'll comply; then volunteer to carry the large parcel of seeds. This she will very likely allow yoa to do, and when you get to a place on the way which will suit us, I'll give the " office," and then you will immediately tear a hole in the parcel, and stumble and fall. Don't be in a hurry picking up the seeds; then "Equare" yourself as you best can, and take the omnibus to Edinburgh, about a mile and a half from Leith, and in one of the boxes of the Theatre Royal you'll find Joe and me. This was the only likely way I could think of just then, and soon after we wera in a'ght of the Chain Pier at New Haven; or at least tie place formerly called the Chain Pier. Woe now told the Judy to varmooso to the old " moll" and "pal in" with her. According to instructions off she went, and we "  piped" her cff to see how the thing worked. It tcck c  girmmugly, ane just as we came alongside the   landing the seed bag was called for by our little trunip and handed to her. So far so good, but this was nothing to rely upon-no guarantee for a sure and profitable denouement, and we anxiously looked for an opportunity. It was no use trying to " touch" her at the break of the boat as she would jerk away from anything approaching to cls3eness of position and wait until the party near her had passed. She was a "sly" old scrub, and we thought it proba. ble that she had gone through the mill before. How. ever, we saw her go ashore and, in company with our "molley," whocarried her seed bag, waddle along the pier. At a certain point on this pier there is an office, or rather a toll-bar, where every passenger -has to pay either a sixpence or a shilling for the privilege of land- ing on the Grantham Pier, as it is called. This, as a general thing, is unknown previously to the passen- gers, and many are the objections made to it by those who have paid their passage and expected to be taken to where they paid for, without further charge; but it's no use-either pay or go back to the boat. When we arrived near to this toll-bar, still close in the rear of the old lady, I whispered to Joe to have " sugar" enough in his " duke to " sling" for both of us; and watching my opportunity, just as the old lady was re. placing her " poke" after " slinging" her toll, I 4' of- ficed" the " moll-tool" and down she dropped, the "seed" running and scattering all around her. A something between a squeal -and a yell told how the old lady felt over the accident that was depriving her of her cherished seeds, and hastily ramming the "poke" into her saddle-bag " kick," stooped to securo what remained of her seeds in the parcel. This was our time-not a moment to lose-and " offlcing"' Joo, we closed in, and before her clouts had reached the ground they were on my arm, and a couple of " reefs" brought the " poke" within my grasp. A momentary glance to see that all was " square" around me, and the bag was off. There was no necessity for " sling. ing"' it to Joe, as it had come off " ryebuck." fSo, taking his arm, we walked along the pier and outside, where were a number of omnibusses and hacks await- ing the arrival of the packet. Into one of those hacks, we jumped, and in a minute were on our way te Edin- burgh. As we rattled along we turned out the " poke," and oh! gemini Hone hundred and forty-five pounds in Bank of England notes in one end, and three "quid" and some " pewter" in the other. "That 'll du," said Joe in ecstacies. "Thunner me blind I iv this 'ere aint t' best kuntry we've bin in yit; wy  didn't uz cum 'ere before?-iv r z keeps on at this gait there'l be nowt left far that ' wire' an's 'mob' wat sprayned his ' dipping duke,' will the-ir?" We were laid down at a hotel in Prince's street, an d after paying cabby we ordered dinner, after which w( traveled about town for an hour or two, vi;lting Ca4I low Hill, the Castle, and other places of interestr ; ther returned to our hotel and proceeded to ' rig, our, selves for the "' graft." We3 were early, ani cxpeotec   to have to wait some time before our lady found her way to where we had directed her. But lo I in one of the front boxes there sat the little syren, grinning in high delight at our approach. "It's ' come ofr my lass," said Joe, seating himself beside her; " it's " cum off,' and puttie 'eavy tu. Si thee! 'pype' this I Than dozent see t' lyke o' this growrn' i' t' tops o' trees, duz thou, lass-eh? ' and he "flashed" a fistfull of " screens." "Put it in your pocket, Joe; this is a wrong place to "flash sugar,'"- remarked. "Well, let's leev t' plaice. Who cares abowt t' play? I'm soor I don't," said he. "I'd rayther talk a walk throo t' town than stay 'ere. An' I say, my lass, has thau had owt to ' chuck' sin' thau left t' boat? 'Cause if thau 'asn't, just go an' put on thau traps, an I'll tak thee t' plaice whe-ir thau'll fynd more'n thau can cram intu thee, dost t' 'ear?" She replied that she had called in at a confectioner's and got all she required, and would rather remain and see the play, if he was willing. "Well, all ryght, mi chucky, thau sal stop and see wat's goin' on, and so'll I, too, an' i' the m-orn we'll he up an' at ' graft'--eh, lass? This is t' kuntry!

Wo stayed only for the first piece, "Rob Roy," and feeling rather tired, betook us to our hotel in Prince street, where, orderiog, a private supper and a bottle of good wine for three of us, wo spent a very pleasant evening, alternately drinking better luck to the old lady that "blewcd " the "poke'," and to our future undertakings. Next day we all went out on a pleasure excursion, having hired a brougham for the occasion. While driving about town we observed a crowd of people making their way all in one direction, and upon in- quiring the cause of it, were told that the Queen was expected to arrive in town that day, on her way to Balmoral. Here was a good opportunity to make something, but what could we do with the horses and carriage? It might be handy to have them near in case of a "tumble;" but as we never, or at least very seldom, counted on "tumbles,'" we laid that aside, and finally thought it would be the best plan to leave them in charge of som6 livery stable keeper, and take the hoof ourselves on the "1 buzz." So off to a stable we drove, in the vicinity of Holyrood House, and left our jaunting machine in charge of the stable keeper. From there we hurried to the railroad station, where the royal lady was expected to arrive, and thero we found a very large throng of people awaiting the Queen's appearance. In among this "push" we slid, and began   "pulling away" in double quick, and before the Queen's arrival we had taken seven " tricks," which we sent off with Joe, t-   "sling in the " danniken'r" of the nearest " lush. drums" he could fird, and at his return wo had three more ready for him to " swag." Soon the cars came in view, and thinking we had done enough "btz" i' In that quarter of the town, off we started for the neigh- borhood of Holyrood House. We got to Holyrood House in a fUw minutes with the aid of a cab, and alighting at the foot of the Can- nongate awaited the Queen's appearance-for she wBs to stay that night in the ancient Scottish palace of Holyrood. There was an immense number of people assembled here, the greater quantity being of the higher class, and among these we expected to " rake" a good thing. Soon the arrival of the Queen was made known, and every one edged closer to eecure standing room and a fair view. Now we again put the " wire" in motion, and before the Queen bad fairly passed had secured as many "Ekins" as we thought it was prudent to have in our possession, and, we agreed to "I cheese" it. So off we went to where our driving apparatus was housed, and " slinging" fot the keep of the machine drove off to the Links. When fairly on the outskirts of the city we pulled rein, and turned oat what " sugar" there was in the " skins." The amount was not half what was expected, owing, I suppose, to the fact. that sight-seeing people never carry Eo much " tin" as those who are travelling or shopping; yet we felt satisfied with what we had now. We spent that evening in promenading up and down Prince's street, the " moll" arm-in-arm with Joe and myself; after which we entered our hotel, and out Judy feeling tired was shown to her apartment. Joe and I staid up an hour or so later, and passed the time in reading and smoking, with an occasional " wet" by way of variety. While looking over the evening paper I chanced to place my eye on a heading beginning with "' Look out-for Pickpockets," and underneath it ran as follows : "AlIdv who came as pasPenger from London to Ediuburgh by the eteamn p cket ----, lost her puree yeater even while on her way from the boat to the end of the pier. It contained nearly one hundred and fifty pounds in Bank of Eugland notes, and it is strong- ly suspected that some London pitkuockets followed I her from London and robbed her. ute had it safe a few minutea after leaving the boat, and before reach- ing home discovered her loss. There is supposed to be a clue to the robbers, and we hope that our clever detective, McElevey, in whoseo haund tho information is placed, wil succaed in arresting those light fingered gentry, who have so lately troubled our respectablo and honest cit"'znB s" Holy Father i ( thonught to myself,) I wonder if we'll be smoked out.? and "offcing" to Joe, I walked out of the hotel, Joe following me. When we were a short distance from the hotel I took Joe's arm, and as we walked along I told him what I had read. "Well, then, we'd better 'ndmase' iv thau thinks there's owt lyke a chance o' ' pinchin.' I'm blarsted iv I'd lyke to get ' sloughed up' now, an uz almost ready to open t' ' crib' i' Leeds. Wat'sthau say-let's slither;' t' mornli t' some other plaice." "1 L ;loe," I said, "a tis best, in my opinion, to   leave this just now; and I'll ell you what we'll do.. We'll hire a conveyance from the hotel down to where the railway ferry boat crosses to Fifeshire, and when we get over there we'll take separate tickets to the town cf Dundee. There is a good chance of ' graft- ing' en that route, for there are many stations on the way, and when we get to the terminus on the Fife. shire side of the Tay there'll be a great 'push' awaiting the ferry boat, and we can ' graft' at our own price ; and in case we should lose each other, we'll meet at Wallace's Hotel, top of Union street. Myself and moll' have been there before, about two bears ago, and I know all the ropes; so remember and keep this in the chalk of your eye, for this may not be too safe a place for us. That McLevey or McElevey, or whatever he's called, is a clever ' cop,' and its best to give him a wide berth. If you're will- ing get all ready for the morning." The programme was settled between us, and soon we went to bed. In the morning, after breakfast, we inquired what time the train started from Fifeshire for Dundee, after which we hired a conveyance and drove off to the steamboat station, close to where we; had "dipped" the old lady. The steam ferry was waiting the arrival of the train on the Edinburgh side, and as soon as the passengers for the North were en board off we started. There was a considerable number of passengers on board, bound for different points on the route, and as we gained the Fifeshire side of the Forth all tried to be soonest ashore. This caused a "push," and as I had my bag to carry, the "moll tool" was the only " dip" at " graft" just then. In the " push" she?' brought away" two " skins," which &he "slung" to Joe, and then we made for the ear' station, where Joe found a " dunnakin" to "plant" the empty " pokes" in. We took our tickets for Dun- dee, and in a few moments were rattling along and through Fifeshire. Three or four hours ride brought us to the ferry on the banks of the Tay, and again there was a " push," and Joe asked me if I w&s " go. ing in." I declined, for I had noticed a sharp looking "bloke'" keeping us in view for some time, and when he noticed that I " had" him, he made a 1" stall" to ask me if that was the ferry boat to Dundee. I A" gammoned" not to " tumble" to him and said I be- lieved he was. Whether this answered or not, he left me and proceeded ahead on board, I keeping my eye on every movement of his. As soon as he got on board he slunk behind the chimney stack, and there be kept " piping:' us " off," but he might as well have Paved himself the trouble, for we " had" him, and that was sufficient for us. No amount of asugar" would have enticed us to " graft" just then; so, over we went, and while getting on shore (knowing that the "' cop" was at our "prat" and "' ear-wigging,") we acked loudly for the direct train to Perth. There was no direct train to that place, those cars only go- icg as far as Daundee; but it served to throw the "cop" off his scent if he was on us, which I believed he was. As soon as we got across the oars wer    taken possesion of bytthe steamboat passengers, and ltckily for us the " cop," who had gone behind the station for a private purpose, was too late to i' col- lar" the train, and we steamed off without him. It was only two or three miles from the ferry to the town of Dundee, and thinking there might be some one "put on" by means of the Telegraph, Joe and I, "rung togs," and agreed to meet separately at Wallace's Hotel. In a few minutes we were in Smoky Dandee. [Some cal it "Bonny Dundee," as for myself I, while we remained in it, couldn't see the beauty (Bonnie) that others have professed to see in it; Otill, we saw something. ] On our arrival each took a cab and drove to the hotel agreed upon, where, after our travelling bags were disposed of, Joe and I took a walk through the town. There was nothing going on of any conse- quence in the town, and without we could take a "trick " or two at any of the railwayf depots there, it seemed as if Dundee would be anything but a paying place on the " dip." In sauntering through the town, Joe and I had got down to the fish market, and while looking at the surprisingly large fish they had there for sale, we "piped " a "bloke " and his "moll" "sounding " the " kicks ' of the poor creatures there buying. We saw two or three "dips"/"come off," and the " stuff" " slung " to the " moll," who carried a "kypsey" (basket), and she immediately 'whip- ped" it into her own "kick," and when a half "tumble" occurred to her "bloke," she would "stall " between him and the monk, and price the fish. From what we saw we believed there was only a little " swash " brought off at each " dip,, and ' we thought it a pity for a brother " wire,' to throw himself away on such a small game as he was playing; besides, the poor creatures he robbed of their chilling or two, were unable to spare even that small amount, and we felt as if we would rather " sling" him a "deenir " or two than suffer him to " nail "- any more, of them. "Let's maisk 'im' cheese it,' " said Joe; " blast mi eyes iv I lyke ta see t' puir awd creeturs ' nailed ' of maybe their last ' bob.' Bi, thee X I'll ' gammon ' to be' a ' copper,' and ' nail i im on t' quiet, and thee see to t' moll.'"  "Very well," said I; "let's have a lark with him and his ' moll' for a few minutes.,' With that, Joe went up to him, and patting hin "duke " on the " wire's " shoulder, said: "Hers, I want to speak to thee a litte ; cum thii  way." The poor fellow turned a variety of colors, and punt on a beseeching look. "Cum this way," said Joe, authoritatively, and off ho moved him. His " moll " with the " kypsey " tried to "slide," but I quietly gave her to understand that she would have to follow her partner. "What's the meenin' o' this?" said she. "Oh, nothing much," said I; " but you'll hear all about it ' up-by ;' we've been watching you both over   an hour, and have seen every ' dip' you made, and [ three or four of the women will be waiting to identify, if possible, anything found on you." Poor thing I I was sorry with myself when I saw the tears come into her pretty blue eyes, and felt upon the point of turning up the " lark," but didn't know how Joe would like his "copping ' project spoiled. I saw her fumbling about her breast, and I " tumbled."' She had something there she wanted to get rid of on the quiet; so, in case she might " sling " any "sugu ar that she had chanced so much for, I eaid: "Now, I want yon to keep your hand away from your breast, for I know that you have something there you wish to get rid of; still, if you'd rather that I'd carry it for you, you can slip it into my pocket. Do. you understand me t'r I said this impressively, and she egain looked up with those beautifsU Szotch blue eyes. "Oh, maister, d'ye mean the richt thing?" said she, inquiringly. "Yes, I mean it," said I. An' ye'll no I snitch on me nor Wattie t" "I will not-I promise id; but be quick." A little hesitation, and she slipped into my coat pocket some. thing like a boy's marble bag. "Now," said I, " throw that basket down the next cellar we pass, and take my arm." She did so, and after walking a few yards I edged her into a whiskey shop. Here I called for a gill, and while she was wrapt in wonderment at this unusual stjle of hapolo. gy, I returned the bag to her telling her I thought she was too pretty to be locked up. !"But what's to become o' Wattie?" said ehe. "They're shair tae keep him, fur they a' ken him ' up. by,' an he's only oot twa days frae doing a ' sixty' " "Well, what is Wattie to you; you need'nt care, so long as you're safe. How long have you lived with him " "Oh, we're -aye bin thegither; we're twa twuns. He's my brither. Oh, sir, can ye dae onything for him? I'll gie ye a I've got gin ye'll git him oot o' this earape.' "Well, my pretty las, if you'll giva me one sweet kiss from those ripe red lips, I'll go and deliver' Wa- tie up to you unharmed?" "Wall ye; Oh I wh ye, sir?" 'Yes, I promise my word." "Here, tak it than, tak it, an' twa o' thim l"--and she held up two of the loveliest lips that ere was placed in woman's keeping. It was too much to keep this up any longer; so telling her to remain where she was, I'd go in search of her brother Wattie and bring him to her. I soon get Sight of Joe near to a dram shop, standing langhing all over hia face at the lark, and upon mentioning to Joe that the girl wished to see her brother, we all returned to the " whuskey; shop where I had left her. As soon ashe saw her brother 6he jumped up, saying: "It' a' richt, Wattie ; it's a' richt. They're no gaun tae tak u--he's promised it."   f "Tits, womunl haua ye'r blather; they're no "pega" a' tal They're on the " sash" themsells, an' il's only on fan they're doin this." But this from Wat tie did not satisfy her until we repeated it to her. "My gosh I did ever enybody see the like o't; wal I'm shair I I an hardly beleeve it. Lit's hae aither gilL" CHAPTER XXII.

Another gill was Brought on, and after that another followed, until all idea of " graft," for that day at least, was suspended. As for me I busied myself en- tirely in Jessie's company, the name of our new ac- quaintance, and when we arose to depart, she priva 'cly gave me an invitation to visit her at Ler home in tho Scouting Burn (prcnounced 'Skoorin' BurD. I was too well pleased with her company to allow her to depart oa such a short intimacy, and hinted that I would be highly favored by being permeitted to accom- pany her then to her home, where we could sit and "crack" without fear of being " ear-wigged." "Weel," said she, 1 I1ll jiat ax Wattie, an' gin he's wilta' no am I," With that she called her brother who was walking in advance along with Joe, saying: "Wat, I want to Epeck wi' ye a wee bit.

"I'll no seck; fhat's th' use noo, an' us a'maist the-ir?" answered Jessie. We had now reached a part of the town called the west part, from which the street called the Scouring Born led in a westerly direction. It is a miserable part of the town and inhabited mostly by fl x-dressers and factory families. In an opening leading from the Itreet to the back slums beyond, our leaders, Wattle Eid Joe, entered. "Where are they going now?" said I to pretty Jesaie, not for a moment imagining we had to enter such a den before reaching their abode. "Oh, that's our ' close' ye kin; we've to gang throo there afore we git tae the stairs; ye'd better mind yer shoon, for there's an awfu' heep o' dabs i' the 'close i '" "Dubs," "dubs," thought I; what does she mean by dubs? I hadn't long to wait for an interpretation of the word, for in a second after I entered the " close" I was over the shoe-ties in a quag-mirs, the con. tents of which consisted of a mixture of all sorts; and as soon as I lifted one foot out of one hole I imme. diatcly dabbed it into another. This was pleasant, certainly, and the stench of the disturbed deposit- Phe-u-w I As for Jessie she stood it like a brick, and giggled at my unseemly appearance and soiled con- dition. "Yes'r no' uaiz'd tae g, sin throo ' closes' I'm think. i? said she;!" but gin ye bide long i' this town ye 'll iu n ken a' aboat it." "Heaven forbid," thought I, and were I only near a Loot store I'd purchase a seemly covering for my feet. Fhe led the way, and soon we were Close in the rear of Wattie and Joe, the latter of whom, upon seeing tne, drew his " stook" from his coat " kick," and hold ag it close on the nasal department, cried out: "Well I'm blarsted if this 'ere doan't beat Boot and S'hoe Yard t' Kinkgate, 'allow 1" The girl again laughed and Ifollowed suit, for I just C then discovered that Joe had been dabbling in the -young cesspools coming through the " close," and was i- about as bad a plight as myself. We crossed a  yard and came to an old building, with an outside 1 nricketty wooden staircase leading to a flat or landing, X which shook again as we walked along it towards the v ,door at the end. By, this time the girl and I were , laughing quite loud, for she took all this in a happier t way than did her brother. Joe, despite of his fix-for d there was nothing cropped Joe so much as having his ; boots in a soiled state-chimed in with us, and while a Jthe brother "  unsloughed the jigger" we three joined in a   chorus of laughter which brought oat all the a ' neebors.  Wattie soon had the door opened, and-in we went. p Sch a   e" crib 1' A couple of old chairs, with ropes a and strings crossed and tied in every imaginable way S ' to save the party who sat on them from going through n the upright of the backs, together with three or four a   ; creepier   O, or  a-col, wa, all thea furniture in this Scotch "gan's" domicile. W attie handed Joe and I a chair (!), It and we were on the point of seating ourselves upon them when Jessie, with a broad smile, cautioned us, e saying: g  "Take cair hoo ye fling yersells inta them au!d' t things.

On the mantle. piece, or what bad once been such, a few penny pie. r tnres and " bawhee stookeys" intermixed with snarls r, of thread, odd bits of knitting worsted, and other and more heterogeneous fixings, served to embellish that o part of the house, while in a dark recess in the corner i into which Wattie had gone, I instinctively observed e something like a bed, but dared not approach any nearer " takin' notes," fearful of the Egyptian plague, a or it might be the Scotch Fiddle, alias the Yook. Wat. I tie soon emerged from the dark corner with a large , whiskey bottle in his hand, and told Jessie to litcg the fire while he went out for the whiskey. This she set I about doing, and before her brother had cleared the yard on his errand I gave Joe the " office," and out he , "namased," leaving Jessie and I alone. I had taken - a fancy to this pretty Scotch girl, and knew that if she I was only rigged up as she deeerved, she could tako down all the " picking-up," and worn out heifers fre. quenting Fred Hogg's and Bugger Tom's ; and could I but gain her consentto " namase" with me 1 thought  , I could stick to her for ever. So I resolved to try. "Jesie, I would think that you'd get tired living in this town all the time; besides, you can't expectto work in this one place always, for the 'cops,' or- ' pegs,' as you call them, will get so well acquainted with your face that they'll ' nail ' you on the first op- portunity. Why don't you make up your mind to travel? Look at us. We travel all over the kingdom, and only lately have returned from Prance; we see everything, and want for nothing, for we can always obtain money in the places where we go to seek it; but 'tien't in a fish-market we'd seek it, else we'd be a long time in ' nailing ' enough to buy such articles as those"-and I  drew the " spark fawney" from my finger, and held it towards her. She took it in her hand and examined it, asking what kind of a thing it was. When I told her it was a diamond ring she stared in astonishment, and again examined it. I told her to try it on her finger, which she did, and was delighted at the, result. "Would you like to have that ring to wear, Jessie, and fine silk dresses and such like?" "  Yes," she replied; " but I dinna expeck ony thing o' th' kyn; ye. see Wattie hes only bin out twa or three days, an' a' th' time he was ' up-by,' we had to pawn and sell everything i' th, hoose, an' it'll tak him a   lang time to mak as muckll's get half o' th' things oot. So I dinna expeck ony silks or diamond rings, nor naethin' o' that kyn," she replied, with a sad kind o! a-smile;   "Well, I'll tell yonu what I'll do, Jessie. I'I be hon- eoat with you; I'll buy you all the dresses and other things you may require, and I'll give you this diamond ring for your own use, and whatever money you want, and I've got plenty of it (showing her a bunch of bank notes), and I'll take you to London and all over the kingdom with me, and you shall live like a lady if you'll only say you'll come with me-.will yon? Now say the word." She hesitated and said: "I canna tell, I'm shair; When Wattie comes in I'll speer gin he's willin." "Well," said I, " will you try to persuade him to let you come along with me, and tell him if he consents I'll give him enough money to buy a respectable suit of clothes, and advance him a few pounds, and along with that we'll take him as one of onrselves, and he shall travel with Ws." I felt like promising everything rather than lose Jessie. " o Weel," she replied, "I'll try, gin ye say that Wat- tie's tu cuam wPs." At this moment we heard Wattie and Joe returning; so, taking a kiss over the bargain, I seated myself in the creepie, while Jessie busied herself on her hunk. ers in front of the grate (!) trying to raise a flame -by the aid-of a no-nozzle bellows she whaffed with. Warm water was soon obtained, and we began drinking toddy. After we had finished the second half mutchkin, the rest of the family came home from the mill, where they'd been working all day. There were' the mother, two sisters and a boy. Wattie explained, to them how matters stood, and a whole mutchkin was now Sent for, Joe and I paying for everything. Jessie would have me fit on the diamond ring on her finger once more, that she might show her mother how she "Iooked in it," and many were the exclamations of surprise at the beauty of the article. *'Mycertiesl but that's a braw ring, Jessie; but it'll be mony a lang day afore you or me wears sic a thing o' oor ainm" a^ "Dinna be sae shair o' that, maither," and in a whisper she added, "I cud hae that mysel', this very nicht, gin I wanted it-what di ye think o' that?" "Lash keep's a', hoo can ye mak that oot, Jes- sie?"'  "Oh, I ken; I've only tue say the word, an' I can get it, an' mair beside 1" .Then followed a whispering which I could not hear. We were all getting quite merry, and several of the neebors were called in, and mutchkin after mutchkin was sent for. The old lady was in high glee, and made Jessie sit beside me all the time-tho very thing I desired. Just then another neebor came in, and the whusky was again put in motion. "Losh, Mrs. --- , I thocht there was a waddin' goun an here, an' I jist cuam ben tae see wha 'twas phat was gettin' mairred,"' said the new comer. " Weel," answered the old woman, " hoo d'ye ken but what thir wuld be a waddin' afore the nicht's oot, eh, Jessie?"t I thought I now saw an opportnnity for me to act;   so starting to my feet I took Jessie's hand in mine, saying, "Well, if Jessie's willing so am I." The old woman thei, whether out of fun or in reality, took upon herself the office of clergyman and married us by joining our hands together; and putting my diamond ring on Jessie's finger, she pronounced as man and wife, amid the cheers and greetings of the neebors. More toddy, and more toddy, until almost every one in the " close" was piddled over the marriage of Mre. --'s docker, and after a wee ema' hour atween the twal,' the " but-and-ben"' neebors staggered to their domiciles. As for Joe and myself, we were too far gone to venture an appearance at the hotel, and be- sides, was I not married, and in the house of my bride's mother?-what need I care. A shake down was arranged for Joe and I, and soon my " chum" was in the Land of Nod. But I couldn't sleep; the thoughts of my Jessie drove sleep from me, and I lay still and awake, observing all that occurred. We had left a considerable quantity of *,husky on, the table, and after Joe and I were " dossed," the old lady, Jes. sie and two of her sisters gathered around itand it wan "spoiled." About an hour or so after I lay down, and after they had finished the " max," the old woman was led to bed, after which followed the two sisters, and Jessie was left alone; her brother Wattie had given up some time before and was lying drunk under the table; the light from the " cruzie"  was burning dim, and I could see the faint streak of morning light breaking in, when I resolved to turn up my shake- down. So up I got, and stealing over to where my Scotch bride was Bitting sleeping with her head rest. ing on her hand on the table, I gavei her a morning salute on her pretty ripe lips. Why shouldn't I? She was mine according to Scotchlaw, and who bad a bet- ter right to. This awoke her, she started, but seeing it was me, said nothing. I thought that a walk would not harm us, and besides I had something to say to her which I did not wish to be " earwigged." So I asked her to accompany me for a short walk until the others got up. She consented, and jast as the early dawn began we left the domicile, but not before I had " collared ' Joe's "stuff" from him, and written a note for him on asheet from my pocket-book, informing him where I was going and that I had his " sugar," and not to leave until my return.  Jessie and I took our walk by tho banks o' Bonnie Tay, and when buaness had begun in the town, I took her to a first class milliner and there paid for a complete outfit for m3 darling Jessie, after which we returned to the " crib," man and wife in. deed! I informed Joe of my intention of taking Jessie with me wherever I went, and he felt glad at the informas. tion, as she would be company for the little "moll tool" whenever Joe and I were absent. About the middle of the day we left-I to change my clothes and Joe  to quiet the fears of his Judy, who had been left all alone in a strange place and uncertain what had befallen us. Afterwards the three of u walkcd   up to the Scouring Brn and into Jessie's. It was with difficulty we prevailed on the " moll-wire" to enter the " close,' its appearance being anything but inviting; but at last she consented and Joe and I carried her in over the puddles and sinks until we landed her clean on the ricketty stairs. Here we were met by Wattle and his mother, and further on in the doorway stood Jessie smiling her welcome to us all, but more especially to me I thought. Joe's Judy had a creepie set for her as soon as the introduction was over, and then the toddy began again to circulate. There was a marked difference in Jessie's demeanor from that of the day previous, owing I suppose, to herearlty risingr that morning. But then all this was certain to wear off, and every- thing would again take its natural course. I saw Jessie had the " spark fawney" on her finger where I had put it when her mother married us, and other arti. cles she wory which I had bought her that morning, in which shelooked pretty indeed. Her mother had staid at home that day from the mill, afraid that she was going to leave her right away, and upon that sub- ject the old lady called me aside to speak; for it ap- peared, after Joe and I had left for the hotel, Jessie told her mother that she was going with me whenever I went and wherever I'd go. and gave her peculiar reasons for so doing. I promised that I would not leave Dundee for a week or so, and this seemed to Eatisfy the old woman somewhat; but I told her that while I remained in town, and henceforth, Jessie thould occupy apartments which I would provide for Ler and myself. I had taken apartments for Jessie and myself (hav- ing left Wallale's HoteD at Lsmb's Hotel, in the Mur- raygate. After seeing all the sights of Dandee, the week that we had promised to stay there was about up, and we had pocked up ready for departure on the following day; and as Jessie was about leaving her family for an unknown period, we thought it but right that we should spend the last day with her relations. So my bride and I dressed up, and calling at Wallace's Hotel for Joe and his " moll" we all started for the Scouring Bum. The neebors were again called in and a general booze took place. Ia the afternoon I no- ticed Wattie putting on a different and tidier suit of clothes than he wore while we wera there-which, by the way were brought out of " lumber" with part ef the money I had made a present of to the old lady, and he seemed to busy himself on the quiet, and I thought thathe intended leaving Dundee along with us, I took Jessie en one side and asked her concerning him. She told me that this being market day, Wattie I meant trying his " duke" in the market. I knew he had been "lushing" too much that day to be able to see his way clear on the " buz," and I tried to prevail upon him to turn it up for once; but it was of no avail, for go he would, and so off he went. His mother and Jessie were also afraid of him, and aaked Joe and I to follow and again try to persuade him to leave it until another day. So telling our Judien we would soon re.   turn, we started inquest of Wattie. We came up with him in the overgate while he was talking with some half " crossecoves." It was not our intention to mix in with this " showful" set, and we were trying to pass them by when Wattle," luashy" like, called upon us to stop, and immediately presented us as friends of his, and volunteered to " max" the company. Anywhere was preferable to standing in the street with such a squad, so in we went and more " lshing" followed. Our endeavors to persuade Wattle proved fruitless; but he promised that if we would accompany him as far as the market he would " turn it up" after the first "dip." For his safety we consented, and walked with him to the market. Here there was a good "push,' and Wattie sailed in, we keeping at a distance, and re. solving to have no hand in such a " meezlgy affair. At the first attempt Wattie " tumbled" the "moll;'" "beef" was given and half a dozan voices joined in the cry of " hand the ' keely' (thief), haud the 'keely' he's pickket-a-pakket: baud 'im." Joe and Iran up to see whether we couldn't "' jolly" him away, but at the first attempt we found our collar in the grip cf two detectivesl "Here, we want you twa birdies," said they, and in the midst of our dignified remon. strance we were choked off ia the rear of Wattie to the Lock-up. The charge was booked against Wattie as principal and we as accomplices, and in they shoved us, each in separate cells. Here was a fine fix I Lock- ed up in a darkstinking cell-my bride awaiting my return--ad the honeymoon not half over yet 1 Hfel bad I In an hour or two after we were " sloughed up,") a red-headed Scotch " cop" came to the outside of my cell door, and opening a small eye-hole that worked with a spring, called me to him and began "pump- ing" me. "Halloa," said he, in pretended surprise; " what iv th' doin' wi' you here I What ir ye in for, eh?" I told him that I had been brought there, as I sup- posed, on suspicion of being an accomplice,of the young man in the next cell, and that was all I knew of the charge. "Weel, I'm soarry tee see sic a respectable young man as you are in sio a place as this-I'm soarry in. deed. Hae ye ony freens aboot here I 'cas if ye hiv, I'll dae onything tCiat lies i' mi pooir taoe let them k n o' yer fix, an' maybe they'll git ye oot. Whir diz yer folks bide?" He knew I had money, for they " frisked ,' me and Joe before locking us up; but, fortunately, the notes that we "  pinched " from the oll lady at the pier in Edinburgh were safe in the bag at the hotel, and when questioned as to our residence, we had refaed to an- aswer that question. He had come to the wrong door when he entered on thiserrand of " pumping." I had been asfar "North" as he had been, but I didn't choose to let him think I  was "fly" to his "kid,'" and answered that I wouldn't for the world distress my family by letting them know I wasn i muoh a place; but if he'd be kind   VAlsh to bring me in something to eat and -drink, I'd ' Vk   it worth his while ia the morning when my bey would be returned to me. Hoe answered that U was afraid to do it, as it would be against the aB6-but" he'd try." After a few more attempts'at -0lkid," and failing to draw anything from me, he hand went to Joe's cell. I listened and heard him ;p!at the like " kid " to Joe, but he was soon bluffed A'itere, and he went away as wise as he came. A Wb hours after a pair of drunkards were brought in, ax thefore opening my cell door a pretended squabble wesd between the person about to be locked up *i the turnkey-the drunken man refusing to enter e ,'i, when a few more " cops " were called, and & . ioeir united help; in they threw him, and the door u1oked as before. My drunken cell-mate banged -*tke door, and swore like a trooper, after which he *isttted himself down on the top of me. HiBulloa!" said he, in great surprise, " what in *oaer's this I wha's heer 'I and he felt all over me as Zf gizg to make out whether I was a human being or :*athing else.

What's your opieneon about it, chappy?1" It can't give any opinion, my man," I replied, "for I never had any experience in such business, and hope I never will." A hour or so was spent in endeavoring " to draw me out," but it was no use, and at last he got up and pocked at the cell door. The turnkey came and Red what was wanted, upon which the " pumper" said in a loud whisper, so that I could hear: "I :y, turnkey, iv I tell a' I ken aboot this job chat I',n locked up fur, wull you let me gang aboot zi bisniz?' "I Weel, I daur say they wull, but cuam oot here an, 211 tak' ye afore th' offishers, an' gin ye tell th' truith ye'll no hae tae cum back"-and he opened the cell door and out walked the foiled " peeler"I suppose ;tXoldc the truth for he never came back.

Ia the morning we were taken from our cells to the court-room in the same building and arraigned before his Honor as accomplices in the " dip" with Wattle. A great deal of tall swearing was gone through with on the part of the Scotch 1" cops" that had us. (I had often before, and have since then, been in custody for different offences in England, but never have I experienced such an utter disregard for truth as was shown by those infernal villains of " skufters" in Dundee .) They swore that Wattle, whom they knew to be a " habit-and-repute" thief, tried five or six times to rob as many different women; and that after Joe and I had tried three each, we then covered Wattie while he was attempting to rob the woman he was now charged with I! This was talltswearing, and no mistake, and we were making up our minds for a pretty long term, when Wattie asked the magistrate to allow him to speak the truth. He was permitted to give a statement, which was to the effect, that having metua and drank with us, he took in hand to show us through the town, and that while doing so he, of his own accord, went ahead of us and committed the offence without our knowledge or aid. Whether this influenced the old fellow that sat on the bechk or not, we know not; but certainit is we got off cheaper than we expected, for immediately after Wattle got through I withhis yarn he sentenced him to sixty days hard la- i bor in Bridewell as a " habit-and-repute-common S thief," and turning to Joe and me, after a short lecture he whipped us:up for ten days each to the same dwell- b ing. About an hour afterwards we were under the t hands of the prison barber in the back room of the Dundee Bridewell. This official gave us to understand v in a whisper that he would not be severe in uncover- h ing our cranium, if we would only " sling" him a "wee" 1 bit o"' minchie" (tobacco); but as neither Joe nor I e were possessed of the "weed," we had to undergo the extreme penalty, and came forth from under the hands e of this Scotch lout, each with a head like a milliner's e block. r  The next performance was a doucing in the bath., at each end of which was fastened a box, one con   t^  soft sot 0ap and a scrubbing brush, the other aiz--vmsad, as large in the grain as Bra:il nuts, or snaetlf'ng less. This we were ordered to use on onr 3tK not that either Joe or myself required such a tig, for we were cleaner, Heaven knows, than s'.i sawho tood over us directing. "Blarsted iv I'm a goi' t' scrape Pi hide wi' such a :-c2,a7 said Joe to me, in a low whisper; " why dcan't z: g{ive uz broken bottles at onct? th' mxght at tr? slonching over, they now threw to each of us a la woolsey Jacket and trowsers, made up of innu 4Bmble patches or " cloots," said " cloots " being oWy, layered with tar on each knee and seat-the rwt of many a hard day's labor in picking oakum, -lVmer unfortunate wearers. An old blue wors ed rmy bonnet, regardless of size, was thrown to usfor L-s gearing, and a shirt with broad yellow, blue and "- ,s- stripes, and a pair (!) of worn down at-the-heel wa slippers completed, our outfit, in which we were lamhed off to our cells. Before locking the cell door &one got from the turnkey a hint thatt "S atil asoga showed a wise head "-no talking being al. led, but severely punished when detected; and ,V2out more ado the heavy iron door was banged to, lid and locked. When the cell door was shut on ,:1listened to hear where Joe would be taken to, iArto myr geat reRef I heard him " sloughed up ' 'Ite or four cells beyond me. I now took a "' granny" ar my aew domicile, and most certainly its fixings W   not riel, thongh rare. A equare piece of board, About a toot and a half in size, intended to keep the 2abAff the cold, bare flags, and a box of a very pecn. pattern, together with myself, was all the cell lefmtaded. But let us see-there might be Something /&*n box, and I opened it. Yes, there lay an old ie., musty and decaying; I took it out and laid it on the ledge of my eell window. NextItookoutabunch smnotted oakum, and below I found a few religious !:G t I exacmned them and found, -' Honesty'the A  Policy," "Sin no Trifle," "Time and Eternity," rb tiphar's Wife," "Prepare to Die," ,' Balshazzares uaat," and the "Dairyman's Daughter." The latter, -'ag with the Egyptian's " moll," I laid on one side ?s;perusal; the others were returned to their damp a- muddy resting-place at the bottom of the box. ZaLnother division of this piece of "stur" farniture, -Mbund a three gill tin cup or tankard. Such a tank. dl--foul, stenehy, and heavily coated with rust. 'Ved was to be my drinking-mug. Also, a short i -oken-handled horn spoon, with portions of decayed --atter from former meals adhering to its many cracks. I fuhgh I What a beastly place a Scotch " sturbin "I at I shut the box, and standing up on it I looked j iCm my cell window. In the yard below waa walking Xuale, hollow-eyed, thn jawed prisoner at exercise.  n"oficed " to him, and he made me understand by  ,- aa that he had been in this prison five months, and ;4d but one more month to starve there. What a dif.  attce there is in the appearance of Scotch and Eng. I    r liah pr7aouers? Ia the one, if a prisoner conducts r himself properly, he is well fed; in the other be is r well starved, no matter how he conducts himself. Joe 1 and I Lad eaten nothing since early the previous day 1 and now I began to feel rather " peckish," and thoughts cf bygone feasts of nice roast beetfWelsh rabbits, and a double X London porter, came into my head until I t almost fancied I could see it all before me, and, Mac- s beth like, I said "Let me clutch thee;' but (there was "she " to clutch), it was gone, " like the baseless F fabric of a vision." So to pass away the time I em. ployed myself in reading the pin-scratches on the ; plastered wall. When six o'clock came the turnkey commenced , opening all the cell doors, and each prisoner was told I to take in his bed, which had been brought by prison r help from the room where it was stowed away for the day, and placed handy at the cell door. I drew in my 1 " dossing" apparatus, and expected every moment to ; see some kind of supper. But no, sir, ne'era supper- rand I almost famishing for want of food I real toe I tracts over and over again to keep from thinking about grub'; still this would not do, so I prepared to try and sleep it off till morning. The bedding consisted of a hammock, coverlid, blanket and sheet, coarse and dirty in the highest degree; each end of the hammock was attached by means of an iron ring, to an iron hook in the wall, and there it swung like a half sack stretched. Imanaged, after numerous attempts and as many falls, to steady myself at last for a 1" snooze," and juast as I was dropping ff to sleep and everything was still, I was startled by a loud snap and a heavy thud on the floor somewhere close to me. This was followed by a volley of oaths and curses in real and unmistakable Yorkshire. By this I -knew that my "chum"Joe had met with an accident. The noise he made brought the night watchman under his window in the yard, who inquired what was the matter. "Wat's t' matter? Cum an' tfy'll see wat's t' mat- ter; I've near split my 'ead open wi' this 'ere hookum consarn, an' t' blood is aH over t' plaice. I want t' doctor or summit, else I'Ull bleed t' death." "Well, keep quiet and I'll go for the turnkey." Off he went for the turnkey and Joe's door was " ua- sloughed." "What's th' maiter here, my man? De ye no ken that ye'r liable tae loss ye'r dennir for makii' csio a clatter at this time o' nicht?" said the turnkey. "I'se think I'm moar loike tun ocz 3 all t' blood i' mi 'ead 'fore I can see ainy dinnur or owt Lke it. I've bin locked up sin jester afternoon, an' I haint 'ad a mouthful to eat sin, an' doant think I kan affoord to looze so mutch blood as this out sutch'n 'igh hviu'.'  replied Joe.          \ "Hoo cum ye tae dae that?" inquired the turnkey: "that'd an awfal nestle cut, an' ye'll hae t' has a dad o' stickin' plaister on't. Did ye fa' oot o' yer bed.?" "I fellout'n that the-ir thing, watever than callsit.': "Weel, I'll gang an' git ye sumthin' to stop the bluidin'. Bit see, ye maun hand yer head eower the   tap o' th' pat an' no let the bluid o' th' fluir, else ye'll hae t' gang 'ithoot yer parritch i' th' mornin'." He might as well have talked double Dutch to Joe, for he didn't understand him half. The watchman waited at Joe's cell until the return of the turnkey, who proceeded to stick on a " dad o' plaister," after which he gave Joe instructions how to enter his ham- mock without falling, and there left him. In the morning, at half-past five, we were awoke by the ringing of a bell, and being old stagers we knew this was likely to be the " office" to leave the " doss ;', go "officing" to each other, Joe and!" turned up; our sacks and got ready for a wrash. While washing at the end of the passage I had an opportunity of whispering with Joe, and came very near " blewing" my " chuck" over it, for when I noticed his nearly bald head starred with sticking plaster, I bursted out laughing, and with difficulty succeeded in gaining my cell without being " pinched," for laughing was a punishable offence. About seven o'clock our cell doors were opened and we were told to take in our brcakfast. Such a break- fast I A vessel, or cog, as they called it-something in the shape of a Datch herring barrel cut in two, and iron-hooped-was nearly filled with a stuff they called "porritch," made of coarse, dark oatmeal, and the space left on top filled up with treacle water by way of kitchen. Good heavensl I thought, have I to live on this stuff for ten days T It will surely " croak ' me; but I must try to get some of it down or V1I faint with exhaustion. I looked again at my horn spoon, but hungry as I was I could not use it; so I looked around and discovered a small wedge-shaped bit of wood, used to steady the foot-board, and with that I managed to swallow a few mouthfuls of the oat- meal plaster. The remainder I placed in the "cog" for the benefit of the hungry cleaners who were em. ployed in the passages. The next on the programme wai a large bundle of tarry oakum thrown in to me. This I was told must be picked as fine as the hair of my head by night, else there would be no " porritch " for me in the morning. One o'clock was the dinner hour, and you may believe I heartily longed for it to come. Come it did, and I was told to take in my din. ner, and there stood a " cog " nearly full of a wash they called kail, and beside it a flat circular piece of bread called a scone. When I brought the kail in to my box, I took my chip wedge, and with it dredged the bottom of the " cog," in hopes of bringing to the surface some  material for the teeth. But alas! I might as well have tried to scrape gold off a moon- beam-wash, and nothing but-wash I  However, it was much better than the plaster called " porritch," and I managed to find room for it-and more too, if I could have got it. This wasthe usual and daily courae of getting through the time, and at last our ten days were up, and our cells were "unsloughed," and we were told to " cum this wye, an' git yer claes." This order was gladly obeyed, and in a few minutes we were donning oaur superfine. Everything fitted as be.   n[ fore, with the exception of our hats, which fell over our eyes so far that we had to keep hold of them with , our fingers in order to see where we were walking. a Ten days had not made much show in respect to the , growth of the hair, and when we made our appear. r ance outside of the gates of the prison, our " moUls," who were waiting there for ua, set up a merry laugh at our comical cocoa-nuts, in which we joined. We V had refused to take in our "porritch" and treacle r water that morning, not caring to load our stomachs , with the black trash, and were now rampant for a ; gorge of something eatable. So into a porter house ; we dived, and called for two bottles of London porter, f and no end of pies, after which we all sailed off to , Jessie's in the " scouring-burn.1 Here the motherwas r awaiting our arrival, and busied herself in preparing t another feast for the two hungry jail-birds, after which , we liquored. But I was determined to keep my i weather-eye open this time, for I had had enough of Bonnie (I) Dundee. About noon I called Joe aside, I and telling him I wanted to go down town to ascertain if a steamer was going to Hu!l, he willingly agreed to ; go with me. So off we went, and when we arrived at I the docks, we found'that a vessel would leave next I day at high tide for Hull. We then and there pur- 3 chased tickets for the four of us, and returned to our r  "molls." I was afraid there might be some " plant " on us; so for the remainder of the time it was resolved ' that we would stay in the old woman's " drum," until I ready for starting to the steamer. That night we all i sat up together, and passed the time toddying and [ singing with our " molls." At last day broke in, antd I Joe and I dressed, ready for the passage. The " mols" i had brought our bags from the hotels the day after we were ' pinched," and placed them in charge of tho , old woman, With whom they lived whil we were * doing " ourporritch and kail business in "stur." The hour arrived for our departure, and in company  with the old lady (who would go to see us off) we en. f tered the hack and were driven away to the Hull ' steamer. On the way, and while passing along Union r street, we hauled up at a wig-maker's, and bought a wig each, for the " keelie" cut of our hair was a per- feact" crab" on us. We got safe on board, and imme. i diately stowed ourselves below in the cabin, out of f sight of any " cops," should they chance to come on , board. It wanted an hour of the time of starting, so I we ordered the steward to bring us a bottle of wine that we might drink the parting cup along with Jessie'l I mother, who made me promise to be a "guid man tao her bairn an' no see hir ill-yoixed," all which I faith- fully promised to perform. The bell gave the signal cf departure, and after embracing the old woman she hurried ashore, and in a few minutes we let the land of parritch and kail, where tho Irishman hid his ishilling in the-rear. We  had a very pleasant pamgg from Dande& to BHall, and, with the exception of a little sea sickness on the part of Joeys " moll," all went well. Aa for my Scotch lUsie, Jessie stood it bravely, the fat air   and rocking of the vessel having no effect on her a strongstomach. (She had been raised on oatmeal porritch and pease-broae.) On our arrival at Hull we called a hack and were driven to a friend of Joe's who lived in Silver street, a rather wide-awake locali- ty, and after everything was made straight, we all took a waall through Hull and done a little shopping for the "molls," more, however, with the object of getting oar Bank of England notes (which we had nailed from the old Scotch lady at Grantham Pier,) "smashed" than anything else. Next day, Joe and I went out on tho "spot," and for that purpose clad ourselves in different costumes to that we usually wore. Onr manner of operating was this: We each borrowed a countryman's smock from Joe's friend, and an old Billy cock hat, and taking a couple of " finaiff" (five pound notes) with ns, would travel about the town "grannying" aUl the " draumsi that were likely to be eBlly '"Cracked." The next &ting was to find out whether they had enough "sugar" to pay for the "cracking," and where it was kept. This we did by entering and examining a few articles they had for sale, after which we would purchase something and tender a " fianif." Ina most cases they wouldn't have sufficient change ia the till and would have to go to another part of the shop where tho " peter" was kept: and at the moment of taking the " smash" from the '" peter," Joe would advance and request the " bloke" to oblige him with "smash" for his " finniff." I Whether he could or not, Joe had an opportunity of "grannying" what the " peter" contained. If it was aatisfastory, the next thtg was to know where it was put at night when they left the shop, or whether it was carried home by the " bloke" of the " drum ;" and for this purpose one of us would hover about the store at shuttingaup time, and " pipe the bloke off." In two days time we succeeded in " spotting a drum to rights," and it was determined between us that it should be "done." It was a difficult Job to undertake, but Joe thought it would pay; so we prepared for it. In the first place Joe had not all the tools re qusite for the "burst." He had sent those he bought from Alex- ander in the " mint" by express to Leeds, from Lon don, and it was necessary to write to the friend there to forward them to Hull. This was done, and in a few days they arrived. We now took lodgings at a second class hotel, and bought a couple of trunks for the pur- pose of " swagging" the stuff we intended " nailing." Next, we put our " molls fig" to the part they would have to play in the affair, which was this : In the rooms they occupied in the hotel their windows looked into a back yard easy of access; from one of those windows they were to lower a bag by means of a rope, and after we had put what spoil we had into it, they would draw it up and pack all into the trunks. an the morn- Ing following, before there was time for a " stink," they were to cross from Hull to Barton, in Lincoln- shire, by the ferry boat, leaving the porter of the hotel to bring their trunks along in his wagon. Here we would be awaiting them with a conveyance ready   I to take them to the nearest railway station. The bag and rope we got them before they left us to go to the hotel; for we didn't " doss" along with them there, fearful that our absence from the hotel might be no- ticed while at " graft."!',Another day was passedin re- connoitering, and being satiefied all was "1 lovely,"we determined on " doing" the job that night. Late in the evening there came on a rain, and before eleven o'clock it came down in torrents. About this time Joe and I, well wrapt up and carrying the tools between us, sallied out of the beer-house we had been spend- ing the time in, on our hazardous expedition. As we passed along the forsaken streets, the wind, which blew fresh from the sea, beat the drenching rain in our faces, and compelled us several times to take shelter from its fury in several of the entries of the streets, while the rain ran from the bottom of our trowsers, as if from a spout, " oe,', said I, "don't you think, it would be the best plan to ' turn this up' for the night? Th:s is aw- ful weather, and my ' togs' are sticking to my Skin; let's ' turn it up' till another time." "Nay, blarsted iv I du," returned he; "duzc tHia reckon I'm a luny, t' go an' leev ' graft' wi' eutchn a goad chance loike this? Let it rain; all t' bettir. I doan't cair how match; or iv thau loiks bettir, than kin speel 'ome an' I'll do it moysen." This pricked me a little, and I resolved to brave all that Joe did. We again started, but it blew and rained as before, if not worse; but we were now as wet as we could be, and shoved right ahead.' At last we gaian ed the entry leading to the yard in the rear of the ' drum." It was now as dark as pitch, so much $- that I had to keep hold of Joe's arm, in case I'd lose him, for we couldn't see a yard ahead. We had "spot- ted" a place of entrance during the day, and made towards it by feeling along the wall and groping our way. We found it; it was a pair of stairs leading to a carpenter's shop in the rear and almost level with the wall of the yard we wished to enter. The top cf this wall had a eheau-de-.frse of broken bottles stack in line, which made it a dangerous at- tempt to try to get over it. But Joe, never without a resource when on the "burst," soon pryed open the carpenter's shop door, and in we went. When inside he fastened the door so that it could not be easily opened from without, and going to the window that overlooked the yard, lifted the sash and called me to him. "Hist duz thou 'eer? Cum   this waiy an' ow'd this 'ere up wile I git a 'stee' dadder in Yorkshire) iv the-ir is wun abeout. I'se reckcn the-ir is sutchna thing i' sutchen a plaice os this," and away he groped in search of a ladder. He was a long time feeling for it, and not until he struck a light did he find it. The light was in: a moment " doused," and again he groped his way back, half carrying, half dragging the "stee." Soon he had it out of the window, with the end of it resting on the yard below. "Now, thee keep cloat tu mi, else we'll 'blew   wunanuthir.'.said he, and out he went and down the ladder, I quicy following him. I closed the win. dow and got down beside him, after which we took the ladder away and laid it along lengthways by the wall. We then groped our way to the back door of the " drum," and in a few minutes Joe's tools were at work. All this time the rain was falling in streams, while, from where we stood, a perfect gutter emptied itself on to our necks and -heads, from the orerfilled spout at the edge of the roof. In about half an hour the lock and bolt was cut away, and the door flew open. In we' went, and closed the door after us on the latch. We had got then ioth one of the largest drygoods stores in the city, and when Joe lit his *'dar- key"I saw we were surrounded by pkes of valuable silks and velvets. He saw me staring at them, and tarning tome gaid, Ihsrply; "Wat'n t' yuce on yi stanin' the ir i' that waiy? Cam 'ere an' ow'd t' ' glim' fur a feller, an du summit fur than ' wack.'" ' I took hold of the " darkey"' and held it for Joe while he pried open a large desk, and there in the corner of it was the thing Joe was in search of-the cash box! "Ah! mi little lad," said he, talking to the box, "I hae th' noaw; thou sal niver 'collar' t' ow'd 'bloke's' 'sugar' agin. Bnu. let's see wat'n soart uv a 'swag' thou carrys," and in a twinkling he had his jimmy' into it, and it burst open. "Now, thee 'aud t' l;te down 'ere an' I'll kount t ' stuffr in mi 'cady.' " We both knelt, and I held the 'glim' while he run over the ' ugar.' There was exactly one hundred and four- teen pounds in bank notes and gold, and about eight pounds in silver, making one hundred and twenty two in all. , "Well,"' said Joe, "I doant s'poee it matters who on uz 'swags' this 'ere; thau maiy. 'ave it an' thau's a 1 myn tu, or I'll lug it wi' mi, iv thau sais so. Speak l t' ward?" I  had opened the door of the 'darkey' to give a bet- a ter VIght, it having been forgotten te refill it with oil, b and had just pricked the wick up, when a strong gust 1 of wind blew the back door suddenly open, and in a second we Were in darkness. "  O w'd on a minnit wyle I git a lite wi' this match,', it said Joe; and he tried to strike a light, but the tein- a pest of wind and rain that blew in the door prevented t him from lighting his match, and with a very tall oath g he groped his way to the door, while the goods in the y store were being blown about in all directions. At s last he fastened the door and returned, and having struck a  light, resumed his position, and was about ji conveying the "  sugar" to his "kick," when suddenly, f above the noise of the tempest, we heard close to the rn shop door the whirring noise of a watchman's rattle'! We both started to our feet, looking in alarm at each s, other. Another whir-r-r-r r.r, this time nearer, and tl Joe drew his "neddy" ready for the "slog."',  h "I'm blarsted iv wl aint both ' pinched ' Neow, it   n I thau'll 'ave to .fyght iv thau wants tu saiv thysev a m- 'laggin', Morst mi bloaly luckl I wish I'd agon ,k 'ome wi thee wen thau wanted mi.' e Another sound, and another, and still moro, and we of -stood petrified almost with terror. t  "Thunner mi bloady eyes eout, iv th' an't got all B, t' 'sakFcers i' t' town on uz! L' ty t' 'namase.' d Come on." d  Ihastily agreed,to this, and having 'douced' the r 'glim,' caught hold-of Joe's coat, and with him tried r to grope my way to the back "jigger." On the way nI was calculating the probable amount of punishment t I would have awarded me for entering in the dead of night burglariously into a peaceable citizen's store. Fifteen years transportation was the least I expected, and what was to bocome of Jacsie I Oldn't Lvaso o long without her, or perhaps ahe'd collar anoth(r "bloke" and think no more of me i The thought was maddening, and I exclaimed, ," To blazes with your bloody house-breaking, 'cracking,' or whatever you've a mind to call it; it's cooked my gooe at last. Where 3 now is all the '1ush drums,' 'dossing cribs,' and 'cigar 3 slums' we were going to open;?- But it serves me right; if I'd 'ave stuck to the 'dip' I would have been in " doss" to-night with my pretty Jessie instead of being lugged off to the station-house in this dripping wet state. Oh ! what wouldn't I give to be safe out of this affair! I did say before that I never again would help at such a Job, and here I am over head and cars in another, and already half " copped" and half " lag- ged," besides "blew ing" my rosy-cheeked blooming Jessie. "To blazes wi than Jessie ; am'nt I ' blewingt o' mi ' moll' as weil as thee?" said Joe, whoahad overheard my   talk. " Wi sal meeit 'em happen, wen wl cam back. But 'awd thau notyse i-histl"-and he opened the back door a little and thrust ut his head. I coul hear above the storm the sound of many rattles whir- ring through the streets and voices shouting. In about a minute, which seemed an hour, Joe took in his head, and shutting the door bursted out in a merry laugh: "Ha, ha, ha! thau bloody fooil! how scared than Fz. Wy, it's only a fire. Si thee, whip thaun rightened 'ead out o' t' daer an' than 'll 'eer t' ' coppers beefiu' and running tu t' fire." I did so, and plainly heard the cry of fire! fire I fire I and presently the fire en- gine rushed past. What a relief I I ain't ' lagged' yet, and there is every probability of again seeing my Scotchlassie. Hurrah! hurrah!" "  Now, then, this 'ree 'd t' best tyme tu  graft,' ' said Joe ; " ev'ry wan o' them 'ere ' cops' 'll be at t' fire an' wi kan du az wi loike i' t' drum 1' Cum this road an' let,^ loak fur sumit tu put t' ' atuff in." Back we went with "  darkey" in hand, feeling more secure than before, for we expected that nearly all the "cops" would be drawn towards the fire, and having found a large bale bag, we commenced filling it with velvets, vest patterns, silks, ribbons, gloves,   &c., untiluters was as much aseither of us could carry or the trunks hold. "'Ow '1 uz git 'em tu t' 'drum' wer t' ' molls, iz, 'thout wettin' on 'em i' this blarsted rain? I wish wi cd fynd summit takiver *emover wi- thee stan' w'er than iz and I'l taik a ' granny' round and loak for summit"With that Joe " collared the glimn and went in search ofa "' kiviring." He returned in a few minutes with a couple of macintoshes, one of which he put on, and the other he threw over the " stuff' when I got it on my back, fastening the sleeves under my chin. "Now, then, let's ' namse,' an' thee ' swag t' stuff* an, I'l stay 'long-side on ye, an' I'l knock blazes out o' ere a' cop' as 'll try tu ' pinch7 thee t"The " glim was douced," and we closed the door after us and groped our way to where we had laid the ladder. Soon he bhad it fixed against the window and we pre- pared to mount. "Thee ' namase' ahead o' me an' I'll follow t' after an' boost t' ' swag? up wi' mi read." - The load was as much as I could manage just then, for my clothes a1 stuck to my skin and prevented full action, and it was still raining in torrents. However, up I crawled, Joe helping by pushing from below with his " 'ead." We had got to about the middle of the ladder, one step at atime, and that slowly, when sud. denly there was a snap heard, and the nextinstant we were lying on our backs in the yard. The ladder had broke I Poor Joe was undermost with the " swag," and I on top of him, and the rain pouring on nu as if from buckets; yet there we lay, unable to rise for a few minutes, shaking with laughter. "G'er up, thau's a breakin' mi rbs wi thee an' that ere bundle," said Joe,; d we gohered ourselves up. "Well, that the-ir's a cursed skeer," said Joe. "Mi! I thowt my back wuz broke at t' fust-let's see wat we've ta du t' next." The ladder was picked up and e;SGhned; it had been broken before and was patched up for some light work, and no wonder it broke when the combined weight of Joe, myself and the " swag" bore upon the place wh,-3 j, had been " sore." "Wat's uz du neow, I wonder I But 'owd on a bit," said he, and off he went groping about the yard. Presently I heard a tremendous rush of water close by, and in a few seconds Joe had trundled the watst butt close to where I stood. "Does thau 'eer?" 1"We'r is't-a?"I answered. "Well, neow, IPe think we'll mannaige to du t, rite thing. Thee 'owd on o' while I git this blareted big banel on t' end, and then we'll put t' longest end o't ' stee' up, an' git eawt that way." Thi was done,wd after a little farther trouble-we   founda fOuelve8 again in the carpenter's shop. The barrel was sent adrift by a push from the broken lad. der, and the crippled " stee" was drawn inside. Here we fixed for the " namase," tying tightly over again the " swag" on my shoulder. All was ready and off we started, Joe close in my rear, with his "neddy" in hand ready to floor the first individual who should at- tempt to stop or molest ug. Fortunately for us, all, or nearly all the " cops" in this part of the town were at the fire, a very large one, near the docks, and we gained the yard in safety at the back of the hotel. We gave the "office,  to our " mo " by throwing a little gravel up at their window, and immediately the bag was lowered and filled, and repeated until the "swag" was hoisted into their room. We bid them good-bye, and informed them we would expect them- at the place appointed, after which Joe and I engaged a sailor to take us over inWhis boat as soon as daybreak dawned. There were some night houses open near the scene of the fire, and to them we hurried, taking our en. gaged boatman alongwith us, and there we spent the time " mixing," and mixing along with those who had been aroused by the cry of fire. The time came for us to be moving, and as the storm had spent itself the boatman cheerfully trimmed his sail, and we were soon on our way across to Barton in Lincolnshire. As soon as the shops were open Joe and I bought some clothes, for we sadiy needed a change and we didn't think it ,' cokum" to be seen mixng along with the "molls" upon their arrival for the sake of getting at our bags. These we took off were put in a carpet- bag we purchased, and now we awaited the arrival of our Judies. The hour at last came, and so did the ferry boat from Hull, with passengers for the train, and among'them we spied our darlings with a smile on their " mugs," denoting that a9 was "lovely." Joe and I had taken tickets for Doncaster for four of us, and when the crowd was coming from the boat we managed to slip each of our Judies their ticket, unseen by any one. The porter of the hotel soon had the trunks on the platform, and they were expressed along with us to Doncaster. In a few minutes we were seated in a close first-class carriage, where we could talk without drawing observation from the other passengers; the whistle blew and' off we were with our " sugar" and "swag" to Yorkshire. We hadn't "snoozed" with our pets for a few nights lately, and fully felt the truth of the words, " absence makes the heart grow fonder." At last we reached Doncastcr and hired a hack to take us to a public-house kept by the head "cop" of the town, called the "Quiet Woman," having as a  sign the picture of a woman with her head cut off.

' On the morning following, Joe and I took the trunks ;o the railway station, and sent them by express to he friend who lately had Joe's tools in keeping. Wb might have sent them straight from Hull to Leeds, but we were Earful of leaving a clue to the officers, whom we knew would. b put on -the ferret after the burglars; and for the purpose of spoiling the trail, ihould there be any, we took the Doncaster way to get to Leeds. We staid in Doncaster at the Quiet Woman's for three days, after which we :prepared for our journey to Leeds. On the morning of the 'third day, while the " mosls" were "ftogging" themselves for the travel, Joe and I were in the parlor taking a "wet" and filling our flasks" for use on the way, when I chanced to take up a Hall newspaper that was. lying on the table alongwith others. Ilooked al over it,for I expected to see something concerning the robbery in it, and there sure enough it was I "Daring Burglary 1"I read Rs more just then, but when the "bloke" of the " drum" had "stalled his mug," I folded it up and whipped it into my " kiek ;' then, "officing" my " pal," we both " namased" from the "crib." "Here, Joe," said I, as soon as we got outside, " let us take a stroll outside the town. I have just picked up a " huey?, and I think that job we've jast done is "chanted" it it. We'llsoon see it when we get a lit- tle farther on out of folks' sight." "Wat does it matter weir wi reed it?" replied he. "Can't uB goa in tu anuther ' lush dram' an' loak o'er it 'ithout runnin' a myle 'r tue away? Noabody 'll noa that thau's reedin' an thau ken ryve it up wen thau's throo wi' 't. Cam on in 'ere; t" molls' 'l wunder weir we've gon tu!"--and in we went to a snug little " lush drum," and calling for a "shant" apiece we sat down in the comrer of the empty tap- room and-there read: "Daring Burglary!  Fifty pounds reward for the apprehension of the burglars?" And below this heading: "On Tuesday night, or ear- ly on Wednesday morning, the shop of Mr. -- & Co., lnendrapers and general dealers, in ---  street, this city, was feloniously entered and money and goods to the value of five hundred pounds carried off. The above reward will be given on the conviction of the person or persons who  committed  the crime." Signed *'**.   "\z that aui?" inquired Joe. "That's all," I replied. "Weil, thai maiy aul go tu blazez, fur wat I kair about 'em an' the-ir fifty pounds reward! I'll gie 'om fifty pounds mysen an' the-irkan ' jug' uz fur this 'ere 'job!'

So ' sling' that ' huey' awaiy, an' let's Inamase, froo this town an' hav ev'rything dun wi' at wuncet." I made away with the paper, after Which we went to the Qaiet Woman, and finding the Judies ready for the road, hired a conveyance and were driven to the railway depot, where we booked and took our seats for Leeds. To prevent anything like:a " derry" being put on at our arrival in Leeds, we agreed to pair off and meet af Joe's father's in Somerset street, from whence after fixing the " moll" all square, Joe and I were to pro- ceed to the " fence" and make away with the " stuff." We got to Joe!s-house all safe, and after introducing the " molls" and making everything right there, Joe and I set outfor the " fence." The first place we went to was Lee's Court in York street, where Joe in- quired for a person of the name of Tom Kay. He was not at home, and from there we went to the Yorkshire Hussar public house, York street. There we were told that he had just left and probably we would find him in the Rising San, Marsh Lane, kept by a person named Kitchen, or Kitchenir. So to the Rising Sun we went, and there we found Tom Kay, brother to the notorious Matilda Kay, or as she was called Long Till Kay, the tallest street-walker in Eng, land, standing nearly G feet 2 inches high. We took Tom on one side, and made him acquainted with our busmnel, after which we three walked tow- ards the friend who had the "stiff' expressed to him. On the way we dropped in at the Boar's Head in Kirk. gate (Ned Langthorne's). It was market day, and all the "shakes" in the town were out on their " beat." Some of them were in the Boar's Head doing theih "max" when we went in, and among the numbel were Long Till Kay, Fanny Archer, Cranky Bet, and the two sisters Mag and Mary Anne Gallagher. Be. tween the latter two sat Squib Dixon, the cleverest "bloke buzzer" in Yorkshire, dremsed up in a country. man's suit-a brown billy-cock, red neck-" fogle,' drab-colored smock frock, reaching to his ankles, anc a pair of brown leather leggings, and in his " dako" a "cash" (stick), cut from a young ash tree. Tho "' bag" had been " coming off " with him, and he war flush of " sugar." Bat what we noticed more parti. cularly was the great attention he was paying to Mary Anne Galagher, the youngest of the two sisters. Some time previous he had "sweetened"Mag, the elder sister, so mueh so thatshe consented to " pal in'" with him, and they " dossed" together at Squib's granny's, up Marsh Lane; and the mother, Mrs. tallaghcr   "roadking  , bent this tmhe; they " fenced" the ole "Iumber" belonging to the "alnum "In Boot and Shoe Yard, and persuaded Mary Anme to lire along with them. Mery Anne was pretty good looking, and could, even at that age-sixteen--" kid" a " bloke" into a "a lum" and " pinch" him while " crackings about the "doss," and therefore didn't feel "sweet" on the position assigned her by Squib's granny-that of "dlavey" for the firm-so she "hnamased" from the "drum," and was on tie point of " palling in, with a Scotch " gun" that occasionally called in at the Boar' Head, when Squib heard of it, and he set about pre- venting it. He succeeded in keeping them from "palling in," but nothing could induoe her to retrn to Squib's granny's; so he hired a ".dossing" place for her and got her "lushy," and when she awoke in the morning Squib was -lying alongside of her. She "gammoned" not to know how she got there, and blamed Squib for taking the best of her while she was "maxy ;, but he made all things " square" by buying her a new bonnet and " spread," and so the affair was hushed for the time. It seemed that Squib had as great a liking for the younger sister as he had for the elder, if not more so, and he managed to "doss every alternate night with each of them, unknown to Mag. But he soon got played out at this game, and was forced to take his " doss " at his granny's-sick. While laid up here, Mary Anne took for a "pall" to "'graft', with her on the "pick-up," a pretty, dark. eyed girl, named Harriet Marshall, who eventually turned out to be one of the most daring thieves in England.  These two went out on the "pick-up , , without the aid of a " bludgeon," and " brought more bags offt" than any four of the old " maxy" smelling stagers on the circuit. Owing to Squib's sicness,  "sugar was beginning to Iun short at home; so Mag I thought she would take a run out and try to bring a "bag off." Bat her luck was out, and she got t "pinched" that very day by Jemmy   Childs, the  " opper," and was sent to Wakefield " star " for a  "moon."  While Mag was "doing" her "moon," I Mey Anne kept Squib in "  sugar," and when he got a up from his sick bed he openly "palled fa" and  "  domed' with Mary Anne. In a few days after this ' Ma^g got "  taned up," and upon arriving at Leeds i heard for the first time that her sister had supplanted a her in the affections (1) of her adorable Squib, andshe h vowed vengeance on both at the first opportanity.  So, to get herself in trim for the "slog,', she "maxed" e, along with every one she know, and before night she fi was again "nailed"' for being drunk, and "loughed n up" in her old " drum" in Park street, In the morning f she was fined for being drunk and disorderly, and not to having the "  sugar" to sling for the fine, she was in P danger of visiting her late quarters in Wakefleld. At t this stage of the drama she thought it would be the b bet "  cokum" to cave in, and send for Squib or her of sister to pay the fine for her. This was done, and Squib, under promise tfom her not to interfere be. cr twaen Mary Arne and him, brought her home, and she it   ole shared 8quibp "d doss"'- alngwithb her sister.-, This oe accounted for seeing him "pratted" between the ith brace of " blowers" in Ned Langthorne's. Id, We drank a glass of ale each and left the Boar's ) a Head, and made straightway to where the " stuff" was he in keeping. Upon exromining thelot, a price was fixed he and agreed on, but Tom Kay, who had been burying of a pile of "pinehesd' goods only the day before, hadn't he sufflcient , sugar" to "sling,' for the whole of it, and a we had therefore to sell as much as he had money to r'O pay for. Tom got his goods set apart ready for the re- " trap" that would come for them, and then we again m went to the Boar's Head. where we spent a few hours rn mong the "shakes" and "cross coves;" and when ce "Squib" got up to slither, we accompanied him in on the way. As we walked along he asked if there e  as anything in the wind that he could "stand,' for Ld he had " tumbled" that there was something on the is board, seeing Tom Kay along with us. We gave him ig description or what goods we had, and he agreed to Le take a " pipe" at them and "stand" for a portion, if Ls they suited him; but we would have to go with him e as far as the old granny's before he could get his "s lg  A." 00 Soon we trotted down the irkgate; over Thimble Bridge and away up Marsh Lane, until we dcanme to the vieqity of the Belby and Leeds Railway :. I Terminus. Here, up a narrow, dirty, puddly entry, we o followed the bold Squib, and away at the rear of the :. old wooden buildings, on the ground floor, was thel y hovel of Squib Dixon. The door waslying wide open a whenwe approached, and as we wentin Granny Dixon I* as in the act of "slinging, some "' posh"' to a band of young "s awney hunters,?" who had est completed the bargain, and were elamorang for the "regulars" to , be put round I On the table, half concealed, lay a r ham and about a dozen pieces of " sawney" that had just been "pinched" by this young  band of sneak thieves, and as granny was rather stiff in the joints to i move around, Squib was requested to " lar, " the s" awaeyg" and take it to the usual " plant"-' dark hole in a back corner of the "slum., There it waa stowed away among bunches of "sneaked" candles, Ibars of soap,halves and quarters of cheesec., &c. ITwas a  shocking dirty domicile for a ' equire' to live in.'"The floor was level with the street or yard out. side, and Aormed of the same material-muda! with here and there a pie-hole made by the junior I)LxonS, in which they mixed up a compound, and fired, in the shape of bullets, at the half penny ornaments over the fireplace, .&o They had,a little before we entered, been aiking a target of the old round faced Datch clock, for I noticed It had stopped, the hands being unable to pass a pile of flattened clay shots on the dial plate 1 Pigs and hens had a free and undisturbed right of en. trance, and well It was so, for they appeared tc be the only parties concerned in the removal of the Offensive accumulations of this stinking hovel. Among the curiosities of Granny Dixon's "fencing crib," we noticed a black hen, famous in its day foi its shopliftg propensity. It had been known to brinb   in to its mistress, Granny Dixon, over five shillings in one week from the half-shut tills of the chandlers' =hops in the neighborhood; and many apocket of tea was provided for old Granny by the sale of the differ ant articles of drygoods the hen brought home-sew- ing silks, ribbons, balls of thread, and every article 3[iss Hen was able to carry in her bill. But everything tas an end, and so it was with " chuckey ;" her game got played out. One day she had made a visit on the "sneak" to a small chandler's close by, the owner being engaged in a room on one side. of the shop. There was a half door which, upon being opened, struck a spring and caused a -bell to ring, thereby in- forming the shop-keeper that some one had entered; but that was no drawhack to Granny Dixons "sneak"' hen-she gave a jump, and ina whiff she stood noise- lessly on the top edge of the half door and "piped" the " drum off." All being " square," she flew over, on to the counter and " granniod" for the " slide," but that was no "bottle," it was "screwed;" so there was nothing for it but dry goods and to the window she flew where were exposed skeins of silk, papers of buttons, and hanks of sewing cotton and black thread. In a shortspace of time her bill was crammed with the lose parts of those articles, and she was on the instant of "namasing" with the " stuff" when she happened to cast her " ogle" on a bowl of peas. Alas! for ehuc- roy, this " kidded" her, and in a hop she was on the ige'of the bowl, and the next instant the bowl was piseee on the floor and the peas scattering about the IAop I The *" bloke" " namased" to the rescue, think- ing his "smash" was being "nailed" from  the d' slide," and there he beheld Granny Dixon's black hen, struggling to escape from the skeins of thread her feet were entangled in. lu a moment he seized the ohem-lknfe from the counter and sent it flying at the fowl seak, and the next saw chuokey " namasing" sad " beefing"Hke blazess towards the " drum" of old Granny Dixon. The blow \,tie the cheese-knife by cutttg off her leg, freed her rt m her entangled con- dition, and once more she was at liberty. Granny cried o'ver her dashing hen's mishap, but kept every- thing dark, and in a few days she had fieed a wooden leg on to ohackey with her own hands.  As soon as the stump got quite well the old feeling returned, and again Grannyg's pet hen essayed a foray. But poor chuekey I her glory had departed, and she was " bowled out" on every counter by the noise she made, tapping with her artificial scratchers, and after repeated attempts-all amounting to " shise"--she turned up" the " game" and retired on the superan- nuated list. Granny took a great delight in telling Joe and I about the tricek of the animals that crowded the "drum." Every ," grimlki"r was taught to " pinch" whatever he could manage to " namaNe" with ; but as he carried *n operatioen only among the nearest neigh- bors, his game produced more disturbance than the "stuff" he " neaked" was worth. Squib now made his appearance. He had 'ldung"   'lis " togs," and had on now a very respectable suit jf superfine black cloth. Going up to Granny, he whispered somethingin her ear, and immediately she drew from her breast a bag, out of which she took Oome " sugar" and " slung" t* Squi  The three of us now setofffor the " drum" where the " stuff"' was, and had got as far as the end of East Lane, Kirkgate, near to Boar's Head, when our attention was at- tracted tea " push" alittle way down the lane. While wondering what was the matter, a II moll" ran up to Squib with her eyes nearly tumbling out of their sockets, saying, "Oh, Squib, wy duzn't thau 'namase' down the-"i? Mary Anne and Mag are fightin' loike 'ell, an' they'll git the-ir b--y 'eads 'auled off'n 'em if thau duzn'tpart 'em!" Away ran Squib to separate his two " molls," who were fighting with a pair of " picking-up molls" about a " bloke" or " flat." One party accused the other of "crabbing" the night before, and then " picking up" said party and '" nailing" themselves without " sling- ing" the others the " regulars" they claimed. Squib was a long time away, and Joe and I got tired of wait- ing outside, So we went along to Ned Langthorne's, and there " pratted" ourselves, awaiting the Squire's re- turn. CHAPTER XXV.

After sitting for about two hours, and not see- ing Squib return, we concluded he cared -but little about buying any of what we had, and were about starting to leave the " lush drum" when in came Tom Kay and a party whom Joe or I -had never seen be fore. They sat down, and again the beer was brought in and eyery- one in the -place was asked to sup. In a short time Tom Kay " offlced," and we followed him oat, and the four of us crossed the street ard walked up the Fox passage towards Clash Hall, where Tom began business by introdueing this stranger and say- ing that he would buy all we had left. Not knowing anything of the man, Joe and t declined trading with him without some farther knowledge of him. This he seemed not inclined to give, and the trading was intrusted to Tom, who immediately accompanied us to the " drum" and bought every article left, and paid as for them; still they were sold at less than three-   fifths their value J "We found out afterwards that the "bloke" whom Tom brought to the Boar's Head to stand for the "stuff," was one who kept a country store in a village not many miles from Leeds. We spent about a week hunting up a likely place to open as " lush drum," and at last succeeded. In York street, about twelve or fifteenyards in from Kirk- gate, we found a party who was willing to sell out for the ready " sugar," and as we thought this a a very likely spot we soon concluded a bargain, and before a weelk was over we opened a "slum" under the sign of the Two Guns, represented on our shingle by two cannon placed crosswise. Our *' drum" took well at stasting, for we not only had the custom of those who formerly frequented the house, but also of those whom Joe and I knew personally. Among those who made the Two Guns their headquarters were two " sneak coves," named Yellow Jemmy and BIack Bill, Alias Wil- liam Garrett. - They had heretofore used Ned Lang- thorne's (the Boar's Head,) as their " meet;" but be- ing intimates'of Joe they transferred their company and custom to the Two Guns. Both were well-known to the "1 fly-cops" of the town, although Joe and Iwere unacquainted with this circumstance just then. The consequence was that our "drum" got "spotthd"- sooner than it would have been, had they stayed away from it, and we began to have frequent visits from the "cops" who dropped in to " granny" the " mugs" of our customers. These visits were the cause of scar- ing away a number of our best customers; so we put i our brains to work to remedy this, and finally we both concluded that it was best to "sweeten" the L "cops" by " slinging" an occasional "' douoer,' and purchase their absence from the *" drum."' The only detectives then in the town were Jemmy, Childs, Bob Hartley and Jack Stubbs. Bth Hartley being oonsidered easiest to make i" right," Joe and I "piped him off" one day, and when he had just gut out of sight of the police station, we " officed" him into a "Iush drum," where we concluded an understanding with him, and off we sailed in high hopes of soon mak- ing a " pile" by the return of those whom the " cop. pers" had scared away from our a' slum." One point of agreement between the " fly-cop" and us was, that no visits would be paid us unless actually obliged an his part, and when that became .neces- sary we were to be posted in advance, if possible. The next point was that he should use all the means in his  power to make their present haunts inconvenient for them, and so compel them to return to the Two Guns. I All this was carried out, and soon our " drum" bad an abundance of customers, but we needed all we got, t forwhat we took in in a pint went out in a paiL We a were continually pestered with " whispers" from the t t" cope," including Jemmy Childs and Jack Stubbs,  whom Boo Hartley (our first" oop'*) had been obliged f to let into the affair. This took away our profit, and i though we had the best rush of customers among the a "oross cribs," we found that we were going to the badi.  "I'll oa tu 'ell," said Joe to me one Sunday morn. u   t ing,' before breAkfast, ' iv tSbi,'ere wair ov wurlkin o 300its me. I wur grannyin, ' t" ' tin' wat we've got Y up t' stayers, an' maiy I be ' lagged' iv we've got wun aff o' wat we started wi'. rll tO1u thee wat it is' we o  mn loke about uz an' try to fynd a job! tu do, else n we'll goa tu t' cats dn sooeein." C- I was in hopes that it was not quite so bad, but upon r taking stock I was convinced that Joe was right as to y the amount of cash in possession. a    'Well, Joe," said I, upon learning how much we n were worth, "suppose I take the two mols' and o 3tart for Huddersfield on the 'dip?The fair begins t to-morrow, and I think we can 'pul away' a few D ' pokes' there while you remain at home and attend to the crib."' e   Tu 'll wi' t' b---y' dip.'

" Joe had noticed my unwillingnesw to join in with this, from his first starting to speak of it, and I was r, about to suggestthe impropriety ofjoining in any 'job" of the kind, with, such a character as Yellow Jemmy, rfor I had been 1" weighing him up" during the time he used the Two Guns, and felt that I would be loath to trust myself along with him in a "job"-from what I had noticod of him while " boozing" along with tho s who oame there, I put him down as one who couldln't "keep his guts"'-so I told Joe that I would speak witl Yellow Jemmy as soon as he came in. In thlo courlse of the day he dropped in, and after Joe had got through with him on the point of "turning up" his " pals" in the   " job"'-whioh he agreed to do-I had a long con- versation with him, and from what I there gathered, he had told no one of the exact locality where tho L burst" was to be "' done.;" so he said to mo, aftor I got through with Yellow Jemmy: "Well, wat's thau think on it noow? Thau'd bot- Uir be in it, an' it seems tu mi wi kan du it in a vorry , short tyme; 'tie neawt lyke wat we've dun afore; an happen' ther'll be a big' sta'k' tu be 'ad, but thau'll 'ave to keep a b-y bigeye on 'in wen 'o'8 at 'graft,' fur I'm noan so soor but wat e'll ' shave' uz lykeo 'cH iv 'e gits a chance; but by 'eavens I gin I ' collar, 'im owt o' 't soart, 'l batttr is 'oadin wi' my 'noldy,' I will, lad; so 't won't be gocd for 'im at that game wk u?! *   "Well, Joe," I replied;" gppositng this' jobcomes off'to rights,' andthat we make a big ' stake' by it, what do youintend doing after that? It seems to me that keeping 8 erosm coves' lash drum' isn't one of the most profitable ways bfrnaking our hard earned sugar, Wbfmg as a livng. Here we are paying taxes on this thing and that thing, and gas bills and rent, besides havig to' sling',all, if not more than our profits, to those harpies of coppers, who'll never leave as nor forsake us so long as there's a ' mug' to squeeze out of us. In fact, I've a good mind to 4 turn up' the concern and tako the country fairs and markets on the ' dip.' I thought at first we were going to make quite -a big thing of it by coming to Leeds and opening this ' lush drum l' But now look at our ' sugar,' it's almost a ' namaser,' and at this rate we'll be cleaned out in less than two monstS." "Well, then, that's just wat I say," he replied. "I know very wel that this 'ere's a loozin' game, an' that's ust 't reason wy I waunt thee tu cum on this I job ;' an' iv we git a big ' staik' wi, it, I'll tell thee wat we'M du. We'It start a ' dossin' crib' an' see 'ow that pays, an' iv that doant du, I doant knoaw wat's next to be dun"-and Joe scratched his head as if in a complete quandary over our future prospects. "However," he added, " let's see 'ow this thing'll turn eowt, and then we'll knoa th'after wat's best tu be dun.*a That night upon going to , doss" t told Jeefle how money matters stood between Joe and me, and like- wise what Joe purposed doing in the event of having to give up the " lush drum" business. - My graoious!" says she in astonishment, ' diz he waunt ye tae gae's hauves in keepin' a bawdie hoos I Oh, far onnw saik dinna hae onny thing tae dae wi, that. I'd suinnir dee than hae a han' in't. We can git alang brawly 'ithoot makkin' bruits o' oorsells, an' I for wun '1 suinnir gae hame tae mi mither, in Dundee, an stye whar ther's th' like carried on. Dinnae let him coax ye till't. Steeling's bad enough, but when't cums tae bawdie hooskeepin' let me gang * hame"--and the tears fell down her rosy cheeks at the thought. "Don't be alarmed, my Jessie,"' I replied; " sooner than degrade you by associating you with such, I would leave all the ' pals' and acquaintances of former years, and ' pad the hoof" with you alone, relying upon my own ability in the ' dipping' line to get a comfort- able living for both; so take no heed to what Joe says in regard to this affair. But IPve something else to say to you. Joe, myself and another are going to ' do' a place one night this week, and before we set out on business I will get him to share what money there Is between us, and I wili leave my share in your charge; then, should there happen anything wrong, it is my wish that you make direct to your mo. ther in Dundee, and there remain until I again see you." "Oh I for onny saik, leev off this hoosbreekin' biz. ness, an' let's gae 'wa tae sum ither place. I'm shair mi hert wuz i' mi mooth a' that nicht ye war oot at it   in Hull; besides, I dinnae muckle air aboatleevin, lng wi, Joe's wife. Sometimes she speaks an' aok like as if sho wUn na muckle worth, an' I'd raither be 'wa frae her than wi' her." , So you shall, my dear, so you shall; just as soon as this'job' is over, we'll leave this and make for London, and as your brother Wattie's time is up, I'll send for him, and then you'll have his company, at all events, while I'm at ' graft' with the ' mob;' for I may be absent from you for weeks at a time. So cheer up, andsoon we'll be on the way to London; but keep this to yourself." The following day Joe and I, in company with Yellow Jemmy, went out to recon- noitre the "drum." It was a large hatter's shop, situated near the top of the Kirkgate. At one side of it there was a yard or entry running through to the -meat market, or shambles; as they called it there, and in the entry there was a large win. dow belonging to the workshop of the concern, said window being composed of a large number of small diamond-shaped panes of glass, set in leaden frames This was immediately settled upon as the place of entrance; but how to reach the window was the nextaffair. Joe soon managed that. He recol. lected that a few streets off there was a house paint- er's where several ladders were kept. One of these he could get easily enough, as they were only pad- locked together, and a minnte's time would serve to get them apart by means of a picklock. But again, who was to carry this ladder along the street at that time of night. Not I, assuredly; that was one thing certain, and the affair was about being " barneyed" when Yellow Jemmy hinted that if we'd allow Black Bill to be in it, he would do that job as a part of his share in the "burst." Besides, he knew,notwithstand- ing Yellow Jemmy had told me to the contrary, that the "job" was going to be " done," and expected some of the proceeds as a salve for being put out of it, he being one of the original planners of it, along with his " pal," Yellow Jemmy. Joe and I consulted to- gether on this, and finally concluded to admit him as an accomplice, seeing that he had us in his power were we to do the "job" without him. Then, as in former cases, Joe and I went into Cox's (the name of the person who kept the store) and purchased a " tile," tendering a five-pound note, on purpose to see where the " sugar" was kept. Upon receiving our" finniff'; the "' bloke took jt to a desk, in the rear of the shop, and from there brought the "smash"' to us. Both Joe and I kept our " ogles" on the " bloke" while he was at the "' peter," and satised ourselves that it was worth trying for. From the store we went to the place where Joe said the ladders were kept, and there, sure enough, were tiers of ladders of all seisa; so far all looked well, and that evening we made up our, minds to " do" it on the: following night. On the following day we talked with Blaek-Bill, and he agreed to carry the ladder and remain on the outside, as his part of the programme, and so he was admitted at once into the "job."   As it grew towrards evening we told yellow Jemm, to i stall. hl mug" e-fto some other ' lush drum" and to meet Joe and me at the top of the Kitkate, at twelve o'clock that night, as, im Case of ae "rabth, it might be sworn that we were all seen together during -the night. As elevea o'clock Mtrm'k, the time for shutting up, we prep're' to loe, and in a few min uses all our customners had gone. I now shpped up to Jessie while Joe was getting his "tools" lected, and  bidding her be of good cheer took a s and returned I to Joe. I hapreviously reA her m\bare o   et 1 money waa between Jo andme. llbeingreadythe "glim" as " douced'- ad Joe and I took our ws,'yto  the top of Kirkgate.

' And her e we    e were, the three of u, tumbling and stumbli/g  over and against each other like drunke n people, and all in the dark, while the hata were going off like so many pop-guns under our feet.

We guessed the direction of the window and made towards it. Fortunately we were right, but an exclamation from Joe made me sensible of a new danger. "Wer In 'ell's t' ladder?" cried he. "It aint hnr ' Heres a b--y plant,' and we're soon 'lagged.' I donut cair a straw; we maiy's we'll chance it. Their's no ither waiy tu get eowt on it; I s'all jump it. Here, follow mi"--and with that he tore open the leaden window, and the next minute was in the yard below. , Curn on, 41bast thee eyes, wat's than hangin, behind fur!-quick! quick!" I threw myself out of the window, and hanging by Lhe sill, dropped safely beside my true " chum," who wouldn't leave until he found me safely beside him. I was not an instant too soon, for in the dim haze I could tistinguish .the forms of several persons advancing from the entry mouth. Joe and I did not lose a mo. Bent, but took to our heels jhust as we heard the fall. lng glass rattling from the window above, caused by tellow Jemmy endeavoring to make his escape. But he was too late, and ere we had cleared the yard lead- ing into the shambles, we heard the voices of those in  the entry calling the watchman to "Bring a light,  bring a light, here they are.' We didn't wait to hear more, but made tall tracks for home, which we quietly tntered by means of a night-key. The irst thing we done after getting inside our own " drum," was to 5 plant"'the ' tools" in a place made forthat purpose below the flooring. After which Joe mixed up a cobple of hot brandies, and we sat down to talk over t events of the night. At the time Joe and I opened the Two Gans there caTOe in occasionally a person named Shad Wade, a former acquaintance of Joe's and a -regular frequenter at Ned Langthorne's-(the  Boar's Head). The only means of Hliving he had was by his "moll," who went outat night on the " pick- up lay," he at times doing the" bludgeon" for her.; It was often observed that while other " picking up molls, and their " blokes" t got occasionally , run in," neither Shad nor his  " moll" t got" shown up," the reason why was not then known.  This hulking, lounging, pot-walloping vagabond, who lived on what his " moll" could bring in, without q ues f tioning the method by which she obtained it, (for all c "pickingup molls"-don't invariably get their " sugar'  v ,  the on thirfeet), had many opportunities of " ear. v wiggirg" what  was on th e board among those around n him ; and as soon as he had collected information d worth imparting, oad  he steered to Jemmy Childs, the w head detective of Leeds, ard made him acquainted w with what he had  heard. Thus it was  he obtained the w "Ietter of marque, for himself and heifer. It appeared, from what we afterwards heard, thatt Yellow Jemm y and Black Bill  had called in  at the t ' Boar's  Head, and while talking over the " graft" be;'  aery word of it, and at  ctlose cw arried  informa.' tion: to JJumpy Cbilds and Co. But with all his an-   'neeshe made one great mistake in his eagornaes' tWt '" nose" the affair. While relating to Jemmy Cht1 i what he had heard,%e set it down as the hour of tvtr ' o'clock in the morning when the " burst" waq to' bf, "done," and by this mistake delayed their arrA^r until we were on the point of leaving the " drum ;'"re- of course we would have left just as soon as we fonti the " soft" we were after, and which w .believed Yellow Jemmy to have whipped into his breta t. . The? had just got into the entry and were about arrangin: themselves for a grand "pinch,', when Bhck Wn "tumbled" to them and "cioficed" to us through htr key-hole. As it was, Joe and I barely escaped, ftr0, nelxt minute a watchman's - darkey" was shining tat blaze on the form of Yellow Jemmy, who was fry;te to wriggle himself free from the hole in the laticf window. Immediately another " skuffter" seized Ltts ladder and quickly mounting it,' eized Jeommy : b- the leg and held him until another managed to entc and the " ruffd" were put on, and Jemmy hoisted *'o. to Park street " quod." In the morning he wss ,' f4. lied," and tried soon after at the York Assez o, tw]ern he was found guilty and sentenced to tranEpor{:nn f*, fifteen years. CHAPTER XXVI.

In doing this I urged several reasons, but tt, only one that appeared to have any weight with hMm was that Yellow Jemmy might  "noseo" to the " baT who were his "pals" in the "' burst," on purpose i make his "lagging" easier, as I knew he was scow.

I knew well on starting that no "square" pan would have anything to do with it, so I had to Q3ok around for some one who was on the "cross" who Pelt like investing their "sugar" in a "lush ken." With this object in view I strolled into Ned Lang- o rne's "drum," and found that individual behind the Oar serving some "gonnoffa.." At first he looked thun- ering black at me, doubtless on account of our draw- "g away so much of his trade; but that I took no tqtioe of, and called for a "shant" for myself and the others that were there. This I repeated a couple of tWIes more, which had the effect of putting a smile on iNg '-mug," and he was on good terms with me. I a u n "officed" that I wanted to speak on the "quick" i li him, and he took me into the room behind his bar. , ia sitting down I told him to bringin a bottle of wine, E   had often found that a litle " lush ' would make Oem "spew" their hearts up. I filled our glasses and fQlded my business to him. The "bust" the previ- qs night and the "snapping" of Yellow Jemmy he F. well acquainted with, but I took good care that i should not know anything of Joe and I being e.- ]gaged in the "job.' I knew s trick worth two of that, 1Uieve me. So I merely said that we were tired of Oe "lash" business, and intended to "turn-it up" as "mon as we could find a customer who would stand at zast two "centuries" and a half for it. i 4' Heavy corpse me," said Ned, "you doant ask pough for it.- I should have thought a 'century' %w   oceans o' '.brass' for a 'cribt o' that kind, for !au knoas thysel all t' sticks in the houza ain't wnrth !Wty 'quid,' and I'z 'll warrant all thy beer and 4iquors aint wurth twenty more, and I suppose thau hlues the good will at two 'centuries,' eh? Doaut Tee wish thee may get it!" I and with that remrk he roared with laughter. I lt him have his fling out, and then said: W Well, you may think what you please about the l1oe, but all I can tell you is that I can get a ,'bloke' 4 five minutes who will stand two 'centuries' for it; k;;4t if we let him have it, yo'll quickl!y have to shut aslop, depend upon it." I wanted to get as much "sugar" for the " drum ' I could. This shot of mine had its effect, and after ;onsidering a few minutes, he said: "I think I knoas a 'bloke' who would like V' ave a ",nfh-orib,' but si thee, I doant think he has got 'owt' tsch 'brass' as thau asks, but if thou'lt stay here a sttle, I'll go and fetch him." i To this I assented, and off he started. While he vas absent I considered what I should do concerning 9e matter, for sooner than stay in the "drum" and ,k getting "copped," I would have taken a "score" oy, it. So I thought that if I asked the "bloke" a i'*iae less than I told Ned I wanted for it, I should not tighteffhim at once. He returned in a few minutes, *j;3ompanied by a  fresh-colored, flaxen "haired" ibloke" who had a flattened "boko," was about thirty aors old, and who, Ned said, was Jack 'Hallowell.   ! I handed him a chair and poured out some wine. After we had all taken our "shant," Ned remarked that we could settle eur business better without him, no doubt, and then left us to ourselves. Wishing to ' get the affair settled as quickly as possible, I inquired whether Ned had told him about the "drum," and D what we wanted for it. To this he answered that he * had done so, but it was scarcely of any use to go fur- ther in the matter, because he was not " up to" any- , thing like the "sugar"I asked for it; and another thing, if he had been so he thought the price was a ! stiff one for a "crib" like that, for he had known it since he was a "kid." "Well," I said," I don't care if you have known it ten times as long; all I can tell you is that we have taken over a 'finniff' a day since'we started it, and if yen know anything about tth 'lush' business, you can easily reckon up the profits on that.:' "O yes," he answered, " you might say you took a ' double finnifP a day, when perhaps. you didn't take in ten ' bobs,' and how amI to know the difference?" "Why," I replied, "I have seen your ' mug' in therl a few times, and you know as well at I do that nearly all the 'guns' have left Ned's 'crib' here, and patronize our' drum.'" "O that's right enough as far as it goes, but the thing is, will it continue so?" "Well, that's your lookout, or any other ' bloke' that gets the ' drum,'"I said; I' you are well known here, and ought to do better than me and Joe, who is more ' crabby' with half the customers that use the ' erib' than he ought to be." The wine beingaent by this time, I called Ned in to fetch another bottle, which he did,. and while plac- ing it on the table I noticed he " officed" to Jack to do something. I then asked him to take another glass for I had an engagement to see a " bloke" on business and must soon see about traveling. He swallowed his "logwood," and again retreated. Directly his back was turned, Jack said: "Now, I'll tell you what IIIll do about this ' drum.' I have got a hundred and seventy ' quid.' The seventy is here Cdapping his ' kiek'), and the oentury is in the 'jug,' and if you will take the ' dose' for the ' drum' I'iI buy it, but not another stiver can you get out of me for it; so say the word quickly if you mean busi- ness, or else I can't draw my ' sugar' from the ' jug' to-day."' Of that fact I was as well acquainted as he was; so after saying that Joe no doubt would kick up a row with me for taking such a price, I agreed to let him have it. Jack then started off to draw his " stuff'Y from the " jug," and it was not long before he was back again with a roll of" sugar" in his "duke." We then finished the bottle, and walked to the bar where, on "squaring up" with Ned, he said he hoped all was "cocum." To this I answered, "I did not know as yet,"' and off we went to the Two Guns. On reaching there I saw in an instant that Joe had not returned, by his "moll" being behind the bar. This I was glad of, for   x wanted to g"hi him the "ip" of wthat had oon red befire Introducing him to Jack, as I though he might iadiCstf boy "s mug " how pleased he wra at &he sto ceOI of my errand; had I told him before the purchaser the amount he had agreed to gie. Leaving Jack with a " hant" of " booze'? before him, slid a segar in his " gills, as I said, for a few minutes, I'. stalled" to the bar and asked Joe's ', Jadyt if she knew where he had gone to. "I think he has gone dolwn Brigate to see somee body, was her answer. But he promised notto be long. Why don't youwait? I'm Bure he will lm in die"t'y. ' That; however, didn't suit my purpose esxactly, for 'I wanted to ",oraek", to' him' befor* he entered the '" dram,  . Bo I walked hbstily it thd diidetidn that he had gone, with a  vrew to disob er his Where atouts. Fortastely for me I was not long i'sodoing, as on ppaeing the open 'jigger" of a "paddinig ken,' I  heard him talking to a 'bloke" liside; so I stetpped ' ia and called him out. In a, few  hrriea words I ac. i quainted him with whatI ha4 done, and on hearig the  sam thl t jack had agreed to ', sling" us, his" mug"  fairly'grimed withb delight.  "Thunder me blind, lad, wellt maik Suxlnit out t' a owld 'drum, yet. Come along and let's see t'-- f 'nmug' whose got t' sugar.' I  wunder it I knoas With that we hurried back and found Jack rather impatient for our return, and more so, I suspect, be. t  cause there was  not much basiness being done just l then. On Joe   , grannting" him, he shouted eut, i 1"Why  thou bee's t the broken  ' conked' b----s that i youst to gie my ' kiUy' tu i' Wakefield stur. I'll go tl tu 'ell if thou isn't. Dasn't than knoa me W  Ye On Jack replying that he did perfectly well, Joe b called to his  " moll" to bring in the brandy and some k hot water, and then the three of us eat down to settle matters  At first Joe (who was Bpokesman) depre w cated my authority for closing the bargain without his re consent, but at, length he wound up his harangue th by saying that I  always wai a I blarsted fNUil,' and he- do thought I  should never be anything else, and that he an   supposed he must stick to what I had done. I then h drew up an agreement assigning all that was in the sto ' erib " to Jack, excepting our "Judies" and "tog- or gery,"' aud be "posted the cole"' agreed upon, on the an table. That job behig concluded, we all went to the so bar, and some more "  guns" drolping in, we made the ka "Iash" flow fast and furiously. I instaled Jack be- wl hind the bar, and showed him wher e the v arious kinds to of liquors were kept, and then went up stair and told we Jessie what we had done. ThiM, pleiased her, and red throwing her srms  around me, said:     wh "  NKoo I'm satisfied; and et ye'll onny leev af ger hoosebreaking, and gang to some ither place wi' me, be t and leave Joe and his wife, me and Wattie can do weel con at the dip,' I'm sure.'             fol To this appeal I  &v2 wered that I did not kno as cla yet what I  should 'do until I had consulted with Joe; tra   Ted J but ome what would, I would never leave him in  ht shabby manner, as he had been a Sood and feaith t10 "pal" to me ever since we had been together, and ser thit would not be " rybuok" on mypart to " shaike" tck him off dishonorably, Jaaie acqniesced in this, and I gar went down agaif to see how things were progresxIng d" at'the bar. On reaching there I Saw Joe was getting ire " lushy,, and so was the new landlord, who evidently waan't accnstomed to drinking Such strong stnffas wn* e- had been in the habit of selling. On seeing me be be broke out into a   m"chant" of in l"At the charity school they did call me a full, Coo I'd got a soft place in my yed.', or  Well, thinks I, there is some truth in those lines, and e  that you'll find out before you are mapny weeks older, ho my boy; for I could see by his ogling and grinning at s. me that he imagined he had got the best of u, instead an of which we had stole a march on hini, and one of toe I tallest kind at that. I learned afterwards that Jack id 'had been induced by old Ned to buy us out, he paint- c- ing to ,him, in glowing colors what a ine I dxrum' it ie waM, andthat he could make a fortune there inless "than no time  if he took the  "drum." This was "cocum" on Ned's part, for he knew that just as soon t' as we left, the major portion of our customers would - follow suit, and return to his " crib.', a  1 called Joe aside and whispered to him to come out in the- street, on reaching whtih he " whacked" the r " ugar" that Jack had given him with me. I  then * told him that I meant going to the " start"' on the fol. t lowing day, and wanted to know whether he was go. i, ing too. t  Wy, than knoas I  will, but, si thee, I wad go wi' thee tu 'ell for getting t' pile of sugar from yon soft, 'eaded b- -r, who fancies we're noewt but a couple of a blarsted flats. Ha hal 'ow he'll cus hisel wen he 3 knoas what he's bourt." I joined in chorus with Joe's laughter, and then we went and joined the " molls." On telling them to get ready for the morning, as we were bound for London, they appeared highly delighted; Joe's "moll," no doubt, on going back to her old haunts and "pals,', and Jessie with the thought that she might get rid of her unwelcome companion. The next morning we all started in a carriage for the railway depot, neither Joe or I  stopping in the old " drum" to wish the fresh ten- ant good luck with his' venture; for there might be some " fly cops'" in there who would be anxious to know of our intended future movements, and that's just what we didn't want them to know. We had not long to wait for the " goaway," and before the sun had risen we were speeding rapidly to London. Nothing occur. red on the journey until we arrived at Wolverton, at which place ten minutes were allowed for the passen- gers to obtain refreshments. I had often stopped there before, and always found that the stated time was considerably curtailed, inasmuch that directly the folks had obtained what they had called and paid for, clang! clang! went the guard's bell, warning the travellers that the train was about to start, and those   I                   / who didn't want to be left behind bad to push to the I " aisges  without their tit-bite, and "' l1sh, or coffee, as the ceo might be. 1 I, however, was up to the "dodge" and acquainted my companions with it Joe swore terribly " that he wad ,av what 'e pade for or e'd go to ,ell," and the "mcdb" said the same. I told them to stick to that and they would do well. Directly the carriages stopped oat we all rushed for our " lush and grub" to the re- fieshment room, which is a most extensive and mag. ' ninent apartment, ornamented by gfgantio placards eonspiouously posted around the walls, "]Beware of pickpockets." On getting inside I " grabbed" a cou- pie of pies and a bottle of stout, which I immediately handed to Joe for the " molls." On turning round for some more, I " grannied" a fat old '"bloke" paying his account from a " dummy" that appeared to be full of "sugar." I thought I would have a try for it; so hastily swallowing a sandwich, I whispered Joe to take the women to their seats and then rejoin me, as I wanted him for a " stall. This he at once did, and in i a few seconds after the bell rung for the passengers to resume their seats. In the meantime I had " piped" my " mark" place his purse in his vest pocket, and as he toddled out I followed him, and Joe after me. On getting into the carriage we did the same and imme. diately the train started. So far everything was love. 1y, but the next thing was how to get at his " kick" for he must have measured six feet around the waist. I waited patiently for an opportunity, and at length one arrived. Old Falstaff fit begun to nod, and finally went fast asleep, and had we been by ourselves I could soon have " done the trick; but there were at least a dozen more " grannying" around. I waited until the train was within a few miles of London, when we en- tered a tunnel and were soon in total darkness. Now or never thought I, and leaning over I " reefed" up Lis "leather," which I instantly handed to Joe for him to " go through" it. This job he did in a bung- ling manner, for when he " slung" the empty " skin" (as he thought) out of the window I distinctly heard some loose silver strike the stonework of the tunnel. He had made sure of the " soft" though, and I was satisfied. When we emerged into open daylight there sat old jelly belly still in the arms of Morpheus, and he remained to until we arrived at our destination, and on getting out on the platform I told Joe to walk out. side the depot and I would look after the " molls." I soon got them into the street, and calling a cab, the four of us got in and told the driver to go to Fred. Hogg's " drum" in the London road. While on the journey there Joe turned out of his "kick" the "su- gar"' he had taken from the " dummy,', and on running over it we found it amounted to nearly thirty pounds. This paid our expenses from Leeds and left us a few "quid" each in the bargain. On reaohing Fred Hogg's "crlb," I paid and dis- missed the " cabby," and the four of us went inside. Il the bar-roon was the usual assemblage of " dips," "stalls,' d "garrotera." We were "hail fellow,   well met" with those that we -knew in less than no time, and after' getting our women inside of' ta'. sane.- turn anctorm, I called for a " shant of booze" for the whole company, and this was the means of bringing on another round of "lush" from a "sheeny wire" who went by the "chant" of Sammy the Jew-boy.

While we were swallowing  our " lush," he called me aside, and said that he was going to " turn up" his ' mob," for he knew well that they were a crowd of " beaters," and were in the habit of" weeding" the " pokes" when he slung them to them, and he wanted to know if we would take him into our " school." To this appeal I told him I thought; there were quite enough of us in it at present, but that I would speak to my " pal," and hear what he had to say about the arrangement. I accordingly called Joe and whispered to him what the 1" kid'" had told me, adding that I thought he was a lucky " wire," and gen- erally managed to " bring the bag off' whenever he tried. If he joined us we might be able to do without the molls going out to " graft" with us, and they, on- seqnently, would run no chance of getting " pinched.' "Wy, than sees," said Joe, " t' dip I doant at atn loike; but ef than thinks wi kan get a few ' quids' at et, until I ken light on a gude ' crack,' I doant ainud ' stalling' for a bit. But do as than is a mynd tV, for thau noahs more abeout t' "start' than I do." I then returned to the " kid," and told him the cnr. elusion we had arrived at, which appeared to pleaw him so mightily that he ealled out to Fred to repleiaua the glasses at his expense. On our ' drinking up," 1 told him that Joe had got his " tools" with him, and asked if he knew of a place where he could " plant" them, until he got a "' crib" of his own, as it was throw. ing a chance away to have them in his " peter." "Yes," he replied, " come along with me, and I w*i take you to a ' drum' where there are a dozen ' cract- men's playthings' kept ' rybuek,' and all the ' bloe' wants is a few ' hobs' for running the risk of the ' epl pers' turning the crib over." The three of, us then sallied out and made for the Waterloo-road, which was not over a quarter of a mile from Hogg's, and our new " pal" made straight for old Bob Chisnell' beer-shop, which was known at thai   time "s the Hit or Miss Old Bob (or Pat Bob, as the "guna" called him) was then deing a large business among the " crosemen" of that place, in various ways. In the first place, it was a meeting house for " gon- noff" of all kinds, from a ragged " tail-diver" up to a first class " swellmob" man. There they used to as. - semble to talk over " gonnofing," plan roebberies, "fence their swag," leave their " tools," &c. On go- ing in I could see he " gmnnied" me and Joe rather suspioiously; but on Sammy giving him the " offle', that we were all right, he touched a spring concealed under hid counter, and a door flew open which admit- ted us into the drinking-room. On entering, we were astonished to see the crowd of " guns" in there amns- ing themselves in various ways. Some were playiog at " broads," others at shove halfpenny, and quite a number were throwing hazards for a pile of silver. On seeing us we were warmly welcomed by those of the assemblage who knew us, and of course had to " lush" the whole party. Among the " blokes" there I noticed Teddy Grapes, Sammy Pollard, and Joe Tighen, all of them " dips." The " stalls" were represented by lkey Romne, Harry Witty, and Joe the "magsman;" white the "craeksmen" there consisted of Harry Scully, George Fawcett, Bermuda, Harry Stark, and Joe Winthrop. Then there was old Bill Dnn the "fence," and Ja- cob Lawrence the Jew, who was in the same line of business. Our chaperone, Sammy, made his way to the end of the room and spoke privately for a few minutes to Bill Tupper, the pot-man of the establish- ment, who immediately walked over to Joe and asked him if he wanted his tools taken care of. In his re- plying in the affirmative, he unlocked a closet-one of which was on each side of the chimney-and there were more " cracking" implements there than I had ever seen before at one time. Each owner's lot was kept separate, in a kind of pigeon-hole, with some sort of an hieroglyphic over the top of it, in chalk, put there by-the custodian, so as to distinguish one man's lot from another. There were " neddies," "jemmies," "glims," " centre bits," " betties," " screws," cut- lers and tapers in large numbers; and all the risk run in keeping them  by Bill was compensated by the owners of them giving him a few shillings whenever they a" cracked" a house and it came off right. After "planting"Joe's lot in its receptacle, and " screw- ing" the door, we had several more rounds of "' lash," and in course of time this began to have an effect upon the drinkersimaking some of them talkrather boisterous about their deeds, " molls" and " sugar." Joe at length began to feel restless, and remarked to me that it was time for us to go and rejoin the " molls," and I think- ing the same, told Sammy we were - going back to Fred'%, so if he wanted anything to say to us he had better go with us. This he agreed to, and bidding the "guns" good-day, we set out again for the London- road. On the way, the Jew " kid" proposed that we should have a "' run out" on the following day, if the weather was fine, as he knew a place where there was certasn to be a " big fresh," and we oould not fail in   I bagging" a few " skina there, unless ometig ex, traordinary happened to prevent us.- To this Joe and I agreed, and arranged to meet him on the following morning in the Strand and accompany him to the "working" place. We then separated, he going homeward, while Joe and I went to see our "judiee," who were somewhat anxious at our continued absence. However, we soon satisfied them by telling them what business we had been engaged in, and after a finaa "ahant of booze," we all went to a hotel and engaged a " doss" for the night. The next morning, at break- fast, we informed the " molls" what we were going to do, and told them that they could do what they pleas- ed with themselves during the day, but on no acoount to go on the " dip" if they saw ever such a chance of "pulling off a poke," and they both promised to obey our iaqu'nctlons The time having arrived when we wore to meet Sammy, Jqe and I started for the rendezvous. While on our way we had to pass old Bob's " crib," and Joe proposed that we should have a glass in there. as he wanted to see Bill Tapper about his tools. I assented, and we went in. At the bar were a few " guns," who were evidently a crowd that " earried the stick." I only knew one of them, and that was Jack Gardner. alias the Brewer. He had lately been engaged in u "burst," at ajeweller's, and was pretty flush of "sugar" just then. On "grannyng" me he asked as to drink, and whi'e we were imbibing, Joe went to see Bill about his " thingr." During his absence Jack asked me if I was going to " graft" along with Sammy, the Jew Boy, as he had heard that I was in company with him there the previous day, and I told him that I was going to see what he was made of. "Well, now," he said," I'd have you be careful, for he is a regular little swine, and it I don't mistake he has been the means of ' putting away' a lot of men to the 'cops.' Don't you think it strange that his ' stalls' are always getting ' run in' and he manages to get scot free." "Why, yes," I said, "I think it singular, but it might be their fault in getting " snapped.'" "O, no," he said, "I can't see that, for I know over ten who has been ' collared' away from his side and be has never been touched by the dogs." TWhis communication made me somewhat suspioions of my new "pal," and I told Joe as we walked along what the brewer had said. "Wy, t' blarsted leetle rat," said Joee, " ef I thowt that 'e wur a ' nose' and put t' blokes awa', I would punch 'is 'sheeny' snotter until i' war as flat as a  pankake." However, I said that I would pipe his manoouvres off, and if I saw anything " wrong" about him I would immediately "shake" him. Shortly afterwards we met the "kid," and he told us that he was going to work the Parthenon in Oxford street, and that we had better go in separately for fear there should be a " fly sop" there, and that he might " granny" oar " mugtl" and get down on us. To this we agreed, but I deter-   minerd6'keep an eye on hB movements, and see that he did not "'!give 'as away" 'to anybody, if I could help It. I therefore stuck close to him as he edged in through the crowd, and noticed that he pulled out his 'wipe'! and ed  it in a siigular manner. Directly aftewards he 'f officedr to s to close up to hAn, as he ws going to try his luck, but on our going towards him I saw Bobby the piPe makir (a celebrated detec- tive who was known t tthe -"guns"i ' by title,) right alongside. Holloa, thought I, the brewer was right after all ; and Clutching Joe by the arm I dragged him out into the street. On reaching there I told him what I had seen, and stated thatin my opinion it was a regular-Plant" on-Sammy's part to get us " pinch- ed," which excited hiin so that I thought he was going "cranky' on the spot. He immediately; launched out into the most terrible oaths and execrations on the young hater of pork, and 'swore that if he ever met him anywhere he would maie him so as his own mother would not be able to redognie him. I paci- fled him as well as I could, and told him not to think of the little scoundrel; and fully believe that if Ihad not called a cab, and forced him into it he would have returned to the building and dragged Sammy out Ti et amts. On our ride homeward we stopped the vehicle at a public house and went in to obtain some lunch. While there we "'piped " the landlord coming down Stairs with his cash " peter," and loek itup in a closet behind the bar. "Dost than see t' japanner?"* asked Joe of me. "Yes," I said,  , and I wonder if he has got much su gar ' in it?" /"I ken easily find that eont,'* said Joe, and with that he plled out a "4oublo finn"iff" to pay for oar refetshments. The boy who was tending bar handed it to the proprietor, and he immediately changed it; but while in the act of doing so I noticed that he took a  "fi niff " for Joe from among a large roll of notes. After getting his change we walked outside, and then Joe said; "  Why, thunner me blind I if that ' peter aint got ^at least three or four centries in 't, ang I'll goa to blazes if I doant have a try for 't. Wy, that kan be ' sneaked' as easy as can be by uz and one of t' ' molls, "-and with that he laid down a plan of action by which, according to his account, we were to gain possession of the "bloke's sugar." His mode of trans.- acting the business was thir: I was to hire a earriage and take Joe's " moll " in it, as if she was an invalid, and stop at the house during the dinner hour, for at that period we guessed that the landlord and his fanm ly would be engaged at their meal, and only the boy d would be in the bar. On reaching there I was to pro. g ceed to the parlor and call for some refreshments. t In the meanwhile Joe was to go there alone and have a a  drink at the bar, and see how the ground lay for tl getting at the closet; and if he thought it was ." ry. k buck" he would "  office " to me to do my part of the h business, which was, that shortly me and the " moll" f got inside, she was to "sham" a  tig  ft, nd I al   lot was to nng ror water and vinega to recover her. This dd we calculated would bring the boy to the room, and I in was to try and 'detain him long enough for Joe to hi "Bcrew' the cloetand carry ofthe "peter.9"After ly going there several times we came to the con- laslion that we would try the experimnt, and :s selected the end of the month for the attempt, 1. as I kneh there would be more eash in the thing ,) th^en thn at any other period, for the publc0ans gona torally pay their brewer and-ditillor on ibe' first and ;dg second of the month. Acoordiagly we went towork im and arranged things o well aieordlng to our pro- s gromme that Joe had the " peter' in his earpethag h- ile thaanten minutes after we entered the hoase. fg Diredt1y he had done the trick he " nammead' Wit his it booty, and I and the " moll" were not long in'tolio r ixn ni it, as I did not know but that from one minate Ir to' another the thing would. be found out 'throung n some person coming in for change. Accordingl we i-got into the carriage and ordered the coachman to k drive us to the London Bridge railway station, where d we got out and settled with him. I then watched himf e drive off; and taking the "moll" under my arm, I t  alked her to the hotel where we were staying. Oa reaching there I found Joe had preceded me, and he - then commened prying open the box. Its contents were not of the value we anticipated, as the owner t had evidently eashe a check the day previous for a hundred and fifty ponnds. This was aa valueless as waste paper to us, and we consigned it to the flames, along with a let more papers; but on eounting the "sugar" we foand out that we were richer by a little over a" centmry., The next- day I  aw the thing "chanted"Ia the "hney' as a daring robbery, and fifty ponnds rerard offered for our apprehension.

The offer of reward was accompanied with a vague description of our features and the style of our " tog- gery," and though'"I did not deei it of much impor- tance yet I  thought it would be throwing- a chance away to be needlessly exposing ourselves by visiting the "flish boozing kens" around. So we agreed to keep ourselves quiet for a short time until the affair had blown over. With this object in view, we removed. from the hotel where we had been staying sinee our arrival from L8eeds, atd engaged furafohed apartment   in the Qneen's-road, Dartoa, which at that period was populated by a number of small merchants, doctors, lawyers and the higher grade of clerks. on engagig the rooms, the landlady asked me for a reference, but as I informed her we had only Just arrived fom the country, it was entirely out of the question. This made her rather dabious about letting the place, for she re- marked that a tenant who had hired them once efoire without references, had robbed her of all the linen, glas and other portable articles, and no doubt, she added, would have carried off the bedsteads and tables, had they not been of too bulky a nature to be removed without her knowledge. This *' lay" is quite a common one in London, for there are hundreds of thieves wio do nothing else but rob furnamished rooms; but that was not our game. So I pulled. out my "dummy'" and flashing a handfall of " quids" before her eyes, said: "Now, do you think a man in my position in life would be guilty of robbing a woman 1i your condition , "La, no sir," she answered, "I was not alluding to a gentleman like you for a moment, but you know I must look after myself." With this axiom I entirely coincided, for I saw my bait had taken; I paid her a month's rent in advance; and to stop any inquisitiveness on her part or inquiries of her neighbors, I informed her that Joe and I were travellers for a commercial firm, and had frequently to be absent for a few days at a time; also that we were both married and had no families. This appeared to satisfy her, and we took possession of our new " drum. , For a  few days everything went as merry as a mar- riage bell-the " molls" attending to the culinary 'e. partment and their sewing, and Joe and I  amusing ournelved at playing ', Ibrat," or taking a walk around the neighborhood. While engaged thus we used often to drop into a snug old fashioned  ,' lush drum," called the Red Cow, fora " shantof booze" and a segar. This hostelrie had been at one time a fashionable suburban retreat, with spacious gardens attached to it, but the 0 bulding in the vicinity had increased with such rapid 0 strides that it was then surrounded with houses. It was  principally patronized by the tradesmen around, and i a few independent old gentlemen, who used to meet 1 there of evenings and indulige in a rubber of whist, and t sometimes we would take ahand in withthem. Among J the frequenters of the parlor I particularly remarked I a   fashionably dressed, good-looking young man, who t was spoken of by the other habitues s Mr. Howard. e He always appeared to be flash of "sugar," and ar sported a  single stone " spark" on his little finger that was never bought for less than a ".century." With all a this. however, he never appeared to be genuinely i cheerful, for whenever he smiled--which was seldom-- v I could instantly see it was a forced one. I pointed 1 this out to Joe, and he said: "1 dost think t' bloak es dun a moorder sum tyme in or other, for 'e allers loaks moist cussedly down i' t' a mouth but si thee weot a rouzing " spark" 'e weors on a 'i clau. I sud loike tu 'ave 't-woldust than!" To this I  replied that I should not have the elightest i   (objecUtn to bteouKt  *b1at Beo thJ .aUble inque . , Ition, but thouhit 4the chanc6 was rather slim of ever 9 such an event .kog place. t  * I doantknoa; that thur es moir unlolkely thengs than that i' thes wurld; but I meen to foind summut O ut about t' bloak, fur I Im soor thair es summut rong wi' him; mark mi wurds eof t isn't." I quite coincided iRth Joe, and we agreed to sound I some of the old fogise about him. Joe was already a great favorite with several of them on account of his peculiar mode of speech and droll manners, and they were always pleased when the funny Yorkshire man (as they called him) made his appearance in the room. The day after the above conversation took place, he found an opportanity of drawing out of the landlord of the house, While they were enjoying a sociable glass together, t4e whole of Mr. Howard's antecedents. His father, at'one time, had been a wealthy merchant, but through severe losses In business had become a bankrupt. This blow had Such an effect upon him that he fell sick, and shortly afterwards died, leaving a widow and two children, both grown up. One was the young man we had seen, and the other hie sister. Both of them were highly educated, and it was always considered, until the rain of their father, that they were destined to pass their lives in ease and luxury. They were quickly undeceived, however, on that point, for when the funeral expenses were paid, they had not a shilling left to call their own. At this juncture an old friend of their father's, and one who had lost some thousands by his failure, offered to provide for him and his sister by obtaining employment for both- Howard being engaged in his counting house, and she as compalion to a  young lady, a ward of his; and though neither of them relished the proffered situations, yet they knew they must either acoept them or starve, and they consequently accepted. This had taken place four years previously, bu2 Howrrd and his mother had only resided about half that time in the neighborhood of the Red Cow. Mine host, in describing the family, alluded to the head of it as a woman who auffered from ill health, and was scarcely ever seen out of doors. The daughter he seldom saw, as she only visited her mother at long intervals, " and Howard," he said to Joe, "you are acquainted with." On the latter re- marking about his gloomy appearance, he said he thought that was owing to the change in his circum- stances, although he has a moderately good salary, and evidently enjoys the confidence of his employer. Thinking he had pushed matters far enough without arousing the suspicions of the proprietor, Joe deemed it prudent to drop the subject, and so turned the con- versation into another channel until he concluded to leave. That night, while drinking our "shant," he told me what had passed between himself and the landlord, and how he was certain there was something wrong about him, and said: "Ef I doant foind 't out yet, I'll gef u leeve to punch mi blarsted 'ed i see cf I doant."i   I told him to tak is Moonry, and not get himself Into fa ter about it, and, I had not the lghtest doubt but that we should discover all we wanted to knew in due time. This satified him, and we agreed to paro our Inquiries on the morrow. The next day I sounded an old fogy who, as I had often notited, was of a very inquaiitive disposition, and he soon gave me to understand, in quite an oracular manner, that our man gambled on the quiet; for, "id he, " my son, who'is a medical student, and somewhat fat, as you would term it, has often seen him gambling in a ' hell' in Leicester Square, and playing for heavy stakes at that; and which," he added, sententiously, "he could not do on the salary he gets, I'm asure." "Hallo," thinks , "this old 'splorger' begins to suspeot, as we do, that there is a screw loose withhim, though he might have exaggerated the amounts that Howard was in the habit of' spielng,' for,:where his son saw him." However, I had gained all theinforma. tion I wanted, and then left the opm,,unicative "bloke" an dry as a arcked orange. On telling Joe what I had heard, we agreed upon a plan of action, which was this: At night one wouldgo to Leicester Square, and visit all the gambling houses them (the whole of which I was thoroughly acquainted with), and see if we could come across Mr. Howard. Should we chance to meet him, nothing would be easier than to get into conversation withhim,.and per. haps induce him to play for a few "quids" at chicken Whaard, or rouge et noir, for he was well acquainted with our "mugs' at the Red Cow. "4 Ef wi' ken onny do that," said Joe, "'ll bet than a 'finniaf his 'fawney' 's mine afore 'nother weak es hover hour 'eds." That same evening we sallied out for the square about nine o'clock, as there in scarcely any play going on before that hour, and, on reaching there, first of all visited Green% " crib." There we found a few " p1g- eons" and " ropers" lolling around the room, but play. ing had apparently not commenced. After exchang- ing a few words with those whom I was acquainted with, we left, and next bent our Ateps to Faulkner'e "drum," which was then alongside the Alhambra. On giving the pass-word to the porter at the door, we were admitted, and proceeded up stain. There was some play going on for small sums but i our man was not there. Wa waited over an hour, and he did not make his appearance; so we "cut" from there and went over to the Nick. This was the best patronized " crib" around the neighborhood, but why it bore that name I do not know, unless it had some Wtfernoe to Old Nick, from the place being caUed a "hell."  On entering the room we saw about fifty playern there, engaged in rouge et rioir, throwing hazards and vingtun. There they were, some seated and others standing around the green baisz tables, watching with eager eyes the turning up of the card or the number of spots on the difoe; and as they won or lost, they would smile or let out a tremendous oath. Among the players wete some men of good standing   rI aoIety-,Seveal sporting oharacters, professionsa gamblers "gonnoff" and two Petticoat-lane dealers in old clothes, of the name of Abraham. They cearcely missed a night there, and were called by some of the frequenters of the " crib" " the fixtures." Joe and I walked from one table to another, speaking to such as either of us knew; but the individual we were in quest off was non et. At length I and my " pal" thought we would take a hand in at hazard and risk a "' quid" or two on the game; but before we had been engaged ten minutes, Hkeeping my eye upon the en- trance door-saw Howard walk into the room. I "offioed" to Joe that playing was over with me, and then fose from my chair and walked to the table where our "mark" was looking on. I got on the opposite side to him, and "hem'd" as if clearing my throat. This caused him to look up, and directly he caught sight of me he flaushed crimson. I nodded and smiled, which appeared to relieve him of his embarrasment; for he came round to me and shook hands, saying, by way of apology, that he had come there to look for a friend of his, whom he wanted to see on very important business. Yes, thought I, your business here I know as well as you do ; so I said, "Well, I and my friend (pointing to JoeJ merely dropped in, curious to see what kind of a place this was, as we had heard so much about it; and we-were just goig to leave,- but as I saw you I thought what a coincidence it was that we should all happen to be in here at the same time I I wonder what the company of the Led Cow would say ifttiy onely knew we visited a gambling" hell.'? Again the forced smile came across his " mug," and he said something about he " didn't care what they thought, for his part." I then asked him to join us in a glass of wine, which at first he refuted, but on my pressing him he finally assented. I then beckoned to Joe who joined us, and shook hands with Howard, and the three of us went to a neighboring tavern, and I called for a bottle of wine. Whae finishing this, I noticed that he helped himself pretty, freely, which was just what I wanted, and the consequence was that the bottle was soon emptied. He then insisted upoa pay- ing for a second one, and when that was out, Joe who was "ehnamming lusby," rang the bell for a third. While we were drinking this the conversation turned upon gambling, and as the wine had unloosed his tongue Howard said he know all the games that were played Ih the Nick, and did not ask any oddf of any professional player who attended there. Joe, on hearing this boast, blurted out: "Ize ul tell thee wtt I'll da wPi theey Mister SWrd, I be no prufoahenal moen as than talks about, but I'iI throw thee a main at hazard for a pound or two. Wot aez thau?'" "I'll do it," replied Howard, "but we must return to the place we have Jamt ieft, where we can play without being disturbed by any one." I agreed to accompany them, asd- the three of ns again adjourned to the Nick. We ai eat down at a private table, I as a looker on and the other two play-   in . Howard was certainly drank and played reck- ) lessly, but he was fortunate enough in a shortsprace of time to win thirty " quids" from Joe. This succes ta elated him so much that he offered to play for a o heavier stake, and on my looking over at Joe, I could th read in his eye that fio meant" beating" him; soI hi "I offioed" to him to pile it on' thick and get through  with the affir. With thathe pulled out his "dmmy" he and offered to throw him a main for half a " century." ol This his opponent agreed to, and In loes time than it o takes to write this the 1" century" was on Joe's corner U of the table. Howard-appeared a little nonplused at St this; but thinking, no doubt, that he could win back w his lost" quids," he proposed throwing again for the e same stake, which soon followed the fate of his prede- a cessor. Poor fool I had he been as rich as CoeBsus he b would have " got broke" that night, because it was im- a possible for him to win once, unless Joe felt inclined to t let him do so, for he " secured" the "die" every time. w After playing a trifle over an hour, Howard arose from  the table, minus a hundred and eighty "quids" in . ahab, his " red thimble" and beautiful "spark fawney," z and Joe held acceptances from him for two " oentua-  ries" more. This loss sobered him, and he shooLlke i a " bloke" that was on the polt of being " topped."  His conqueror then proposed paying for a supper and a wines, but he would not listen to it. ]He wanted to 1 get home, he said, (and I've no doubt but he did.) So J he asked Joe to lend him a trifle of change to pay his cab faoB, saying he would return it when they next met. O0 hearing this my "' pal" took him aside and- spoke privately to him for some minutes. I then saw Bomething pass between them, and our victim returned to where I was standing, shook hands with me and bid as good night. When he had got out of eight, Joe in- dulged in an impromptu jig on the sidewalk, and for a moment I thought he was going "cranky," but he soon stopped, and turning to me, said: "Nos, then, wot 'id I tell thee than blarsted fiat  Dost see this? (showing me the " spark" on his fioger.) Didn't I tell thee I wud 'ave un tfor long, and that 'e is, t' leetle booty. We'st don gud to-night, lad. Perish me blind I ef us 'avent. Wy, wi 'al ' whack' nerely tu 6 centuries and a 'arft at lest. Cum in 'ere," said he, pulling me into a " booze crib," " and ave a ' shant o' lush,' and I'ale tel thee wot I did wi'- yon' bloke' that a jest left us." While drinking he laid: "Dost see wen t' fiat axed mi for t' change, I thowt ef I was to offer 'em a few quids' -to run on w, I soud 'ave 'em completely under mi thomb, for wat I want 'em for, byr bie, of 7' t ?aem- At rlat 'e wouldn't, but arter all I mad 'em tak' a score, for Which b' eade 'e wor deeply grateftl tu me. Dot 'ear        ,  ,  *    I tSt ltiiak 'em dfistly tful fote I'zedon w em. , We then finished our " lush" and called a cab to take us home. While on thie uwraey we had a long conversation together, the upshot of which wat ths, that Joe should wait a few days, and then ak him to take up his I. O. U.'s, for he wanted the money very urgently. We calculated, and rightly, too, that he was plundering his employer in some way, but only of small sums at a time, and that to aak him for the cash at once to liquidate his gambling debts would be more than he could possibly " pinch"Immediately. Should'he not be able to redeem his acceptances, Joe was to assume the austere and threaten to go to his employer ind expose him to that gentleman, not only as a habitual gambler, but hint at something like em- bezzlement orfelony on his part. This mode of pro. ceeding we thought would make him offer any terms to avoid the threatened " showing up," and if so Joe was to ask him to " put up" the warehouse where he was employed and he would do the "job," at the same time giving him to understand that if the affddr came off " rybuck," and anything like a " stake" wu got out of it, he should have his " regulars" the same as those who were engaged in the business. This was Joe's proposition, but 1 told him he talked as though I everything in the matter was already cut an dxried D for us. In th3 first place when spoken to on the sub- D jeOt he might agree to acquiesce with the proposition a to gain time, and then go to his employer and oontfes t all. Perhaps--s you know from the landloid of the - Bed Cow--through him being on such intimste terim w with his father, he might forgive him and have us d " copped" for trying to induce him to commit a felony, d or then again he might " namase" and leave yon to L- whistle for your two " centuries." Or again be mVght-- "' Tu blsaes wi' your agins," roared Joe, Interrupt- e ing me; "I'ae tel yu wot 'e es tu d-d fritened tu tri and git out o' mi clutohis I knoao. Just thou wate a ? few dais and see ef I doant mak 'em doo ja wot I ) wants 'em, or thou sl sai I'm t' bloodyeot fale under 'e t' sun; 'e sal ' put up' yon ' crib'. Now I've made d. st." '  I let him have his own way and said no more, for I in knew he would " jaw" for a week if I answered back, ad and shortly afterwards we reached our "drum.' On ri'- getting inside we found the " molls" had retired for he the night, so Joe laid he might as well "put the eu- , I gar about" then as in the morning, and as I did not Dn disagree with the proposition we proceeded to divide for the poils.

We allowed a week to pass over, duaring which time We saw Howard frequently at the Red Cow during the evenings, but he never mentioned a word about hi indebtedness to Joe. At length the latter thoughtit  was high time to put into operation the programme  tlathe had previously suggested, and eonsequently I Spoke to hini o the subject. Joe at first feand co  dermble difficulty in getting him to "put up , the 1 "ei!t " but on threatening him with exposure to his .a employer he finally consented. I was theninatroduoed in the cosultation, and from Howard learned that h there was a large stock of valuable silks and sat in  e the store, and also a considerable amount of aso k a in the safe, but the key of it was never out of w the possession of the head of the firm, o there di was no chance of our taklna  Laen  prion of ItL We, however, determined to blow the safe open fe t he could not get at its contets by any other means, e and in view of the * swag" that we intended to carry  of, we decided that there must be another hand to ni help us in our enterprise; but who to get was a puzzle, at for an, as we wanted no one but a thorough ," craks. fo man," and a " ryback bloke", at that. However, wen a settled the matter by goingto the Hit or Miss forJoe's EBB tools." While Bill Tupper was returning them to an him, I  sounded him to see if he knew of any one like  what we wanted. "Why, yes ;" he replied. "I know plenty of' blokes' the that would jut fit you, but the thing is that they all tw have jobs in hand, and perhaps would not like to leavr0 wa them to Join you in your afflir.. But,', he added, he, "there is Jack Gardner, who ha lately been "doing, athe jeweler's shop in the strand, if you could only induce and him to join you, he is just the man you want, for he wi knows his 'graft' as well as any one in the 'start. Any. but how, you can go to his house and speak to him "pC about it, and no doubt but that he will give you a atte lift -withthe job. I'll go along with you, and show hid you where he lives."             for , Accordingly wa e  all started for Pearl Row, where I ki the renowned brewer " hung out." This street at that cibi period wase populated with ', guns" ibf all classes, and asif "shakes." In it was a " booze crib," called the Red spoh Lion, which was the resort of all the notorious  , gon reli. noffi', belonging to the Surrey side of the river. We A do had to pass this house to reach Jack's domicile, and as to be we reached the door, we met Teddy Grapes, the {hinE "w ire," coming out. He had evidently been pulling i nine   tep " bag of,, forhe was three parts "ttight, so he , ae    Afd Insisted that we should go in and have "shalnty " of "r booei along with him.

We TO did not care about tying in the room, which was filled e with - tobacco smoke; so we called for our " lush., Ta When Tupper had drank his, I told him to go in and r ON tell Jack that we wanted to speak to him, and he ac. eordingly did so. On his return with Jack, I called for ime another roand of " boost," and then took him aside the and explained to him what wep were in search of' his While talking to him it was evident to me that he did t it - not are aboutjoining us, and, on my asking him the me reason, he said that, in his opinion, the whole arrange- tly ment was a " plant" on the part oftho " flat" who had D- "puat iti up,' and advised us to have nothing to do with the it. When he had concluded, I called Joe and told him is what Jack had said, but he only smiled, and said: ed  "I'll plant 'em, ef onny see anything o' t' kind, at rwi' may 'neddy,' I'se '1 warrant thau.

The A same evening we had a -conversation with Howard, D and from him learned that there was over *ie thou. sahd pounds in the safe, for he had seen the cashier count the money and hand it over tothe principal of - the firm, and from what he heard in eonversation be- tween them while the money was being deposited, it ' was likely to remain for a couple of days. Jo', on hearing this, determined to have a try for the prize on the following evening, so we went again to Pear I Bow and notited Jack of our intentions. He was Pome. what surprised at the suddenness of our movements; but on our telling him of to big stake that was in the "peter,', he coincided with as that the job should be attempted as soon as possible. We arranged to meet hi at ten o'clook that night, and then we went to look for a  cabman who would carry off the " swag" for us. I   knew a " bloke" named Squires that owned some cabs, and had no doubt if he was well paid he would Waimt us; so we went to where he lived, and spoke to him about it. At first he did not appear to relish the undertaking, but on my offering him E ' double finiffrm if the "job" came off righthe agreed to be on hand at the appointed hour. We had now every. I thing arranged for the night's work, and at half psie nide, we started on our mission, taking Howari. elona   with u, in asue that be might have 'nosed" on our in- tended opecatiOns. He, however, had to forti 'hil courage by drinking plenty of brandy, and by the time we met Jack, he was nearly " lushy,' We then made for the warehouse, which was situated in King street, Cheapside, Joe and Jack taking the lead and Howard and I in the rear of them. On approaching the " crib" we saw a " copper" trying the doors of all the houses in the Street, so We let him get through with his business and out of sight before we attempted to " screw" the place.- When the coast was clear Joe "nipped" ap to the door and " threw it off" im- mediately. He then went inside and Jack followed him. I and Howard in the meanwhile were " piping " up and down the street to see that no one was " fox- ing" sn, and seeing nzo one around fe walked to the door, and gave the " office ' to Joe, who immediately let ua in, and then fastened the door inside. We were now fairly in the- dram," and Joe lighted his "glim" I and took a survey of the premises. On all sides, from 4 the ceiling to the floor, were shelves loaded with t costly goods, which the " putter up*" said was worth some thousands of pounds. He pointed out which i was the most valuable, and while he and I were so:  lecting the parcels and conveying them to the door, so a as to be convenient to' the cab, Joe and Jack were en deavoring to "screw " the safe, but it resisted all their t effort, and at length  Jack proposed blowing it t open. Joe assented and the powder was placed in the r keyhole. The train was laid, but before it was fired, I h4 had to go and look up our Cabman,and also see that the f "copper" was not   around. Our " swagman"  I  found at his post, and telling him where to go, t let h him and watched th  " copper" for some distance, o away from the warehouse. Then I ran up to it, and it "officed" to Joe that everything was "rybuak.", I had scarcely got the words out of my mouth before an ex- A plosion took place, whioh shook the whole of the sc buildings in the street, and broke the glass of the lamps. Ia an instant I saw that it had alarmed the neighbor. ge hood, tor there were night-capped heads protruding m from several windows. Or oabmanu was aso soared Itr that he whipped up his rosinante and made tracks su ins qaiok as he could. On Joe opening the door to admit ed me, I found the place fall of smoke, and Jack and for iHoward both wounded by some fragments of the safe m door, which was completely shattered by the explosion. for Howard  was  bleeding profusely from a cut in u the head, and had fainted away while Jack had ne. two of his finsers dangling to a portion of the akin. pi Joe, on, seemg me aV. right, roared out:    no "Peaish  me blind I re's a go; wy t' bloody fale wo pat enow powder in yon hole to blow t' bloody house ev down.

Betore we 'his had considered how to get away from the " ribe' there the was a thundering tthe front door, and we heard the hen springiug of a polioeman's rattle.

On taking a good " swig " at that g " he told us that there was a " get-awnay" from the DX- "crib" by a court that ran along the bask of the build- he ing, and in that direction we all made a move. There sly was no time to be lost, as we could hear the voices of ,re number of people at the front entrance. So I trap- n" pod my hadkerchief around the box and led the way. ,m On opening the back door, a " copper'" who wa sta. th tioned there made a rush at me, lub in hand, to put a th "o pacherl, on, but I darted aside, and Joe dealt him a oh hot one on the osfrontis with a" neddy,, which rknook I. edwhim out of iime. Lnuckily for u he was by himself so so we took to our heels, and finally escaped into the "- Poultry. On reaching there, I hailed a cab and told ir the driver to take me to Pearl Bow, [iav#ng the other it three to follow nme which way they pleased. On ar he riving there I went to the Red Lion, and got the land. I lord to allow me the upe of a private room, and oalling he for a  " shant of lush," I waited until the others arrived, I which they did about an hour after me. Directly they It had sat down I  fastened the door and took the box out a, of the handkerchief, but no sooner had Howard seen Id it than he said, in an excited manner: d  "Why, thatis not the cash-box you have got there. All that it contains are the policies of insurance, and  some receipts and postage stamps."  i  T 'ell it is," roared Joe. " Wate till I see wet 's8 got init," and with that he burst it open with his ', jem. my."  Sure enough, what the "putter up- said was I i true, for there was only a few stamps and polioles of :E insurance in it. On Joe beholding our booty, he roar- Ied and swore like a madman, and if it had not been i for me restraining him, he would have inflicted srm- , mary vengeance on the "  brewer," whom he blamed' for all that had occurred, in putting in an over dose of gunpowder in the key-hole, and thus alarming the neighborhood. As for Howard, he looked the perfect picture of despair-from the knowledge that we had not obtained anything, as well as from the pain of his wound and the effects of the " lush" combined. How. ever, it was no use crying over spilt milk, and we se- parated for our respective residences-Joe and I pro. mising to meet Howard that night and consult over another plan by which we could make a big " stake." On reaching our "drum" we found our "  jdies'" alarmed at our absence, for we had not told them any- thing about our intended "job," thinking to surprise them with a   pile of " soft ;" but as the affair turned   oat " mrabs for us, we " stalled" their rien  off by saying that we had been epgged in a little business unexpectedly, whio had detained us longer than we thought it would. Joe growled like a bear with a sore head, about what we had missed, saying it was his lack to be cussed with a lot of clowns whenever he had  f fortune in his flogera I thought he included myself in this categery, and told him so; but he soon undecived me on that point by remarking: "Than wasn't t' blame, for I end 'ave deone t same as than did, and had it not bin for t' bloody fule oramain t' powder in t' hole, we and now be fingering five thousand 'quids,' instead of which we got' shise.' But there, 'tis mi bloody lack I I'se 'il never get enou' to leave off ' gunning' so long as I livel" I let him talk in that strain until he got tired ef the subject and then spoke to him about Howard. This , individual, so he told us, was in the habit of conveying large amounts to the bank to meet checks, and on the route there he had to pass through at thoroughfare which was quite unfrequented by foot passengers, and that nothing woufd be easier than fqr us to lay for him and give him a "domino" with a "noddy," and" collar" the note aaee he carried and its con- tents.

At first I saw that he regretted ever speaking about it, for when I asked him about the details he faltered and ed he was afraid that Joe would t6rioudly fiJare him With his " neddy,' and likewise that the head of the rm might suspect something if he was knocked down and robbed so soon after the burglary had taken place. That evinced an evident backing out on his part; so I told him that I would confer with Joe, and let him know the result On telling my "'pal" of Howard's indecision, he burst out in a torrent of rage and said: 1 Heavy corpse mi t dust than&u think t' bloody ' fiat' e gin' t' get t* best of me t Noa, I'll be ' lagged* ef ge dos; wate till I e  t' white Uvered rasoal--'ll mak em alter ' tone, or ITll go to 'ell, see if I s I told him notto he rash, and went and saw Row   ard agin that night While In conversation with him, I told him that Joe was highly. ncensed at hi prevari- eating, and meant, i he did not aot up to what he pro- mised, to go and tell his employer everything about him, even to the burglary; " for," said I, "he does not care about being trasmported, so 1ong as he has some one to bear him company-that you may rely upon." On hearing this he was somewhat staggered, and said that he would let us know when he had a heavy stake to take to the bank, Bs that we could " lay" for him. This satkified me and also Joe, when I told him, and we waited Anxiously for the time when the affair was to come off, as we were getting short of " sugar ;" but eventually our plans were all knocked in the head by our "gift," as we reckoned him, "namasing" ,away with the note case, instead of allowing us to re* lieve him of it. The affair cauped some excitement in London, and was the means of getting him arrested In Guernsey, with the bulk of the cash. On his being conveyed baok to the " start," ha " opened" to the "coppers" everything concerning his arrangements with us, and told all about the way we had got at him. The first intimation we had of- this was from the "molls," who told us when we went home to dinner I that two strange men had been inquiring for us, and wanted to see Joe partioularly. On asking the de- scription of them, I recognized one of the two as Brett, a city " fly cop," and of course I could guess who was his " pa' I told this to Joe, and said that the beat thing we oould do waa to leave the " arib" and go somew'ere else, for we were-sire to be " gpia6h- ed" if .we stayed there much longer. "Now," said I, "this ' fitty swine' has ' nosed' on as sure as you live, and the best thing we os. do is to leave this. ' drum' as soon a possible, or we shall be in the 'booby hatch' before we have our supper." Joe, on my finishing, said: "L Dust than sa t' bloody dog 'as ' rounded' on us? Ef I thowt so, wy av ooree I'd leve t' I crib' in a minnit, for I doient want to be ' lagged' yet, ef I knoas 't*" This decided the point,Sand so we packed up our , traps" asspeedily as possible. When that job was completed, I called the landlady and told her that we were about returning to the country, as our employers had sent for as, and ahould any gentlemen 0o4 after we had left, to tell them we had gone to 'Manchester. This she promised faithfally to do; so we got a cab and ordered the driver to take us and our luggage to Boston Square. On arriving there I paid and dismisn ed him, and then called another one and told him to take us to Newlgton Causeway, on reaching which I stopped at old Bill Donn's coffee shop. Leaving Joe and the " molls" in the vehicle, I walked in and made my way to the sanctum sancor um, where: I met Ba's old women in a state of beer. On qaestioning her abopt her oara posc, she answered in a lachrymose tone that he was out on " bunianes," and she did not know what time he would return. On hearlig that, I inquired if she could accommodate me and my friend * .   with a couple of beds for the eight, as we wanted to stop there.       .. "Yes," she aid, " but I want to see what heifers you've got along with you, for my * drum' aint s ' knocking' shop." This speech somewhat surprised me, but knowing that she was drunk, I paused it off as a joke, and told her that the women who were along' with us were our Wtiea. "All right, then," said she, " bring them In and I'll take i stock' of them." Thise, I thought, was pretty saucy; but as I was in a fix I concluded to take no notice of It and went out to the eab and brought Joe and the "ladies' into the ' drum.' On seeing him, he said: ' Come in and take some ' max' along with me, for I haven't seen you for a month of Sandays.* On hearing this speech Joe muttered something that was rather derogatory to Irs. Dann's character, but his "moU" didn't seem to half like it and " beefed" out: "Whit do you know about my old man?" "Why," retorted Bill's old woman, "he was my fanoy-man years before ever you saw him t' "That'8as thunnering lie" said Joe, "I'se newer sen aufa en all mi loife, an' than knoas 't too; so wat does tha  want to sa that far. I koas Bil from fencin aun  'tuff t' ema; and thats all I wall t' knoa, Mre. Dann," Thikting t ho matter wonld get warm, I Interffrde, and-remarked that no doubt it was a Joke on Mrs. Dean's part, and as she eoincided with me and said Chat It was all devllment on her side, for she felt funny, the whole of as treated the affair as a jocular arrange- ment, and retired to our respective " dosses." Ih the  morning I had a conversation with our "molls," and told them how we were fixed, and that g   best thing they could do was to take a "run out" and see if they were Inucky enough to " puil a bag'" or two off; for our funds were nearly run out, and it would be throwing a chance away for me and Joe to venture out to "graft" while the " pigs" were on the lookout for us, They agreed to try their luck at "' stage buzziag', for a few hours aan it they did not " pill" anythig off t that" day," to pay a visit to the Horticultural Gar- dens at Cheswlck, as it was a fete day there, and the weather being fine, no doubt but there would be a tremendous " push" on the occasion. Thij being arranged between them they harnessaed themselves and started on their expedition. ' For some time after their departure, Joe and I sat smoking and drinking, each of us busied with our own thoughts; but at ltefgt he juamped up and said- "  T 'etl wi' thes game; ot giva mi t blues t b, sit. tin' roie Iolko  bloody dumjy.

Bo .the pair of as sallied out and went to I the "guns" headquarters of the Surreyside of the r river. On going into the skittle-alley we found a lot of "guna"Playing there for "quids."  Conspicuous I amng them was Keeny Malone, a Liverpool "1 buner" and " bludgeoner," whom Joe knew, and soon the two of them got thick together. Of course nothing else ) would do but what we must have some " lush" and a talk Of how things were going on with ns. Keeny told a long rigmarole story about his " moll" " nailing", an old " bloke" the night previous of sixty quids" and a red " thimble,'" and that he had merely dropped into the King's Read for a " shant of lush" while on his way to Bill Dana's " crib" with the " super to fence." While we were talking at the bar the outer door was opened, and in walked Brett and Mike Haydon, two of the smartest " coppers" around. Fortunately for Joe he had his back to the door, eo they could not " gran- ny?" his " mug ;" and I Immediately " offioed" to him what was up so as to keep his " chump" still, and they passed by and went in the direotion of the ektttle ground. Directly they had got out of earshot I hur- riedly told him who they were, and no doubt they were looking for him about Howarc'^ arrangement. Si tWh waivm thing for him to do wre to *' namea7r instantly and make for London B;idge, where I would join him as soon as possible, and then go somewhere for a trip. He did not want telling twice, but ran to the door, hailed a passing 'bus, and was on his route' to the city before the "coppers" had returned to the bar. They did not take any notice of us, and as soon as they had left the house I wished Keeny god-day and hurried after Joe. On arrivirg at the meeting place, I found him anxiously waiting to hear how the affzir had terminated, and on my telling him the sequel of it he burst out laughing, and said: "Wi, we wor ta bloody fules arter all; bat si thee  now wi ar 'ere let's go sumewhere for t' day, for Hee sick o' yon ' crib' and ' boozing.' " I feo somewM   mW^i andi proposedan that we ashould go to Greenwioh and visit the hospital there, as it was a " rybuck" place for " grafting," and no doubt we could get a " poke" or two, or at least clear our ex. penaes. Joe assented, and in a few minutes we were steaming down the Thames to our destination. Arriving at Greenwich we " grannied', around for awhile, and determined not to undertake to " graft" any at that time, but to return for our " molls," as they knew, nothing as to our whereaboutL  When we got baok we found the " judies" at home and rather flash of "a sUgr," as they had done full well at " graft tg"t-aa wr oould have expooLed. a        f.   CHAPTER XXXI.

Nextmornlog turned out beautiful and sunsbiny, and it being Greenwich Fdir time, we proposed to our jodiesa" to go down there for a bit of a time. Thie was assented to, and soon they began to prepare for the excursion. uI the meantime, and while they were ; fixtlg up, Joe and I took a stroll down the Boro-road as fir as Jemmy GcantsB, alias Captain Grant He had lately been " pull[ig the bag away," and having sa numerous family, thought that now was the time to 'tuarn up gonncftieg," and do something for them on the " equore." With that intent he hired the house lately occupied by Jemmy Ta0lor, the " knuck," and called the Two Brewers. Here he opened in the chop and ooffeehouse line, but failiog to make this pay he took an oocasional runn oat n the " dp," leaving his wife at home to look after the " clib," and attend to the young ones. Captaia Grant was a skillfal " buz- man," and reckoned A. No. 1 among the fraternity; butoa one of those "dipping" exp:.ritions he got i tumbled" to by the conductor c, -in omnibus in whioh be was at " graft," and given in charge for an ,attempt. Things looked rather blue, and he was in danger of " ooppiog a drag" when it occurred to his u moll" that, could she but find the address of the lady upon whots he was pratoicieg when the conductor "piped"him, she might prevail upon her to forego her appearance, and with able counsel get him " turned up",' With the connivance ofa " peeler" she obtained Immediate aooess to the charge sheet, and then don- ning a borrowed suit of deep moUrniog, off she started with her four " kids,'* hand in hand, for the lady's rest. denoe. Upon befog admitted she began a piteous tale about the death of both her parents within a week of each other, and worked so cleverly upon the feelings of the lady that in a few minutes she had her in the desired state to broa oh her real errand, and ere she left she ob- tained a promise that nothing farther on her parl would be done to her husband. The conductor being known to old Bill Dann, was by means of a "sweetener" alao indauced to keep eshady" on the day when Jemmy was brought up o r remand; coneequently there being no one there to press the charge, Captain Grant was discharged. Thib last " pinching" scrape rather took the mettle out of Jemmy, and he revolved in hia mind what was beot t   be done under exiting ,olrumstances, Finally, he came to the conclusion of opening one of his up-stairs rooms for the use of " guns" who wished to try their luck In the " epieling" line, charging a per centage to eaoh player. In a short time it becsame known among the "egnus that Jemmy's "orfth" offdred a secure rendtzvoua from the prying eyes of the " coppers," and to it great numbers went, usually about the time when " buzzing mobs" were expeoted home from " graft," and, after pitching into Jemmy's chops and steaks, &o.," slung" for their grab and snamansed' up the "dancera" to join in at whatever "spieling" game was on the board. Although it was well on in the morning, whev we went in, and'a very unlikely time to meet with any of the" cross," we were surprised at finding quite a crowd up stairs, engaged at nearly all kinds of' a"piel i*g" gemes. Among those we noticed there,. were Flash Carly, Teddy Grapes, Tom Wade, Artful Allen, Bthy Hughee, Fred Sparrow, Boozsy Brown, Red Mick, Charley Peroival (then a "tfly flt,"),.Harry Sheriff and Bob Coombs. There were many others who had been brought in by the diffdrent " mobs" and who were strangers to Joe and me; but all were en- gaged in trying to win eaoh other's "sugar,' Many more had been during the previous evening and night, but bhad "' nmased" to their "doea " complete "f nkt nersl.- We has promised the "molls" the trip to Green- wich, and knew that they were expecting us to take them, olse this would have suited us to a T, as Joe said. As it was, I had f pretty difficult jb in getting Joe away. When at last we did make a move in that direction, it was with the understanding that upon our return to town IUshould accompany him to Cntain Grant's " crib," where, he vowed, "Sam. on 'am 'dd / quteal afore 'e left 'em, else %ed go tu 'ell." Upon our return to our "Jadies" we found them all ready for the trip; so taking about as muoh "saugar" a we thought would ba neoeamy for the eCpeona of the day, off we "namaned," arm-in-arm with out "molls" for the station at London Bridge. As we 'en- tered the railway station, I observed several " fl-cops" on the " pipe" for ".oross coves." As I happened to "pipe" them first, I had the best of them, for I imme- diately " atalled my mug," and with the help of Jeasel managed to get into the ars unperceived by them. Ai for Joe, none of the " cops" knew him, so he passed by quite safe, along with his " judy," who wore a thick- veil, purposely to oonoeal her features ftom gentlemen of the " force." In a few minates after we got seated t the train moved along, and shortly after we were sel down in the good old town of Greenwich. When we first entered, the oar we secured a fron' compartment adjoining the rear of the locpmotiva, which compartmnent was separated from the others by a partition reaching to the top or ceiling. In this we thought ourselves fortunate, as we could talk and act without the fear of being seen or overheard (at least we o thought eo); and being but so short a time " pliced,1,   we whiled away the journey by indulging in a few of the pleasant privileges belonging to married life. Bat what was our surprise upon alighting in Greenwichb elation, when we were surrounded by the engineers, drivers, guards, &o., who with broad' grins on their "mgs' ivqtired in a loud whisper: "How did you like it?"  "Did it taste nfcer' "Was'nt it lovely 9' - My eyes! what a mouthful you took 1' "What 'll yon take to swap on the up-trip ' "Wat t' 'ell du they mean?" asked Joe, facing me wih a surprised and indignant air. I explained to him that I srmfeed they had been "grannying" us while we were in the car, and no doubt inferred from our loving propinquity to our "molls" that we were oin a Grenawich spree, with a couple of willingladies' -maids. "Si tha," said he, bending on them a look that said that as plati as wordy could have said it; "si thau an than dusent tak' theesene o8f very suin, 'ithout say- in' annuthur ward, I'll mwlk eum on yer fayces as fl t' a pann-cake. N3w, talk moetis t' wat 'm sa ia' or sum on ge 'll git a hot-un!" Bat these words of Joe's only served to increase their merriment and j:bes; and one more forward than the rest, punaed his oompanion violently against him, though he profted nothing by it, for Joe in the, t wink. ling of an eye sent one of his home-made Yorkshire hits fall on his " smeller," and sent him reeling against the wall of the station.  "Now, taik that, than puddin'-'eaded rascal, an' leave respectable country fokes alone, w'en theiy cum tu see t' fair; an' iv theeirts annyone on ye's w'at wanBa nnntner dos   o' t' same stuff, let's 'car froo ye t                      V A  crowd had aollected around nu, and jast as some  of the d rivert' "ohnums ' were pickiog their fallen d comrade up from where he had fallen, by his rebound a from the wall, a policeman belonging to the station r made his appearance among tu, and upon the driver's complaint, Joe was taken in charge, and led off to the ., police station-house. Thi was rather a bad begin ning to our day'a spree, and savored of anything but n pleasure. What if Joe should be "fallied V"-per- tr hapa "cop a   drag" or, it might be, a" sixer," for e by the appearance of Lhe ' fl t's mug," covered in tl blood, his nose swelled, and his eyes taking a hue al. so together unnatural, thing8 were likely to go hard with p my "pl." This thought made me resolve on what I tt should do, and going up to several gentlemen who S were present at the whole affair, and who by their w looks  seemed to sympathies wi(h Joe, I begged of them aI as a  favor to steprInto the police station and describe ki what they had seen of the occurrence, at the same  time telling them  thht he was a respectable shop keep- er from Yotrshire who lately had got married, and had in brought up hit young bride to see the sights of London *a and its vicinity, and that it was hard that he should be hi insulted and violently nsea by terminus attachee, who Were proverbially known for their insulting and over- wy bearing character, and that merely because they con-   J seldered him a greeshorn and unlikely to resent eithw, it unmanly abuse.- This pill wal swallowed, and three ,b of the gentlemen accompanied us to the police statioe  s, and from there into the court-room, where sat the ma- it gistrate examining some early offenders of the day. When the charge was called on, the driver state- t' that, without any provocation whatever, the trisoner d struck him a terrfic blow on the nose, from which he , was afraid he would be unable to work for some timeo e as he already felt his sight failing him in consequenceo ro this several of his " chums" gave a similar vergioe n and Joe was asked what he had to say. o   "Well, yer 'onor, iv thau wants tu knoa iv I 'it that: j the-ir scamp i' t' noae, I sall tell t' truth.

I hadl "piped" a London "copper" belonging to the F^l (Bow street division), and afraid she might be reoong, n zid as a London " gum," had" pratted" her into the tavern next door to the court house, relying upon te, i evidence the three gentlemen would give, to do ab that was possible to be done in Joe's favor, and aw soon as I heard Joe call out for Mrs. Goodenough, t prcised forward the three '" swells," who then stated that they appeared as witnesses of the accused. Thep give their statement as related above, and said thatv were they placed in a similar position, they woul(d na. answer for a  different result This decided the matter and Joe was fined a crown (five shillings) for breaking the peace I In a   twinkling Joe's "deuce" of  " half bunllal wo in his "duke," and "  chucking" them over on to tib *able, buttoned up his coat to his chin, and elappinM his "cady" down almost over his eyes, oriod ou0 "Now, iv the-ir's onny more as waunts five shilibis worth, follow me." No one seemed willing to annept Joe's offer,so whtA,   m got to the outside of the ocrt-house, Joe pressed oe three gentlemen who spoke in hts bebalt, to " talk rmmiat" for their kinnes, and in we all went, ex- * wpt the "molls," who Waited outside, and drank a ottle of wine at Joe's expense-he keeping them in a ;suglffg humor by his description of what took place b the car and the unfainess of fining a man for licking vbully who interfered with his conjagal rights.

Greenwich is a very busy, thronged place, naring fair time, there being scarcely walking room ,jen in the middle of the street, and so well is the '%aush" of this place known to the " fawney hunter,"' "thhop sneaks, etc., of the metropolis that upon every ih occasion tribes of such small fry make their way down here and get their hand in a higher scale as ttolok bzzaers" and poeket-hankerohief thieves. After squeezing ourselves and " molls" through a 1st or this " push" until we got nearly opposite one Eathe shows; and feeling almost choked with the- boa and dust, we entered a " lnsh-drnm' on purpose tpawab out our wizzens., While standing at the bar a vt vender entered and Jessie bought eome, upon which she put her "duke" to!er "kick'* for the sugar" to pay the man, but lo  and behold no sugar" was there.

Outside, and around the entrance to the hospital were numbers af old tar, some on one leg, some on two, and some not odn any; others were blind, and others agaid minus an arm, or it might be two-while here 'and there a crowd had gathered around an old salt who was spinning a yam of former times, when he assisted at the taking of such and such a place. At one of these crowds we saw two or three ladles listening, who, from their appearance, seemed to " carry the bag." ' Dost than think their's 6wt lykely ta be "ad froo 'am T" inquired Joe, in a whfiper. sWell, they seem to be country ladies, and may have come from home on busiess; if so, its all a chance whether or not they have gone through their ' sugar.'

Here they were invited in enter by the cook, who was a pensloneT af the hospitl, and who made " 'b wa' money by Ahowing vaittors the wonders of the Greemwich Hospi- al kitchen. Along with the party in'front, we entered AMa hitahen/where, la some parts, we got rather crowd- ad, owing to the narrowness of the place. This was vur opporktte y; so, " otcffitg" to Joe's " mqn," we 4loaed hn and surrnonded her from observaGan while st 'f work." In a twinklingt e " pok came off," and , dighgng" it to Joe, she lft the u moll" she had m41 pped" and " *s*led her mag" towards another of 4b* party.

The second contitad a few cards and about a couple of " qutd ;" while the third, which came from -he eldest h jcrdy," had seevr  " quid" and a check on *be Bank of England for two hundred and twenty-five 1ounds. "Oh! bloody 'Igh 'anging tu me-look 'ere!" said 4o*, as he " flaahed" the check; ' wat's than think o' At 'ere? Kan owt be dun wi 't?" I looked at it for a moment, then at the clock. "Joe," said I, "If you'll chance it along with me, I think we can make this pay for the trouble it will esat us-it's now within an hour of the bank closBag- dre, bull if we catsh the train that ought to be going away about this time, we'll stand a good chance of gaining our b jeot.

Then giving direotions for our "' molla" to meet us at ltondon-bridge station in the next tlpin, we left them aeme " sugar" to pay tlair way, and off Joe and I wtrted for the cars. Jtst as we entered the station, 4e engine screamed; the next moment or two we were aboad and off for the "juig." CHAPTER XXXIT.

We could scarcely have been more than fifteen or Twenty minutes between the nailing" of the "moll0"   and our departure In the cars, yet it struck me the "pokes" were " blewed," for in the ame carin which Jooe and I were seated sat a mlddle-agedgentleman, as like one of those who attended the "molls" we ' dipped,tt as two herring in a barrel. If it were ho the thiog was "Crabbed," for, nu, doubt, he was on his way to stop the pqament of the check. After a little reflection, I decided upon what course I should pursue in case my surmise turned out to be correct. CGalling Joe's attention to the " bloke"I suspected, I told him under no consideration to let him out of sight until 4 o'clockt, and if he made for thd Bank of Eag- land, to be sure and enter before himn, and give me the "offle" of his approach that I might have time to get away, but that if he didn't steer for the "jug"' he could "turn him up" at 4 o'clock, that being the hour when. the bank closed and whan, atl betag right, 1'd be on my way to the hotel, opposite the tesminum. at London tmoge; where he was to meet me. Just as I hadt got through with giving Joe directions, we reached the station at London bridge. Oat I flew like lightning into a " handsome patent safety cab," at the same time giving the driver orders to drive like blazes to the Royal Exchange, opposite the Bank of England, and like blazes he did drive, for which I "e slung him half a crown, although his fare was scarce a shilling. As soon as I could cross the street, I rushed pell mell along the passage and into the bank, where, going up to a gentleman near a desk, I presented the check, and was told to go to the other side where the checks were cashed. Oier I hasted, and handed him the check, which, after, examining, he laid on one side, and oh, thunder I asked me " if I wanted it in gold 1" Gold'? aye, or anything else, I thought, but I said gold. Oh! how my heart palpitated- with the thought that the "bloke" might make his appearance before my business wan settled and " grab" me in the act 1 If that was he In the car, te could not now be far from the " jug." For heaven's sake, make haste, I had well nigh spoken, when a shovel coafaing the "quids," was emptied on the counter, and without counting them, I gathered them up in every possible way and thrust them into my " khicks." As I drew towards me the last handfual, the door opened, and Joe, with the sweat pouring down his face, entered! I knew what that meant, and slid out of the office, the door of which had scarcely closed after me when the clock struck four, and in a moment the bank was closed for the day. Out I got and into a cab, from which I could see, while the driver was preparing to start, every one who came from that part to the bank, and, lo! among those was the gentleman whom I had told Joe to watch! He was only half a minute too late, but that was enongh for me, and so, all being lovely, I dismissed cabby at the hotel, London bridge, and, calling for a private room, was soon sitting smack- ing a real havana and sipping my delicious champaigne. "Huarrah!"I thought, " who wouldn't be a ' gun?' , and rattled the " quids" about in my " kicks," keep- ing time to a favorite polka of the day. In the midst   ofmy pleasure I heard the arrival of the Greenwich train, and in a minute after the two "Jadaea" made their appearance and joined Joe, who brought them to the hotel. I had told the waiter that if any one inquired for Mr. So-and-so, to show them up, and in a short time we were all together, and a second bottle called for. I wsa unable, while at the bank, to inform Joe of my complete snccess in the undertaking, and to all ap- pearance, he believe'd the " pitch was crabbed," for, upon being seated annd" piping" the champaigne left by the waiter on the table, he inquired: "Wy I dou it run tu that? Did than ' get it off to ryghtat Wy doza't to' crack a lay' an' put a feller eont'n 'n z miz'ry?" I had been lolling on a couple of ohairs, and not aoeming to care for anything or anybody, which put Joe into agauessing turn upon hi entrance. My silence upon Ida ooming in, and after beiag seated, seemed to him ominoup of a failure, but how' to fixth satisfact torily in his mind with the evidence before him of two champaign bottles, costing at least one pound, was a puzzler. At last, seeing I made no beginning at an ex. plosion, he put the questions as above. ' I answered by asking him to hold his hat, which he did, while I drew the" oquida" by handsfal from my "t kicks' and slung them into his "cady." The "* moll" closed around, wondering where the "raise" could have come from- they not having been fully informed of our intentions when Jue and I left Greenwich-and as each " dake- full" war thrown into the " ti'l" an exclamation of complete surpriee fell from them, while Joe fairly danced with delight in front of me, with "cady" in hand, outstretched for my " duke." "Well, thunner my b---y eyeseout'n mti ead iv thM '9re duzzln't beet cocklyghtin' I Anny moarr' hold- ing out his hat, ", anny moatr Keelp at it, and I'll go to 'ell iv I doan't dance a 'ornpipe on mi 'ead wen thanguit thru'!"But I had gotten through, and in oaee of a" crab" by the waiter or landlord, dispensed with Joe's wonderful "'ornpipe" till a more befitting oaportunity. We put the " sugar" round, each taking his " moll'" whack along with hi own, after wheh we settled our bill, and taking a cab, drove home- Joe reminding me, on the way, of my promhie to ao. oompany him to Captain Gaant's that night. When we arrived at home, Joe and I changed our "rig," and unknown to our "jadies," prepared for our calt at Grant's. Oar " molls," feeling rather tired, deoltaed our offer to take them to the " gaff'-the very thing we wished, and bad we not known this be- fore asking them, we would have said nothing about it ; but in case Jessie should feel lonely and disheart. caned during my absence, I requested her to write a let- ter to her mother, and as a " sweetener,"' "slung her a finniff" to inclose to the old woman. I then " plant- ed" the bulk of my " sugar,'" and with the remainder in my " kik," left the house along with Joe on our second visit to "Captain Grant's."  On our wAy there, and when we had reached the Obelisk, at the top of the Boro-Road, wo were startled by a sl'A f,'   ,slap on the shoulder, and. upon looking round, di. covered our old " palF'-e of PAlksatne, who had "eased" the old ldy at the Castoms depot of her "poke?"  ," Why I where the blazes have you both baen sinco last I saw you?" he said, as he extended both hands for a shake. , As soon as our surprbee had abated-for we, for tho moment, had felt raythir white about the gills, sup- ing it to be a " peeler s,", salute-Joe answered: "Wy, wi've bein 'ere an' the ir, an' almost iv'ry we-eir sin' then-but we-eir's than bin, an' 'ow's thau bin' doln' I' se think than's bin' ' avin' 't off' laitely, by t' looiks o' thinge-- sparks' i' th' brest; 'sparks' i', th' 'duke,' an ,' thinble' i' th' ' kick I'-'appen sum oi tlM foaks 'ave ' oroaked' an' left the t' ' swag,' ;" sNo, nothing of that kind; but I'll tell you, only first let's go into this r lush drum' out of sight, for I fear there's a ' screw loose,' and iLtM safer to be inside than out." With that, in we went to the "Dake of Clarenoe," at the'corner, and after a "1 lush" was called for, he proceeded: "You remember when last we were together, I de- scoribed to you how unfairly I'd been treated by those I ' grafted' with, in regard to the ' turning out of tho esugar' belonging to the ' pokes' that were ' nailed;' well, eira, I made up my mind then that f I eonld not find a ' pal' whom I could trust, whether absent or present, to turn the whole of them up and ' graft' on my own ' nut.' Well, sirs, I took a ' nua' with one or two for a short time, on purpose to find such a one; but may I be corpsed if they didn't turn out all alike- all of the same kidney I As soon as a 'poke' was *brought off' and ' slung,' the 'stall' who ' copped' it from the ' wire,' " namesed' like as if the old 'Arry was after him, and the next we saw of him-the ' poke' had been 'turned out,' and next to 'shise s  brought to light!' I stood this a turn or two, until I felt con- vinoed I was being ' shoved ;' then, without a word one way or another-for I knew  'twas of no use-I left every one of 'em and 'grafted' for my own 'jills.' I have been at it ever since, and now I can 'flash a spark' and ' thim' as well's those who did so at my ex- pense, and who, if left to get it for themselves, would never see the color of them. No wonder the poor ' wire' is so often borrowing in bad weather, and no wonder those mean lazy hulks furnish themselves with warm apartments and well stocked cupboards, 'ridge thimbles' and ' spark fawneys,' etc., etc. Why, sirs, in my opinion, the meanest crawling thing on earth Is a ' weeding' ' stall.' And look at t'other side of it! Why, we all know thst the ' wire, runs ten chances to one more than the ' stall' of being ' pinched,' and when 'dragged,' if he gets off so lucky, has to ' do' alone, and without a ' pal,' hi9 dose of ' sturbin'-living on 'skilly' and short commons all the time, while those big gentlemen, his 'stalls,' are well provided for, in ;mo td. cea, uet of what they have ' weeded' from the   snffering and nsfortunate 'wire.' Fagh! lm done with them, and I would be glad to hear of every 'wir' h the world 'turning up' those oonsequential vam pyre,.

Bat neither of you have told me how you have been getting along; how have you been doing ince last we met?" I let Joe do the talking, and he answered: "Oh, puttie fair, taikin' awl things intu akount, but we've bin a 'ogs-'ead o' ' kelter' onwt in t' waiy ov expenses, fur than sea 'im an, I 'ave bin ratlil' awl thru t' kau- try an' bin i' Skotlan tu 1" "Ah I had a notion of taking a run down there too," replied he; " what sort of a place is it f and can a fellow! graft' with any safety I How is it for ' fly. copl?,"               - "Well, IM tell thee.

Our friend said he had nothing particular to oocpy himself with at that time, and, to pas away the time agreed to go with us down the Boro0 road to the "Bold Captain Grant'e." While in the "Dake of Clar- ence"' the three of ns had managed to put away a couple of bottles of wine, that being the usual drik among first-clae  "guns,' when they wish to keep style but as with othem of a lower distlnction in "fakeology, if the "bagy" war "not thar" neither was the wine.

It was in this wise: One nifnt he wastsorely pushed for the " ready," and hv- tag to go to " doss" without hMB supply of " chuck," (irong pigs' cheek, very strong greens and potatoes, procured from the threepenny-feed " slumi' in Back- erldge street, SL Gilea,) resolved to make some of his fellow*l gen swest for it, Inone corneref thespart- met Jay a tall stout lMilesian, who lived by keepiog a fruit stall in one of the squares close by. ge had been a lodger of irn.

For ome time after Artful went to bed, he lay turning those thiog3 over in hi mind, and at length the time for action arrived. Stealing softly out of bed, he drew on his stock- kna to deaden the tread of bb feet, after which he crept slowly towards the Irishman's bed. Ar- rived there, he cautiously felt for the -" bloke's kick. leme" whee they were Wont to be plmacd, under the pUlowr, but no " kickelM" were there!

I'll bet my life he's been " luashin,', and jaut thrown himsel' down in his " togs." Let's see-and with that he com- menced fingering about the "I kicks" of the " bloke ;" but before he oou'd secure the " posa" he was grab bed, vise-like, by the aroused frua-dealer, aud a grap- ple took plaoe between the two, daring which both   I were thrown on the ad3eoing beds, on the top of others who at once proceeded to lay around them with stlckM wooden legs and crutches, until a perfect Beslam was made of the "' padding ken," aind a general fight en- sued.

Daring the Fquinble with the Mileasan, Artfual reoelv- ed a severe wound near the eye, from his opponent, und whea morning sam, up started the fruit-dealer irt k qcat of the robber, whom, he said, he'd know from   the mark he was certain he had left on him. After going the rounds of the beds, he stopped at Artfu'o, and asked him how he came by. the mark under his eye. This Artfual .coouted for by ayfing he got it from some one while mixed up in the 0fight; but the Irishman was not satisfied with this, and boldly de- clared that he thought Arttful the party who had at- tempted to rob him. 'lhisa of course, Artful indignant- ly denied, and challenged the lileslan to single com. bat. This, owing to the irjuries which he had re- ceived. was declined, and the Irishman retreated to his "doss," and, while 'preparing to stretch himself, picked up a piece of a shirt-collar. Upon examining rtful'o " flesh-bag," sure enough there was the torn one; and in spite of all he could say. to the contrary, he was convicted by the general assent of the room; then the landlady was called up, and after a severe lecture from her ladyship, Artful Alen was expelled from the premises. Without '" buck' and without a home, he knew not what to do, and in this condltion the keeper of a crosman's lush-dram!" near by found him, and, pitying his misfortune, took him in to help his boy to wash the beer pots, etc., soon after which he became acquainted with a second-rate picking-up mall" and went out with her as :' bludgeoner." From that he came to the Barry Side of the Thames, and at the time we met him in Grant's was following the same precarious method of gaining a livelihood. A few words were sufficient to put Joe " fly" to the charatcr of these hangers-on, and they were scarcely given before a move was made towards us by the very pertis we had been speaking of, who seized us by the buttonhole and gave ui the " whisper." "Lind thee a krown!" respondedJoe in answer to Artfal's " whisper"'- Weer's thau think  Ir'e got krowne I'd lgke tu know? Daz thau think I steal '?" This Joe said in an cff-hatded sort of a way, as a ' blaff ;' but Artful wasn't to be " bhulaFd" so easily, and to Joe's remark replied: "Of course, I think you steal 'm; I know they ain't lying around in the streets, else I'd have some of 'm d^-- qaiok myself--  ha h-but lend us a crown, will you?" "I May; I'll see th' t 'ell fast, an' then I woint I Iv than wants krowas steal 'm a  I du, an' then tha'll 'ave th' pockets fal, t' salm's I 'ave." Ihad jst gone through a   similar operation wtth CarlX, with a like result, and in turning away from him, was In time to observe the look of hatred which Art- fl cast poGU Joe when refused. The two   balked mooolers now met together, and were soon joined by Ned Triveta, who had succeeded in a small way with our h1te " pal.' It was evident from their man- ner that something was brewing between them, and I determined to keep wy eye on them. If Grant could, by any moans, have - iaduced them to leave, it would have been all right; but he had tried, on oosaatons pre. vious to this, without success, and mmy a " shant" he had  " aslung" them as a "' sweetener," to keep " kysa" while the play was going on up stair. Gradually the,   r room began to fill, aua among the new comers were a , goodly crowd of intimates, brethren of the " dip," the 8 greater portion of whom I had " woxked" with before t " paling-Ia" with Joe. Things began to look e brighter on our side, and in case of a "slogging', - match, we had the decided superiorlty in numbers, ;t G not in artistic talent. Artful had "scrapped" sev. eral times in the prize ring for small amounts, and was osidered a promising " slogger" by those who knew - him, and as for Curly, he was well known as a deter- ) mined rough, and ever ready to " go in" where there , was a ohance of " besting." Ned Trivers was a tall, s atout, well-made fellow, and although little was known i of him In the " slogging" line, yet he looked sufficient. ' ly able and willing to do something in a " muls." The three ' stalled their mugs" to one of the tables In the B. comer, and, under the " stall" of playing " broads," I; concocted their programme. Joe, our Folkstone "wire," iand myeell, were sitting down at the opposite table. Soon we had the Bold Captain busy, wine-negus being called on the board; we took the " broadq" to while away the time, as it was not convenient for Joe and I to "wade in" with the other " pielers" just then, and by the time we had emptied our second g:%se, the door opened, and who hould pop in but our old chum Land fellow " gra'ter," little Jack. He had a short time previous, the good luck to fall over a big I' stake,' a portion of which he made use of in the purchase of a horse and cab, the remainder of the " pile" he was spending among the " guns," wherever he could find them.

This was another "crab" on the delectable trio, and they re. garded ua with looka of bitter hatred. J=ck was pretty *rell on when he came in, and after putting away a ' negus," challenged any one round the table to play himl at cribbage for a " quid a game; and as he spoke, down he threw his " quid" (five dollars) on the table, and in a flash it was dovered by one from Joe, olose by whom it had rolled.

The eards were all ready shffled and ready for a cut, but there was no " stake"' down on Jack's side, and atter "frikig" his "*' kicks" over he found him. self ran out of " sagur." His horse and cab stood at the door, and asking Joe to stay ntil he returned, off he stated from the -room. The door had scarcely cloeed when up started one of thoe mooohers 'and hmtened after him. He wa in time to amp 'on the box Slong with Jack, and together the two drove away. I had kept my eye on the soamp from the begin. ning, and reckoning this with the [rest I observed, I thought it betokened no good and I told Joe so; but he laughed at my nusplbcion, and, devil-may-care like, hoved the wine round like water. In a short time Jack returned, and after leaving hs horse and cab in oae of the waterman at the rank, oppodite the house, made his way direct to the table,where we' at waiting for him. His first move wai to " bolt" aglaes of wine,' and then, with an air of bravado, he hauled out his "poke" and banged it down on the table, opposite to where he drew in his chair; next, he " collared" the a" broad," and in a twilkliog rent them into a thou- and pieces and scattered them on the floor, ordering a new supply from the captain. Grant didn't stomach this proceeding of Jack'e and was about telling Mm so, when Jack observed that he would "s liegs" for the newly ordered "broads' and leave them in lieu of those he had torn up. This sathfod the captain, and a new paok was immediately handed to the players. As be. toe, the " stake" wu a 4" qud" a side, and the game cribbage. As the play went on and the wine came in, the three moochere gradually drew around, and while Joe and Jack were boiled in the game, they helped themselvee without ceremony to the wioe Joe was never selfish or-greedy, far from it; but when he saw those mean huapies-characters that he deated, "whipping" away the nectar that he was psayig eight shilinga a bottle for, his dander rJi and "he opened his mouth and spoke" but not in parables: "Bi thee, mister Grant,  eeir's t' bottle o' wyne I ax'd thee far a few mianutes sen? Wy duan't than bring it along -an' let's 'ave a oup wunce in L wyle; than knoas I s dung' thee fur 't', "Why,there's your bottle of wine, my dear fellow," answered Mr. Grant, laying hold of the remainder in the bottle and pushing it towards Joe, from the cormer where sat the moochers. Joe " collared" the bottle, and holding it between him and the light, , graunled" how much there was left in the bottle, aud then turn- ing towards Grant, said: "Wy, thau doza't give soa mntoh fur eight ' bob' neow as than war dooing a little wyle sen; 'ow's that? wy than waunts t' count double on m, aul   nyght, but than sees I'm, ' fly' 'll  ow a' t han needn't gtt thyaen out o'breth munia' fur anny moro &I bote at eht shUlinge a bottle, far me." Then, looking'at Jack, he sad, "Neowr, Jack, asn 'm in a rry tu goe sum weirs els tu fling way a 'bob Or two, an thmuilyken I'll play th' fur to 'quid' a game, an' then it ,11 be sooinir dun mw'." Jack agreed, and each of them tabled two soves signs as their respective "stakes," and the g&arM was resumed. Captain Grant felt anything but pleased with Joe's idea of leaving the " drum," for it wasn't every day a good customer like Joe appeared, so to make things straight, and a it mesans of detaining Jack and himself at the "broads," he "stalled" his "dmugi" for a few minutes and reappeared with a full bottle of wine, which he uncorked and placed in front of the'two players, saying: "There, gentlemen, youl find that the right size and the real stuff, and I want you to consider it my treat, and aa for outsiders, I hope that in future they will mind their own bnainess, and not try to put a ' crab' on anything doing in my house." As the Captain aid thls, he threw an unmistakable glance towards the trio ot " suckers," who " stalled" it off by talklng to each other, and appearing as if they heard it not. Luck was again in favor of my "chum," Joe, and at the finish of the game he " kicked" his two "qui," and again they played for two " quid" apiece; but thbi game was destined not to end so peaceably as the others. In the course of this game the mooohers and several "crosamen" who had en- tered, drew closer to the players, and one after an- other took hold of the " crib" to see what it was" up to," and among [the rest were the "s uckers," while Joe and Jack played their hand out. In the first "crib," it being Joe's, there was nineteen; this r. equal to "shise," which amounts to nothing. The next " crib" was Jack's and it was a stunner. "I doan't knoa how t"e 'lt is 'e got 'm, far I'm sooIr I thrne out a bloody big bilk; 't looiks bloody querrna tu mi," aaid Joe to me in a kind of a whisper, adding: "'4 Keip than ly'ghu, open, wilt than? an' iV than ' pypee' any bloody ' faikin * at wark ' sling, mi t,' office,' duz t' 'ear?" "r All ight; Joe," I answ/ered. The " breads" were once more hnuffed, cut and dealt; t was Joe's " crib," and, having a good hand to play from, he put out a pair of fives, while Jaek put out a nine spot and an ace. The cards were eut and up turned an ace.  Thi3 made a dozens in crib" for Joe, and what he held and played would put him out. So he reckoned if the start should hit him any way luoky, and so it did; he wanted but five holes of playing out when he reached for the "crib;" but what was his astonishment, upon looking at it, to find aeither of his fives there, which he had put out from his hand, and in place of a good " crib," he found a king, a nine, an eight, a three, and the star was a one-an sae I The "* crib" had been." nrmg",by   mooahern, and nineteen-  e.

Wat kards did thau put eowt Jack i' t'v erib?'  But Jack wouldn't say what cards he put out, and in this he was backed by the " suckers," who advised him to " collar" the stakes until the game was played out. "An' wat th' bloody 'ell 'aa than ta dauwi t' gaim or wri' owt's atween uz?

" Joe was unknown to most of those around the table, including the moochers; and ashe stood up defiantly before the trio, they began to fancy that they might have met other than a " flit," in the "scrapping' sense of the word. While this as going on, I had my "ogles" about me, and at this moment discovered Ned Trivera trying to " plant" some oards in the'oat pocket of Artful Allen. In doing so he let fall a few, and in an instant I 'sprung forward and had them in my " duke." They belonged to the pack Joe had been playing with, and, in fact, there were the four oards which had been " rung" from the " crib"* oppo- site the others, which had been' kept ready for a "ring," but in the hurry to get rid of them TIlvers had faced them the wrong way, and so kept them, as it were, apart from the others. Joe'seezd. them, and taking his two fives in one hand, held thoenineand ace that JAck put out, in the other, sayiig - "Neow, Jack, tell me, is them their tu klrds wat thau put eowt or not!"Bat before a syllable could be uttered, a tremendous splurge was given by the three mooohers, towards where the " takee" lay, and jost as Trivers made a grab at the bright sover- eigns, down came the butt end of a wine bottle on hie "duke," which made it powerles, and hi agony he' retreated behind the others, while Joe, qtmndtng with his hand firmly clutching the bottle by the ncook, and without taking his eyes off the " suckers," proceeded to " fi" the " stakes" to his own satisfaction.' "Neow, iv the-ir's anuy moar uv ya spunging gentle- men waunts wyne, cum an' I'll gle th' t- bottle at a tyme tu.-lyke's than naybor's gotit; an' az fur thee, Jack, thau's aktil aught but right in this game.

But they were again disappointed, for the bold Capt. Grant, with the anidtance of a few "guns" from the other tables, rushed in between the parties and per- suaded them not to make a disturbance in the "drum," as it would bring the " coppers" around, and the place would get "spotted" and unfit for a " meet."

' All the 11 0ro athen 1n the room know that Coombi wrs never m; uh in the way of" graft ;" and many of them believed that ir every one in the  "mobs that he went out  with, had their own, Bob Coombs  odld not have so mush  a he had.  Aware of this, Joe's N kid!' produed  a rotivg langh om those aroun d t the   table, in which, aes r  stall ffr," Bob himselfjoined. On went the gdme and round went the " lash," Bob r still looking out for No. 1, and never letting a glass go aby him. At this stage, Coombs and Folkstone were D ahead, and Bob felt so pleased with their success that h   offered to bet five to three he'd win th game. o "Fjvoe, wat'" (u three?--five ' magi, duz than , meea ?

" Dun I  Btalk th ' kel- ter;' the-'Ira mrne--over It" AgainCoombs had to draw on old Bill who stood looking on at the game and inwardly pleased at Coombs' oertain defeat; for all around could see, ex- cept Bob, that his partner was plsaing too loose, and himself was so "soammerry, that he forgot to take his holes when they rere due.

A half minute more, and the door was flung violently open, and in flew 'Triver, Cutly and Artful Allen. Hastily making their way to the table where sat Joe, Coombs, Folkstone and mysedlf, Artful made a dish at the "stakes," but a well directed blow from Joe's shoulder sent him sprawling in the fire-place. At the same moment, Flash Cuarly and Traisv grabbed' at the ooveted '"sugar," which Artful hid failed in -so ouring. A scramble now took plaoe among all hande at the table, for the possession of the money, those of our party trying to save it for the owners. In the saram- ble, one pitched into the other; the table and obaira were upset, and some fell over the' displaced furniture, while the sound of blows and din of voloei made the room zing again. "Gentlemen I Boys I do you hear me or do you want to 'lag' the ' duam ' at otct Stop this fighting or woe' have all the ' cops' in' the town dow n as,"' shoated Captali Gfant. ]Bt he might'as well have shouted to the winds. No attention was paid to him, as all were mostly engaged in the' "s log." At this moment, Artful who  had recovered from the I send- er"Joe had dealt him, -was in the act of deallbg my pal" a ".stunner" with an empty wine bottle, when, fortunately, I was in time to ward off the blowr by In- terposing at hair between Joe's oranlumu, and the up- lifted missile, fractumiig it lnto a thousand pieoes. FolbbtonD had madeo It s bnRne to lotir ar rC'arlty, while Joe mansged t  floor Nd Trivets, who, had he been sober, would have been a rough bustemer for Joe to handle. Joe happened to' look round it the moment the chair came between Artfrl and himseif, asd seeing the weapon Allen was using, resolved quickly Upon action. Hanging at the fire-place was a heavy brass ring attached to a bell-pull. Is a moment his knife was out, and the flog severed from the pull, with a tail to it about eighteen inach 'long. The next minute he had it Wound round his " duke,'* and with a flying jump he swrug it in the airt and brought it down on Artfal'i nut." n Down tumbled the moocher as if shot, and the next instant Joe was beside him on the floor, from a blow from Carly, who had succeed- ed in lialog our friend Folktone ho'rs du cwont.

I did not purpose 4king much money her with me, not Intending to make a, a tsy ;  but Joe, who rim thonught the family might rfq-uB a shtae, provided the himself with , consideratle aum. I We each told our dm "judies," not to lease the plee they were n ant ow they sw or heard from us; and as they had plenty of "Sgar" there was no ne0essity for them throwing a chance away by going out on the " dip.", Uforn arrived, and while the oab waited at the door, Polkstone made his appearance, bag fn hand. It be- O, ing on his way to the Elephant and Castle, where he "ntended hiring a oonveyanoe, he dropt in merely to see f we had got ttle start of him. After taking a "D band-box full f kisse from cur 4 jadies,"' and re- HE eiving a Striot warning to " keep ourselves to ar- AD selves" while away, we all three jamped Into a g cab, and were driven to the R^ilway Terminus, where, after Joe had sent bs telegram, we took our tickets, 1B and a few minutes after we were rattlivg along on our ; wayto Leeds. Dlring our jqurney'down, we were delayed several times at way-statibns for the arrival of - belated traing, and here oommenced a series of temp. *g tations hard to withstand. Crowds were gathered to- is gether on the platforme, surmiaing every style of acei- le .dent to the late trains; ladles were hurri(g to and re fro, ervously inquiring the opinions of those who e. appeared to  understand the whyeand wherefore Of w! everything, and waild then run back to those they h bhad left with tales of woeful disaster. . Pokes, were I to be had for th0 whistling for, but Joe had said: ', S8 I- thee, ladsl I'm bun tu see t' aw'd man lay'd itt' e grave, an' Imeen tu see it du ryght. He war a guid Un fayther tu me wen I cad du neowt far m lsen, an? itl t' last thing I ken du far im; so, I waunt aul ' raft' stash'd' wile we ar on this business, an' after that n than may pnll' a wagon load ' away.', This, under the eircumstancea, appeared but a rea. 8i onable reqn:et from our " chum ;" but then, twenty, fifty, oa  hundred pounds were not always so eaily obtained as it could be by " liDging the wire' fin those favorable "pushes,", and we felt (that ia, Folkstone and I,) inclined to rebel against our promise. I was standing aloDngide of Joe avt one of the stations while waitiag the. atrival of a due train before ours could proceed, and was regretting the, hard fate that oom- pelled uo to foreg so, many chances of keeping the wire" from  TIuting, when Joe said, by way of pacl. fsiug me: "No'er thee mynd, lad, 'appen at t' end o' t' j ur. aey thau'lt 'ava moar i' th' ' kick' than ir thou wur ta ' graft' every ',moll' i' t ' plioa; anny 'ow, thou'll not 'ave tu wait long."' Just theu I felt a slight tug at my skirt pocket, and looking round, Folkstone " slaug" me an  " affice," the intent of which I did not comprehend, and was upon the point of following him to ascertain his lntention, when     the noream of th e advancing train caught my ear, and thinking it might be nothirg of very great)i importanc ho had   in view, I stepped into the car.   irald along with Joe, and i a few minutes we were ktefUll steam; for our destination. In the hurry and Ijdle  FolWtoune was obliged to take a seat in another tenhiage of the same train, and we heard no more of H  until we arrived at our destination.- I hired a oab, whe Joe proceeded to the baggage department with go checks for our travelling bags, after whioh I re- jnved, and 'made towards where he stood waiting, B*g with others, for their luggsge.' There was a lotty stiff "p'ah" around this quarter, and while ,waderifg what became of our "pal," Folkstone, a , inmmediately .4 advance of us oried outithat her lao was gone, and in it her checks for her baggage. 1sM gentleman ac .ompanying her expressed his opin- ro that her pokt t; had been picked, and the crowd v forthwith put upon their- guard -by the railway educotor, who shouted with all the strength of his Ngs, "-Look out for your pockets, ladies and gentle- ait,fthieves areo around!"Joe's eyes metminein- atMtly, but, knowing I had not" dived" sinoe we left eroadon, I felt a conscious innocence and security -Woh Joe qaickly interpreted as a state of " fybuok mfeourjills.'  r We secured our travelling bags and were walking. rwarda the cab I had hired, when Folkstone ap- pmaohed in a more rapid manner than custotiary. m purrposely pasoed ns, and as he did so he whisper-i "j ' Blew the ' poke' qlick's fdu can, I think they! ,tramble'!"What did he mean? Did he think that; *W  been "dippings' 'the "moll" who was "giving ]Wbf"? 'Whatcould It be? However,'Joe andI got Wto the oab, and seeing Folkstone " sitaling" himself, El a "square," told the cabby to drive to the Mer-' ^atga  Hotel, in a tone lond enough for Folkstone to 4' Thatfeller 's bi'at ' graft' or I'm a liar," said Joe to me as the cab started, "Bt iv 'ee's ' pinched' Jeckon'ee'l1 'ave ta da' it aul 'ee'sen, an' it's a bloody ltad stepper' they've got 'at Waikfe^, I tell I thought -as Joe did, but, knowing his previously expressed desire to abstain from " graft" while on this visat, or at least until the business was settled whioh brought us down there, I foundfit a difficult matter to attempt a "square" for Folkstone, who, fom what had occurred, had evldently been " pulling the beg away." In a short space of time we were put down at the Merliiart'A Hotel, and after *" linging" the cabby hiA re gave -our bags in charge of the hotel porter. While doftig fthis another cab drove up and out-popped Folkstone. I was glad. I must now proceed to ex. ih thhae course of this misunderstood affair. While waitig at one of the stations for the arrival of the ex: peeted train, Folkstone, whose fingers itched to be at '.graft,"' had gone amovDg the crowd and " pulled a i bag away,", after which he sought as, and fading both I Binding together on the edge of the platform he came behind me, and before Joe could see hiss, slipped a "f:kin" into my skirt pocket! This was the tug I felt,   rwhih I have mentio6ne,-but iA hdiitarte to go off be- fore being seen by Joe;bhe hd gliven an incomprehen- sible ilga or ":offloei' to , the r6almeaning Of which was, "You've gota ' kin' in. your tail; don't say any- thingto Joe jat now." I'didn't "tumble" to the "offlee," and was unaware of the'lrceumstance, even while in the rear of the jady, who had blewed her poke" and was giving " beef" at the terminus; but at the moment he alighted from the c b I put my " dake" into my "tail kick" 'and, eavens I pulled out a double-ender." Fortunately Joe's bt&k was turnmed while talking with the porter. I hastily returned it to my "kick," and turning round 'to the advancing "wire" " offioed" him .to keep :' kyas.". This was en Joe's account, for I felt that he was uneasy, under the suspicion that Folkstone had broken the promise and thereby made us liable to arrest at any moment. He "collared" the sign before Joe could notiae anything, and giving the porter his travelling bag to put away, called for some refreshment. When the waiter had left the room Folkstone began: d"There was some ' grafting' going on in that train we came down in, and they got it away, too. I -I know the ' mob' that was ' working' it-tlhey're from White- chapel. Did you notice them?t" Noa," answered Jo, "I I didn't noties anny uv 'em, but I wus afray'd than'd bin tu ' graft,' an' I didn't !ke it aftir t' promiss than mayed; fnr thanu eea, 'appen I d git ' pinched an' then I'd ' blew ' last eight o t' awd man; an'* wdn't 'ave that. fr gyve thousand 'quids' put ryghtVi' mi ,and i  ' Oh I that's all right, 'Joe; you 'see tIknew them well, and when the train started from the! station we waited atso long, Iwas in conversation' ith one I ' them and stepped in alongasld bf him to' finsh our talk.

We elithed our refreshment, after which Jo0 " rung his toggery" and proceded on hisway home. We had ao desire to be present at the meeting, and told Joe we would follow in the course of an hour or so.' When he , had left, Folkstone, with an air of eager niry, turned i ,o me and asked  "Didyou chuck the ' kin away, or di yo trn it I out first-thunner I if I didn't come near a 'pinching'  over it. What doyou think;why, inthe 'jIpus'-atthe a break of the ' rattleri'I had my ' duke' in the same ' molli kick,' and didn't know it was her until I heard t her ' crack' to the ' bloke' that was with her about a having lost her ' sugar' and hecks.

NHear the village of Kirkltal--hmou for its abbey, about two or thre'miles. from Led-t-w"s a& beautiful manuson, belonging to a gentleman who was then on the continent.. He had left a few servants to look af- ter it during his abe nce, embracing the housekeeper, hostler and butler. There were eaid to be great riahee in the house, conatsUDg of silver plate and very valua. bleahawla, and other products of the Indies, where he had lived and amassed a large fortune. This got wind in the neighborhood, and among those who heard of it was ToMFay. To get at this was a puzzler to 9mP for he waeA n " bottle" as a "o ra&kemea," and ftnally he pitched upon Joeo a the one thing needful in that emergency. But at thi very time Joe aas on his "five m inute. tour in France," along with little Jack and myself, and not bnding any " croa coves" Just then in Leeds, in whom he oould trust, hbe resolved to wait for Joe's retaun to the 6ouy.

Tbhi visit of Joe and I gaveohim the:opportunity, after much ' kidding" on his part to Joe, and he hurried up the affair in case something might turn up to again cheat him of having it done. So the arffir stood on the moeaing of the day it was to " come of." Thbt morning came in lower. ing and showery, and during the -day broke into a heavy and continued rain.

We had kept shady adl that day in the hotel where, towards evening Joe Joined us for the purpose of let- ting ausknow where' the final " meet" was to be that night, before going to the " drumn." "AnW' I continued Joe, ' thfaS knoa t' Trafalgar Inn i' Meddah Layne- 't leestthau kfoas it 't (nodding to me. .)

With this Joe left us, and soon after Foleatone and I, after whipping :on oar top togs"-to keep the rain out, walked away down the briggate and over the bridge into Meaod6w Le, and soon after weo Wre sit- ting omfortably in  plor of the prlgo r Ifthe n. We choose to walk through the rait, rthir than, by taking a-cab from the stand oppofsite te hotel, leave a track behind, which might be followed out if ll1.was notright. This inn was of the lass called respeotable, and shortly after our entrance begai to fill with-reg- lar customers, who each had their own corner or'iitting place. Still it rained, and as each custonmer entered hoe-weould make towards the welti-lled fire-pltee, and there steam himself until dry. Yorkshire, above ail the 'shires in England, is most generous in the ize and comfort of its fire-plaaes. Folkstone and I had " sup pedt" pretty often since we-first enteed thea parlor of the Trafalgar Inn, and began to feel in a rip e mood for anything. 4 I wish to heavens," aid Folkstone to :me, " he'd come and let as get at it, for I'm wearying o do some- thing; but perhaps he's ' turned up' the 'dea for to. night. Hark! how it's comiag down! Good Lord I we'll get drenheld, ohoose which way we go-hotel or ' burst.' I wouldn't mind betting a bottle of wine- we don't see either ,of them to-night." I'll take .your bet," I replied. 1 "A' I'll double it," said a voice at my eibow. I looked around in &atQnishmenit, and tere et an ,old frmer-looking peraon who had but latqly eome in, and after ,dryig -himelf before the fire hbad taken a seat on the settee near; to where I at. As I looked at him I wondered who he could be that concerned him- selfwith our conversation, ad was about t9 y gyome. thing on that head when he repeated, in a low voice, evidently with the intention of not being! overheard by those around;  "1 Wy doant ye tak mi bet, lade?" At this moment the door. opened, and a -all person, Ocloseilymuffed, looked in, and the old farmer hastily started to his feet and left the room. What could all thS mean? There was something wrong,; we had been " piped -off' from the hotel! -But then we must have been " put away" first by some one. Could it !'   be that Shad Wade again? If so, he mast have gained his infomaetion from Tom Kay, and Ithatwas the case, no " burst"'for me. Polktonie agreed with me, and we both arose with the Intention of making ourBelves 'oaaoe In that quarter. Aa we were going out, we had i to pawsthe bar, and there, in close confab, stood the two supliious persone aust mentioned.  "Well, let's da it at wnnoe an' not wait till it's too late," said one of the persons to the other, in a low tone.         ; Folkstone and I quickly buttoned up and prepared for a run' or fight, for we were determined not to be taken if possibi; ;and yet; what could'they accuse us of, excepting the " skin pinched" on the way down? but'tsheycould make nothing ofthat As these thoughts flashed through my!mind, one of thewm'hlf turned around. We thought t was a move to ' oop" as, and ith the hboundf a deer I passed. them and out of the door followed by' Folkitone. Helter-skelter, we raused along, spluhlng the mud 'puldles' all over our lothes,. rushing -gainst this pasenger and thst, who haunced to'be In our way, for the nlght was extremely dark, and the lights in the street nearly obscured by the heavy falling rain. On we dashed, through thick and thin, like hunted eattle, until we reached the cor. nerof the bridge. Just then an old lady came to. wards us, holding her umbrella before her face to keep off the pouring' rain. She did not see us as'we tore lOng in front of her, nor had we an opportunity 'of evading her, and the next instant she was butted to the ground and I sprawling on top of her, followed by my "pal" Folkstone, who, being so close in the rear, could'ts top himself. There we were, sor^mbling in the mad, trying who should get loose first and on to our feet, while the cat-screams from the old lady would rival the trumpit of Gabriel., In the midst of our worming to get loose; a emart wagon which we had heard rattling after us suddenly stopped, and the old farmer of the Trafalgar Inn jumped out,. and sea-  ing me by the collar, dragged me off the soreamming judy r'                    l "Wat's t'tamattir T As t  bot - onR ye gon luny, or wat's unp?" Heavens arnd earth, it was Joe t and in the wagonI stood Tom Kay.   I w e as on my f;t,s. , i^to  j-, Stone.  -The old lady had grabbed him by the hair andi  held to it like a drownihg person; but by the united ef-  forts of Joe and myself we tore him from her grasp, after which we jampedinto' the  wagon and were driven away, leaving the bystanders, who . by this time had collected, to pick up the old -lady. Os and away we rattled, over the bridge and up Boar Lane, neither of us talking a word (it was useless to try; the noire of the fast-driten wagon and pattering of the rin prore vented either of us from he'ating a word) until we alighted at a public house iu Now Road Ead, on the way to Kilkstal. "Well, thinner mi blynd, ivI knoa wat's gotten j ?owd on ye I Bunnin' awaty lyke blazes, an' noaboddy aftur thee I an' then rouw lin' abeout t' guttir wi' an'   auwd ' moln' ' t &rrams fit tu be thee great gran. muther! Wat's got '1 th 'eoads?"And Joe burted out in a fit of laughter, in which he was joined by Tom Kay; a for Folketone aud me, we couldn't see it, and therefore let them have it to theiselves-out then.  After a' ", shant" or two we got'In better humor, and laughed as heartily at our mishap asthey did. Their " make-up" was aertainly of a highly deceptive character When neither Polkstone nor I " tumbled" to them, and when the explaiation was given the two laughed uproariously. "An' thau ttk u far ' elskfairs' dld t'a? Wel, let's fill t' bottles anny 'ow; we'll neeid 'm smtoh a nyght as this, I tell th', an' wl' man be jogin'; for it's ittin' putty laite."  We took in our stock of brandy, Joe '" swggtog" one of the bottles, and Ithe other, and as we, were about to leave, he hauled from his ooat poaket a paper containing about half a yard of black crape, which after folding behout into four pieces, and handing one to eaoh, aid: "'Ere, 'appen non on yel waunt ta 'ave yet 'mur 9' 'grannied' weeir wilr goin' tu, so tak' this bit o' stuff an' fix it on t' bestyer kan wi' a bit o' string or sum- mit lyke." We each took the crape, which was to serve the pur- pose of a mask ower th ftco, and I not oe thltt wheaO Folkstone received his piece of crape, there was a shade of foar in his countenance, and an evident re- luctance in accepting the offered piece. OallBg me on one side, while Joe was talking with Tom and fixing his mask, Folkatone, with a peculiar expression on his "mug," Maked in a low voice: "Say, what in thunner's the meanlng of this? Are we agoing to killn any one This looks a bloody queer business to me, and I'm blarsted if I like the ides of covering my  foe with this black staff; 'taint lke what I've been used to, and if I hadn't asked to be in at a' crack' along with ye, I'll be blarsted fIf wouldn't back out I As it is, I'll have no hand in it if there's a likelihood of any ' croaking' being done." Folkstone had never been in at a "crack," although daily and nightly in company with "coves" on the ,"ybat;)"Volbw b"MaaW e  jalo werea " reryesex w talked of in the " start," that style of " graft" betog, as a general thig, customary to * achkamenl" in the country, add to one who had done no other kind of "graft" on the " cross" but the " dip," no wonder it had a rather horrifying appearance with it. I tried to quiet his feelings, telling him I was averse to extra violence, but in all such jobs there was a likelihood of something of the kind occurring, and there was no knowing how much of it would be used. Some were more villainous than others in their treatment on sueh occolons, and went beyond ths requirement of the case, while others used only sufficient to "' equare their jills" and secure a " get-away" (safe retreat).

After looking around the room, tak- ing "stock" of every " mug" there, out they went, and while passing from the inner to the outer door met Joe fall-but in the faoe, coming in. As Joe seated himself he said: "Ttth 'ore platoe is noa wheeir fur uz; they'll pype' uz tugethir, an' iv awt 'rong 'appens tu anny wun on uz, theiy'll keoa wat ' mob' dun it, and ' oop' th' b-y lot on uz.

After leavlng the " molls" we at once pro. ceeded to a tavern kept by a person known to Joe, and there had a supply for our victualling department, after which we hired a carriage and drove out to the Tea Gardens,Knea, te the Cavalry Barracks. After having the horse. stabled at the Tea Garden we strolled around the grounds, which were Plentifully thronged with visitors from the town and suburbs. Among them Joe discovered an old shopmate, and of course must have him to "sup." I cared but little for the "Iush" as well as Foikstone. So, while Joe went to ' lush" with his acquaintance, Folkstene and I ram. bled through the gardens until we came to a small ar. bor, where lately a party had been sitting, but who had jast passed us. We entered, and seating ourselves opposite each other, fancied ourselves in the Tivoli at Margate, but one drawhack to the likeness was the absence of the other sex. This being uppermost in ,ur minds, naturally brought on a conversation about the gals, and after a while Folkstone said: "May I be ' lagged' it that there Mary Ann-whatt ye call her?" (G&lagher, I put in,) " that Mary Ann Gallagher ain't a little 'ripper.' i should like to ' sneak' her away from the town and take her to the start.' Is she up to much in the way of 'graft,' do jou know?"  "Ye," I replied, '." She is a very promising ' piece' as a ' picker up.' Many a ' haul' she gets away with when others, older hands at the game, couldn't get near the ' flat.' This is all owing to her baby-looking  mug;' and yet she's as' 9fly and as strong a ' kid' as eould be found among the whole of them. If you wish o to ' pal-in' with her, I can put you ' fly to the means I you shall use; for I knew Mary Ann well. She is now  living along with Squib Dixon at his granny's, and so is her sister Margaret. I should think he wouldn't fret a much if Mary Ann was to 'namase' from him, for one i ' mollis enough at a time for a fellow like Squib. Folks say that he keeps the two sisters as a conve. t nienee in furnishng him with the ' kelter' when: run out and too, lazy to look 16for more. himself. Anyhow, it z would be no sin to ' nail' her from him, and if you say i you'll ' stick' to her, I'll help you to get her." He promised that if he could but "sne'ak" her a away, he would stick to her for life i he had taken such s a fancy to her, that. he felt uneasy without her, and r if I had any real friendship for him, it would be seen  in the endeavors I used toward gluelng Mary Ann t and him together., "Well," said he," I'll have that little ipper, even a if I have to go into the ' slog' for her; he must be a a greedy hound, any'way, to .want the two sisters at b one time, and blast my eyes if he shall have them, if o I can prevent it. I wish this infernal ' crack' wasn't j coming off to night; I'd try to,have her company for M a while. Yoa see, there was .J 'chance of Icracking I a lay' on the quiet among the heifers in the ' drum,' h else I had a good mind to try It on; but I' slung, her. A an ' ffice' that I was sweet on her, and she seemed O   to 'collar' it, for, presently after it, she allowed me i to 'prat' her on my knee. But here comes the ' waiter; shall we have anything to 'lash t' I don't " care much about it myself, but if I had her here, It ' would go down better. I'm vexed I didn't know , before of these gardens; I would have asked her to come with us." "Any orders, gentlemen?" asked the waiter as he was passing the front of the arbor. "' Yes, bring ua two hot brandies," answered Folk- stone, who seemed to have arrived at a certain con. clnsion; ," and make them strong,', said he to the re. tiring waiter. "Blarst my eyes if I don't go back to that crib, and bring her over here. Will you come with me, and help In the ' kid ' " "Well, let us see Joe, and speak to him about it; it is likely he will go in for a lark as well as our- selves." We finished our ' max,' and went toward where we left Joe; not finding him where we left him, we walked around in quest of him, and at last found him in among a squad of old cronies he knew when on the " square.' I told him Polketone and I felt rather lonely without company, and that if he couldn't leave those friends he was with, which we had no desire he should, on our account, Folkstone and I were thinking of taking a run back to the "moll's crib," and "lkid. ding" some of them over to the gardens. Joe had been  putting away several "shants" sinee we parted from him, and was getting into a first-rate humor, so he answered; "Perish-me iv ,I thowt on it I Wy didn't wan ; on yez saly soa afore t I'll tell thee wat tn du-talk tt karrayge an' ' namase' az quick's 'kan, an' wenn thau : gits the-ir bundle t' bloody 'eap on 'm inla t' konsarnm, drve back agin ta this plaice, an' iv we doan't 'ave a bloody fyne spree I'll go to 'ell.

We found the hostler and got the ' trap, fixed, and off we drove for Marsh Lane. As we passed the locoal ity -where Granny Dixon lived, I thought' it were best to take a look in and see whether Mary Ann was'there and for'that purpose left the ' trap' in charge of Folk. stone, while I "piped" for the "moll."  Before I reached the door I met Mary Ann on her return from the " crib," and hastily acqnainted her as to howrmat- ters stood, " whippingfin" a good word for Folkstone. She agreed to accompany us, but begged that we should take only Janey Dampster and Harriet Mar- shall along with us, as the others were too " lushy" to be seen anywhere. She promised to be ready for us on our return from the " orlb,' and that she would jamp in opposite ihe Selby Terminus, where Squib would be Unlikely te see her. . Back I went to where Folkstone and the ' trap' stood waiting, ayd Informed him of my  eucoess t then off we drove for the " crib.', As we drove up to the door, a crowd of vIllagers came out to "  pipe off" the unusual circumstance, and stooi  4   there wondering what it all meant; we oared nothing  for that. Leeds and all belonging to it, with the ex- eepthn of Joe and Mary Ann, would see no more of us at that time tomorrow, for we'd be on the " rat- tler" on the way to the " start. Fastening the horse to a post, we entered the "crib," where we found them, as at first, passing the " max" around from the brokeanlipped jug and footless egg-cup. Is thau ban tu giv uz a ryde i' th' karrayge,"' ak- ed one, trying to look straight at us; but failing in getting the focus.

"* And a bloody fight more in your face; mor'n I'd like a ' moll' to have if I'd anything to do with her," whispered Follktone. "' Anud th' noiyse, wilt t'a? than druckin kow," shout- ed Harriet.

Harriet was about fixing her talons into the wool of her drunken chum, when we interfered, and whisper- ing that the time was precious, and that Joe wan awaiting our return, we induced her and Janey to make speed in arranging themselves for the ride. When their "-makeBnp" was completed, we harried round the" lush'" which we had sent for, and in they jumped to the " trap," and cff we drove to the Gardens. Oa the way we halted at several ' lush drums," where wa "maxed" in a style. that soon put the three "molls" (for we h ad picked up Mary Ann at the place appointed,) in a fit state for fun. Folkstone oat in the rear along with Mary Ann, where he made use of Ins time In kissing and sweetening her, while I played John along with Harriet and Janey Dempster in front. At length we reached the Garden, and again placed the nag in the hands of the hostler. As we prome- neded the grounds in search of Joe, who should we meel fell in the face but Jemmy, Childs and Jack Stubbs! As they passed they " wefghed-up' the ' molls" and slightly nodded to as, for they knew me from the time Joe and I kept the Two Guns, and well they might, considering the "grease " we "slung" thenm What brought them there t I questioned with myself. It was odd how they should cross our path so often, but I determined to " mark" them while there, so upon meeting Joe I told him of what I had seen, and leaving the girls along with him ,.aad Folkstone, I sauntered about the grounds, and at last " piped" the 'I fly cops" iS conversation with two ' skufters, and, as appeared to me, putting them f' l1 to whbo we were. BI9k I went and gswe my re.   port to my " achbas," but they seemed to think light of it. They had something more congenial to their taste just then, for there sat -Mary Ann alongside of Folkstone with her arms about his neck, doiDg the "kid" in the strongest style, while he, more pleased than a oock with a gooseberry, sucked in all she "rammned" him with. Joe, opposite to him, was do- nfag the double " fake" by balancing Harriet on one knee and Janey Dampster on the other, while they threw him " sweetheners"' in turn -with a iss. "Sit th' doown, mun, sit th' doown, th'ir noan af- tur uz," said he to me; " an 'ere, taik 'owd an' sup. Iv theiy ment ' collarin' uz fur eowt, theiy'd a dun it afoar neow.

Off we set in pairs, seeking a secluded part of the garden; but owing to the crowd of visitors we were unable to find what we wanted, and when we retura to the arbor we had left, it was occupied. "' Thunnir me blyn iv wi mayde owft in that the-ir trip," said Joe as we walked about in vain seeking a place to sit down in; "but I 'ave it; lads, cum on doown tu t" orib' an' I'1 lay wat thau lIkee we'll fynd sumweeira tu ' prat' oursees."

Plenty of hot water and sugar was brought, and soon we had the steoal up, while the " molls," on their part, kept pretty good time in emptying and e refilling. Another ring of the bell summoned the landl lady to get tea ready, and in a short timne the ried ham, aso. &o., appeared, and again disappeared. We  had boeen bout two hoWrs in the gd ens siuce We   bltught thi ' Molls,* and it Was getting very near 1 time that we should leave, as we had to meet Tom Kay' St the Malt ShoVel, in Lower-head Row. So I hinted to Joe, and, contrary to oautom, he sided with me for once, and was willing to leave the company, of his "gal.$' When about to start, and while we were ar. ramging the "spreads", of our " jdies," Joe held up hiso nger as a signal for filence, and immediately after we heard the chinking of silver.

Having ian plenty of time before us the horse was allowed to jog on as he pleased.

But what had been done could not s now be altered, and I resolved that in future I would have a  hand in the disposal of whatever  " came offs,  and that i t would not be into Ned Langthorne's hands, nor any other person's who had to carry favor with , the" cops," eler ', turn up" his " lash dram.,' I had , private reasons for thinking so. Soon after, Tom drove up to the old shed, where he purposed putting np the " prad" and " drag," and t before getting out of the " drag" he pulled a bottle of brandy from-one pocket and a  small parcel from tho other, sayingf "'Ere, Joe, thee 'collar t' tooils, and Irecon than'll fynd aul thau'll waunt tu yuse i' that -parcel, an' tailc a   gooid slug cowt'n that bottle fur lack, and iv eowt 'appeng, let's aul mait our waiy tu 'ere weeir t' 'drag' i3, so 's we'll be aible tu 'nameeo' awaiy tugethIr.

As oon aa t   eicy bad g ae, Folkatoao, bho   lad been remarkably stil since our return-from the t ea Gardens, began:              t I "I wiah to heavens this job was over, it don't seem c to suit me at all, and I cant say I have any liking for it, but as I've gone thus far in it I'll see the end of it. But, I say, what have you done with the piece of crape Joe gave you the other night? I chucked mine away. ' I'm not going to cover up my ' mug' ith any thig 1 of the kind; there's too much of the bloody hangmra 1 about it for my liking., What do you say!' "Well,'"I replied, 4 I have a sort of horror to that i style of dress myself, and I had previously determinned not to put my ' mug' behind it, so my piece has lost itself, and I'll tell Joe so if he asks aboUt it; and another thing, wh never this job is got through with my name is 'namwaer' for . the ' itart;' I don't!ke  any of theoe ' oros3 coves/ as moat of them calls themselves who -frequent Ned's and .the Yorkshire Gray. I know from a certain source that they 'pt away' to the ' oopa' any one who does not hail frohm the same place as themselves. Squib Dixonis ttie only exception I know of among them. And another thing, I think Joe didn't ase the best of ' coonm' when he delivered that 'Iugar' into Langthorne's hands; t would have been much eafer to have 'planted' it somewhere until this affair was over, but now Ned knows all about it, and: if the half of it ain't spent with him he'll not like it, and then ten to one if the whole affair don't ooze out, and then a ' pinohing-do' will be the upshot I Bet 'll bet 't wont be this ' kld' they ' nil'. for I'm off, as I said before, by first con- veyance, as soon as this job is over." "That's my bloody fix' too, chum," answered Folk- tonie.. "Bat, I say, you must help me to ' sneak' that little t moll/' Mary Ann, and I'll do as much for you, wonD't ou?" "Yes, I'll give aUl the assistance that lies in my power to get you two together, and I hope you will do right to her if she ' namasesa' with you; but as for you returning the favor, I must beg to decline, for I am already glued to as pretty a young creature as man coold wish for. Bat I'll tell you what you may do- y u may, upon our safe arrival in the ' start,' invite me and,mine to a champaigne supper-that is, if the thing 1o1mes off to rights.' " "Done," said Folkstone. Wat 'n 'ell's dan neow!" asked Joe, as he crept Into the shed, followed by Tom Kay. "Watar ryez tth on, eh?'" I:thought there would be no harm In tellitg Joe, especially as he had signified his willingness to help in the sneak," when last we talked it over, so I said: "Joe, Folkstone has taken quite a strong liking to Mary Ann Gallagher, and he's rather * down,' thinking there is little chance of 'copping' her away from Squib." Before I could say more, Joe interrupted me wi h: "Than bloody e-edj it, duaz't thau knoa neowt? Kant t'a tell t' littil 'effi iz ' nauts' on th', eh?

Folkstone was also willing, and with. oet frthier delty we helped the bag on to Polks ri ne' back, and fixing everything right astwe came babk through the " crib," 0nce more found ourselves on the safest iMde of the house; Joe fastened the window al most at well as ever and removed the lines from the door, ;and off We '" sneaked'" from the "drum." Joe had given the "Hist, histl" but no Tom an. sevieda the signal, so away we tradged 'to the. shed where we had left the horse and wagon.  As Rwe approached, the animal neighied loUdby,'and put ua in some alarm for our safety, in cabsshe should be heard at the - drum." When We got isfide the shed another "hst 1" was given for Tom, bt hno Tom answered.

This al'usion to " sturbin" set Tom on his speed, and without asking questions, in he leaped, and drove off with speed on the road to Leeds. When we were some distance from 'the scene of our " graft,l"Tom ventured to ask Joe what *as up. 4 Iz the-ir a ' krab,' Joe " "U Iv koorse the-ir- iz," replied Joe, " else doz than   think we'd leev t' plice 'Ithowt bringin' moor'n w'at we ave r' "Oh I you 'AeV gotten som'thin' then-that's bettir 'n neowt Tell uZ 'ow than got ' krabbed.' , "f Oh, than needn't tu -mynd 'ow wi got ' krabbed' just neow; 'appon sum 'un ud 'ear uz tawin'. riu tell, th 't aftur wi git 'ome."' Tom drove fast until we arrived at Upperhead now, where two of us, Joe and I, got out, thinking 'tware sa'est to walk, in oase some " oop" might " granny, us all together in the wagon, which could be done by aid of the lamps on each side of the street. ,In about fifteen minutes Joe and I had reached Let's Court, York street, where Tom resided, and where we met him in the act of preparing to return the :, prad" to its owner. The " stuff," having been taken from the wagon and secreted {i the house, he told us to go hin side and await his return, which we did.- 'Upon his return the " swag', was Overhuled, and a council held as to Us probable value and who to "put it away,' to. Finally, by the advice of Tom, t was de- termined to fence the wedge," and bullion in the shape it was then In to a " mark" whom Tom would bring to the " crib"In the morning. Sleep being out of the question, " lush" was called for, but where to get it ,at that time of night, or rather morning, was a clinch. or. -6oWevor, Joe, tlways ready with an expedient, proposed that be and Tom should go as far as the Two Guns, ind if they were closed, Joe, who knew the "bloke,' had hopes of being served with all he wished to bring. So off to the Two Guns they started, while Folkstone and I, after being warned by Tom not to have a strong "glim" in sight in ase the watchman might observe It, were left in poneslion of the room and plunder. , An hour or so had passed, when Folk- stone. and I heard sounds prooeeding from the yard beneath.. We listened, and nearer it came until we could plainly hear the tramp of heavy footsteps along the. wooden passage, leading to the door. We were certain it was neither Tom nor Joe's walk; but some one it was, and the tepswere coming to the door I "Donuo that ' glim', Folkstone," I whispered,as I $tW * Ga thv vrom Aqq, hatsatag to the adVranolng oound; " tis here they're coming, and who kncowp bat sone thing' wrongl  Keep yourself ready'.' : I could by this time distinguish the trend of at leat three persona. When they got opposite the door they 'stopped, and aftr a ,ittle whispering had passed be., tween them, one advanced, and after softly trying the latch, again retired, and another whispered oonsilta- tion held. At length the party came close to the door, and one of them rapped, in a loud manner, for admit- tance.  "What shall we do?" said Folkstone to me in a whisper, while he clutched the firetpoker tightly in his "duke." "I'll bet my life we're 'nailed dead to rights,' and some of these Yorkshire houuds have put us away. What'll we do t Speak quick, before they are in upon us." I ws   at this moment braced with my shoulder ,   f agani the door, expecting every innt that It would ' be forced open, and at the same time listening for A wrd to drop from eiter of those outside. i Y  "lOpPn the rear window Ireplied, "and get ready foratjuap, for I believe they mean coming in, and thidi's number of the, too." In a seond, Folktone had the rear windowp, ,and: war In the act of throwing hinmelf out, when I reached him. Anoibe rsap at the front door, this-, time louder tha before. ' Next, ahaki4g anda rmmons to open, - "acomupanied with a threat that in caie the demand was not complied* with, the door would be broken open. "Mike haste, Folkstone; down you go, before they burst the Jigger.* 1' Down he dropped from the window, -and I imme* diately took i place aross the stall, when the door, aftr a severe shaking, was burst open, and as they rushed in, I dropped from the window, and, my God I was up to the neck in a cistern of water i In a moment I was seized by a powerful hand, which held me as with a giant's grasp, to the no emall dan. ger of locating me, while a bubbling noise, as of a person drowning, arrested my ear. In  moment I perceived the situation, and grasping the edge of the cistern with one hand, shoved out the other and grabbed my " ohm," Folkstone, by the hair of the head  Hauling him towards the side, I managed to get him in an erect position, and held him so until he got somewhat recovered from his fright* "r BIast my eyes, if this sant more'n I bargained for when I left the star'.

When Folstone bel Into the oitern before me, he had not yet gained his feet before I dropped in, and MWling on,top of him, prevented him gaining an up. right position, and, although it was but a second or t6 he was under the water, he imagined it wru more, mad that he wat a great depth from the surface of the werl (a he thought, for the nfigtt as so exceed- ingly darko hand could not- be seen in front of our eyes*) ', Huah I Foliutone, hush," I managed to asp, for I had not altogether got over the sudden plunge.

Two Guns, without meeting, any one by theway. When I got to the door I saw no -light, and concluded that the "drum" wra " sleowed" for the night, and after trying the door, .was about. leaving, when I heard a, well known laugh from, inside; It as Joe wholaughed, so placlng my mouth: lose to the keThol of the door, Igave a well understood sound,- whoh immeiately brought Joe to the door.

Whle the " shant" was being brought, I gave Joe a history of what happened aince he left Polkatodn and me at Tom's " drum ;" and when the t dehant" and light wm brought forth, we had been left standing In the front part of the " crib!' in the dark, while th *' bloke" went for our "lush." Not wishing to have too many lights brtning at that time of the morning, I called Joe's attention to the dripping state of our "toggesry" "Well fseow#, that's too blarted bad; but, then, lhonu ees it's better'n beein 'kollor'd;' but mny luebluazeza bumr mi, an'-I kan tell boo put mi on; it's mortal kewrius tu mi; wat's thou Ialy, Tom- iwat's thou think on!"t  "Nay, I'm blarsted well Hok'd?

To ask Joe if he was afraid of doing anything as to hbave it done, "Gie's th' daue,' owd fellow, I'm wl th It' fall bat, or 'lay' m. But let's 'ear aul this storey o'er agin; 'appen they'll tell it different t' sekkon tyme. 'Fro Foulkstone, thee let's 'ear wat's up i' t' ' krib.'"   YFolhtone gave a similar description of what had taken place to that which I had given.  "Well, .anow, t-e!r's summit up wat &it ryght, I ksa see that; anny way, wiksn wurk the fthing s that we'll kno fur sooir watit i, s a oum along, 'ere' wi ye".           - Away we wnt in the .direction of Toms " crilb,'" only t&king a differentroadigoiag down the Kirkgtte. and up-Marih Tr*pe, whereas before we always went up Yorkstreet. Aswe walked along, Joe and I toge- ther, and, Tom and Folksetoe,. Joe sounded" me further about the "crab" we were having, and I could see that he was greatly puzzled how to account for it. "I'll tell th' wat it ai, I *mjhin aszow, this 'ere plaice is glttintu 'ot fur this chikkln ; I wish tu t' Lord that ' stul war saif,. l'd ' namase' froo 'ere.

Thisshowed th^dr was some one there, but who itwas neither of us could tell; neither could Tom screw'his courage up to the point of fndiag out, although -he profeased to be .brave when on a "job." What was to be done- we-kept inquiring. It wa a sure thing thatwhoever was men to enzterthe " dram" would be " stack to," and made to account for th0 " swag" found there. ".Ill tell th' 'ow it kan be dun; 'ere's t' waly: Than knas wat kyne o' foaks liv i' thees ' slums/ Tom I Well, the-ir's noe boddy knoas Foakstun i' Leeds, an' sposin he wur ' copped' on suspyhun he ooed saiy he wur looikin fur 'moll' fur t' nyght, or that he war wi wu ann she "namased' froo 'im, an' 'e wur 'untin' ur up," - While this was going on,.we all observed a shadow pas through the room, and taking the light from where it stood, came to a cupboard that. stood beside the window, used by Tom for keeping glm  wan. "4 I'l eat my bloody 'ativ that are's anny ' copper,' annywaly," said Tom, who stood on the top of a barrel "grannying.*' " 'Ere, Joe, let's 'Ave t ' swig' eouten that bottle, an' I'll go tu 'ell iv I doant wauk intu t' ' krib' a' see wat's up. "Aye, lad, than sal 'ave it, an' I'll goa wl' th'-tere, sup." While Joe and Tom were " fixing the max,'"Folk. stone andI were " grannying", the window, and again saw the shadow, which soon resolved itself into the form of a ' moll., "The-ir 'tis agayn, lads; cum .on, follow mi-that's noa bloody 'peeler'-is it?" said Tom, who now felt his valor returning, when he believed there was no me for it. We all took the welcome " swig," and followed close in the rear of Tom, who made for the front en- tane of his " crib." While yet a few yards from the   door, we could hear two female voices in rather high ,alteroation, but before we could determine the subject !0 dispute, Tomsaid i "I noa 'hoo 't-caum on lads," and In a seeond dashed the door open, and the four of ns dashed into the apartment; and what did we see t Fanny Archer sitting!at a table-a pair of pants on. er knees, and a pockethook in her hands, the content .of which she was running over; while long Til Kay, Tom's sster, was lying in ," doss" along with the owner of the pants -an old farmer I "Thunner me blind I 'ere's bloody ' lark,' cried Folkstone. z Iit t?" said Tom, fiercely, as he overheard the re- mark.

TUi, as t have before said in a late notice of her, wras a tall, stout trippor, who made a living by rambling the streets and " ktdding blokes" to her "dgssing crib" on the samo, landLng. as her brother Tom... She generally had -a female "chum," ,ome- times one, sometimes aother (for she often changed, begauso of her pugSllso disposition). At this time she had " palled in" with' a wellknown " torpor," called Fanny Archer, a quondam fancy "moll" of Joe Bolton, the then second olass " wire " of Leeds. Til stood six feet one inoh high, and was a roarer on the mulole. This being oonsdered, it was no wonder she started frome the " doss," and in a very primitive dishabille, squared of at Tom, who never was famous for 'slogging" abilities. We were ill suited for a laugh justthen ( and Folkstone, at least, in our wet garments); but, how to contain ourselveson was th question, for there she stood, her form struck into an attitude of defenoeher "msaleyg" well brought up, and danger flashing from her eyes as she rested them on Tom (her antagonist's) spare gridironbuild. "Cum on; aum   on; thou'l 'aul a leg oout'n mi, wi'taP let's see thee try it; thou'rt a puttle 'ound to 'al1 a leg eout'n annygting, thou is; blat thee, oum on, an' '1 settle thee wi wun 'and; wy duzzent' 'aul as thou salyd, eh W" And Til threw out a feinter to try Tom's mettle and her own diaiahce, but, at this state of the " spar," we, who were on the giggle, burst into a simultaneous roar of laughter; for Til, who at the first commencement of the -" slog" waa in her first robe, by her pugilisti exertions suddonly and without design on her part; beoame u the celebrated lady whom "Peeping Tom of Coventry" was punithed for looking at. My eyes! what a roar of laughtor, in which Tom joined to his heart's content    "Lawf aray, lawf awat, hao klsa; put eout thst lyght, Fanny, wyle I get mi ' togs ;' I doant kair fur ouano' 'en,"'cried Tfl as she grabbed at all and dverr piece of .' tofgeryv" near her, and retrograded into the back room, the door of which she quickly fastened, and piroeeded to don her " toggery." We hiad iarcely got through with our laugh when Tfl re- appoared in all her Kirkgate glory, even to the crim. son "irwpe" worn over her hr"nut," and without more ad, threw herelf into a. cair among us. By this tim the fight and fright was t an all out of us, and a Moch better humor prevailed, m'   1 "SWBZ L MOBD"BsRGAIN POB ,THB BBTUm OF TZE OLD KAN's xOkrr-4MN t PALMB AbMONTBATES BUT i B 0OMPLLED TO LAVB 'H8 BD.-t[L KAY' MAiBS A ' JI ONMTATION' rPON HM WHoCH OAJMi HM TO IBTBB-.THB "MOB"NIMOVB THB "i8WAG'"TO A BAFX rPLAOC-AN UNWCLODn VISIT OF TH   "$COP.

Our money was put into the charge of the driver, with -instructions to de- posit it with the Governor or prison clerk, and a por- Vtion of it to be applied .according(to tie magistrate's order, after which we were crammed into the prison van and drove off to Wakefiald-ten miles off. Oncde fairly on the way and our spirits lightened, the "mo0lS" keeping their spirits up by singing, and the men join- ing in chorus. At the half-way house the t^iver stopped to water the horses, and by great persauslon ,and promises of " slinging," we induced hi'i to bring -or order a " hant," and a portion of tobacco. Not having the "ready" upon us, he was obliged to "sling" for the " max" and " fogua" out of his own " kick," taking our word. He knew Long Til, Fanny Archer, and Joe, and also knew that any favor from him -would be paid back tenfold; so for the remaining five miles we felt pretty easy. At last the van drove up to the prison gate, and a moment after we were in the silent regions, and the heavy iron-barred gate closed upon us for eight weeks I Upon alighting from the van we were put all together (except the " molls," who were taken away by female warders,) in a recep- tion room, while tihe bath, alothes, &o., were being got ready for us; and during that time we were in a oontmal jabber, saying all that we had to say before   being taken out, and perhaps pit apart for the whole eight weeks." What we said didn't amount to much, for there were no messages to send, seeing that we an would be discharged on the same day; but Joe and I, who had been in " walke" before, arranged where each of us would find a note and reply, and put Folk- stone "flyg" to it also. Joe had about an inch of black lead pencil, which he hid in his mouth under his tongue, and when he desired communicating with either of as he would " office" in a peculiar way not as yet known to the offlers of the prison, (there are few " offices' used by prisoners to each other, but what the "screws" are 1 fly" to,) and signal for the "check" (a short piece of stick hanglig by a string to a nall at the "dunniken" door, the absence of which denotes that some one is inilde, and prevents two or'more bping In the same place at one time). Of course the i screw" would allow the "check" upon notioing the sighal and seeing it (the " chck") not in use. and once in, Joe would write his " stiff,' and ,"plant"' it where we had agreed upon. We had got through with our arrangement, when the door opened and the deputy governor, Mr. PFge, entered, and asked our names, marking down in a book what money and other articles we were possess- ed of, after which we, one by one, marched into a room, where the prison barber stood awaiting to shear us. This' did not occupy long, nelther was there much science displayed in the operation. Talk about the Rape of the LoOk-pshaw I From under the shears ot the barber, whose "graft" was "piped off" by a ;" sceew" alongside, we jamped into the bath, certainly a cleaner affair than that in Bonny (I) Dundee. After floundering about in there for ten miautesn or so, we were ordered out, and a' suit of clothes [heavens 1] thrown to eachof a.

My Lord I I would have given a "quid" to a have been outside just then, and to have gotten my g laugh naturally finished and rid of. Joe noticed my t fix, and became as bad off as myself for a " square ;' , and jast then Folkstone had taken up one of the well. , worn clogy, and, instead of heeding the orders of the officer, was critically erinning the wood-work ot n the old clog. "Put them on and oomo this way," e again sung out the offioer, and Folkstone essayed to o obey, but this was something new to him, never hav. e lg even seen a wooden clog before coming to York- d shire. However, he attempted the feat, and had got e about three yards on his way when, owing to his clogs , being worn away on one side to the thiokness of a slx- , penae, down he dropped amid the burst of laughter I that Joe and I tried to suppress, but in vain; even the a barber, used as he was to fresh eights In that line ev- o ery day. had to " 8tallU his " mug" to square himself.   "What's your name t and, what'n.

When all were it and soated, an old fellow, with the aid of some pris- oners, served the. whole with bundles of wool and a beg each, to put the picked material in, and a strong irjanotion given to " pick them buri an' straws eouwt, an,' Ween tu, e'  asum on yez'll 'ave t bow will kom. plalysat tu-morror, myn' wat I saiy"--and with that he left "s Shortly after our day's graft" was eerved out to. us the' breakfast was brought in, and the order to " lay down your work" was'speedily complied with.

Round came the "  head bloke," a prison- er, conveying a  huge basket full of small, very small loaves, along with him, from out of which he tossed a leaf to each prisoner as he went along, after which other prisoners passed among us with a large tin can- full of   preparation, significantly termed " skily.7" Each one received a pint of tBhi faiid food, the measure bMing marked by a   rim on the interior of the vesaeL When all were served, we were ordered to sand- up   for greM to be-sad, which. was given ths: ",For what we are bout to receive, may the Lord make us trhl thankful--Amen., Thankful!

Poor Folkstone, he couldn't stomaoh his " ekilly,' Inor could he stand thesmea of it, and so he laid t beside him 'o the seat; but in the twinkling of an eye it rwa grabbled by a  blue umber at his rear, and quickly polished off, whfo several near him kept"'a fflolg', for the heel of iB ", tommy," or loaf.

So, after a "jolly"  to that effect from me to Joe and Folkstone, we de-  termined to "  cheese cracking," without there was a necesaity for a"lay." As Joe had predicted, so it t came to pam: "Attention I  those men whose num.'  bers I  call, will leave their seats quietly and fall In." c Then commenced the calling of the numbers, and ir among theum ur. As we were falling In, Joe whispered: i "  Dld'n I tell th' t see iv wi woiynt 'ave tnu do' i. ivvry blarsted daly on t' infernal mahsalee-neow f thau'll see.}  When aU who were called fell in, we were ordered h to march, and off they tramped us to the treadmil. a   Who het    en u a treadml for felnst Well, I'll m try to decribeit to you-an Immense equrril esge, rw with a number of pawnbrolkers' boxes in front-there I Wellt into these bexes a prisoner is put, and upon a ', elgnal being giving (the ringing of a steall belD, every occupier of an alternate box instantly Jamps on to jti ' "stepper," or treadmill, and holding on by an lron U bar running the length of the 44 mill," oommeneso his "getting up stairs."

We looked more like spectresthan human beings, and I believe would rather stand a " loobering"' (flog- ging) than Consent to finish our time on the "stepper.'^ So it was sreed between the three of us that, next day if we were ordered on, we would sham sick and refuse to mount the " stepper." That night we came into the room for supper entirely exhausted, and re. solved to take whatever came rather than pat another, foot on the machine; and with that determination we devoured our supper, a pint of thin gruel, and with the others marched off to " doe." We slept in a large room called a dormitory, where were about two hundred beds, ranged in tiers, and,: when the prison was full, about fifty made up on tha floor. To look after this number of prisoners, three or four watchmen were placed among us, at regular dis- tances from each other. These watchmen, owing to the lateness of the hour when they would be dis- charged from duty-having to attend to reports, &c., in the morning-generally brought their breakfast with them, and cooked it by the flAme of the gaalghbt in the dormitory. The prison, at this time, was very full, and, among the rest, Joe, FolkAtone and I camped on the floor, next to each other. Where we lay, we had a good opportunity of whispering to each other, and we made use of it.   "ideow; tha k hnoa wat wL 'ave t du i' t' mornm,'" whispered Joe to me; as we held the bed-lotleos in a- way to prevent the watchman from "-piping"US. '"A bather blarated step I wolynt do fur'm, iv they sail kill mi, an I'm ne'er a kroaker neow. An', saiy, I'll teol thee wat I'm ban' tu du tu night, abouwt twelve o'clock; I'm ban' tu"- Here Joe and I were stopped short by the approach of the officer, who came past our bed with hif chair in his hand. He was shifting his position, and planted himself about two yards from our beds. Of coure,we were prevented from talking now, butI-was all eager- ness to know what Joe intended doing at twelve o'clock. So I determined to felgn - sloeep until that hour, and see r - myself. Slowly the hours pased along, until at length the prison clock strack tWelve l that hour in which I had been so often engaged, along with my "chum," and prison companion Joe, in walking the carpeted floors of the rich and beautiful; and here we both lay on a -prison floor, with the eagerly wished. for hour finging its twelve- solitary tones in our ear. No- idasrky" in hand now; no 4" jammy," to pry a drawer open, or to " neddyf' a "' bloke," within our grasp; nor bunch of" screws" t6  open our way to what we wanted; none of these; and yet twelve was the hour seleted by my burglar "pal." While thinking thus, something passed overiny faoe- a mouse, I thought, and put up myj hahd quickly to -atch it, but, instead, I grabbed a trtW* Now I "tumbled," and slowly turning towards moy ehum's ' doss," I noticed him in 'the act of rising and' nau.  fiously crawling to the chair where sat the officer, who was asleep. Slowly he crept, and at length , reached the chair-it had been moved farther off'- and cowerirg behind the " screw," Joe opened. the s. leeper's canteen (one made purposely), and took from it every particle of the sleeping d screw's"-fod- der, leaving nothing but the cold coffee behind, so that the weight might keep him from " tumbling" before we got- to the wotk-room, -after which we were ' rybuck." Safely Joe returned to his "doss," and after sharing the " screw's" grub into three ,parts, carefully awoke Folkastone, who snapped at the "pinched" bread and butter and ham like a turtle. AL soon as we got through eating, which did not o- -cupylong, he reached over his hind and "lusng" me a small paper, upon opening which I found to my great delight a nice piece of tobacco. The "sre'w" had been supplying himself, and had brought all in to. gether, meaning, no doubt, to have a good smoke in the morning after breakfast, and while waiting, mean. time, to give in his reporte-said reports usually' on- signing some poor unfortunates to a bread-and-water diet, twice a day for three days. Thls was a good haul, considering the place we had to " graft ;' and should the " screw" only Keep from "granDying" his kettle until we got clear of the dormitory, we were all right. B in cae of a " crab"I "cfftced" to Joe to go   to sleep and keep things u fquear we could, uutil we saw how the mor would turn out.0 Son after, Joe, and Folkstone were asleep, and, after taking a , gran- ny" at the sleeping '"'screw" to see whether he was "foxing"'orj not, i turned over; and went to sleep. At the usual hour we were roused from our " doas," and after making up'our beds, pioceedied in sgle' fi'e to the wash-yard, and from thereto to thedry-room ;.and while we were "skillying," the officer, Mr. Foster, oalled out,  "All those men who want to see the doctor, stand up.'" Up the three of us bolted, and the officer, by means of the number on the back of our jacket collat, took down the applicants for Mr. (rokls. To prevent. skulking the " stepper"' it was usual for the offioers to report 'any "wheel-men" who failed in being sick enough to obtain an excuse from the doctor, because, when a Wheel-manv reported himself sick, he was not obliged to " graft" the "atepper" until after the doe- tor-had examined him. This examination usually took place between ten and twelve o'clock; so if they al- lowed every one to report sick without being so, they lost a morning's " graft on the stepper." But we had made up our^minds to stand " chokey," rather than "do" any more "wheel," come what might. )f course I expected to be reported for- skulking, and I also expected my," chums" to be dealt similarly withs but Joe, the indefatigable-the qulokly planning Joe --found opportunity to whisper: "Tell Foakatun tu goa intu t' Jack' an' swaller a piece o' bacocr, an' thee da t' naim; 'sppen: e'ill git throo w' i't. Duz t' 'ear?" I told Folkstone, and immediately afterwards he signaled for the " check." After-he came out Joe and I followed suit, and obtained the " check" after eaeb other. I had a hard matter to get my " weed" bolted, but atjlast succeded, and we had scarcely-got to our seats when Folkstone shewed signs of cholera I He had not been used to chewing tobacco, and when swal- lowing the "stuff" had to be done, his stomach re. volted against the unwelcome intruder, and now he was heaving like a sea-sick looby. Happily the of. cer came in jaust then and called out the sick list, and up we got. and without " gammon," we showed as aick an appearance as .ould be desired. "Crack thau's been tu t' ' Dnniken' a dozen tymes sen las night-duz ta' ear ' whispered Joe, " we pro- ceeded under. charge of an offiler to the ' crocus' of. fice. "Neow mynd wat thau'sa abeout, an' doant ' krab' t' ' pitch,' elze weeir in fur t' 'chokey' sooir." When Folkstone's number was called to go in, he was holding by the lintel of the door, his face as white as a sheet, and shewing "unkidded" symptoms of sickness. His was the worst case of the three, and fortunately, only the assistant was there. As soon as he saw Folkstone, and heard his case of frequent vis- its to the " dunniker," he put it down as something serious, and bookef Folkstone for the infirmary, or   loepital. Out be oame, and as be pade Joe and me, por fellow, he was sick indeed, but be whiepered '  bck,' ' crack,' ' dmmiker,' hard as you can." Joe was next, and ere many mlnutes out he came, throwing me a knowing Wink, which said "ryback" too. My number was next called, Bad In I went. 1 h&te hypocrisy, and always did, but here was a cue almost, I might say, of life or death, for " tepper" is hell non earth to a "gun, saod "' graft" it lorger I was determined H should not But, as I went in I placed every faoulty I was posegsed of In rcquntKion for the moment., Happily I succeeded, and was plao ed upon the liset of those considered serious.

About that time the dysentery was raging in Wakefield, and many of the prisoners wre in the hospit with the complaint. I am not aware whether we were treated' for that complaint or some other, but this I do know: Joe, Folkstone "and I, along wth few othem, were, upon admittance to the hosptal, given a powder apkoeo after which we each had to drink about four gallons of warm terl  This produced an utonM.- ng effect upon us.-strrnBg and heaving, and strain- ing again, until our eyes seemed ready-to start from their sockets  We were all in a roem together,' with the narse (also a prisoer), bottling the hot water into u  by the gallon; eoah had a vessel in front of him, aud there wwe*at, retching and vomiting one against thb other, as if for a wager t "Thaner me a orps I iv I ku-ho-oop l-iv I kas 8tan' ;this--hoop l-.muto LoDsjfr; H-hoop l-mun a blia bloody-hoaop i--' mug' to owelr out that pfaen he i mi--hooooop-swa-.a"Tl, and away oamo  a keg4-li from Joe, followed Ih like maaaoer by Falkstone and ,myselL Apin the nurse of Ut  ward oame forward with his qurtof water and 'offered it' to Joe, who, lookihg throogh   is oweollg and, watery eyelid, 'splattered oot: I "FsTk  that the-err arwylro f t it awayt.

By dea grees the three of na got well, ufichently so to help in the wards, for now the hospital began to fill rapidly with idck, and by making ourselves handy, we saw 0. prospect of finishing our time in the "' frm," We were now within ten days of ourdirhsZrge, whef one day a " cross cove" from Leeds was brought up to the hospital, and upon "cracking' to him, we learned that Tom Kay had beeniehgaged in " fencing', some " broady" that had been " twisted" for, and that Jemmy Childs, auspeeting Tom bhad a band in the at, fair, laid a "plant" for him and "collared him to rights.1 He, wea now lying In York Castle, waiting "patter,'Laud before our release would be tried.

He had scarcely entered Ned's "drum" before he was. cur- rounded by a crowd of 1 guns" and "shakes" prensing him to drink and to take a step along with those dans-' lag to the popular tingea laro. It aeem Joe tred hard to get excuaed, saitng his " butties" were .otside waiting for him; but this only damaged the execse, for in a momentMary Ann, Janey and Harriet, who-wer inide, came running to the door of the cab and fairly drew us out of i  "Come on, wavt the odda?" said Folkstone tQ me, when he disoovered Mary Ann, among them. ' We'll be off to-morrow, so let's have time- whil we're here Thfis beltg backed by Joe and the " molls'"I was prevailed upon to lay aside my arranged plan of keep- ing i" sady," and,:" etinging" the cabby his " ugar,"' we all entered the Boar's Head, and immediately after Ned was ordered to fill every tankard in m  and to keep them eo. This was a Job that Nod lhed, ada while we danedand drank, and drank, and daoned, Ned stood by, watching the ' blokes" aroand, nd keeplqg them buill: looklog for the bottom of their Ipots  We had been in Ned's about: Itreo hourw, ad idarin the whoe of the time, every one, " molls* aM iell aU Mobe" were enoged drinking, exoeptwad t tm time t  hey a'vo ot th0 rto Ot imuA4o of t th-Ug. I-             a-lro, and as may readily be expected, feltrather fa- ny; for want of grob, kad no want of " max," was pilying the dues with us, and 1 suggested to my 'pals' that a little solid provender would mix very adventa- geously with what we had been taking. While saying po, I was overheard by Harriet, who engaged to have u something nice if we would come home along with her and MearyAnn. Ned's was not the best place in bhe world for us to be, id for that matter, neither was that which the " molls" proposed we should go to; but it had an advantage over the Boar's Head. , There waa lens likelihood of " ooppers grannying your mug" while in it. So we all agreed, and out Folkstone and Mary Ann went for a cab to take us there; for we woual rather pay to ride there than be " grannied" waAking through the streets with the " molls," who by this time were getting pretty well known. Before Polstone's return, Joe had arranged with Ned regard. "g i(be " sugar" left in his charge, and shortly after cff we were driven to the "moll's slum," away up Marsh Lane. We were six in all, and the cab being only a single-horse douloe seat, we. were cramped very much for want of sitting room, and by way of bet- ter and easier acomimodation, Joe set the example by taking Harriet Marshall on his knee. This mode of helping one's self to a sufficiency of space, was immediately adopted by Folkstone and my- self, he " collaring" Mary Ann Gallagher on to his knee and I doing the same to Janey Dempster. On we drove, pretty well " corned," and in high trim for a lark of any kind, the " molls" singing as we went, and I we skylarking with them on the way, as much as the length and breadth of .the cab would allow, until at length we stopped at the door of the " drum," when I out we popped, and after " equaring" the driver in we a went to the "crib." The place looked very much  altered during our two months' absence, and altered i for the better. Pictures, and other ornaments, hung around the walls, while a handsome carpet served to t coneeal the many Craks in 'the old floor; a large b looking-glass a&lo embellished the newly bought bu. a reaau and a timepiece, of no mean pretension, set off i the once dirty and neglected mantel-piece. What  thongh they were all "sneaked," with the exception of the bureau, they looked quite as well as if they had been honestly ome by I  What odds then, so long as t they were there "'Twas noboddy's biafz,'" the  "molls" said, and, now that they had got rid of. crm- t my-hkoed Poll Hawkins and the other lazy members of o the "School," they intended to have the ", crib" look b like a palace. Bat there was one greSt drawhack to t the succes of their soheme; they had no " bloke" to J proeot  them--no fixed fancy man who might act as head of the " rib." If they only had that, all would  go right.  tuch ww  the sebstance of a private conversation " oalg with Janey Dempater, she adding, that while  wo were  "dI g" our "deure"  o' "moons '  in o "  wake," they, the " molls,' had put their heads to- n gether, and after a prolonged ", bas9'" consultation, tI   they unanimoudy agreed to take unto themstlves ist, buads, and with that intention they had waited for .,' discharge from "stur,"lead, like love-sick "rmllie,' huastened to see and "collar" us "to rus hts" ibef [ our advent among the S" shakes" in Ned Lmngthhun.' should possibly '" crab" them of their "murks." t,  thermore, I was told by Janey that each of  t  "mollB" had agreed totatce a "crib" near to fC:i' i other, if they succeeded in " pallng in" with us, #;.y that the three of them would "graft" together 0;i all three "oribe" were stooked with furniture, vut. As far as the renting of the " cribs" was conoerm k that was all right, for the people who had re'rt them, disgusted with the oharacters beside them,.,l lft, and immediately after they were secured 1," "speo"s by the "molls."' I could see by Jana,. manner that she thought our agreement with all St ;. was "a good as gold," and I 'let her for the tWI* believe so; but I had one already, one I would :  give for all the "shakish"Janeys in the world ;- Oe. as I thought of her, it brought to mind that I had . tended, along with Folkstone, to leave Yorkshire   mediately; so "oflioing"Joe outside the "drnai I Pbked whethtr ho intended going to York Cut,..h , not, for if he dld, it was nearly time for him to usi... He had almost forgotten all about it, but now he * ., clear from Harriet, he would take leave, and strt ^.; the cars. This he immediately did, and, telling rr,* would expect to find us along with the "mollX"F-.. hisreturn, off he went. As for Folkstone, he imagi*' himself " rybuck," and appeared to take things va*: agreeably, now that Mary Ann Gallagher and hiam*,"* were ".thick." I took an opportunity that eveninrt* tell Folkstone what I had heard from Janey DaaIT. ster, and that I did not mean to comply with &hW. scheme. As for himself, he could do as he liked, A. my destination was London. "Why," said he, " that's jst the same as Mary A-1 told me; but she said that ifSquib Dixon got holId4 her at any time during my absence on  ' graft,' ,i surely 'muzzle' her; so instead of taking a 'At;" in Leeds, I've ' kidded' her to 's nmase' with me. the start, and as soon as Joe returns, we'll take '4 ' ratlerp and ' nam.' 1, That evening we spent at the theatre along t ik the " barteaheys" (" bartemey doll" means a " mwe vide new cut slang), seeing the play of the " Wepti;  the-Wishton Wifh.'"In the morning we dresead '* our journey, having'called the previous night for 4% bags, the Elephant and Castle being t'cxt dodr%. the theatre, and now all was ready for i; start 'rF Joe's arrival. But hour after hour a, ;ved, *an'{ Joe came; so, seeing that it was too latcu o get  ,';C, that night, I proposed a walk to whilo away the it , Mary Ann pleaded to come along with us, and oaW'lt "quiet". Folktone told her which way we were'U t ing, and where to meet us, for we didn't want 1r*t other "  mo all" along with us in the streets. It ', market day, and the streets were yet pretty * ': thronged with farmers, drovers, etc., who fromolar- (   lparanoe e had been enjoying the tante and fiavor of Ubeds " tlyl." Among those we noticed was pne who g-magid his way along and across to the brandy hole e old Baenv de, corner of Call Lane. Ee looked a Uily " blok " for s "stake," and became the sub. jeot of our cat versation. "Dont on n think we could ' nai' him as he' comes tt of the ' lush dram?'" asked Folkstone. "I'll bet ry life he hs a good ' stake' on him; perhaps he's Wen selHing % lot of cattle, and if o, he's wort tr US for. Let's take a granny' at what he's ' lushing.'" After waittig for some time in vain for tl0e old hmer to come away, and ntidieng that' hehad pratted" himself for a "sticker" against a tarrel, lksitone said:  ,'I weih we had Mary Ann here; hee ' kid' him rat, and perhaps' nall' him too. Suppose we go over aSi get her t"o The place he'agreed to meet Mary Ann was at the Vaults near the shambles, a great "meet" for the ,S3dng up "molls" and their " bludgets ;" but at *   early hour of the evening, none but "square:' pople used it. Whie in drnkling a " ihtnt," the Qaor opened, and Mary Ann looked in. We " offlced" lm her to enter, and called for another " shant.,. While taking this, Folkstone told her Of the "gift" we Uad left in Benny Giles's, and she, willing to- show what she could do, volunteered to " kid" him out, ad after " lumbering" him, pull his bag away. All ^a assistance required of us was only to -enter thb lanmage-way when she " officed" to us, and block up the entrance if the old fellow " beefed," so as to give br time to make a sure " get away." After arranging these matters, in- she went to the ' lush drum," under pretence of purchasing a " shant." Ws " piped her off," and saw the ogling she slung the usplodger," while he, admiringly, bandled the neck- ie of the flying Mary Ann, giving her an opportunity "I onuna', whioh '" iok, hehad ha-as nugar;, in. 4' Bla my hjes if ihe aint a saucy little Jade," cried Ipllktone, ma ho rtatneudiy eyea hoittiile 4 kiker up at graft.'

Mary Ann seeing she couldn't well ease the old t bloke" in the " lush drnm" without being " tumbled Ui" behind the bar, "kidied" the now "ready'd ,plodger" outeide, who, after a word or two from the ^ moll," followed her like a lamb, acroes' the way and p an entry-belonging to the Free Market Hotel. Mary Ann led the way, followed eagerly by the old codger, aoon he was out of sight along with her, while we, witing the " offce" from Mary Ann, Btood at the en- I??, ready to bar the way ia case of a " tumble,."

This met with approval from Polkstone, who: was longitg to get: out of Yorashire, the'mor'eo, tor that his intended Judy,.

He had :ust re- turned from York, where he and. hia ' mob" ,ad met Joe, and from him I heard that our ", pal"'intended leavingtor Leeds in the next morning train. This was good news, and after purchMftg what we wanted we determined -to wait for Joe, or at least until the train ia whbih he as expected' to come, ihould arrive. Oar bank we# in anything but 'a satistaotory condition, considering the time we had been away from home, and the " graft'-we had done; and that night, while sittiDg in the parlor of a " square lush drum," Folk. ,tone and I began reviewing the profits and lons of wI at we had done. We had the room to ourselves, aud were without fear of an ' earwig." Folkstone felt somewhat " down on it," perhaps from being so   I1 leog away from London, ad ftom the lose of his Mary Amni, or it might be other causes, but "down*'i he was ; and I for myself, I felt rather nclined jeat then to philosophize upon the actual state of thl0og in their being upon us, not only "a thieves but as men.

I  his I ad to try him, for ff he didn't mean ,ay- M4g on the : "squre," of course what,l said would apOly to our then predicament, regarding our share of the "stuff" we had "cracked" for, After another pause, he stuck his two hands deep into hu trousers pockets, and at the same time, stretching his legs to the fau length, ie laid, more u it to himelf : "No, sir, it aint a winning game, and I have a good mind to play it no more. My God! ust look what a follow has to suffer after all, Now, I'll tell you something, ' chum.' Before I met you'and Joe at the turrey Circus, I had made up my mind to take a ' ran' or two for the purpose of enabling me to ' square my gills' in another land,.and if I sucoeedd in ' touobinrg' enongh, to take me away and plaoo me where I could earn a square living, that was all I desired, and had I returned to the ' start' immediately after I got my share of the ' poke' I ' nailed' on the jonrney down heeo, that, along with what I had by me, would havo carried me through.

We took an- other " shant" together, after which we left the " lhu drum" and slowly sauntered towards tho "molla' crib," where, in order to keep them from " tumbling" to our future Intions, we aent out for the "max,"  and tried to appear as formerly. We slept thero that night, more for safety tnza choice, and when the mornbg broke in, Polkstone and I arose and got ourselves in time for our contemplated journey, intending to leave Leeds whether Joe re. turned or not.

Here Joe rented a mall cottage that stood on the road-side, and -while the oarpentere were fixing it, Joe went into Leeds and ordered such arnilse as his eisters and himself thought would be sultable for the place-toys, small books, marbles, dolls, songe, and a large assortment of the beat anu- dies,  as Aoon ao thfi j b was filashed, Joe bid good-bye to his relaUton, and off we started for the railway station. We had now a somewhat diofiuht matter to get over; for upon the departure of the Lon- don traina there was a *" fly-eop" stationed there to '" pipe off" any " ross" that might be going that way. Very frequently thin offloe was performed by one of three whon we had, just now, much camee  to fear- 'Jermy Ohilds, Jack SBthbs and  Bob Hartley. So' after "p piping" things "qauare", around the ticket. office, one of us (Polatone) walked up to the oefioe and seoraed three tickets for the " atart," wlkile Joe ad I msaaged to enter the carriages by makig a cik- cult of the station. It was lucky we did so, as immse diately before the signal for stmring was given, our old enemy, Jemmy Ohilds, appeared on the phltform, followed by his aids, stnbbs and Hartley. For the moment we were rather ehakey, suppoeing,they were "on" no, and we were preparing for a rush from the opposite door ofthe oar, when lackily the signal for s tartei was given, and before the *" cops" eouod reaah our oarriage window to " granny" inside, a snort wai given, and oE we flaw on our road once more for Lon- don I Away from Leeds, we felt more comfortable, for we tcuew very well there was a 4" deny" on na, and I that the " wpa't only waited Untfi eaiaoient evidence  .   conid be mustered agasftt m to make a show of a oase and then grab u. Bet now we were all right, an far as " pinhing" in Leeds was oonoerned, and we felt in every way muoh happier. There Was a pretty large number of ,paongers in the o rs ; some for one plae, some for another on the route, and we made up our mhinj  to give all we same aoross the benefit of our proficieacy in "dfpology."' The firat victim we collared was an old lady whbo, after securely tying op itr " aoot-bfg," (retianle) very oarefully stowed it away into a larg0 saddle-bag pocket under her petS!u coats. ,Tiw wis rather a diffioult job for us to manu ge, but the *' ofloeo weae lung" from the one to th. other, sigainfyig that the old lady with doubt oar  rted a " staks.'"AUlbeing ofthoe same mind, it was deterrmid that tie old lady should " blew her pobke." dA she aro  at the station she intended getting out at, one of r  wes to *' front" her ad prevent her leaving the crrikseg util he had left behind her her ddting "soot-bag." Being the nearest to the door, at the lady's request I aroe when the tram stopped at the station, for the purpose of if'orming the conductor there was a lady inside who wished to get out. She aliso got on her feet, and while I spoke to the conucl- tor, asking him-not to open the door for the lady, buta what o'clock it was, and bow far we were from Leed, &o.-my 1" chuma" managed to ease the old lady of her " soeothag." Of course it war impogssble for her to get out while I stood in the way; but immediately after the "Offloo" was given that the "bag was flf.," I called the con- duotor, and the victim wae allowed to "eIlde." In a second or two we were cff agin, and a  we whrled along we made asecreen with our overcoats to "stall ( f"Forkstone, while he ".tuned out the poke." The oontents of the bag turned out to be a " houe-wife," sheers, needles, thiead and thimble; a purse oontains ing nine poeids in gold and a ew shillings; and, care- folly wrapped and folded in several pieces of paper and rage, was a fine gold repeater. o far so good, thought we, but how to get rid f the " suoper" was the next affair; for mspposg us to be " tumbled to" for something we might do, of course we'd be ' frUk- ed" and thoe super" foundon Ol  This would never do, and the trouble thhi gave w prevented us from "grafting" untl we should rid ourslyeal of the watch. At the next tation  we were to atop until another train came  in, and while doing so, Joe showed his usual ingenuity by purchaisg a few cigars and obtank ing an 'empty igar box. This he stuffed with hay, and after seerMy plaing the repeater ihide, put an ad- drees on it, &and takidg It to the paroel's department, booked the paperwrapped cigar box for London.  Sa far so good, agan. Wo knew where the watch won going, and now we were free to " graft" again, ma Sraff" we did with a vengeance; for the train that came in now, wa  filled with exourtionists, who, In crowds, got out hero and migled with those already there.

None answering to this inqairy the cliec- tor, after securing tickets for the return of those who wished to prosecute, gave the signal and again we were on our way for the "start.', This was to be a rather eventful journey,.not only to. those who were traveling on the "t eqae'bu to Vw\jMyfvi 19S!w XW t had arrived at a station about twenty- mie fromin Lon don, and were awaiting the up-coming of another train, nomething being neglected on the part of the ewitoh man, in rushed the coming train, 'nd in a mo. ment after smash went the enginese against each other, and crash went the carriages over the embankeiAx Here was a eight 9--ome with blpody heads and faces struggling to escape from the windowrs of the up-turn- edoarriages, and others crying piteounly for. help, whili women and children soreamed at the highest pitch for succor. We who had fortunately been oa the platform near the ticket.-ofiae. , piping off" for a ".stake," escaped the accident, and the next moment were flying down the bank, and helping to .extricate the unfortunate suffaters from their imperilled condi- tion., While engaged thus, a heavy old "swell," re. gard4ess of the. wounded around him who were striv. Ig to make their escape, pulled young and old away from the window and thrust himself half-way through. There he-stuck, unable to worm his unwieldy caroase out, and at the same time preventing others of a more human shape from receiving assistance. "Pype that meen owd codger," said Joe, pointing to the swell; "I'll be blarsted iv 'e ottent tu ' blew' iz 'stuff' fur is meenniss. 8i thl at 'im 'ow 'e lags 'm aul awaiy froo t' winder let's 'njal' 'im az wi hawl 'im thrue t' winder. 'Ere giva and," and with that the three of us by main force hauled the old, selfisb "swell" out through the carriage window. In doing ep, Folkstone managed to ease him of his " dummry,'   , Which he immediately "anuag' to me, and n a mo- e ment after' the old "bloke't' "ridge thimble', fol- i lowed suit.- This waa in the midst of the confusion 4nd crowd which hid now got togetner. The old fel- t low, as soon as hauled through,' took to hi' heels, and imonbg the rush we lost fight of him. We' next helped the women and ohildren out, and In t Qoing so one, a fat old dowager, came ,quash down on I my patent leather. Heavens t what a Weight seemed t to drop -on me. I roared but' lusily, for I was in an B agony of pan, but Joe and Folkstone laughed at me, supposing I as kidding.,'"Bat there ws no "kid"  bout t; tileo-t oiew lt  9wirtfy r  Vf gp, - who ever even attempted to apologise for the phin ihe wts the mean of me 'eduring.

Here I ly,'of Course pretending my ease to be worse than it was, and in about ten minutel I wu in the midstof crippled and lojared travellers who were carried up here by the railway hands. I pow eagerly looked for my "pals," and soon after saw them approaching where I lay. I then called a waiter belonging to the hotel close by, who was looking on and helping at times, and told him to order a carriage. This was done and I was placed in it, and brought to the hotel.' Here we hired of the owner the carriage a nd driver to take ul to 1th " atft ' atu. I  fetw iMAuUtP ifter off we were driven poat-hamte to London. As goon as we had got fairly started, Joe said: "Iz thau gammonin' or Iz than reeily 'art? I han't mnaid thee eout; wat's up wi' th' ',' I showed Joe and Folkstone my foot, which was now considerably swelled, and then they agreed that twasn,'t " kid,' on my part.

My eyes! how I was astonished at the number and contents, besides which, two hand- some gold ladies' watches were made a 'prZ of.- Once' more in London I Well whether should we go and   at once "fence" what "yaks". we' had i' pinched" or make for the home where we had' lift your better halves. I was strongly inclined to the latter 'bt as Folkstone was in a harry to reach his owr " dram*' where he had something of moment to Attend to, let Jessie slide tor the moment, and the three of us got out near the Elephant and Castle. We settled with the post-chase driver his bonus, the obarge hav- ing been paid at the hotel before starting, and with -the aid of my " cliums," I managed to get into the parlor of the E. and .. After oeliog in a "'hankt' ia-piece, Joe went over the way to where old Bill Dann lived, and fortunately found him at home, but in a " very sickly condition." Re was amoking herka at   the time, "f a owe for the athma. At grat, Bitl eem- ed d  ed to leave the shanty, but upon Joe tolling ida there was a lot of " red skias" waiting for sale, he quieky laid alde his pipe, and followed Joe over to where olkatone and I sat waiting their coming. Poor old Bil X he looked, upon his entrance, s itf hs contractt of this life was about finished. Oth the 1ight of the " ridge" oaaees of stolen watches had a most beneficial effect in re-arimating whatwas left of him, Hie eyes at first coming in, were glawy and firelees. but immeditely on the "supera" being produced and lid before him on the table, for erauination, " a change oame o'er the spirit of his dream," and he immediately beoame the man of budbele. All his facultias aum.- ed their woented vigor; the glassy eye beeame fall of life and darted greedily on the golden spoil; and after the bargain had been concluded, cff he walked with an ehltloity of step beooming a youth of twenty! We had not yet brought to light '* the repeater," but now that we had to wait a few houre for old Bai's return with the " sugar," Joe volunteered to go for the watch, end be in readineas for B41 on his appearance. We had waited about two hours, and Joe had been back ha  t time, when in oame old Bill, complain- ing, as was usual with him, of the difficulties he had to undergo in order raise the " sugar" for ua. This we cared little about. We were accustomed to old Bill's t4l1e of enhaloiwg-or at least trying to-the obliga- tion we were under to him for finding us the fourth pert value of what we broughht hi. However, we were paid what we had agreed upon, and a bottle of wthe was called in over the "fencing." While we were engaged drinking and talking, Joe drew from his "kick" the repeater, under pretenme of seeing the hour. In a moment old Bill's eye was upon it, and, siretaking out his hand for it, he flaked: "What bave you got there, Yorkjy? Lt's have a * twig.' " Joe handed him the gold repeater, Bsoinog: "Nyai, its neowt but a nouwd kettle wat I got gin i Pi Yorkdheer foo my gray y; 'tarn't up tu mutoh; iz it t Bill didn't aower; he waa bry eXaomlaig the val- uable aticle, and when he got through he handed it to Joe, with the remark: "' 2i  an old thing; *tafnt up to much on the crook ;' but I'd buy It for my own wetr; how muh do you ask for it?" Joe was playing with the old "fence," and gave him all the line he wanted , Well, Bill, ouwd lad. seie' as than koaa mooar abowt aitoh thingaur I du, l'd l1ke thee tu tell mi tw muoh t' ouwd thing'a wurth, an 'appen I'll sell ht thee." Bill again took th repeater in his duke,"' by way of further etamining it, but that was not required, his experienced "os:e" had altready " weghoed up" the proper value of the "muper f" then, after a summary of imaginauy deeots, he puahed the gold repeater from him, Rltng:   "WeB, Yoby, ass I sfd before, 'laint up to much on the ' croak;' the Oae the only thibg. about it that apq be I turned into aythiag ;' the wolka is of no aoount until they te fixed, and -that would ost a good bit; but, eeing it7' you, I don't mind giving- I give you fe ' quids' for the thing-there " and old Bill rwose as if in a hurry to be off, but not heo- ing Joe make answer to he cfftr, he lingered a' - he end of the table, pretending to be busy adjustig hb neck-tie and toggery, etc. "Duzaent 'a wish thou maiy get it-five ' quids?'

When old Bill saw that Joe waa in earnest, and that he had beea "ounding" him all the time, he felt rather hee-pist' for the moment, but, quickly recovering himself, he said, with a business laugh; : "Why, b 0rky,  do you think I didn't" tnible' to your racketP Oh, yes, I had you from the very first, but I thought I'd let you slide, but without ' kid. ; How much do you want for the repeater?

Wat's thau du?" Old Bill again took a " granny*' at the watch, and after a little consideration " collared" the " ridge- thimble," and tabled the " sugar" for it. A short time after, when the " regtari" were put round, we parted from Folktone, and proceeded on our way to our home. Poor Jessie I I hadn't seen her for near three months. She must wonder what had become of me I Perhaps she thought me "logged," or at least "doing" a heavy " bat of stir," how I'd surprise her upon entering I And Joe's " moll," I wonder how she has behaved to her aince my departure f I knew that before I left they were not " nats" on each other. I 'wonder how they've got along together! Such were my thoughts as I and Joe made our way towards home. As we left the main road and turned into the sreet where our home lay, I cast my eyes toward the win dows of the house, and there I saw my darling Jeere in the act of feeding a favorite thrush that I had bought her, for she was very fond of birds and flowers BRor head was turned from me, and auotioed we supped into th e p way. I was a few steps ahead of Joe, and in a second or two I bouno-d into the room, and I bad my darling in my ams. 'We were In the midst of our embrmoe when Joe, who had been tryig hia room   door, entered; he looked rather disappointed at not finding his little " wire" where he had left her, ai noticing us in each other's emabiae, he stood with the knob of the door in his hand saying, asl a twinkle, lit up his eye: "Aye, that's t' waly tu du it-.gtv Os annuthur--n' ' sng' wn in far min wyle thau's at it, far I'll g'oa tu thundur iv theeir's anny far mi i' nixt doar. Weeir'e mi las, dbz thau knoaw, Jeseey 1" and throwing down his oarpet-bag, he drew in a chair and eat down. Jessie seemed unwilling to answer, and " stalled-off' Joe's question by going to the eupboard, and taking the bottle from it, left the room, but not before" cffi cing" me that she wanted to speak with me outide. I made an excuse to Joe, and soon after followed her. "' Oh, mi guidnefs, what Iwor wul I say ite 'imn  She's gone awa frae beer this month an' maire, an' whart he's gane tu I'm shair I canna tell, for asirty; bit I think she's among them set at the Beeven, Djals,' sald Joesie to me in the passage.

I told him that she had been one a good tiie, but did not hint all I knew from Jeasie; but seeing that my ' chum" was in a strait, I volunteered to accompany him to the Dials in quest of bS delionqent partner.

Joe war waiting, 8o, promising to return in two or three hours, I hurried off with Joe to the Seveh Dila On the way, while walking along, Joe seemed some- what distressed and said but little. I divined the cause of this, and in order to break him In for the woret (for I believedis little " mothtool" had deserted him) I began by Jocularly bandying him about his " molls" flight to her old neighborhood and former " pals." He took it in good part, yet I could see that he felt there wa a, possibility of her having again (" palled4-n" with the Dialonions. After walking a while in denoe, he suddenly asked : "Wat's thau think on't, * chum'? Dos tham think 't Uttili 'I(e wad ' turn ai up* i* this wiy, atur mi cooin' sut I cu'd tu keeip ur froo throwt*' a chans8 awaiy, an' 'appen ' kolloril' a ' laggin', eh?" I thought it quite possible, for I had seen so much in- contintnoe among the " molls of the cross," that I, for one; had little or no faith in them. I had seen those among them who professed the wildet love for their ' blokes ;" who praised them in their abenoe,nd aaap- peared to dot, upan them when present--"' bloke" who took a delight in dressing their lady loves In gatr meats of the ootdieat description, who furmined houses for them in a style to equal palsoeg, and yet those same love-virtuoao' "molls of the crosa" secered  to themselves sleeping partners on the first night of their "bloke's" incarceration in "limbo."  It was common enough, and Joo knew it, but he didn't wish to believe it in his oae, neither did I want to foroe hhm to it. I knew that he liked her, and that above all the " molls" he had mixed among, while I waS with him; but the idea of her having  paUed- in" with an. other "bloke," seemed to out Joe to the quick, and at times whiU wr     along he would say as if talling to himself.: s"Wy I oolrly shoo amsn't ' turned ml up' lyke this I I nivvir did eonurt to ur as u'ad maik ur ' nammas' froo ml i' this fahhshin, but the-fra summut up I kaoa, elas , i* til 'uzzy wudn't bea awaey froo 'ome ; but iv shoo has ' turned mi up' for sum uthur ' bloke,' 111 go t(o b- iv their woiynt bea fan 1' t' 'ouse.

Of course, Duffy was unaware, who were the, occupants of the box previous to his entering, else he would have taken the "judy" around to where we now stood, but so it was, and there Athey were. A cold salute from Duffy greated Riley, as hM (Duffy) strove to find her standing-room near. the bar, and in doing so accidenWtaly toppled the gin glass over, spilling the." max" and breakit the, glass. ^This provoked a volley of abuse, frqm Riley, while Duffy stood and looked down on his rabuser, somewhat as aNewfoundlaxd does at a snarly turmspit.           ' "Let's 'ave a quartern o' port wine, landlord," said Duffy, as he proudly throw down a half a crown, ahd if this thingamajig (pointing to Riley) don't want to pay for the glass, I will."

' "]Bimd mel if .didn't 'ave quite a job in 'getting her along; for you see, she's a flimy' little piece and S easily 'tumbled,' and she kept asking me what I o wanted with her, taking her from ' graft,' and away, : from two other ' molls,' who were stalling for her. d Well, sir, how do you think succeeded in kidding'her s all t  he way fro.  Pantheon down to here? I'll tell you. You see, in ho first place, I took a walk away ' up Oxford street, from the bottom to the top, and was I returning when I saw a ' mob' of' molls' at ' graft, I near theResnt e Orqug3. WO, I w}} altd until I saw i them- got the 'poko'off, and followed them into a I "lush",drum,' whoro they went to turn out tho 'skin.' J ,I dropt in ,at tho right time, Mir, and' collared my i max.' Well, after a second'lush,' at which I'stood. 3in,' of course, I asked Charley MadDonald's 'moll' rwhether, she had seen the little ' moll' I was after. Yes, she had seen her as she was going int6 the Pan- [ theon. .his was qnough, so, 'collaring' another ' stiffener'-for you see the molls' lot old Duff do as he likes when theo lush' is on the bord--out I rushed, and off for the Pantheon. HHere I had to stay for about an hour, piping off' the I gigger,' for you see tI couldn't attempt to go inside, my ' toggery' 1i so thlarsted seedy, but there I waited, and at last t saw my little 'judy' hurrying out and making for a 'lush drum.' It was as I expected, the ' bag was off,' and here I again stdod in for a double shant.' Well, after a little manoouvring t managed to ' collar' her ' oglo' I and ' officed' to her, but she wouldn't ' cop' at first, thinking, I suppose, that I was on the ' whisper ; but I kept on, and presently she slid beside me, and clip- ped a ' deenir' into my ' dukeo.' Of course, I told her that wasn't my gamn just then, and that I was on special business; 'but seeing it was she, I thought it Iwould look out of place to refuse and return the 'deenir.' So 'I slung' it :down on the counter and, called for a half-pint of gin, and while 'lushing' that 1 wlispered to her, that I knew a ' bloke' who had a lot of beautif[i silks'and shawls for sale on the I crook,." and that if she was willing I would' take her and show them to her'; but as the *'bloke' di4n't want it gener- ally known, it wouldn't do to bring the other ' molls' 'along. Tlhsa succeeded, an4 off we started for' the Crown'.

It was evening, and I was once more withmy Jessie, tnelig her of our adventures in Yorkshire, including  the heart breaking I underwent in being parted from her so long, and what I suffered in not being able to inform her how I was situated-how I thought that 1 she might believe me dead,' or gone'from hier for ever, and perhaps make up her mind to take some other to love; and how I!ongEd to be released before she would thus make me miserable for eve'r-when she ratd, in offended astonishment: "C Guid Lord I I'm shait ye neednae a bawthircd yersol sae muckle aboot that, Sixtie daiys iz no sae tias; jist look at oor Watte, he's bin ' up-bye' twfa'r three times an' thocht noething o' t' an' dun 6 sixtie,' cilki trip 1 What! did ye think I'd gang aws' wi' that limmor ben there oos, yo ocht na'; I'm shair she's no mucklo o' a pattrin for ony yin.

From Jessie's acount I earned that soon after our departure for LeOds, the "moll-wire;" being without the'restraintof Joe's pre- sence, indulged in those pleasures to which she was ceustormed before " palllig-in! wtth Joe,' and also tried to induce Jessie 'to aompany her to theatres, wine-rooms, and onsort hailS-not that she anued Jessis 010 ompany on these oeiow, bUt as a saf; guard againt hber 'ations being * nosed" to Joe upon his return; but she faled un -cryiigher point Pnt the Bdotoh Is"8 and beoauee of that J s63l bad to -sufeor many inultsafthm the Olkbyey" w4ir "' From a I herd, I oonoloded tht the W lttoi " we juo"   Jv         . . . was .ufiithful to her itege lorsmy chum, Joe-nd oonsequently unfit to associate with myhalf-fiedgod aSoot lassie.
