She started up in bed, rubbing her eyes and looking around, almost frightened at the stillness to which she was not accustomed. At first she could scarcely think where she was, everything looked so strange. Hardly once since she could remember had she waked  of a morning anywhere but in the little ante- room which opened from her papa's bed-cham- ber. When shefirst opened her eyes she had always seen the green velvet paper on the walls, the green and gilt curtain at the long, low win- dow, the hanging bookshelves, the bureau for her clothes, with a swinging glass upon it, the   8       FALSE SHAME. few brightly colored pictures in gilt frames, her low rocking-chair; and in the corner by the window the baby-house, which was quite as tall as the bureau, and cost twice as much money. Then she always heard, besides the perpetual rattle and whirl from the street, an incessant noise in the house: doors opening and shut- ting, bells ringing, people running about the halls and up and down the stairs, which were only the other side of the partition from her bed, voices talking and shouting; those sounds which one always hears in the hotel of a great city. And, also, she heard an occasional slight rat- tling and stepping about in her papa's room, which she knew meant that he was dressing for breakfast. But this morning she found herself in a low room, painted blue, and filled with quaint, old- fashioned furniture. The roof sloped almost to the floor at the side, and the two windows were, together, much smaller than the single one of her room in the city. The white cotton curtains, which were trimmed with netted fringe, were looped up, and Eliza- beth could see through one window a row of   FALSE SHAME.     ,  9 turkeys roosting on a branch of the elm-tree out- side, looking, with their heads tucked under their wings, like so many clumsy bundles of speckled feathers. Lifting her head, she could see from the other window a long stretch of brown, and a hill cov- ered with evergreen trees. Above this hill the clouds were beginning to brighten into scarlet and gold, in token that the sun was near at hand, as couriers go before to announce with  great pomp and pageantry the coming of a king. These brilliant clouds made a far handsomer window hanging than the one in Elizabeth's old room, being even brighter than the colors in her new Roman scarf. Listening, she only heard a:solitary cow low- ing, the cocks answering each other near and far away- from farm-yard to farm-yard, and Christo- pher whistling and drumming on a tin milk-pail on his way to the cow-shed. It was very certain she was no longer in Bos- ton; and directly she remembered the delight- ful bustle, in packing her trunk and getting ready for the journey, the sight of her father in his new uniform, the parade of soldiers on the   10      FALSE SHAME. Common, and after that the long, tiresome ride in the cars and in the coach with Aunt Rachel, and their coming to Tillington after dark, where Christopher was waiting to take them the last mile home in a chaise. At that time she was too tired and sleepy to notice anything; she was glad to go directly to bed. While she was thinking of these things, she heard somebody stepping around in the room ' below, and a great deal of rattling about the stove. The pipe of the stove came up through a hole in the floor, warming her room before it went into the chimney, so she could hear the sounds from below very plainly. There was a rumbling noise, like some heavy furniture moved across the floor, which was in fact the table drawn out for breakfast. Then she heard the clatter of plates and knives, the sizzling and sputtering of something cooking upon the stove, and occasion- ally people's voices. "I had a wretched night, but no worse than I expected. You know I can never sleep with anything on my mind, said one. "Don't you suppose if you should try a cup   FALSE SHAME.        " of pennyroyal tea, taken pretty hot just before you go to bed, it might kind of quiet down your nerves and help you to sleep better?" suggested another voice. "Now that is just like you, Sister Rachell When I have been worried and fretted half out of my senses you go and suggest some simple old-wives' drink, as though that would touch my case. But then it is only what I expected. I never did find any sympathy in my own familyi" replied the first voice. "The servants, probably, preparing break- fast," thought Elizabeth, who had never sus- pected, simple little soul, that it could be possi- ble for a family to exist without servants, l excepting it might be the very lowest, poorest class, such as street beggars. And I am afraid she had not thought much about the poverty and distress of even these forlorn creatures. Very soon there was a step on the stairs, and then Aunt Rachel's motherly face looked in, and she said, in a voice as cheerful as a robin's in early -summer mornings, "It is time to get up now, dear, breakfast will be ready very soon." Then coming to the bedside, she kissed Eliza-   12      FALSE SHAME. beth so tenderly that the little girl almost felt as though her mamma, who died so many, many years ago, had come back again. Her heart warmed up toward Aunt Rachel, and she felt very happy as she watched her lay- ing out the stoutest dress and thickest pair of shoes from her trunk; but she tried not to show any feeling in her face, having a way of consid- ering any such weakness as something to be ashamed of. This was very silly, I know; but Elizabeth had lived for so long at a hotel, with no mam- ma to look after her, that she had a great many silly notions in her small head; and it was a very good thing for her when, the firm whose cashier he was having failed, her papa decided to join the army and send Elizabeth to live with his aunts, Mrs. Rachel Harrington and Miss Rebekah Willoughby, in the country. So, for one little girl at least, this cruel, terrible war was a very good thing.   FALSE SHAME.      13 CHAPTER II. THE WILLOUGHBY HOUSE. WHEN Elizabeth had dressed herself and looked around, she found everything about the house as new and strange to her as though she had waked in Japan or Hindostan; and I think it would have seemed very queer to anybody, even one who had always lived in a country farm-house, for this was the very oldest house in Tillington. It stood quite by itself on a high hill, and was an old, old house before Miss Rebekah and Mrs. Rachel were born. Indeed, so far as the most aged people in town could remember, those even who could no longer see, and hear, and walk, having used their bodies until they were almost worn out, the old Willoughby House had always stood on Willoughby Hill and looked old-fash- ioned and weather-stained. Of course it had not; and when we think of the ancient English castles, and the still more ancient palaces and temples of Egypt and Italy,     ki   "      FALSE SHAME. nothing seemed so very old here in New En- gland, where, less than three hundred years ago, there were no houses but wigwams. And the Willoughby House was not built for years after the Mayflower had brought to Ply- mouth Rock. the hundred and one souls who have since become a nation. The early settlers did not immediately creep away from the sand which bounds the coast where they landed and first made themselves a home, back to the more fertile soil on the banks of the rivers. Gradually, however, the place becoming too strait for them, the people spread themselves further around, and the forest was dotted over with settlements which grew to be the thriving, pleasant towns and cities where we now live. When our great-grandfathers were small boys, and our great-grandmothers were little girls in linsey-woolsey gowns, the Willoughby House was, part of it, tall trees, where the squirrels ate nuts and the forest-birds builded -their nests. But their came a day when the trees, having become sturdy and large, by help of the sun,   FALSE SHAME.       15 and rain, and wind of a century or so, were counted worthy to make a home for something of more value than all the wild creatures of the wood; and so they were cut and shaped and hewed with axes and saws into boards and beams and rafters. This took a deal of hard labor, for there were not then saw-mills on every brook. O no! nor for many and many a mile around, so people were obliged to do the best they could without. The walls of the house were built of stone, brought by two men on a hand-barrow, which was a kind of wooden tray with handles, as far as across Boston Common from the State- house to the deer park. Thus you see it must have been a long time in building; but when it was done, there was not another so grand a house within a hundred miles. Here the Willoughbys lived, fathers and sons. Here the children played and worked, and grew to be men and women, then went away into the world, until at last, worn and old, they died, and their bodies turned to dust. But the soul, that part of them which thought and felt, that which was really thmselves, is not   16       FALSE SHA M,. dead, but is somewhere still, thinking and feeling. The Willoughby House passed from father to son down the family line until at last, of all the brothers and sisters, there was only left in. it these two, Mrs. Rachel and Miss Rebekah, and now their grand-niece, Flizabeth. ,t.   FALSE SHAME.       17 CHAPTER III. MRS. RACHEL AND MSS REBEKAH. A merry heart doeth good like a medicine; but a broken spirit drieth the bones.- SOLOMON. WHEN Elizabeth opened the door at the foot of the chamber stairs, it led, greatly to her sur- prise, directly into the kitchen; the room from where all the sizzling, and rattling, and talking had come. There stood Aunt Rachel in her chocolate- colored calico dress and blue checked apron, turning some slices of ham in a spider on the stove. The teakettle was humming cheerfully to itself; the teapot was hopping up and down as though it were too happy to stand still; and just behind the stove, on the wide stone hearth, lay a white cat, purring loudly, and watching two black kittens playing and tumbling over her and each other. The sun, which was now fairly above the evergreen-covered hill, shone in this kitchen, making the pans turned to dry   18      FALSE SHAME. on a swing-table glitter like silver. It just touched Aunt Rachel's hair, which was partly golden and partly gray, and made it look like a radiant crown. The sunbeams lighted up everything in the cheerful kitchen, excepting Miss Rebekah, and nothing could brighten her. She sat in a straight-backed wooden chair, stuffed and cov- ered with scarlet broadcloth, looking intently at every motion Mrs. Rachel made, as it seemed, for the only purpose of finding fault. "There, there, Sister Rachel, don't let the fat spatter on the stove," she was saying when Elizabeth opened the chamber door. In a moment she turned her head. "Come in, child; don't you know better than to keep the door open, bringing in the cold air, and letting the smell of the cooking all over the house " said she sharply. '( These annoyances are just what I made up my mind to expect though, Sister Rachel, when you consented to take the burden of a child; but it is no mat- ter how I feel if you are satisfied," she contin- ued, addressing her sister. Mrs. Rachel and Miss Rebekah were twins,   FALSE SHAME.       19 and when they were children they looked so nearly alike that even their own family could hardly tell them apart, only as Miss Rebekah always wore a necklace of gold beads to dis- tinguish her. But the girls were very different in charac- ter; and as the years went on and found one always fretting and scowling, and the other al- ways smiling and ready to find the very best in everything, they made cross, unpleasant lines and marks in Miss Rebekah's face, while Ra- chel's grew sweeter and happier all the time. So when they were women one could hardly see that they looked in the least alike. Mrs. Rachel's mind-was always filled with agreeable, pleasant thoughts, which seemed to make a cheerful atmosphere around her, as you have seen on a September morning a silvery line of mist rising from a brook and hanging over it. 'Within this cheerful atmosphere she kept herself, and did not -allow Miss Rebekah's fretfulness to disturb her tranquillity in the least. So all this time she did not notice what her sister was talking about; and, although she  2   20       FALSE SHAME. heard her voice, it affected her no more than the purr of the cat or the simmering of the kettle. The sound of the opening door was lost in the louder noise of the meat in the spider, and Mrs. Rachel did not know Elizabeth had come in until she stood close beside her, attracted by the sight of the kittens. "O here comes our little Robin Redbreast I ' said she in a hearty tone, which drove away in a minute all the disagreeable feeling Miss Re- bekah's looks and words had stirred up. I do not see, for my part, how Miss Rebekah had managed to keep so much ill nature in her heart during all these years, with such a good- natured example right before her eyes. I should have supposed it would have all thawed away before the sun of Mrs. Rachel's cheerfulness. But it had not, that was evident; and if she struggled some to overcome her unhappy selfish temper, she did not struggle hard enough. It is certain that if we are not getting the better of a bad habit, the bad habit is getting the better of us; so Miss Rebekah had been every year more and more confirmed in her way of fretting and   FALSE SHAME.       21 finding fault, and thinking only of her own com- fort, which was a great misfortune to her, and a sin in the sight of God. "You may have one" of these kittens for yours, Elizabeth, if you like, and take your choice between them," said Mrs. Rachel. Elizabeth's eyes grew bright with pleasure, for she had never had a live pet in her life. She thought a kitten must be a nicer plaything than a whole baby-house of dolls, as indeed it is. c"I think I will choose the one with a white tail and white face; and only see, Aunt Rachel, the black is parted off above -her eyes just as ladies part and comb off their hair I Isn't that cunning 8 " she exclaimed. Then she took up the kitten. "O you little darling! -Now I must name you something. O I know! I will call you Arbutus. - That is one of the names in my new book; isn't it nice "' "There, there, child; we shall have cat-hairs in our breakfast if you flourish the kitten that way about the table," said Miss Rebekah. There was, indeed, some danger; and it was well for the breakfast that it was now ready.   22      FAT4SF SHAME. CHAPTER IV. CHRISTOPHER. "Now, my dear, you may step to the shed door and call Christopher. You will see him there sawing wood," said Mrs. Rachel when she had put the meat on a great blue platter, and placed the eggs around it like a border of giant pearl beads. Elizabeth's pretty pink and white face drew up into a frown at hearing this simple request, which one would suppose she would have been glad to run and comply with. But no; she thought it a. serious affair to call a strange boy to breakfast, and besides, she had no idea which- of the seven doors might be the shed door, and was ashamed to ask. She was ashamed of ignorance which in that case was no sin; but not ashamed of a cross scowl, which is always wrong. Mrs. Rachel was taking the potatoes from the oven, so she did not see the look of displeasure;   FALSE SHAME.       23 and before she had time to wonder why Eliza- beth did not go, there was no need, for Christo- pher, having finished his wood, came in without being called. Christopher was the boy who milked the cows, took care of the horse, sawed and brought in the wood, and did errands for Mrs. Rachel and Miss Rebekah. He wore a blue woolen frock, tied down around his waist with a red tippet, and looked so unlike any boy of her ac- quaintance, and so comical with his short, white hair, that Elizabeth looked at him as though he had been a monkey or anything else on show. He had, also, a great curiosity to look at her; and being quite bashful, peeped out from under his white eyebrows in a very odd way. But he looked still more comical as he exchanged his frock for a coat which hung behind the door on a peg. He drew the frock off over his head; and as soon as his round, light gray eyes ap- peared below it, they were turned directly upon Elizabeth, looking so funny that she laughed out, quite to his embarrassment. When Miss Rebekah rose to go to the table Elizabeth discovered she was slightly lame, so   24      FALSE STAMS. that she helped herself by a chair; and she had some difficulty, also, in using her hands about cutting her meat. This was caused by a rheu- matic affection, which, doubtless, would have been better for exercise; but she fancied she was made unable to stir much by it, and so required a deal of attention and waiting upon. "I thought you knew, Sister Rachel, that I could never abide to eat off this plate, it brings poor Aunt Ann so plainly before my mind; and it does seem to me you might remember my feelings, and take a little pains to spare them. But then I suppose it is too much to expect anybody will put themselves out to think of me," she sighed, after being nicely arranged with a cushion in her chair and a warm brick to put her feet on. "Sure enough, sure enough, Rebekah ; how careless I am!" answered Mrs. Rachel, as bright and cheerful as the sunlight, taking away the offending plate, and putting upon another the largest egg and nicest potato and slice of meat for her. The breakfast dishes all looked odd to Eliza- beth, who had never seen any colored ware used   FALSE SHAME.       25 upon a table before; but the particular plate which so offended Miss Rebekah's taste was not, so far as she could see, very much unlike the others. It was, like them, of blue and white, and had for devices upon it a border of morn- ing-glories, and in the center a youth playing upon a flute to a shepherdess who wore a broad- brimmed hat, adorned with a huge wreath of flowers, and had a crook in her hand. A flock of sheep were feeding around her, and a watch- dog lay at her feet. In the distance one could see a cottage with a grove and a waterfall near it. On the whole Elizabeth admired the picture very much, and thought she should like to draw and paint one like it. As she was deciding in her mind whether she would color the dress of the shepherdess yellow or red, Christopher was slily peeping at her from over the top of his mug of water, and thinking that, in spite of her bright mering dress and long curls, she didn't look vastly different from country girls after all, if she was from the city. The table, as well as most of the other furni- ture in the Willoughby House, had belonged to I'   26      FALSE SHAME. the dead and gone generation, and this partic- ular plate had been one of a set owned by an "aunt of Miss Rebekah and Mrs. Rachel; an- aunt who, for years before her death, had been partially insane; and Miss Rebekah had some- how " taken a spleen," as she expressed herself, against it on that account, and thought eating from it destroyed all enjoyment of the food. Mrs. Rachel was not one of those uncomfort- able persons who are bent on continually at- tempting to reform the world and bring every- body to believe and behave just according to their notions of right and wrong. Instead, she went on quietly trying to make her own exam- ple faultless as possible; and, I have no doubt, really did a great deal more to influence others than if she had been constantly talking and correcting them, So now she said nothing about the whim of her sister in the matter of the plate,. but tried to divert her thoughts, and make the meal pleasant for the children and herself by talking on something else. "Yes, Sister Rebekah, you ought to tell Elizabeth about Aunt Ann's coming to our   FALSE SHAME. *7 party in Uncle Asaph's shop room. You can set off a story so much better than I can. You always had a gift that way, you know, in your young days," said she, helping herself to a potato. This was very true; Miss Rebekah could make a story very interesting; and, indeed, was in every respect an agreeable companion when- ever she could be induced to forget herself, and what she fancied was due to her. Being warmed up by a cup of crust coffee, appeased by her sister's attentions, and, as I think, infected somewhat with her good-nature, she smiled a little, as at the stirring of some I old memory, and began the story.   28       FALSE SHAME. CHAPTER V. THE UNINVITED GUEST. ' AUNT ANN was your pa's great-aunt, and she hadn't the use of her reason," began Miss Rebekah. Then seeing a look of wonder on Elizabeth's face, Mrs. Rachel added, "Crazy, you know." Miss Rebekah turned upon her. "No, sis- ter, I do not mean to say that. Aunt Ann was not quite in her right mind; but I don't con- sider she was decidedly insane by any manner of means." 4"Sure enough, you are correct about it; but I thought perhaps Elizabeth would understand that term better. However, that is neither here nor there, so go on with your story." Miss Rebekah condescended to drop her re- sentment and proceeded. "Aunt Ann used to wander about from house to house, just as she pleased, among her rela- tions, here at my father's among the rest. She   FALSE SHAME.       29 was full of mischief as a monkey, and crafty as an old fox. She always liked to make a mystery and secret of everyrthing, and was a great one to be forever trying to' come up' with anybody who she imagined had not treated her quite right in some way." Here Miss Rebekah's eyes glistened with en- joyment at the recollection of the old tricks and jokes she had in the gone-by years played upon poor crazy Aunt Ann. Elizabeth and Christo- pher forgot to eat for a minute, from their inter- est in the expected story, and Mrs. Rachel stirred her coffee with a look of entire satisfac- tion. "The time at Uncle Asaph's, Sister Rachel refers to, was when I was quite a young miss, long enough before I went South to teach," con- tinued Miss Rebekah, who dated everything from her half dozen years of southern life, as the lussulmans date everything from the time of Mohammed's flight from Mecca to Medina, which they call "The Grand Hejira." "Aunt Submit-- she was Uncle Asaph's wife, as I suppose you don't know-made a quilting one day, and in- vited all the girls from far and near to come to   30      FALSE SHA ME. it; and so in the evening all the young men hereabouts were to come in and have a good time, playing plays and the like. So the girls hurried and got off the quilt in good season, and* then were ready to enjoy themselves out in the shop-room. Uncle Asaph's folks had been par- ticular to keep it away from Aunt Ann, because she was always such a teaze and plague at such a place. She would notice every little thing which was said or done, and remember it to tell of and laugh about forever after. So the girls kept all signs of preparation for the quilting out of sight when Aunt Ann happened in, and thought they had been too sly for her that time. But that was about an impossibility, The more secret anything was kept, the more pos- sessed she was to find it out; and being about so much, she managed to know almost every- thing that was going on. "The broom-shop was a great room with a bed in one corner, where the hired man slept. People didn't use to think in those days that a bed spoiled a room for everything but a sleep- ing-place, and it was very fashionable to have one even in the parlor. The shop wasn't fin-   FALSE SHAME.      31 ished off much, and overhead was all loose boards. "So when the company of young folks were in the midst of a game of drop the handkerchief, pretty lively and gay, what should happen, but first they knew, Aunt Ann quietly moved away a board up above and dropped down all of a sudden on to the bed, right in their midst." Miss Rebekah laughed so much when her story reached this point that she was obliged to stop talking, and Mrs. Rachel laughed till she cried, for they both remembered so well the flurry this unexpected addition to their number put the young people into. How the girls screamed at first, and then laughed and made the best of it, seeing Aunt Ann had found them out; how Aunt Ann enjoyed to the end of her life the childish joke she had played upon. her young nephews and nieces, and what a wild sparkle of delight came into her crazy eyes whenever she thought of it. Mrs. Rachel laughed till she cried, then wip- ing away thetears, said, "Poor Aunt Ann I If she had only had the right use of her reason what a different life she would have lived I il   32      FALSE SHAME.   I really think nothing can happen to a person which is so great a misfortune as to go insane; and I am sure we can hardly be thankful enough to the Lord for preserving us from it." Elizabeth drew a long breath. "How many things there are that it is necessary to be thank- ful for!" said she, as though quite borne down- with the burden of this duty. "Well I am sure I don't know how a person can help feeling to thank the good Lord for one thing or another every hour of one's life, and it is a real pleasure to do it. It is not irksome to let your father know, when he has brought you a new book or something pretty, that you are made happy by it, and that you love him more for taking pains to buy it for you, is it " Flizabeth looked upon her plate and mumbled a little out of one corner of her mouth, which was another of her bad habits. The fact was she was sadly inclined to sup- pose it would look silly for a tall girl like her to appear pleased with presents, and she usually tried not to show anything of the kind, only she could not very well prevent her face from glow- ing and brightening with delight sometimes,     FALSE STTAM1E.      35 which satisfied her papa entirely without a word. Neither had she learned to be grateful to God for any of the favors of his hand. But if Mrs. Rachel's moral was lost, Miss Rebekah's story, simple as it was, had done good in two ways. For one thing the telling of it had diverted her from thinking of herself for a time, and so left her quite cheerful; and for an- other it had given her an attraction in the eyes of Elizabeth, who, like every child, was very fond of stories, and therefore she looked upon her aunt with more interest and respect than she would otherwise have done. When it was quite finished, Mrs. Rachel brought from the broad stone shelf behind the stove-pipe, where it had been warming, a pumpkin-pie in a deep, square tin plate. It looked remarkably nice to Elizabeth, who particularly liked pumpkin-pie; but will you believe a little girl was ever so silly as to refuse a piece of pie just because she had never been accustomed to see it upon a breakfast- table, and did not consider it a suitable dish  "No I thank you, I do not wish for any," said she very decidedly. But there came act-   86       FALSE SHAME. ually a scowl upon her face when she saw Chri topher helped to a large corner piece, and eat with evident satisfaction. She was not very long in getting over th foolish notion, however, and learned in time th what custom has made seem quite absurd in son places may be perfectly proper in others.   FALSE SHAME.      37 CHAPTER   VI. AUNT CYNTHA'S GHOST. CHRISTOPHER was a pleasant, good-natured boy, and when Flizabeth became accustomed to his odd ways she found him quite an agree- able companion, and it was not many days be- fore they became very good friends. One evening, when Miss Rebekah was dozing in her chair and Mrs. Rachel was in the pantry mixing bread for the next day's baking, the children were talking together about the story Miss Rebekah had told them of crazy Aunt Ann. "I suppose the broom-shop was a place where brooms werwe kept for sale," said Elizabeth, who had been wondering over the matter in her own mind. '"What? a store? Did you think it was a store? Why no, of course it wasn't. A shop is a place where things are made, not where they are sold," replied Christopher. 8 !   38     -FALSE SHAME. "Store!" exclaimed Elizabeth scornfully. "'A store is a place where goods are packed away. Godfrey and Nicholson, the firm my papa belongs to, have a very large building for their storage; but it is usually called a ware- house. And the salesrooms are called shops." The children were both right, only one was speaking of Washington-street and the other of Tillington, and each place had a perfect right to its own way. At Paris people do not say either "shop" or store, but "boutiqe " instead, which they pronounce as though it were spelled bootik. Such things are made proper by cus- tom, and of the different fashions one is no bet- ter than the other. Elizabeth did not understand this, however, and she had not yet learned that true politeness and refinement of manner conforms to the habits of the people where one is, and that it is very silly and affected to strain after the manner of some other country or town; But it was not strange that, to a person who had always lived in a city, the manners and customs of a quiet little town like Tillington seemed, many of them, very odd at first.   FALSE SHAME.      39 "But I say I know all about what a broom- shop is, for I have been into Mr. Pollard's a hundred times. It is jolly fun to watch him at work making brooms. You never saw anybody do that, did you?" asked Christopher. "No, of course I never did; but I dare say I could if I had cared to," replied Elizabeth. Her tone was indifferent enough, quite as though, of all things in the world, this was a matter which was of no interest to her. Yet she looked very curiously at Mrs. Rachel's broom, which hung by a stout string from a nail behind the cellar door. She had never thought before how brooms were made, or indeed if they were made at all; but she would by no means ask about it, for she considered it to be very mortifying to admit that she did not know everything. This kind of pride is of the silliest sort, for nobody expects a child of ten to know all which is worth knowing. No indeed! nor the very wisest men in all ages. The more people learn the better they understand what a vast amount there is yet, and will always continue to be, of which they know nothing at all.    40      FALSE SHAMF. This foolishness kept Elizabeth from knowing a great many interesting things which she was ashamed to ask about. However, this time it was not to be so. "Did you never see any brooms made? No, of course you never did. Well, it is worth see- ing," said Mrs. Rachel, bustling out with her bread batter in a great wooden bowl, which she covered nicely and placed to rise on the chim- ney-shelf. "Well, Christopher," she continued, "I need a new broom; suppose you go over to Mr. Pollard's to-morrow and buy me one, and Elizabeth can go along with you and see him work." "Yes'em," replied Christopher with much satisfaction. But as to Elizabeth, instead of the look of delight which one might have expected to see on it, there came a frown upon her face. The corners of her red lips went down, and little wrinkles came in her forehead, wrinkles which, if she did not mind, would come there soon to stay. What do you think   was the matter? "O ," said she to herself, "I can't go with   FALSE SHAME.      41 him  How people would laugh to see me walk- ing with a boy carrying a broom." Just as though people would notice two chil- dren going on a proper errand, and just as though they would care anything about it if they did. And even if somebody had laughed, what harm would that do  But this was one of Elizabeth's silly notions, so she said very decidedly, "Thank you, Aunt Rachel, but I do not wish to see brooms made." Aunt Rachel knew just what made the little girl say so, for she could see into her thoughts as plainly as she could see through oiled paper, and she knew that such false shame was an infinitely greater disgrace than walking along the highway and across the fields with a boy who carried a broom. She did not say so, however, but set out the little round table, which had three funny twisted legs and a white dimity cover with long knotted fringe over the top. She put the bright brass candlestick, the snuffers and their tray, upon it, all shining in the blazing firelight, which spark- led out from the open stove doors, making the candlelight seem faded and dull; then seated   42      FALSE ISHAME. herself comfortably in an old splint-bottomed rocking-chair with her knitting work, prepared to spend the evening. Elizabeth, however,did not feel] happy. She did really wish to see the broom-maker at work, and the more she thought of it the more miser- able she grew. Christopher too felt somehow under a cloud, without quite knowing why; but bringing for- ward some strips of pine board, of which he was fashioning a rude windmill, he soon whittled and whistled the cloud all away so far as he was concerned. On the contrary, his contentment and Mrs. Rachel's placid face aggravated Elizabeth's un- happiness considerably, and she began more and more to feel herself abused, sighing heavily as she moped away the evening in a low wooden chair which had belonged to her great-grand- father in his boyhood. It was a positive relief to her when Miss Re- bekah waked and showed herself to be in not much better humor, for it is great pain for per- sons who are doing wrong to see about them only the good and happy. The very presence   FALSE SHAME.       43 of such ones is a constant reproach to them; and this, I suppose, is a reason why wicked peo- ple, those who have loved sin better than holi- ness, would be wretched in heaven if it were possible for them to go there. "There, there, Christopher.  Don't you know better than to whistle in the house? It goes through my head like a dart. And here you are whittling right on to the clean floor! Boys are good for nothing but to make work, and I wonder, Sister Rachel, you don't see it so," said Miss Rebekah, looking as forlorn and forbidding as -Elizabeth herself. "Christopher why, he is my right-hand man. I could do without one of my fingers bet- ter than I could spare him. You are 'going to clean up your whittling after you get through, aren't you?" said Mrs. Rachel, so cheerfully that her voice sent away all the uncomfortable- ness Miss Rebekah had made, just as the west wind blows away clouds and foggy weather. But Miss Rebekah did not seem freshened up by it. Her head had fallen to one side during her nap, and her neck felt stiff and ached, one foot was numb, asleep as we say, she was not   "      FALSE SHA MkT. yet wide awake, and altogether was in a fretful mood. So she looked about to see what other fault she could find. Of course she was success- ful then; one can always be who is bent on be- ing displeased. "Why do you set the candle so near the stove, Sister Rachel? Don't you see it is melt- ing all down on that side a " said she. "Sure enough I I was busy with my knit- ting and did not notice," replied Mrs. Rachel, moving the table a few inches. "And by the way, Sister Rebekah, I would like to get you to knit the gore of this sock when I come to it, you can shape it so much handsomer than I can; somehow I can't seem to get the hang of that exactly. You remember, don't you, how much Aunt Cynthia used to pride herself on ier skill in shaping socks? But after all I do not know as I think she made them look any nicer than, you do." Presently she added, "Speaking of Aunt Cynthia, you ought to tell the children her ghost story." Miss Rebekah was almost always ready to tell a story; so as the children both looked up ea- gerly, she began without any further urging.   FALSE SHAMFI.       45 "It happened in this very room, several years before I went South," said she. "Aunt Cyn- thia 'was left a widow, and all the last years of her life she lived here with father. Mother died about the time of Aunt Cynthia's husband, Un- cle Warren, so she kept house for father. Well, one evening she sat here alone, knitting away as usual. It was in the fall of the year, and the men were all at the barn husking, and we girls were off at the singing-school. So she sat here by herself, looking at the fire-we didn't have any stove then, but this great fireplace which is bricked up now-and thinking about one thing and another till she dropped off asleep. Sud- denly, as she said, she was started wide awake by a dreadful noise. It set her heart all in a flutter, and she couldn't tell at first what had happened; but presently she heard it again, sounding more horribly than before. She said she felt the cold sweat starting out all over her, and her teeth chattering in her head. She was so startled she couldn't stir hand nor foot. She was always a timorsome soul, and a great be- liever in signs and wonders. She was forever on the lookout for an omen of one sort or anoth- b  .         .   "O      FALSE SHAME. er; and there could not so much as a crow fly over the house but it meant something. So she made up her mind this unearthly sound was sent for a warning sure enough; and she said she felt so weak and overcome, like that a child could have knocked her out of her chair with- a spear of grass. She decided within herself that her time had without doubt come, if indeed the end of all things were not just upon the world. The fire was burning low upon the hearth, and made the room look ghostly in the flickering light, throwing everything in great indistinct shadows, so that poor Aunt Cynthia imagined she could see a specter looking out upon her from every corner, and still that unearthly noise continued at intervals. She described it sounding sometimes like the groans of a dying person, then like the voice of a child in distress, and sometimes like the cry of murder." Miss Rebekah's tone as she told the story grew more and more solemn, till' at this point the children were greatly excited. They glanced fearfully about the room as though suspecting it was still haunted, and hushed their breathing to listen, while their eyes were opened wider   FALSE SHAME.       47 than usual, and their mouths were open also in their eagerness not to lose a word. "Aunt Cynthia was a very nervous woman, and by the time we came home from singing- school she had got so wrought up with her fright and her superstitions that she screamed loudly when we opened the door, partly from the shock that the noise of our coming in gave her, and partly from the relief of seeing us. We were very much alarmed, and to add to the tu- mult our little sister Sarah, who was abed in this bedroom here, where she slept with Aunt Cynthia, hearing the stir, jumped up and ran out among us in her long yellow nightgown, frightened half out of her wits. "' What is it V' we all kept asking ; but Aunt Cynthia was too far gone to say anything only, 'I've had a warning. Your Uncle Warren has called me,' when suddenly a terribly dis- tressed, smothered sort of a sound came from somewhere. We all started, but little Sarahl cried out,' O my  kitty, my darling kitty! where is she ' Upon that we perceived in- stantly it was the call of a cat shut up in some close place, and began to look about.  We   48      FALSE StAME. searched high and low, but nothing could we find of it for a long time, until at last Sarah opened one of the dresser drawers, I cannot think to this day what sent the child there, but out jumped the poor, half-suffocated kitten, It seemed she had crawled in when it waE open and gone to sleep, then somebody had shut it without seeing her. ' After that, when Aunt Cynthia began to talk about signs and warnings, we were sure tc make some allusion, as if by accident, to a cat, and it really seemed to most break her up in her notions. It set me to noticing, and I found there is always a way to account for every strange and marvelous thing that happens, ii we search into it closely enough. "And I have often thought that on the whole Aunt Cynthia's superstitions did us more good than harm, for we saw how silly such things looked in her,.and it made us children very bold and brave. Do you not think so, Sister Rachel?" Sister Rachel thought so certainly; and thus, thanks to Aunt Cynthia's ghost, the evening finally closed very happily for everybody.   FAM LSF STAMF.      49 CO APTER VII. ISABFJLLA FORRESTER. WHEN Flizabeth opened her eyes on the next morning she saw through the window, just above the evergreen trees on Hemlock Hill, a long, bright line of scarlet, then above it a mass of gray clouds, and higher yet a flush of vivid pur- ple. It was as beautiful as a bed of verbenas, and more brilliant than the gayest embroidery window in all the city. As she had a great love for bright colors, she lay and watched the sky while the purple changed to a hue which was neither crimson nor orange, but a gorgeous blending of the two, and- the sober gray grew golden as the round world turned over further and further toward the glowing sun which made such fairy enchantment of a bank of dampness. Because these clouds which take such gay colors in the sunlight-violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red, as well as the soft look- ing white ones-these, one and all, are nothing   50       FALSE SHAME. but vapor, which is fog when it sails down in our midst, making what we call dirty weather. But Elizabeth knew nothing about that. I doubt indeed if she had ever thought in her whole life to wonder what clouds are made of; and at this time she only considered, as she lift- ed her head from the pillow and watched them flush and fade, how nice it would be to have dresses, sashes, and scarfs of these magic colors which the pencils of the greatest artists vainly try to equal in their living splendor. At last the bright hues all changed, and faded to almost white, and then the earth had whirled far enough to show the sun, round and dazzling above the hill, looking as though it had just popped up there full in sight, whereas -it had never moved an inch from first to last; but it was only we who had done the traveling, whirling quite around in twenty-four hours. Just as the last shadows of night were chased away by the full light of the shining sun, Eliz- abeth heard the sound of Mrs. Rachel's broom as she brushed up the kitchen floor before cook- ing the breakfast and setting the table. This sound reminded her of the talk with Christopher   FALSE SHAME.       5 on the evening before about broom making and Mr. Pollard, and she wished  more   she could see brooms made, until she began to think she was silly in refusing to go. "Because," thought she, "if anybody meets us I can be looking another way, aid pretend I am not walking with Christopher." Thus she finally arranged the matter, and at breakfast said she had decided she would like to go for the broom. Mrs. Rachel was willing, and directly after breakfast the children started on their walk. They went down the hill upon which the Wil- loughby house stood, and a little bit along the road, lined with the double row of maple trees, which in summer made it so cool and shady, then they came to Mr. Forrester's house. This was built of brick, and surrounded by a trellised portico, which was covered with a flour- ishing grapevine, and you may guess how de- lightful and attractive this portico had been a few weeks earlier. As Elizabeth and Christopher came against ]Mr. Forrester's the front door opened, and a girl about Elizabeth's age, with short, black   52       FATSE SHFAMV. curls, very black eyes and very red cheeks, ran quickly down the walk, and climbing upon the gate, called, "Christopher! Christopher Hast- ings come here " Christopher crossed the road to her, and in a minute came back, saying, ' It is Isabella For- rester, and she wants to speak to you." .1 Isabella had in fact asked Christopher to in- troduce her to the stranger; but though he felt himself perfectly at ease with both girls, each by herself, yet this idea quite frightened him, and stirred up all his bashfulness. He held down his white head, and peered shyly from un- der his eyebrows at the mere thought; but Isa- bella did not wait for him to call up his courage, or, which was more likely, to let his fears run off with him. She was not troubled by shyness, and she fol- lowed him out across the road. "Your name is Elizabeth Willoughby, isn't it I am Isabella Forrester, and I have come to ask you to join the Children's Aid Society some of us girls are going to get up, to work for the soldiers." Elizabeth felt a little doubtful at first about   FALSE SHAMF.       53 accepting this abrupt invitation; but when Isa- bella added that they were going to have her for vice-president of the society, she thought better of it, and said she would like to join. "I am going to be the president, and Emily Salvador the treasurer. We have made out a list of the girls we think will be good ones to join, and we are going around this afternoon to invite them. If you would like to go with us I will call foryou," said Isabella. "Yes, I should. But if the girls haven't been even invited yet, who chose the officers 1 " asked Elizabeth, who had dim ideas of some of the- customary forms of parliamentary rules. "O, we just chose ourselves, Fminly and I. We thought the girls would not agree perhaps; they will all wish to be officers if they happen to get any such notion into their heads, and there would be no end to the fuss; so it is bet- ter for us to take the offices, and not say .any- thing to the rest until that is settled." This explanation seemed entirely satisfactory, and so, with a few more words, the new acquaint- ances parted; one returning into the house, and the other going with Christopher down a short   54      FALSE STTA MW. hill, up a long one, over a stone wall, across an orchard, a cornfield, (or what had been a field of corn, it was only a stubblefield now,) and over a piece of swampy ground in the higher, dryer parts of which trailing arbutus grew in the spring time, and the tender, spicy leaves of the young checkerberries, in which hungry school- children so much delight. The leaves had grown dark colored and stiff and dry, being no longer pleasant to the taste; but underneath them were beautiful scarlet berries, too handsome to eat, and too good to leave alone. "O look! look! Here are wintergreen berries just as thick as spatter," exclaimed Christopher. Elizabeth looked and gave a little cry of pleasure. "O what beauties! Are they good to eat?" she asked. "Good to eat! I should think so," replied Christopher, tossing a few into his mouth as proof. "But why didn't the frost kill them if they were left out so late? I should think they would be frozen up and spoiled before this time," said Elizabeth.   FALSE SHAME.       55 " freezing don't hurt them any as ever I heard of; they keep all winter just the same, and you can find them in the spring as good as they are now. They pop their little red heads up from under the snow and look real cunning now, I tell you." Some of the little red heads did not pop up on the next spring, as the stuffed-out pockets of Elizabeth's apron testified, after the children had eaten as many as they wished, and taken away their hands full beside. Through the turnstile in the fence, across the pasture, up the road a bit, and then down a winding lane, across a brook, and through a wood, then came the river with the covered bridge over it. Across the river, in a speck of a house close by the bridge-gate, lived Mr. Pollard the toll- gatherer, who was also the broom-maker that the children had come to see.   56      FALSE STTAMF. OHFAPT"ER VIII. THEi OLD NOON-HOUSE. As the children came upon the bridge a man drove on also with a pair of horses and a wagon loaded with wooden pails. The tread of the horses, and the rolling of the heavy wagon rattling and creaking along, jarred the bridge so much that it seemed to fairly tremble under her feet, and Elizabeth began to be really frightened lest it should break and let them all down into the water, which she could see through the wide cracks dashing and foam- ing over the rocks below. But she only stepped as lightly as she could without saying a word, because fear, in her mind, was a great disgrace. Suddenly she exclaimed, " Christopher, see there! The horses have almost come to the end of the bridge, and they cannot go through the little door. It isn't wide enough; what can they do?   FALSE SHTAM1.      57 Much to her displeasure, Christopher began to laugh. "Now I should like to know what you are laughing at " said she indignantly. "Wait a minute and you will see, goosey," he replied. As he spoke a young girl came out of the small house just beyond, and pulling upon a stout cord, the gate at the end of the bridge immediately began to rise slowly, while a little bell fastened to it tinkled out with a musical sound. ( There, now you see, don't you? And they have that bell on the gate so nobody can open it and get through without the folks in the house knowing it," said Christopher. "I knew that long ago. And I knew that was a gate there too, of course. I have seen gates at the drawhridges going out from Boston hundreds of times, only I didn't happen to think; and you are a goosey yourself," replied Flizabeth pettishy, with her face as red. as the wintergreen berries. She did not in reality care at all for what Christopher said, but she was very much morti-   58      FALSE SHAME. fled to have exposed her ignorance in something which he, who had lived all his life long by the toll-gate, knew,- and which, as she said, she might have known herself if she had stopped to think. So she pouted, and drew her mouth into a disagreeable pucker. However, there was one good thing about Elizabeth, her pouts did not last very long, but like a shower in April soon went away and left smiling weather, which was surely a favor and right so far as it went, because the sooner we stop sinning the better. For a cross look, -though it may seem a very small thing to us, in the sight of the holy God is always a sin. And O, to think of the multitudes of times we do this evil in his sight! When we remember how often we fall short of the perfect law which he has given us, we can only hope for forgiveness because Christ has loved us, and died that we might be saved from our sins. But Elizabeth never thought whom she was offending by her cross looks and feelings. She only thought of herself, very foolishy. However, the sight of Mr. Pollard's dog standing on the doorstep diverted her from   FALSE SHAME.       59 herself, and so her ill humor went speedily away. "Lightfoot! Here, Lightfoot Pollard! Get out of the way, sir," said the little girl who had opened the gate. The dog winked, and shook his long white ears, then walked gravely into the house, where the children followed him. "O what a beautiful dog! You must think everything of him, don't you? He is perfectly splendid!" exclaimed Elizabeth, who, like most girls of her age, did not seem to understand the meaning of the word " splendid." Lightfoot was a tolerably handsome coach- dog, white spotted with black, and what was very odd, he had one white and one black eye; but there was really nothing perfectly splendid about him. The toll-house, the whole of it, was no larger than the parlors of the hotel where ,Elizabeth had lived in the city; but the Pollard family had plenty of room, and never thought of being crowded. In the old-fashioned times, when Mrs. Rachel and Miss Rebekah were very little children,   60      FALSE STTAMR. looking as much alike as two little fuzzy chick- ens, this house had stood behind the Haversold Church, and was called "the noon-house." It had been built for a resort where the people could warm themselves and eat their luncheons between church services. It was not the fashion in those times to have a stove or furnace in the church, only the little tin foot-stoves people brought each from home filled with hot coals. I can imagine how miser- able the people must have felt, sitting and shiv- ering, while the minister stood up in the high pulpit and -preached until the sand had run twice through the half-hour glass which stood beside the Bible. I am glad the fashion of those frozen days is over, although doubtless there is danger of going to the opposite extreme, and getting habits as much too luxurious. There were four sides to the roof of the old noon-house, which was now the home of the gate-keeper's family, and they rose to a steep point in the center, One could hardly tell where the roof left off and the walls commenced, for, instead of clapboards, there were shingles all the way down to the very sills. The windows I    FALSE SIAMF.      61 were small and square, and the door was painted red, white, and blue, in stripes, with a group of stars in one corner, after the likeness of an Amer- ican flag. Altogether the house was a very odd affair outside, and within it was, in Flizabeth's eyes, no less curious. Since the days when it stood behind the church two partitions had been put up, making it into three rooms, besides a chamber where the chil- dren slept, going up by means of steps, which could be drawn forward on occasion, or slipped back against the wall out of the way. When Flizabeth and Christopher followed the dog Lightfoot into the kitchen, they saw Mrs. Pollard at a large table in the center of the room making pies. A baby lay in a rough cart, which was merely a box put upon round board wheels, with a stout bit of rope instead of a neap; and this baby was gazing with very round, intent eyes at a little boy who was drnmming with two sticks and all his might upon the chamber steps. This little boy was named Moses, and he was drumming to get the baby to sleep. One would   62      FALSE SHAME. suppose such a jargon would have been enough to frighten sleep quite away; but habit is every- thing with us all, and this was what baby Pol- lard was accustomed to. Indeed, it had always lived in the midst of so much noise that I doubt if it could have gone to sleep in a quiet room. "Mother! mother, say, Christopher Hastings has come to get a broom for Mrs. Harrington!" exclaimed the girl who had opened the gate, pulling at Mrs. Pollard's dress. The mother looked round. "How do you do, Christopher Are your folks pretty well? You will find father in the shop, and he will wait on you," said she, dexterously pinching down the edge of her pie crust on to the plate and pro-' ceeding to stamp it with a thimble. Moses left off drumming, and looked about to see who had come, whereupon the baby began to cry. "O don't you cry, little sissy! Here is the man that will drum for you," said Moses, turn- ing back to his work with fresh zeal, while Elizabeth followed Christopher into the shop.   FALSE SHAME.      63 CHAPTER IX. THE BROOM    SHOP. THERE was only a partition of boards between the shop and the kitchen, but the boards were whitewashed, as well as the other walls of the rooms, and looked very clean and white. There were two windows in the shop, one looking out upon the river and the other upon the garden, which sloped to the edge of the water, and in the summer was a very pretty sight. How- ever, now the flowers were all dead, the veg- etables gathered, and a little black and white pig was rooting and running about. over the beds. When the children came in 'Mr. Pollard was sitting upon a bench with a broom, fastened by the brush into a vice before him, the handle being high in the air. He was sewing back and forth with twine and a stout needle, putting in the stitches which keep the broom flat and make it strong.   "      FALSE SiTTAMB. A little boy, not so old as Moses, and not yet out of gowns, sat on the floor building houses of the bits of broomstalk with which the floor was covered. Hie looked as satisfied as though they had been the handsomest buildin-blocks in the world, and Elizabeth had never taken any more pleasure with her costly baby house than he did with the long settlement of houses and barns and bridges which he had spread over half the floor. A pile of broom corn was heaped in one cor- ner of the room, dried and cut ready for use, and, across the end were several rows of finished brooms leaned up against the wall. Mr. Pollard, who was a little bald man with twhinklmng black eyes, looked up and nodded in a friendly way when the children came in. "Good morning, Christopher! Good morn- ing. And this is the Boston girl with you, is it? Good day to you, miss. Sit down, will you Sit down, if yon can find a cleanplace, said he. This was only Mr. Pollard's odd way of speaking, for really there did not seem to be a   FALSE SHAMVE.      65 speck of dirt in the whole house, for the litter of broom-corn could not be considered dirt. "I have come to get a broom for Mrs. Har-- rington,"' said Christopher. "She said she would like it a little lighter than the one she had the last time." "Ah, that indeed!" returned Mr. Pollard, rub- bing his head and looking thougihtful. "I don't believe I can accommodate her, for all the brooms I have on hand are a very heavy article, made on purpose for the Haversold folks. They have taken a notion, over this side of the river, to have an extra heavy broom, and they are willing to pay an extra price for them. But I will tell you what I can do. If you are in no great strait to get home, I will go right to mak- ing you one to order." This arrangement was quite satisfactory, espe- cially to Elizabeth, who would, however, by no means express any pleasure, but sat pretending to look from the window at the river, although she was really noticing every motion of the broom-maker; just as you have seen a cat pre- tend to see everything excepting the little   tO0C .   " FALSE SEAMS. mouse she is playing with, and intending to eat presently. " Now what kind of a handle do you take it Mrs. Harrington would fancy most a " said Mr. Pollard, when he had finished tying the broom already in the vice, and had put it with those already done. " This one, I think," said Christopher, picking from the pile of sticks one -painted red, and banded about with several narrow strips of gold leaf. Mr. Pollard selected an armful of the brush, and sitting upon a bench, put his feet upon an enormous spool of wire. Then he laid all around the end of the red broomstick the shortest, crookedest pieces of broom corn, and wound the wire, which he had before fastened to the han- dle by a nail, several times very tightly about it, unwinding it from the spool at the same time by turning it with his feet. After putting sev- eral rows of brush and wire on in this way, he put on the longer, nicer pieces, arranging them partly over and partly under the wire, in a sort of braiding something like basket work, as you can see by looking at a broom. When he had    FALS EH i  M UA. NNE{ thus tied on enough, he twisted the wire several times tightly around, and fastening it with an- other nail, broke it from the spool, and cut off closely the top of the broom corn which came above the wire. But the brush thrust itself out in every di- rection until he had screwed it tightly into the vice and sewed it back and forth with the stout twine and great needle. After that he took it to a large block of wood, and with an ax trim- med off the ends of the brush to make it even. Then the broom was done. "Pooh!   That is nothing; I could do that just as easy as fiddlestick," said Elizabeth. "Well, I will lend you my tools and let you try," replied the broom-maker, laughing and twinkling his merry eyes. "I do not wish to try. It is time to go home," said Elizabeth, who disliked his laughing at her. On the way home Christopher played at being soldier, changing on the instant from color-bearer to officer, to sentry, and to private, and carrying the broom accordingly, as flag, sword, musket, or knapsack.   68      FALSE SIA MP. Elizabeth was so much diverted by this game that she entirely forget to be ashamed of walking with a boy who carried a broom; and she ran into the kitchen, glowing with ani- mation and exercise, and quite enthusiastic about brooms and broom-making. o       FALSE SHTAME.      69 CTTAPTER X. THE CH l!DREN,S AID SOClETY. ELIZABETH had hardly finished her dinner when she saw Isabella Forrester coming up the hill, and ran out eagerly to meet her. "I can go! Aunt Rachel says I can go!" she called, while they were yet five corners of the Virginia fence apart. "O good! Can you go right off now I We have got lots of places to go to," returned Isa- bella. "Yes I Just as soon as I get on my hat and cloak." So Isabella went in to wait for her, and what do you think Elizabeth did? Pouted and said she did not wish to go, be- cause Mrs. Rachel thought it not necessary for her to wear her nice fur cloak, and best hat with the red heron's wing on it. "I think it may storm before you come back, my dear, and your hood and waterproof will 5   70  '     FALSE SHAMi.    I be much more suitable for the dayv and the walk.'               - Elizabeth did not reply, but sat on the side of the bed in her room, kicking her foot back and forth, and frowning. Seeing her in such a bad mood, Mrs. Rachel, without saying another word, left her, and going down stairs into the kitchen where Isabella waited, talked so cheerfully about the school which she attended, and the society the little girls were forming, that she forgot to wonder what had become of Flizabeth. Meantime Elizabeth, who could hear their I pleasant voices, was getting very tired of kick- ing her foot back and forth, and mumbling to herself about the disgrace of being seen in her second best clothes. "I wont go if I must wear such old duds, that look worse than any paddy child, and my papa doesn't wish me to dress shabby. I will never go! Never, never! It is of no use for Isabella to wait for me." Ah, dear child! Which is worse to see, a plain hat or a cross face a I will tell you what a good man who lived many years ago thought   FALSE SR AMEY.      71 about it. "Whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price." Poor Elizabeth did not th;nk of this, but she got quite tired of pouting and staying by her- self, for that made it much more difficult to re- main cross, so presently she began to change her mind. "I don't care much what I wear in such an old paddy town as this. There is nobody here fit to be noticed any way. The poorest street in Boston is better than the whole of Tillington, and the shabbiest girl there has seen more hand- some things that all the people in this old town," she said." So the meek. and quiet spirit had not come yet; even though Elizabeth did slowly put on her hood and waterproof and go down stairs a step at a time as if she were pulled against her will. When she came in sight of Isabella, looking so bright and happy, the ill nature began to go   72      FALSE S-HAME. away, and by the time the little girls were down the hill in the main road they were chattering as merrily as though they had known each other all their lives, and as though there were never such a thing as a wry face in the world; while Christopher, who was putting up some roadside fence a high wind had blown down, looked after them, enviously, inclined to think that for once it was quite unlucky he had been born to panta- loons instead of gowns. "First we must go to Dr. Salvador's after Emily. I promised to call for her," said Isa- bella. "Yes, I shall like that. I am some ac- quainted with Emily Salvador. I have never spoken to her yet, but she sits in the next pew to ours at church, and I know her. She wears an elegant hat, don't you think so " This acquaintance was rather slight, to be sure, but it proved enough to make the girls quite at home with each other at once. Dr. Salvador lived about as far from the old Willoughby house as Mr. Forrester did, only in the opposite direction; and after this Elizabeth found in these girls two fast friends, whose bo-   FALSE SRTAMT.      73 ciety did her a great deal of good. For though they had plenty of faults of their own, they were not troubled with her false shame, and so by slow degrees she learned to give up a great many silly notions and break herself of some foolish habits. I suppose Juliana Sprague will be mad if we don't ask her," said Isabella Forrester. "Yes, we shall have to ask her any way. And if she comes, Cornelia Jewsbury will have to; they are always together, you know. But let's not have Amanda Loudrough. She can't sew a bit good, for one thing; and then, for an- other, she gets mad so easy and flies up at every little thing, if everybody doesn't do just ex- actly to suit her. She would be in a fuss about I   something all the while, and spoil all our fun, . returned Emily. Hearing this, Elizabeth thought to herself how careful she would be never to " fly up " about whatever might happen, and secretly re- solved she would not even scowl once. That was an excellent resolution for her to make, but she found, like the rest of us, that a bad habit cannot be thrown away like a nettle I,'    74       FALSE SHAME,. which one may pluck up by the roots. "By little and little the bird builds her nest," and by little and little we must build up new charac- ters. So we must not be discouraged if we find ourselves forgetting our good endeavors again and again. And besides all this trying, it is best also to ask our Lord to help us, for without his help we are but weak creatures; and we must ask him really in earnest, and then try all the harder, thinking what a great and holy friend we displease every time we sin. "Let us go for Marvarette. Hitchcock first. She will be more apt to join if we ask her before we do the others. She will be a real good one, and if she joins Henrietta Adams will be sure to, and then she can get pins and cotton and everything for nothing out of her father's store,' said Emnnily. This plan met with Isabella's approval, so they went toward the little brown cottage where Mavarette Hitchcock lived with her mother quite alone, now her father, like Elizabeth's, had gone into the army. The Willoughby house was a full mile from the yillage, where was the depot, the church,   FALSE SHAMRE.       75 and the stores; but houses were scattered thickly all along to the very foot of Willoughby Hill, and Mrs. Hitchcock lived just half way between. Her brown cottage stood back from the road, and after going through the gate, which swung by a flat-iron for a weight, the girls walked up a graveled path which was bordered on each- side by pretty flowering plants in the summer time, and even now some hardy tufts of violet and white chrysanthemum held up their cheer- ful heads in spite of wind and weather. KMavarette was sitting by the window, and seeing the girls she ran immediately to the door and took them directly into the sitting- room, where a wood fire burned in an open fire- place, and the bright brass fire-set glittered and    shone in the blazing light. Mrs. Hitchcock had gone out, and the cat was asleep in her chair, with one paw over his head; a canary bird was singing with all the skill of his little throat from a cage at the window, and several pretty pic- tures hung about the walls, while a table was covered with books and papers and a basket of needlework. Altogether the room looked very pleasant and cozy.   76       FALSE SHAM ME. ]Mavarette was embroidering a slipper for her father against the happy day when he should come home; and in one chair lay a heap of bright worsted, which the girls had to admire, together with her work. Then Isabella began about the Children's Aid Society. "We are going to have the girls each bring all the calico they can get, to piece into bed- quilts; and besides, we are going to make pin- balls and comfort-bags as many as we can. Em- ily's sister, Edith, has thought up a motto for our society: 'Little clusters help to fill the garner too.' Isn't it good " "Yes, good enough. But I don't think I shall join. I should like to ever so much, but I can't possibly. I have got these slippers to do for my father, and that will take up every minute out of school that I shall have to spare. Miy music lessons take a sight of time," returned ]Mavarette. This was all she said; but Isabella knew what was the trouble, for she saw a displeased look come over her face when the names of the offi- cers were mentioned, so she spoke right out. "Every girl can't be an officer, and as we   FALSE SHAME. N7 started the society we had the best right to ap- point ourselves," said she. "Pooh! office is nothing in such a little dud of a society. I wouldn't be in one'if I could; though seeing that my father is in the army I think it belongs to me as much as anybody," Mavarette answered quickly. But before there was time for any sharp words or feelings Elizabeth spoke: You may be vice-president instead of me. I think you oaght to be more than me, because you live here and know all the girls." This generosity made Mavarette feel ashamed of herself, but she only said, "Thank you, I don't wish to be it. I cannot possibly spare the time." Then Isabella and F'mily, who had been whispering together across the room, came up. "'Emily can be secretary, and you can be treasurer. Have you got a. good big box or something to keep the money in 8 " asked Isa- bella. At this promising proposal Mavarette looked appeased. "Well, I don't know but I will be the treas-   78      FALSE SH A M F,. urer; that wont take much time," said she presently, and in five minutes more she was talking and planning as eagerly as the others about the new society. When the girls came away from Mrs. Hitch- cock's they found the snow already beginning to fall, for winter had now fully come. ' "It is not worth going back for a little snow, is it? We none of us have on anything that snow will hurt, have we?" suggested Emily. "O no! let's not go back now we have started out," answered Isabella. "Isn't it lucky I wore my waterproof and hood a " chimed in Elizabeth, who, I am happy to say, by this time was really ashamed of her pout about the fur cape, and hat with the scar- let heron's wing. So they went on. Of course Henrietta Adams would join now Mavarette Hitchcock had promised, and indeed they did not find one little girl but would be delighted to go and bring a famous supply of calico. By tea-time they had seen every one on the list, and the first meeting was to be on the next. Saturday afternoon at Isabella Forrester's.   FALSE SI'AMYB.      79 CHAPTER XI. MOSES POLLARD. FOR two days and- two nights it snowed and snowed, until the fence rails were covered deep, the tree branches and the roofs. Then the sun came out, much to Eilizabeth's relief, for she thought surely the house would be buried en- tirely, and then how could she ever go to the meeting of the Children's Aid Society on Sat- urday ."  But there was no danger of that. The snow fluttered down slower and slower, till at last it stopped falling altogether; then the gray clouds rolled away and showed the blue sky behind them, and the sun shining as brightly as ever. The little pine trees held up their straight arms, filled in so full of snow that they looked like giant candelabras ; and the young hemlocks were bowed over to the very ground with the white weight upon them. Elizabeth thought she should never be tired   80      FALSE SHA ME. looking at the landscape, for she had seen noth- ing like it before in her whole life, only a few times when she had passed by Boston Common just after a snow-storm. She stood by the window watching a snow- plow drawn by a yoke of oxen up and down along all the roads and byways, until finally it started up the hill to break a path to the Wil- loughby house itself. As the oxen toiled slowly along through the drifted snow and came near- er and nearer, Elizabeth finally made out Mr. Pollard, the broom-maker, to be the driver, while little Moses was perched upon the plow, crying with the cold. "Poor thing, do let him come in and warm," said Mrs. Rachel in her motherly way, bustling to the door. "'Well, thank you kindly. I rather think, ]Mosey, you'd better go in and stay by the fire till father comes back, then he will call and get you," said Mr. Pollard. So little Moses came in, still snuffling and whimpering, and had a place in the warmest corner to thaw out his half frozen nose and toes. While he was yet too cold to do anything else,   FALSE S]A AME.     81 he used his eyes most faithfully, staring about the room as though he were taking an account of the Willoughby stock; for the Pollard child- ren had never had many lessons in good manners. Presently his tongue thawed out. "What a queer room this is I I should think you would. bump your head against that thing," said he, pointing to the great beam which ran across the middle of the low ceiling to support it, ac- cording to the fashion among builders in old times. Then he took another survey. "What wide window-seats! Are the walls all wood clear through that deep, do you expect?" he asked. c; I do not know. Sometimes, by the sounds, I think they are filled with ats," said Mrs. Rachel, much amused that so small a boy should think of such a question. But Moses -could think of a great many things to ask, having a very inquisitive mind. "What are you putting on them things for Z " he inquired, as Mrs. Rachel began to place the napkins beside the plates in laying the dinner table. "Thesea O these are napkins, to keep our   82      FALSE SHBAMF. dresses clean when we eat. Shant you wish for one to pin around your neck over your new jacket, so you need not soil it?" Moses did not reply directly, but stared the more with his great eyes. "Is that one your'n with the rivet on it?" asked he, pointing to Elizabeth's silver napkin ring. ERlizabeth was so much amused at this droll inquiry that she fell to kissing the cat in order to hide her face. At the samne time she was fairly blushing for the child. Yet his ignorance was nothing to blush for, because he had nev- 'er been taught better; and he was none to blame for this, nor for his incorrect ways of speaking. When he came to go away, however, some- thing happened of which he had great reason to be ashamed. He ate dinner with the family, helping him- self to butter with his own knife, which he also used when he should have used his fork, besides holding his mug out as far as he could reach, saying "Water" when he wished it filled. But otherwise he behaved very properly, and was engaged in a lively game of hide the hand-   FALSE 'STAMTF.      83 kerchief with Elizabeth, when the snow-plow and the oxen toiled up the hill again, and the cheery voice of Mr. Pollard called out, "A" aboard!" Then Moses made a great scrambling for his cap and sacque. "Why, child, you are not dressed half warm- ly enough for such a day. Here,- I will find you something more to wear," said Mrs. Ra- chel, going into the bedroom and coming back with a heavy shawl of her own to wrap about him. "Yes, I am warm enough too. I wont have that thing on. Take it away, I say!" exclaimed Moses.  "Why, Mosey, my boy, what is the matter? I am sure Mrs. Harrington is very kind, and I for one am much obliged to her, and will see that the shawl is returned right away," said Mr. Pollard, who was looking in at ithe door. "No, no! I shant wear the old thing, and you needn't tell me to. I am not cold; I am real hot, I tell you! I don't need anything but my sacque and tippet, and I can't wear the shawl. Like enough we shall meet a soldier,   84       FALSR STHAME. and then he would see me wearing a woman shawl! Takeit offl take it off! O dear me I cried Mosey. But struggling and crying did him no goo( for his father, without any more words, lifte him on to the path-breaker, and saying, "Goo( day, ma'am; I'm much obliged to you," starte the oxen off down the road again. "I desire to know if the Pollards don teach their children any better manners tha that I The little dunce deserves to freeze 1 pay him for such actions," exclaimed Miss R bekah. Flizabeth- watched the child riding slowly ol on the plow, which was only a kind of hear three-cornered sled, with the sharp point goin in front to push away the snow, and she coul not help laughing at his forlorn face. But f the same time it was better than a long sermo to her to see this living example of her ow foolishness.  "Even if the shawl had been ever so ridi, ulous, he wouldn't look so badly in it as I} does whimpering and whining along that way, said she to herself.   "SRAM B.      8 Thus little Moses Pollard, by his very faults, did some good, for Elizabeth did not for a long time forget the lesson he had unconscious- ly given her. Still it is better to do good to others by means of a right example than of a wrong one. J  'i   86       FALSE SfA Rl. CHAPTER'l  Xil. MTSS REBERAT AT THE SOU80'll.

No indeed! And I am su: ,if everybody had worked with the will and ze these children showed in making ready the offering of "little clusters," the war woul have been ended long and long ago. I must admit that the president was a litt fonder of talking than of basting, that the vie -president did not turn her edges quite straigh and the treasurer made herself somewhat obno: ious by insisting upon her right to take chars of the work as well as the money. " Let her do it, if she wants to; it will sav us the trouble of tugging it about; but sh takes a great deal upon herself considering w   FALSE SHAME.      87 appointed her the very last," said the other members of the committee. "O dear me! what shall I do I My comfort- bags are all finished, and I want to fill them, and now Aunt Rachel isn't here to get the things. O dear me, I don't know what I sha/l do!" exclaimed Elizabeth on the next Wednes- day, when Mrs. Rachel had gone to afternoon lecture at the church vestry. UMiss Rebekah imagined herself to -be knit- ing, but she was in reality asleep with her head on one shoulder and her ball of yarn half across the floor. Awakened suddenly by Elizabeth's voice, she spoke out impatiently, "Don't bother, child  Don't bother! It seems to me children are al- ways in a tease about something or other. Why can't they be pretty, and behave them- selves quietly like ladies, I wonder, so a body can have a little peace when they are around?" - "Well but, Aunt Rebekah, I can't be quiet, how can I  -There is nothing at all for me to do. I can't fill my comfort-bags till Aunt Ra- chel comes home, and I don't know where there is any more calico I may have for patchwork.   88      FALSE STTAM F. Besides, I am tired of sewing, and I haven't any book I wish to read, and I don't know where my pussy is, so what can I do?" I should think you might keep still for once, just to see how that would seem," returned Miss Rebekah, whose nap had not improved her temper. "Why, I cwat keep still with nothing to do, aunty. If I were only in the city I could see plenty of things from the window to amuse me; but there is nothing to look at here; no person ever goes by, and nothing ever happens. O dear! I do think the country is awful stupid." Elizabeth had forgotten how tired she had been of looking at the endless lines of people and cars and horses on Washington-street, in a variety so constantly repeated that it becomes at last monotonous; just as one soon wearies of looking at the bits of painted glass in a ka- leidoscope. "What are you doing I wish you wouldn't make that noise," said Miss Rebekah presently. "Why, aunty, I am pretending the table is a piano, and I am playing on it  'When this cruel war is over.   FALSE SHA M,.      89 Odear! what can I do? It is real lonesome. I wish Aunt Rachel would come home, or Isa- bella Forrester would come, or something Or else I wish the snow would freeze up and make some coasting," said Elizabeth, going away from the table and blowing upon the small window- panes, then writing her name over and over with her finger on the dampness her breath made. At last Miss Rebekah began to feel sorry for the loneliness of her little niece, being touched somewhat by the pathos of the line of the song she had repeated, and remembering that for Elizabeth perhaps, so far as the coming home again of her father was concerned, this cruel war might never be over. So by an effort, which it was a pity she did not make oftener, she persuaded herself to overcome her desire for undisturbed indolence and a quiet doze. She was rewarded, as one always is in an exer- tion to interest others, by soon feeling interested and animated herself. "Would you like to have me tell you a sto- ry " she asked. "O yes, Aunt Rebekah, please do. That   90      FATS c rSTTrAMVr. will be splendid!" exclaimed Rlizabeth, bring- ing her little chair to her aunt's side, and look- ing eagerly in her face. "When I was at the South," began Miss Rebekah, taking up her knitting work, "I used occasionally to visit at the house of a very wealthy planter named Achin. Mrs. Achin was own sister of the governor, and the family stood as high as any in the state. But she was not one of the stuck-up gentry that feel them- selves above everybody else; she was a very gay, hospitable lady, who always had a houseful of company, and understood how to make them feel at home, as I know. "One day I was invited to the plantation, to go immediately after school and spend the night. Mr. Achin himself came over to ride back with me; on horseback, of course, that was the universal fashion there, and though I do not look much like it now, I was a fine fig- ure for riding then, and -was about as much at home on a horse as any of them. My outfit was as good as the best too, so I never need feel a whit ashamed of myself. I had me a long black riding-habit, with a close fitting waist all   FALSE SEAMB.       91 trimmed off with six dozen of round buttons covered with the same as the habit, as the fash- ion was, and I used to wear a hat of the finest leghorn with a long ostrich feather, all looking rich enough, I assure you, and as gay as gay could be. "The plantation was three miles from the schoolhouse where I taught, which was in a pretty village on the Wiswisewa river, a small stream not much bigger than a good sized trout brook, and I do not suppose you know how big that is. However, it was a little thing which went twisting about so it had to be bridged four times before it got fairly out of the village. "It was a warm afternoon, and we rode along slowly until we had gone about half the distance, when we came in among a scattered growth of gum-trees. These are pretty good sized trees, looking somewhat like our maples, but the gum oozes out on the trunk something as it does on cherry-trees; I suppose you never saw any cherry-tree gum either. The children made great account of chewing sweet gum, though I never could discover any particular goodness in it; but children, South as well as North, always   92      FALSE SHAME. and forever have a passion for chewing some- thing, no matter what. If it isn't gum, then it is india rubber or grains of wheat. I used to have about as much annoyance in my schlool from this habit as from anything, and the schol- ars got learned at last, so I need have nothing to say when I had seen them slily moving their jaws. I would only walk up and hold my hand when out would come a roll of sweet gum to be sure. "Well, so we came under the shade of the gum-trees, and Mr. Achin rode up to one and began peeling off some gum, while my horse kept slowly on. There came a slight turn in the road just beyond, and as I reached it I was startled by a sudden scream directly above my head. My horse was more startled than I was, and rearing suddenly he threw me off and ran a few steps before I could loose my feet from the stirrups. Then he stopped, and Mr. Achin, riding up, helped me on to the saddle again." "What was it screamed above your head, Aunt Rebekah?" asked Elizabeth, quite ex- cited. "That is what I am just coming to, child.   FALSE SWAME.       93 It was a flock of paroquets, a bird with bright plumage, something like a-parrot, only small- er, flying over." "O yes, Aunt Rebekah, I have heard them. I heard one to-day, and Christopher said it was a sign the heart of the winter is broken," eagerly interrupted Elizabeth again. "Pooh, child! It must have been a crow you heard. I guess you wont see any paroquets at the North, winter or summer. And as for Christopher's sign, I should say that is equal to one of Aunt Cynthia's best ones; but don't you believe a word of it. You will find the winter has a good stout heart that will bring us plenty of cold weather yet." "I am glad of that, for I wanted more coast- ing," replied Elizabeth, who for once did not fly into a passion at the correction of a mistake. "Well, and so he helped you on to the horse again, and what next? didn't anything more happen?" she asked. "Happen, child! I should think there did  Plenty enough happened. It turned out I had sprained my ancle, and could not get away from the plantation back to my school for two weeks.   "      FALSE SITAME. So there 1 was sure enough; but Mrs. Achin treated me like a doll the whole time." Elizabeth thought within herself, Miss Rebek- ah would not have much to boast of if she had been treated after the manner of some of her dolls, lying around half dressed and neglected, stuffed into forgotten holes and corners, and one even half devoured by the mice once upon a time;. but she did not say so, and Miss Rebekah went on. "Mr. Achin was, as I said, very wealthy and lived in good style. His house was at the end of a long avenue lined with magnolia and orange trees; and at the right of the avenue some way back on the lawn were rows of little white- washed negro cabins. People would not think here at the North that such a settlement would be any set off to the looks of an estate, but there, where a man's wealth was estimated in great measure from the number of his slaves, these long rows of negro houses had a very rich look, I can tell you. "Mr. Achin irmself lived in a log-house, for in that part of the country log-houses are still reckoned as nice as any. It was painted white,   FALSE SHAME.       95 with a verandah all around, and behind it was the garden, which was filled with beautiful flowers and sweet shrubs. During the two weeks of my stay the house was thronged with company coming and going, as it usually was, and afternoons they sat in the wide hall run- ping through the house, where they talked and sung and played cards. The servants used to wheel my sofa out there in a nice, cool place, where I could look off through one door down the avenue of magnolia and orange trees, and through the other into the beautiful - flower-gar- den, and beyond at the field of cotton which was then just ready to be picked, and had some- what the appearance of being covered with snow. I never joined in the card-playing, for, although I did not really consider there was any harm in it, I had never been brought up to plav cards--my father was a deacon, and a man re- markably strict in his ideas--and I did not feel exactly like touching them. Besides, I should not have liked to expose my ignorance by play- ing with adepts. "It happened, a few days before I was able to leave, there came up a most terrific thunder-   96      FALSE SHAME. shower, so that everybody was driven indoors excepting the negro children. They paddled around in the midst of it like so many polli- wogs, and the sharper it lightened the more they danced and screamed, and liked it. Our com- pany were just preparing to go out riding, and were a good deal put out by this interruption. They seemed to think the weather ought to have been ordered exactly to suit their whims, and then some of them pretended to be fright- ened at the thunder; so altogether they stood in need of being entertained as much as a pack of disappointed children. So somebody proposed a game of cards to Mrs. Achin, who was sitting by me. "Play cards in a thunder storm! No, in- deed, don't speak of it. If I am to bestruck dead by lightning don't let it be at a card table," she said, and she fairly shuddered. Then she immediately left the room, and did not appear until tea time. Somehow her manner then had a great effect on me; more than a package of tracts or a whole year of sermons. I thought to myself, if card playing is not proper during a thunder storm it is not in fair weather; and I   FALSE SHAME.       97 concluded, too, there are ways enough for Chris- tian people to amuse themselves without joining in these games, which are put to such wicked uses by bad men. Nobody was ever hurt by letting cards alone, but plenty have been ruined by using them." As Miss Rebekah said this Elizabeth caught the sound of sleigh bells. "She has come! Aunt Rachel has come!" she cried, running to the window in season to see a velvet hood with fur facings rising in sight up the hillside.  The sleigh stopped at the door for Mrs. Ra- chel to get out; then Christopher drove on to- the barn with the horse, while Mrs. Rachel came into the kitchen bringing with her a de- lightful freshness, invigorating as the odor of a hemlock forest.   98      FALSE S-A MP. OCWAPTER XJT. THE CHRISTMAS BOX. "WE are all invited to Sister Sarah's for Christ- mas," said Mrs. Rachel before her bonnet was fairly off.  "Sister Sarah" was the same little girl who ran out in her nightgown to let the imprisoned kitten from the dresser drawer on the evening of Aunt Cynthia's ghost; but now she was Mrs. Hamilton, and lived in the village of Tillington, in the stone cottage next the blacksmith's shop. Elizabeth - on hearing this news jumped up and down for joy when she took Mrs. Rachel's bonnet into the bedroom, though she could hardly have told what she was glad about. Only it seemed so delightful to have Mrs. Ra- chel in the house again, that she was certain something charming was going to happen. Surely enough there was, and. she had not long to wait, for Christmas was coming on the very next Friday, and before Christmas was Christ-   FALSE SHAME.       99 mas eve, which was coming of course on the very next evening. Elizabeth before this had not thought much about Christmas, for her aunts were old-fashioned women in many of their ways, and had never been accustomed to pay much regard to it. If she had been in Boston, in sight of saloons and all the other toy shops, she would have been sure to recollect it, but now she was quite aston- ished that it should be so close at hand. Aston- ished and puzzled also, for how was she ever to make ready any Christmas presents? "O dear me! If I were only in the city I could get things enough; I could go right out and get anything I liked; but there is nothing to buy in the little specks of shops in this old town, and I can't make anything worth giving away. Besides, there isn't half time to think up what I wish to give," she sighed. But the sighs were wasted, for the next day the express man brought a box to the door, marked "Miss Elizabeth Willoughby." At sight of it Elizabeth quite forgot all her silly notions about not allowing herself to show any delight, for she actually screamed for joy.   100      FALSE SHAME. She was so impatient she could hardly wait for the nails to be drawn and the cover to be taken off, for this was a box of Christmas presents from her papa. Not directly from him, for in the army where he was there was no opportu- nity to buy such things as these, so he had sent an order to a lady friend in Boston, who had selected and forwarded the articles. There was a nice alpacca dress for Mrs. Ra- chel, and a handsome worsted shawl for Mrs. Rebekah; a pair of skates, and two charming books, one called '( Little Prudy," and the other "Little Threads," for Elizabeth; besides a, box of prints and a book of pictures with those on the opposite pages just alike, excepting that one was already colored for a pattern and the other was left to be painted. Even Christopher was not forgotten, for at the very bottom of the box was a bow, all of steel even to the string, only the arrow was of wood. And then the corners were stuffed in with oranges and candy, with a quantity of cheap German toys, which made Elizabeth' quite wild with happiness, for she thought how nicely they would answer for Christ- mas presents to her little cousins at Auut Sarah's.   FALSE SHAME.      101 She looked her treasures over and over till long past her usual bed-time, and even then could hardly be prevailed upon to leave them. "It is no use to go to bed, Aunt Rachel. I shall never go to sleep all night if I go now, I know I shall not." Nevertheless her little curly head had not been on its pillow five minutes before she was sound asleep; and the next she knew, the red and black cockerel in the farm yard was crowing Christmas morning in. fl i   102      FATIS SHAME. *OT APTEt XIV. CHRISTMAS GREETINGS. RITzTzAUETH could not think at first, as she rubbed open her sleepy eyes, what day it was or what had happened; but directly she remembered, and then she instantly was broad awake, and ready to hop up and dress without any loitering. The first thing she saw on opening the door into the kitchen, was one of her stockings and one of Christopher's hanging behind the stove, both stuffed out as full as full could be. She ran joyfully forward, and just then Christopher came in with the pail of mnilk. "Christopher! O see there I See our stock- ings I " cried Elizabeth. Christopher laughed almost from ear to ear, but looked awkward and rather foolish, for this was something which had never happened to him before, and he hardly knew what he was expected to do. However, Elizabeth soon told him that   FATLSE SHA ME.     103 Hurry and strain the milk, then you take down your stocking and I will take down mine, and we will look them over together," said she. Mrs. Rachel looked smiling on, and even Miss Rebekah had thawed into considerable gra- ciousness. So down came the stockings, and out came first from each a round red apple. Now round red apples were as common at the oldWillough- by house as flies in August, but then one does not find an apple in one's stocking every day, you know. Therefore these were laid upon the table with much satisfaction, when next ap- peared a pair of fried dough-boys. Then Elizabeth found a worn silver thimble which had belonged once to her father's' grand- mother, marked "E. W.;" for, although she was not named for her, this great grandmother had also been Elizabeth Willoughby; besides, there was a nice little needle book, which was fashioned in form of a wheelbarrow, from Mrs. Rachel, and- a pair of red mittens, which Miss Rebekah had knit on purpose for her when she was away and after she had gone to bed. Christopher found also a pair of mittens, only i*   104      FALSE SHAMR. his were striped blue and white, and he had also, of course, a knife--no boy's Christmas box is complete without that. And this was a very timely gift, for his old knife was lost, according to a habit which boys' knives universally have. With admiring these treasures, and looking over those which came on the evening before, Elizabeth had so much to do that the morning passed very quickly, until is was time for Borak, the white-faced horse, to be driven to the door to take them all to Mrs. Hamilton's. It was no small thing to pack off the whole family for the day, what with the stove to fill and shiut, that the fire might be safe and yet need not entirely go out; Miss Rebekah to be muf- fled and bundled for the unusual ride in the win- ter air; the cat and kittens to be put out, and the windows and doors to be made fast; besides the children to be got in readiness, and the little presents to pack up and stow away. But everything was all done at last, and Bo- rak started merrily down the hill, jingling her bells, and holding up her head as though she knew she had been invited out to Christmas dinner.   FALSE SRTAMRE.     105 When they drove up to Mr. Hamilton's stone cottage they could see Christmas peeping out on every side. The yard in front of the house, where in spring lilacs and azalias blossomed, where in summer were roses and honeysuckles, and in autumn dahas and phloxes and a row of mountain ash-trees covered with bright ber- ries, now in winter was filled with small ever- green-trees, which were firmly enough planted in the snow in honor of the day. Outside the door hung a bough of hemlock as a sort of Christmas greeting, and also over every door within throughout the house; besides were the wreaths and crosses in the windows, and boughs and wreaths around every picture and mirror- frame, and in numberless vases, which made the rooms seem like some enchanted fairy- bower. "These greens look mighty pretty, but they make no end of litter when they come to rat- tling off," said Grandmother HaTmilton, who sat knitting in the biggest rocking-chair by the open fireplace in the back parlor. Grandmother Hamilton could not lay down her knitting even for Christmas, and she had   106      FALSE SHA ME. good excuse for making her needles fly fast, for she was working for the soldiers, and somebody's poor cold feet were perhaps at that very moment getting chilblains for want of the warm socks. "Hemlocks make no end of litter; but as I told the girls, if I don't have the clearing up to do I ought not to have anything to say about that; and they certainly do set off a room and make it pretty to look at," continued Grand- mother Hamilton, who was a handsome old lady with sharp black eyes, and hardly a gray hair on her head, although she was already past seventy. ' Christmas greens look well enough, but I have my doubts about their being right down healthy in a room. A person of my rheumatic tendency has to think of all such things," re- plied Miss Rebekah, who was sitting by the grandmother in another big rocking-chair, but without any knitting, or anything else, to keep her from thinking of her own aches and pains if she should chance to have any. "Well, now, I never thought of that. I al- ways rather calculated the smell of these woodsy things was proper healthy. Don't you know   FALSE SETTA M.     107 consumptives are recommended sometimes to camp out in pine woods for the sake of, the healing effect of the air upon the lungs 8,"  Miss Rebekah shook her head.  "I don't know how it may be about that; but in any event H do not apprehend rheumatism and the other complaints I am, subject to would be helped in that way.' However, I suppose it is no matter about me if the rest are suited." So she said, but she looked as though it were a great deal of matter about her, and appeared to feel so abused that good old lady Hamilton immediately tried to divert her thoughts into some other channel. "'Well, healthy or not healthy, I take it our poor soldiers are very thankful to get a good pine grove for a camping place, and I mean to do my best to keep their feet warm in their campings and marchings. This pair will make sixty-five that I have knit for them since the war first broke out, and I am calculating to keep on as long as it lasts, unless I wear out first. I must tell you, too, what poor luck I had with the last pair. I took and washed them out, because I thought they would be more pli-   108-     FALSE SHAME. able and soft to the feet, then hung them on my little line behind the stove in my room. Before they were dry I was called out for to do some- thing, and Mr. Hamilton took that time to make up one of his brisk fires, so when I came back I found the feet burnt to a cinder; he had made a regular bunrrfe of them, sure enough." Mrs. Rebekah smiled at this funny mistake, thinking to herself how poorly qualified Mrs. Hamilton must have been in her youth to teach at the South, and feeling a little proud of her own superior education. - But in truth the old lady's cheerful heart was better than all the knowledge in the world, and Miss Rebekah had far more reason to be ashamed of her selfishness than Mrs. Hamilton had of her mispronunciation. However, we are hap- pily not obliged to take our choice between the two. It is as easy for a wise person to be good as for an ignorant one.   FALSE SHAME.       109 CHAPTER XV. SIN  CONFESSED. He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso confess- eth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.-SOLOMON. -WHLE thus the elderly ladies talked, the younger ladies were busy in preparing the long table for Christmas dinner, and in fitting up, with its burden of simple Christmas gifts, the little fir-tree which stood, fastened to a wooden standard, upon the center-table in the front parlor. And the children, who were in the way in the dining-room and kitchen, and were also to be kept out of the secrets preparing in the par- lor, were holding meantime high festival in Grandmother Hamilton's room, where they had the privilege of doing whatever they pleased, and making all the noise they liked. In this room, besides Elizabeth and Christo- pher, were the Hamilton children, Sammy and Benny, who always passed among strangers for   "O  -    FALSE SHABMB . twins, although Sammy was really a year the elder, Margaret and Mary, and the baby, little Paul. There was also Emily Salvador and her brother Philip, and her baby sister M[aude, who were cousins of the Hamiltons, although no relation of Elizabeth. The boys were amusing themselves with string and paper puzzles, and the girls had made some mammoth dolls of Grandmother Hamilton's pillows. One was decorated with grandmother's cotton nightcap, which had a wide, flapping border, and her blue and white calico loose gown; while the other was adorned- with grandfather's funny round cap, made of black silk, and coming to a point at the top with a tassel, wearing besides his striped flannel dress- ing gown. "Benny Hamilton! I should just like to know what you are doing," exclaimed Marga- ret, who, though only six years old, was very much disposed to govern her sister and brothers. "Nothing much; only looking after a string," returned Benny. "Well, but you've no business to look after string or anything else in grandma's drawer.   FALSE STAME.      "I You know we musn't ever open them when she isn't here to let us." Then Margaret threw down the pillow baby, almost as big as she, which she was pretending ,to rock off to sleep, and ran up to shut the bu- reau drawer. Now Benny had no particular expectation of finding a string there, and he knew very well he was not doing right; but still he did not wish to seem to be governed by his little sister, and, holding firmly on to the brass knob in the center of the drawer, would not let her shut it. Then Margaret, in remembering the law about being obedient, forgot the one which says, "Be courteous," and she tried, somewhat rudely, to push her brother's hand off the brass. This, as anybody but a silly little child might have known, only made him hold on to it the tighter; so between them the shining knob was pulled out of its place, coming quite off in their hands. -"There, miss, now see what you have done! What do you suppose grandma will say to you?" cried Benny, willing, like his great grandfather, Adam the first, to throw all the blame upon somebody else.   "2      FALSE STTAMR. But Margaret had no thought of taking it upon herself. "O dear! Now she will know you have been to her drawer. What will you do t " said she in dismay. By this time the children had all, excepting the babies, gathered around. "Can't you fix it in, Sammy?" asked Benny, who supposed that whatever he could not do his brother could. But no! Sammy could fix it in, to be sure; but neither Sammy, nor Philip, nor Christo- pher could make the knob stay fixed. It looked fair enough, but at a touch, out it came, to be a dumb witness that somebody had meddled. "Who cares?  Grandma wont scold, she never does," said Benny at last. "I know it; but we promised we wouldn't ever open her drawers when we play in here, and now she can never trust us again," replied Margaret dolefully. "If you don't tell her how is she ito know it? She will think she pulled it out herself," sug- gested the Tempter, who on this occasion had taken the form of Philip. "I think most likely it was loose before.     Sin  Confessed.   FALSE SHTAME.      115 Anyway, there is no use saying anything about it unless we are asked," assented Benny. And then the children went back to play; but somehow the games had lost half their charms. It was as though the sun had stopped shining through the two south windows into the room, everything seemed so gloomy. The girls undressed the pillow-babies in silence; and al- though the boys talked and laughed as loudly as before, and tried to act as if nothing had hap- pened, it was plain to see they were not quite happy. How could they be   Sin had come into their hearts, and sin and happiness can never stay together. When we know this so well is it not strange we hold fast to the sin so often? Occasionally Benny went slyly to the drawer, and pulled a little upon the unfortunate knob to see if it had not somehow fastened itself in again; but, alas! it never had. At last he ran suddenly from the room, and presently returned with a very bright face. "I've told her!" said he, "I have told grand- mother I broke it. I concluded that hiding it was more to be ashamed of than doing it,   "6      FALSE SHA ME. besides, I wouldn't feel so mean again for a cent." "O have you, Benny? What did she say  Did she scold?" asked the childen. "Of course she didn't! Grandmother never scolds. If we spoiled all her things and broke her best china dishes she wouldn't scold. She only said, ' Tut! tut! What is a drawer good for when the knob is gone?' Then she put her arm round me and kissed me as pleasant as could be, and said, '.Well, well, never mind, dear, we wont let a broken knob throw a cloud over Christmas;' and I tell you what, you couldn't get me to meddle with one of grandmother's drawers again, not if I knew they were full of candy, just as chuck full as they could stick and cram." So now the sunshine had come back into the room again. And it was not alone that Benny had put the sin behind him for this time, but he had also in doing it made himself stronger to overcome the next time. i   '           e*   FALTR SHTAME.       17 C HfAPTER XV1. CHRISTMAS GIFTS. Give gifts for the holy Christmas time I Let us think with joy to-day, How the babe was born at Bethlehem I How he liveth for us alway I UNA LocaK. AT the dinner table there was a place for every one, even for the babies, little Maude and Paul, and it so happened that Elizabeth sat next her great uncle, Mr. Isaac Willoughby, a stout man with black whiskers, who was a flour merchant at the West, and was on now partly for a visit, but mostly on business. "So you are BrotherI Abram's granddaugh- ter!" said he. "Well, it cannot be that you ever saw your grandfather. No, he has been dead these fifteen years. He was the oldest of the family, and I the youngest, next to Sister Hamilton here. Well, well, so you are Edgar's little girl, and Edgar is in the army  Let's see, how old are you "   "8      FALSE SiTA .E. "Ten years old last June," replied Elizabeth, who was not sure she quite liked this new uncle. "Ten years old last June," repeated he thoughtfully. "Can it be possible Then it must be going on nine years since I was in Bos- ton last 'and saw Edgar. Your mother was living then, and you were not much but a little tot in arms, though you could talk like a mag- pie. I recollect you had a deal to say about a neighboring cat you used to see from the win- dow, which was subject to fits. 'at fittlesI cat fittles I' you said." Jlizabeth's face went the color of the cran- berry sauce at this, -Mrs. Willoughby supposed from shyness, or it might be from regret at the stirring of some dim memory of her lost mother. But no; it was neither of these. Flizabeth had an unaccountable objection to being re- minlded that she was ever a babv. I am sure I do not know why, when babyhood is usually the prettiest, the very sweetest time in our whole life; but so it was, and so the foolish girl was blushing and suffering from vexed mortification at this reminiscence of her infancy, especially aggravated by the laughing of those around.   FALSE SHAME.      119 She was quite certain now she did not like her Uncle Isaac, and never should. However, she was wonderfully mistaken about that, for before bedtime he had become a very great favorite with her. But before dinner was overlhe had again offended her very deeply. "Holloa! Holloa! Who wants a wish bone. This belongs to the'little folks, I take it," said he, drawing it from his plate and putting it on Elizabeth's. Now Elizabeth really desired the wish bone very much, for Mrs. Rachel had promised to make a " contraband " for her of the very next one she had. But do you suppose she would acknowledge any such childish weakness I No, indeed! She poked the bone on to the edge of her plate, saying with a great deal of dignity, - "Thank you, I do not care for it." She lost it too, as she deserved, for little Mary said, "May I have it Tou'm n Bib " This time Uncle Isaac discovered what was the matter, but being a man who knew how to manage foolish people, before bedtime he had gained the affection of Elizabeth as well as all his nieces and nephews. 8   120      FALSE SHAME.- After dinner everybody went in the parlor, where the little fir-tree held on its sturdy branches heaps upon heaps of trinkets and tri- fles; things useful and ornamental, as well as candies and toys. Everybody had something, and almost everybody, of course, just what they they had been desiring for a long time. Among Flizabeth's gifts was, after all, a real wish-bone contraband, looking so funny in his red cloak and yellow necktie, that she forgot her dignity and laughed out as freely as Mar- garet, or even little Mary. Perhaps she did not deserve to have it, but, as Grandmother Hamil- ton said, it is a pity to throw a cloud over Christmas when one can help it. "Do you know, my dear, whose birthday this is?" asked the grandmother as she came upon the children looking over their gifts in a corner of the parlor. "I do! It is Uncle Isaac's, he told me so," replied Margaret. "And Isabella Forester's too," added Eliza- beth. "It is my wag baby's too, the littlest one," chimed in Mary.   FALSE SHAME.      121 The children laughed, and so did the good grandmother. Then presently she said, "And do you know who was born eighteen hundred and sixty-three years ago, and was put in a manger instead of a cradle?" "Do you mean Jesus Christ a " asked Emily solemnly. "Yes, Jesus, our Saviour. This is not really, I suppose, his very birthday, but all over the world for a great manyyears people have agreed upon this day as the one to celebrate in his memory; in memory of his being born upon the earth a little child as helpless as the least of us. And the custom of giving gifts was at first established to remind people of the great gift of his Son, which God gave to us poor sinners." Elizabeth had never quite understood this be- fore, and being a thoughtful child, she pondered over it a great deal ; considering also that as the Son of God had once consented to become a babe, with all the weakness and frailty of infancy, human beings certainly can find no disgrace in being what he has once been.   122      FALSE SHAME. aHAPTER XV11i. "TTLE DUBLIN. "Do you begin to feel as if you would like to go home, sister?" said Mrs. Rachel, while it was yet a long while before nightfall. "GGo just when it suits your convenience," ungraciously replied Mrs. Rebekah. "I have nothing to say about it, of course. But I must confess I have felt pretty much used 'up these two hours. I should suppose too, any one with half an eye could see that late hours must be bad for an old rheumatic body like me." "Sure enough, sure enough! I have been so busy here and there that I was really very thoughtless. We will fix right off this min- ute. Christopher, here Christopher, where are you? I wish you to harness the horse now and bring her around, and we will be going directly." This direction was by no means satisfactory to the children.   FALSE SIAAME.     123 "(O now! If that isn't real- mean, just as we got well to play!" said Sammy. "Let Elizabeth stay all night, Aunt Rachel, please do!" pleaded Margaret. "'Tay, Bib, 'tay," said Mary. "Why can't you let her stay, sister It is too bad to break up this little circle so soon," added Mrs. Hamilton. Thus importuned, Mrs. Rachel consented. "You can walk home on the crust in the morning bright and early," said she. "O not in the morning, Aunty!     Can't Christopher come for her at night just as well, if the crust doesn't bear them " interposed Benny. So Mrs. Rachel smiled and consented, bus- tling about to get herself and Miss Rebekah ready for their ride. After the tea-table was cleared, and the work done for the day, the children had the dining- room to play and romp in all they liked. "See here! Let's ask mother if us children can't go to Caty's to-morrow morning, and carry her some of our Christmas!" exclaimed Benny suddenly.   124      FALSE STTAM]E. "Us children!" repeated Samrmy, laughing. "Where is your grammar 2. " "Gra'ma is in the parlor 'out her teef'" put in little Mary. Then how everybody shouted; little Mary with the rest, though she had not the slightest idea what there was funny. For the word grazm- mar to her meant nothing but the dear old lady, who, having for personal comfort taken out her artificial teeth, was in the great rocking chair in the parlor binding off the heel of the soldier's sock. "Well, let's ask mother whether we children can go, then, if you like that any better," pres- ]ently resumed Benny good-naturedly. Benny was one of the very few people in the world who can join in a laugh at their own mis- takes, and who can see any point in a joke on themselves. "Yes, that is good I So let's I I know mother will let us, and we will carry all the children some Christmas presents, wont we " spoke up Margaret. Margaret was not mistaken; the mother was very glad to have them remember the \,   FALSE SHA MRE.     125 poor and humble on this great gift-day of the year. So the next morning, directly after breakfast, the little troop, loaded with baskets and pails, set forth toward a hamlet of Irish houses at an extremity of the village; for this Caty was an Irish woman who had lived a long time with the Hamilton family, till she married Tim MacQuintney -and set up housekeeping on her own account. At this time Tim M]acQuintney had gone into the army, like many another woman's husband, and Caty took care of herself and her four chil- dren as best she could. The oldest of them was only a year older than little Mary Hamilton. "It is sure to be a fine day, because the roos- ters get on to the fences to crow; they stay on the ground when it is going to storm," said Sammy sagaciously. "Pooh! how do you suppose roosters and such things know what the weather is going to be?" returned Elizabeth. "'Well, I don't know how they know it, but they do; you can just ask my father and he will tell you so," persisted Sammy.   126      FATLSM SHAME. Right or wrong, whether the fowls were truly prophets or not, the weather was certainly fine, being frosty and clear, with the sun shining out as bright as bright as bright could be. The roads were lively with sleighs and sheds, people going home from the Christmas gatherings, and people out about their winter's work or taking loads of pails, of grain, and boards to the depot on their way to market. The road to "Little Dublin " led by the de- pot, where groups of people were already col- lecting for the morning-train, looking after their baggage, or saying last words to the friends who had come to see them off. Porters were tossirg about trnlnks, and small boys were crying papers, apples, oranges, and popcorn. The train already was standing upon the track, with the impatient engine screaming and puffing out columns of smoke, which, rising in the clear air, looked like clouds against the blue sky. Everything seemed 'awake and astir, and the children were as full of life as the rest, shouting to each other and runnlng like young colts. Somewhat beyond the depot a wide lane turned suddenly off, and at the end of this lane   FALSE SHAMF.       127 stood "Little Dublin," a dirty street, lined on each side with small cabins to the number of twenty-five or thirty. Each cabin had before it a plot of ground a few feet square, where the inhabitants in sum- mer planted some cabbages, a handful of onions and turnips, and a few hills of potatoes, as a meager apology for a garden. But now each little domain was piled up with wood, or filled with swill kegs, washtubs, and storage of that sort. The cabins were precisely alike, with white- washed fronts, a clumsy door, and two small square windows; so that one would think it quite impossible for the dwellers to know each his own home, unless they had been numbered, like state-rooms on a steamer. But they probably recognized them   with something of the blind instinct of the ant, which I suppose never mistakes his neighbor's hill for his, or of the bee who among a hundred hives is sure not to fly into the wrong one. "The seventh house is Caty's," said Benny, beginning to count from the corner. But there was no need, for just then the sev-   128      FALSE SHAME. enth door opened, and a small girl came out with a pail. "Holloa, Ann Maria!" cried out Sammy and Benny and Margaret in chorus. Ann Maria turned around. She was a pretty child, clean and wholesome in her dress and person, quite unlike the dirty-faced, bedraggled horde that swarmed from every door at sight of the party of visitors, staring at them and their burdens with undisguised curiosity and admi- ration. "I am going for to get some water," said Ann Maria, turning away and trudging on. "O see here, you little thing; let me get the water for you," called Sammy, setting down his basket, and running to take the pail from her hand. The watertub which supplied the whole ham- let stood just midway in the street, and Sammy was back with the filled pail before the children had followed Ann Maria fairly into the small two-roomed cabin.   FALSE SHAME.      129 CHAPTER XVIII. MRS. M'Q UINTNEY. MRS. CATY M'QUINTNEY was evidently a nice housekeeper, for everything inside the cabin was tidy and comfortable. The walls were whitewashed, the stove was black and shining, and there was even a little clock on a wooden shelf, and some pictures hanging about. "Where is Caty " asked Margaret. "Mammy has gone to Mitter Alzegander's to took home the washing for the gentlemans," replied Ann Maria. "Mr. Alexander's, she means; they keep boarders, you know," said Benny. "Are you all alone, you and Dennis?" asked Sammy.  Dennis was a little white-haired boy a size smaller than his sister. He was also very clean, and he stood with his mouth open and a piece of bread clasped tight in one hand, looking with all his eyes at the new comers,   180      FALSE STAMS.. "No; the baby is- on the bed, and Honorah is here too. Honorah, come on with you the minute and see the chil'ens," called Ann Ma- ria with an air of motherly authority. At her call a still smaller child, too small as it seemed for so large a name, toddled down from the lowest step of a rough flight of stairs which was built out into the room and led to a little chamber above. The outer door opened under these stairs, so Honorah had been before quite hidden from sight. She- came forward with her -thumb in her mouth and trying to hide herself behind her older sister. "Here is Madgey Hampleton. You know Madgey and Sammy and Benny? Don't you mind how we went up to their house the day, and had some sweet cake with plums in it, and how we saw Madgey's big doll with the rosey- red gown and the bonneck?  Wont you be sister's little woman, and speak up to the child'ens '" But Honorah, shaking her curly head, drew further behind the shelter of her sister, and sucked her thumb harder than ever. "Her is so little her is ashamed at strangers.   FALSE SHAME.      131 i Mammy says her will grow out it when her is a big girl," said Ann Maria in apology. Dennis, too, evidently thought Honorah's shyness had given cause for mortification, and wishing to make amends by extra sociability on his own part, held out one foot, saying, "See I! I'm got on some new shoes as hasn't never been geased." Elizabeth did not know, as the country child- dren did, that stout calfskin shoes are made more waterproof and pliable by a coat of oil or grease of any kind, so she did not quite under- stand what Dennis meant; but his manner was funny enough, and she joined heartily with the rest in laughing, upon which Dennis threw back his little white head and laughed' as merrily as anybody. Then Sammy opened the basket and began to take out pieces of turkey and beef, cold veg- etables, slices of bread, broken pie--and frag- ments of cake. At sight of this -Honorah ventured to let go 'her sister's dress and come forward, holding out her fat hand, and saying in a coaxing tone, "Um wants 'ittle bit, tum do."   132      FALSE SHAME. The children were so delighted that they were ready to give her anything, and, if it had been possible, would likely enough have stuffed her sick ; but, fortunately for the child's stomach, the mother, Mrs. Caty I'Quintney, came home just then with her empty clothes-basket. "O'ye darlings! So ye don't forget Caty no more than Caty forgets yez!" she exclaimed. The children clustered around her like bees about a cup of honey, giving her hardly room to stand or sit, the Hamilton children as well as her own, for Caty was a great favorite with them. "And sure and I made ye each a Christmas pie. Not that ye would think anything of the likes of that after all the nice things ye got at home, but I wanted ye to know Caty hadn't forgotten ye," said she. So the pies were produced; baked in tiny scolloped tins, of small account in themselves, but abundantly sweetened, and seasoned with good-will and the warmth of a loving heart. The children's faces spiled with- delight, thinking there had been th  in e whole round of Christmas daintie equal to Caty's un- pretending little pies.   FALSE SHAME.      133 Then Honorah, whose desires were toward the sugared cake, pulled Caty to the table, cry- ing out, "On'y dook, mammy; on'y dook of rat!" Caty M'Quintney threw up her hands. "Did ye ever see the likes? And sure there can nev- er a thing be left in your ma's pantry at all. It is meself that is wishing her a long life and always meal in her tub. Indade, now, here is enough to keep us the week, and to spare, so it is not the value of a tayspoonful I shall be after needing to cook to hinder putting myself to the washtub. And it is me duty and best thanks ye must be giving to your ma, and to madam, your grandma. Tell them if it was not for the little ones here and himself off soldiering, I'd never have left the old kitchen since, for sure there is nowheres a nicer place to live. Though it isn't complaining that I would be when I've got a roof to put me head under, with plinty of work, and niver a debt in the world, yet sure it is not the thing I'd be choosing that the child- ,ren must have paddy young ones to run with if they chance to play a bit outside. They were never used to the same when we lived up on   134      FALSE SHAME.       l the hill before himself went off soldiering. But a poor body must not expect everything with rent at only nine dollars the quarter; and indade I've no word to spake against the neighbors, for they be as kind to me as me own mother."1 Thus honest Caty was going on in the affec- tionate fervor of her Irish heart when the door opened, and an old woman in .a scanty many- colored gown, with a faded shawl over her head looked in. "And sure, Mrs. 'Quintney, is it a darnig- needle ye can be lending me the morning? Bad luck to it, but I broke me own in trying of the praties in the pot with it. It was me care- lessness did it, and it is a trick I will niver be after repating, you know." "It's meself that's glad of the chance to oblige so good a neighbor," returned Mrs. MQuintney, rummaging for the needle in a large box which was tidily covered witht calico, and took the place of an ottoman in the room. "But come in a bit, Mrs. O'Gallivan, and get a taste of the Christmas Mrs. Hamilton, up at my old place, has just been sending. Seat yourself and have a morsel of cake and a mouthful of the meat,   FALSE SHAME.      135 with a slice of the pie," she continued, bringing the needle, and bustling about to wait on her guest with ready hospitality. "Sure, and it's yourself, Caty M'Quintney, that was born to good luck. But ye deserve it all, and more, for ye have as good a heart as ony out of the old country. I don't forget all the favor ye showed when my Jimmy fell sick and went off in the West, ye know. Ye couldn't have done more if ye had been the first cousin of me, and I'll always owe ye a friendship for the kindness ye showed, and never begrudge ye a streak of good fortune, ye know," returned Mrs. O'Gallivan, accepting heartily the offered cheer. "We have got some Christmas presents for the children too,k said Margaret when there was a chance to be heard, producing a package of small dolls and cheap toys. A pewter flat-iron and stand, a tin top and wooden horse with flaxen tail, a wooden cup and saucer, a painted soldier and a feather chicken, each a trifle costing no more than a penny; but nothing in Elizabeth's Christmas box or on the Hamiltons' tree, nay, nothing of al the costly 9   136      FALSE SWA MF. toys, beautiful enough for children who dwell in king's houses, could have caused more delight. Not only then, but for long days to come, they gave untiring pleasure to these little ones. "I was real glad we gave some of our pres- ents to Caty's children. It paid just to see them so tickled," said Sammy on the way home. "I say so too!" chimed in Benny, who, by the' way, usually did say so too to whatever Sanmy proposed. "There always is more fun somehow in giving away things than there is in getting them." Even so, Benny. And let us all remember the words of our Lord Jesus, who understood human nature better than any of us, and knew all about the best ways of being happy; how he said, "It is more blessed to give than to re. ceive," and whatever he has' said we may be very certain is true. But if you would like to try this saying of our Saviour, go with a gift into some poor home where the parents have all they can do to gel food and clothes for their family; where the children prize a broken cup or an empty black- ing bottle as an untold treasure, and where each   FALSE SHAME. plaything counts.

However, she must needs have burnt a candle all day long if she had staid there constantly. But she did not. For six hours in the day she taught in the red school-house just beyond Mr. Forrester's. Dame Partlett was -an old- fashioned teacher; hardly perhaps what a stran- ger would select as instructor in modern educa- tion, but everybody in town knew her, for she was born and she had always lived in the cot- tage in the dell; and they knew if her school was taken from her she would be distressed for employment, if not for a living. So, partly from respect and sympathy, and partly from habit, she was retained year after year, working as faithfully as she knew how for the interests of the older children of the neighborhood during the winter term, and for the little ones through- out the year. Isabella Forrester, Fmily Salvador, and Chris- topher Hastings attended this school, and one day Elizabeth went with a pleading face to Mrs. Rachel to know if she might go also. "It is so lonesome to stay at home all day long with nobody but Arbutus to play with, t  .    "O      FALSE SHAME. The girls all go to Dame Partlett's school, and why can't I " Mrs. Rachel consented, a little reluctantly, for Elizabeth had shown herself liable to take cold easily, and she hardly liked to send her through the drifted snows, which were not always thor- oughly trodden, for Willoughby Hill was a little off the traveled road. This dame-school was of course very unlike the graded city schools to which Elizabeth had been- accustomed, and she enjoyed the novelty vastly, and was unwilling to stay away a single day. But one morning when she had a sore throat, and there had been a fall of snow during the night, Mrs. Rachel was quite unwilling to have her go out, at least to walk. If Christopher will draw you on his hand- sled, and you will take your dinner and promise not Jo step out of doors all day, you may go; but-what would your father say if I let you fall sick on my hands Z " said she. Elizabeth frowned and pouted, quite in her old style. Be drawn to school on a sled. and take her dinner in a basket! What a dis-   -FALSE SHAMEf      .

Then Dr. Salvador"s white horse and sleigh, with pink roses on it, went by along the highway, and she could see Emily's scarlet hood peering up above the gra wolf-skin robe. "O dear me I I think it is real mean I have to stay at home. The boys have built a snow fort, and we were going to have such play- ing at Esquimaux to-day.

You chose to stay at home, and now I wish you to do it cheer- fully." Then Elizabeth stopped fretting aloud, but she continued to fret in her heart, and her face did not assume a lovely expression for an hour. In fact, she was not yet entirely happy, as she sat in the low chair which had belonged to her great grandfather, cleaning her nails with one of Arbutus's claws, when she heard the sound of a man's voice shouting to oxen, and the heavy crunching of a loaded sled. She jumped up quickly, and running to the window saw two brown oxen, with white stars in their foreheads, coming slowly up the hill with a load of wood, driven by a man in a blue woolen frock like Christopher's, rubber boots, a fur cap, and a striped tippet. O 0 there is Mr. Quartus with another load of wood I I must step to the door and tell him where to throw it off," said Mrs. Rachel. Pretty soon she came back. " Flizabeth, if you wish to go to school this afternoon, Mr.   I   FALSE SHAME.   143   Quartus will let you ride along on his sled, only remember you mustn't set your foot out of doors. You can probably ride home with Dr. Salvador when he brings Emily," she said. Elizabeth had found the morning so stupid, and she was so anxious to be among her com- panions again, that she was very glad to hear this, and made herself ready long before the wood was thrown off and the brown oxen had halted at the door for her. "Ah here comes my passenger. Heave ho! Now for a jump and there you are I You must hold on fast by the stake and not get tumbled off," said Mr. Quartus, and the first Elizabeth knew she was lifted off her feet and seated on a board which he had placed for her across the sled. "Gee up, there! Go 'long!" he shouted, getting upon the sled himself as the clumsy oxen started. But Elizabeth was frowning and pouting at a sad rate. The humiliation of being lifted on like a two-years child was almost more than she could bear, and then the idea of riding thus, sitting flat upon an ox-sled) along the public highway and past people's houses in sight of all   "4      FALSE SHAME. the men, women, and children who might pos- sibly chance to glance that way, why that was mortifying in the last degree. I dare say she would almost as soon have been caught stealing. I know, alas! that she would rather be guilty of acting a falsehood, as you will presently see.* The schoolhouse was a little way off the main road which led toward the wood lot to which Mr. Quartus was going, and when they came to the corner where four ways met, one of which ran past the schoolhouse, Elizabeth jumped from the sled. "Holloa, little one! don't get off here in the snow. I will take you to the schoolhouse door just as soon as not," called out Mr. Quartus. "O I can walk exactly as well. It isn't but a little bit of ways from here, and I am very much obliged to you for the ride," said Eliza- beth, hurrying as fast as she could along the half-trodden road, for it seemed to her she could not endure to be seen upon the sled by the schoolchildren. It was harder walking than she thought, for the fall of snow had been heavy and was much drifted but she plodded along as * See Frontispiece.   FALSE SHAME.      145 well as she was able, plunging in over the tops of her boots at every step. The morning session of school was not much more than half over, as Elizabeth knew as soon as she went into the schoolroom, by seeing the dame's little black teapot upon the stove, for Dame Partlett had an odd habit of drinking a cup of tea while the younger classes were spelling. Elizabeth stopped at the door to courtesy, according to one of the dame's old-fashioned rules; then she hung her hood and waterproof on the tenth nail from the door, put her over- shoes on the floor just under it in a line with the long row of socks, moccasins, rubber boots and shoes belonging to the other girls. Then she went to her seat beside Isabella Forrester. "Elizabeth Willoughby, you may go to the fire if you like," said Dame Partlett, looking over her round-eyed, iron-bowed spectacles, and pouring some tea into a cup painted over with blue and red butterflies, which she kept in her desk. "Thank you, ma'am, I do not care to; I am not cold," Elizabeth replied.   FALSE SHAME'              i She was not cold, to be sure, for the effort of walking from the corner through the drifted snow had sent the warm blood all over her body, and she was quite in a glow. But, as it happened, the snow had gone into her boots and wet her ancles; so she was much more likely to take cold now, sitting with them wet, for the very heat she felt at first. Besides, the school building was an old one, and all along, between the floor and walls, were wide cracks, through which the cold air was always pressing. For this reason the second tier of seats, which were a step lower, and even the third, the low front seats -down two steps and close by the great rusty-red stove, were far more comfortable. But then it was only the younger girls who sat on these seats, and dignity was considered by the elder ones better than comfort; therefore Elizabeth would have felt herself belittled to have been seated where she could dry her feet. Presently the glow caused by exercise passed away and her feet began to be chilly, and then sharp pains darted through her throat; but she , would not ask to go to the fire, thinking inter- -~ -m ission was near at hand.   So she ciphered until her sums were finished, and then made pictures on her slate; while Isa- bella, having learned her spelling-lesson, was picking fuzzy bits off her bright woolen tippet to make patches of gay colors to press between the leaves of her speller. I do not think she could have told why she was doing it, only it was a fashion among the girls, and Isabella thought like older persons, "One may as well be out of the world as out of the fashion." On the second row of seats the girls were quite as busy. One of them was pricking pic- tures on paper with a pin, another was running a pin back and forth across the-hem of her apron as industriously and with as serious a face as though she were drawing the Atlantic cable into place. The two girls who occupied anoth- er seat were very intent on a game of make-be- lieve-go-a-visiting, which they were carrying on by signs, each having dressed up one hand with a pocket handkerchief and the ends of their aprons in imitation of a baby. Meantime Dame Partlett sipped her tea and looked over her spectacles upon the alphabet class at her knee, who were spelling " bla, cla,   "8      FALSE SHAME. dla." They had not climbed far up the ladder of learning. You perceive the dame was not a very strict teacher, nor one who kept her pupils hard at work studying; but she had a good Christian in- fluence over them, and taught them many things which they would never forget throughout their lives, so that she was quite a useful teacher after all. At length the spelling-classes were all heard, and Dame Partlett, tapping her rule against the desk twice, said: "A place for everything, and everything in its place." Immediately five and twenty pairs of hands piled away the books, slates, and inkstands be- longing to five and twenty boys and girls. "Take your positions," said the dame after two more taps. Then the twenty-five children straightened themselves, folding their arms and looking stead- fastly at the teacher, who held high in the air a common brass pin, until she saw they were all in place, then dropped it. "C How many heard the pin fall " asked she.   FALSE SHAME.      149 Only about half the scholars raised their hands. "Positions again!" said the dame, picking up the pin. Again it was dropped, and this time all but half a dozen heard it fall. "Schoolma'am, I should have heard it, only Horace Keyweather he throwed a paper wad at me," piped up a tow-headed little one on the low seats. This caused a general laughing and rustling, which seriously interrupted the quiet of the school; but after half a dozen trials every one professed to have' heard the falling of the pin, and so they were dismissed. "I don't a mite think Amanda Loudrough heard that pin at all. She always raises her hand that she hears; sometimes I know it is perfectly impossible she should, because I am nearer than she is to the teacher, and I don't always hear. I think it is awful mean we have to sit by her; she keeps up such an everlasting rustle and fidget all the time, we never can hear a thing we want to. Don't you say so ." asked Isabella Forrester, who was under the desk after her luncheon basket.   150      FATSE STTAMFF. Elizabeth was beginning to reply, when Emily Salvador came up with a doughnut in one hand and a cold sausage in the other. "How did you come? You did not walk, did you? Who did you ride with?" asked she, all in a breath. "O I rode with a gentleman who called at our house on business. Aunt Rachel thought perhaps I could ride back with you, can I " replied Elizabeth, hoping the girls would never discover or suspect the vulgar conveyance by which she really came. But directly she found her mistake. "Yes, of course you can. But there is no sport riding in a sleigh unless you get tipped over; we tipped over at the corner. Juliana Sprague and Cornelia Jewsbury came on Mr. Pollard's snow-plow, and lots of the girls came on ox-sleds. Nobody hardly came in a sleigh only me, but then I got tipped out," returned Emily, only reconciled to such a common ride by the glory of an overturn. "How did you come, Isabella?" asked Eliz- abeth. "Me?" answered Isabella, appearing from   FALSE SAME.      151 under the desk with a biscuit, a cold boiled egg, and a pickle. "I got Christopher Hastings to drag me on his sled. It was fun I tell you. And then, don't you think, he went after the teacher, and you can never guess how she got out over all the drifts to the road. She took and spread an old bedquilt on the snow top of the drift at her window and got out on to it; then she had another quilt to put at the end of that, and crept along on it, pulling over the first to go on next, and so on, first one, then the other. Folks can go that way over great snow banks and not sink in much. Shouldn't you like to try it? Wouldn't it be sport, though?" By this time Elizabeth's ideas of propriety and "fun" had undergone a decided change, not only in regard to riding, but also carrying dinners to school, for everybody, even Dame Partlett, had come prepared to spend the hour of intermission at the schoolhouse, and were all eating their luncheons with no thought of shamefacedness. She was remembering with some regret the apple turnover she rejected so indignantly be. 10   152      FATSFPE SHAME. fore leaving home, when Christopher came over from the boys' side. "Don't you wish for some dinner . Mrs. Rachel always puts up enough for two," said he. "Thank you, I do not care for anything but an apple," returned ETlizabeth. Indeed, when she began to eat it she found that an apple was even more than she could swallow easily, for her throat was very sore and painful. Drying and warmingher feet were in vain then, the mischief was done; and for the sake of hiding what an hour later she found was something to be proud of, she had taken a cold which kept her at home for two weeks.   FALSE SHAM.       153 CHADPTER XX. MRS. JUDGE FOLTT ENSBEE. ETTZARETH found the weeks at home very tiresome, besides being painful, and she had to reflect all the time that her illness was caused by her own foolishness and disobedience. One day she was lying on the old high-backed settle which had been brought from " the north room," and placed near the stove for her. This settle used to stand in just about this spot at the corner of the great fireplace when Mrs. Rachel and Miss Rebekah were little children. Since then it had been stuffed, and covered with green red, and white ahintz, which had on it pictures of the rmilkmaid who, tossing her head, spilled her pail of milk just as she had decided to buy herself a green gown; of the rude boy in the apple tree, and the old man below pelting his with grass; and of the fox reaching up vain- ly at the grapes, which were but green and sour after a11.   154      FALSE SHAMPE. These pictures were a great delight to Eliza- beth; she had looked them over and over many times during her illness; but she had just now been writing a note to Isabella Forrester, and, was lying back upon her pillows, with the kitten in a black and white bunch beside her, fast asleep. So, being too tired to amuse -herself even with pussy or the pictures, she listened to what Miss Rebekah was saying. "Say what you have a mind, I shall never be brought to respect Mrs. Judge Follenbee's char- acter. I never see or hear of her without re- membering where I saw her first, and that makes me despise her." Miss Rebekah shut her lips very closely, nod- ded her head several times, and trotted her foot, looking as though she had a very black story in her mind, and Elizabeth strongly hoped she would proceed to tell it. It is doubtful whether she would have done so, excepting that Mrs. Rachel, who knew it very well, thought the story might do Elizabeth good, so she drew on Miss Rebekah. "Let me see, when was the time I You were riding in a stage-coach, weren't you "   FALSE SHAMR. -E5 155 "Yes, don't you remember about it , asked Miss Rebekah. Then, without further invitation she continued: ' Yes, I was on my way home from the South, and was coming in the coach through Hanscom's Ferry. We were a mile or so out of the village, when we drove past a farmer on his market wagon with  a load of produce, potatoes, cabbages, squashes, and such like. He was a comfortable, homespun, jog- trot sort of a man in blue cotton frock and overalls, with a palmleaf hat on hishead. On the seat beside him was a young iss dressed up in a pink gown and fine bonnet, as gay as a posey-bed.

So I was turning my   156      FALSE SITAME. head this way and that way not to lose seeing anything, when I chanced to glance behind me before we were quite out of sight of the farm- er's wagon, and I saw it had stopped and young miss was getting out. However, I supposed she had dropped something, and thought nothing of it at the time. "We were to stop at Hanscom's Ferry to breakfast, though it would have been much more to my mind to have driven right on with- out delay when we were so near home. But everybody did not feel as I did, especially the horses; then, as it turned out, they found some- thing was broken about the coach, and so we had to stop to have it mended, which used the best part of the forenoon. So, to take up the time, I sauntered out about the streets of the village, and going down the road we came on, presently met the very same young miss in pink walking in. I knew the farmer had arrived some time before, for I had seen him in his blue suit carrying cabbages into the market. Then I saw through it at a flash. Miss had come into town to buy her finery, along with her father; but though she was ashamed to be seen riding   FALSE SHAME.      157 with the vegetables, she was not ashamed to use the money they brought. "I came across her several times that morning in and out among the stores, getting a gown at one, a ribbon at another, and a pair of shoes at a third; and I happened upon her as she was delivering over her parcels to her father, (I heard her call him father,) to stow away in his wagon. 'I am going to start in fifteen minutes or so, Dora,' said he. 'Yes, sir, I shall be ready,' said she, and upon that started off down the road she came. Just then a man came up and spoke to the farmer, calling him Mr. Farns- worth, so there I had her name, Dora Farns- worth, and I remembered it ever after." All this time Elizabeth was thinking what a sight she should have felt herself perched upon a load of cabbages, and was sure, if she had been induced to ride there at all, she should have got off as soon as Dora did; but she stroked Arbu- tus softly, and looked intently at Miss Rebekah without saying a word. It seemed as though Mrs. Rachel knew what she was thinking, for she said directly, "Prob- ably the girl was anxious to go to the village,   158      FALSE SHAM]E. and living too far away to walk, she could go no other way. A market wagon is not a very gen- teel conveyance, to be sure, but when it is proper to ride in one the fact of being seen by somebody can't make it improper. "Proper or not proper, the young miss lost Just what she was trying to get and had her walk all for nothing. For everybody who knew her and thought anything about it, knew she must have come in with her father; and as for me, a perfect stranger, she sank in my esteem several degrees. If she had staid in the wagon I should merely have noticed her as a girl dressed with a little over smartness, and looking, beside her homespun father, something like a butterfly hide a grub, but that would have been all I should have thought or cared about her. When she showed pride above her station by being ashamed of what it was necessary for her to do, then I began to feel contempt for her. And when they told me Judge Follensbee was going to marry a young chit from Hanscom's Ferry, by the name of Dora Farnsworth, I mistrusted whether or no it wasn't the same miss, and as soon as ever I set eyes on her I knew her at   FALSE SHAME.       159 once, and I thought marrying a man older than her father for the sake of position was just in keeping with what I knew of her character. Anyhow, I've never respected her and I never shall." Miss Rebekah shook her head again and shut her mouth closely, and for a time nothing was heard but the purring of Arbutus and the sound of the wind rattling the windows and tossing the elm branches against the house. Then Mrs. Rachel spoke. "It seems strange to me that we can make so much account of what our fellow-creatures say and think of us. When we reflect what a myriad of beings there are in this world, and then remember what atoms they all are com- pared to the inhabitants of the universe, we can but feel the opinions of the handful about us are of very trifling importance so we are sure to be doing the things which God approves. Fear Him, ye saints; and you will then Have nothing else to fear.'" "O I Aunt Rachel, I never thought of that. It was because I was ashamed to be seen riding on the ox-sled, and so got off and walked from   160      FALSE SHAME. the corners, that made inme get snow in my boots and take this cold," broke in Elizabeth. Then, as she was weak and nervous from ill- ness, she put her hands over her eyes, and tears began to trickle through her fingers. "Poor child! She had no mother to teach her any better, and what can a man know about the management of a little girl? There, there! Don't cry, dear. You will never do so again, I am sure," said Mrs. Rachel, tenderly smoothing away her curls and kissing her hot face. So, soothed and quieted by the gentle words and soft touches while Mrs. Rachel was still stroling her hair, Elizabeth presently fell asleep, and had a nice, comfortable nap upon the old settle. When she awoke, the little round table, with twisted legs, stood by her side, covered with a white napkin, and set out with the queer little china dishes that one of the past generation of Willoughbys, who was a sea captain, had brought from China, curiously marked with the family initial W. The dishes upon the table all be- longed to this set, excepting the teacup and saucer, and they were more curious still, being   FALSE SHAME.      161 such as the Chinese themselves use. They were no larger than Elizabeth's toy set of banded gilt, which she had as a birthday present when she was seven years old. The saucer was made with a hole in the center where the cup rested, so that it was of no use excepting as a sort of 'handle to lift the cup by. They were covered with funny pictures of Chinamen gathering tea leaves, wearing absurd turned-up shoes and long queues, and were painted in deep shades of blue, and green, and chocolate. A baked apple, bursting open and steaming hot, was upon one plate, and a slice of bread ready to be made into cream toast was upon another. "How good Aunt Rachel is to me after I have got sick and made her so much trouble just by being ashamed to mind her! After this I will do every single thing she tells me," thought Elizabeth. She did improve very much, but one cannot make one's self over all at once, so we must have patience and keep trying, for as long as we live we shall find enough to do in improving our characters, and even then, alas I we shall come far short of perfection.   162 -     - FALSE SHAME.. I do not know what I should do if I believed that being saved and accepted of God at last, when this poor life is over, depends entirely on our own efforts or our own goodness. But I believe that because Christ died for us, his righteousness, which was perfect, shall be put to our account if we will trust to that alone, drop- ping all faith in our own, which is at best only as filthy rags, and cannot by any stretching or patching up be made to cover the wrong things we do. I thank the Lord for this, because every day I fall so far short of what I desire to be that I should be quite discouraged and miserable if I thought we were to be saved by our own good- ness. And yet, although we are to trust in Christ as if all hope of heaven and eternal hap- piness depends on him, we are also to try to do exactly right, and to perfect ourselves, just as hard as though everything depends on us, and we shall find we need every help we can have: the helps of praying, of going to church, and of reading every day in the Bible.   'FALSE SWAME.      163 CHAPTER    XXT. THE SUGAR-CAMP. BY the time Elizabeth was able to go to school again, the snow, which had been softening and melting away as fast as ever it could under the sunshine, helped now and then by a warm rain and a foggy day, had thawed and settled until Dame Partlett was no longer obliged to crawl in and out of her house by the window. She could now walk through the door again. "We haven't got through with our winter yet; we shall have some more deep snows you will find. When the snow goes off so sud- den and so early we are sure to have a late, backward spring," said Miss Rebekah, who was somewhat inclined to croak about the weather. But she was wrong, as she had often been be- fore. There were no more deep snowfalls; "'the heart of the winter was broken," in truth, although the ground was not entirely bare for  . .                t   164      FALSE STTA E.; weeks to come, and there were yet chilly days and frosty nights. I wonder people do not get tired of abusing the weather, and of calling every phase of it "unusual," and every fine day a sign of storm, after they have seen season following season and year following year in beautiful procession, with just about so much of sun and so much of rain in each that seed-time and harvest do not fail npon the earth. "Elizabeth, Elizabeth Willoughby! say, are you going anywhere next Saturday " cried Isabella Forrester, tying her hood and putting on her mitten* as she ran down the walk to join Elizabeth on her way to school one morning. "Next Saturday? No, not as I know of. Why " "O nothing, if you haven't heard. Don't mention to anybody that I said anything," re- turnedhsabella. "Why, you have not told anything; you are too bad not to after you have said so much." "O there is nothing to tell, and I promised not to say a word, so I can't truly. You will   FALSE STTA M.      165 know it all by this afternoon sure, for you are going to be invited. Amanda Loudrough told me so herself." "Amanda Loudrough?" repeated Elizabeth. "Is it a sugar party? She said ever so long ago she was going to have one some Saturday when school doesn't keep." O! now you have guessed. But I didn't tell, did I? I didn't break my promise anyway, and don't you speak of it till you hear some other way." "No, I wont. But what shall we do about our Aid Society ."5 "O O we shall have to let it go for once. I am most sick of it any way, and Mavarette Hitch- sock says the same. She says there is so much done now, by means of fairs and such things, that enough is given without what little we can do."- Even so, Isabella. Your " little clusters " left out will never be missed; but though the sol- diers may not need your work you need it your- selves, and you cannot afford to do nothing while others are doing so much for our country and each other. However, on one Saturday at   166      FALSE SHAME. least the country must do without these little fingers. "Be sure you come by as soon as half past one, father said so," added Amanda again and again at the end of each invitation. There was no need of any strong charge; the guests were, all sure to be there at the appointed time, unless of all days in the week that day should be stormy. Just to think of it! And fiss Rebekah, as one bright day after another passed by, prophesied each morning rain for the next. "This is a weather-breeder certain. There will be no sugar party to-morrow," said she con- fidently on Friday. Elizabeth went to bed trembling, but waked in the morning of Saturday to see the sun shin- ing as brightly as ever. The robins were trill- ing to each other and chirping somewhat like lost chickens, the roosters were flapping their wings and crowing from the very highest post they could find, and the smoke was going up in a straight line through the clear air from every chimney-top. "It is going to be a tremendous ' weather- /   FALSE SHAME.      i67 breeder 'to-day," said Mrs. Rachel, opening the kitchen window to let in the fresh morning air. The children laughed out, and even Miss Rebekah smiled grimly at this ending of all her dismal prophesying. Long before one o'clock had struck, Emily Salvador called for-Elizabeth, and then together they went for Isabella Forrester. The air was soft and warm, and, though the earth was still brown, mottled with patches of snow here and there in shaded places, and the trees looked dead, yet there was all the while a stir of life underneath ready in due time to spring forth in greenness. In some mysterious way, which is beyond the skill of the craftiest alchemist, the roots of the trees, stretching out in all directions like hungry mouths, were suck- ing in from the earth something which they converted into a liquid of a yellowish tinge, like rain water. Contrary to the law which sends water constantly downward, this liquid, which is the blood of the trees, was going up the rough trunks and along the branches to the very outermost twigs; and presently it would show the work it had been silently doing by throwing "   168      FALSE SHAME. out leaf and flower buds. Without this blood no tree can live; and through the white fibers, which are their veins, it runs in every one from the cedar-tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall. "There it is! There is the sugar-house, and there are the girls, lots of them. I don't be- lieve but we are late!" exclaimed Isabella. The girls had left the highway and followed a cart path some distance, quite in the heart of a maple wood, when the path suddenly ran down a little hill, and at the bottom, in a sort of dell, stood a building almost as large as the cabins in Little Dublin. In the doorway stood a group of chattering girls; and on the hillside, against which a window of the building opened, a boy was backing a yoke of steers fastened to a "stone-boat," which is somewhat like a sled without runners, and therefore merely drags upon the ground. A barrel stood upon this stone-boat, and the boy, who was Amanda Loudrough's brother Philander, was trying to bring the steers around so that he might roll off a barrel just against the window of the sugar- house. Within the building, beyond the group   FALSE SHAME.      169 of girls, Elizabeth could see the blaze of a fire and a man moving about in the midst of a cloud of steam. "Holloa, girls! Are we late? fHow long have you been here?" called out Isabella. "No, you are soon enough. We have only just come, and the sugar wont be ready for half an hour, father says. Let's go now and get some sap to drink," replied Amanda Loudrough. Well, so let's," answered the girls, scamper- ing after their young hostess like a flock of sheep. There had been holes bored into almost every tree which was in sight, and into each of these holes a little wooden spout was fixed, which guided the sap, drop by drop, out from the veins of the tree into a bucket placed underneath. "Here is a bucket with lots of sap in it, Amanda, let's have a drink of this," said Isa- bella, stopping under a broad-branched tree from which the sap was trickling as fast as it could drop. "O pooh!  That sap is good for nothing. Don't drink that," returned Amanda, hury- ing on.   170      FALSE SETAMB. "Why does your father tap the tree if the sap is good for nothing?" persisted Isabella. "Well, it will make sugar, of course, but it isn't nearly as sweet as some. The sap isn't ever as sweet in the woods as it is from a tree that stands all by itself in open land, and it wont boil down more than half the sugar,' re- turned Amanda, proud of her superior wisdom. She certainly was skillful in finding the- sweetest sap, and Elizabeth thought when she drank in her turn from the small tin pail Aman- da had brought that she had never tasted any- thing nicer. "Here is a tree that hasn't any bucket to it and no spouts. Why don't you have them to all the trees a " asked she. "Why, that is a walnut-tree. We don't get sap only from maples," replied Amanda. And then some of the girls laughed, and Ma- varette Hitchcock said rudely, "Isn't that a good joke a Elizabeth Willoughby thinks wal- nut-trees have sap! That is city smartness, I suppose." Elizabeth colored, and was inclined to be very much offended at this, when Isabella Forrester   FALSE SHAIMB.      171 exclaimed, "What ninnies! You are the ones who are smart, I should think! Yon don't know walnuts from maples yourselves to begin with; and then, another thing, every tree has sap that would run out if people only tapped them." "That is a likely story. Why don't they do it, then?" spoke up Mavarette. 'Tisn't the way, that is why " answered Isabella. "tHumph! that is a great reason. I guess it would be the way fast enough if there wasn't any other cause," retorted Mavarette scornfully. Then Emnily Salvador interposed. "Why, yes, indeed! sap will run from any kind of tree. Father said only to-day birches have a great deal more than maples, only it isn't much sweet, and wont pay to boil it down .to sugar. And Philip tapped that old butternut-tree on the hill back of our house one year, but the sap wasn't very good, though we made some syrup of it, but we had to boil it and boil it ever so long." Isabella looked triumphant; but Mavarette turned away and pretended not to hear.   172       FALSE STTAMS F "It is a first rate sap day, isn't it?" said she indifferently.  "Yes, father says we are having the best run to-day we have had this year. It froze last night and is so warm  to-day; that is why," replied Amanda. Elizabeth longed to ask why a frosty night should make a better day for sap; but she so much dreaded being laughed at again that she did not venture, and just then Philander and the steers came in sight. "Whoa! haw, Broad!"   cried Philander, brandishing a stick, while the half-broken steers threw their heads about, pulling and hauling the: stone-boat with an empty barrel upon it first one way and then the other. It was quite time for Philander and his bar- rel, for the buckets were already, some of them, brimming with sap. Elizabeth followed him as he went from tree to tree emptying the buckets, through a large wooden funnel, into the barrel, quite forgetting the girls in her interest. "When you get the barrel full then what do you do " asked she. "O I just roll it off by the sap house window, z The Sugar Camp.     ' FALSE SHAME.      175 and when father is ready to fill up the boiler he takes and fixes a spout from the barrel to the sap pan and sets it running." "How much sugar does a barrel of sap make?" pursued Elizabeth, who thought Phi- lander did not look like a boy who would laugh at her. "Well, I don't exactly know that. -We nev- er boil a barrel right off. We keep filling up with sap as fast as the pan gets low. It would be too much putter to boil such a little mess off by itself. So when we get a lot of it boiled down to molasses or thick syrup we take and strain it off through a cloth strainer into a great tub, and after it has settled a day or two, and we have got enough boiled to fill the pan, we have a sugaring off, same as we are going to have to-day. But, however, I guess if you should boil down a pailful of the sweetest kind of sap you would get something such a matter as a pint bowl full of good, thick molasses." "Elizabeth! Elizabeth Willoughby! where are you? Mr. Loudrough says the sugar is ready to begin on now. Amanda's mother has come too," called Isabella Forreeter.   FALSE SHAMEi.  So Elizabeth ran off to join the girls, who were going toward the sugar-house with each a lump of snow upon a chip. As she peeped through the door of the house she saw barrels and pails of syrup standing about, and over a blazing fire a stationary shal- low sheet-iron pan, shaped like a common bread-pan, and large enough to hold a barrel, nearly full of something which boiled and steamed and smelt delightfully. "Why don't you use a kettle to boil off the sap in, Mr. Loudrough," asked Isabella. "A kettle? O this shallow pan is better. Sap is made up of sugar and water, and we wish to evaporate the water and leave the sugar, you know. So the larger the sur- face for the steam to escape from the faster we can do it." Isabella hardly listened to this answer, for Mrs. Loudrough, who was in the sugar-house, began filling saucers with a long handled dipper from this pan. The saucers she gave to each of the girls with a spoon. There was a bench outside where they could place them, and they were all directly in the highest spirits, laughing   and talking as they cooled the hot sugar upon the snow. All but one. There was one pouting face among the smiles, and one discontented heart among the happy ones. "Susannah made a mistake in counting, and didn't put up saucers and spoons enough by one; but Philander has whittled you a little wooden spoon, and you don't mind eating from this, Ama, dear, do you ?" said Mrs. Loudrough, dipping some sugar into the lid of the pail from which the girls drank the sap. "Yes, but I do mind. I don't like to eat from an old pail cover with a stick," replied Amanda, frowning and looking abused. Then, of course, her guests began to feel un- comfortable also. "That is just as you said she would do if ev- erything did not go to suit her, and so you wouldn't invite her to join our" Aid Society, don't you remember, Isabella?" whispered Elizabeth. " Yes, indeed. There is never any good time where she is, because she is always in a fuss about something; but I did think she would  178      FALSE STAMTE. have the manners to be a little more polite at her own party."; Meantime Emily Salvador was saying, "O my! what a cunning spoon! And it is a great deal more appropriate to eat in a sugar-camp with a wooden spoon, gipsy fashion. Can't you whittle one for me, Philander?" "And for me!" "And me!" chimed in oth- er voices. Wooden spoons having in this way become fashionable Amanda concluded she might use one; but she still looked displeased because she had no saucer, and the cloud upon her face threw a shadow over the pleasure of the whole party, so they were on the whole glad when it was time to leave her and go home. "Only to think of that silly girl, Aunt Ra- chel! She was more ashamed to be seen eating off a pail cover than she was to spoil all our fun by her crossness. Why, if she had only laughed and looked good-natured, as Emily Salvador would, we shouldn't have thought but that a cover was as good as anything," said Elizabeth after she had gone home. -^    '  .'. -A  I4   FALSE SHAME.      179 CTAP'TEK XX11. MARGARET'S BIRTHDAY. WHEN the earth had whirled over and over times enough it was May-day. And when it was May-day something very remarkable hap- pened; something which had never happened in all the world but six times before; and that was Margaret Hamilton's birthday. Now we know a person's birthday, especially when one has had only six, is a day not at all like the'other three hundred and sixty-four. The sun rises and sets just the same, and din- ner time comes as usual, to be sure; but, al- though other people go right along about their business without noticing it, we to whom the birthday belongs feel that it is not at all like other days. "When my birthday comes, mamma, I want something to happen," said Margaret. "Well, my dear, something will happen. In the country people will go out picking flowers,   180      FALSE SHtAME. and in the cities processions of children will walk up and down the streets with wreaths of paper flowers and ribbons on their heads, and a great many little girls all over the world will be crowned queens of May with flowers. There will be a great parade made about it, and your birthday will be very widely celebrated," replied mamma. "But I shall not see these nice things, -and they wont do me any good, only to think of. I wish I could have something happen to my own self," persisted Margaret, pressing the wire egg-beater against her eyes and her little snip of a nose, trying to imagine it a pair of spectacles. "Why, iny dear! Now I must wash the egg-beater. Don't you see you are getting in my way too and hindering me I I am in a very great hurry to get this cake made, and write a letter while it is baking, before the mail closes; so I can't stop to talk with you. Suppose you go to grandma; I dare say she can think of something nice for you." "O yes! grandma will tell me," answered Margaret, running away perfectly satisfied; for   FALSE SHAM E.     181 of all the good grandmothers in the whole world she believed hers to be the very best. Grandma was sitting in her room running the heels of a pair of soldier's socks, and telling sto- ries to little Mary, when Margaret came hopping in on one foot. "You dearest, goodest grandma that ever was, something is to happen when my birthday comes, and mamma is busy heavying the thinrgs to put in the cake, and she said I might ask you to think it up. Something nice, grandma," said she, giving her such a hug that the old lady pricked her finger with the darning-needle, and dropped her thimble. Grandma returned the hug very heartily. "What day will be your birthday, sweet child?" "O  it is coming when May-day comes, and it is most just here. Next week, I guess, or next month." "Sure- enough.  Let me  see. To-day is Thursday, the twenty-eighth.  Why,  little one, your birthday will come on Sunday this year." "The very next Sunday that ever will be?" -    182      FALSE pSTA Me. asked Margaret eagerly. Then the brightness faded from her face and a great tear started in each eye. "O dear me! What shall I do? Sunday is meeting-day, and nothing nice ever happens meeting-day," said she dolefully. "Why, Maggie, my child, don't you call Sabbath-school nice, with your pretty little pa- per and your library-book, and your beautiful teacher?" "Yes, they are nice in their way; but they happen every Sunday, and I wanted something else on my birthday. Something un'spected, grandma." "Well, well, sweet child, let me contrive," said grandma, pushing up her glasses and look- ing full of sympathy. Margaret leaned upon her lap and gazed into her face, fully satisfied that grandma could do anything, even to changing the times and sea- sons, and bringing May-day into January if she saw fit. But though the grandmother could not change the laws of nature, she could do better; she could accommodate her plans to them and   FALSE SHAME.      183 make herself happy and suited. even if they were not just what she would choose. "I don't see but we shall have to celebrate Monday instead; it will be only the next day, and you will be seven then just the same. So you can have two birthdays; one real one and one make believe. That is the way people do when great days come on Sunday; they just put off the celebration a day, or else have it a day sooner." It was wonderful what a nice way grand- mother always thought of to fix everything. Margaret was already capering about the room for joy, thinking that, on the whole, it was a better arrangement to have an excuse for two birthdays. "But what shall it, be, grandmother?" she asked, stopping short in the middle of a skip from a stripe of red to a stripe of blue in the woven rag-carpet. "Well, let me think. What should you say to a birthday supper in my room on the tea-set Uncle Isaac gave you at Christmas, with little cakes made on purpose, and you to pour the tea yourself.? We might invite your cousins Emily   184      FALSE SHA MF I. Salvador and Elizabeth Willoughby to help keep the'birthday, and if it is fair you might all go out down by the brook after flowers. What do you say to'that "  : By way of reply Margaret put her arms about her grandmother's neck, kissing her as though she would never have done. But though she knocked off her spectacles and tumbled her cap, the good old lady was quite satisfied. Then Margaret flew to Mary, who stood sucking the corner of her apron, and looking on in wonder. "You darling little sister, I am going to have a birthday the very next Monday that ever will be, and you shall come to it, and have some tea passed to you in a teacup, just as grown ladies do. Wont it be splendid?" said she, kissing her over and over again. "'Plendid, 'plendid, 'plendid!" cried Mary, kissing back again. Then O such long days as those were before Monday- came. It seemed when the sun had once risen that it would forget ever to set and be ready to rise again and bring another day. r But it did not forget. Friday and Saturday   FALSE SFIA E.      185 and Sunday dragged themselves slowly along into the past among other dead yesterdays, and left the way open for Monday at last. Yes, Monday had really, come, and on the whole it was very well that May-day happened upon Sunday this year, for it was so rainy a day at Tillington that nobody could have thought of picnicing or flower-gathering; it was all people could do to get to church. And when the soft warm rain fell down upon the earth, the grass, which had been only waiting for a hint of that sort, came hurrying up into sight, and growing greener and greener every hour. So when the sun showed itself above the blue ills on Mohday morning, making daylight for us and nighttime for the people in O(nah it shone upon a very lovely world. The maple trees were in full blossom, some with red and some with pale greenish yellow tassels, for they had in their abundance hardly missed the gallons of s ap of which theyhad been robbed. The swollen elm-buds had fairly burst into leaves, and there were already buds np- )n the lilacs, while the garden borders were 'right with crocuses, hyacinths, and daffodils. 12   186      FALSE SBRTAE. There could have been no more delightful a day, and Margaret marched about as proudly as though she had been a queen, and had ordered the weather just to suit her own pleasure. The morning passed quickly away, for far- garet was very busy watching the preparations for her festival; and before she was through dinner, Elizabeth and Fmnily came riding in Dr. Salvador's chaise as he went to see a patient. Margaret started from the table, at sight of her guests, in such haste that she overturned her chair and forgot to put her napkin in its ring, leaving her pie half eaten and one mouth- ful upon her fork. But it was her birthday, and nobody called her back. "We are going to have a splendid supper in grandmother's room " she exclaimed, before her cousins had even taken off their hats. "I am going to pour the tea myself, and Bridget has made us some gingercakes cut out with the top of the pepper-box, and little teenty-townty mites of biscuits, and cake baked in egg-shells with sugar on top, and sugar-pie in a saucer, and peach preserves, too, and -all with my Un- dle Isaac tea-set! And we are going May-              z   PFAT, T. sTAME.     18 flowering if you like, besides. O aren't you just as glad as you can be?" Elizabeth was disposed to be-too dignified to enter very heartily into such childish enthusi- asm; but Emily had no such overstrained no- tions in her head, and she ran eagerly into grandmother's room to look at the table, already set out with these dainties, and a vase of purple and pink and white hyacinths, almost as much delighted as Margaret herself. "I think we had better go out May-flowering the very first thing, so we may be ready for our supper early," said Margaret, who was impa- tient to find herself pouring tea, although the tea was to be nothing stronger than warm wa- ter colored with molasses. But then, if suita. bly dark, what more could one desire? The girls were quite ready to go immediately, and so were Sammy   and Benny. So also was Mary. "Ie go t me go too!" she cried, running for ler shaker hood. "No, no, little sister, you can't go. It is too ar for you," said Margaret.  Mary stopped, but her lip pushed  out far   ;8     FALSE SHAME. tough for a humming-bird to perch upon, and  I Le shook her small head decidedly, saying,  Me shant never take you nowhere when me    f )es." Margaret laughed, and ran away; butEmily, opping, and kissing the pouting mouth, said, We want you to stay and see thatpussy oesn't get on the table and eat our supper rhile we are gone. You must take good care f it, and I will bring you some flowers." So the red lips drew back again, and the rown smoothed out of the white forehead, as lit- le SMaary concluded it would be a great honor to ;ake the responsibility of looking after the cat and the tea-table. The nearest way to the brook was through the church-yard, so the children crossed the common and passed through the turnstile into it. This yard was very nicely kept, being hedged about with arbor vit'e, and filled with trees and beautiful shrubs and flowers in their season, which grew upon and around the graves. Elizabeth had never been inside the inclosure before, and she suddenly stopped as she came to   a row of graves planted over with tufts of Ital- ian violets, which perfumed the air for a long way around.  "Sacred to the memory of David Harring- ton," she read on the tallest headstone; and on the shorter ones were the names of Eleanor and Editha, children of David and Rachel Har- rington. "Are these Aunt Rachel's children, and is this her husband's grave?" she asked. "Yes," replied Sammy; "and this next one is where the man is buried whom Aunt Rebekah was to have married. He was drowned just the day before, and Aunt Rachel was to have been married at the same time, but her wedding was put off a few weeks. Mother told me about it."  Elizabeth spelled out with difficulty on the black  mossy stone "Leander 'Wolsencroft, aged twenty-three years.  April 23d, 1834." "That is thirty years ago," said she. "Aunt Rebekah never got married again, did she?." queried Margaret, who must not be left out of any conversation upon her birth- day. "';--** *,1. ,. ^.aJ   190      FALSE SHAME. "Again?  Why, she wasn't married that time. Her lover was drowned the day before the wedding-day, I said," replied Sammy. ' Yes, I know it. But I mean she never was corted again, was she " persisted Margaret. The children could not help laughing at this, even though they were in so solemn a place as a burial-ground. "I wonder if her lover being drowned is what makes Aunt Rebekah so fussy sometimes," said Elizabeth, after they had left the graves and gone through a turnstile at the opposite side of the inclosure into a hilly pasture beyond. "I shouldn't wonder. It does make people cross to have trouble sometimes; but anyhow it didn't make Aunt Rachel so, and she has had more. Her husband died, and her children too, and she is pleasant all the time," returned Sammy. "I'll tell you what I think," said Benny, who always had a thought upon every subject, "I think Aunt Rachel's trial was saoetifed to her and Aunt Rebekah's wan't." "'Why, Benny Hamilton, what do you mean?" asked Elizabeth.   FALSE SRTAMVE.     191 Benny's head drooped, and he did not look quite as self-confident. "Well, I don't know as you can understand it, but I heard mother and grandmother say so once about somebody, and I asked grandmother what they meant, and she explained it to me somehow so: When any- thing happens a fellow don't like it is a trial of what kind of a chap he is, and if he takes it pa- tiently and is good-natured over it then it is sanctified to him and does him good; but if he grumbles and raises Ned generally, then it isn't, and he is all the worse for it." "Why, Benny, I don't believe grandmother ever said any such a thing as that last in her life," said Emily mildly. "Well, perhaps she didn't say just that. I didn't pretend I was going to repeat her exact words, only the sense of them, you know. And I'll tell you what," he added in a confidential tone to Elizabeth, "I think spraining my ancle last winter when I was skating was sanctified to me, for I am sorrier for the children when they hurt themselves since; and when the baby is fretful on account of his teeth I am a great deal more patient to play with him, because I re-    192      FALSE SFTAME. member how tired I used to get lying there, and how much I used to wish to be amused." "I dare say it was," replied Elizabeth; and she fell to wondering if her sore throat had not left a blessing upon her, because after that ill- ness she had been more willing to mind every- thing Mrs. Rachel said, and she had since con- sidered sometimes more of how God would look upon what she was doing and less of what peo- ple thought about it. "My Sabbath-school teacher said yesterday that every single thing which happens is meant to do us some good, no matter how small it is; if it is only a rainy day when we wish for fair weather, or if we just cut our finger. And if we are not made better we are made worse," put in Sammy. Yes, and she said when we get evil -instead of good out of things, that is what is meant by 'hardening the heart,'" continued Benny, who always had his ears open for large words, having a great liking to use them. But Margaret liked no such thing, and the conversation becoming quite too serious to suit her fancy, she ran down the hill into the valley,   FALSE SHAME.      193 through which a brook dashed with a gurgling, tinkling sound over the stones. "Hurry, hurry! I can see the May-flowers over on the other bank. O they are just as thick as they can be, and I can smell them clear away here!" she shouted. The children followed her down the hill, and found, sure enough, the sunny bank across the brook was fairly glowing with the sweet paly- pink blossoms. "What perfect beauties'! but we can never get them. Isn't there any bridge anywhere?" exclaimed Elizabeth, who knew nothing about the resources of country children. "You stand away, you girls, so as not to get spattered, and I will fix a bridge double quick," said Sammy, coming forward with a large stone, which he threw into the bed of the brook, fright- ening a shoal of little fishes terribly. Before they had recovered from this shock down plumped another stone, and still another; and another, until a line of them had made a path high and dry above the water. "I shall never dare walk over on them in this world," affirmed Elizabeth.   194      FALSE SHAME. However, when the rest had gone safely over, even to little Margaret, she concluded to allow herself to be led across by Sammy; and on the whole admired the stepping-stones so much that she went back and forth several times alone, just for the fan. "Did you ever see anything so perfectly splendid in -all your life as these May-flowers are!" asked Emily. "Faugh, yes! and a hundred times more so; of course I have. If you think that, you ought to go in the public garden over beyond the Common, and into the greenhouses where I have been, and see the elegant bouquets in some of the shop-windows. You wouldn't think these few little wild flowers with their ugly leaves were worth looking at after that," answered Elizabeth. She was not yet rid of all her old silly notions, and would by no means confess, what was-indeed true, that in her whole little life she had never seen anything lovelier than a bank of trailing arbutus, with the open sky above it, a little brook singing along at the side, a wood bird trilling in the trees beyond, and a great golden   FALSE SHAME.     195 and black bumblebee hovering and humming overhead. "We must crown Margaret queen of May, because this is her birthday," said Emily when she had picked her apron full of blossoms: pale spring beauty, snowy trillian, yellow bellwort, and blue violets from the brookside, with a mass of fragrant arbutus. "O yes!" exclaimed Margaret, dropping her flowers into the brook in her eagerness. So the children sat themselves down upon a fallen tree-trunk and braided the fresh blossoms with the trailing evergreen leaves, and red, seedy berries of the twin-flower, into a crown for the small head of their queen, wreathing about a mossy stick for a scepter. She had not reigned long when she began to grow discontented even in the midst of her kingdom, being impatient for the dignity of poiuring tea. "Come, let's go home and have supper," said her majesty. "CO my! we have only just come, and I'm not hungry a bit, are you . " asked Emily. "I am not clear hungry; but I am hungry   196     FALSE STTAMF. some. I am hungry enough," returned Queen Margaret. So, with their hands full of flowers, they re- crossed the brook on the stepping-stones, and went up the hillside, through the churchyard again, where the bodies which lie buried wait for somethingmore than the rain and sun- shine of May to bring them forth out of the ground; even for the trump which will call to judgment. When they had passed the turnstile and were crossing the common, a wedding party in two or three carriages drove down the street, and Margaret straightened herself as tall as possible, wondering what they would think if they knew that, besides being queen of iMay, she was seven years old, and was her own self having a birth- day party. The supper was very nice; anybody would have said so; and one who has been getting hungry out of doors ever since dinner must be expected to eat with some appetite whether a queen or not. Little Mary had a place among the rest, and she was hardly seated when, holding out her   FALSE SHA ME.      197 tiny plate with a biscuit broken upon it, she cried loudly, "Gaby, gaby, gaby!" "She means gravy. She 'most always has syrup, or else cream, on her biscuit, and she calls it gravy," explained Margaret, looking in a ma- tronly way over her teapot of molasses and water. But she lost all this staid dignity when, after supper was done, her mamma placed a covered tray before her, and she peeped into it at the heap of birthday presents. Books and pictures, dolls and dolls' clothing, and, best of all, at the very bottom, what do you think of a photograph album with a real clasp? Too glad to speak, she jumped into a chair and jumped out of it two or three times;, then she kissed everybody in the room, and fluttered about like a humming-bird, laughing and dimpling with joy all the while. But all this time the earth kept, whirling and whirling so fast that if the children and' everything else had not whirled with it they would surely have been dizzy. As it was they felt no motion at all, and did not even notice that-the earth having turned half over--   198      FALSE SHAME. already the shadows were very long, and the western hills had come up so high that in another half hour the sun would be hidden be- hind them. Somebody noticed it, though, and took care that Christopher and Barak stood before Mrs. Hamilton's gate in time to take Elizabeth and Emily home before dewfall.   FALSE SHAME.      199 CHAPTER XXIII. THE BABY RIDE. WHEN the summer term commenced Elizabeth began going to the village school with Emily and Isabella, leaving the little ones, who could not walk so far, to the care of Dame Partlett and her tea-pot. She learned speedily to fall in with the fashion of carrying a luncheon, and she found the daily walk back and forth under the double rows of maples with her young friends very charming. She came home almost every day with her hands full of ferns and way- side flowers, so that if Mrs. Rachel had not been the most forbearing and enduring of aunts her patience would have been sadly taxed by the litter which was sure to come with her into the house every day about the time when the sun began to stream into the windows of the "north room," which was the summer sitting- room. On one particular Thursday, besides the usual   200      FALSE SHA ME. litter, five of the clock brought also Elizabeth, bursting in in such a state of eager excitement that Arbutus ran as fast as his black legs could carry him under the settle in sudden fright at the' coming disturbance. When he saw from his hiding-place the unaccustomed stir was only caused by his young mistress, he crept out again and began washing his face with his paws in the most unconcerned manner, as though he had never been startled in his life. Miss Rebekah, however, did not recover her tranquillity so readily. How you do agitate one's nerves rushing into the house in that rude way, child! Can't you be a little more quiet? I declare my heart is in a flutter yet, and I feel all in a tremor," said she. "So it is my little girl, is it "Mrs. Rachel said, smiing a welcome as she picked up the branches of white shad-flowers Elizabeth had dropped upon the floor. But the disturber herself was so earnest she hardly noticed the commotion her coming had made in the quiet sitting-room. "O, Aunt Rachel, the girls at our school are 'I R l   FALSE SHAME.      201 going to have such fun on Saturday if it is fairl We are going to have a baby ride. Mavarette Hitchcock and Henrietta Adams and the down- town girls got it up; but we are all going who can find a baby; we are going to trim up the carriages, and see who can get the prettiest baby, and look the nicest. I asked Aunt Ham- ilton to-night coming home, and she said I might take Paul; you know there can't be any sweeter baby than Paul, and she invited me to go to her house from sehool Friday night, and be there all ready. We are going to meet in the schoolhouse yard at nine o'clock, and draw the babies in procession through the principal streets. Wont it be splendid, Aunt Rachell O Buty, you little darling! don't you wish you were a baby so you could go? I do truly'?) she exclaimed, perceiving the kitten at last in her merry capering around the room, and catch- ing him up in a fit of affection as something to share her gladness. One would not have thought, to see her now, that she was the same little girl who six months before was so reserved in the expression of her feelings and so careful not to show enthusiasm 13   202      FATLSF StAFAM E. about anything. But Mrs. Rachel's cheerful wisdom, the familiarity with healthy-minded girls, and even Christopher's artless simplicity, had made quite another child of her. "I am going to stay at Aunt Hamilton's to- night, and you must come along early and stop for me, Emily," said Elizabeth, as they plodded off to school together the next day along the footpath overgrown with knot-grass, and bor- dered by white and red clover. "I shant wonder if it pours by morning. It almost always rains Saturday, especially when I am going fishing, and I am to-morrow," ob- served Philip Salvador carelessly, coming up with his slate and arithmetic under his arm. O O dear I now I know it will rain and spoil everything I It is sure to whenever we partic- ularly wish for fair weather!" exclaimed Eliz- abeth. "O no it wont. Just see how pleasant it is. Look, not a cloud to be seen anywhere. Philip only says that to plague us; he is such a teaze, don't mind him," returned Emily. Philip put on a look of injured innocence. "What a story I Just as though I want it to   FALSE SHAME.      203 rain when I have made my calculations to go fishing. But you will see to-morrow, miss. There is no surer sign of rain than a sky with- out a single cloud to be seen. - You just ask Grandmother Hamilton and she will tell you so," he affirmed, making Elizabeth really quite miserable for fear of rain. But "fear is a greater liar than hope." In spite of the proposed fishing excursion and the cloudless sky, the sun came up next morning as bright and clear as though he had never hidden behind a vail of gray vapor in all his days, and never intended to. Blue eyes and black looked anxiously out from windows of the houses all about the vil- lage, and when they saw the sunshine they brightened and shone themselves. The dew sparkled upon the grass, the flowering apple- trees stood like giant bouquets, and with the lilacs filled the pure, soft air with fragrance. It was really a pleasure just to breathe on such a beautiful morning. "We've got a splendid day; there couldn't have been anything better," said Mavarette Hitchcock, who, being chief manager of the   204      FAttS1 SEAMA. ride, was as busy and important as a politician at election. The day was indeed faultless; but on every occasion since the hour when our Grandmother Eve ate the fruit whih looked so fair and prom- ised so well, and found within only sin and death, it has always happened that something annoying comes into every pleasure, so that at no time can we say our happiness is perfect. From each house where there was a school- girl or a baby there came a happy flutter of preparation, from all excepting one, and that one was the stone cottage next the blacksmith's shop; for of all days ii the week, and of all weeks in the month, little Paul must needs choose this very Saturday morning for an attack oferoup. Not severe, but yet enough for an anxious mother to keep him at home. The carriage stood on the piazza garlanded about with festoons of rwnning pine and the fragrat pink azaJia, so that it looked like a huge rose; but of what use was it with no baby inside  While Elizabeth stood leaning upon the gate, and looking sorrowfully along the road to watch   /FA1RE SIAME.     205 for the coming of the more fortunate girls, she saw Philip Salvador riding up to the black- smith's shop upon the doctor's white horse. He also saw her, and while the horse was being shod came over to speak with her. "Holloa, Miss Libby H Got your baby all ready in its best bib and tucker " Elizabeth could hardly keep back the tears as she replied, "Little Paul is threatened with croup, and so my pleasure is all spoiled." "Whew! that is a sell. But why don't you have a rag baby? Take and dress it up, and not one in ten would notice the difference. In fact it would be better, because there would be no danger of its crying, and if you should happen to tip over it wouldn't be half the damage." "Now, Philip, you are too bad to make fun," said Elizabeth. "Haven't any notion of making fun, I assure your. But stop now! What will you give me to get you the prettiest baby in town to draw?" asked Philip. "There isn't another baby, Aunt Sarah has thought them all over, only Mrs. Champney's,   206      FATjSF SHAMBF. and hers has the measles. O dear me! now I shall have no good time at all." "Don't be so sure. I tell you I will find you a baby in fifteen minutes; you don't know half there are in town, nor Aunt Sarah either." "O now, will you truly? Wont it be a doll, or a kitten, or anything but a real live baby " asked Elizabeth anxiously. "Nothing but a real, live baby, now truly," answered Philip, rmnning up the walk and down again with the wagon behind him, just a moving mass of blossom. Philip's fifteen minutes were long ones, and F;lizabeth had despaired over and over again of his fnding a baby who had not been already asked for, when the door-bell rang violently. She ran eagerly to open the door, and there in the same place on the piazza stood the car- riage, but with nobody in sight. As she was looking about she heard a prolonged "yah," and going around in front saw, of all things in this world, a b1ack baby. Poor Flizabeth! she felt ready to break her heart with crying at such a dismal disap- pointment.   FALSE STAMLE.     207 "O Grandma Hamilton, what shall I do? Just see what that old, ugly Philip Salvador has been and done. This is Mrs. Purrington's baby; I've seen it ever so many times when she has been at Aunt Rachel's washing, and I can't hurt her feelings by taking him back. O dear I this is the dreadfulest day that ever was, and I thought it was going to be the nicest," ' she sobbed. Ah, Flizabeth! it is many of us older ones who get now and then just this sorrowful expe- rience. Our nicest days often turn out our "dreadfulest." "Well, dear, I am sure there isn't a prettier baby anywhere than Sammy Purrington," said Grandmother Hamilton, coming with a broom in her hand to the door. "O I know it. He is just as cunning as he can be. I always said so. I have played with him lots of times, but I can't take him to ride; everybody would laugh so, and I hate to take him back and mortify his mother. O dear, dear -what shall I do?" She stood on the steps, under the shadow of the climbing woodbine and truipetl honey-   208      FALSF- SIAME1. Stikle, looking at the laughing brown face that peeped and crowed at her from behind his gay blanket, forlornly thinking she was the most wretched and unfortunate little girl in the whole world, and that she should never feel very happy again as long as she lived. But in this she was quite mistaken, as we always are When- we get such dismal feelings; she was go- ing to be, as happy as ever directly. "(Holloa, Elizabeth! here you are all ready. What a beauty your carriage is! I know it will be the handsomest of the whole," called out somebody behind her. She turned quickly and there stood Emily Salvador, with baby Maude in her little carriage, made fragrant by heaps of apple- blossoms fastened on here and there over it. Before she had time to speak, Emily, coming up the steps, had peeped in at the black- eyed, brown-faced baby under the festoons of pine and pink azalia. Then she clapped her haids in delight. "Little Sammy Purrngton! Isn't he just as cnnning as he can be? How did you happen t0 think of him? He is prettier than any other -I   FATASF. SHAME.     209 baby I know, only Maude. I wish I could draw him." A heavy load was lifted from Elizabeth's heart. "You may draw Sammy for all me, if you wish to. I had rather take Maude," she said gladly. " Elizabeth, may I  I should like it best of anything, because, you know, I can have Maude any time, and it is a great deal more fun to take some other baby besides my own sister," returned Emily. So the cloud went at once away from Eliza- beth's face, and the day was as bright there as it was in the sky. "If Emily hasn't been and spoiled my sport! I might have known she would. A fellow can't ever have any fun when she is around,' mut- tered naughty Philip from his perch among the branches of the spruce-tree hard by, where he had been seeing and hearing everything which happened in the yard. The girls started off in high spirits, and from every direction, along every street and lane, came other girls as merry as they, each with a   210      FALSE SJA ME. carriage of wood, or willow, or shining leather, decorated with flowers and leaves, and, best of all, a baby. They made a pretty sight in the school-yard, and a pleasant sound as they laughed and shouted to each other, while the babies cooed and crowed as glad as the rest. Yes, it seemed now that at length in the weary six thousand years there had come one day when nothing was going wrong, really a perfect day, when everybody was to be entirely happy. And perhaps it would have been so only for Henrietta Adams. "Holloa, girls! it is an elegant morning," said she, pulling along a carriage with real silver trimmings, and a wreath of oleander, fuschias, and sweet-scented geranium leaves on each side. "Holloa, Henrietta holloa l" answered the girls. Suddenly Henrietta stopped. "Emily Salvador, I should like to know why you brought that little nigger young one here " she exclaimed. When she had said this the silver nails and   FALSE S1TAMRE.     2" fringes of her carriage seemed no handsomer than pewter to Elizabeth, and her pretty face grew plain and unlovely at once. Emily was not frightened by her at all, but said good-naturedly, "Why, this is Sammy Purrington; didn't you know him? Old Aunty Philomela's grandson. He is real cunning and good." "Well, Emily Salvador, I should think it was enough that we must have Irish beggars put on us without niggers too," returned Henri- etta, looking scornfully at the rough wooden box on wheels where little Mary M'Cartney sat, wrapped in a piece of an old patchwork quilt, as satisfied as the best. "I wont go at all if we must have all sorts packed on to us this way," she continued indig- nantly. Mar'y's sister, Cecilia M'Cartney, looked just ready to cry at these unkind words, and Eliza- beth Willoughby was really frightened, thinking something dreadful was likely to happen, es- pecially as several of the girls began to join in loudly with Henrietta. But Emily only laughed.   12      FATSB ST BRA MS. "Henrietta Adams wishes to get Sammy or herself to draw, and this is the way she Lkes. You just lead off, Henrietta, with )ur baby, and we will come after according to ir ages." Quite to Rlizabeth's surprise, Henrietta, lough still looking rather cross, walked off and ,ok her place at the head of the procession. he fresh air and the sense of her own impor- nce together restored her good-humor, and resently she was laughing and talking gayly ever. At every house people came to the windows id doors to look out as the children passed up id down the streets, and everybody laughed id said funny things about black Sammy. mnily laughed too, and boo-peeped at Sammy itil he screamed with delight. Elizabeth, wever, felt her cheeks burn just with think- g what if it were he* who was drawing Zn. The babies behaved beautifully, bobbing their :tle heads about, and staring at each other ithout crying once, and the hour of the ride ssed quickly away. Then as the clock on the   FALSE SP'AMTi.     213 tower of the brick church struck ten the child- dren walked up Main-street, singing, "John Brown's body lies a moldering in the grave;" and after that scattered to their various homes. "Haven't we had a splendid time, and wont Isabella Forrester be real sorry she had the measles and couldn't go with us " said Fmily Salvador to Elizabeth Willoughby as they walked off together over the dandelions and clover up the shaded road. "Yes, real. But, Emily, I don't see how you could keep so good-natured, and not seem to care for people's laughing and pointing at you," returned Elizabeth, stooping to pick a four- leaved clover. "O I don't care how much people laugh when I know I am not doing anything ridicu- lous. They enjoy it, I suppose. And why should I mind for what Henrietta Adams says? She doesn't know what is proper a bit better than I do?"  After Elizabeth had left Emily and baby    :: Maude at Dr. Salvador's gate, and was going   ! '.   214      FALSE SH]AMF. on alone, she kept turning over these words in her mind. She remembered, too, what Mrs. Rachel had said while she was ill of the cold, about thinking so much of how God looks upon what we are doing, that we have no room for considering what the handful of people aboutlus may say. When she came to the foot of Willoughby Hill she sat down upon a stone among the grass and buttercups, and kept on thinking, until at last, when she rose to go into the house, she had decided she would try in earn- est to take for her rule of conduct the lines of a hymn Mrs. Rachel had repeated, "Fear him, ye saints; and ye will then Have nothing else to fear." Doubtless she will sometimes find it hard to always remember and feel this; much harder than Emily does, for natural temperament is a great help or hinderance to one; but still, I think that before the sunny days of the beau- tiful summer which God is sending us are over she will find she is freed in great measure from a heavy bondage of false shame, which freedom   FALSE SFPAMi.            215 will make life and the world seem like another thing to her. So, as she had learned this lesson by coming to Tillington, I am sure you will agree in what I said  at first, that, to one little girl at least, this terrible war has been a very good thing. THE END. -
