ALES OF THE
'U12 MAdIAN'S 1)ATE.fl.
Amasis was the youngest of the
iagi who followed the wonderful star
that shone day and night until it hung
over the Divine Infant. Home again
among the Persian fire-worshippers,
a noble discontent consumed them.
Illuminated by the sphit, how could
they stoop to adore the brightness of
the sun? The Iting incarnate had
stiiiled upon them, a~nd never again
would they make les grand obeisance.
At last, this unrest became a supernat-


rural immIusion that sent them  apart
to .the ends of the earth, one to Eui
rope, one to Africa, and Animasis to tei
extreme bounds of Asia. Far at the
*North East, he found a causeway that
then joined the new world with the
old, and over it, and beyond an irre-
sistible desire impelled him, until he
had reached the shore of the Atlantic.
All along his route, after leaving the
frozen waste, he had traversed a land
of prairie and primeval forest, roamed
over by a nomadic race, whom    he'
wondered to find so like in feature tp
the descendants of those- captives the
Assyrian Kings had brought from
Palestine ; and as his journey brought
him near the old city by the ocean, he
wondered more to find so many traces;
of the religious rites his youth iad
learned, mingled, with dim memories
of the shadows of a purer faith which

centered in the desire of 'all nations.
His wisdom   was not long at fault.
The more he studied the mystery the
more sure he grew that, over the same
Isthmus he had come, hundreds of
years beforehad wandered portions of
the Ten Tribes---not all lost, and ab-
sorbed among their captors) and built
at the South vast pyramids and great
cities radiant with gold, and at the
North this city of Cam, almost within
hearing of the waves -whither he had
journeyed. Covering many miles, and
magnificent with pleasure domes like
Kubla Khan decreed, it was the home
of their princes and the head of their
religion - every gate stood. always
open. The waters of Tappan Zee flow
ov r its ancient site, for then there was
no Hudson. North of it arose in ter-
races a highland range, and beyond
that was a vast inland sea, which hid

what are now the River Counties,
above the opposing crests of BoterbergGr a
and Grand. Sachem-.
Here Amasis married a lady of the
land, who dying left him Aida,and her
he taught with earliest speech to lisp
prayer to the son of Mary. They
dwelt apart from the throng. On one
of the peaks between .Cam, and the
great Lake he had builded him a tow-
er, whence the eye could sweep from
Zadir to the lowest horizon, anl here
he followed his old studies untrammel-
ed, but not unhonored, for the M a-
gians were the philosophers and the
astronomers of the ages in which they
lived. So Aida had-come to woman-
hood without ever mingling in the
rites of Ormuzd or the Ahriman-those
gods of light and darkness -one of
whom the people feared and the other
worshipped. But the fime drew near-

when the strength of her trust in her
paternal faith should be tested - oh !
how fearfully.
On the Torn mountain, just outside
the walls of Cam, stood the great Fire
Temple, where the Arch Priest resid-
ed, and kept the coals always glowing
in honor of Ormuzd."- Here, too, but
separate from the shrine, was the high
stone altar, whereon oice in a hun-
dred years a human sacrifice was offer-
ed to appease Ahriman. The cAury
had nearly rolled round, and there
would be no escape for Aida ; for then
the people were all gathered in the
plain at the foot of the Torn, and each
must witness with uplifted hand the
horrid sight, or take the place of the
victim. But she knew it not. Why,
should the Magian tell her?     No
shadow had ever fallen over her hap-
py heart ; and the knowledge of that

dread day and hour would have been
more than even he could bear, had
not the Heavens shown him strange
prophecies of a terrible struggle in
Nature. that gave him hope the stars
in their course would fight against that
bloody consumma ion. Beside,a third
of a century h'ad gone since he did
homage to the child, whom day by day
he watched for in the ,strength of
manhood to rule the Earth. . Voices
within and without-portents above
and mutterings below, all told him
how near was the time, and so heo
waited.  But - the 'cruel morning
dawned, and all things continued as
they were.
Still firm in his confidence of .help,
he knew not how, Amasis went alone

covered the plateau, first lines of mai-
dons circling the base of the hill, then
the princely houses ; and  then the
common people far in the distance.
Gorgeous in his rybes of office the
Arch Priest sat upon the Torn, and,
upon  the black stone altar stood a
beautiful girl, glittering with jewels
and a crown of golc, who had been
chosen by lot from the fairest of the
land, and kept in ignorance of her
doom-proud to- be so honored, and
smiling happily. Suddenly, the Arch
Priest arose aid bound her hands and
feet with silken cords, and laid her on-
the altar, but she did not see even
then the faggots and, 'the gleaming
crystal club that lay beside her.
Then among the princes, head and
shoulders above them, strode the gray-
haired Amasis, and told them, as often

them cease front blood. But this they
deemed the Magian's madness, so they
humored it, and asked hint to show
them this ling who was so long in
coming to hig right!.
Heeding not the sneer, .but pointing
through a rift in the clouds, that till
now had hid the sure, his reply rung
out so all could hear and tremble:
" Behold, the Light you Worship is
turning to darkness !"  very glance
Was upward and, throu h the rent pa.,
Vilion of the dying sun, for a moment
caught the fearful sight, ere the clouds
lolled back again
Rage and terror seized the multi-
tade. They inade a wild rush toward
the spot where he stood, calm and
steadfast, shouting : "It is the unbe-;
lieVer's work. Let the sacrifice go
on !'' -But the mother of the girl, who

was arrayed for slaughter, had been
closely scanning the line of maidens,
and now her ' shrill cry was heard
above the tumult : "ilold! Where is
the Magian's Daughter ?"
Aye, where?    Up in her father's
tower, whither the unwonted hum of
voices had drawn her, she gazed in
a razement on the- - thousands that
thronged the plains below, till the
white beard and long 'snowy locks of
Amasis, standing like a rock amidst
the seething mob, fixed her wandering
eyes. When they rushed upon him,she
flew ~down the slope and over the
green terraces to share his danger
Again that mother's cry : "Where
is the Magian's Daughter ?' And the
Arch Priest descended the stone stairs
that led from the altar to the plain to
stay the tumult, but before they could

outstretched arms of Amasis, saying:
" What means it, my father ?" But he
only said: "Be strong, my daughter!'
Then spoke the Priest : .I' Do hom-
age,. Aida !.before Ahriman. "  " The-
Lord I worship," she answered, "crea-
ted both the light and the darkness."
But he pitied her, and .felt the
charm of her wondrous beauty and he.-
roic, spirit. In his softest accents he
to~d her what the day demanded, and
how little a thing it was to escape so
dire a penalty. Thel effort was vain.
Again he addressed her aloud:  " Do
homage, Aida ! or take her place -who
waits to be offered."
And Amasis whispered : "Be strong,
my daughter."   Clear were the tones
in which- her answer came: "The
Lord, I worship can raise me from
the dead.". At that the people cried
out with the roar, of the raging sea

"To the altar with the Magian's
daughter."
Sadly the Arch Priest bore her up
the mountain, and Amasis followed up
the stone steps, down which ere long
sprang the unbound maiden, jeweled
and crowned and, shuddering at the
fate she fled from, to. join her kind-
red.
In her stead lay Aida, elad in her
simple robe of white, with clasped
hands, and still as the picture of a
saiut. The Priest bound her not, for
his pity had grown to love, and he
was determined to save her even then,
though her glazing eyes beheld him
standing by her side with the instru-
inent of death upraised and waiting
the re-appearance of the sun. But f r
him and his heathen clan it wo d
never shine again.

throwing strange unnatural hues on
all things-on .the grass, and the sky
and the row silent populace, who each
looked on the other's face affrighted.
The air was heavy and unstirred save
by puffs of stifling vapor. The, very
ground wavered, and from everywhere
came rumbling echoes, as of chariots
-thundering over rock-ribbed moun-
tains, and dashing together above the
banded stars.
Then   from  the  Torn,  Amasis
stretched out his arm toward the brok-
en clouds, and cried aloud: "The
King cometh!" and lo.! there in the
zenith hung the sun, black and form-
lese. The crowd saw, and crouched,
and moan in object horror. Light

the hill was split in twain, and the fire
temple crashed down the chasm that
ran northward to the Lake and south-
ward to the Atlantic.   The panic
stricken crowd fought for re -in to

barriers, and swept over the city of
Cam, along the granite-hewn Pali-
sades the earthquake had builded, on
to the astonished ocean. Amasis on-
ly survived, kneeling on the Torn
mountain beside the form of his dead
daughter, while the   evening sun
threw its wonted rays orer a changed
-land and a new river. On the night
of the second day, weary with watch-
ing, the old man slumbered, but when
the dawn came Aida waked him, and

made this answer to his waking eyes:
"  y spirit was afar where all the
worlds rolled by in glory, save our
earth that reeled through space black
and monstrous. Then a glare of con
tral fires, leaping an instant through
her shattered crust, showed me a rab-
ble throng howling round a cross
whereon hung nailed our King."
The old man wept. "He has risen,"
she exultingly exclaimed, as if she
caught a str in of seraphic song. "Go
hence, my fa:he', and tell men now
sacrifice is sacrilege, but let me stay
with the Angels."
And so he left her, retracing his
way to the Pacific. But the cause..
way was gone. The earthquake -had
sunk the Isthmus and nnlinked the
Hemisphere, that the new world might
not bear the guilt of the old. Then he
journeyed  southward to the   gold-

his message, with what avail, who

centuries, the Spaniards came, amid
the ruins of an earlier civilization t1ey
found there a race that offered "human
sacrifices, and a wondrous temple sa-
cred to the sun, on whose pictured

As ifi'Lwere loath to leave
So fair a paradise."
Together they would urge their po-
nies along the mountain road, or
climb South Beacon- from whence four
states help make the landscape; but
their favorite haunt was her arbor on
the river bank, where, when too late
to read, they could gaze silently n
the reflected radiance of the hill-
crowned village opposite, or
The moving lights that hung from the spars,
And mingled below with the shadows of stars.
So these summer days rolled by
as the others had done, with never
a word of betrothal spoken, yet Guert
Brickerhoff looked forward to; his
nearly reached majority, when he
would take her to his home a willing
bride. Proud of the'homage paid her
by Paul Vernon, his noble nature had
no room for a jealous thought, and
though   acknowledging superior ac-

25

complishments in his rival his honest
heart did not deign to fear them.--
Perhaps .his mistress would have pre-
ferred a little more sensibility. At
times, not an angel but a woman; she
could not . resist the temptation to
playful coquetry ; and the Rector's
eyes brightened at a fancied interest,
in his eloquence over what she be-
stowed on the young Squire's homely
wit and humor. Neither lover having
declared himself, of course, she rea-
soned her maidenly duty was non-in-
tervention. But deep down in her
heart was a wealth of affection she
was all unconscious of, for the friend
of- her youth-- needing only some
crisis in her life, such as came to her
ere long, to cpll it forth spontaneous-

Just then contrasting strangely with-
the whiteness all around appeared the
sable face of Quawm,au ancient servitor
who .had come out to care for the
horses.
" Will Massa Brinkerhoff have the
harness off ?" he whispered through
his gleaming ivories,
"No, Quawm! only throw their
their blankets on, we will start in a
few moments, Dominie you had better
go too. In   multitude of escorts
there may be safety." But Paul only
shook his head as they entered the
presence of the object of their idola'
story, whom they found gloved and
bonneted, glowing with health and
gleeful over her long talked of sleigh
ride " up tp the Paltz."_

No one hinted to her a word of dan-

the bear-skin robe around her, feet be-

had been making mysterious signs to

beach he watched them; then out on
the river till far in the North, the
speck vanished from the ice plain.
Wearily passed that long remember--
ed day. Some weird presence seemed
warning him of peril. In vain would
he check the thought as folly, as he
lay down one book to take up another.
His favorite authors had lost th4ir
charms, for his heart was away to the
northward where Guert was pressing
his suit at last with words of open
frankness, and his fair companion
studying' how the could retain her
freedom yet a little longer. A suspiq
eion that it might be so, did not tend
to quiet Paul's restlessness. The last

fastened greedily oil a little item that
spoke of " much floating ice in the
North River, just above the city."--
Then he blamed himself for his former
lingering and uncertain mode of gain-
ing the hand of her he loved so long ;
else he might have had the right to have
dissuaded her from the fascinating ride,
and kept her to himself to-day.
Ever and anon turning his wistful
glances where his thoughts were, in
- the hops that they might, have taken
counsel of their fears, and turned
back before their journey's end ; at
last he mounted his horse to ride away-
from his anxiety.  But a few miles
down the Breakneck road he saw and
heard enough to make him hasten
home and take "to his skates, if so, he
might meet them miles above on their
return, and warn Guert off the river.
Below he could hear the low roar and

dull crashing of the channel ice, and
even where he skated the places that
had yesterday been only dangerous,
*     were now black pools, and as far as
he, could see, there were ominous fis-
sures crossing and re-crossing each.
other. But he pressed on till the twi
light had.,gone. The moon would not
rise in an hour. His peril was more
imminent than theirs, and only the
thought, that she might be lost whom
he could have saved, and the joy of
his life go out forever, kept him stead-
ily on his course-
"Who falls from all he knows of bliss
Cares not into what abyss."
And well was it for -the returning
travellers that Paul Vernon kept on.
The moonlight, when it came, did not
discover to his searching gaze, a soul
moving over the wide expanse ; but
presently a tinkling sound was borne

on thy rising wind. Ile listened.-
Loader floated their merry jingling,
and thea around a beetling headlaud
that had hid then, at full trot dashed
the unsuspecting greys. He shouted,
though he knew their master could
not hear him, and when he did they
were almost upon him.
"Why Dominie Vernon ! as I live,
cried Guert " where are you going ?
where have you been ? you look as
pale as a ghostin the moonlight."
"You would be pale too, Guert
l3rickerhoff, if you had been as 'near
the bitterness of death as I have.-
Thank God ! I am in time to hope
to save you Mary."
" Oh, Mr. Vernon, is it so bad?"
replied she, " get is the sleigh and tell
us what you mean. Stop Guert !" the
greys stood a moment.
" No. I will noi add my weight,"

Laid the Rector; "BErinkerhoffi! you
need all your horses speed to get do  
to some point where    yQu can go
ashore."
" Well that is some distance, -you
had better get in," said Guert, who
was always last to own a risk. -
No, no, hasten!" almost angrily
cried Vernon, "I will pilot you. The
river is open below the highlands, and
a great wall .of broken ice was piled-
up there this afternoon, and if that
gives way when the tide turns, the
whole mass will move from Peliham
Cove; if it has not already-"
Away sprang the horses in Vernon's
vake, whose fears added wings to his
flight. But the youth and "Maiden were
happy still ; p riect love) casteth out
fear; only an hour heforo they had given
themselves to each other for all time and
.for ever. . But slowly and surely as

the. morn mounted the sky, the fateful
crisis was approaching them, and when
miles below' they saw  the glitter of
its beams, their short dream   Avaw
rudely br.;ken. It could not be the
ice they said that shone so, for on it
there was snow. No, it must be a
sheet of water where the ice had gone
out or sunk suddenly, and then the
full, meaning of Paul's warning burst
upon them.
The strange celebrity with w hieh
nature works this change on her great
highway must be seen to be realized ;
one may pass over the solid bridge at
night, where on the morrow ho can-
not walk but by a miracle.
On flew their guide ; on sped the
greys as if conscious that the race
was for life. Already the dim o tline
of the shore, where they coil4 land,
was visible. They could. aLmost count

the scattered house lights, that never
before had looked more welcome ;
when suddenly a mighty goar smote
their ears, and turning instinctively,
they saw a, fast widening line behind
them, winding like a huge serpent,
black nnd glittering to the northwards
The channel. ice had given why above
and beside theme
But they were on the eastern flats;
and now heading for the shore over
uglier cracks than  Guert had   ever
tempted, he hoped to reach it-before
the quivering ijiass swing loose from
its moorings. All at once, the horses;
with a neigh of fright, broke from his
control.  The ice field was moving,
aad some subtle sense told them what
in ended. Before them was a fissure
wider than could be leapt ver, and
growing every moment'
Quick to see the new peril, Paul

grasped the bit as they rushed by, and
hung on desperately till Guert had
iime to. cut the traces ; then let them
plunge untrammelled into the yawning
gulf, and take their chance for life.
The young men watched them
struggle over to the firmer ice, but
whether they made sure their foot-
ing, they cQuld not tell, through the
dim increasing distance. Wider grew
the chasm!. Their last faint hope of
being, carried against some jutting
point, was lost. The tide had changed.
It was running out, and bearing them
downward:indeed, but further from the
shore. The. noie of the nyassive cakes
grinding, against each other grew ter-
rible. Their frail float was fast -fail-
ing. Great pieces broke ofd it above
and below; and. when they a4 reach-
ed the bay, wind aid  tide impelling,
it-was so small they could see the ire

heaving, crashing, whirling around
them.
So they floated, looking death in the
. face, till opposite the home of Mary
Pell. Its peace so near her, and yet
so far ; she, who had  been  calm
through all, sobbed wildly, stretching
out her hands toward that lone light
which waited for her, and dal!ing for
some one to come. None could hear,
and no boat could have lived to reach
them through that seething surge.-
But the deep voice of Vernon reciting
from the Litany  "And from sudden
death, good Lord deliver u's," recalled
her; and to him she spoke:
" Forgive me, Paul! I could not
help loving Guert more than you,
though I hardly knew it till to-day.-
Pardon me the sorrow."
"Peace to you Mary!" said the Rec-
tor slowly, " Guert has told me what

39
my own heart would feign deny. And
to show you I forgive, let me, as he
wishes unite you with holy words-
not till death do you part-but that
sinking in each others arms you may
awake one."
And'it' was done.
Then all was calm again throughout
the little company that seemed to stand
in the very shadow of doom.    The
beauty of the, solemn rite had with-
drawn their minds from their awful
surroundings, and  they   felt new
strength to die.
Paul was the first to . reak the short
silence.  "took ! what is that dark
spot ahead ?"
"A pile of rock-almost in the mid-
die of the river," Guert replied, ".and
it will either save or ruin us." True,
there it lay directly in their course,
and would either hatter their brittle

Guert, and before the eddy-had whirled

Only this one of her reminiscences,
relating to the Newburgh    letters,
comes back to me now.
.I never, mever saw the General
more moyed in spirit, said she, though
in more fitting wordsthan once when I
happened on a visit at the house of a
leading patriot with whom he was
most intimate. It was when the ar-
my lay in-camy near New Windsor, a
few miles above West Point. Prelimi-
nagryterms of peace had bee settled,
and the situation of many of the offi-
cers was desperateo   The empty,
promises of Congress could not replace
their expended patrimonies, and they
felt that;to be set adrift on the world,
penniless, was hardly what their seven
years service to the Republic merited.

49
In the midst of the tinder some un-
known hand hulled a fire brand-a let-
ter eloquent enough for Junids to have
written, and insiduous enough to have
emanated from the club of the Jaco-
bins. Simultaneously -came a call
for them to meet at the Temple. This
was- a building the General, who had
been made a Mason at Morristown,
erected to serve the double purpose pf
a church for the army, and a lodge-
room for the fraternity of officers.
I know Masonry has been a terror to
this generation, but the favor he felt
for it has always been for me its best
defence. Once, I remember, a poor
wretched, ragged man came to our
house and after a private interview
with my brother, went away well clad,
and with a purse of gold in his pocket.
No one told me this was Masonry, but

-           All this is wandering from the letter
the General read from.    When he
came to. the passage where the writer
urges his brother officers to tell Con-
gress "that in any event the army has
its alternative. If peace, nothing shall
separate you from your arms but death;
if war, that courting the auspices and
inviting the directions of, your illus-
trious leader, you will retire to some
unsettled country, smile in your turn
and mock when their fear cometh,"
he paused.   What."! he exclaimed,
pacing the floor "must this imprudent
schemer have me to head his conspira-
cy ?" Then mastering his indignation
he added, "If there is to be one, per-
hays it is better that I should !"

out a Protestant Republic. The fleets
of England were bearing down on its
coasts, the. armies of France were
marching on its capital, and the ban-
ner of St Bartholomew cast its blood-
red shadow before them.     But the
man for the, hour had come. His
strong heart kept beat with the gran-
deur of the time. The ocean was his
only ally; and after it had beaten off
the English ships, he called it to his aid,
till it flowed over half the provinces
and helped defend the rest, And where
this wall of water. did not reach he
built a wall of patriotic hearts. The
masses caught his spirit. The Burgh-
ers knew his power. Old men told
how his sires had broken off their
necks the cruel yoke of Spain, and
fair womern, with the cool heroism of
the sex, played up the hands of the
Chieftain.

All the world deemed the contest
hopeless, but staking'his honor, rank
and life upon the issue, with the bloom
of youth upon his cheek, and ancestral
glories clustering thick about his name,
he strode into the front ranks of war.
Louis the Great, and the flower of the
French chivalry were there, but he
held them  at bay.  Nor could the
bribe of a crown tempt him, nor the
gigantic power of France drive him
from the stand he had taken, as long
as there remained a ditch to die in.-
Thus he battled on along for weary
years,. untiLthe Germanic States, be-
coming conscious of their danger, one
by one wheeled into line, and came up
to the help of the free against the
mighty, and when the tide of invasion
rolled back, there stood unshaken
and unbroken, those two strong pillars

of civilization, the Nationality of Hol-
land and the Protestant faith.
On that height of glory he might
willingly have died. A life of eight
and twenty summers so filled w'th pa-
tient effort, and crowned by such sub-
lime achievement would have towered
above all human lives before, and all
that have been since, save his whose
fame brightens in th e gaze of humani-
ty, "like some golden mountain top
where dwell the spirits of the dawn."
He was the type of the coming Wash-
ington.
Thus born a Stuart ; afterward wed-
ded to a Stuart and 'oiled to fill the

down with

They crowded the deck of the sinliing wreck

Intent on the goal of a heroic Soul,

suggested Bute, who still thought of
them as schooA-girls he could hardly

bine, 'they entered the hospitable doors

the young men flung themselves, and
read and dozed away the afternoon till
the dressing bell roused them to meet
the family, who welcomed them with
the  unaffected  cordiality of Auld
Lang Syne.

the shortest of their lives. The Hours

the next the rock road ring with gai&amp;
loping hoofs, as they tempted the nar
row causeway between Breakneck and
the river. One night it would be mu^

social- gathering where every other

was yet more misty.       "Were either
dear charmer away !" then Cave or
Bate would     have been    away   along
with the charmer; but the sisters were
inseparable.
One evening the couples, as far
apart as they could get, were leaning
against the snowy walls of the piazza,
watching the glassy Bay mirror back
the moon, when Bute broke out with :
0, scenes there are of beauty in this desert
world-of ours,
Oases-like, all redolent of fountains and of flow-
ers!f
Where the lonely heart forgetting o'er its exiled lot
to grieve
In their lovely presence findeth an Eden and an
Eve.
" Really, Mr. Eveleth ! that verse
seems to fascinate you.    It's only the
second time you have whispered it to
me to-night !" said Vinia.
" Oh !" blundered Bute, "I thought
it was your sister"


72 -
"Indeed! Your flattery is so general
then it means nothing in particular."
CaveColton could not help hearing,
and making a pQint:
Say, Bute ! it never struck me
before how lucky Adam was in not -
having two Eves to choose from in
Paradise.
But the girls who had no such
trouble, pondered these things in their
hearts.
So 'autumn days swept by, and the
visit they had lengthened,. to escort
Tavia and Vinia to New York, ended
without a declaration, save what. they
made to each other of finding their
fate on the voyage. Sloops were yet
the common carriers of the time, and
Cap'n Boam was. never prouder of
Periauga than when it carried the
partie earree out to the "Hope" that lay
at anchor off the Bar,-aw ng ac txurn

of the tide, or a whiff of tho\wind,
till after sunset.
Leaning over the taffrail in the
moonlight, as the bounding bark dash-
ed over the mountain shadows, and
almost alone on deck, each felt the
day of decision had come and gaily
accepted the position.  Their tones
lowered perceptibly and by degrees
the pairs of chairs instinctively separ-
ated.  Bute's proposal was on his
tongue and Tavia seemed ready for
the question, when the Master sang
out to the helmsman: "How far down
are we ?"
" St. Anthony's Nose, sir !"
The sight 'of the monster by moon-
light was too rare to be missed, and
woman's curiosity broke up each tete
.a tee, to -gaze upon the wonderful
mountain, on whose misshapen side
that strange irregularity was carved by

nature men called so from time imme-
morial.
" Quite a prominent feature !" Cave
remarked.
"And do look ! Mr. Colton,".cried
Tavia, "at that twig growing down
where his chin ought to be."
" Rather to  Frenchy for a Saint's
beard-goate    gh !"
But while they were cracking their
jokes on the rock, a bend in the river,
dispelled the allusion, and Bute walk-
ed away with number nine, beginning
.again the same strain he~had just left
off with number eight, till he caught,
himself in. time to change' the subject,-
by hinting that it was past their," hour
for retiring."  The. opportunity, thus
lest,' did notuecur on:the- passage. A
fair wind all next day carried them
past the Palisades, and late in the af-
ternoon  the ;young .nn left their

tharges at the house of, the friend they
had come to visit, on St. John's Park,
as free as ever.
fThe "Lady of the Lake" was.the
play of the period, and on the'evening
after, lute happened to take Vinia and
Cave the other,; wherein the the
"Lady" was so large, and the skiff so
little, the sisters were not the only ones
in the old Chatham Theatre who shud-
dered at the consequences.   Home
again, in their room that overlooked
the inchoate Park, they were wonder-
ing if their knights would get out of
their maze, and to their satisfaction;
while at the City Hotel the knights were
sketching a new campaign entirely.
" By  the bye ! Colton !. did you
earry the day with Miss Vinia ?" asked
Bute, after they had pulled the play-
ers' costumes .to 'pieces.


76
" I should, had not St. Anthony
flanked us at the crisis," Cave replied,
who suspected more than he knew."
"You may well say 'us,' ha ! ha !"
laughed Bute.
- "Have you determined which num-
ber to take, Eveleth ?"
"I thought I had till last night."
"So did I," pointedly replied Cave,
jumping up to light an Havannah, and,
hide his blushes.
" My plan is," suggested Bute, "to
return with then to-morruw, and at
sight of the Nose, ask the gone that
happens to be with us,, instanter"
"So be it! lHope the name is not
ominous of the answers we'll get."
"After what has passed I should
not wonder if both refused us !" :
" ela depend on which one we ask."
" We must follow our own hearts,"
said Bute, "but whose knows ?"

" St. Anthony's, sir !"  And so they
- settled it, little thinking what a revenge
for their jests the saint was going to
have when they would read their fate
by lightning.
Storm and headwinds so delayed the
upward trip, that in the third day's
twilight the sloop lay by for the night
as her four passengers thought, below
the highlands. But after midnight
the wind shifted, and spite of their
lack of ballast, and the warnings of
the helmsman, the venturesome master
weighed anchor.
Through the perils of that winding
gorge, where at every turn the moun-
tains make a new channel for the wind
and the water, the vessel had nearly
passed, when all at once strange noises
overhead roused Cave and Bute from
their slumber. Climbing   up  with
coats in hand, they leaped into tho

darkness.   Iheir floating hone wag
shaking in the whirl of the teinpest.-"
Then a flash- from  the clouds showed
them the man, whose place was the
tiller, knocked overboard and swims
ming for the shore, and the pale nas-
ter with his axe, on deck alone, by the
great white sheet that strained and
strugged for release.
The next moment they were all in
the water, with the spread sail undei
them like a hammock. The " Hope '
had capsized.  The pent up winds
came pouring. through the narrows,
an4 there she lay without the slimmest
hope of righting. Bt the ,master
slinging to his ax,), as if it Were a life
preserver, clambered up on the side,
and lifted them out of the reach of
the waves, to take their chances with
the vessel'

' All this time the, sisters were in the
after cabin, and their angels had taken
their souls -for a little while, when the
dream changed to falhng down, down,
down, till they awoke in terror, stand-
ing on the wall of their state room.-~
Through the chinks of the door under
their feet, that was locked on the out-
side, the water came flowing in, and
they could hear it surging through the
hold. Butthey could see nothing, and
.half awake, could not tell in their
fright, whether their side of the sloop
was the upper or under. Shut in, and
shrieking aloud'from that dark coffin ;
even in those perilous moments Vinia
noticed Tavia called on Bute to save
her, and it made her glad as she
thought they would die as they had
lived, without a cloud between their
spirits.. So clasped in each others
arms, and praying, silently they waited.

Then over their heads rolled a noise
thatvwas not thunder. They listened,
and catching the sound of heavy strokes
knew eome some one was cutting them
out of ,their prison. Steadily fell the
axe, every time with a clearer ring,
till the cool air rushed in and told them
they were rescued from that horror.
Ere long strong arms lifted them out
. into the grateful' gloom, and . manly
tones -cheered them  back to hopeful-
ness.
The wreck was sinking slowly and
the small boat hadbeen swept away, but.
the river was calm again and daylight
not far distant. Wrapped in shawls and
blankets, Tavialet Bute support her, and
Vinia the other, as they sat on the ves-
sol's side, wishing for the morning.--
So floating up with the tide and look-
ing shoreward, suddenly with a crash
and a roar the sky was lit for a mo-

81
ment, and there right before them
towered the frowning front of St. An-
thony. Then the.young men remem-
bered their strange compact, but there
was no need. That hour of peril had
stilled all doubts and fears forever.
With the dawn came the welcome
sight of"Perryauger" bearing down up-
on them from the northward. The
escaped boatman had given the alarm,
and fearing the worstCapt'n Boan.and
Massey, who would come along, apt
proached the wreck. When they saw
the "Hope's" company still afloat the
hills  resounded  with  their loud
huzzas, and Massey hugged all that
came aboard indiscriminately.
"Number eight and number nine
will have to be called something else
before long, I guess, haw! haw !" and
her red turban shook as she looked
at the blusling sisters.

June brought its wedding wreaths of
roses, .and as the bridal party stood
under the shade of the elm again, Ta-
via said looking at Bute:  "I shall
never forget that glimpse we had of
the Nose !"
"The print is on my brain." replied
Vinia, "what are you men laughing
at -"
" Why the fact is," said Bute, "our
ladies' ayes were too prominent a fea-
ture of that occasion to leave room for
any such impression."
" Of course they were !" added Cave,
"I don't remember any Nose at the
time you speak of, my dear, but St.

A BALLAD OF AULD SCOTLAND,
There is now no Laird of Iasa and the Royal Isle of

O'er the ctmbling castle turrets flocks of shrieking
sea gulls fly,                       d,

who silent lie
Around Dunvegan.
Once the chieftain of the islands, reigned the

guard the bhore
Along Dunvegan.
While the silken flag above them, which the fairies'
fingers wove,
From the colors of the heather and the foliage of
the grove,
Made their numbers seem to foeman thrice as
many when they strove
Far from Dunvegan.
On its warp and woof of.beauty, HOLD 'AST, we e
the words inwrought;
:And amid the wars of ages-where e'er Highlander
have fought,
Memory of that Gaelic banner gave them valor,
when they thought
Of old Dunvegan.
I have heard a tragic legend, of those mad, tempes-

And a measure more heroic than these easy flowing

About Dunvegan.

Caring naught for prince or pirate, from the world
Eahfall many a mile,
Each new generation holding prouder, bitterer hate
the while         Against Dunvegan,
' But a beam of light and beauty came to earth with
Fantasole-*
Only heir and only daughter, singing, swinging Ori-

And her lather's brow grew brighter, like the hills,
when shadows roll    Over Dunvegan.
Music floating o'er the' water, laughter dying. in a
sigh,
Falling from the rocks above him as he rowed his
curra nigh
Where she sang, one day bewildered Alexatder
Prince of Skye,
Aid of Dunvegan.
Won, he waited. Down a pathway leading to the
ocean strand,
Tripped the maide1w, with her tresses, golden tinted,
in her hand,
And her great eyes looking thro' the hazy distance
toward the land
Where stood Dunvegan.
So upon the narrow causeway Fantole stood
dreamily ,
Heedless of the tide returning, and the wild re-
morseless sea,
Till it swept netween her Island, and where still
in fancy, she
Was at Dunvegan.
Turning then her glances shoreward, pale with fear
.her head she bowed ;
"Save me ! Save me I or I perish," half in prayer
she shrieked; and loud

it bore her faint,
Hair al streaming-hands close clasping--like the
picture of a saint ;
But the look with whieh her father spake the
words, 0, who can paint?
" Welcome, Dunvegan I"
'Twas not long ere Alexander to the Isle of Igg
again,
Came a-wooing, in a grander state, with oars six-
teen and men ;
Never heart beat more chivalric, nor shone sun
more bright than when
He left Dunvegan.
Still the old Laird was so courtly-better had he
been as trite !
And the best cheer of the castle gave him, till the
day was through-
Fantasole--and smiling called bcr, when at eve
they said adieu,
"Queen of Dunvegan"
Never rose a wraith to warn him, with his heart so
o    free from guile,
H~ow the spirit of betrayal entered into Igg the
while,
Come again, incarnate lurking underneath the kiss
and smile.
Beware ! Dunvegan. -
On the shore his boat lay oarless, every sailor firm.
ly bound,
And the old Laird set his helpless guest adrift upon
the sound ;
So all night and day they floated on the ocean,
round and round.
Their home, Dunvegan.

the grim decree :

While her azure eyes were fraught
With a look that spoke her heart,

by escapades, only pardoned to beauty
and eccentricities credited to genius.
An orphan from childhood, she had
come to be looked upon in the manner
of a file du regiment-a daughter of
the Institute-whom people no more
thought of holding to the stern code
of. decorum, than old Patsy, the ebon
cook, to the strictest rules of graceful-
ness.
One must see Patsy, in the minds
eye, to feel the force of the figure.-
Of a darkness that shone, and almost
as broad as long,- her weight was so
elephantine, that to crack the ice for
dinner, the girls said she only need
step on the cleaver. Owing to her
build it was easy enough to laugh be-
hind her back, but few dared face her
angry, and she was about the only
part of the'institution Oily Romar had
ever stood in awe of. Once the spirit

of mischief -possessed some- of the
boldest to enjoy a contraband -eupper
of watermelons. Such tables are not
wont to be burdened with luxuries,
and -there was a pining for the juicy
fruit they had espied in a neighboring
garden. After the house was still one
moonlight night, it was but a moment's
work for Oly- and -a confederate to
sally forth and return well laden to
meet their fellow-plotters in the dining
room. The talk was in a whisper,
and- the plates were- muffled with nap-
kins. Their laughter had got to be,
not loud, but deep, - and stolen fruit
never tasted sweeter, when, suddenlyy
emerging -from her dark domain, Patsy
glowered upon them, clothed on with
robes and cap of gh stly whiteness.
Before that wierd preseuce what won-
der panic ieied the rev llers.

Speaking never a *ord, with arms
akimbo, there she stood, the imperson,
ation of insulted kitchendom, -till tho
knives dropped froin nerveless fingers,
and. one by' one the culprits stole noise
lessly away. Of all, only Olly stayed,
to finish her repast, and then carving
a huge piece,. of luscious redness, beg-
ged the uninvited guest to drown her
ire in its liquid coolness. A idaoity so
sublime, met'no repulse, an the temp-
tation no resistance.   Th's double
stroke there was no witlstan ing, and
ever after a- strange compact seemed
to unite these antipodes, by which the
sins of" the one were shielded, and the
face of .the other lightened with a love
for the motherless child, and a lively
-interest in all her fortunes.
At times a crishing sense of her
loneliness would come to the orphan,
fir her lite wa.,Aot all'sunshine,' and

in the cloudy days she could not for-
get how unprotectedd she really was,
without a relative in the wide world,

graces of a struck position. But with
a laugh and a glance all these were
thrown aside for one -she could not
scan too often nor prize too tenderly.
She had. had it since seventeen, with
every now- and then a letter from the
original, who was her Guardian.'
- There' was not so much difference
between their agee as- this relation
would seem to indicate. Erle Pentz
was scarcely thirty, and a lithe form
and features-of sanguine temperament
gave him the look ofone stillyounger.
Added - to his native oomeliness and
and ease of manner, was the polish
caught from 'the highest social life in
his southern home, and long residence
on 'the continent. His very smile was
captivating, and his gentle -deference
to woman:- repossessed the- merest
stranger inhis favor.

97
One morning as the corps of school
girls dragged its length along, on its
return, Olly shocked the pro prieties
by rushing out of the racks and shak-
ing hands with a passer by, who hard-
ly recognized her, though his after
glance of admiration made full amends
for his first want of recollection. The
teacher in charge looked on in dumb
amaze, till Erle Pentz by a polite re-
quest, which had all the force of a
command, brushed away, every trace
of embarrassment:    "Madam! your
most obedient. My ward seems in-
stinctively to seek the protection of her
guardian. If you please we will fob
low  after."     Ah   certainly, Mr.
Pentz," she replied your rights are
paramount."
So your memory was better than
mine, Miss Romar," he said, as they
fell'to the rear.

"Oh !'.' you have not changed as
much as I," replied Olly, while the
thought of her daily study of his fea-
tures deepened the rose-tints.
" No, you have become a butterfly
since I saw you." -
" What an ugly chrysalis I must
have been, really," she laughed.
"Ydu translate the type too literal-
ly," said he. "Do not carry.it either
forward or backward. A thing of
beauty should be a joy forever:"
+ Just then her attention was all ab-
sorbed, watching the yacht coming up
before the wind, to which she pointed
admiringly. "Oh! yes,"said he "that is
the way we came, Fay and I, to cruise
around here for a few days; and he
is letting the morning breezes. blow
the cob webs from his brain, his misty
old books have left there. He has
just taken orders. You must let me

he shall have us for passengers some
afternoon."
"Do br'. him the next time you
come.   'WoA. t you stop now ?" she
said as th reached the steps of the
portico, and he lifted his kat.
" I have not.time to-day, but give
any respects to the po wers that be, and
tell them I am coming to take you for
n drive to-morrow," and so he left her
with a little flutter in the heart, for
the first time stirred from its maidenly
repose.
Sails and drives followed each other
in quick succession, sometimes with
Mr. Fay, but oftener without him, till
Erie's "few days" had legthened to a
fortnight. The Madame vainly hinted

the regulation hour for retiring. At
last she spoke out: "This will neher,
neber do, Miss Oily ! What you sup-
pose Missus say if -she knew how lato
you are to-night ?"
"Now Patsy! don't be cross;" she
pleaded, " if we hadn't missed the
road we should have been home long
ago."
"Lost the :road, eh ! if you don't
take care you'll lose your heart next,

"You wont tell will you? he wants
to be my guardian always," whispered
the maiden with an arch look over her
shoulder, and tripping lightly to her
room.      .
"IUh ! what does she want for to
go marry that southerner? and her
guardian too" the old woman mumbled,
as she softly locked the doors, "there's

101
a law against it, or there ought t" be."
The next day broke. balmy and
beautiful, as was meet for the longest
of the year, and Oily was up with the
sun, looking over her treasures, and
selecting a gala costume, so carefully
her room-mate rallied hez. But this
was the last afternoon the yacht would
lie in those waters, and Erle had told
her to wear her jewels, and they would
spend on board their -last hour togeth-
or, if she decreed it so. She aske n
reason ; indeed, perhaps she half 1 n-
derstood what he meant, and his wish -
os were laws to her already.
They remembered afterward how
restless she was all that day, laughing
and crying by turn,, and when the
shadows began to lengthen, wistfully
watching for the yacht's flag. At last

ing the young men just as they sprang
ashore to fasten the bowline. An old
boatman on the wharf shook his head
looking at the sky, and tried to dis-
suade them from putting out, but they,
only laughed at his fears, and Olly had
none, or lost them in her happiness,
before the village spires vanished in
the distance. Watching the west that
gleamed like a sea of molten gold,
she sat by Erle who held the tiller,
-ani the hand h was praying 1b; her
heart he knew he had already.
So, lazily, the yacht beat about where
their faney turned or the light breeze
wafted it, till the twilight deepened
and the evening star hung over the
horizon. Mr. Pay lay forward, with
his dap over-his eyes, smoking, as if

In that soft ani mullow light there

Erle ceased his earnest pleadings.
All nature seemed soothed to silence,
and no one roared to break the spell by
speaking of return. But while they
were dreaming ominous clouds had
covered the eastern  sky, and now
white caps of foam crested the waves.
The sail flapped before the moaning of
the coming tempest. A shroud of
gloom fast closed around, almost hid-
ing them from each other. Quick as
thought they made ready for the shock,
and hardly before the squall ,struck
and passed over them. For a moment
their little craft trembled in the grasp
of the gale, but staunchly rode it out,
with no loss save the signal lamp,
which the wind shivered.

ness still surrounded thei,all the wind
died away, and there, without a light,
they floated in the very, path of every
passing steamer. It seemed the cloud
never would lift, when suddenly the
shrill whistle sounded close upon them,
and soon they could hear the splash-
ing of the great wheels, and the cleav-
ing of the water. Rumbling through
the gloom ahead tie noise of ponder-
ous strokes they could, count drowned
tue young men's shouting. The sense
of their weakness crushed, and the
awe of that unseen but certain danger
almost maddened them. Louder grew
the beats that steadily measured their
minutes. Then out of the darkness
glared the headlight like the burning
eye of a Cyclops. The ^monster was
bearing right down upon them.  Its
breath f flame lit luridly the mass of
mist and cloud ; and its huge breast

bored to reach and annihilate them.
During those perilous moments Olly
Romar, with her hand in Erle's, still
as a statue and as pale too, must have
lived a lifetime  Nearer and nearer it
came, till with one last long skriek of
despair, they stgod in helpless horror
watching the fate that swept across
the water. Then the pilot must have
heard, for sheering off a little, with a
flash and a roar, the thumping, hissing
flaming thing crashed by, so close they
could almost touch its sides, and left
them breathless.
That terrible tension gone from her
nerves she flung herself into his arms
sobbing : "When will you take me
home, to your home, Erle ?"

marked with the ,prints of ruthless
fingers. The footsteps on the ploughed
ground were single, and by the fence
was the track of 'a wagon's turning.

friends to come and claim their dead
and they. came from every quarter,
looking for the missing of the last Do-
eade. The intense excitement, in a
country village, where .gossip over a
neighbor's wife or horse will draw a
group of eager listeners may be ima-
gined. Day after day "  it grew by

what it fed upon," as the poor clay
was claimed for a lost darling, by one
and another, only at last to be disowns
ed again.
Of the thousands that gazed upon
it, the wonder was, not that some
dreamed a likeness till they found
some fatal discrepancy between fact
and fancy, but that none recognized
the waif which bore so many marks
of recent care and culture. How could
a face, so fair with lines of intellect,
thus drop ojt of life and leave no
chasm ? Every hour brought its the-
ory, but no solution of the mystery.--j
'Twas said a strange negress :had
shuddered at sight of the features, and
sobbed out a name, as she kissed the
forehead; but this rumor, like the rest
proved traceless.
Then ,just before the burial, the
case took on a phase yt t more singuv

1ar. A young woman, from some miles
away,positively identified the unknown
as her-own sister, who, seen of many,
had been living for months in the very
village .so full of wonderment. 'Marks
and molas fell in with the testimony,
and placed the fact beyond dispute'
None dissented but a portrait painter
A friend was known to have lately
driven her out in the direction of her
another's home, aut her few days' ab
pence had been thus accounted for ;
but the family knew not where she
was, until this chance look recognized
her in the stranger. On his arrest the
escort protested he had left her safe on
the road a little way from her mother's
house ;- but this only increased suspi.
cion, and amidst a storm of popular
indignation he was thrust into the
murderer's cell,, as much to save him
harmless as the najesty of the law'

X11
Not many years after from that sanie
cell a mob dragged out a negro pris-
oner, held on suspician of a lessor
crime, and left him dangling from a
court-yard tree, in. the Sunday twi-
light.
But soon there came a great. calm.
While the minister was. preaching her
funeral sermon, a physician, on his
circuit, met the missing, girl a bloom,
with vitality, visiting some other friend
meanwhile, and all unconscious of: her
sudden taken off.
" My God! Miss, they were going
to bury you this afternoon, and may-
hap the man that killed you to-mor-
row .!" he exclaimed, and lifting her in
his gig rode a race to the Town Hall,
where' shea confronted the dead and
confounded the living. Her actual
presence, in flesh and blood unmeet to
fill the others ghastly cerements, was

indisputable ; and though the rent it
made in that tissue of error, glibly
called  circumstantial evidence, her
friend passed out to freedom.'
Again the shadows settled down
thicker than ever, and rested,dark and
impenetrable over the namesless grave.
Letters and pictures, sent every now
and then for years to the officials,
brought no clue either to the actors or
the victim of the tragedy ; and it came
to be mentioned only in the MYSTERY
OF DANSKAMMEl.
III.
Yet one there was who chanced, in
the Court-room, to see. the dead girl's
gentle face, and thought she knew it;
but when so many had mistaken, it is
not strange from timidity and ignor-
ance of duty, she shrank from volun- 4

side in her simplicity, she thought
more of charging the crime upon its
author, than of linking him with it,
by establishing the identity of his vie-
tim. The name,whispered with a kiss,
was "Oily Romar !" and when ifter-
ward during the rebellion, Patsy ca-
tered for a military hospital, her belief
was turned into assurance.
The 'cots stood side by side, where-
on, twocaptive soldiers lay, whose days
were nlumbered. Of one, who, wound-
ed, led his troop :f lioe till takun

ever watching his companion while he,

seemed to have been partners in some

hold them hereafter..
Suddenly in hip delirium  the dra-

the corridor, shrieking : ' There, Fay !

"Is the war never going to end ?"
asked a buxom daughter of the Pala-
tines addressing her companion who
dwelt on the other side of the Wal-
kill, where the English element pre-
dominated.
"tAfter going on so many years it
will hardly stop of itself, Miss Nanchie
but Lord Cornwallis, I fancy,. will soon
end it to the satisfaction of 'those who
sent him," replied George Blackburn,

whose Tory fooling was so strong as to
make the course of his love run any-
thing but smooth, at times, when his
affianced thought such harranges worth
rebuke.
"Better a thirty years war as my
forefathers had at home than such
an ending !" gravely spoke Ianchie
Houslander.
"They fought for a free Conscience
'and a free Bible, and I honor them,
but this is a rebellion against the
"Protector of Faith."  Women cannot
expect. to understand these things how'
ever."
"I understand --enough, George
Blackburn,-to know .that they settled
for all time the principle of Individ-
gal Sovereignty, and so perhaps we
had better part in peace," darkly hint-=
ed the indignant damsel.
It was in the Spring, and the river

was high and rising to a freshet, as
they  rode thus discoursing. When
they had nearly reached Ward's Bridge
(whose ruins remain) he spoke to turn
her: thoughts, and wished they were
over.
"No! I wish I could always stay
on:this side," Nanchie persisted, there
are too many Tories over there and
Tories are Traitors.
Just then circumstances over which
they had no control put an end to a
dispute which might have proved dis-
astrous. Going on the bridge the wa-
ter had reached the hubs of the wheels,
but going off it rose yet higher, and
before they thought of danger, the
swift current took their horse off his
feet, and swept them down the stream.
They were yet on the flats, 'and : if the
struggling steed could be guided away

Directly she saw her lover in peril her

not think of doing,) she seized one

listeners. No one seemed to care to
go within, and all were waiting for
something--the most for the arrival of
the weddeners, and a few stern men on
the door-steps for the coming of the
Minister.
Then the farm wagon of the Hous.
landers was driven up with the bloom-

sundry  sisters;  afterward George
Blackburn dashed Among the crowd

bride in prospect, and full of visions of
the Grand "In fair" his people would
give her on the evening of the morrow.
Last of all the Priestrcame also:
Wondering at the concourse out of
doors, as  low htm  announced his
presence'  yet looking neither to the

angrily.
" It means that while the road to

A glance over the field convinced
the Dominie that discretion was the
better part of valor, and, smothering

there charms worthy of summer pi1

tribe from which it takes its name

acted that lights the rugged landscape
of the past with the glow of love and
the glare of vengeance and through
the dim legions floating around, sounds
like some story of the Grecian mould
for simple grandeur.
The time of the end had almost come
to the. trembling sway of the Mohegai
Chiefs whose broad. domain once lay
between the great rivers and reached
from the lakes to the sound. Oaill
sides the stranger race had been clos-

mountain ridges, and the upper valley
of the Kichawan, as they were wont
to name that.

Already the English Commissioners
had made them offers of removal to
those regions in the west where they
might find forests, dense as they were
made, and hunting grounds untrodden
by the foot of the Pale Face. Attimes
the warriors seemed disposed to yied
to the stern logic of events.   Then
again the thought of their ancestral
graves would overwhelm the old, and
the taunts of the women enrage the
young to swear they would never sell
their birthright.
It was a piece of delicate diplomacy,
and failure was fraught with danger.
Though decimated, they were still, nu-
merous enough, united under some
idol chieftain to carry - havoc to the
homes of the settlers and push back
for a time the out-posts of civilization.

ises, firearms and fire-water were used
unsparingly, and not without avail.
Pensioned spies among them    both
guided and revealed-their deliberations.
Of these none wielded more power
than Joliper, whose father, though of
French extraction, had kept 'his place
in the tribe, and transmitted it to his
son, who, with the blood of two races,
had the vices of both and the virtues
of neither.
ut there was one-the young Chief
of t Mahopacs-whom even he did=
not dare approach. Omoyao was every
inch a warrior, singularly courteous in
speech, sagacious in counsel,a&amp;nd no-
ble, in demeanor.
Too wary to be led, too brave to be
cowed, Joliper knew England was not
rich enough to buy him. The influ-
ence' of, such 'a character was felt
throughout the Mohegan nation, and
if the knell of their Empire had not

sounded, the, valor and wisdom  of
Omoyao might have prolonged what it
could not have preserved.
Between these two there could be nu
compromise. Such variance must ever
clash till the struggle ends in ruin to
the vanquished.   Suspected- for his
lineage, ah-eady Joliper's reputation
for loyalty had been blown upon, and
he knew he could not stand a moment
in open opposition to his popular ad-
versary. True to his instincts he set
himself to undermine what he could
not attack ; and another motive, yet
nearer his heart, urged him to add
craft to cunning. Though disgusted
with savage life and longing to throw
off his disguise, he was greedy for the
smiles of the Indian girl Maya; used
here as in the Council Chamber,
Omoyao was a bar to his wishes.
With her old father, above where

the East and West branches fbem the
Oroton, dwelt the Fleet Deer, and it
is not wonderfat she detested the one
as uch as she admired the other of
her suitors. Worthy to share the hoi
ors of the heroit chieftain, she could
buti feel loathing illbconcealed for the
crawling spy; yet conscious of his cap'
ability for she knew not what deed of
treachery, away for. the sake of her
unsuspecting lover's life, she received
him with a calm exterior.
Omayao's worship was not weak=
mess. Fleet of foot, and graceful as a
fawn by nature, the Indian taid had
seen enough of her white sisters, in
the settlement hard by her home, to
catch, . with _ woman's instinct, stray
charms of dress and manner that made
her irrisistible. Yet her love for her
people never wavered, and her faith,
that the Great Spirit would intervene

to save them from exile, never failed.
It was this sentiment, as well as the
strong grasp with Which her intellect
met his when he talked of their future
that linked their souls together.
Through all the summer negotiations
had been going on, but a strong party
swayed by the counsels of the Mohap-
oc Chief retarded and threatened to def
feat the schemes of emigration. Dai'
ly the -whites grew more anxious to
wholly possess. the land, and with it
that sense of security they never could
have while it was thus held in com-
mon. Some of the baser sort did not
scruple to say Omoyao's tongue must
be silenced, and the only obstacle left
got out of the way-by means more
likely to be foul than fair. At this
juncture it was especially desirable;

there 'were rapids and cascades, where

with a shake and the maid with a
wave of his hand, answering his cu-
rious questions about the success of
the hunting party he had left with a
semblance of that deep respect so flat-
tering to the aged. Maya had risen
to go within and leave them to their
pipes, when he prevented her with his
quavering voice:
"Will not the Fleet Deer stay to
welcome the guest, who has ridden so
far to see her whom he has loved so
long ?"
"IIf my father wishes," she said,
"but the Red Fox knows his offers of
love are, and always have been, un-
welcome."
"The Fleet Deer is sad," snared
Joliper, "for thinking.of Omoyao the

"Maya is glad; the Fleet Deer is

"Sacre !" hissed Jolipir, throwing
off his thin disguise of language as he
was 'wont: to do when angered," why
needst thou tell me this before thou
knowest even why I have returned ?"
"Maya can bear bitter tidings; let
the Red Fox speak !"
"No, they will fly fast enough,"
said Joliper, " but now let Maya listen
how she can be most happy," and whis-
pering; that the old man's doze might
continue, he pointed skyward, "when
yonder moon is new again the Tribes
will resolve to go far to the West.
But I love the life the Pale Face leads
too well, and so dost thou in thy

can the Fleet Deer mate with the

"My father is stronger than he
seems," she saijAwith a flash from her
great brown eyes that made the trait-

heard then how her Black ,Moose in
his roaming has been caught in the
toils of-the daughter of the Pale Face,"
bitterly laughed Joliper, filling out the
narrative with incidents so plausible
Maya's faith was for a moment shaken
for he hinted more than he told. But
she checked the doubt as unholy. The
lovers had made an early .compact if
ever the clouds of distrust came be-d
tween them to see each other face to
face, before taking a step toward part-
ing, and let their frank glances chase
away the shadows.     Thoughtlessly
made, it was sacredly remembered;
and with defiant look she flung back
the falsehood.
Then Joliper, in his rage, fast and
furiously poured forth the proofs of his
hate and his villainy : Recreant or
true, thou shalt never wed him. The
Chiefs shall never trust him, and I

149
shall never fear him more ! When he
returns it will be in disgrace, for 1
have shown them the secret springs of
his pretended patriotism. They know
thy tastes for the fashions of' heir foes.
They suppose thou must stay for thy
father's sake, and I have told them it
is thy voice, not his, they hear even
counselling to cling to the ancient
hunting grounds.   What if all be
lalse, they believe it is more thy smile
than their good he cares for, and I
shall see to it his smooth tongue wags
not much longer to thwart my wishes.
Scorn on, proud girl ! the time draws
near when thou shalt beg love of him
thou scornest," and stifling a curse, he
leaped on his horse and disappeared in
the forest.
All this time with an arrow ready to
avenge a to  h of insult, among the
stunted tr es stood Omoyao. He had

left the hunt when he noticed that
strange and abrupt departure, which
boded no good to the angel of his wor
ship. Crossing the river above, and
climbing the bluff he saw all, and
heard enough to forwain him of covert
dangers, and without making his pres-
once known stole away as noiselessly as
he had come till the few miles were
passed that brought him to his Island
home,
With body wearied and mind over-
wrought he sank upon his bear-skin
couch but not to sleep- He could no
more stop the throbs of his brain than
the beats of his heart- The ceaseless
flow of thought went on pitilessly, till
every nerve was in thrill and will had
control no longer. Beside time was'
too precious thus to squander  The
night was to plan in, the morrow to

of his enemies. He quailed not for the
ambush or the assassin. His prowess
could shield himself as of old, but ob-
jects were in jeopardy he loved better.
Should the poison work long enough,
and his influence be broken, the na-
tional ties would dissolve like frost
work, and then life would not be worth
the living ; or worsted,with the ban of
the Tribes upon hip, how could he
save Maya from an embrace worse
than the grave.
When daylight streaked the sky he
was still thinking, but the flutter of
the faculties was gone,and a new sensor
seemed added so supernaturally clear

but thanked the Great Spirit for send-

He saw the danger each mast meet or shun,
And quickly planned what must be quickly done'
A fortnight would elapse before the
council, that could only be fraught with
opportunities to Joliper and disaster to
him. That fortnight must be blotted
out ! Calling the fleetest runners ,of
the tribe, he spoke : "Heaston to the
Chiefs and the warriors at the chase,
and say the Warden of Mahopac -sum-
mons them    to the Ancient Council
Chamber on the night of the full moon
instead of the new. Speak not with

This power of changing the times

was one of the few prerogatives that
still clung to an office somewhat like
and sacred as that of Roman Augur.
The Chiefs of the Mahopacs had held
it for centuries. The mysterious lake
was under their-peculiar guardianship,
and through the ages they alone could
build the yearly council. fire that was
wont to light the Island. Many who
have rowed around it will recognize the
name of Petrea, which some sailor has
painted on the rocks close by where
now the skiffs land their daily freight
of pienicers ; and to some it will bring
back happy memories of rustic joys,
and gleams of the days of young ro-
mance. Such will remember the dell,
so level, so spacious, with one side
open to the Lake, and the rest closed
in by craggy ledges higher than the
pines. Here was the old Mohegan

its walls of granite, and. its floor of
mossy greensward and its arched roof
of azure. Omoyao was its Warden,
The runners returned at the time
appointed with their mission accom-
plished. They met not on their way
with Joliper, who was at the English
settlement awaiting Omoyao's return,
plotting on, all unsuspicious of the
presence of the master-hand that way
brushing away like cobwebs the wiles
he had wovet. At noon the next day
the Warden kindled the fire and left it
smouldering. Then crossing to the
mainland, he rode away to the Falls of
the Crotonto consult with Maya before
the Chiefs should. gather at the twi-n
light.
For secrecy he fastened his horse
below, where two trees had met in
falling and bridged. the stream, taking

an unfrequented .path through the
woods that led to her abode. In front
the tent sat the old man asleep and
within were sung the songs he loved to
hear. At his entrance doubt and sad-
ness, surprise and joy chased each
other the maiden's face, as shadows fly
across the mountain before the sun-
light through the rifted clouds.
Her first words were full of trust;
" Maya has wanted thee so much ;
when wilt thou take her to thyself ?"
"Sooner   than  the   Fleet Deer
dreams of " he answered with a trium-
phant smile, "to-night !" Then she told
him what was unheard in the witness-
ed interview, and he surprised her
with the knowledge of the Chiefs'
gathering at evening, where their be-
trothal should be celebrated, and Joli-
per's calumnies refuted forever.
Meanwhile the latter had been rous-

ed to desparation by news of the War-
den's summons. The plots were not
matured, that would have prevented
that hated presence at the council; yet
he might wring his heart through
Maya, whom with some of his ready
English minions he could carry off and
marry at his leisure. With this intent
they, were even now hovering about
her dwelling when the creeping spy
heard within the voice of Omoyao.
Here was a double opportunity thrust
upon him, and worth an ambush.
No sooner had the Chief lifted the
tent-cloth than an arrow whizzed past
and the old man rolled down dead at
-his feet. Carrying him in gently he
spoke to the awestruck girl: " He is
beyond the reach of insult, but not
thou! Speed through the forest and
meet me at the Island." As she fled
one way he rushed out the other upon

the mongrel gang, and cutting his way
through them with his hatchet, leaped
down the bluff. Maya's canoe lay
there, and he spun it out into the rap-
ids ,where Joliper did not dare to fol-
low, but with arrows down through
the foam it sped like a feather, poised
so true, and steered so steadily, and in
a little while, unharmed, his good steed
was bearing him swiftly homeward.
Then he heard his pursuers shouting
to each other. They had swam their
horses across above, and swept round
to cut him off, but the Pass was
near, and if he could reach it first
there was a chance of foiling their fell
design. The trees flew past,and as he
dashedthrough it he could almost feel
their breath upon his cheek.
On, on, Mahopac is in sight. Over
the streams without ever touching the
water Selim flies like the wind. He

knows whom he carries. Once more
noble Selim! and thy work is done.-
Too far! too steep ! the chief's horse
is down, and his foes are upon him.
Then he stood at bay. His hatchet
he flung crashing into the skull of
one ; a swoop of his arm laid another
low; and all the while his greedy eyes
roamed round for Joliper. But he
cared not to face his prisoner even
bound and helpless, for they could not
bind the glance of scorn, and that he
shrank before. So, through the dus-
ky light, they bore him to the edge. of
the wooded Cape that puts out into the.
Lake, South of Petrea. There tied to
a tree, Toliper taunted him, and set-
ting the woods on fire behind and
araund, left him to his fate; hasting
himself to the assembled warriors, and
answering their wondering eyes with
a tale of their warden's desertion.

Omoyao could see the gleaming of
the council-fire,' and thought was
agony. Like a lion in toils he strained
at his bonds, but there was no hope
till the fast encircling flames should
loose them, and free body and spirit
together. Higher leapt the lurid light
till 'the lake was lit with the glare of
the burning forest. Th   oar of the
crackling flames, the shrie1ing of the
birds, the flashing of the waves and
canopy of rolling smoke made up a
scene grand and terrible. The war
den looked on unmoved, and made
ready to chant his death song, but the
sound of a paddle and Maya's ringing
tones changed it to one of triumph.-
Merciful winds blew the flame back-
ward, till she had sprung up the bank,
and snapped the e rds asunder. At
last they had met nevermore to be

I have seen you in the battle, ye were lions of the
fight.
I have heard you in the Council, wheu the watch-
are lit the glen

And the clouds of war hung o'er us, ye were all un-
daunted then.
Snake or traitor hissed that whisper ; sell your for-
est ; there is rest,
On the shores of Mississippi, on the prairies of the
west.
Who the crafty counsel uttered? Let him in the
firelight stand !
Ha! he dare not, Crouching Coward ! palsied be
thy trembling hand,
When the Pale Face rushes on thee ! Warriors
spurn a lying tongue."

At Jo-liper's cowering head, a hundred tomahawks
were flung.

"Stand Mohegans! By the memory of the ages
that are gone !
By each mound and path of battle, on the foaming
Kichawan !
By the Lake the Spirit gave us ! Breast to breast,
and eye to eye,
Let us swear the oath of glory-one to couquer,one
to die.
Sound your wad-cry once forever, from Grand Sa-
chem's hoary steep,
Where the Eagles have their Eyries, and our Coun-
try's vi gii- keep;
Twice ten thousand shouts shall answer, from the
river to the sea
Dare, nor falter ! Fear is failure-Uraven hearted ;
will ye flee?
Go ! the western tribes shall meet yon; ye will be
GO ! and perish in your eakness ; perish from the
minds of men,
Like the Highland river yonder, in its mountains
wild and free.
In the Ocean lost forever So shall be your desti-
ny."

Then he turned hi o the maiden-worthy she to
be his Queen,
With her.lustrous ye unquailing, and her calm,
majestic mien ;
She, the Angel of his Worship, she, the Hearer o f
his Prayer,
Maiden of the beaming forehead, and the flowing
raven hair.
Wrapping close his, mantle round him, pointing
down the the dark abyss,
" Maya," cried heI; "I huve wooed thee, yet I
wooed thee not for this.  Â°
Here hath been my fathers' chiefdom, by Mahopacs
craggy side,
Here shall be my grave, 0 Maya t will thou be my
Spirit bride ?"
Looking on them long they listened, but she mur -
imured naught, nor spoke,
Only clung to Omoyao as the woodbine clasps the
oak.
And the chieftains, haft persuaded, paused a mo
ment in their flight.
Turned and saw the-dauntless lovers, leap together
from the height,
Beauty clinging unto grandeur, high resolve and
love allied;
Waves of life that met to perish, sothey might flow
side by side.
I have seen the brow of woman, with. a nobler ra-
diance diaht
Than theewelled crown bestoweth, or 'the dia-
mond's magic light,
I have dreamed peerless women-Queens of all
the mythic time,
In the realms of glory standing, isolated and sub-
lime;
Like lone columns rising over, lalen domes and
ruined shrines,
V1 i. the mellow twilight robes them, and the ivy
round them twines.

But to me that Indian maiden, faithful to the death
and true
Though her bridal robe were sackcloth, land her gar-
land were the yew,
Ever in the summer moonlight, or among the
throngs of men,
Comes so marked gin'life immortal, that me thinks
I saw her then !
And like waving woof of amber, all around the ma-
ples old
When the frost has touched the forest, and the
leaves are green and gold,
Maya's trust and woman's loving, lightens Petrea's
rocky shore,
Robes in romance, Lake and Island ; links them to
her evermore.
