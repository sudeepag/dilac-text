                 THE CONFESSIONS OF A MINISTER. Being leaves from the Diary of the REV. JOSEPHUS LEONHARDT, D D.  "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone." PHILADELPHIA: H. PETERSON & CO., No. 920 Walnut Street. 1874. }    ,   Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1874, by H. PETERSON. & CO., in the Office of the Librarian of Congress Washington.   PREFACE BY THE EDITOR. NOT with any design of ministering to a morbid or corrupt taste, are the following pages from the Diary of Dr. Leonhardt-lion-like in nature, as we thySk him, as well as in name-laid before the public. That they ghear upon the great Drama now being transacted before us, and which is one of the most affecting ones that ever convulsed a community, it is not our intention to deny. But the object is to purify and exalt, not to debase the minds of our readers. One great reason of the interest taken in the un- happy case--unhappy in any point of view-to which we have alluded, is the feeling that the institution of Marriage, as it exists among us, is being questioned more or less directly by many influential, and even sincere and thoughtful minds. To the right settle- ment of this question, we trust, the present volume will be found of some value. The conclusions to which Dr. Leonhardt arrived, are those, we think, which will survive the heat of the warmest and frankest discus- sion, being founded upon the Rock of the Eternal Truth of God. PHILADELPHIA, August, x874.   DIARY. BERLIN, MONDAY, the 18th, x8-. These are the first lines I have penned in my Diary for three months. Why? Am I afraid to commune with myself; to talk to myself with a sincerity greater than that between the closest friends? I hope not. I hope I am not grown cowardly, though both love and shame are said to make men cowards. But I have no cause for shame. I have arrived at the very summit of prosperity, the very height of my fame, the very pinnacle of the temple. Without political office, I am a political power. Even the King has asked me of late to his counsels. And surely no man exercises a greater influence over the opinions of his countrymen than I do. I am one of the leaders of the liberal thought of my time, steadily urging on the world to larger and larger spheres of   NFESSIONS OF A MNISTER.  freedom, And as I look forward over the thousand years to come, I see chains breaking in all directions, until there shall be no thrones, and every man shall have. a voice in the government, and even every woman, to use the language of that eloquent Irish- man, Curran, "be redeemed, regenerated and disen- thralled by the genius of universal emancipation." I see clearly the goal to which we are all tending, and t, which Europe and the civilized world, if they would be "not Cossack," must inevitably come. The complete liberty of the individual man. The State, embodying the power of aristocratic rulers, or of majorities of the lmasses, heretofore has ruled the individual man absolutely, and even yet rules him too absolutely. For long centuries it assumed the power to determinefor him what he should believe, and how he should-worship his God. Now that claim is given up. But others equally tyrannical are main- tained. What right has the State to determine how I shall live, more than how I shall believe and worship? So long as I do not interfere with the rights or privilees or property of another, what business is it of the Courts and the Constable?  Grant that the individual is living an improper life,   DIARY.          7 why is he to be forcibly interfered with in that, any more than in holding and proclaiming false and mis- chievous religious views? Religion is the core of every man's opinions and conduct. Once admit that you may not interfere with a man's religion, or his false religion, or his want of religion, and you have given up the right to interfere with him at all. He may do infinite mischief indirectly by his false reli- gious views, as by his bad modes of living; but that gives the State no right to interfere with either. Only when he injures or attempts to injure his neigh- bor directy, can the Judge and the Constable properly be invoked, Am I wrong in not uttering these gtraruths. pub- licly and in their fulness? Did not the Saviour, the Divine and unutterable One say, "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you?" Ah, my dear congregation, you are not swine-far frorh it. I might almost with safety, lay my most precious pearls of thought before you. But from my little pulpit, I speak th and am heard by the great multitudes of the land. Not entirely wrong was he who said of me, that never since Paul had there been    8     CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. a preacher who affected more widely and strongly the ' hearts of men. And I rejoice that it is so, and that i cautiously, but continually I am breaking down the old partition walls of clan and sect, now bristling along the top with broken glass and sharpened spikes, so that men can lean over them anc clasp warm hands of human brotherhood and love. And I re- joice that, as'occasion serves, I put the keen point of my sword into the vital part of some old superstition which still desecrates the earth, so deftly that itt dies without seeming even to show its wound, and so in- nocently that even its besotted worshippers do not seem quite sure; as they look up with their bleared  eyes in amazement at seeing their old idol reel and fall, that I dealt: the deadly thrust. And"I rejoice that through methe reign of these old superstitions is passing away, and that a new. heaven and a new  : earth, the holy Jerusalem foretold in the visions of John the Divine, is fast"coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for fhr hus- band, and withrthe Lord God and the Lamb as the   1 light thereof. ' ",   -      i    DIARY. MONDAY, 25th. A busy week. But Monday is the Minister's Sun day and holiday, if not holy day, and I sit down again to write. Ah, my Diary, thou art the best of friends. I need use no deceit, nor even the shadow of deceit, with thee. Others may not understand me, may see me as through a glass darkly, and of various colors,.but thou knowest in reality what I am. Ahd what am I?   A man who believes, in all truth and sincerity, that he has a work to do in the world. A mission-yes, as those silly female reformers who gabble so much now-a-days, would say,:a mission-to enlarge the boundaries of Zion; to spread the sweet influences of peace and good fellowship; to pierce with an Ithuriel spear the toads of superstition which still squat at the sleeping ears of our old women-- male and female-and in all things thus to smooth the pathway for the speedy coming of our Lord and his Christ. I have been looking over last Monday's Diary. That was a curious coincidence. Just as my pen had. finished the line "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband," a knock at the door of my study in- terrupted me. A  visitor had called. .It was young Karl. He had come to engage my services. for his   10    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. marriage to the beautiful Margaret, to whom he has  I been so long affianced, that I began to believe, al- i most to hope, the wedding never would come off./ He is a fine fellow-but she I Well, every one, even the most fortunate, I suppose,  has the bitter drop in his cup. I have fame, a large salary, the favor of all men; I might almost say that my lines have gone out through all the earth, and my  words to the end of the world. But I have not Mar- garet.                        I Of course I promised to perform my part in the ceremony,-said it would give me great joy to do  so-may Gbd forgive me for the well-meant falsehood. I ought to feel thus. He has won' her fairly,-let - him take and war her,-Margaret, my pearl!  Why should she have been born twenty years later than Hor I twenty years too soon. Or why should I, misled by a common delusion or illusion, have married-and not waited? If I weie unmarried I would defy Karl to win her. In spite of his years. For that matter I think we are better suited for each other now, than if'our ages were nearer. Yes, the :birth-angel was right. It was I. who was wrong-my youthful; haste, youthful heat blinded my eyes. And yet I thought I loved my Gertrude when I   DIARY.         I I married her. I did love her. But that was twenty years ago-perhaps the very day and hour that Mar- garet was born. If any one had told me then to pause, for that my true love was an infant, a baby lying for the first time that moment on its mother's breast, I should have laughed and gone on. Yes, doubtless, even if an angel had told me s4should have laughed scornfully, and gone on carelessly with the marriage rites. For I thought I loved Gertrude as well as I could ever love woman. I did love her. This marriage question is a mighty and an intri- cate one, and I confess I am a good deal at sea about it. Marriage without love is wrong, sinful, no mar- riage at all-every noble and pure spirit admits that. But how then if the love fade away-must the mar- ried life still continue? And can it be right to yield the body in embraces no longer sanctified by the warmest affection of the soul? But, say the orthodox and the Philistines, having once promised to love until the end, you must keep that promise and love on. Is love then a mere mat- ter of the will? If it is, why demand that marriage in tne first place shall be sanctified by any deeper, purer feeling than therwill can originate?. Why in-   12    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTkk. sist upon the necessity of love at all, if love can be  felt at pleasure?  A man and a woman marry. The man may enter. upon a course of life, such as I entered upon, calcu- lated to expand and strengthen his intellect, and de- velop all his higher powers. Tle woman may sit down to her needle, or give herself up to her domes- tic affairs, varied by the-reading of shallowhooks,  and more or less empty gossip. In twenty years, what comes of it? The man has enlarged tihe sphere of his thoughts, feelings-and activities-the woman has contracted hers. Sir Walter Scott takes a walk with his wife, and tell her how muchhe likes the lambs in the field; she says that she likes them too, fricasseed. The varied spheres no longer harmonize. Thus a range oJ years always brings great changes. The parties may harmonize perfectly at the first--but 'one may develop greatly,.as we have said, the other not at all--or both may develop greatly, in different directionis. The voice of the bride may be like :the notes of a flute--the voice of the wife, after twenty years, may be that of a termagant. Can you wonder, under such circumstances, that when everything else suffers such a change, the heart also should change. Take even the one matter of personal beauty.   DIARY.         13 How much of the- young man's love of his bride, in three cases out of four, is based upon the beauty of her radiant youth. He extols her shapely foot and hand-he goes mad over her eyes and lips, and the graceful curves of her form. When these charms van- ish, is it to be wondered at that love often vanishes with them? As his wife is to-3ahe never would have thought of marrying her: ' Of course know the other side. I know how a man's chivalry may fairly be appealed to. The woman has lost her beauty in your service, and in that of your children-will you fling away the rose, after you have rumpled and stained it yourself? I answer, of course, no--though both men and women do that with roses. But I admit there is something unmanly in treating a woman, and especially a woman whom we have loved, like a toy or a-flower, which we value no longer when its gilding has worn off, or its beauty and fragrance have passed away. Gertrude has been in her mode, a faithful and lovirg wife to me, and a fond and careful mother to her children-and though her temper is not always as sweet as I would like it, and -her voice has a shrill tone occasionally which I never could have belieed possible in her youthful days-although her mother's    NFESSIONS OF A MNISErK. had it, as I remember--and, talking here in confi. dence to my Diary, while I honor and esteem, I do not love her-still for what she has been to me I shall always hold her in due reverence, and as something sacred. It seems to me that where I have once loved, I can never entirely unlearn the old feeling. : The love: of women, when they are neglected or deserted, may turn into hatred, but no circumstances, of any kind, could induce me to injure a woman I had once loved. X That fact alone would make her forever after a sacred object to me. MONDAY, the j3it. It is over. Heven 1-have pronounced them man and wife. What an ordeal for the poor human heart. But language, they say, is given us to conceal our thoughts-and smiles and laughter also serve well the samte necessry purpose. Do I deceive myself in thinkigithat after the marriage ceremony was over, she seemed to like my compariy better than that of the bridegroom-and tthat wheneer I glaced that way, I cauight her eyes upon me? ' That girl first attracted my attention by the rapt mianner'withi which she hung upon evry word of my   DIARY.   sermons. A fervent and deeply religious soul, it seemed as if some seraph had strayed down from heaven, and was listening to me. At first, I oc- casionally felt embarrassed. It seemed folly to dis- course with such a listener. It seemed as if s not only must fully comprehend all that I said, but in- finite depths of knowledge and faith and truth beyond. But as I came to know and talk with her, I found that she was all modesty, all humility-looking up to me as to her spiritual guide and teacher. Oh, such natures will insist upon worshipping. If they cannot find the divine to worship, they will worship the hu- man, thinking it all divine.* I have warned her against leaning implicitly upon me, or upon any other mere earthly guide.. MONDAY. What a singular girl! Yesterday, after the service, she began a conversation by alluding to the warning I had recently given her. "My dear pastor," said she, "how do you explain this?" and she pointed with her finger-white andeslenderas the finger of an anget-to this passage in Corinthians--"But I would have you know that the head of every an is Christ;.-    IO    CON ifSFSIONS OF A MNISThI;K. and the head of the woman is the tman; and the head of Christ is God.". "If this--be so," said she, "is it not right for the woman to look up to and worship the man, as the man looks up to and worships Christ?"' 'And as' she said this, she .bent a look of reverent admiration, almost of -worship, upon me. What could I say?, Could I say better than I did? That the Apostle, according to the words of Peter,ut. tered many things which werei deep: and difficult to understand, and that we were in danger, of wresting these hard sayings tour own -destruction. Clear- headed, quick-thoughted, she saw at once that I had evaded the -question-,that I had :not answered her, could-not answer her.\- And as :amy -ad -eted upon the book, she bent down her rose-bud lips and touched it. -Then she blushed to her temples and the tips of her fingers, and hastened away. / What can one do with such a girl-by nature a devotee and a saint? - Utferily'ietl ^d 'pure herself, ? she does-not have the shadow of a;thought how she^might arouse the sleeping passionisof some men's souls. For me-why shouldlI deny that as her lips touched my hand, a-divine thrill shot through me. I am glad that it is I for whom she has conceived this devotioni and not any other man or, minister in Ber-   DIARY.         x 7 lin. I love her so well and truly that I can guard her even from herself.  Love does note injure the beloved object to gratify itself. Our great poet, Goethe, in hismagnificent drama, has committed what I'would almost call a blunder, were it not irreverence towards so great a genius. He pictures Faust as loviig--ioving truly-- the innocent, beautiful Margaret. If he-does not picture, and mean to picture, true love in his hero, I am greatly in error. And yet would true love deceive and betray? I might also say abandon- - only it may be urged with some, though' not suf- ficient force, that Faust was compelled to fly, to save himself from being arrested as the murderer of her brother. But he could have taken Margaret with him, or sent for her afterwards-not seemed to forget her entirely.' But, to come back to the other point, would Paust, if he- had really lovied Margaret, have betrayed her-?"He knew what the result would be to herl fair fame and frer future peace, if she yieldedto him with- out marriage. He was not a foolish bo-he was a wise man. Either then Faust did not trulylove Mar- garet,; and' deeser oiur chnftempt and aat:ed-ri the poet: has pictured himi fAls"el ' y. .  2: 2    18    CONFESSIONS OF A MNIST!;iK. I have another point of quarrel with the poet. Faust's compact with Mephistopheles was that if the latter ever succeeded in making him so happy and contented that he should say to the passing moment, "Ah, still delay--thou art so fair!" then he would be his servant and his victim. But if Faust truly loved so charming a creature as Margaret, did not that moment come when in her encircling arms? Oh that divine thrill when my Margaret only bent down her ripe lips and lightly touched my fingers! If such a thrill could last forever, heaven could be no more exquisite joy. Hhave loved Gertrude, but she must be common clay-for nothing so divinely exquisite and transporting ever thrilled 'any being from any touch of hers. MONDAY. Oh, these relations of the sexes-this feeling and passion oDif -Love. They give-me more trouble than all my other pastoral difficulties. One of my con- gregation, a pretty young girl, has come to shame. She hasbeen living in the house of one of my strong friends, Rudolph -von Arnheim,. And he is a mar- ried man too. She denied the whole- thing until it   DIARY.          9 could be denied no longer. I have talked with Rudolph. He owned to me that the girl's statement was true--and says he will provide for her and the child. But he would not admit any moral guilt. This was, in brief, his defence: "I cannot help it. God made me full to overflowing of strength, of vitality. I am a human steam-engine. If I were in the East, I would have three or four wives, as the patriarchs had of old. And I am able to take care, and would take care, of them and their children. But society will not allow that-society says. I must confine myself to one wife, and she is sick half the time-and society must take the consequences." I argued the matter with him. I showed him that whatever might have been true of the patriarchs, that in the beginning it was not so--one woman, Eve, being created for one man, Adam. And that the numbers of the two sexes had been about the same ever since- so that if every man had his wife, there could not be more than one for any. That all pas- sionswere right in their harmonious proportion and that excess was simply a sign of disease. It was a monstrosity, for which nature, and therefore a lop- erly organized society, did not and would not pro- vide. That polygamy was destructive of the highest   20     CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. welfare of any people that embraced it--the proof, being that the nations Wvhich allowed it had sunk far below the'standard of the nations which held to the i teachings of Christ, and did not tolerate it. Rudolph is very stubborn when he takes a notion, and would not be convinced. Of course H am able to look at the matter as a philosopher as well as a moralist and a minister. I see how nature is not really at -fault-managing matters, as she does, on general principles. It is necessary that the world should be peopled, that society should go on, that we all should not, in despair, turn Shakers, and the world of man come to an end. This is necessary. There- fore nature makes the passion of LJove strong and overpowering. Think of it.  Think how a man voluntarily assumes the support of a woman and his and her children-how he labors year iniand year out, from motrting till night, not mainly for himself, but for the-tn. For his wife's support, for his children's suppor and education and future success in life. Why should a man do this-shouldering such a life- long burden -of toil, care, anxiety, aiid often want? To cause him to do it, wise Nature, which is but an- other word for God, made Love--both as anaffection sadfiast a as psSion-the very strongest feeling of our   DIARY.          2 I being. A great end was to be attained-and Nature ordained the means to be sufficiently powerful. Men might complain, men might transgress, but she would not be balked. Looking thus at the matter as a philosopher, and not as a minister, these aberrations from the true sphere of harmony and virtue, excite in me no more surprise than the bursting of a steam-boiler, or the jumping of a locomotive from the iron track. The tremendous character of the power, in the present chaotic condition of the world, could not be lessened without causing more harm than good-and where- ever there is so tremendous a power, we must expect occasional accidents and explosions. As for my friend Rudolph, perhaps it would have been better had he been born in the East, and had his dozen wives, if he wanted them. And he is rich, and there is no law forbidding him to go there. But our so- ciety is wisely arranged, upon a different and higher principle; and while he stays here, he must abide by our morality and our laws. From Rudolph, with his immense but coarse physi- cal energies, I do not expect the highest kind of love, or else I should have said to him :--You profess to love that girl, and yet you are degrading her and  **     , -   22    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. dragging her to the dust-so that she becomes the jeer and sport, and dirty plaything, it may be, of the world! How can you think of the hand you have fondled, the cheek you have kissed, the bosom you  have pressed to yours, coming to that? A man loves  at least his own body-and she has become, in one sense, a part of yours. And iftyou allow her to be- come defiled, you are defled yourself. Oh, if you be a man indeed, and full of the instincts and noble nature of a man, do not defile that which even in the  least degree you have made one with yourself by love.  But this kind of appeal would all be wasted upon : Rudolph, and upon mei like him. For they are  always of the earth, earthy; and often of the filth, ! and sensual and devilish.          J   i SUNDAY NIGHT. It is a pity that so many ladies, and married ladies at that,: will forget that a minister is not always an  i abstraction or a dried mummy, but made of flesh and blood like other men. They seem to think that a minister is only another kind of woman. In charity I make this supposition. Why else will they crowd   DIARY.    X     23 around me as they do, extol my sermons as angelic utterances, and press my hand so often and with such affectionate warmth? If it were at that so many of them are not particularly admirable in their personal appearance and personal habits, and that they thus shock or disgust where they desire to please, an average minister would have to be a Joseph or a St. James to keep his 4nind and heart perfectly pure and blameless. I hold with Paul that every minister should be " the husband of one wife," and I would add to Paul, that this wife of the minister's should make it her special business to stand between her husband and all these pestering hussies, especially the soft-eyed ones that mean mischief. MONDAY. Margaret has had her first disagreement with Karl. Of course she came to me, her spiritual father and head, as she termed me, to ask advice about it. I advised her as wisely as I could. Curious, it is not coldness she complains of, but too much warmth. Karl, young husband like, is too loving-wants to fondle and caress her all the time. She grows tired of it--sometimes almost becomes disgusted with it-   24 -   CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. t and repulses him in some way, as delicately as she can. Then he grows angry, and upbraids her with no- longer loving him. "Talks like a proud and passionate boy," she says, "more than a man." Karl had even told her in his anger the evening be- fore, that she was, he feared, too much of a saint for him; he liked women better than saints. Foolish Karl! not even a Margaret contents him! He has an angel, and he wishes to strip off her wings, that she may be like any other giub of the earth. I could not help blaming Karl a little, as a man who did not know the-value of the treasure he pos- sessed, and at this she colored, and looked pleased. But, as I said, I counselled her wisely; I would scorn to do otherwise. I told her that Karl was her husband, and as such had a right to fondle and caress her, and that if she did not feel in the mood at the time, she should disguise her feelings, and try to divert his attention to something else. All men re- quired to be managed, and few of them objected to it, even if they knew they were being managed, if it were delicately and skilfully done. A cold repulse in such cases would arouse a man's resentment quicker than almost any thing else. That men, and women too, were particularly susceptible on this point.   DIARY.          25 She promised to be as compliant as she'could, but said, with a little touch of impatience, that there was something she thought peculiarly unpleasant in being caressed continually, and that her manner was natur- ally so sincere and frank, that it almost felt to her like telling a falsehood when she simulated a fond- ness she did notWeel. And Karl was such a boy. She thought that an older man w6uld have more thoughtfulness and discretion. I answered that Karl was correcting' that fault of being too young every day, and growing. older as rapidly as he could; to which she laughed a pretty little laugh, and said she supposed so. Rising to depart, she held out her hand. I took it in mine. Heaven forgive me if I held it longer than was need- ful. But she did not seem in haste to withdraw it, and it was beyond my power, as it seemed, coldly to let it go. It was an entirely innocent thing on both sides, and it is almost foolish for me to have had a single after-thought about it. Hand-shaking is not a sin, even when it is a beautiful woman's hand. But still it becomes all men, and especially a minister, to be careful. I Affection flows naturally and gently through words; but passion flashes through a touch. "Say what you please, but hands off," used to be my wise mother's maxim.   26    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. MONDAY. I am afraid that Karl does not quite like the en- thusiastic way in which his wife sometimes speaks of me. Gertrude was there the other day, and she told me with laughter, when she came home, that Marga- ret'thought me little less than St. Peter and St. Paul put together, saying that it was universally admitted that I was the most eloquent preacher in Germany, if not in the whole world, and that she could kneel down and worship me just as easily as men did the Apostles. I will say this for my Gertrude, she is not a jealous woman. Smallness is not one of her faults. To my question what she answered to such an eulogium, she came up and kissed me on the forehead, and said with some warmth, and in a serious tone, "I told her I thought so too." "And what did Karl say?"I continued. "He did not like it over-much that Margaret should talk so enthusiastically of any other man, minister,though he be, and said that Dr. Leon- hardt was certainly an able man; but all women thought their own physician and minister the best in the world." I am sorry that thus another element of discord between Margaret and her young husband should be at work, and tenfold sorry that I should be the cause. I know Margaret will impute it to a small   DIARY.         27 and unworthy jealousy on the part of Karl; that jealousy which narrow-minded men feel so often towards their intellectual superiors. MONDAY, I2 P. M. I think I have done a good evening's work. Ger- trude and I took. tea at Karl's. In the beginning of the evening I perceived a slight coolness on Marga- ret's part towards her husband, and I exerted all my powers to overcome it. Karl has travelled, and can talk well, even eloquently, when properly drawn out, and I did my best to show him off to advantage, talking myself no more than was absolutely needful. At the close of the evening I delicately complimented the young man for the pleasure and instruction he had afforded us, and advised him to prepare a lecture upon his travels, and I would preside at its delivery, and use all my influence to obtain him a good audi- ence and the necessary notices in the journals. Mar- garet looked upon him with pride, and Karl thanked me warmly. I think I have done my duty, and at some little cost to my own selfish feelings, this night.   28     CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. THURSDAY. The fat is all in the fire again. Margaret has been to see me on another visit for pastoral advice. Karl has some acquaintances, both male and female, whose excessively liberal and rather irreligious habits of thought and speech Margaret does not admire. He has been inviting them to the house. Their conver- sation shocked and pained Margaret inexpressibly. She Demonstrated with Karl, but he simply said they were old friends of his, and his friends ought to be hers, and had at least a right to respectful treatment. As-to their opinions, they were -partly his own, at least he was not certain that they were far wrong. They were not, he admitted, either Pharisees or hy- pocrites'; but that, in such a day as this, was a great deal in their favor. Thus the conversation went on, and, as is usual, from warmth to warmth, and from extreme assertion on the one side to equally extreme assertion on the other. I saw that this was even a more serious matter than the other disagreement. On a point where con- science and religion were involved, this gentle Mar- garet could be solid and firm as a rock. I counselled moderation and forbearance. (t was always a source of difficulty and danger in wedlock when husband   DIARY.         29 and wife were not in unison in their religious views, and especially where each had strong convictions But they were married, and should accommodate themselves to each other as best they could. He had a right to his opinions, as she had to hers. Though neither had the right to outrage the faith of the other. But under such circumstances as she had portrayed, if her husband would persist in bringing that kind of people into the house, she could do nothing better than submit. It was her cross, and she must patiently bear it. "I perceive," reptied Margaret, "that I married too hastily and inconsiderately. And yet Karl never allowed me to see this side of his character during our acquaintance, or our betrothal and marriage would never have taken place. He deceived me." "Not necessarily," I replied. "Circumstances did not occur to bring this part of his character for- ward. Even if they had, he probably would have instinctively shrunk from uttering any opinion that would lessen him in your eyes. It is the innocent deceit of love to act in this way. We cannot expect that a young man or young maiden should do other- wise. ( And yet this continual assuming of a pleasant mask, so that neither sees the true character of the   3    CONFESSIONS OF A MN ISTER. other until it is too late for withdrawal, is one of the most obvious reasons why we have so many unhappy marriages."  "You are so wise," said she, after a pause. "I wish that fate had so ordered it, that my husband were a man to whom I could look up implicitly as to my intellectual and spiritual lord and master. Upon whose judgment I could assuredly rely, as upon the oracles of God. Then I should have been happy; oh so happy!" and she burst into tears. It unmans me to see a woman in tears. I took her hand in mine, and drew her to my side. "You for- get," said I, "all that you have, in thinking of what you have not.  Karl is young"-here she -gave a gesture of impatience--" handsome, well-off in this world's goods, cultivated and free from serious vices. You do not sympathize entirely in your religious views, and have some other points of dissimilarity; but whoever you had chosen, he would not be per- fect, for perfect men are not found in this world." "I think I know one perfect man," replied she in a soft tone. "Then he is the man you should have married," I uttered, a little hastily. "Suppose he was married already?" ^               *i   DIARY.         31 "Then you should never think of him in that con- nection."                 L "I never do, but I cannot help wishing that Karl was more like him," and she seized my hand and covered it with kisses. As I am a Christian man, I say it in all honesty, I did not dream she was alluding to me until then. And it came upon me like a blow, almost taking away my breath. A sweet, intoxicating blow, I ac- ,knowledge, for before God made me a minister, he made me a man, with all the forces and failings of a I man. But I recovered myself in an instant. I remem- bered my character and my sacred office. "Marga- ret," said I sternly, placing her in a chair, "you have said that which you should not have -said. Never talk to me or of me in that way again, lest you lose my respect forever." She looked up startled and terrified, gave me one glance of mingled love-adoration I might almost 4rm it-and upbraiding, and then with a wailing sob, flung herself at my feet, and clasped my knees, f weeping as if her very heart would break. I smoothed her soft brown hair with my hand, and tried to com- pose her.  L   32    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. "Forgive me,' at length she said. "Falsehood comes so hard, and truth so easy to me." I want you to be truthful, but even the truth should not be spoken at all times; and in this matter you deceive yourself." I endeavored to raise her to her chair. III will not rise, godlike man," she said; -tuntil I have your forgiveness, not only the forgiveness of your lips, but of your heart." "I freely forgive you, Margaret." "And will hold me as dear a friend as ever?" "A dearer friend than ever." And our interview ended. It was a perilous situation for a man to be placed in; but I think I acted rightly, and as one worthy of the high calling with which I have been called. Of course I do not deny that it is pleasant to know that the loveliest woman in the land thinks more highly of me than of any one else, and regrets as I do that fate has been so unkind. I think I should have to be more or less than a man not to feel this in my secret heart, although I would not confess it to any one else for the world. Oh, rare, glorious Margaret t perhaps in some future state of existence we may come together. And is not this thought in   DIARY.         33 the highest degree probable? For it explains and justifies so much that would otherwise seem unex- plainable and not in consonance with the infinite wisdom of a God, whose highest name is love. What if this life be but the short dream of the morning, before we arise and enter upon the serious labors of the day? Oh, Margaret, it cannot be wrong for me to think that in the hereafter, our kindred, sympa- lhizing souls shall meet and flow together, like two drops of crystal-dew that thirst-to become one! MONDAY. Can it be a whole year since I last wrote in my diary? I have read over what is there written. How the memory of what has transpired since presses upon me and overwhelms me like a flood! And yet what has transpired? Nothing which I cannot in- clude in the single word, Margaret. The outward life has flowed on like a smooth and noiseless river-- the inward has been like a mountain torrent, dashing over rocks, foaming and -seething and Whirling, down, down, down, to--where?   To destruction-to per- 3   34   C CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. dition? And yet I seem to be in the grasp of some stern, Titanic fate that will not let me go. So far, thank fortune-I fear to say thank God- not both of us have been weak at the sampe time. -- How many are saved in this way, and Satan thus con- tinually foiled. Far more, I am sure, than the wise world dreams of. How often have I, under God, saved Margaret from herself. How often, tunder God; has she saved me fr{m myself. Oh, what a sweet, pure strength is that which sometimes comes to one in the very midst of the whirlpool of tempta- tion, called forth perhaps by some sacred chance word, some hallowed chance tone, some noble verse, some holy strain of music, some touching allusion to father, or mother, or sister, or God. How often have we had occasion to bless such! As the Italian lover did, when his mistress told him that her aged husband had that day praised him as the noblest of the youths of Florence. And he rose from his seat, and kissed her for the last time, and never saw her more. For how could he wrong the noble man who thought so highly of him! But we never kissed for the last time--and parted forever. How can I deny myself the soft pressure of her hand, the warm kisses of her mouth. This may   DIARY.          35 not be entirely innocent, but it is surely not so very guilty. It would kill me to give her up entirely. Karl? Why, Karl does not love her whole body as much as I love her little finger. What right has he to that for which he cares so little! They say it is dangerous floating on the edge of the abyss. It is dangerous-but it is sweet-perhaps the danger adds a peculiar and fascinating zest to the sweetness. Half the time I seem to myself like a - man in a dream. I go through the daily routine of life-its pastoral visits, its marfiage and funeral ser- vices, its exhortations and sermons, just as before, and as far as I can perceive with equal acceptability; and yet I seem to myself like a man in a hazy dream. Is this because, I am living two opposite lives-the in- ward not flowing in unison with the outward? Margaret says it is the same with her. And she, being more sensitive, and with her terrible sincerity of nature, feels it more painfully than I do. Once, in one of those moments of weakness that I have re- ferred to, she even said to me--"Would it not be better to fly together, and thus break at once with the world, than to live a continual. acted lie?" She complained that a constant round of deceit, of even the slightest character, pained and worried her more % .    36    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. than the commission of even what the world Would think a great sin, done boldly in the face of day) and followed by open actions consistent therewith. Of course such a thought as flight is madness. I could not leave my wife, my children-,leave them moreover to a heritage ofrdisgrace and shame. No, rather would I put the muzzle of a pistol to tmy fore- head than thus injure those I am pledged before man and by my vefiyature to defend and uphold. Any- thing rather than that. I may not love my Gertrude as I should love her, but she has ever been-s on her part, a loving and faithful wife---asking no more than I Was prepared to give--and a generous and self-sac. rificing mother to her children. . And how could I desert my sweet girls and noble boys? Not that, course is not possible. I cannot sacrifice everything even for love. Margaret said: "You cannot--you are a perfect man but still a man-and only a woman can sacrifice ai for love. I cannot ask you to be false to youtr very nature. For m I am not happy, though I love- you inexpressibly-and yet I cannot help loving you. You seem to be the one godlike mani that Heaven made for me.'   DIARY.         37 MONDAY, / I have just returned from a visit to Margaret. Oh, ecstasy-oh folly-oh madness! Would I had died, before this day-and yet' this day has crowned my life. How gladly would I undo all that has been done. Would I?- Does not the memory of the bliss far overpower the painful feeling of the possible sin? Ah that I should live to know that my bosom no longer could safely wear a glass, through which all men might look at will. Margaret has no children, no child. Her maid was out on an errand. Karl was at his business. Was it Satan, or some kind angel that had smoothed the pathway before us. Strange girl. She began the conversation by ask- ing me what I thought of the scripture which said that in Heaven there was no marrying nor giving in marriage. I frankly owned tha't it was too deep for my eyes to fathom-unless it meant simply what it said. "But is not Heaven perfect bliss?" she con- tinued. "Assuredly," I replied. "And must not men and women, if they remain essentially the same beings after death, and do not experience a change into other and different existences, feel the same emotions that they feel here?" "It seems so to   38     CONFESSIONS, OF A MNISTER. me," I answered. "Then how could Heaven be per- fect bliss to us, if there is no love therebetween man and woman, and no marriage as the highest express- ion of that love?" "How do you explain the words of the Saviour then, for I see you have a theory?"I responded,-for her whole countenance was lighted up with enthu- siasm. "I explain it intis way," she replied, "and I think you will agree with me. This earthly state of being, we all admit, must have its many important uses, or else we should have been born at once into Heaven; Now among these uses, is the finding and pairing of congenial souls. This seems to me, as to most women, about all that we live for. The present is the world for marriage; in the next there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage, /but simply the in- finite enjoyment of marriage by those who have been truly mated on earth." ' It is a very hard state of affairs for some of us then," I replied bitterly, "if an ill-assorted mar- riage, once made here, is to last forever." "Why harder than all the other dispensations of Providence?"' she answered. "As the twig is bent in youth by poverty or evil associations, the -tree is   i      .     DIARY.         39 inclined; and yet we also believe that as the tree falls, so shall it lie forever." "But he that knoweth not his Master's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with few stripes," I re- plied; i'while to doom a man who errs because of his youth and ignorance, to an unhappy marriage through all eternity, would be to beat him with many FTipes. Are you anxious to spend-the hereafter with Karl?"     - "I do not consider that I am really and truly mar- ried to Karl," she rejoined quickly. "Our souls are as far apart as the North Pole from the South. Is not the soul more than the body, as the body is more than raiment? I expect to pass eternity with the man to whom I am wedded in mind and soul and in- most spirit. When I rise hereafter, I shall say to Karl, 'Take the body that you wedded, if you still wish it--I leave it behind me. But my soul belongs to my beloved!'"   Then she added, in a glow of rapture, these words from the Song of songs, which is Solomon's:--"My beloved is mine, and I am his. Let him kiss me with the kcisses of his mouth, for his love is better than wine." . Marvellous woman!   Her face lightened with the splendor of her enthusiasm-her cheeks were   40     CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. flushed, her eyes shone like twin stars, her bosom heaved with emotion--she stretched forth her hands toward me. I will say no more. There are moments of de- lirium in which a man sieems not to be accountable for his actions. He obeys an overmastering im plise-be it divine or satanic, it is overmaster- ing. I had forgotten to pray that morning, before going forth on my pastoral, visits, as is my custom. Why else was I delivered up to the power of the Evil One? Or can that enthusiastic girl's explana- tion of the Scripture be true--and- is she now mine for all eternity? I am lost and distracted in a whirl- pool of doubt and uncertainty. God forgive me-- and her, if she needs forgiveness! TUESDAY. I have just received the following note from Mar- garet, by the hand of her maid, who is devoted to her:- "MY DEAREST:-I could not let the day pass without writing to you. I think of you all the time--yes, all the time. Not a minute passes that I do not recall your noble, majestic presence. Oh,   DIARY.         41 my King, my Head, my Beloved! Without you the world would be a dull and dreary blank, and life not worth the living. For all my troubles and vexations I now have one thought that cures them. He is mine forever--in the coming eternity he, will be wholly mine! What is all the bitterness of the pres- ent -inharmonious state, to the glory of such a thought as this? I feel certain now that I am yours forever. Your degoted        MARGARET. A rhapsody, the cold world would say--but what t man worthy of the name, would not feel his heart kindle as mine does to be the object of such a rhap- sody! It was penned in one of those exalted moods ; which transfigure her, and make her seem more than i woman, and as if no longer accountable to the com- } mon prosaic life and laws of the every-day world. : She belongs to that class of enthusiasts, as mankind calls there, whence come the Joans and the St. - Cecilias, the Deborahs and the Judiths. MONDAY. Karl is getting terriblmy jealous. I suppose Mar- garet must show by her manner that he is very little    42     CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. to her. A careless disregard of a man, as if what he thought or said or did was a matter of no import- ance, is more aggravating to most of us than even jealous reproaches. The latter may be annoy- ing, but they minister to self-love; the former pro- yokes self-love-and all men have plenty of that weakness-beyond endurance. I have cautioned Margaret against undue praise of- me add this disdainful treatment of Karl. But she is naturally, one of the sincerest of human beings-. It is intolerably irksome to her to restrni the free expression of her thoughts and emotions,:#nd to af- fect an interest she does not feel. "a Karl is nothing now to her," she says. "She is simply his house- keeper, and she tries to be a good one. He may be as affectionate to her as he will, and can. The out- ward is his. But her soul is her own; and it is in Eden, where he is not." The congregation begin to talk too. Margaret's admiration and almost worship of her Pastor at first amused them, as the unrestrained ardor of a young, impulsive girl; now they begin to censure it, and be suspicious of it in the wedded woman. I must be doubly cautious, as it seems difficult for Margaret to be cautious at all.   DIARY.         43 MONDAY. The Scripture lesson yesterday included the story of David and the wife of Uriah. Ohe year ago how clearly could I have analyzed and how freely expa- tiated upon the whole story. But now it appears to me in a new and more dubious light. I bungled through however, according to the general mode of thinking. But was David so very wrong as I used to think? In the frst plaice it is evident that Bathsheba tempted him. She doubtless knew the King's custom of walking at eventide upon the roof of his house-why then did she not choose a more private place for her ablutions? Besides, if it was so very wrong, why did God smile upon their union to the extent of blessing it with the issue of Solomon, the wisest of men? Could wisdom spring from the wickedest folly? The King repented, we are told, but he still kept Bathsheba; and Solomon her son became King at his father's death. These things puzzle me as they never did before. Have I then been eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and thus gaining wisdom, even if incurring the penalty of death? "Keep thy eye single," says the Scripture. This may be the :pleasantest course, but to see things as   "    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. they are, is it not wisest to use both eyes, that one may correct the errors of the other? In the old tiine I looked at David simply from one point of view-now I feel compelled to regard him also from another, the point of sympathy. The result is that the whole matter appears more confused-my sense of his wrong-doing lessens. Of course that murder fof Uriah was a very wicked business, although' the Prophet does not seem to dwell as much upon that as upon the other. I think his parable would have been stronger if he had said that not only did the rich man take the poor man's one cherished ewe- lamb, but also slew the poor man for remonstrating against it. But he says nothing until afterwards of this greater crime, for which David was justly pun- ished by the dissensions among his children and the rebellion of Absalom.  I believe in individual freedom. Can one person rightfully make himself the slave for life of another? Can he or she at twenty-one years of age, rightfully make a bargain to bind himself or herself until death? It seems doubtful to me. Does!not the power to make include the power to iltmake? At forty I may be an entirely different being, both in body and mind, from what I was at twenty. My   DIARY.         45 tastes may be different, my habits and beliefs may be different. Suppose that a man were to agree at twenty-one that he would always remain a member of a certain religious sect--any one-should such an un- wise promise hold him to that church if he thought best to leave it? Suppose he were to promise and even take an oath always to remain a subject of France or Germany, would that oath legally or mor- ally hold him, if he thought it best to become a citi- zen of America?  Have not all- promises, made however sacredly, their natural limit, in the nature and reason of things? Why then should marriage be an exception? Why should unwilling partners be bound together until death? Why should it not be right for a woman to break a union which has become as a galling yoke, arid seek a more congenial relation with the man of her maturer choice? WEDNESDAY. I have returned from a pastoral visit to Margaret. She is in trouble. Karl has made up his mind to take a two or three iondths', trip. He says he needs it, and that Mdlargatr's heialth ouiild be bettered by   "    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. it. She is becoming thinner and paler. This con- stant state of excitement, growing out of her divided and inharmonious relations, is telling upon her strength. Margaret said that she had told Karl she would not go. He might go when he pleased, and where he pleased, but she would remain at home. Karl threw out hints that suggested jealous thoughts, and said he would not stir a step unless she accompanied him. He added that his physician had advised him to travel, to guard against a tendency to consumption that he inherited; but perhaps the wisest thing he could do was to stay at home and die, for then his wife would be free of him forever. What could Margaret say? She with her consci- entiousness and sincerity.- She could not deny that she would like to be free; but, of course, she could cherish no wish based on injury to Karl. He was not to blame for anything. No one was to blame. It was the result of youthful unwisdom of which she had to complain; her own as well as his. In fact, she, as being the woman, was the one who ought to have known better. She ought to have felt from the first that Karl was not her destined mate. After consideration I could but advise her to go with   DIARY.          47 Karl, that is in case she found he was resolute in not going without her. Something was due to him under the circumstances of the case, even at some cost to herself If she could no longer give him her love, she should at least give him what she could, wifely courtesy and attention. It was her cross, and she must bear it. Margaret belongs to that class of women, to whom the idea of taking up any cross seems rather to give pleasure than pain. They seem to be designed by nature for martyrs. She would never do a wrong thing merely because it was pleasant to her. Where she doubted between two paths, one pleasant and the other painful, she would certainly take the latter. Not because it is pleasant to love me does she wilfully do it. It is because she feels an overmastering love for me in her heart, that she esteems it her duty to act in accordance therewith, as she would obey, in any other case, what seemed the voice of God in the soul. Satisfy her that any course is right, and she will walk in that course, even if the way led through burning flames to death. So she finally saw it in the light of her duty to agree to accompany Karl. She thinks they will probably go in a few days, as he is very anxious to be     48     CONFESSIONS ,OF A MNISTER. off; to go anywhere, he says, to get away for a while from Berlin, It was painful, but sweet, my parting with Marga- ret. If ever man was loved and revered by a woman, I am by her. If ever man loved a woman truly, I truly love her. What would we not sacrifice for each other! Oh, long and sad will be the days to both of us until she returns. She has promised to write me as often as she can. Blessed saints, guard her, and bring her home safely! What would life be without Margaret I THURSDAY. I received this morning the following letter. I carelessly put it into my breast pocket, and said I would open it at my leisure. My wife, who took it from the post-bag, glanced at its superscription, and simply said, "I see it is from Margaret." That was all she said, then she went on talking with the children. I have often wondered if she suspects anything. If she does, she does not show it by a word, ,tone, a look. She is always kind to Marga- ret. Nvder hesitates -t go out and leave us together.   DIARY.         49 Has she perfect confidence in me, and does she love me too much, or does she not love me enough, to be jealous? Now I think of it, I notice that of late her tones have been softer and kinder, especially when talking to me, than they used to be. Occa- sionally I look up and catch her eyes bent upon me, full of the tenderest and most solicitous affection. It seems to me that she is more like the Gertrude of twenty years ago, within the last few months. She cannot suspect anything, for though an angel might act with such divine self-abnegation, so would not a woman, not even Margaret, much less Gertrude. But Margaret's letter. It was as follows: "DEAR HUSBAND OF MY SOUL:-As the railway train whirled me away from you it seemed tearing me apart from all that constitutes my highest life. Karl called my attention to the scenery; I could see noth- ing with my outward eyes; all my gaze was inward, bent upon you, grandest and noblest of men. How above all the common littleness of humanity was your advice, counselling this separation. You seem to live and move in a sphere far above the ordinary weaknesses of the spirit. I can only soar to that etherial summit where you dwell habitually. 4   50    %CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. "I foresee that I shall have a dull, sad time for the next few months; a kind of purgatory of stupidity. But this life has to be worn out, and why not as well in this way as any other? In the glorious hereafter, I shall be united eternally to you. Our spirits shall range together over the vast etherial spaces. We shall be happy, because we shall be together. What bliss, what unspeakable rapture in the thought! "Think of me as I think of you, daily; hourly, constantly. Not a moment is your beloved presence absent in spirit from me. Kiss the cornelian heart I gave you once, and I shall feel the kisses on my lips. If I can, my spirit shall visit you in your slumbers, and embrace you. Forever your MARGARET. " Could any one wonder that I should read and re- read such a letter? What a depth and constancy of affection breathes forth from every line! It is the proof of kindred souls, wedded because of their pe- culiar spiritual affinity; that no time nor absence can impair the depth and devotion of their love. They turn to each other as the magnet and the iron. It is a result of qualities which inhere in their very In-, stitution, and while they are what they are, those - X   DIARY.         51 qualities and their result must also always exist. I Thus there can be no change where hearts are i wedded in a true and natural spiritual union. It is i only where the union is a mere joining of hands, a mere outward marriage, not a true union of spirit j with spirit, and soul with soul, that there is any X liability to, or possibility of change. I see Margaret t leave me without a fear, for she cannot travel where { she is beyond the reach of my spirit; -where my  thought cannot reach her in a moment, swifter than i the magnetic current traverses the iron wire. The ! spiritual world is full of such invisible wires, leading i from sympathetic heart to heart. There is one i stretching now between my heart and Margaret's. i In an instant I can communicate with her. Yes, in i a deeper and truer sense than the world reads it, the inspired penman was right when he wrote, "I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine!" MONDAY. I have strange news. There has been an awful disaster on the Rhine. But, the telegraphic account   52     CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER;.  says, she is safe. And Karl also is safe. I anxiously await further tidings. TUESDAY. Fuller accounts this morning. The steamboat they were on took fire, became unmanageable, and stuck fast on a sand-bank or a rock near the middle of the river. The account in the paper says, "Karl von Stein be- haved like a hero. He saved many lives, including his-wife's. At last, trying to save a little girl, he nearly lost his own life, being picked up by a small boat at the last moment, when entirely exhausted. He was brought ashore 4in an insensible condition. Crowds flock constantly to the house to know whether he has recovered. The women whose children he saved are praying for him in the churches. If he lives, the citizens of Cologne will present him' with a gold medal suitably inscribed." I am glad to read this of Karl. He always was a noble fellow, cast in the old heroic mould. Int l- lectual pursuits are not exactly his sphere; but for brave striving and doing in the world of men, whether in business, adventure or war, I think few   DIARY.          5 could surpass him if he seriously set himself to labo: and achieve. Margaret will like him the better fo; it too, and not think so meanly of him. FRIDAY. I have a letter from Margaret. It is a very long one. She gives me a full account of all that has taken place. It must have been an awful scene. Fire on the boat, the deep waves outside, and no ap- parent means of escape but a  few life-preservers, and the settees, doors, etc. Karl was away from her when the flames broke out, but he dashed through them, and having found an india-rubber life-preserver, fastened it beneath her shoulders, gave her a large chair, and told her to be ready to spring into the water when the flames ap- proached too near.' Then he dove through the black smoke into the cabin, and succeeded in finding some twenty more life-preservers, which he gave to as many women and children-showing them how to use them. Many of the other men, on board were unmarried, and most of them seemed frightened into either stupidity or cowardice. As the flames ap-   54    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. proached, Karl with a hatchet and a bar of iron wrested off pieces of the light wood-work of the railing, and throwing them with all the chairs, stools and settees into the water, lowered the women and children after them. Nearly all that had the life preservers thus were enabled to escape. Many of the others were unable to keep up until assistance reached them from the shore. Finally he attempted one deed of mercy too much, and was just on the point of sinking, utterly exhausted, when a boat came up and drew him almost lifeless out of the water, She herself had entirely recovered from the fright and the exposure, but Karl still lay in a very weak state, and his physicians were afraid of typhoid fever. Margaret's letter ends as follows:-You cannot imagine, my dear pastor, how changed my feelings are toward Karl.  That I owe to him, under God, my life, seems comparatively a small matter. But I had no idea, no approach to an idea, how grand and noble and heroic he was. -'All the women envy me such a husband.  The mothers of the children he saved would almost go down on their knees and worship him, were he able to leave his room. They talk of giving him a gold medal. Some say that the King will give him the badge of   DIARY.         55 the High Order of Merit. But he, poor fellow, knows nothing of all this. He lies in a weak, half- insensible state from hour to hour. Of course the physicians are doing everything they can for him, and I am putting all my skill as a nurse into requisi- tion. After saving so many lives, he must not be allowed to die himself. But I am called, and must go. Yours in the greatest haste, MARGARET. How selfish we men are. Even after such a scene as that, and with Karl needing her services so much at every moment, I cannot help feeling a little pain at the difference in tone between this letter and the one that preceded it. I forget that all her energies are now necessarily absorbed in the outward duties of that outward sphere where I do not move and reign. When her mind has had time to recover its equilibrium, then she will write again as my Mar- garet. No slight shock could have altered thus the common flow of her being, her constant life in the inward and spiritual. But this is like an earth- quake in her life. She must perforce act now for a time almost wholly in the outward, in taking care of and nursing Karl, in responding to the inquiries   56     CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. and kind offers of strangers, in acting the part of the husband in many things as well as of the wife. Karl will probably soon recover, and relieve her from the necessity of this last, and gradually, or perhaps at once, her thoughts will revert to their old interior channels. Thus earthquakes often divert the waterso of the sea and the rivers from their accustomed bed, but, the shock once over, they return into their old courses and boundaries. MONDAY. Another letter from Margaret, this time to Ger-I trude. It is full of Karl, his continued sickness, his wonderful courage, the great praise he has received, the public sympathy, and incloses ax copy of a note from the King, expressing his admiration of Karl's heroism. She begs to be kindly remembered to me. WEDNESDAY.  I Can it be Margaret that writes the following?  MY DEAR PASTOR:-Karl is still very ill. If he ' should die I should never forgive myself. Why did     i I   DIARY.         57 I accede to his request to come on this ill-starred journey?  How could you, whom I have always thought so wise, have recommended it? It seems months and years, instead of weeks, since we left home. So much has passed since then. I have been in a whirl of duties and of intercourse with strangers, ever since that dreadful, triumphant day. Oh, Karl! never did the world see greater unselfish- ness, greater heroism! Poor fellow-the larger portion of the time he lies half-conscious, saying nothing. - At other times he is entirely out of his mind. Yesterday he commenced wringing his hands, and imploring me to send Mar- garet to him, that he might see her once more, and tell her how much he loved her, before he died. I answered that I was Margaret. He said I could not deceive him in that way, Margaret had either per- ished in the flames, or left him for another whom she loved far better. I told him again that I was Mar- garet, and that I would never leave him. He burst into tears and said I was not Margaret, that Margaret would never watch over him as I had done-that she had once loved him, but that she loved him no longer. I finally succeeded in comforting him, and he fell asleep. Oh, my friend, if he should die now, ^   58     CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. I could never forgive myself. I .should be utterly miserable. Heretofore, we have, both of us, underrated Karl. I did not see that because he was not bookish, it did not necessarily follow that he was nothing. I see now that he has his own native sphere, the sphere of ac- tion-if need be, daring action! And is not action greater than mere words? What do the poets and his- torians write about? The great deeds of great men. Is the minstrel who sings of the deeds of a hero, as great as the hero himself? I think not. Karl is of the stuff that heroes are made of. Suppose, he cannot write a poem or a book--he can do deeds worthy of poems and books. Already have there been several poems written in eulogy of his late heroic actions. But I hear a faint voice call ' Margaret." Fare- well-as ever your true friend, MARGARET. So ends that dream. And the injustice of saddling me with any of the blame of his journey and its disaster! As if I had not only counselled unwisely but selfishy; when if she would call to mind the whole conversation, and the circumstances of the )case, she would own, if there is any fairness left in   DIARY.         t woman, that my counsel was not only honestlyut unselfishy given. And so Margaret, with all her wonderful and beau- tiful qualities, has the woman's peculiar weakness of unfairness after all. 0e thing I will say for Ger- trude, she is as fair and\just as a man. Of not one woman in a thousand, so far as my experience goes, can that be said. Wonderful-how can I credit it-that I should ever be writing thus of Margaret, she, who was my soul's idol, and who seemed incomparably above all other women! But this is not Margaret, the Mar- garet I knew, who wrote that letter. It is the Mar- garet that loved and wedded Karl. And now I understand that piece of folly, which, perhaps, was not altogether so foolish as I recently thought it. Of course she is not entirely wrong as to the thinker and the doer. She is entirely right, perhaps, as to the mere writer and the doer. But I hold that a great thought is greater than a great deed. A great thought is a great deed. It is the little mustard seed which grows into a mighty tree, and its branches over- shadow the earth. Many men have done heroic deeds, and founded dynasties that endured for cen- turies. But the quiet men who in the depths of tic .  i             *   60     CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. their vast souls conceive great thoughts, give birth to the great political and religious beliefs whichaule the world for ages. No man ever swayed the mil- lions of mankind as the great thoughts of the thinker have swayed the. Great thoughts rule with a rod of iron the great doers themselves. The masses of mankind will toil and suffer and hunger and thirst, and go to their deaths through fire and flood and battle for a great thought. Yes, Karl is a doer. I admit it. He is a hero. But I am a thinker, and am not ashamed of my call- ing, for it is the highest in the world. Shall I write this to Margaret? Shall I seek to raise myself in her good graces by magnifying myself?, Perish the thought. It is unworthy of me. "I am ! what I am," putting aside my failings, "by the Grace \ of God.", And I do not fear comparison with any of the vaunted doers; ,even those that are far greater i than Karl.                     \ As I read the last lines I have written, I own to - their vanity.

The lover should write only poems and novels; his mind has not the judicial calmness which alone is )suitable for history. MONDAY. Margaret and Karl are again at home. Gertrude and I have just returned from their residence. Karl is still very weak; unable some days to leave his room.  He received me very pleasantly. He bears his honors meekly; said that it amused him to hear people make so much of such a simple matter. He- roism always seems simple and natural to the heroic. If the mass of men were heroic, there would be no heroes; only true men and dastards. What a change has come over Margaret! In every word and gesture, in her attention to all Karl says, to his slightest wish, even to his unexpressed desires, one can see that she is really enamored of him. If I were a vain man, which I hope I am not, my good opinion of myself would have been nicely taken down to-day. Doers and deeds are every thing now with Margaret; thinkers and thoughts, nothing. I am her old pastor, Dr. Leonhardt, a dear friend, that   62    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. is all. An unpalatable dish this truly, after what has been. And I would be :more or less than man not to own that it is very bitter to my taste. As We walked home, Gertrude suddenly laughed out. She laughs but seldom; but her laugh is one of her charms, it is so peculiar, yet withal so sweet, innocent and joyous, like a young girl's. "What is it?" said I, "let me have some of the fun that is going." ELI was only thinking what curious changeable beings most women are," she replied. "An instance?" "'Oh, Margaret. Did you note how Karl has risen in her estimation since his heroic actions? She is as careful of him, and as tender towards him as if he were her baby." "I noticed it," I replied, also laughing, I am afraid a little grimly. "All Margaret's heroes hereafter must be at least six feet high, and have the physical strength and agility only acquired by long practice in the gymna- sium," continued Gertrude, smiling. I said noth- ing. I am not so tall as Karl by several inches, and could not pretend to match him at saving women and children from burning wrecks.   DIARY.    .     63 "For my part," continued Gertrude, "I know a horse or an elephant is considerably larger and stronger than a man, and yet I value the man most." "Ah, Gertrude," I replied, lightly, "you have not a hero for a husband." "No, but something higher and better," she an- swered, warmly. I knew Gertrude felt Margaret's change of manner towards me, and wife-like, was a little indignant at her husband's not being appreciated at his full value. Ah, if she knew all! I could but feel a little pang in my bosom to think that I was so unfaithful in heart to this woman, who felt any slight to me more keenly than she would a slight to herself. 'It would be rather pleasanter to me, under the circumstances, to know that she wasted very little feeling upon me. I remember that one day she quoted, half approv- r  ingly, the old saying, "If I love you, what is that to you?"   Would she love me still if she knew all? I should not be .greatly surprised if it were so, for in constancy she is one woman in ten thousand. I question whether any change in me would seem to her a sufficient reason for a change in her. Besides, she has wonderfully high ideas of a wife's position and duty. She does not admit the rightfulness of divorce   "    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. for any reason; although she does the rightfulness and duty of personal separation, in uch cases as habitual intemperance and insanity, where the wel- fare of children is concerned. Gertrude in truth, whatever else I may think of her, is a thoroughly good, unselfish and noble woman, and possessed of a clear and penetrating intellect in all things with which the affections are concerned. FRIDAY. What folly, what madness possesses Margaret? Is she losing all sense, all sanity, all judgment? I have just received this letter, handed me privately by her maid. MY DEAR PASTOR:-Now that it is over I fear I have not been wise and prudent; but I think it only right I should let you know, at the earliest moment, what confidences have passed between me and my beloved Karl. Karl and myself, last evening, had the fullest reconciliation. He wished to talk over the past, to excuse himself for "many foolish things that he had said and done," to use his own words, and to "'^ '* A. * ".-'   DIARY.        65 thank me for being so kind and patient and forbear- ing and faithful to him through it all. It cut me to the heart, to hear him thus accuse himself, and imply that he, on his part, had nothing to forget and for- give. I imprudently made one or two admissions, which led on to others. He questioned me closely, but kindly. You know the thoughtless sincerity of my nature. The moment was one of spiritual enthu- siasm, of exalted love. I was reclining upon Karl's bosom, his arms were around -me. The magnetism of his mighty nature seemed to absorb and control all my wishes, all my will. I answered all his ques- tions. I confessed all my faithlessness. I implored his pardon. Only when I felt Karl's hand growing cold as ice around mine, and felt his breath coming short and hot against my cheek, did I waken to what I had done. Then I remembered you. I implored him, I commanded him to allow all things to be as if I had never spoken. If he took one hostile step towards you, I threatened--and I shall keep my word--to leave him that moment. If he could not forgive me fully and at once, I would leave him then and for- ever. Karl said that he had not a thought of blame fari 5   "    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. me.  I was young, you were my spiritual adviser, and on you rested the sole responsibility of the wrong. I let him have his say, because it seemed to pacify him, but of course this is not true. I acted under a mistake, but it was my mistake as much as yours, if not more. I did wrong, and am ready to take my full share of the responsibility here on earth, and at the dreadful judgment-seat of God. I shall strive by my devotion to Karl to repay him, and make amends to the Eternal Father, for my transgres- sion. All my excuse is, that I was under a delusion, of my own perverse heart, or of Satan. I think it right you should know that Karl knows all. But have no fear. He has promised me sol- emnly not to attempt to harm you in any way, in person, property, or reputation. I shall insist upon his keeping his word. You have this security for it, that he is a man of honor, and that he will not do any thing to incur my serious displeasure, for he worships the very ground I walk on. I could hardly keep him yesterday from imitating that wild Polish custom, and drinking his wine out of the slipper which he snatched from my foot. He says that if I were again to frown on him, it would drive him crazy, and I believe it would. But I could not   DIARY.         ( lightly frown upon him, my hero, my beloved! As this will probably be the last letter I shall eve address to you, I shall sign myself, with the most fel vent wishes for your future happiness, your sincer friend,             MARGARET. P. S.-I return with this all your letters. Karl ha not seen them, and I mean to put it out of my powe ever to show them to him. Not falsely have men always said, "A woman can not keep a secret." I knew it was true of women generally, but in my infatuation I supposed that Mar garet was an exception. No, they cannot keep a secret, not even when it affects their own reputation' "Frailty, thy name is woman!" To be a mere babbler and blabber, to tell what it is not necessary should be told, what it is of the greatest importance should not be told; from which evil, and evil only can come when told, to the teller and to everybody connected with her, this it is which makes a man scorn himself for ever having wor- shipped a woman. They will all do it-all of them will do it. Or if not all, ninety-nine in the hundred. Beware, young man, how you trust any important   68    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. secret to the weak lips of that tattling and treacher-' ous sex. It will burn in their memories like a bright coin in a boy's pocket, until it is parted with. Though it may be like a caged tiger or hyena, yet will they let it out, in some weak, irresolute moment, to ravage and devour. Some prompting of vanity says, show your husband how the wealthy merchant, the eloquent lawyer, the gifted author admires you,-- tell him what foolish words of love, in some foolish moment, have been said to you; prove -to him thus how precious you ought to be in his sight, what a veritable diamond he possesses. Perhaps the result may be the death of two noble men, either of whom was of tenfold more value than the weak and silly creature who inflamed them against each other. But even this will minister to hler puerile vanity, to think that for her empty, surface beauty, brave men have died. cOf all the curses in the world, save me from the curse of a tattling woman!" so have I often said in years past, as divisions and jealousies and bickerings have sprung up in my congregation, at the bottom of which some female babbler and blabber was always to be found, squatting there like the toad which poured its leprous distilment of mischievous thoughts I   DIARY.         69 into the sleeping ear of Eve. And now the woman whom  I worshipped so devotedly-of whom  I thought as my spiritual partner and eternal compan- ion in the world to come-for whom I have done that for which the only excuse could be the truest and highest love-has betrayed me-has proved herself, with all her angelic qualities, only a common tattler and blabber! Heavens, it is enough to make a man forswear the sex forever, as incapable-the best of them-of keep- ing a guard over their silly, prattling tongues! Tell Karl! Why tell Karl? Granting it was sinful, what good could possibly come of telling Karl, and risk- ing a full exposure to the world? If we have done wrong, let us repent of it. It is bitter enough to feel that one has fallen from his high estate, and that God and the angels know it, and that Satan and his devils know it. But to betray it to the world, when no possible good could come from such betrayal- when what is done can never be undone-wounding all connected with you, wounding anew the wronged husband and the wronged wife, and casting dishonor upon children and relatives and friends-what pos- sible excuse can there be for such wickedness, save idiocy or madness?   70    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. If she cannot keep her own secret, how can she expect Karl to keep it? She had it safe within her. own bosom. Then she was certain of it. But the moment it was spoken, no tears, no entreaties could again give it into her possession. It is a ravening wolf-she had it chained securely. The chain once unloosed, her days of security, my days of security are over. And is Karl helped? In no way. Never again can he have the same certain confidence in-her. She that has failed him once, may fail again. He can never renew the old trust, no matter how much he may wish to. There are some things that are beyond the power of the will, even when it is -inspired by love.  She has thus planted a root of bitterness in Karlf breast, that will never die. She has ruined my peace, whom she once professed to love. She has ruined Karl's peace, whom she now says she loves. She has ruined her own peace, for she will feel here- after that Karl can never truly and fully trust her. She has ruined the peace of Gertrude, my much-en- during wife. She has mingled bitterness with the lives of hundreds of relatives and friends. And she has cast dishonor upon my children, and if she ever have any, upon her own.   DIARY.        -- 71 On the other side, what good has she done that car bear comparison with the evil? Is there an avenging Nemesis in all this, o which she is but the poor tool and puppet? Ii what we have done something so sinful in its char acter that like murder it must out? I give-the woman I have loved the benefit of the excuse, al though I believe it not. Even murder will not "out" always. I have known many a case where the mystery was never un veiled-where the perpetrator was never discovered- where the silence of the grave ever rested around the murderer as unbroken as upon his victim. But well I know that in our case, the seal of silence once broken, it can never be restored. Nothing hereafter is secure--person, property, or fair fame Trouble, endless trouble, lies before me. Trouble worse and harder to bear than death. Oh, hov gladly would I hear at this moment the voice of the Death Angel in my soul, saying, "Put thine house in order, for thou shalt die and not live." (For, like David, far rather would I fall into the hands of God who understands me as I am, with all my tempta tions and weaknesses, than into the hands of narrow minded, uncharitable men.   72    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. MONDAY. 'It is three months since that last letter of Mar- garet's. I see too well that the wolf is unchained. Nothing yet has been said to me, but I have heard Karl and Margaret slightingly spoken of by those who have ever been my most devoted supporters in the congregation. It is evident that Karl has cast some slurs upon me, and that these, my friends, re- sent it. Thus the breach will insensibly widen into a quarrel, of which I shall be the cause and centre. If I counsel patience and forbearance to my over- zealous friends, I shall be straightway extolled by them   as a marvellous personification of all the virtues; if I let things run their course, they will run on into an open rupture. Oh, that I had never known Margaiet, or never allowed myself to become infatuated with her! Yes, I admit now that it was infatuation. Her love was not able to stand the test of Karl's heroism and celebrity. My love was not able to stand the test of her falling off, and of her weakness in disclosing so momentous a secret. How absurd many portions of my diary read to me now! A spiritual union, married for eternity, kindred spirits united by affinity of soul-how foolish it all sounds in   DIARY.         73 the light of events, and of our present feelings to- ward each other. I am not certain that I ever truly loved her as much as I once loved and even still love Gertrude, who may not be so radiantly beautiful, nor so enthusiastic, but who, I am sure, is neither fickle nor a blabber. TUESDAY. Curiously enough, I picked up yesterday in one of my disused drawers, a sermon that I wrote many years ago, when I was a young man, and full of the purity and freshness and enthusiasm of youth. Still more curious, it wds upon the "Married Life of the Christian." I had forgotten that I ever wrote such a sermon. I can hardly credit now that I ever wrote it, the ideas seem so novel to me, the views so striking. And yet there really is nothing very new or striking in them, it is simply the old, old doctrine, clothed with the crimson and gold and purple hues wih which the morning sun of youth enfolds all it touches. Could I ever have been that youth, so full of pur- ity, so full of fervent sense of duty, so full of holi-   I     w Gvs *t- A.1w3 , 5vr A VAlN10-1 JtLK. ness? Men say I am wise, and I think myself I have taken the inspired penman's advice, and gotten wisdom, but would it not be better, if I could, to exchange a large portion of that wisdom for the young man's pure and childlike heart? It seems to me I see more clearly than ever before, in the light of my vanished youth, as shown in this old ser- mon, why it is necessary that we should become as the Saviour said, like little children, and even be born again, if need be, in a spiritual sense, in order that the great end of being like a little child may be attained. lLet me recur to that picture of the "Married Life of the Christian." What did it say? "The Christian husband will -be the faithful hus- band of one woman. If possible she will be the wife of his youth, the woman of all others to whom his youthful heart is drawn. This will make her sacred forever in his eyes, she will be united in his thoughts with those days when simply to live was a blessing, iwhen the world had not yet pressed too heavily upon' him, when Hope sung her sweetest strain, when the capacity for Love was at its highest and its fullest. "As the two grow old together, they will grow more and more into harmony and unison.  Becom- t  } v    DIARY.         75 ing accustomed to that harmony and unison, they may not always be conscious of it,- and yet no less it will be true--a divine reality. The old do not read- ily assimilate, either in the outward or the inward life. They have become hard and inflexible. There- fore the marriage of youth is more apt to prove the true marriage. "They will be faithful to each other--and why? Because each is pledged before God so to be, and be. cause each expects faithfulness. Can you fairly de- mand what you are not willing to give in return? And yet this is a low reason. You will be faithful because it is in accordance -with the harmony oi things, End the natural instincts of all highly devel- oped spirits. You will be faithful therefore, because the voice of God speaking in the inmost depths of the soul, says, BE FAITHFUL-FOR I AM FAr'lt/iuL! ," You, and especially the woman, will also be faithful, for your children's sake. That they may never feel a doubt as to who their parents really are, and never fail of their claim to a parent's care. What right have you to bring children into the world with the taint of shame upon their brows? You have heard of the curse of a father--it is a fearful thing--but not less fearful are the righteous curses of   children upon those who have dared to beget them into a life of shame. Therefore be faithful--and ye, oh mothers, especially be faithful--for- your child- ren's sake; lest, while living, they learn to curse you for your weakness and your folly, and to curse the very day they were born." So runs that youthful sermon. It seems a singular one for a young man to deliver. And I remember now that it never was delivered, and that is the rea- son, I suppose, that I had forgotten all about it. A reverend senior advised me to put it by until I was some twenty years older; he said it was very good, but such sermons sounded best from the lips of older men. Has this sermon been providentially kept from my hand until this day? Is it intended that I shall de- liver it now, or base another sermon upon it? Won-; derful are Thy ways, oh Lord God! WEDNESDAY. As I passed Hugo, Karl's brother, to-day on the street, I thought I caught the half-muttered epithet, "hypocrite!" It stung through me like the bite of I      -       .   an adder. I a hypocrite! God pity me, that ever any man should have the least show of a cause to call me that. Of all terms of reproach that seems to me the keenest. Hypocrite! God knows that whatever else I may be, I am no hypocrite. I may be a sinful, miserable wretch, but hypocrisy is not among my failings. What is a hypocrite? A man who preaches one thing and practises another. If I were in the constant practice of preaching any commandment, and in the equally constant practice of violating it-moreover, did I preach it in order that I might the better and more securely violate it--then I might justly be called a hypocrite. But this is not true of me. Heaven knows it is not true. I may have greatly erred-let me honestly write it, I have greatly erred-I have done what I should not have done--I have sinned, and come short of my high calling, and of the glory of the righteous man, but I have not used, and do not use my sacred office as a cloak for wrong doing. Stay. Have I not used my sacred office as a cloak for wrong doing? Let me not be a liar, that is as bad as being a hypocrite. Let me say I did not purposely do it perhaps, but I certainly did do it. 1h   78    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. How else could I have had so many secret opportu- nities with Margaret? To one not a Minister such opportunities would not have been allowed. Oh, Father of Mercies! have I then, who despise the name and the thing so much, really acted the Hypo- crite? Father and God! I prostrate myself in my agony before Thy heavenly throne. I have been proud and high-minded, and exulted in my strength, and Thou hast allowed me to walk in mine own way. I have been deceived by the weakness and wickedness of my own heart, and have fallen into the snares of the Evil one. I have sinned against my neighbor and agnst Thee. I have violated Thy most holy com- mandment. I have acted the lowest and meanest of all parts, that of the hypocrite. Oh, Father, suffer me not to fall still further. Pardon me my wrong- doing, and help me hereafter to lead a righteous life. Guide me and keep my heart pure amid the seduc- tions of the world, the flesh, and the devil. And finally raise me above the power of death, hell and the grave, through Thy own infinite mercy, shining in the face of Jesus Christ our Lord!-   DIARY.         79 -FRIDAY. I begin to feel calmer. I fear the whirlwind must come; but I will meet it like a man and a Christian. Hereafter I trust to act as my best and highest nature prompts, and as my Heavenly Father may bid me, through the voice of conscience in the heart. I have had enough of wrong doing, and shall make no false pretences, tell no lies, even if the worst comes. At the very worst, all the world can but desert me. Karl's pistol--death-I would welcome these. Death has no terror in his fearful eyes equal to that in the averted eyes of my friends. Were it lawful, I would not live another day in the world. But I will neither act the liar nor the coward. If the bitter cup is allowed by a wise and merciful God to be placed to my lips, shall I not drink it? Perhaps that may be an atonement for my sin. And Gertrude may leave me, as all my friends undoubtedly will. Though I think not Gertrude. And yet it may destroy the future harmony of our lives. Well, this I suppose, too, must be a part of the expiation. One however, I am sure, will not desert me. 'He who never deserted those who, even at the last moment, put their trust in Him. He that bruises not the broken , reed, and who has said, " a contrite heart I will not   80    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER.. despise." (Ah, the multitude may and will scoff and sneer over my disgrace, as if they were perfectly pure, and never did a wrong thing; but God and the holy angels, and all truly righteous men will pity and, perhaps, in time, pardon.  MONDAY. A letter from Karl. If he has not absolutely broken his promise of silence to Margaret, he has forgotten or evaded it. It is bitter enough:- DR. LEONHARDT: YOU have done me the most grievous wrong that one man can do another. If I  were to shoot you, most men would hold me justified. But I have promised Margaret I would not harm you, and the promise of a man of honor, unlike that of a minister, is sacred. I had a pure and loving wife; she was devoted to me as I to her. You, taking advantage of your sa- cred office, stole into my house as the serpent into Eden, and poisoned my sweet wife's mind against me.

Fortunately, and in spite of all your strongest efforts, as Margaret confesses, I succeeded in getting her away from Berlin, and be- yond the sphere of your baneful influence. Then Margaret came to herself. She reflected with horror into what an abyss of sin you had lured her. And ever since has been again my most loving, devoted and faithful wife. Poor girl! I do not hold her the least accountable for what occurred. She asked for my forgiveness, A   -but I told her forgiveness was for thserilfully errings and only compassion for the deluded and misguided. But I look upon you as upon the spirit of a Mephis- topheles, allowed again to roam upon the earth to deceive and betray. If you have not the cloven hoof, you ought to have, and it has only been omitted to make your disguise the more complete. A man of your age, too, old enough to be her father, and who should be thinking of the terrors of the next world, instead of the joys of the present. As I said, I promised Margaret not to injure you in the least, and the promise of a man of honor is sacred. But I feel that it is no violation of that promise, as it may in fact save you from even a deeper hell than that to which you will inevitably go, to de- 6   82    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. mand, and that in the most imperative manner, that you at once abandon the ministry, and descend from the pulpit that you have disgraced. For a man who has sinned so grossly as you nave, to set himself up as a spiritual light and guide to others, is not only an impertinence, but the vilest hypocrisy. If you are not lost to all sense of shame, a decent regard for the proprieties of life will lead you to forsake at once the ministry, and throwing off your sacred robes, clothe yourself for a season in more appro- priate sackcloth and ashes.  Yours, in serious earnest, KARL. He writes like an angry boy, but with the bitter- ness of a man. Yet, is what he asks entirely unreas- onable? Ought I to go on preaching to others, who am myself so much of a castaway? Well I know that it has not weakened my power to counsel my sinful fellow men. In truth, I seem even more fitted to counsel because I have been myself so deluded into sin. And I feel brought into a spirit- ual closeness to all the multitude of wrong-doers, which I never was conscious of before. From the depths of my own guilt can I speak to them now with a power and a pathos that must move their hearts.   DIARY.         83 For I know now how easily the heart may be misled, and how it may be scarcely conscious of its danger until it finds itself plunged into a gulf of blackness and burning from which all recovery seems im- possible. Surely I am better fitted to counsel and exhort the sinner, since I have - found myself to be one of the chief of sinners, than when I believed myself immac- ulate and pure. And yet, what would I have said upon this very question three years ago? Then I was in a healthy state, and my judgment probably sound. Now, I am sin-tainted, and may it not impair the soundness and clearness of my judgment? Peter denied the Lord, but repented, and con- tinued to be the chief of the Apostles. Judas be- trayed the Lord, and repented-and went and hanged himself. It may be that a sinful man can speak with most power to sinful men--but will they heed h if they know that he is also a sinner. Will theft say, "Physician, heal thyself? Thou that sayeat a man should not steal, dost thou steal? Thou that preachest, do not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? If thou dost, silence were more becoming to thee."   84    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. Is not Karl right, that a decent respect for the proprieties of life should of itself close the pulpit to me, at least until sufficient time has elapsed to purge me, in some degree, of my sin? But what shall I do for a maintenance? I have had a liberal salary, and my family are accustomed to living liberally. Never have I inown what it is to want for money. I might find a vacant Professor- ship, perhaps-but the salaries of Professors are small, and the empty chairs few Still, considerations of this kind should not deter me from doing my duty. For myself, of course, should care little; but for Gertrude and the children! there's the rub. A man cannot fall without dragging down his wife and children into the mire with him. MONDAY. Gertrude has just left me. She burst into my study a little while since with an open letter in her hand. "Only think of it, dear Joseph," she said, "your wife is an heiress. Read this letter."

"You did not think your little wife would ever turn up an heiress--or did you in your-great wisdom, and are you simply reaping now where you. have  sown?" and she laughed sweetly. ', No, I had not the least expectation of it." "You built wiser than you knew, then, and you are a rich man this day, just out of sheer good luck." "You are a rich woman, Gertrude, you mean. You do not think I shall take your money?" "Why not, when the law and common sense and your little wife all unite in giving it to you?" I put my arm around her, and drew her on my lap and kissed her. This sweet, natural generosity of my wife's touched me deeply, but, remembering all things, and thinking of what might come to pass, I could not think of taking her money. "My dear, generous wife-but I really shall not take this money. I shall have it held in trust by your brother for yourself and the children. Then, in case of any monetary misfortune to me, your for- tune will be perfectly secure." My wife looked a little confused--there seemed to her no sufficient reason for such an excess of caution,   86    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. "But you are not in any business where you are tak- ing risks, and you would not be foolish enough to go to speculating with the money, so I do not see why my fortune would not be just as safe with you as with my brother-and I am certain I should like it a great deal better. It is so pleasant to be able to give all this money into your hands, my dear husband-,to show you what complete trust and confidence I have in you, and prove to you how fully and dearlyJ  love you." My wife is not as young as she was once, but I think I never saw her look so beautiful-there was a soft sweet light in her dark eyes, and a lustre on her face that was truly angelic and heavenly. "Your brother will pay you more or less of the in- come, as you decide, every month; and then, every month you can, if you choose, hand it over to mne. That will be even pleasanter than if you gave it to me all in the lump, you know." "Perhaps," she replied. "But think of it, and if you still believe the way you have proposed the best, of course I shall be satisfied. But what a curious man-to refuse money! I always knew you were one man in a thousand-yes, in ten thousand!" and my wife, after flinging her arms around my neck,   DIARY.         87 and kissing me on my cheeks and my lips, left the room. o Thank God that this has happened! Now, what- ever come to pass, Gertrude and the children will be far above want. And whatever the world may think and say of me, it will touch them tenderly, as it al- ways does those upon whom Fortune has smiled. One Scripture the world implicitly follows-would that it observed all the rest as well-"To him that hath, shall be given, and he shall have more abun- dantly; but from him who hath not shall be taken away even the little that he hath." And Gertrude now is rich, and sure of as lenient a verdict, when the truth comes out, as society can frame. And at the worst she has not sinned. Her only sin is in being the wife of a sinner. And she need be that now no longer than she wills it so. She is not bound to me any longer by the stern ne- cessities of life. I shall be dependent upon her rather than she upon me-and she will be able to fol- low without hindrance the sincere impulses of her heart. May not Fortune work a similar change in Ger- trude to that which Fame and Heroism did in Mar- garet? Let me be prepared for anything-but I will   88    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER, not believe it till I experience it. And yet what does Gertrude owe me? What claim have Fickle- ness and Deceit to Constancy? No claim. And yet, if Gertrude fail me, even if she come to know everything, it might almost weaken my faith in God himself. Oh strange and inconsistent heart of man! Faith- less itself, and yet thinking it has a right to expect Faith in return! Fickle, and yet believing in Con- stancy! False, and yet seeing the infinite goodness and perfect beauty of the True! Why should I sup- pose Gertrude to be any wiser or better than I am? Why? I know no other reason than because she is a woman; and, after ten thousand disappointments, Woman must still represent to man all that he can conceive of spotless purity and constant, everlasting love. MONDAY. The last was a glorious week. Noble, spiritual men--ministers and laymen, gathered from all the adjacent region, met here to consider the state of the   DIARY.          89 Church. No mousing 6wls, but the young eagles of Christianity-with eyes and souls open to every new truth--the Apostles of all that is liberal in politics and in religion. I were more than man not to have been proud of my reception when I first arose to address the as- sembly. The deep silence was more expressive than the loudest plaudits would have been. Every eye was turned upon me. Not a word that I said was lost. And I felt from the first that my audience were in the closest spiritual, almost magnetic connection with me. On such occasions is the orator always most himself, most inspired. Half of eloquence, in all cases, is in the ear and heart of the listener. I never spoke with such satisfaction to myself, with such clearness, fluency, and force. My words seemed to come spontaneously, as if I were prompted by some superior power. Perhaps it was so. Every gifted author and every orator is, when at his best, a puzzle and mystery tt himself. For he seems to reach heights above the range of his unassisted powers. In the glory and fervor and excitement of the week I almost forgot my trouble-but now it flows back upon me like a flood. The whisperings and angry   90 -   CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. shakings of --the head, as I marked yesterday, rather increase than diminish. 'Behold how great a fire a little spark kindleth," says the proverb. I fear this little spark is destined to grow into a consuming flame. Shall I yield to it, and allow myself to be con- sumed out of my place, or shall I stamp out the flame with an iron heel? There is no proof against me. Karl has no proof. My letters are all again in my own hand, and they were not very rash at the worst, as I always had a cautious dread of what I said in letters. /A prudent man will beware of what he writes--words are air, and often as evanescent. But the written line!-there it stands for a perpetual witness. X No-Karl has no proof.   Margaret even has no proof. Every thing rests merely on her unsupported word. Put against my solemn denial, what would that amount to? Nothing! The verdict is mine, if I choose to plead Not Guilty. Why should I not plead not guilty? It was an act of folly-which should never have been disclosed- especially by Margaret. As she had no right to dis- close it, am I not justified in'treating it as if it never happened? To Karl and the world it would have  /   DIARY.          9I been as a thing that never happened, save for Mar- garet's foolish babbling. If it affected myself alone the case might be dif- ferent. But it affects my wife and children, my re- latives and friends. It affects my church and con- gregation. More important still, it affects the great cause of liberal Christianity, of which I am the re- cognized head in this portion of the world. Thus, if I admit the truth of the charge, a great blow is inflicted upon hundreds of others, and the cause of truth and righteousness in the earth receives a severe -wound. Would this not far more than overbalance any injury that the cause of morality would receive by a slight deviation from the truth? Thus, as a choice between inevitable evils, is not a denial the least? "Not guilty."  Why, every accused man is at liberty to plead this. It is a right that appertains to his position. The thief who is seen by a dozen in the commission of his act, is expected to plead "not guilty." A sane man is not expected to confess his crime--it must be conclusively proved against him. And in entering the plea of "not guilty," the sin- \ cerest man is not held to utter what is false, but merely to adhere to a necessary technicality. 5   92     CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. What a shock would run through Germany if Dr. Leonhardt, the great Apostle of Liberalism, should admit the truth of so gross a charge! And how the philistines of a purblind orthodoxy,the ignorant zealots of a superstitious faith merely because it was the religion of their fathers, would be strengthened in their false dogmas-and impute to Liberalism the sin of its leading advocate. Have I a right to allow this harm to be done? Have I not a duty to my family, to my church, to the adherents of a great and noble cause, to that cause itself, which far transcends in importance anything that relates merely to my- self? Is it not even an act of base selfishness to con- sider my own personal integrity a matter of such high consideration, that to preserve it from further injury I may ruthlessly sacrifice everything else? Besides, every act must be considered as a whole. The denial of my guilt, even if wrong in one sense, is only a portion of the original sin, no new offence. It is a necessary falsehood, flowing out of the original evil deed. If a man fling himself from a high rock, he may repent when half way, but nevertheless must he go on to the bottom. The offence was in the original leap-all after that is merely a necessary consequence.   DIARY.         93 WEDNESDAY. A month has passed since the forLgoing was writ- ten. How impossible it is, the wolf of slander once unloosed, to chain him againl I think Margaret sees this now, for last evening after prayer-meeting, she pressed my hand, and whispered "Forgive me ! Of course I forgive her-but I cannot respect her as I once did. It was such childish, foolish weakness. I clearly see now that this thing must come to an open issue. My friends, who have perfect faith in me, and are therefore both warm and indiscreet, would force it of themselves. F r though Karl means to be faithful to his promise /to Margaret, he is not patient enough to take blows without giving them in return. Especially as he is in reality inno- cent of any ,offence, save that of leing indiscreet, and considers himself the injured party. One thing I am convinced of.  e will not rest until he ruins my reputation, and dr ves me from my pulpit. If he can. All things t nd to an open rupture before many months. One of the oldest and most vene ble of my con- gregation said yesterday--"Doctor, do you know that Karl von Stein is constantly throwing out inju- rious inuendos against your character-hting about   "    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. wolves in sheeps' clothing, and things of that kind?" 'My dear friend," I replied, "do not trouble yourself with anything of that character which you may hear. I have ever thought it a wise rule to live down all evil speaking against me. It is the course I have frequently recommended in my sermons --and the one I always follow myself." To another old friend, in nswer to a similar re- mark upon another occasion, I said: "The sparks of anger and bitterness go out of themselves, if not fanned by the wind of controversy." To another, on a third occasion: "What says the Master? Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you." To another--"Would you expect /me to elevate any aspersions into importance by noticing them? If my life is not a sufficient answer, what other answer can there be?" To another--"I have too much to do in attend- ing to my Master's business, and in feeding His sheep, to stop to vindicate my character. Dogs bay frequently at the moon, but I never noticed that the moon stopped in its course to vindicate itself. The glory of its light was sufficient vindication." *   ,                     !   DIARY.         95 This last was rather imprudent, I grant-but one cannot keep his perfect patience at all times, and I am getting a little tired. Of course it went the rounds among the congregation as the last good thing of the Minister's, though every one should know it is older than Esop, and doubtless finally will get to Karl's ears, whom it will not help to mollify. MONDAY. Of course. Another letter from Karl-a punish- ment for my folly. I might have known it. DR. LEONHARDT :-I learn that you are adding in- sult to injury, by comparing me, among your circle of deluded partizans, to a dog that bays the moon. I write you this to warn you that Margaret may be led to absolve me from my promise, if you do not put a better guard upon your tongue. When the truth is known, it will be seen who is the dog and who the man, you or I. I refer you to the last chapter of Revelations. There is one verse there about dogs that might furnish you a suitable subject for a sermon. There is also a fable in Esop ,..-   96    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. about a wolf that hid himself in thei skin of a sheep, the better to devour the lambs of the flock, which might furnish you another comparison to make your friends merry with. I give you a second warning to withdraw from the pulpit you disgrace. The third may be more public. -Yours, in earnest,    KARL. The bitter fruit is fast ripening. Ere long I must determine upon my course. Karl will compel me to plead Guilty-or Not Guilty, and in the face of the world. With such a man as Karl, the thunderbolt may come at any moment. I live now with the sword of Damocles hanging constantly above my. head, hang- ing by its single hair. My health is sinking under it, and yet it is a marvel to me how I keep so well as I am. What a splendid thing is a robust frame, through which the blood flows warmly, End every atom of which seems instinct with glowing life. To this I owe my success as much as to any 'native supe- riority of mind. And to this probably I owe my want of self-control. Thus a man's good and evil are indissolubly connected-his triumphs and his failures.  ,1   DIARY.         97 - iOh ye anatomies that fill so many pulpits, how could you ever pardon me, not being able to under- stand the might of the temptation? For me, before man ordained me a minister, God made me a full- blooded man. What right have you to judge me, whose passions are as weak as your frames, and as bloodless as your cheekslahd hearts? Mere frames of bone in bags of skin are not liable to the tempta- tions of the flesh. Pass 'n, if ye ever learn my fault, ye whose veins are filled,-merely with water and with vinegar, for you cannot understand what temptation is, when it comes in the form of a woman, and with the face of an angel of light!? But such a secret as mine must tell at last upon the strongest frame. In the day, I can dismiss it often -from my mind. But, otiosthe long and dreadful night- watches, when I awake from a troubled sleep, and am alone with my sin, and tlh approaching terror! Gertrude seems far from me, though she is sleep- ing the calm sleep of innocence at my side. Then- it is that I say in my heart, oh, that I might die, that I might never wake, nor my eyes open upon another morn! Oh, if it be God's will, how easily, how gladly would I submit to such a solution of the dif- ficulty! And it would be so calm an peaceful a-so- 7   98    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. lution. Gertrude and the children are now provided for. And no one wars with the dead. Even Karl would shed tears over the coffinof his old friend, and remember only his virtues. What a blessed es- cape this would be, what a happy solution of all this menacing trouble. It would seem as if some kind angel must snatch a dart from the hand of tardy Death, to work in this way a blessing to so many, and to the great cause of truth and righteousness in the earth. MONDAY. Would it not then be right, if Death be tardy in coming, to anticipate death? I cannot bear this tor- ture-this slow but sure approach of the struggle in which my all will be at stake. Even at the best is- sue, it must injure me greatly in men's eyes. A minister's chastity is like a woman's, it should not even be suspected.

If not--shall I meet his charges with a stern and unqual- ified denial? I have considered this matter before- but the arguments that would support it, seem to me, upon consideration, empty and sophistical. There can be no higher duty, and no higher good, than for a man, when brought solemnly and sternly to bay, TO TELL THE TRUTH. I have written it; and I shall adhere to it. I over- bear and thrust aside all the cunning sophistry of the intellect, with the clear voice of God in the soul, THou SHAT T NOT LIE! I will not be false to myself, to the Truth, to God. No, let the worst come, rather -than that. If the great cause of Truth and Righteousness in the earth cannot prosper without my uttering a solemn and deliberate LIE, it will have to suffer loss. I shall not attempt to cover my sin with such a Devil's mantle as that.   T00    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER.  MONDAY. In reperusing what I wrote a week ago relative to those anatomies' of -clergymen, those cadaverous bundles of skin and bone, I am conscious that they will answer, '"You see what comes of pampering the flesh. You should have,remembered what Paul says about keeping his body under-and what the practice of holy men has been in all ages of the world. How, by fasting and penances, and even sometimes by self- inflicted scourgings,- they. have kept the body in righteous subjection to the soul." I answer that my philosophy has always been dif- ferent-and even now I do not see reason to doubt its truth. What weakens and injures the body, ne- cessarily weakens and injures the mind and soul, which cannot act on earth at all save through the bodily organs. Just in proportion, therefore, as you weaken its instruments, you weaken the power which the spirit can exert on earth. To save the tongue from the possibility of saying bitter or un- clean things, will you maim it, or pluck it out? Then you also miim it for good as well as for evil. You deprive it of its influence to- save souls, to convert the heathen, to spread an atmosphere of joy and peace around it, to proclaim the goodness and great-   DIARY.         o101 ness of the eternal God. The eye may cast lascivious glances. Is the remedy then to injure its powers- to inflame) it by the use of acrid powders, so that it shall no longer be able to carry the subtler emotions of the soul in its electric gleam? Where would all this lead us? To the destruction of that which is finest and most .beautiful in life, simply because it may be perverted to wrong. And, logically, to the destruction of the whole race of man, because of its continual liability to go astray into forbidden paths. It has been a portion of the liberal Christianity which I have felt it my duty to preach with all my might, to oppose such views of duty as false and mis- chievous. And I see no reason to give up these liberal views now. For my part, I am convinced that my success as a Minister has been owing in a great degree to the natural vigor of my physical powers, in which I resemble our great apostle Luther, and Peter, the chief of the Apostles of the Lord; and I have always striven to keep those physical powers in full health and strength. And if I have sinned now through the power of the flesh, I cannot forget that I have prospered mightily in spreading the truth through the same power. Is there ot great force in what that able *  / I          S   O2    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. English writer, Thomas Carlyle, has said:- -That the main question, is not how much chaff there is in a man, but is there any wheat?} And though I do not mean to contend that what is positively wicked in its character can fairly be compared to mere harmless, if useless, chaff--yet is it not true that, after all, the question is, what is the amount and proportion of the good, the noble, the true in any man-in one word, the amount of pure gold, and not merely the amount of worthless or even mischievous dross? And do you often find virtue, in its noblest and most positive character, without the alloy of some vice, which inheres to it like its very shadow? Is not your Peter apt to be too hasty and impetuous- your John a little too complacent-your Paul too puffed-up-your Calvin a great deal too stern, over- bearing, and given to persecution? And these faults of the men may even be in some cases the dung in which thee flower of their virtue grows. Lest Paul should become too puffed-up in his spiritual pride, through the abundance of the revelations vouchsafed -him, he is given a thorn in the flesh-some error or failing which might tend to his sanctification. The Lord, we read, would taot take it away, even in answer to his repeated prayers; and   DIARY.         0O3 he himself had not the power to pluck it out. His strength could only be perfected in his weakness. Peter vaunts his superiority. "Though all men deny thee, yet will I not deny thee." And the an- swer comes, "Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice." Oh, shameful cowardice of Peter! And yet Peter, perhaps, was the bravest of the Apostles. All the others, except John, who was personally acquainted with the High Priest, had fled. MONDAY. Does Karl-or that meaner brother of his-intend to drive me crazy? I received this morning a marked number of a low newspaper, full of scurrilous hints and allusions-no name given, of course-but with references to a "distinguished clergyman," the ,"thunder-god of one branch of the Church," etc. Oh,God, that I could die! How gladly would I hail the messenger of Death. Every night before I lay my head upon my pillow, I pray that my eyes may not open to the light of another morn. And yet I waken as usual. Will not my merciful Father hear even this prayer?   104    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER Oh, Death, how in my youth I dreaded thy cold, clammy touch. It seemed impossible to me that I could ever reconcile myself to the thought of giving. up this beautiful earth, and being fastened down beneath the close coffin-lid. And then the mourn- ful, horrible burial---ith the heavy earth shovelled in upon you. It all seemed most repulsive, most terrible 1 Now, how changed are all my feelings! Come, Death! thy cold, clammy touch shall seem softer and dearer to me than ever seemed the thrilling warmth of a woman's hand. Oh Earth, mother Earth, I am ready to be taken into thy loving bosom. Hidden there will be all my infirmities, all my weaknesses, and this last great sin. Thou wilt not reproach me, but wilt tenderly hide all my stains in thy soft bosom. I hear thee say, as the wind blows through the long grasses and the vines amid the place of graves, "Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest." How can I live to meet this blow! To see the averted faces of those who have trusted in me-to hear the cold sneers of my enemies, and the ene- mies of the faith I have preached; and, more dreadful than all, the cold moralizing of a world!   DIARY.        105 More, to be an object of pity, where I have been an object of pride! It is too much to ask of any man. Can I fairly be expected quietly to live on, until the approaching doom culminates in my disgrace and shame?    / Oh ye great men of the antique world, ye were not fettered as I am-shall I call it by Superstition, or by Faith? You saw your way clearly, and when the worst came, it always found you prepared. Brutus could not be enchained, the soul of Brutus was always his own, because he always held the sword of Brutus. Was it cowardice that led him to slay him- self when all earthly hope seemed gone?' Brutus was no coward. A drop of cowardly blood could not dwell in his ruddy Roman veins. But, even in defeat and misfortune, he was determined to be vice torious. No conqueror, no adverse Fate should triumph over Brutus-for Brutus was no longer there to be triumphed over. He was with the immortals I! I turn your own arguments against you, ye orthodox who will triumph over my fall. "If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out," you say. "If thy hand offend thee, cut it off." Well, my whole body offends me. Shall I not then, by the same reasoning, be justified in cutting it off from among the living?   1o6    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. Where is self-destruction condemned in the scrip- tures? Find me the chapter, the verses the line. Judas had done a foul deed-and is it not mentioned rather with approval than otherwise, that he went and hanged himself? Was it not the best thing he could do? Have not great leaders, when a decisive battle has gone against them, plunged into the midst of the foe, and died sword in hand?--and have not sober historians, and the common heart of man, com- mended them for so doing? When the last hour of Napoleon had come at fate- ful Waterloo, should' he have left that bloody field alive? Should he not have placed himself at the head of his Old Guard, and died in a last desperate charge for victory? Waterloo should have been his field of triumph, or his grave. He should never have allowed his island enemies to chain him like a second Prometheus to the barren rock of St. Helena. And what a proud feeling it gives to a man, this consciousness of being master of his fate! He is then prepared to laugh at all that his most powerful foes can do against him. There is no malice, no cruelty, no vindictiveness, that he cannot escape-- rising above it to the clouds, if not to the skies.

The] are with the Immortals! MONDAY. I have been reflecting over my last week's argu ments. Oh, that I had a duller eye for a sophism In spite of my wishes, my intellect will ring sharp ant clear. Why has the advancing civilization of the world rejected the code of Cato and Brutus? Has it don so simply of superstition and prejudice, and withou thought.  Had Shakspeare, for instance, that won derful intellect, not considered it? "For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he'himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin?" J      Lo8    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. Mark his answer:- "But that the thought of something after death; That undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveller returns--puzzles the will? And makes us rather bear those ills we have, Than fly to others that we know not of." His answer in brief is this. A truly wise and thoughtful man will not leap in the dark. His state may be bad here, but he will not run the risk of changing it for a worse one. Thus this thought, and the feeling in our conscience that we would not be doing right, "make cowards of us all." I once read a story of a man who, being in the extreme of destitution, and unable to bear the misery of his wife and children, made up his mind to com- mit suicide.  He retired to his room for that pur- pose, but, while waiting for a favorable moment, overcome by weakness and fasting, he fell asleep. Thcn-he dreamed he took up the weapon and used it.  He felt his soul leave his body, and rise to a certain height Above it. He saw his wife come into the room, and the agony of her soul. He saw his children, and their bitter tears, mingled with shame. He felt no power to leave them-he felt no desire to leave them-he was chained to their vicinity by some   DIARY.         Iog09 terrible fascination. Thus he was a witness to all their sufferings, while entirely unable to relieve those sufferings in the least degree. He had simply cut himself loose from the bodily powers which had enabled him to minister in a greater or less degree to their needs-and now could do nothing. He had selfishy craved for himself the peace and repose of the grave; but he had not found them--even his own condition was worse than before. In the midst of this fearful dream he awoke. His wife had come into the room to bring him a letter. She saw the unused weapon, and conjectured his pur- pose. He told her of his dream, and how it had banished all ideas of suicide from his mind. He re- garded it as a divine interposition in his behalf. To crown all, the letter was an offer of remunerative employment. Thus at the eleventh hour, relief had come. What is there unreasonable in such; a story? Is it not even highly probable that thusi instead of im- proving our forlorn condition, we may render it more miserable? Besides, how often succor comes at the eleventh hour, after what may have been simply a trial of our faith and- patience. Thus when our Great Frederick   IIO    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. seemed irretrievably ruined--when France and Aus- tria and Russia ad -Poland, and even Sweden, were combined against our poor little Prussia, and Berlin was in the hands of the enemy--when his favorite s brother and his ablest generals had perished in battle -who can wonder that with his antique spirit, our hero-king should have contemplated self-destruction? Ah, that every man in such a cnjunction of all his evil stars, had a friend like d'Argens to save him from despair, and to rouse him anew to still more vigorous and finally triumphant efforts! I am willing to pattern after such noble men as Cato and Brutus. But the question is, what would Cato and -Brutus do if they were living now? And if I know them aright, they would, under Christian influences, act like Christians. I suppose I am here soniewhat as a soldier on duty. Certainly I have had a work to do, unless all my life hitherto has been a great mistake. Then what right have I to forsake my post until relieved by my com- mander? A Russian serf might teach me better- for such, turned into soldiers, have been known to perish in their place simply because they were forgot- ten, and they would not go until relieved.

What welcome is he liable to, who enters any higher sphere uninvited? We need not fear being neglected, when our turn comes. Death never forgets any one. But the burden of the shame? Ah, I feel it press- ing down towards me, like a floating mountain of wrath. Oh that the Merciful Father would arrest its course, even by my sudden death. But I have con- sidered the matter fully, and I cannot, like Brutus, take the sword of the Death-angel into my own hand. I must abide the shock-like-I say it rever- ently-like Christ! Perhaps it is a part of my predestined Expiation. A Thought said to me, like an Angel, in the middle of the night--"Wouldst thou not rather be punished before men, than wait for the judgment-seat of God, and there be rebuked in His presence, and that of   II2    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. the holy Angels?"And then I thought of All, the friend of Mohammed, "the bright sword of the Faithful." Finding his last hour approaching, Ali was carried to the Mosque, and there addressed the people. "Do I owe any man anything?" said Ali, expecting an answer in the negative. "Yes," said a harsh voice, " thou owest me five silver pieces."  "Pay him then at once," said Ali to his purse-bearer; "better be ashamed now than at the Day of Judgment." And so I say with Ali, "better be ashamed now than at the Day of Judgment!"  But, oh, that this cup might pass from my lips! It is a bitterer one even than that drank by the Divine Master, for this has the flavor of sin. But oh, that I may have the strength given me to drink it, if it be the will of God that it should be placed to my lips. And may I find in it Expiation, and forgiveness from God, even if only calumny and reproach from men. MONDAY. Now that I have determined upon my course, I 'find at times a sweet calm settle upon my soul. The   DIARY.         I I3 more I think of it, the more I am convinced that I am in the path of Duty. I shall not, make a step forward to welcome shame-and I shall not make -any needless disclosures-but when I see the tempest is- upon me, I shall simply resign my ministerial position, and preach my last sermon. I think that even Karl will be satisfied when he sees me thus humbled. FRDAY. I have just had a visit from Rudolph. He is in great trouble. About two weeks ago, his wife took their three children-a boy and two girls-and went on a visit to her brother, who is a wealthy manufac- turer in Dresden. Charlotte, fiudolph's wife, is in appearance a frail creature, but, as it often happens in such cases, full of :spirit-a kind of compound of air and fire., Totally unfitted, one would think, for Rudolph, but pleasing him, I suppose, through the very attraction of opposites. Yesterday he received the following letter:- 8   "4    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. RUDOLPH VON ARNHEIM: -When I left the shelter of your roof two weeks ago, I went with a purpose. It was to consult my brother as to what became his sister, and our father's daughter, to do in a case like mine. He has advised me, and that advice is in accordance with the dictates- of my own heart. Henceforth you and I must be strangers. At the altar of the Lord you pledged me to be faithful until death. Have you been faithful? It sounds like a jest to ask such a question. And what I have borne-patiently and quietly borne-God only knows. You may say that I have made no complaint. Am I a woman to complain? and of such a thing as that? Complain that you prefer the society of other women to mine! I would die first. Yes, I have borne and forgiven much. But my cup of bitterness at last has run over. This last scandal-this open, public scandal-at which you ought to hang your head in shame, but do not--is j the added drop too much. Rudolph, you are no longer my husband-you have forfeited every claim to be considered such. Am I, of all women in the world, the one to be the mistress of a harem? How dare you put such a slight upon me--me, in whose veins runs the best   DIARY.         15 blood of Germany! I scorn myself that I have borne with your insults so long and so patiently. I have taken our children. You will not want them., You have at least too much manliness to wish to bring up your sweet innocent girls in an atmosphere of pollution and shame. And as to our noble boy, you will not wish to take him from me to form himself on your model, and follow after you into the depths of licentiousness and crime. Self- indulgent and guilty as you are, I give you credit for that muchtmanliness and true love for our children. Oh, how I loved you, Rudolph! You know I would have died for your sake. Do you remember the sweet days of our courtship, when you vowed again and again that I was the only woman you had ever loved, or could love? And how have you proved the truth of those vows? By a continual breaking of your marriage pledge, and worshipping at other shrines than mine. Heaven knows I am not a jealous woman-you, yourself must acknowledge that-but I am a woman, and therefore such things are as the pangs of death. Rudolph, I also vowed to be faithful to you. And I have been faithful, both in heart and deed. But supposing I had not been. Suppose I had been as   I 6,   CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. faithless as you. Would you be satisfied with me? Would you make light of it-and say it was of no great consequence? If you would, I should despise you even more than I do now. This is my first protest in words--and it is my last. Oh shame to me, that I should be forced to write such a letter-and utter that which a pure-minded woman is wronged in being compelled even to think! With all your faults and weaknesses and wicked- nesses, I know you to be at the core, Rudolph, once my husband, a man of honor. Else I never could have loved you. I know you must be that in your inmost heart, for a mere selfish, cruel libertine I never could have loved. My nature would have shrunk from yours as from the cold coils of a venomous serpent. Being such, you will acquiesce in this decision of mine, like the noble man that you are in part, and which I once thought you were entirely. You cannot alter-I am not foolish enough to sup- pose that you can alter, or will even make an effort to alter, your nature--and therefore nothing remains for us but this separation. You may provide in future for the children, if you so desire. If you do not, my brother is both able and willing to do so. Of course for myself I neither   DIARY.         17 ask nor would receive anything from you-no longer being your wife, except in name. And if you desire that even thilslight bond should be legally severed, I am willing to aid you to the extent of my power. In fact, I think it would be better-for then you will be able to marry another; which would be best for you. Only, when making a second choice, do choose some one of a less exacting character than I am. And now, Rudolph-oh, my husband, sweet love of my youth, God pity me that I should be thus compelled to say it!--Farewell, and forever! CHARLOTTE. As Rudolph read this letter aloud to me, he was so much affected that he had frequently to pause and gather calmness to proceed. I had never given him credit for such great depth of feeling-nor thought that he cared much for Charlotte one way or the other. But there was no mistaking the depth and sincerity of his present emotion. "Well," said I, " will you acquiesce in Charlotte's course?" "I never thought it would come to this--I never thought that she cared much about it," he replied, almost with sobs.    I 18   CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. "But it seems she does care," I continued; "and I for one do not blame her for leaving you." "Of course not," he answered, "of course not! She has a perfect right to do so. But I cannot con- sent to it-I cannot lose her. She is the only woman I ever truly loved. And my children! I must have them back. And yet what she says is just. But I must have them all back. Dear Doctor, I want you to write to her-you would have more influence with her than anybody else." "My influence will amount to nothing in such a -case as this. Your wife is like a blade of polished steel, she is not a lump of dough. Why did you not marry a lump of dough, instead of such a high-spirited creature--so finely compounded of earth and air and fire? Then you would have had no trouble." 'CBut write to her-promise me you will write, and see what you can do." "What shall I say?" "Say anything--promise everything. It shall all be as she wishes, if she will only return." I looked at him sternly, and spoke severely--' I will not be one at a fool's bargain, Rudolph von Arnheim. Neither suppose that you can deceive the keen eyes of such a woman as your wife." 1  }   DIARY.         II9 "I mean to make no false bargain. I mean to do what I say, and be true hereafter to Charlotte. I would rather have her than all the other women in the world without her. I know she will trust me, if I promise." "If this is your meaning, then I will write--and if Charlotte can only be assured that you are really in earnest, I think it probable she will return. But you are undertaking a great work, Rudolph, my friend-a greater than the greatest of your business enterprises. tThe man who can rule his own spirit is greater than he who taketh a city.}' "I know it," said Rudolph, apparently much re- lieved; " butif I have strong- passions, I also have an iron will; and, please God, for Charlotte's and the children's sake, I will live hereafter a new life." 'I am glad to hear you say so," and I took his massive hand and shook it warmly. "I know you can rule yourself, if you firmly determine upon it, for you are a man of iron. But remember, when you find that iron strength of yours failing, as it cer- tainly often will, that in the infinite spaces above us, there are immense stores of mental and spiritual power, which will flow into and reinforce the waning strength of the soul, in answer to all fervent prayer   120    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. and supplication. Therefore, ask and you shall re- ceive, my friend; for He knoweth our frame, He rernembereth that we are dust." "And so Rudolph departed, greatly comforted. I feel certain that all will come out right-that Char- v lotte only needs the assurance of a change of life on his part, to return ho him gladly. And what is-the moral of this little drama? That women of the fine, high nature of Charlotte, cannot be held on such unequal terms as Rudolph offered. They feel their own worth, and demand heart for heart. They are both the product and the reward of the monogamous marriage, of the union of one man with-one woman. And by the very fineness of their natures, they are pledged not to submit to any other. FRIDAY. It cannot much longer be evaded. One of the elders of the church thinks Karl should be called to account for calumny and evil-speaking. IX found it difficult to restrain him-he says a large portion of the congregation unite with him, that Karl has gone too far to be tolerated any longer, that I may have   !jt   DIARY.         1 2IA the forbearance and patience of a saint, but they have not. I implored him, and, at last, commanded him, as he valued my love, and my peace, to let the thing go no further. He left me, not knowing what to think. I He would not, I am sure, admit it to him- self, much less to any one else, but I know there is just the faintest touch of suspicion in his heart that Karl's words are not entirely without warrant. FRIDAY. A week has passed. It has been an earnest, a ter- ribly earnest week to me. I have spent a large por- , tion of my tirfe in prayer. Sitting with my family or in my stud, walking the streets, sleeping in my bed, my lips parted no ,but my heart was a continual prayer--"What is the best 'for me to do, oh Father? Suffer me not now to make a false step. Give me wisdom to' know the riglt, and strength to do it!" *  ;     WEDNESDAY. The hour is at hand;- Karl has heard that pro- ceedings have been contemplated against him, and *, '    I22    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. thinks that I am really the instigator of them, and that all my opposition is merely feigned. As a con- / sequence, he is angry, and talks with less of a curb up n his tongue than ever. Margaret, also, looking at the matter from Karl's point of view, is beginning to take side with him. THURSDAY. To-day I shall send in my resignation of my pas- toral office, to take effect on Monday; and on Sun- day I shall preach my last sermon. I tremble to think of the excitement and spiritual turmoil that it will occasion. I shall decline, however, to see any one between now and Sunday morning. After my sermon is preached, very few probably will wish to see me. SATURDAY NIGHT. I have not written any sermon. I fear it would be too cold-besides, I trust that the Lord will put more suitable words into my mouth than any I could my-   DIARY.  '       23 self frame. Still, I shall not expect a miracle worked in my behalf, simply to save me the labor of think- ing. I do not suppose the Lord will help a man to do that which He has already given him the mental and spiritual power to do. But there is an added glow and an -added insight as of inspiration, which I have sometimes been conscious of-occasions on which I have surpassed and surprised myself; at which moments I have never been certain that some higher power was not speaking through my lips. SUNDAY NIGHr. It is over-thank God! And thank God for His mercy and His goodness!  His spirit must have been present, and overruled all. The cup of bitterness when I pressed it to my lips had a flavor as of milk, and when I drained the last dregs of the draught they tasted like honey. Oh praise the Lord for His goodness, and his wonderful works to the children of men. He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and the dry ground into water-springs. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever!   Gertrude, my wife,--she is not a mere woman-- she is an angel ot the Lord-and I knew it not. Karl is not my enemy, he was merely the minister of God's justice, who bore not the sword in vain. Margaret is a pearl indeed-whom the Lord will not reject for its single flaw, when He comes to make up His jewels. It is all right. I feel that my Expiation is com- plete, and my forgiveness as complete as my expia- tion. My offence is blotted out of the Lamb's book of Life. The avenging angels have no longer any power over me. I have triumphed over Death, Hell, and the Grave. I have received the white stone, on which is the new name that no man knoweth, and which is the talisman of the ransomed and the re- deemed. Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates, that the King of Glory, and His saints, may enter in ! MONDAY NIGHT. I  could not write more at length, or enter into any particulars last night--my heart was too full of emotion and of unutterable joy.  The oppressive weight of the last year is at length removed. Those l   DIARY.         125 that I care for most will still look kindly upon me. And if I am no longer their Pastor, I shall still be their friend. I will endeavor to sketch my sermon-or as much as I can remember of it. But I know, though no on has told me, that I never preached with such power. I need not that any one should tell me. I felt as if the eternal voice was with me. And I saw in the faces of my listeners, in their moist eyes, their rapt attention, that I was speaking to their inmost souls. The church was crowded, even to the aisles and the pulpit steps. My text, or rather my texts, were as follows:- "And Nathan said unto David: Thou art the Man!" "I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will." As I read these texts, I happened to glance at Karl, who sat directly before me. He smiled a bitter smile. Margaret sat by his side-a beautiful glow on her cheeks, and with her eyes cast down. I commenced by enlarging upon the subject of Marriage, as we found it an existing institution among us. That a thing exists as it does, I argued,   I26    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. was prima facie evidence of its right so to be. As to marriage, as we have it, the union for life of one woman with one man, it must be considered the result of infinite thought and a very long experience upon one of the most interesting and important sub- jects that could engage the human mind. Starting in savagery with no law but caprice, and progressing through concubinage and polygamy, the race, or rather the leiding nations of the race--the wisest and the best-have finally arrived at the monogamous marriage, the union- for life of one woman with one man. That such is the position of the wisest nations, after the diverse experiences of manyithousand years, is a very strong argument in favor of the excellence of the present system. I also looked at the subject in another but kindred light. I argued that all the highest and purest in- stincts of Love, when at its very highest and best in the finest souls, crave such a marriage-will not hear of any other. And that which is craved by the highest instincts, in the highest moments of life, must be the best in itself, even though human nature may not always be equal to it. Then I spoke of the evident object of life-the improvement of the individual and of the race. WH.    -      DIARY.         127 That this improvement and advancement is mainly to be carried on by the wise nurture and education of the children; and I arued that the present system of Marriage is the best, because it is the best adapted to secure this suitable nurture and education. This is one reason why the monogamous nations advance, and why the polygamous retrograde, or, at the best, stand still. Then I deviated to the kindred subject of faithful- ness. The superior purity of the mother, I urged, was not only in accordance with the higher senti- ments, but with the reason of things. If the husband is expected to work and plod for his children, he must feel a perfect assurance that they are his children. Of course the wife always knows that her children are her own, but the husband's knowledge must rest upon his perfect confidence in his wife's faithfulness. For this reason it is, in addition to the demand of the natural sentiments, that society exacts faithfulness in women with greater sternness than in men-because it is the very corner-stone of the Family, without which it could not exist. Women, I continued, are not unfairly treated in this, because it is the one virtue demanded of them. They are not required, as men are, to be courageous,   I28    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. and, as I sometimes think, scarcely even to be truth- ful. They may even pride themselves a little upon being cowards, which would ruin the character of a man--and when they say what is untrue, they are even too easily forgiven. Everything is pardoned to Woman but a want of Chastity. There, Society is inexorable; because the chastity of its women 'is necessary to its own preservation. Such in brief, I said, were the reasons for marriage, and for faithfulness in marriage. There was the ad- ditional reason that Faithfulness was always pledged. Both parties mutually covenanted with each other to be faithful and true.  "ove was a noble sentiment--but, like all our other sentiments and passions, it needed to be properly governed and controlled. The great man is he who can rule himself-who is master of his cravings and desires, ' Our literature, even our higher literature, too often fails through paying undue homage to Love-by representing its sway as being rightly and properly unbounded. High literature should repre- sent the hero denying himself even Love, in obedi- ence to Duty. How mean and little, I continued, is that man who yields himself up as a slave to the dominion of a:-y   DIARY.         129 of the passions-so that he who should rule them is governed by them. See Antony, in his last great battle, like a love-sick school-boy, following Cleopatra out of the turmoil of the fight, and becoming the jeer and derision of all after ages. How often is the example of Antony imitated-until even the woman herself is ashamed of the weakness that she has en- snared. Shakspeare's portraiture of Cleopatra's love is a false one-she, with' all her faults, was of too regal a nature really to love such an enamored fool as Antony. The high commanding character of a Caesar or an Augustus, that knew his place and hers, was doubtless far more to her fancy. Then I paused, and, after a few moments of solemn unexpected silence, entered more directly into the subject of my discourse. "And Nathan said unto David, 'Thou art the Man!'"   And I say unto many a man and woman in this house, THOU ART THE MAN! My eyes roved around the congregation. I felt a power which enabled me to look into their inmost souls. I noted, as by instinct, the innocent looks turned wonderingly upon me, and the stolen and half defiant glances of conscious guilt. I passed rapidly over the sin of David--it was apparent to all It. was adultery, and murder to 9   130   CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. conceal adultery. How then could he be "a man after God's own heart"?--that was the question which it was important to answer. I should at- tempt it. This great sin was not all of David. The records show that he was also a man of wonderful generosity and nobleness, as well as of marvellous piety. It was his general character that was spoken of. What nobility was shown in his repeated sparing of Saul! What wonderful nobility and piety in his refusing to drink of the cup of water obtained at the risk of life! It was too costly and precious for him to drink of, and he poured it on the ground as a libation to the Lord. But there was another, and perhaps a better reason. When the Prophet said, Thou hast judged thyself, -and thou art the man, David did not begin a course of extenuations and excuses. He simply said, "I have sinned against the Lord!" He acknowledged at once his great crime. Look into your own hearts, if you would 'know how difficult it is to do this. How many in this large assembly would be able to imitate the example of David? Is there one? If there be, let him rise to his feet now, and say so.   DIARY.         X 31 Many took a deep breath--and there was a painful silence-but no man moved. It is even so, I continued; there is not one man Tpresent who is willing and able to imitate the example of David--though doubtless there are many who have greatly sinned. If they have sinned in a less degree, it should be all the easier to acknowledge it. But it is hard to stand up in the sight of all, and say, I have sinned against 'God; I have wronged my neighbor in this thing and in that. David did it, and therefore. it was that he was a man after God's own heart. My brethren, I continued, this is the last sermon I ever expect to preach in this or any church. You have wondered at the announcement, and questioned why it is so. I will give you my answer in the words of David-"I have sinned against the Lord." The room was very close, partly owing to the crowded state of the church. There was a disturb- ance-a woman had fainted, and was being taken to an open window. It vUas Margaret.    t Such events generally add to the excitement and the feeling. It was so in this case. I stood quietly in the pulpit until silence was fully restored. Then I continued.   13-2   CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. Yes, my brethren, I stand now before you, and admit my sin. It is my cross, and shall I not bear it---even into the deep valley of shame? I confess that I am. no longer worthy to fill this pulpit-can no longer fill it with a clear conscience. For I re- member the words of the Apostle--"Thou that sayest another man should not steal, dost thou steal? Thou that sayest another should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery?" A shudder, almost a groan, ran through the con- gregation. I had been so loved, almost so worshipped by them. Even those who were not without sin themselves, lamented and wailed in their souls over me.. For I was as a god to them. For me to fall was like the falling of the sun from the heavens. I interpreted their sorrow, and it pierced me to the heart. Brethren, I continued, I hope there is not a man present who does not feel in his heart how much easier it would be for me to die than say what I am 'now saying. Fervently have I prayed for death, night after night, for many months. But Death was not to be my punishment. This was to be my pun- ishment-and I call upon all that are here, to bear witness for me, in this world and at the Last Day,   DIARY.         I 33 that I have stood up before you, and drunk my cup of Repentance and Shame and Humiliation to the very dregs! And now, I added, I have but one word more to say. I have felt it my duty to do this in Expiation of my sin. I have thought it would be accepted as an Expiation by the man I have wronged, by this congregation which I have- humiliated, and by the Lord whom I have betrayed. A deep voice rose up from among the crowded congregation-it was so charged with emotion that few if any seemed to Tecognize it, but I knew it was the voice of Karl, simply saying: "It is accepted!" Then my old friend and neighbor, Paulus, rose. His face was convulsed with emotion beneath the white crown of his silver hair. Paulus of the blame- less life. He essayed to speak, but at first his voice failed him. Then he gathered up his strength and, said :- "And in the name of this congregation, I make bold to say to my erring and much-loved brother- loved. now by me more than ever before-that he is forgiven, and his Expiation is accepted I Say I not right, my brethren?" A storm of "Amens" resounded through the   I 134   CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. vaulted building. It was as the unanimous voice of my congregation. My Expiation, so far as men were concerned, was accepted. Then I appealed to the Eternal Father in prayer. I pleaded that men had forgiven me, and implored His forgiveness. I cannot remember what I said. I only know that I wrestled as Jacob did, when he would not let the angel go until he had given him his blessing. Am; I ashamed to acknowledge that the tears streamed down my cheeks?  I knew it not until I saw tears of a whole congregation answering mine.-i    , Then-;I say not that it was miraculous--but, as I closed my prayer, and through the window which had 'bee Opened to give fresh air to Margaret, a white ve entered, flew around the building three times, aid then departed as it came! I accepted it, all accepted it, as an answer from Heaven. My Ex- piation I complete!  My Sin was forgiven! I tottere'd down from the pulpit, groped my way into the little room adjoining, and sank into a chair. Then the door was flung open, and a woman sprang in.  She threw her arms around my neck and kissed me. I knew it was Gertrude, my wife-most faithful  ^-    DIARY.         135 and forgiving of women! She said in a low, sweet tone: "Let it now all pass, my husband. Thou hast suffered too greatly already. Let us go homne- that I and thy children may comfort thee, and prove how much we love thee." But, ere we went, Paulus came up and fell upon my neck, and kissed me. And Karl shook me warmly by the hand. And many others also came up and blessed me. So that, as I said, my cup of Expiation tasted like milk, and even its dregs were like honey. MONDAY. Another week has passed, and I have had time to collect my thoughts. I have been offered, gr-eatly to my surprise, a position in the University as one of the Professors. But, although all are very kind and respectful to me, I feel that I should like to leave Berlin--at least for a time. My wife is also anxious to go, and cut loose from all the old thoughts and scenes, t   136    CONFESSIONS OF A MNISTER. - WEDNESDAY. It is decided. In one week's time we shall leave Berlin -soon to set sail for the new world. In an entirely fresh scene I shall be able to break utterly with the Past, and begin, as it were, a new career. Oh America, how many worn and weary hearts hast thou received, and nursed into fresh life and vigor upon thy generous bosom! THE END.
