Y.  a DBekman St.   TO MY FRIEND, "OUIS GAYORD CLARK, EDITOR OF THE KNICKERBOCKER MAGAZINE, Who is among the first to discover, appreciate and applaud Genuine Humor, This Volume is Respectfully Dedicated, by THE AUTHOR. " PREFACE.  The old excuse, the " earnest solicitation of friends" to have the LECTURES OF PROFESSOR HANNIBAL preserved in permanent form for future laughter, might be plead in extenuation for daring to inflict them upon the public in book form. But the author does not wish to avail himself of such excuse, and at once frankly confesses that the reason for thus collating them was, that he might sell them, and that the proceeds might be devoted to the novel purpose of supporting his family. The Lectures may be found very unequal in point of merit (if they have any), but let it be remembered that they were written upon a bed of pain, when the brain was slow to work, and the muscles had struck all together. When the simplest movement was intense agony; when night brought with it no sleep, and the reme- dies of the physician insignificant relief. In all of the Lectures, however, the author has attempted hits at the prevailing follies of the time, and to draw a moral therefrom; and if some of the itinerant lecturers of the day should find themselves satirized, none will stop to weep.- "A little nonsense now and then, Is relished by the wisest men." - If this be true, he may hope to brush away the cobwebs of care from the brow of the most learned, and carry smiles into the homes of all classes. If they are found to lighten the heart of the burden of life, and drive dull care from the weary, it is all that can be expected by THE AUTHOR.   r 6 nut rt .i* "ECTURB                      PAQB I.

LECTURE I. FELLER SITIZANS:                         - I HAB come, as you all know, from   'way down in Ole Warginna, whar I studded edicashun and siance all for mysef, to gib a corse of lectures on siance gine-  ," i raly, an events promiscuously, as dey from time to time occur. De lettter ob invite I receibed from de komitee from    4 dis unlitened city, was as full ob flattery as a gemman ob my great desernment, edication, definement, and research' could wish.                           ! I 'greed to deliber my fust discourse dis ebening, but de fattig ob trablin in de kars hab jolted all de ideas out ob me, notwistandin' de kornductors was bery sibil to me, an , rity perlite to Sister Bartolemew, who trabeled under my     : 'tection all de way. Dey gib us fuss rate kar, an on de o teamboat dey gib us fuss rate bed-sep'rate, ob korse. What you all snikerin 'bout?-don't you noe dat to laff- rite out in meetin am wulgar? but I spose you don't noe     : no better. It am all owin to de brougtens up of de chile. You got nobody dat noes notin to tell you notin. You will find de words o' my text in de lass clays ob de ninety-furst chapter of de Pilgrim's Progress, whar it says-  Simon said unto Peter, Let not dy conscience be made ob injin rubber, lest It atruch dy sole into dat lake which burns wid fier an' brimstone, kian pepper an' - assefedity.   "        BLACK DIAMONDS. You must not spose, in de fust place, dat de Simon an' Peter 'luded to in de text was de Simon an' Peter wat libed in de time when Jerusa-lam was a little willage, an' when de possle Noah wore swadAlin clothes, kase it wasn't he at all. It was Simon Smock talkin' to he son Peter, when he lebe he fadder's manshun, in Tater-pelin alley, one mornin' on a carryin' in wood speckilation. Now Pete was a bad feller, an' would lie, and take tings 'casionally wich didn't 'long to him, an' de same 'wich may 'ply to you all, derefor I warn you get de tex by hart. Dere am a grate many men in dis comunity dat hab injin rubber consciences, an' de most prominent ob de class am considered .de lawyer-next de showman, and den de doc- torman. De lawyer's conscience will 'low him to struch it furder dan de rest, an' some ob dem hab nearly broke it in too by continual stretchin. One ob dese days, snap it will go, and den good Mr. Lawyerman, 'way he go to de lake dat burn wid all dem 'grediances 'splained in de text. Dis lake, my fritened hearers, must be a mighty big one to hold all de lawyers, if nobody else in de world but lawyers go dere, kase dere am seberal lawyers to ebery inhabitant troughout de State. Whar dis lake am sitewated am a, puzzler to me, an' all succeeding stronimers .dat hab libed afore my time. But I find, by what I can glean, arter burrfin' seberal quantities of midnight oil in deep and labo- rus resarch, dat it must be nie de gulf whar de walcanoes mountanes am, else whar de debel do de walcanoes get up sich a fire from? Why, de cat-a-kize sez dat de 'rumptions ob Mount Wociferous can be heard fur seberal days, fur several miles off, previus before de fire fly, an' previously arterwards. Now, do you wish to noe, you poor trembling sinners, wat noise dat am dats heard 'seeding from de mount? Well, I'll tell yer. It am de grones, de lamonta-   INTRODUCTION.         15 shuns, and de smashing ob teeth ob de wicked peoples who hab let their consciences struch like injin rubber. Dis lake, my friends, am sebrel hundred miles in sarcum- ference, an' 'bout half dat distance round de edges. It am a hundred miles perpendicularly measured, an' no bottom hab been found to it yet, dat we nose on. De Rochester knockin' spirits didn't come from dis place, else we find out all 'bout it. Dere was some wicked sailors got so nie to-de top of de mountain where de 'ruption comes from once, dat next day dey found demseffs broke out wid a'ruption all ober dere bodies, which de dockter struched him conscience 'fishently to pronounce de measels, and he condemd the whole proceedings as bein' rash. Dis drefull place am for bad colored man, as well as bad wite manm an' no matter how much you 'spize de moon-truck tribe on dis eart, you got to mix up wid dem in dat warm climate, an' no doubt many in dis extremely southern climate will be found to hab northern principles. An' ole Simon noein dis fact, he spake out to de boy Pete to warn him from de greezy -road ob sin, and pint him out de rite paff to kingdom cum. An' now, let me tell you dat a man who possesses an injin rubber conscience, and libs ohly to skin him brudder out ob him eye teeth, can neber be happy in dis world, nor in enny oder country; his sinful follies will fall on him own head, like a siege hammer on a carpet tack, and sooner or later he i get smashed, like rotten egg in egg nog time. De more you tuist and turn dis fac, de bigger it git, gis like snow-ball. While Brudder 'Rastus Putts passes roundde hat, de congregashun will please' sing de useal-Ducksholiday to de same good ole tune.   BLACK DIAMONDS. LECTURE II. NEW YEAR'S NIGHT DISTURBANCE. MY B'LUBBED LAMS: I is almoss 'shamed ob myseff for 'pearin"'afore you in de shape ob de 'pology; but I better 'pear in dat shape dan in the-shape of Satin. De fack am, I am so corn- founded and cornfused sens New Year's day, dat I don't noe wedder my hed am a bee hive or a saw mill, for I hear one minnet de bees in one ear, an' de nex I hear a saw mill in de odder, an' I ain't been able to git up a ginewine lectur dis time. I'll tell you how all dis happen. I made frequent calls on New Year's day, as moss of ob you noe, an' I was berry 'tickler not to 'tempt to karry more den my strength would 'low, kase I seed at ebbery corner men wid bildin' terials in dere hat, so I keep my top eye open. Well, in de ebenin' I met de kummitty dat presented me wid my new year's, at Anty Clawson's seller, as 'prebeously before 'greed 'pon, and dey gub me de trowsers an' seckon'-han' boots, an' de ober-cote an' Hungagarian's hat, as I 'luded to you lass week, an' arter de sechefyin' we had -a little colission ob clam soup an' hot stuff. Well, de hot stuff was berry nice an' sweet, an' I foun' out arterwards mitey strong, an' by de time I drink a pint, my hed snap an' crack like a country tavern's swingin' sine in a nor'-easter, an' den I felt in a per- fee state ob happiness. Arter a little I rose to go hum to my wartus bed, but Brudder Libberlip an' Anty Clawson seduced me to stay all nite, kase you all noe it war a berry   bad nite for peeple ob my age to be out. Well, I went to bed dar, an' got asleep, but it didn't lass long, for de fust ting I node I hear a feller singin' to Mary dat lib up stares I speck, dat he war a settin' on the style whar dey set side by side. By golly, tinks I, you got a cold burth ef you set dar long, an' it wasn't a minnet afore de same feller assured me dat he wouldn't go hum till mornin'-till daylite did ap- pear. Well den, sez I, stay out; who de doose cars? oney don't bodder me. Agin I dosed, when sum young bloods come to de winder, and brag'd 'bout dere bettin dere money on a bobtail nag, an' dat sum body bet on de gray. I node it wasn't me dat bet on de gray, kase I nebber hab money 'nuff to bet, an' I dont noe nofin 'bout hoss racin' an' I was gwane to git up to tell dem so, when I hear a woice cross de treet 'nounce, inf a loud key, dat Ole Dan Tucker had come to town, an 'was a walkin' de treets 'round. :Well dat make me mad, to tink a pusson muss be woke up in de nite time to be told dat Dan Tucker cum to town, when we'd all seen it in de Herald in de mornin', if Daniel was worth noticin'. I was gis gwyne- to trow my boot at him, wwhen some kuller'd man near 'by kummenced beggin' people to carry him along. He wanted to be carried " down to de. berryin' groun'," an' tole he massa not to cry. Dat made me feel bad, till I hear de same feller tell his Susanna dat he cum all de way from Alabama wid a banjo on his nee, an' beg her not to cry for him. I was wrothy den. I felt boun' to get up an' lam dat chap; but my 2tention was 'rested by a chap rite by de winder, tellin' me in a cornfedenshul tone dat Nelly was a lady, but dat she died the night afore, an' he wanted all de bells toled for he dark Wargina bride, an' he had just poured his sorrow in my ear when a pate- rotic young Dutchman, 'bout two houses off, 'formed de sleepin' world dat de star spangled bang-danger did wabe    18         BLACK DIAMONDS. ober de hum of the grabe. Well, den, I tink ebbery body must go mad, an' I turned ober to try go to sleep, when a party ob 'bout a duzen cum rite in front ob de dore, an' sung out togedder, "Wake up, Mose, de fire am burnin' roun' de corner; de ingine comin." Oh, tinks I, dey hab mistook de house; so I got up an' opened de dore, an' stuck my hed up, an' tole dem to go long wid dere noise, dat Mose didn't lib dar, an' dat it muss be in the nex treet. Well, wood you b'lebe it, as soon as dey see me, one feller holler'd, "Hillo! here's ole Julius Ceaser Hannabel. Let's crown him King of de Darkeys," an' dey went to to the curb stone an picked up a barrel dat was a sittinr dar haff full ob ashes, an' put it rite ober my head. I holler'd "Murder " an' "' Fire," but my hed bein in the barrel, nobody hear me but Anty Clawson, who got up an' exagerated me from my pe- rulus :iterwashun, ob bein smudder'd in de ashes. When I cum'd out I felt bad; my eyes, nose, an' mouf was full, an' when I blow'd em out, an' dey got so I cood see, dere stood Anty Clawson in her nite gown, an' dere was I widt oney my linin to cubber me. I felt mity streeked an' dusty, but I shook off de moss ob it, an' went to bed. When I fust looked out ob de cellar, to tell the lofers to go 'way, I seed a poleeceman on de corner, but as soon as he seed a row he - Iulked down a airy till it was all ober. Well, den I git a little nap, an' when I wake up I found I hadn't sleep'd none all nite, an' my hed felt as big as a new recruit on his fuss parade day; an' I aint got clar ober it yet. Some ob my 'ponents want to try to 'sinewate dat I was drunk; but de fuss brudder or sister dat 'siniwate dat fack will get red out ob de meetin'. I do b'lebe dere was eder rum or camfene in dat hot stuff, or sumfin else dat make your hed feel as if it was a hangin' by de hair unconnected wid de shoulders altogedder.   WOOLLY.           19 De moral of my discord to-nite will be found in de lass claws. Don't drink much hot stuff, ef it be eber so sweet. I hope my 'pology am 'scepted, an' nex week I'll perpe- trate somefin' dat'll be a libin' monument to de siantifick institute. De collecshun dis ebenin' will be for cole an' lites, and for to bye your poorly surported lecturer anudder shurt, kase de nasty ashes spile de only one I had. Brudder Gustus Arlington Snubs will please pass roun' de sasser, an' be careful to gib back no change. / e LECTURE   III. WOOLLY.  MY STEEM'D FREN'S:  HABIN' sumwat 'cubberd from de 'fecks ob dat hot stuff dat dc kommitte made for me at Anty Clawson's on New Year's nite, and also likewise from de 'fecks ob de ash barrel dat de rowdies put on my hed, I begin my lecturs oa- 4 . , siantific subjecks, an' de fuss ting I shall call your 'tention  am to de beaufull cretur none as              - DE'SHEEP. De lubly anamile spoken ob in de tex am konsidered won ob de moss inosent an' abused fellers seen in de spellin' book. He am a full bluded wully hed, an' allers sticks to he party. In fack, you seldom see dem separated de one from de odder, for de poet sez dat---  j ..,   20         BLACK DIAMONDS. "Sheeps ob a wool All flock to one skool." An' dat's a fack, for I nebber seed eny class ob de kommu- nity stick togedder so klose as dese fellers, not eben de Quackers or de Jews, an' dey allers follow dere leeders wid de same blind dewotion dat de polytishuns do dere different leeders, an' to 'splain dis 'kullarity, I'll tell you leetle anick- dote dat happen'd to ockur to me long time ago. One day, when I was younger den I am now, an' lib'd on my good ole massa's plantashun, afore de great lebler Deff kum 'long an' karrid him off to de berrin' ground. I war a gwane to hoe korn in de feeld, an' I trow'd my hoe ober my sholder, an' started. In gettin' to de korn feeld I had to cross a paster lot whar a hole flock ob shetp war a grazin'. When I jumped- ober de fence dey set up a terable blattin', dat sound like a kamp meetin', an' dey all run to de odder side ob de lot, jis whar I war a gwane. Well, de sun had got up a good while afore brexfuss dat mornin', an' he make my shad- der on de groun' look twice as big as me, an' my hoe handel's  shadder look long as a well sweep. Well, when dese foolish sheep seed me a kamin' towards 'em, de ole he ram rushed pass'd me, an' when he kum to de shadder ob de hoe handel he jumped four feet high to get ober it, an' ef ebery sheep in de hole flock warn't fool enuf to do de same ting, I hope I may neber hab my sallery raised to a libin' pint. I laff'd tull I swet like race hoss to see de sheep jump, and den I tort dat dar am odder fools in dis world 'sides. dem, dat mis- take de shadder for de substance, ebery day. ' De oldest ram am ginerly de leader ob de flock, an' he allers look in de face like a man newly shabed and powdered. You will noe Mr. Rain by his horn: aldo "he cannot conwe- nantly blow it. He wares it more for' ornament den use.   WOOLLY.           21- He moss allers hab too, an' dey am sitewated on de hed, jis like dey am on a good many odder sheeps' heds, found 'mong mankind. Sumtimes de ole ram gits in a fite wid anudder ole he feller, an' den he uses his horns to sum purpose, a  buttin' his antygonist. Dar horns am allers as crooked as a sute at law, an' sumtimes it happen dat dey git so dubble an' tribley corkscrewed togedder dat it take dem a hole day to get out ob tangle. Notwidstanin' de sheeps am sich a inosent set ob creturs, dey am one ob de- moss useful to be foun' in de hole book, an' aldo dey don't noe mnuch, what, I ax you, kood we 'speck from a sheep's hed? Dey ain't ob much use while libin', 'ceptin for dar wool, which am used to make flannel shirts for de African childern on de kost ob Siberia, an' dey am more lucky den moss odder people, kase dey only git fleeced once a year, while I an' meny odders' git fleeced ebery day. i. De lam am dd puttyest kind ob sheep, an' eberybody lub to see 'dem play, as ef dey war kittens on de grass. In  '  anshunt times, afor de City Hall was bilt, dey used to offer , N dese lams as a sacrifice 'mong de hedens; an' ef we am to ! belibe de butchers, lam am offer'd at de same rates now. Do sheep, like de poet, de hog, an' de foolosefer, am-more appreciated arter dey are ded den while in a libin' state, kase den dey am konwerted into sheep, lam, an' mutton.

De only ting I will 'fur to am his tail, which am ob no more use to him den a pump handle. He don't need one, an' darfer he neglects it, an' dar it hangs down like a penny candel. History sez, dat sum ob dar tails in warm klymates grow so big an' X1   22         BLACK DIAMONDS. fat dat de shipperd hab to bild a little wagon to karry it in, which am, ob korse, fastened to de sheep, an' dat's de oney time de sheep tail am seen in a wagin condishun.

HAIRY. "ADIES AND GEMMEN: IT am oberwhelmin proof dat a great thirst for nolage hab bin wakened in your minds, to see you all turn out dese cold nites to har your suspected lecturer lucidate de grate an' fundimental principels ob siance, and ef de colleckshun wus only large nuff to buy a haff a ton insted ob a haff a peck ob cole at a time, your toses and noses wood be a good, deel more comfurtable. I shall on dis 'tickler 'casion lectur on de history, costume, and occepashun ob- DE GOAT. De goat, my ignumrent harers, muss be one ob de moss beuiful anamiles in crisendom, or else de buck dandies would not try so hard to make demseffs look so much like him. It seems to me dat as soon as a young man's beard shows itseft suffishent to indicate de approach ob whiskers, his ambition is to cultivate it to look like de Billy Goat, and den as soon qm F   HAIRY .          23 as a positive goatee am rased he puts on a crewat wid de ends stickin out each side,ob he head, which make him look like a he goat wid a yoke on to keep he head out ob mis- chief, and den he may be called a buck goat.       7 Dar am two kinds ob goats; de Billy goat and de Nanny goat. De one am de hemale and de odder de shemale. You will see a grate many ob de former round de treets New Yeer's day, wen you ob korse kjn 'zammon de anamile in a perfect state ob labender. De shemale goat gibs milk jis de same as de cow only not so much ob it, nor is it as good as ole mudder cow's, kase you karnt make butter nor cheese wid it. De hemale don't gib enything but butts. De goat am found all ober town, 'speshely round hoss stables mong de hosses. Dey am berry fond ob hosses, and like to sleep wid dem wen dey donat kick. He am a berry corragous anamile, and will fite wid odder goats till he die. I don't belibe dey tink demseff as good lookin as de dandies tink dey am, kase ef you put a looking-glass whar he can see heseff, he will at once, widout de least sarahmoney, raise heseff upon he hind legs and make fite at he own likeness and butt de glass into a tousand pieces. Sometimes dey butt odder tings beside goats. Ef dey don't happen to like de 'pearance ob a sheep or a man dey will go at em like a house a fire. Ole Brudder Sampson was butted off de bridge one day by one ob dese fellers. He had bin a fishin , and was standin nie de side ob de bridge, and was a stoopin over pickin up he fish, when a, big he Billy Goat, not likin ? de way Samson rounded up, rushed at him and butted him on de trousers and oberboard he went. Billy looked at him in de water for a minit, and den run and skipped round in de greatest glee to see de mischief he had done. He am full ob pluck, but we nebber see him jine eny ob de soger com- penies. He am a berry wicked feller, and it am easy seen   24         BLACK DIAMONDS. what am ment by compairin de wite trash to de goat.

In anser to de kummitty dat wated on me and wished to noe what would be moss excepshunable to me fur a New Year's present, I hab de honor to say dat I want a new pair ob second hand trouserloons mity bad, and my boots wants haff solein berry bad-de snow has played de debbil wid dem boots-dese, wid a hundred Cow Baaclams, would be tankfully recebed, purwidin I git an obercoat and a Hun- garian hat wid dem.

De whale, my frens, am seldom found in enny odder place den de Middleterainin, an' de Specific Oshuns, aldo dar was a yung Daneish gemman, named Hamlet, dat de 'posle Shakspeare slew'd in a dewel, an' an old fogey, named Pelo- nius, dat tort dey seed sumfin berry like it in de clowds; but it turned out to be a camel. De peeple dat go arter de whales am called whalers. Now, my ole skool master was a whaler; but he neqber was to see in he lifetime. But I'm off de track ob my diskorse, like a spil'd lokomotiff. De whale am 'mong de fishes what de. elemfint an 'Imong beastesses; de biggest lofer ob dem all. A fisherman, named Jona, swaller'd one once; but it oberloded he stum- muck to dat degree dat in tree days he leff 'em up agin. It war too much ob a muchness for him. When you fuss see one ob dese fellers at see, you see sum- fin' wurth seein', as he am spurtin' de water up true he nose, 2   /          0 26         BLACK DIAMONDS.              v* like de Park fount'n. Soon as de man aloff, in de royal top-gallen main chains sees himn true he spiglass, he sings out ,at once to de man dat got charge ob de seller dore dat swings on 'hind de ship, "Luff! blast you eyes, luff!" Den de cap'n kums on de poop deck an' pulls out he gemometer, an' takes a elewashun. Dell you hear his woice, '"Take in a reef ob de bowsplit, an' unship) de hatchway ob de hen- koop for axion. Put out you jib an' tackle, an' take de kerboose house up stairs."' Den you see de sailors run roun' like kittens, up an' down de mass bed. Den you har de mate sing out tru a fire horn, "Ebery man take tree hitches i at he trowsers an' a chow ob bacco, an' be darn quick 'bout !, it. Take a reef in de mainmass, an' luff go de rudder. ,' Splice de mein-brace. Down wid de jib-boom, an' up wid de still yards, an' put on de pot. Now de 'citement begins, i kase de ole whale am 'sashain nie to de lubber's side ob de !lship. Tow, de cap'n, bravely drows his led pencel, looks 'tru his ginbometon agin. Take down de longertude, lasses- / tude an' a glass ob brandy. Den he get red in de face wid ! de 'citement, an' calls to de men, "Boys, man de botes an' ' look out for whale." Den de boys git in de batto bote, an' as dey take de harpoon wid dem, tied to 'bout five miles ob bed cord, an' 'way dey row to de whale. When dey git 'long- side ob de monster, he look big as Cooney Island, an' den an ole whaler in white pants, straw hat, an' a long black !t ribbon on it, gumps 'pon de ole whiale's back, alln' gits up nie he hed, an' feels for a soft spot, which, as soon as he fin's, he sticks de harpoon in an' swims to de bote. Den de ole whale dives rite doun to de bottom ob de see, an' de man in de bote pays out de lined dat's fass to de harpoon, as fass as a man dats got a lor-sute pays out money. Arter de ole whale rolls heseff on de bottom, to get de harppoon out he hed, an' he sees he can't do it, he git mite   -  OILY.         27 mad, an' kums up an' make fite wid de ship, an' hits it a crack wid he tail, which am as big as a full grown barn dore. Dat make de cap'n "smile" agin, an' he orders more harp- poons in de whale's back. Dis am soon dun by de krew, an' de poor whale kums week from de loss ob blood an' he temper, an' gibs up he ghoss. Sumtimes he hits de leetle bote, when all de men am in it, an' stabes it all to ttinder, an' 'way flys de men up in de air, like man kites, an' kum down agin kerswat in de water. Well, arter de 'whale am ded, dey cut him up in chunks an' haw! him on borde, an' sich stakes you nebber did see. Sturgeon am no suckemstance to 'cm. Why dey am 'nuff to make codfish balls for all ole King Cole's army. When he am all cut up, de saylers 'pear to feel bad 'bout him, an' dey all go to blubberin'.

De one am used for feedin' de luminary apperate- sus, an' de odder for makin' de ladies' korsits wid when dey ribe home to Nantucket. De whale am  de big fish--de codfish aristocracy ob de sees, de same as de big, bugs an' de codfish aristocracy ob de lan'; but de former hab gotde 'wantage ob de latter, kase, notwidsfanin' de whale dewoures a good eel, he pro- duces sumfin, but de ]an' codfish aristocracy dewours ebery- ting, an' produces nuffin'. Dat's all I fine 'bout de whale, an' I read de Pilgrim's Progress rite true, n' it didn't say nuffin 'bout it.

Dis onsult, ob koorse, we coodn't pass, We met, and wrote him -down-an ass. At de meetin' dar war sebral speeches, By brudders, dat 'moss buss dar breeches,  Wid elemquence an' indignation 'Ginst eberyting like kulonization.  We passed a wote by acklemation, Dat de black folks best ob all creation, An' show'd de abolish'nists plain, Dat we cood see rite tru dar game. Ole Hunt sees de race absquatchelate, But kan't tell wat produce dis state. But'I kin, an' by your approbation, I'll name it-Amalgamation!

Anty Clawson sez she'd gib a doller, To hab a wite man try to fool her; She sez, ef dey'd come -roun' her, she'd lam Dem on de hed wid Cowhay clam; Darfor, I 'wise Bill Seaweed, an' all sich, To 'woid de seller as dey would de ich; But I'm off de track ob wat I ment to site, Wen I kum liar dis blessed nite.

Ef we go dar, to work we got to go, A ting all darkies lhate, you noe; Darfor, I tink, we'd all be fools, To try to larn de use ob tools. Wat do we want to noe 'bout bricks, Or bildin' houses, an' sich tricks? Ef we larn dese tings, an' sich like, We'll hab to work from morn till nite. No longer kan we lofe 'roan docks Or markets, but muss work like ox-- No longer dance de jig ain' reel, At Kafrinte Market, for de lunch ob eel No longer for de porgies sinrg, Nor dance de juba in de rilg; All our pleasure will be gonlle away, Whenl kuloiization gits de sway. Tru, dar we all wood lib togedder, One black man jis as good as tedder; We'd haD our own laws an' skools, But wat's all dis, you simple fools, If you got to work to make it? Darfor, I say, de debel take it.

But I muss stop dis brilliant epic here, Bekase its growin' late, I feer.

LECTURE VII. HORNY. EFLUBIOUS BRUDDERN: You will -find de tex ob my diskorse dis ebenin a swimin' in enny ob de fresh water ribers or ponds, trouout de country, an' ef you want to noe in pertickler wat dat am, I will tell you. I mean to 'liten you on de beauties ob de CAT FISH. Dis fish am n lofer fish, enny how you can fix him. On klose 'zamenashun he will remind you ob seberal tings you can't tink ob. He's as humbly as a boss ired skinned, an' he's all ftiouff like a clam, an' darfor he am also likewise like a skoldin' wife, all jaw, an' he look like a cullerd man wen he laff, in de, countenance. He eyes am on de top ob he hed, so he can't look down on eny ob de odder fish, like de big codfish aristokracy dat swim abuv Union Squaredo on de odder fish below dat inflated region. He am slimy as slander all ober, anll as slippery as a gold doller. Sum cullerd men s'pose dat dese fish am sum 'lation to ole Belze- bub, kase he got horns like dat augustus personage. But aldo he wears de horns, he am no kin to de debil, an' ef all mankind dat am sitewated like de cat fish in dis respect, am to be classed in 'inong -his 'latives, he wood hab too big a famaly to feed. Darfor I say unto you, in de lang'wage ob de poet, de cat fish am not de debil, more am de debit a cat fish.   HORNY.           33 I sed in de fussklaus ob dis epic dat de cat fish am a lofer. I still stick to dat fack ef it "'make Rome houl." De reeson I say he am a lofer am kase he distroys more den he earns, an' de man dat does dat am a lofer all de world ober, an' we all know dat de caty does dat ting. He am a sucker, an' like de lofer he libs by suckshun, an' sucks in he nabors, perwidin' dey im small 'nuff to anser hie purposes. He am like de Cauabells we hear ob 'mong de mishenarys, kase he eats he own children; but I b'lebe he ginerly per- fers odder fishes' bodies. I don't noe why he am called de cat fish, onless it am bekase he am such a pussylanamus feller, and pussylanamus am catamount to beil' called a ramtomas. One, reeson dey call him so may be 'kase he am so sportive an' kitten like when he am out ob de water. If dar am one fish dat de fisherman 'spise an' abhor more den anudder, it am dis same tom cat fish, kase dey fool em so offul. You nebber node one ob des e fish to take rite hold ob de hook like a 'spectable week fish or tom cod. No. Dey go sneekin' round de bate bitin' off de side a little now an' a little den, tryin' to steel de bate, an' it am only when you gib a galwanick jirk, an' hook him in de topper jaw dat you kotch him, an' den you mnay safely make up your mind dat you got him on a string. Well, wen you got him, wat den? Look out how you fool your time wid him, or you'll get he horn in your hand, for he am sure to make fite wid you. Brudder Bob Roberts, ob New Orleans, rites me a berry perfectic story 'bout he, an ibeseff, Simon Bines, he, -an' heseff a gwane a fishin' to de lake ob Pont-char-mn- tram, nie dat Creshent City, whar de battles ob Lake Shampain and Erie Canal was fit, an' he 'scribes how he got de horn ob de cat fish in he hand, an' in slingin' de fish off he fell on de spot war Simon war jis a settin' down, an' 2*   34         BLACK DIAMONDS. Simon set on de fish, an' jumped up immediately, ef not sooner. But didn't Simon rub an' swar, an' didn't he lam dat fish? May be not, an' may be yes; but Bob sez he war mitey glad he warn't dat cat fish 'bout dat time. De fate ob de cat fish an' de fate ob de green countryman am boff alike, wen edor cum to dis city, kase dey boff get X -beaufully skin'd. De former am allers well kooked, but de latter, aldo he am konsidered well done, he ginerly remains as raw as eber. Dat's all I find out 'bout de cat fish. Ef de telligrafick noose sez enny ting 'bout him, I'll let you noe nex week. I is imnquested to state dat de black swan, accumpanyed by sebreal wite an' black brudders, will ribe in dis city soon, an' I speck she will gib a consart at Pete Williams' or sum odder place. It am 'spected de wooley heds ginerly will turn out in one muss: an' 'scorch her tru Larence street an' de Five Pints. She will lay all de wite trash singers out cold:- De fame ob Jenny Lind Will be wasted to de wind, An' no longer we hear de praises Of no more Cafrine Hayzes; But all de praise will be let loose, On de black swan, alias goose. To make dat lass line rime, I got to say goose dis time. Sister Swan may not be,sich a sweet singer, but she will be found a mitey strong one.

De town am goin' mad 'bout it, an' unless I come out an' settle de hole ting in one full swope, I don't noe to wat pitch de peepil will git demseffs. Dar am no noein' wat wood becum ob dis cummunity ef it wasn't for your humble speeker. I blush, as much as sarcumstances will admit, to tink dat I am de great leder .dat ballances public 'pinion in dese days. De subjick dat I hab reference to dis ebenin' am call'd on de-han'bills all 'bout town- PSYCHOLOGY. an am one ob de modern siances 'culiar to dis klimate. Sykeology am  deribed from de name of Sykesy, an' Sykesy war de man spoken o'b in- de anchent history ob Joe Sefus, who war so politely quested by Moses to " take de butt." Dis history dates fudder back dan de fuss axedent on de Harlem Railroade, an' dat you noe am a long time ago. Sykesy war a lazy dissyple, an' nebber wood take de butt, unless he war drobe to it. He pertended to study' siance, an' one ob his siances war dis, which am suspishusly' called arter his name. Dar am a good menny perfessers ob t  r   836         BLACK DIAMONDS. dis siance rtnninh round an' doin' de peepil brown whenebber dey git a chance. As de public mind am berry much cogitated -'bout de matter, I 'eluded to go to one ob de 'xrbishons' an' see how it war done, an' settle de pint by tellin' you all I noe 'bout it. An' I tink I got dem perfessers dis time on de hip.   Sykeology am a sister siance to musmerism, mental acho- hal, an' de odder black arts or blygards, I forgit now which. It consists ob puttin' de folks to sleep, while dey am wide awake, an' make em cut up all kinds ob shindees wid dar eyes wide open. In short, it ama gittin' drunk widout enny ob de useal stimelets, an am considered by de larned a new doge ob de temperance allegience. But I'll 'splain de hole ting to you, an' not keep you in suspended anxiety no longer. Ef you want to be frown in de state, as dese perfessers call it, you muss go dar, anll' go up to de platform, an den de perfesser look at you smack in de eye, as brabe as a sheep. Den he gib you a piece ob money to hold in your hand, arter he blows he breff on it, an' den he passes he han's ober you face to pull de wool ober you eyes, an' den he can make you b'lebe you am Andrew Jackson Allen, Major Crawley, Gen.

Den he can make you sing a song, laff, or cry a hole bason full ob tears, jis as he likes, and arter dat he can tA ch a bump, an' let you cum to yourseff, an' feel as flat as -,my pocket book. Now all dis seem queer, strange, an' unaccountable to de ignumrent; but to me an' de rcss ob de stugents ob siance, its as clar as lager bier. You all see dat dis delusion am brot 'bout by piece ob money. Well, you-all noe dat money am de root ob all ebel, darfor it muss be dat it cum from de ole debil heseff, aan' here I will state, for inflammashun, dat notwidstan'in' it am so much ob an ebel, all de churches an' all de preechers   SYKESY TAKING THE BUTT.        3 don't 'pear to care how much ob dis ebel dar am on hand 'bout dese days. Well, den, dis money bein' closely related to de ole square foot feller, it am naturally to be s'posed he got a big finger in de pite, an' dis I tink am de fac. De in- fluence ob a piece ob money on some peepil's hands am always different from odders; but wen it am charged wid dis mental alcohol, as dey call it (which am noting else but de debel in a liquid form), it act on de lumbolus muzzels ob de human sistem, an' de lumboluses aggrewates de artickular fibres, which, actin' in a direct function on de catagory nerves, an' de perry nostrum wessels am conducted fru de culinary canal, which am widen'd for de purpose, an' fines its way to de gastric juces, whar it am mejetly sent by de tubical ob de heel to de brane pan. When de brane pan am full ob de influence, den you can 'sperement on de cree- tur, an' make dem play tom fool as long as, you-like, kase de creter am den as full ob de ole Belzebubl as a big wood- chuck. Now, you noe all 'bout de' siance ob Sykeology 'bout as well as de perfessers demseffs; but I warn you not to fool wid it, noe how, for ef de fluids go, rong, an' you shood put I  de money in you pocket, insted ob holdin' it in your hand, dar's no noein' what de consequence mout be. Likenuff when you "cum to," you'd find youseff colapsed in de Tooms, or some odder place ob recreation. Brudder Kel Longlogue will pleese pass roun' de sasser, an' luck out for bad pennies.

BLUBED SINNERS: De words ob my text on dis 'portant 'casion you can't find in eny ob de books dat hab bin printe-dnor in eny ob de noose papers, kos I neber spake from dem afore, but neberaeless dey am giss as good as do dey had been sounded from one end ob de world to de odder, tro de tel- lugraff or Baalam's trumpet. De words am- "GO TO HEBBEN YOUR OWN RODE.   THE NEW ROAD.          41 I noe, my 'spected hearers, dat all de different 'nominations will be down on me for telling you dis, kase dere am none dat will 'low you dat pribelige; dey all tell you dat if you don't belibe jis as dey do, and come into de 'tablished church, you am lost obberboard in de big gulf ob sin; all de churches am 'tablished churches, and dey all tink de rode dey hab picked out trough de miserable thickets ob truble, wexations, and odder grevences ob dis life, am de rite one, and de odders am all rong. Bishop Hughes says dat -his creed am de only one dat will popelate hebbin, and de pris- beterians, on hearin dis 'sertion, held a meetin right away at de Tubernicle, an' contadicted de hole ting, told some good nany-gotes 'bout ole Giles Croggins' hoss and kart, and spirsed satified dey wor on de rite rode. De Metodist, de 'piscopailfulls, de Baptist, de Tairrians an' Worsilest, all tink dey see de golden gates ob hebben rite afore dem, and feel sure ob being 'wited in to take a seet as soon as dey nock at de dore. Dey am gis like a lot of skoolboys playing base, dey all see hunk, but all take a different paff, in order to git in fust.. Now, my ungrateful frens, I don't want to say dat eny ob dese 'nominations' am wrong, but I am goin to take my own rode, and cut cross lots. I am goin to do unto all I meet de same as I'd wish dem to do unto me-treat dem kindly-relieve all de sufferin' I kin along de paff, and when I reach de golden gate, I shall strip myself ob all de worldly tings, and 'pear wid de nacked truff for my breast plate, and I tink by ilein myself all ober wid de ointment 'posed ob lub, charity, and faith, dat I will slip in while St. Peter am 'zaminin de credentials of Brudder Beecher and Brudder Hughes. If I kin, git a chance to say a sly word to St. Peter, I'll ask him if charity am one ob de principal foun- dations of Christianity? and if he say yes, which I tink he will, den I'll tell him dat Brudder Beecher show no charity   42         BLACK DIAMONDS. toward de actor people, an I'll take his lectur on de 'bolishin ob teatres in my pocket, and show it to him, wherein he see dat Brudder Beecher sends all de actors to hell wedder or no ; den St. Peter will say, "dat don't look christin like, but delln Brudder Beecher got much charity and lub for de nigger race, of which you, as a member, should feel tankful and prowd. It shows 'clusively dat he lubs darkey more dan actor." Yes, I'll 'mark, dats a fad, he does tink colored man better dan actor man, kase de colored man don't interfere wid he bread and butter; but I don't, so long as de actor man beharves hisself. My lubed Sisters and Brudders, you can all git to hebben if you like, and 'woid de big lake dat I spoke 'bout toder week. To do dis, you mus go true de world wid a clare conshuns, kick hipocracy to de 'ole debil, where it belongs, rong nobody, help one anodder along in de trials ob life; keep out ob debt and all de low rum shops; stop playin bluff; don't steal anyting, not eben a chicken; do as near rite as you noe how; and try to learn to do all de good your limited sphere of life will 'low, and you hab as good a sight for a front seat in hebbin as de loudest brawler among de whole tribes ob mankind; you, ob course, hab got to do your duty jis as well as de rich. influenshul man hab'9 got to do his'n, an' one ob your duties am to put all de money you kin in de plate, when Brudder Gustus Lemonskins hans it round.

DEAR SISTERS AND BRUDDERN: You will find de words of my text for this ebenin' in de 'gography written by an ole gouty gemman, named Peter Parley, de text reads dus, "Dis, world is round, and, like a ball, Seems swinging in de air." Now, my ignorant deciples, you 'must know -dat dere am seberil kinds of. worlds ; dere's de teatrical world, whare de theatrds fust come from ; den dere's de literary world, whare all de literary come from ; den dere's de world ob fashion, whar all de " bong tong" lib; den dere's de world- ob sciance, ob which world I claim to be a native. But none ob dese worlds am de world ment in de tex ; de world ment dere am dis sircumlambula busitarian world, on which we am at dis minute restin' our enlarged understandins. But how de foolosefers ob old find' out it am round am a puzler to me. De fust magn who said dis world to be round !   "        -BLACK DIAMONDS. was a schoolmaster dat libed prebiously just arter de flood, by de name ob So-crates, and de peeple all laffed at him, an' ole King Cruso, who rained at de time, seeinm dat he node so much pholosphy, cotched him one nite while he was on a coon hunt, and got him into de Tombs, and pizened him wid mixture of padlock bark, and Mr. So-crates drink him down jis like cider spirits, smacked his lips, pulled up his shirt collar, an' laid himself down an' died. He was a 'stonishiug perssin, 'cordin to Hoil's 'counts ob him. He :Jibed in a sugar hogshead, and led a sweet existence. De next man dat 'serted de fac was de ole rheumatfc genius whose' poetry serbes your 'litened, laborer wid a tex dis ebenin. De fac ob de world being round, like a big pumkin, seems to strike your understandings in a 'circular way, and make all you eyes look big as sassers. I'll e'splain de holl ting to you so you will know hencearter all 'bout it, jis as well as odder peeple. You must noe, in de fust place, dat dis world am bounded north by de Pasific Ocean, as fur as longitude North Pole, an' on de east by de Gipsian Pira- mids, 'south by Witney'ss Railroad depot, and west by de Rocky Mountains. Dere am a South Pole, as well as a North Pole. De South Pole am made ob a mity big red hot crowhar, bigger den 130011 liberty poles, an' on de top of it de world rests one end ob itself on its axel-trees. De odder end rests on de North Pole, which 'cordin to Spoke- shake, am made of icebergs. De odder end ob de big axle- ' tree dat runs true dA middle ob de globe rests on de top 'ob dis pole, an dat's what bring new-year's day in de cold sea- son, and you see what keeps de world in proper equolibriam trimmins, and perwents It from upsettin' earsterly or west- erly, am de mighty Gipsian Pyramids on de one hand, an' de spontaneus Rocky Mountains on de odder. Dis I found out myself! Some times dese axle-trees want greasing, to   THE WORLD AS IT IS.        45 make it slip round easy, an' how dey go to work to do it remains one ob de "Misteries of Adolphin." I tink dat de arthquakes dat we read so much 'bout in de papers, am caused by de takin' down ob one or odder ob the axel-trees, when dey go to grease de top ob de pole. An' one ob dese days, my stingy hearers, de North or South Pole will give way, an' bust up all creation. De wolcanoes will fall on de icebergs an' melt dem all up into water, wyich will oberflow dis world, and you will be swamped alive! In sich a case o- 'mergency, I would 'wise you all to rush for de ferry:., boat, an' git on Brooklyn Hights, as soon as de will ob Providence and power ob steam will carry you; dar you will find de wicked cease from grumblin, and de lazy am at rest. Dis watery pictur dat I draw afore your distorted wisages may be 'sidered out ob place in dis season ob brandy toddy, gin slings, whiskey punches, hot stuff, an' Jersey lightnin'; but noein' you all got pretty well corned on new-years, I thought a more refreshing subject could not be touched 'pon on dis 'portant 'casion. I myself got a little dizzy in de head an' sick at de stomack, after makin' 437 calls 'mong my flock, which may in a small (horn) measure 'polagise for my disinterestin' discorse this ebenin. Noin dat, so soon arter de holidays, it would be useless, I fourbear passing round de sasser on dis 'casion.   "         BLACK DIAMONDS. LECTURE XII. FACETIOUS. "ADIES AND GEMME'N: MY discourses dis ebenin will be drawn from de annals of sciance, according to Gunter, and de scianee I 'tend to lite on your understandings wid, will-be de sci- ance ob NOSEOLOGY. Noseology, my frens, had a good deal to do wid tings ob dis life, for by it you can tell to wat race every man you meet in de street b'longs. Noseology, ob course, means nose ob de face obh vite man, red man, black man, half black man, and monkey. Dere am sebril classes ob noses, which was classed in King Crusoe's time, under de heads of Weget(ble noses, Hook noses, Roman noses, Pug noses, Grecian noses, and flat and Poke noses, and odder noses dat 1- nose not ob. De wega- table nose am wulgerly called turnup noses. Dese kind am bery prebilent wid young misses when dey git a new bo, if dey happen to meet dere old bo in de street. Anodder wegetable nose am de redish; dese am generally found on the faces ob ole bachelors'who had patronized de dimajog frequently offen. Some time dese redish noses wegetate and cumulate, one on top ob de odder, till dey am piled up like a heap ob pabin stones on a load ob red sand, and dis my ignorant frens, am what Spokeshape means by de tex, On horror's head horrid noses' cumulate.   FACETIOUS.         47 De redish nose am often called de Rumen nosede hook nose is most frequently met in Chatham street, 'mong de Jews; and wo be to de customer who gets hooked under dere nose. He's sure to be sold someting better ash new, and sheep as dirt. De hook nose is some 'mong de yankees up East. Joseph Miller, Esq., an elderly gemmon, node one wunst, dat had sich a big one dat when he went to pick cherries, he used to hang by de limb wid it, and pick wid boff hands; dey made him President ob de hook and ledder company. De Roman nose seems to be a mistery mong all de foolosefers, and Mr. Milton, or some odder fur seein' chap, said dat No one nose What a Roman nose. Derefore I pass on dem kind ob noses, and splain de pug nose. Dis nose seems to be permiscusly sent by human natur to all babies, who seem proud ob dem from de time it am no bigger den a piece ob putty wid two holes in it, till it swell to de size ob de hickory nut. Natur seems, inll gibin de finishin touch to babies, to hab hit dem on de end ob de nose and turned it up so it would not be in dar way in gitting dere sebril meals a day from de mudder ; dese little noses am none as Greesein, as de child grow up 'sue- cially on cold mornins. , De next nose under 'sideration am de poke nose; dese am de wust noses. of all.

THE FALL OF MAN. MY BELUBED HERERS ' - '  You hab no dout herd many lexshures on, an many preecher men spoke bout de FALL DOWN OF MAN. De poet hab sung elaborately on de subjeck-de painter hab tutch it wid de. faiery strokes ob de pencil-de most eminent warriors hab wrote upon it-de newspapers hab t'alked bout it-an it hab been a standin' puzzler to all ,   632         BLACK DIAMONDS. debatin' societies since de kommencement ob time. But, in my humble pinion,- not one ob dem hab trown de least lite on de subjeck: an' darefore, arter burning sebril quantities ob midnite camphene in de research arter facs in de kase, I hab concluded to splain de hole matter, so as to set de questshun at rest for eber arter. You must not spose dat de poet means, wen he sez " de fall ob man," dat de man Adam fell down on de ground by stubbin he toe agin a stumnp, or a stone in de Garden ob Eden, or dat de apple he eat was komnposed of sumpting, dat operated on de nee jints, ani made dem so weak dat he kudent stand! for dat was not so. You noe, Adam an Ebe was made ob human natur, an placed in de Garden ob Eden, in de land ob paradise. Dis garden was de most luxurious spot de earth eber produced. Wen dey was turned loose in dis pasture, dey war told dat all dis magnificent place War dares an nobody elses. Dey war shown de big fig tree, war dey kood retrete from de burning rays ob de sun at noon-day, an dey was shown de elegant bower made ob grape wines and honey-suckers, warein dey kood lay down at nite an sleep in peace and blissful innocence. But dey war also told dat all outside de fence belonged to de owner dereof, an dey must not tuch ennything beyond it, or dey would rue it as long as dey libed, an a good wile arterwards. In order to more fully splain how man kum to fall, I will hab to diskribe de siterwashun ob de garden itself. You see dis garden*as on de top ob a high, steep, big green hill, frequently called Mount Zion. Dis hill was sur- rounded on all sides by a deep gully, an was fenced in at de brink ob dis gully by a slight inklosure. Well, one day Adam and Ebe was takin a walk, an lookin ober de fence, -dey spied a moss lubly apple tree on de outside, wid apples   THE FALL OF MAN.        58 growin' on it dat shone in de sun like a newhrass button in a nigger's mouf. Wen Ebe see dem it make her mouf water, an'she said to Adam, "My lub, jis git one ob dem apples, for me,-will you?"  "Shan't do it," said Adam, "kase dey don't belong to us." Jis at dis minnit a debil ob a big snake stuk he bed out ob de branches, an sed-. "Look ahear, Mr, Adam, you must be green to say dat, kase dart aint noboddy else in de world to eat dem but you and Mrs. Adam, an ob korse dey am yoars." "Dat's a fack," said Ebe, "so you stop your nonsense, an jus git up on de fence an reach me one ob dem apples!P "I don't like to," said Adam, "an, besides, I don't belebe 1 ood reach dem, dey am so far off." "Well," said Ebe, " if you'ln no more ob a man dan dat, I'll do it mysef." So she got upon de fence, and de snake gib her one ob de apples, an she in turn gib it to Adam, an coaxed him to eat. He took a bite an found it so mitey nice dat he Jumped upon de fence, an den dar war a race between him an Ebe to see who kood git de most; an in de struggle dey boff lost dar balance by reacin too fur, an oberboard dey went down in de gully ob sin. Dey must hab slid on der backs, kase dey am kalled de fust back- sliders. Dis, my frenis, was de "Fall ob Man," luded to, bekase dey was de fust man dat fell arter de kreashun; an dey woodent hab fell if dey had not wanted wat dey otn't to git.     -  Wat a lesson dis teeches all ob us who am discontented "wid our lot, alnd am grasping for tin(gs beyond our reach.

Den she will ax you "IKill novela av a beas?"  Dat means "Wat's de news?"  Den you say, "Nous verrons."  Dat means Colonel Webb's got home, and looks " distingeree."

De Rochester Nockers hab claimed de 'tention ob de pub- lic mind for a year or two, and so excited de nerves ob Pro-   SPIRITUAIL RAPPERS.       57 fessor Greeley, dat he immediately took to eatin' beef-stake and onions, instead ob de saw-dust puddill' ob Mr. Graham to raise his spunk 'fishently to unwestirgate de matter in a proper manner, in all its ramifications. De fust de world ebber node ob Rochester Nockers was durin' de rain ob King Charles de Second ob England. De fast Rochester Nodcker on record am de Earl ob Rochester, who is sed to nock around more den eny udder man ob his time,. specely 'mong de ladies. Dis gemlnan was none to gib subril nocks on de head ob people who made it dere bisness to attend to ,his instead ob dere own. Dey say he was one ob de nockers when he got in a muss ; he could always fite his wait, let kiim find it war he would. De next notice de public hab ob Rochester Nockers was in de village bearin' dat name, siti- wated jis back ob Albany, war de House ob Kongress sets, in de Kourt ob Sessions. Here a party ob high spirits con- gregated, an' nocked tables an' chairs about in de most misterious and promisquis manner, at a dollar a head; and de fun ob it am, none ob dese spirits can be seen; but dey am like de good boys my grandfadder used to tell me 'bout, "dey am heard but not seen." Dis fac set de country in a blaze, an' sebril preacher mans undertook to sleep in de house war de " spirits" was a cuttin' up, but most ob dem got enough ob it afore mornin', and came to breakfast so agemtated, dat dey could not tell a sassage from a piece ob eel, and dey always left, forgitin' to pay for dere logins; howeber, as dis last claws is frequently noticed 'mong de clergy, it may not be 'sidered strange in dis case. Dere was a curious case ob Nockin 'curred in a cullered family in dat city one night lass winter, which may be set down as bein' done by bad spirits. De facs ob de case am dese: Old Tone Smock married a putty, likely lookin' molatto 3*   / 58         BLACK DIAMONDS. gal, most ten years his junitoe, and went and dwelt in dis same town of Rochester, and one nite ole Tone was 'gaged to sit up and watch at de house, war de nockers was a gibin dere exhimbishions, and it so happened dat he got frighten- ed, and run home in de middle ob de nite time, and swore he'd neber hab notin' to do wid eny spirit, 'septin' dose ob de most ardent character. When he reached his house, he put his hand true de broken pane ob glass, and onbolted de dore, and in he went smack dab, as de Yankees say, into his bed-room, which so skared his wife dat she hollar fire. In de 'fusion he tort he hear somebody slip under de bed, but he was so frightened wid de nockers, dat he daesent look for fear he find a bad spirit. So he slipped off he close, and he slipped into bed and covered he head wid de bed close, shakin' like de reputation ob some ob de Wall street brok- ers. Well, he hadn't bin in bed long, and his wife had gis finished sayin' she didn't b'lieve he was at de hunted house a-tall, but had bin arter de gals, when he felt somefin' push up from under de bed dat feel jis like de back ob camel, and at de same time he heard a knock on de floor, jis like a cul- lered man's heel, and a noise as if somebody rush towards de doe, and as he raised his head from under de close he seed a tall dark figar slope out ob de house. Dis skared him more dan eber, and he nily turned white. "Wat's dat?" he gasped to Mrs Smock. "Wat?" axed she, as innocent as chile. -"Dat big ting, jis lebe de house." "I didn't see any big ting; lay down; does delish nock- ers ober dere to Foxes set you crazy; lay down; notin' bin here." Well, Tone lay down, but not to sleep. He kipt his top eye open, till daylite, when to his surprise and wonder he seed a man's hat settin on de table. He sprang to de table, \   A NEW RECI1'E FOR MAKINGS GAS.    59 seized de hat, and spelt out de name of Deacon Smellgood, on de linein'. "Wat de debil brought Deacon Smellgood's hat here? Tell me quick, or I smash somebody," exclaimed ole Tone, mad as tunder. Mrs. Smock said de Deacon left it dere yesterday, to hab her sow de linin in it, aid dis petrified ole Tone, and he said no more; but in a day or two he met de deacon, and widout hesemtation nocked him down. A reglar fite come off, and Tone was found to be one ob de best Rochester Nockers in de hole digging. Dat's all I nose about de nockers. I don't want to sinemwate notin agin de character ob Mrs Smock. I don't noe notin about her. I don't noe whar she git her shiney earrings and brespins, and sich tings ; dere's no noin' whar dat new striped silk dress come from, nudder; but I shan't 'lucidate no more to-nite. Brudder'Blower will please hand round de sasser, and remember dat we neber gib change back on no condishun. LECTURE   XVII. A NEW RECIPE FOR MAKING GAS. BELUBED BREDEREN AND SISTERS  De argument dis ebenin' are one ob de brightest sub- jects dat can possibly be concebed; an' aldo it are a light one, you will percebe de necessity ob fully understandin' it 'mid odder nore waity articles; and widout furder prelimbi- nary, I will at once succeed to you on de foolosofy ob de   60         BLACK DIAMONDS. undertakin'. De subjeck, den, for dis ebenin' will be on de  manufacture and consumption of GAS. When I say gass, you musn't 'spose dat I mean de cam fene gass dat am sold for gin in de tree cent grog shops; nor de gass used by de editors ob- de daily papers wen dey speak ob 'nexin' Kuba. an' odder inflated planets; but de gass I mean am ob de infernal regins wat used to be sitewated in Center street, de gass house. De gass dat am made in de gass house am sent trew ebery street in de city by " der machine," jis like de hart trows de blood trow ebery wane ob de human body, only not half so pleasant or reglar. Dey used to make gass wen I was a stugent at de free school, out ob tar and rosin ; and den de gass was much clearer darn now-a-days, as it burned briter and cost less ; but now dey got makin' it wid coal and oder chemical commodities, which make it cost more dan in de olden time; and de Lord nose it am much wurser dan it war den; but dat's mnotin, as long as it comes higher, an' am fashionable, de people will use it. Dere seems to be a mity big eel ob mistery 'bout de gass bisiness. It burns by de feet, an' at a short meter rate; aldo de company hab a 'ticklar meter' ob dere own, iWhich dey lends to ebery body who burns de gass, an' are willin to pay a high rent for it. You will not find dis 'ticklar meter in de music book; but it am generally found behind -de doe or de counter ob de storekeepers. Dis article looks little like a small sheet iron stove, an' has a face somefin"'like a clock, wid a long hand on it. Well, ebery month, a man wid a book an' pencil in him hand comes round, an' arter lookin'. at de size ob de shop, and calculatin' de amount ob bizness done by de owner, he bery mysteriously opens de 4a   A NEW RECIPE FOR MAKING GAS.      61 "'tickler meter," an' as mysteriously chalks somefin down in- he book, an' lebes de store. In a day or two arter dat a bill comes in, statiu' dat de company will walk into you so many feet. If you 'spostulate wid dem, an' say you neber burned dat amount afore, dey will tell you " if you didn't you ought to," an' dat if de bill am not lickerdated at once, de gass pipes will be "tuck up" afore nite. Now de queshun am dis-am it rite dat de city fadders--de policemen, should 'low dere children to be 'posed on in dis triumfant manner? I answer in de most elefant manner-no I no! 1 But, says some ob you, who keep oyster and barber's shops, war's de remedy?' Must we burn spirit gass an' ile till a man am 'leckted dat will 'liten de city on dat point on him own hook? Agsain, your 'spected lecturer answers elefantly-- no! Wat den?  Why lnake your own gas   I am now coming to de most skyautific porshun ob my discord, an' I wish dat Mister William HenryfHarrison Peters, an' Miss Florinda Jemimal Watts, will please stop gabblin' till I 'splain myself to de utmost capacity. I do wish people would do dere coortin' at home. I hab, my frens, been studyin' de art ob de manufacture ob gass, to show you how easy it am made. I been reedin' all de gassy writers since de days of Josephus, de ole closeman down to de days ob Professor Greeley, an' I is fully 'swaded dat' I nose all 'bout it, an', derefore, widout beiu' gassy myseff, I will 'splain how ebery body can make dere own gass in dere own house. In de fuss place, you must get a big iron pot, an' hab a kiber dat fit it 'zactly, den you put in haff peck ob' tar, four quarts ob rossin, an' a peck ob antecrite coal, an' den put on de kiber, an' hang it ober a fier ob forty-two degrees north latitude below zebra, by ninety-four de oder way, an' bile it seben hours in de arter- noon; and den, wep it get to ten hundred an' thirty-nine   62         BLACK DIAMONDS. below the equinoxial line, nock a hole in de pot kiber, an' stick in your gass pipe; den run to de winder, firn on de  gass, an' lite it. Dat's de triumph ob genius ober de gas monopoly." Wat's dat Pete Williams axes? "'Spose de gass w6n't lite, wat's to be done den?" Well, if de gas won't lite, dere must be some fault in de ingredency, an' not in de manufacture, no how. Your belubed lecturer hab offen been axed by de out- siders, wat we lite our lecture-room wid, an' I always tell dem dat we rely on de bright eyes ob de lubly fair sex to trow a hello ob lite round de room 'fishent for ordinary purposes, wid de aid ob a few candles. I shall take up de colleckshun myself dis week. Brudder' Beecher was 'posed on last week wid tin sixpences. LECTURE   XVIII. GEOGRAPHY. l SINSEAR SINNERS : Dis ebenin' I 'tend to spoke to you on a moss 'port- ant subjeck-one dat forms one ob de great principals ob fined eddication an' 'lunor siance, an' while I am spoken I hope dat Long Island Jake an' Miss Florinda Tompsou will stop a gigglin' an' laffin', an' dat Bill Ledderhed will stop crunchin' pea-nuts. I will now kummence summin' up de bewties ob G OGRAFY. Gografy, my frens, meens de longertude, lassertude, an'   GEOGRAPHY.          63 sitewashun ob de earth, or de globe. Dat am, it tells you 'zackly war you am, wedder in de temperence zone, or de intemperence zone, or wedder you am nie de equin-oxtail line, or in de hemesfear. Derefore you kin see wid your eyes shut de great tillutity ob bein' posted in de siance. It will allers be a great stingma on de maccutcheon ob fame ob dis country dat it war. fuss diskiber'd by a furiner. But, my innocent lamls, sich am de fac. In de year 9, arter de flood, a Spanyard by de name ob Christopher Columpus, an' anudder named Uriah Westpusis, togedder wid E Pluribus Unum, charters tree fishin' smacks, an' started smack off to see, an' arter sebral lame 'tempts, landed smack at Coney Pland. One ob de botes was named de Sunflower, an' de odder de Pliminl's Rock. Ole Colum-' pus, on dat 'casion, split de world in too, kase afore dat de world war roun' an' in one i but eber since dar hab bin too hemesfears. He kut de world in too wid de broad ax ob siance, and healed de wound wid sibilization (not kuloni- zation). When he 'ribed de native Ingins was a habin' a dance on de beech, prior, prebious, before a goin in to battle,.an' when dey seed de botes a kumin' dey tort it war sum ob de Jarsey pirates kumin to steel clams, an' when one ob de Ingins axed dem whar dey kum from, an' ole Chris. sed "Spain,"' dey war mitey riled, 'kase den dey war sure dey kum from Jarsey, an' sum ob de Ingines wanted to pitch into dem an' hab a fite; but Mr. E Pluribus Unum stood on de poop deck, an' held up a Jack Jumper, an' pulled de string at he tail, an' make him jump. De Ingins seed dis, an' held up a big clam opened, which ment dat dey war open for a trade wid de furiners. Well, den de hole krew lafded, an' dey hab a jolly time. Dey at once- made a fire on de beech, put on de pot, an' made a clam chowder, an' when it was done dey made sum   "        BLACK DIAMONDS. whiskey punch, and gib it to de Ingins,an' got em all drunk; den dey crack up a trade wid dem 'bout dis i'land, war dis little York now stan's, inkludin' Long I'land, Staten I'land, Coney Iland, an' Williamsbug. De Ingins sold de hole ob it to Columpus for a mere song, but what song it war history don't say; but I 'speck it war "Yankee Doodle." Colulnpus also, likewise, darfore, gub dem a Jack Jumper, a quart ob whis- key, haff a duzen brass watch clhins, an' haff a peck ob finger rings, ear-rings, nose-rings, an' Jewsharps ; dat was afore de 'Talion Opera was 'stablished har, anl' de natives didn't noe much 'bout music. Well, den de Spanyards git a map ob de hole country ob lan's, an' git it sined by de cheef Ko- kum-ke-ku-kah, an' witnessed by Joe-jum-je-jnce-ja, his luff- tenant, an' Uriah Westpusis, an' E Pliribus Unum, an' den he filled he botes fall ob clams, an' set sale for home. When he 'ribed dar, de king took he papers away from him, swin- dled him out ob de lan', and den went to work an' eat all he clams up. You hab no dowt hurd a good deel afore 'bout Chris's hard useage arter he got home, ,ut you neber node de 'ticklers till now. When Cris ifoun' he clams war all gone, he trode heseff away on bad segars, an' worse toddies, an' he died broken hearted sumwhar 'bout de year "94, or 'bout de sixty ob Bagdad, I forget now which; but it war sumwars dar or darabouts.

DELUDED FOLLOWERS: DE lub ob siance cums back to de mind ob your sus- pected speaker in all its glory, like de inosent hen to her roost, an' darfor I shall 'splain to you on dis 'portant 'casion de 'culiar history ob de insex, none in pictur book by de name ob de RABBET. De rabbet, my fren's, ob ebery nation differ de one from de todder, 'kordin' to klimate an' nateral history. In Eng- land dey am kall'd de hair, an' am almoss de same as de native 'Merican. De Inglish an' de 'Merican rabbit am dif- ferent from de Welch rabbit. De one am flesh an' blood, an' de odder an toste an cheese, an' like an oyster, dey all good, ef properly kooked. Firstly, Dar am sebril kines ob rabbits in dis country, 'mong de different speshes ob which we find de buck, de he- male, de shemale, de ole, de young, de wite, an' de brown rabbet, all ob wich am fleet ob foot an' quick on de heel, 'specially ef dey see a dog full tilt arter dem. Secondly, Some darkies s'pose dat kase de rabbet hab got big, long ears, dat he am de jackasses baby; but sich, I is happy to say, am not de fac. A look at de size ob dar nar- ratives wood at once sassagefry de most spectickle on dat pint, kase Jack hab a long lankey narrative, wile de rabbet's am short an' stumpy, wich he sartinly wears more for orna- ment den use. I*.   "        BLACK DIAMONDS. Thirdly, De rabbet am not a kute bird, kase when he see de hunter near arter-him, he will run an' tick he hed in a stone fence, an' lebe all he body 'sposed to de clementcy ob de wedder an' mankine. He am foolish 'nuff to s'pose dat when he bed am 'skured he hole body am safe. But de hunter cum 'long an' see de stump- narative a sti kin' out, an' he kotches him jis as slick as I katch dat bad Jim Jonson puttin' dat puter qua'ter in de sasser lass week. Fourthly, De darkies like to kotch dese fellers an' make cat-soup ob dem, an' dey set all kines ob snares an' traps for dem, jis like de fair sex offen sets for your suspected speeker; but I's de more kute an' kunnin' den de rabbet, kase I aint to be kotched dat way. I hear a good nanagote once 'bout a ole darkey an'! de rabbet, an' aldo you mought hab hurd it afore, I will tell it agin, in pint ob illustrashun. It 'pear from de records, dat ole Jersey Simon set' a trap an' kotched a rabbet, wich tickled him almoss to deff. It was a fine, fat buck, as wild and sassey as he cood 'tick. "Oh!" said Simoni, "you'm a good fat feller, an' I'll hab you stuff'd, an' make a roast pig ob you, sure. No, I won't nedder; I gess I fry yot like de sassengers, bein' as de fat in you will fry you. Now I cum to tink 'bout it, as you .am so mity fat, I tink you go best bril'd.'" All de wile Simon was 'dressin' dis interestin' talk to de rabbet, he was a smoobin' him down an' feelin' him all ober, an' he grin like monkey wid a hot chesnut, an' in de hite ob his delite he undertake to toe an' heel a Ifttle bit, an' de rabbet make a spring an' run away. Simon look arter him wid he lower lip almoss on lie bress, an' when lie see he was clear gone for sartin, he sing out to him, "Well, clar out; I don't kar.; you warn't so alwnity fat, arter all, an' jis like as not you ole an' tuff."    "ONG EARS.  ,        67 Fifthly, Ef all mankine war to look on missfortune as dat poor ole darkey did, de lunatick assilum wood hab to shut up shop ai' luff de keepers take a holiday.  Sixthly, De rabbet's nose am made ob sumfin like ingin- rubber, for it keep a norin all de time, as ef he smelt sumfin bad. I hab seen men an' wimmin keep dar nose turned up all'de time, as ef de tings on dis earth warn't good 'nuff for 'em, but dey'll fine tings 'nuff in de nex world dat will turn up dar nose like a corkskrew. Sevelithly, De rabbets. use dar noses for burrowin' in de groun', war dey bild dar houses six stores deep, an' I under- stan' from noein' ones dat ober twenty tousand ob dem was 'gaged by de abolishonest, when de undergroun' railrode was bilt, on wich dey run de runaway darkies from de Souff to Kanada. Eighthly, I shood like to noe wat's de reeson I war not ' 'wited to deliber one ob de peepil's lecturs at de Tubernickel, 'long wid de rest ob de professors. Brudder Greeley an' Brudder Beecher hab boff lectur'd, an' dey neber ax'd me a tall; an' har I hab been lecturin' to de peeple for de lass year an' a haff, an' I'll bet a hunderd clams dat I spoke to fifty times as menny folks as edder one ob dem. I tink de slite an' consult offer'd to your shepperd shood be 'sented by my congregashun, an' call Greeley an' Beecher to account. Dey got a shillin' a bed from all dat cum into de show, an' bar I hab to 'pend on tin shillin's an' bad pennies for support.' An' den jis look at de nonsense an' stuff dey git ober for a shillin a hbed an' look at de siance, larnin', resarch, an' solid chunks ob wisdom displayed in my diskorses for tree sents. It must be looked into, as Anty Clawson sed 'bout de bad clam. Will Simon Augustus Arlington Batts please p tuck in he raffle shirt, an' pass roun' de sasser? i,    .            . ,    68     ^    BIACK DIAMONDS. LECTURE XX.

An' darfore I shall distress you on dat pint dis ebenin'. De State ob Matrimoney am konsidered by sum de happi- est State in de Union, an' by odders it am tort de wisee . wersey.

Dar ugd to be a old kullerd man, named Dobso',.-d..i:: . willage, who used to foller de doctorin' traid.

He used to make a kine ob llam soup out ob de gumumphy oot, hang dangling berries, alexcompain, kanke largrer, land tkurlle and blue ruin, wid which he kured eberybody ob ing, darfor he was kalled Dr. Dobson. I-de' doctor used to kum to de seller to see Anty '-:.son, an' 'scuss siance wid me, an' drink root beer, an' eat penny pies an' clam soup. Darfore, he cum 'quainted Wid me.- 'Well, to cut a long tail short, as de man sed, whenl h'e Curtail-ed a dog, de doctor cum dar one nite all dressed ip, like fourth ob July, an' ax me how I like to marry a cappel dat ebenin'. I told him "putty well," any- ting for a 'onest libin', anL axed him 'who do peepil war? He -sed he was de subjick, and de lady was out on de corner, trimblin' like a stuck pig. I told him to go foch her in, an' off he went. In 'bout haff a nour back he cum wid a yaller lady 'bout haff he size, who blushed as much as sarcum- stances wood admit,. an' I stood dem one on one side ob de stobe, an' de bodder on de odder; an' I axed dem ef dey waO willin' 'to yoke togedder forlife, an' also likewise, e -f'I ' ebber had bin marred afore. De lady sed she had, but war so long ago dat she forgot all 'bout it. I ax her whoi- her husband was, an' she sed he had gone- ded five year-^: prebious afore.  "What-h die wid?"I axed. "De hos'itel, sar," she sed. "You mein he died in de hospital; but what was de matter. wid his complaint? What killed him?" "Oh l-'de skarlet shingles, I b'liebe," sed she. Dey gib hint doctorum stuff, an' he swell up and died." "Was he under de homneeinpackets, de allempackets, de doctor, or was lhe kured wid de root anryarbs?" tor Dobson, tryin' to fine out de siance ob de kase.   '0         BLACK DIAMONDS.

As soon as de sirahmoney was ober, de bride rushed out ob de dore like a young deer, an' luff de bridegroom to foller arter alonei De doctor laffed conclusively, an' observed dat de husban"shood allers luff de bride, ab her own way de fuss day, asn' den he gub me a haff a dollar, an' sed dat war all hek'kodol do for me dat nite; but ag dey war gwane to take a weddin' tower to Coney I'land, I mou't 'speck a bushel ob clams by de ; steem bote. Well, 'way he went, an' I nebber har noffin ob him, nor de clams too, till 'bout a munth arter dat I war a settin' in my sankto skunktoram in de seller, when in rushed Doctor Dobson wid he eyes big as sassers, an' he hare standin' like i; de syrup ob squills on de frifeful porkempine, an' almoss :  breffess he sed,  "Perfesor, I cum for de deworse.

N  !ED SINNERS: ^: NTo noe dyself am one ob de fast and most 'portant aws ob de State ob 'Merica, derefore I shall dis ebenin lucidate on de poplar subjick ob. X A-NATOIXY. Anatomy, my poor ignorant frens, am de bones, muzzles, wains and sinners ob de human body; agl eberybody am human body, colored man an Injin 'eluded. Am! I shall commence at de head ob de subjeck, and ascend- ingly go down to de foots, and splain tings as I go 'long. Fustly, den, I 'tack de brane, which lay on top ob de coco- nun in a pan furnished for de purpose, called de brane pan.  c -'   ANATTOMY. Dis lays alongside ob an odder pan called de tinpanum ob de ear, which am so called, from de fac dat it enables us to hear different kinds ob sounds ; dere am nudder pan in de human body, and dat's de neepan, and when all dese pans am shut de human body am ready to go off, specaly if de human body hab got a load on. We next come to de troat, which am made ob somefin like gutta percha, called lumfatix glands, which terminates at de borax, and runs into. de juglers wane. Some feller's troat am bigger den odder fellers, and dey drink more bad rum and eat more, which catastrofy am all owein to de size ob de swaller. De hart am de next. Dere am two parts ob de hart, and it works in de human, body jis like steam injine. It forces de blood to ebery part ob de ramification, eben to de hair, and dat am wat makes so many red heads. It lays rite under de lungs, whar de peeples hab de culenary consumshun; rite below dese -am sitewated de diagram, which am full ob holes, jis like 'a sibe. Dis ting am what keeps de stomack in its proper function, and allows de gastrick jewses to oberflow de jubebu::and .. fall into de pizaringtum, all ober de oilfactory neribesyand sometimes deranges de whole apparatus, and de hjn an body git sick, send for de doctor man, and funeral expenses  hab to be paid by de poor-house.         $   - Dere must be a biler in de human body somewar, kase I hear de doctors talk so much 'bout ,complaints betn' owin' to * de bile, and I'll find it out if I hab to go to de Anatomical A Museum to do it. De longest bone in de hole structure am X called de spine; dis runs horozontaly, dogmaticaly, and catolically long de back bone, as far up as de back-ob-de- neck-a-buss. Dis bone am full ob little jintes, and am de tenderest bone to fool wid, 'septin' de shin bone-in de whole sistem,   -I8     }   BLACK DIAMONDS. De action -ob de food will, in all probabiliemity, be mitey interestin' to you all; derefor I will close my discord by gibin' you a 'scription, ob de same. You see sister Mussy eatin' dat apple dar, and trowin' de skins on de floor. Well, dat apple pass fust true de lumf-at-ox glans' ob de troat, down de borax, to de diagram, into de stomjack; dere it am diegested into de gastrick juce, and passes into de jabams, tro' de anamal canal and kiuga akeduck, into de pizaringtum, and is dere lost among de infernal regions ob de corporation. Ah, my poor darkened hearers, dis am a subjeck dat few understand-; and I would hab been jis at stoopid as you all if I loafed round de warfs, and suck 'lasses from de barrels, like as I seed Pete Bolus adoin' lass week: Dis runnin' round de warf arter de sweets ob life will neber fill de tead wid useless knowledge I Brudder Bromfoozle will please hand round de sasser; I didn't git n'uff lass week to buy me backer wid, so shell out, dis time.

DARKENED DISCIPLES: YOUR worthy subscriber will 'lighten your bedimed wisionary organs dis ebening on one ob de moss 'fulgint sub- jicks dat man or woman kind eber listened to. I shall splanify de great siance ob ASS-TRONOMY. You must not spose, you hardened sinners, dat I is one ob dem gifted sight seers, or one ob dem wicked fortin tellers, kase I is guane to read de stars, for you noe dat ass- tronomy means de siance ob how to read de stars in de middle ob de nite time. Dere'am sebril kinds ob stars in de furmanend. Some. about de size ob de head ob a brass nale, an' dey grow larger till dey git as big as a soger's button. It am a most beaufull site, ob arcold nite, to stand out doors, raped up in notin but enthusiasm, an' gaze pon de starry sky, studded wid angel's eyes, all lookin down on you, to see what you am a doin on dis arth, and how you fool around de wimon. Dere am some comits (and some come-its too), wid long tales, which I shall 'lude to bom buy. De milkey way, which you no doubt hear a good deel 'bout, runs doo nort, west, and souf, clar from away down below de Battery, clar up to Orange county, and dat's de reason it am called de milkey way. Der am anudder kind /;* -     o .b railkey w dBLACK DIAMONDS. ob milkey whet dat I will sometime or odder splanify to you. De fust bright star dat was diskibbered was found out drue de aid ob a double-barrel'd skyglass, by a Jew ob de antshent times, named Peter, and was named arter him (Jewpeter) in a complimentary benefit at de time., De next was Mercury, but we only see dat shine on Sunday mornin in dis city; it am brite as de britest. Wenus am de star ob lub, and always shine britest in healthy warm climates. Mars am de star dat gides de soger man in de dark rode to glory, hallelujah, and E pluribus unum am anudder ob de same family. De nex planit dat I shall call to your notice, on dis 'por- tant 'casion, will be de moon. You hab, no doubt, all seen dis planit so often dat it needs no 'tickler description from your learned lecturer dis ebening. De moon is s'posed by meny ignumrent peeples to be made ob green cheese, but dat logick am 'roneous and false. Odders tink it am a big tin pan, hung out ob de inwissable "r,:winders ob hebin, wid a lamp hunl in frunt to make it shine, like de Dremmond lite on de top ob Mr. Barnum's Museum, and de reason dat we don't see it all de time am bekase it am taken in ebery now and den to get scowered, kase de nite air gits it rusty, and it must be cleaned. Sich stories am also a lie. Dere am no foolosefer dat hab diskibered zackly wat de moon am made ob, but de opinion of your 'litened laborer am dis. I look 'pon de moon as de little crystial palace, in which de god ob lub, little bare faced Cupid, libs, kase you all noe dat de moment a human critter falls in lab dey find de greatest delite in loafin about moonlite nites, and gazing on de beufill orb, wid de most intense anxiety, as if dey 'spected to find out somefin dereby condusive to dere happyness Sometimes dese peoples am   ASTRONOMY.         ^  i called moon struck. De moon struck me one nite as bein berry brite and hansome, but it 'fected Sister Hufferman bery different. She was comin home late from a ball in de moonlite wid de yung cullored man she danced wid last,-and it am s'posed she must hab fell in lub wid him, aldo she complained ob feelin' bad rite arter supper. Some ob de gossips dere sez she ete more den haff of a 'possum dat was serbed up on dis tickler 'casion. Well, as dey were walkin' 'long home she fainted in de cullored man's arms, gis as dey got to de corner ob de alley dat she honored wid her resi- dence. Dis skared de young he feller, and he dragged her in de house, roused all de family, laid her on de flop, sent a half-a-dozen arter as menny docktors, an' den rushed for one heseff. Dey all got back wid de different doctors at about one time, and now de berry debil was to pay; kase not one would 'scribe for her till all de rest was turned away, and at last dey got in a row. De Alopatist said she must be bleed in both arms, leeched wid forty-two leaches in de back ob de neck, and a blister ob Spanish flyes must be put on all ober de abominable regions ob de stumjack, and twelve grains  ob calomal ebery hour. De Homopatist said dat she a'e woulden't lib under de operation, and dat all she had to do was take as much ob a little powder dat he hab in he pocket-book as dey could put on de pint ob- a needle, an trow it in a sist'rn ob rain water, an' take two drop ebery odder Monday nite, at haff-past ten presisely, an' let her hab a smell ob camfor ebery few days in de- interum (I 'spect de interum means de nose). Dis made de water-cure doctor mad. He wished to noe wat rite de homapatist hab to order a sist'rn ob rain water under enny sarcumstances? De rite todat, he said, was his only. He went on to advise de pashent to hab a rope tied to her heels, an' be sowsed in de sistren sebral times a day, on an empty stumjack, den 4*   82         BLACK DIAMONDS. take a refreshin' shower-bath ebery twenty minits; an' he told dem how to fix up de shower-bath, by settin' de pashunt on de front stoop, an' pourin' a barrel ob cold water on her head, from de third storey windoes. De Tompsonin doctor said all de woman wanted was two or tree good emitics, an' a hot steem-bath, a hundred an' eighty-seben 'grees above alonzo; an' he told dem neber to send for a Tompsonian doctor till dey put de biler on fust. So de whole ob dem got a-jawiul true one anodder, an' in de middel ob de muss, de yung womon come two, an' was as mad as blazes to see sich crowd round her, and she clar'd de house in a little less den no time, an' de doctors arterinsultin' each odder togedder, come to de 'clusion dat Sister Hofferman must bab been moon struck, an' notin' else. Ah! my fren's, dis big round moon plays de debel wid weakly-headed people, sometimes. Will Brudder Thomas Benton Squash please pass round de sasser.   ABOUT THE MOSKEETO KINGDOM. LECTURE    rXTV. ABOUT THE MUSKEETO KINGDOM. MY DEAR WOOLLY HEADS; MY lectur dis ebenin will be on de Manners an' de Fashions, de Costumes an National Character ob de Oderifer- ous Country, known on de geolomical maps ob de arth as de MUSKEETO KINGDOM. Dis kingdom am siterwated away down souff, below war Dickson's line ob stages run to. It am way down de Mis- sippee, in de logatude 383 97, laffertude 9, under de tem- perance fluid zone. De best way to get dere am to take a canal boat from har to Buffalo, on to de Hio, den to Chiugo Lake, to Panamrass; from dere you go to Ismarass, on to Shagemrass; den you get on a jackemass, and ride into de Calafernia regions, git into a Chinese chunk, and go on to de Gipsin Pyrimids, take a one-hoss wagon ober de plank rode to de side ob de harbor ob de Moskeeter Kingdom; den you git on board de ferry boat,-and cross rite ober into de place, and dere you am, high and dry, like an' Irishman biles his potatoes. When you ribe dere you will find de park full ob omni- busses to take you to de king's palace, de high bridge, and odder poor-houses. De king ob dis kingdom am a he colored man, and a mitey big one at dat. He stands ten foot six, or six foot ten, I forgit now wich; but him a  mity great soger man. His   84         BLACK DIAMOINDS. unicorn consists ob a second-hand-me-down British ossifer's blood red soger coat, a pair ob spurs, and a tall bear-skin cap, wid a red and white fedder, a yard aseben inches and-a-half long, and a pair ob moust4choes. im 'seedinly  popular jis now 'mong his 'stituents,jkase-he lately sent out his whole army ob eight colored sogers, and tuck up all de ole wimons, and poor deluded crippels, who had 'barked in de peanut line; and den he had de wiskers of de dandies cut off, kase dey stuck out an inch or two beyond de mark laid down in de proceedin's ob de common scoundrels, and odder laws 'fectin' siety. De war on de peanut stands pleased de big bugs, an' de war on de wiskers pleased de poor poperla- tio   hence his great popelarity. Principal wegetation ob de island am 'skeeters, and dats de reason it am called 'Skeeter kingdom. Dese critters grow to about de size ob our chicken hawks, and dey lib in bee-hibes, and ebey hibe hab got a grindstone 'tached to it, where de 'Skeeters sharpen dere bills when dey hear ob de ribal ob a furener in de Selestial Empire.  De Skeeters am berry tick at all times here. De natives hab to carry a tin horn wid dem to blow dem away, so dey can see when it am dinner time. De people lib principally on sider spirits, skunk's cabbage, and jerked beef. I never  seed any jerked beef but once, and dat was a shin ob beef Sam Cuggo jerked off, a butcher stall in Cofarine Market, tudder Saturday nite. De papers say dat de manners ob de people am decidedly gross, derefore I tink a man ob genis, like Cap'n Coggy, would do well dere, if he upset a gross-ery. When yow git in dis kingdom you can hab jis as many wives as you can afford to keep, and you needn't advertise for a bordin house, widout reference, to lib in, kase any hut takes in lodgers, but dere am bery few sleepers found in eny   THE BUCK.          85 ob dese houses.

But England habin notin else for her navy to do jis now, am sending wes- sels dere to scrape acquaintance wid de 'Skeeter king, and see how de land lays. De compliments dat pass between de British orsifers and his 'lustrus highness am 'nuff to sicken all porkdom. I understand dat a committee ob de hole colored folks ob dis city am pinted to send his 'lustrious highness a inwitation to cum. on here and wisit de soup house, and odder public substitutions. I 'spect to be on hand on dat 'portant 'casion, and I now send Brudder Bose around wid de sasser, hoping to raise 'ficient money to lay in a five dollar suit in time. LECTURE XXV. DE BUCK. FELLOW TRABLERS TREW DIS WHALE OB TEARS: I SHALL draw my discord dis ebenin from de works ob Mr. Goldsmif on de wild beasteses, and shall debber to liten your intellect on de life, character, and occupation ob DE BUCK. You must noe dat dere, am sebral kinds ob bucks--de buck rabbit, de buck soger, de buck goat, de buck tom cat, de buck ram; dere am two kind ob buck rams i--one am de sheep, and de oder am found ginerally mong de tail- ors, for dese people use him to make de coat collars stiff;   86         BLACK DIAMONDS. den dere am de de man buck dat you see swelling down Broadway, buried betuene two yards ob shirt collar; den \dere's de buck nigger wot swells out on Sunday arternoons in he master's clothes, when he master happen to be out ob town; but I don't mean any ob dese fellers, kase dey got no character or occupashun wort speakin bout. You must not mistake de buck man for de buck goat, aldo dey look berry much alike about de face, kase dey boff got mitey long beards. You will noe de buck man by he's alers habing a segar in he mouth, de smoke ob which he puffs in people's faces as dey pass him in de treet. He differ from de buck goat in an nodder spect too, kase de ithes dat de buck goat wear he come honestly by, while de clothes ob de odder anamal de tailor often suffer- for, kase he gets cheated out ob de same; but I aint lecturin on de buck de tailors made, but on de buck de Lord ob human nature made in de year 1, and sent him in de woods to be de companion and husband to de doe. De buck, my ignorant hearers, am bout de size ob a yearling heffer, only much more beautifuller made at all pints. His feet differs immediately from de cullured man's in size and shape, dey being small for dere size and round for der formation. His skin, which pm sleek, and shines like a puter dollar in a swill tub, am bout de culler ob a grizly, gray, brown rat, and is mity nice, soft, and silky to feel ob, but dey wont let you feel em much, less you catch em fast asleep in de middle ob de day time. De buck may be classed, if he was fit to go to school, between de bull andd de race horse, for he can beat all creashun on a long run, which smack ob de race horse, and dat make him a bulley on' de track, and hence resem- bles de bull. He am de only animal dat has beat de   THE BUCK.  telegraph to any great extent. De inguns use him for carrying de males from one wigwam to de odder, same as we use de steam loferfotive for de same purpose. Mr. Ingun, as he jump 'pon his back, cotches hold ob his horns, and stears him strait true de woods, and like Brandeth Pills, dey. find dere way out in a short time. He head am de most beautifull part ob he countenance, if he'd only keep his nose clean. He hab horns on he head, which begin to grow bout de third month arter marriage wid Miss Doe, and de older he grow de biggar dey git, until dey git as long as a dull leader in de noosepapers. Dis kritter, you all know, you ungratefull scamps, am de wensen dat you hear 'bout, and sometimes smell whe-:you go past de fashionable eatin' houses I De hind quarters am considered de best part, but "dareby hangs a tail," as de 'posel Shakespere said 'bout de play-house. Wensen, my friends, am deer meat ; it am worth 20c. a pound, and when it am fried in a fryin' pan, it looks for all de world jis like slices ob Ingun rubber biled down in molasses, and smells like de same, specially in dog days time. De occupation ob de buck am like odder people's, who hab to pick up a libin as dey go along trew life, and his character stands A No. 1 among de sportin' gentry; for we often'hear ob dese gemmen riding all day gis to get in company mid one ob em ; he am, in fact, much sort arter; but, like a Subbern nigger, he don't 'pear to return dere affections in de least, for he no sooner hears or sees dem arter him, den he sticks him nose rite strate afore him, and trowin' his horn on he back, lifts up he tail, and shows his agility in a most surprising manner. When de gents find dat he don't want to suasheate wid dem, dey generally send a bullet-due arter him, on de reception ob which he merely stops, and allows heseff to be conducted to whereber    g8      v  BLACK DIAMONDS. dey wish to take him. Dis, my friends, is all I can find out 'bout de buck. It's a skittish subjeck, and I tink you ort to be mighty proud ob your suspected lecturer dis elening. Brudder Wose will please pass round de sasser, and look out for de California lumps. LECTURE XXVI. DEEP REFLECTIONS.

Fust, I blebe in laffin, kase it eases de conshunce, aids digestion, and laxitudes de muzzle ob de face.   90         BLACK DIAMONDS. Secondly, I don't blebe in cryin', kase it am a fringement on de water laws ob de human body, makes a feller rinkel up he countenance in an orful manner, an' siles de pocket hankershings. Thirdly, I'm principald aginst gittin up int de mornin' afore de bell ringrs for brexfust, alway perwidin I got a brexfuss to git up to, an' I tink it best not to quit de table as long as dar am anyting to eat. Fourthly, I'm too tinder harted to see a feller cretur suffer fisic:Ll or povertical sufferin', an' darfor when Hmeet enybody in distress, I git out ob dar way as soon as possa- ble. De Almanac sez dat's benebolence, an' I speck it am. Fifthly, I nebber tiuk it worf while to mind my own bizness, as long- as I can find enybody's else's dat I tink ort- to be quired into. Else, how in natur wood I find out de chunks ob siance. Sixthly, I belebe dat as long as a man can pay he dets, he am a good feller, ail' when he can't- he am a scounderl. Dat's de way de world go, an' ob corse I go wid it. Seventhly, I neber swasheate wid de wite trash no how, an nebber dine out, ef dejfamely don't hab clam soup for edder de dinner or de puddin.

Darfor I will tell you a annygote to probe to you dat my pinion am founderd on a chunk 6b wisdom as hard an' as big as de rock ob Gibit's Altar. De story am 'bout an ole cullard man, an' he noein' dog. You see dar war a black man in Ole Warginia, named Tone, dat owned de humblest dog de eye ob man or beest ebber beheld. He war so- humbley dat he coodn't shut he eyes widout hurtin' he countenance an' what war a little curious 'bout dis dog war de fack dat he messured from de tip ob he tail to de cold spot on he nose, jis as much as he mes- sured from de cold spot on he nose to de tip ob he tail. Dis singelarity, ob corse, make him a great curiosity .town meetin' days. But dis didn't make a " dif a bitterence " to de owner, who' lubed him jis as much as ef he war ob a kuller node in de wokabulary ob tints, an war as well shaped as enny odder common dog. Well, ole Tone war offin seen a trainin' he dog in de woods alone by heseff, an' %  eberybody got to noe dat he war a great dog. One day a berry rich sportin' gemman who happend to hear oAb de dog, sent a rambassader to ax de price ob him, an ef he war a ?i,  good 'coon dog? !"Oh, yes, mastrum, I got de dog you waet. He'm a fuss-rate 'coon dog, an' he sute de gemman all ober," sed ole Tone. "How much do you want for him?" axed de rambassader. "Well, I ort to git ten dollars for dat dog, kase he mus' be one ob de bes' 'coon dogs in de hole naborhood."  De bargin war struck, an ole Tone war so mity pleesed dat he laffed 'way down in he boots. De gemman took de  dog an' left, an' in less dan an hour Tone war drunk at de tabern, an' bragin to eberybody 'bout de price he git for de anaril. Well, time don't stop in Ole Warginia no more   DOGMATIC.          93  den hear, an' it roll'd on for 'bout a week, when de rambas- sader come back wid de dog, as mad as blazes; an' on meetin' Tone he grab him by de koller, an sed- "! Look here, you 'furnal, cheatin', black raskal, you sold me dis son ob a cur for a fuss-rate 'coon dog." "Well, ain't he?" 'quired Tone, "by Ginger, I tort he. war." "You tort he war. You told me he war, an' I have been out two days wid him, an' de moment he sees a coon he runs- v away frommhim. Now, what cood make you rink he war good at huntin" coons?" "Well, now, look a here, mastrum. Don't be so mitey mad.;an' I'll tell you wat made me tink he war good for huntin' de 'coon. I read in de almanack dat eberyting am made fur sum purpose, an' I bin a-tryin' dat dog at ebery- ting under hebbin, 'ceptin' 'coon huntin' an' he warn't worf a ledder button at all I tried him on, and so I tort dat he must be good at dat, as he warn't at nuffin else, an' I 'eluded dat he war manerfactered on purpose for it." Well, my frens, don't dat sassagefry you dat I'm rite? Now I ax, in de name ob all dat's sweet, what was dat dog good for? Nufin!

Eber since de ole anty delugian world xisted-,an I can bring de Almanac an de Esyklopeedia ob Human Natur to probe my sershun--de kuller'd man hab bin none as de moss gay deceber. From de. time dat Jane An ob Ark left de   100        BLACK, DIAMONDS. Ark on Mount Haireat, dressed up in a coat ob mail soger cloffs, an claimed relashunship to Napolion Bonypart, de uncle ob his ill-begotten nefew, to dis day, no one hab bin so fool hardy as to dout for one minute de deseptial facul- tees ob de darkey. As I hab here qluded to Jane Ann ob de Ark, I s'pose some ob you wood like to noe little 'bout her;- darfor, I will transgress from de subjick under de ham- mer, an tell you dat Jane Ann ob Ark war a soger woman, an went into de discontented field, and slew more men dan all de bed bugs dis hole congregashun hab killed during de lass two weeks. She war a fitein woman ob de rashest kind, an used to ride on a white hoss, clad in de moss bril- liant armor dat war eber maid. History sez dat her armor war made ob steel an brass scales, an war moss elefent to behold; but it allers kinked my wool. to see how her armor cood be so brilliant, an yet look so scaley as to be ment- shuned in print. I neber found out zackly what made de peepil call her "Jane Ann ob Ark," bekase history don't say dat she came ober in de Ark a tall. But I count for it in dis way. It am well none mong de stugents ob sience dat all de anamiles dat entered de Ark went aboord in pares; but dar neber war two such sheroines as Jane Ann ob Ark. Har mate coodn't be found, so dey luff her go on har own hook; and when she leff de bote, de peepil in de Ark hab to gub her dat nickname. She war a good soger, but her whitewashun an stockin darnin wasn't much to brag bout; brt to my diskibbery. You all recumlect dat in de X lass procklamashun ob Gubner Hunt, he serted as a fack/ dat de culleird race war a dwindlin' away, an in a few years wood be xtink. An dar war a public meetin held by de cul- ler'd folks in dis city; wharat he war call'd a jackass for sayin so. It brot out a poem from me dat will be remem- bered by ebery man, woman an child till dey forgit it.   JOAN D' ARC.

De last sclimax ob all your wisdom was de passage ob de Maine Licker Law, dat perwents a man to drink a glass ob  somfin to take wid anudder huaian bein. Har's de way de ting stan's. Two men says to one man, "We don't like licker, no how-darfore you shant have it." "But," says de man.' "I hab bin brought up to take a nip casionly, an I can't bery well do widout it, an I see no reason dat I can't hab it, jis case yobu two fellers don't like it. I toucght you boasted ob dis bein' a free country, and dat eberybody cood do as dere conshunce dictates ; wat de debil am your 4t ob July for, ef you act in sich tiranical ways?" "But, my fren," sez de two men, "dere am a drunkin lofer round de corner dat wont take cur ob he family, and we, de peqpil, hab to take cur ob dem. Now if we luff you drink, we nmust.. luff him drink too, and you see it wont do."  ":But," sez de one man, "aint dere a law to punish dat drunken lofer if he kicks up a muss and wont take cur ob he family?" "Ah, yes, dere am, I beliebe," sez de two men. "Well, den, why must I be punished for de sins ob dat lofer round de corner?" sez-de one man. "Becase we consider \it best, and we will hab it so." And so you go on in your stubborn-headed way till putty soon you will stop de chawin ob tobacker, and dat   "O        BLACK DIAMONDS. will cause a raise in de gutta persha market-houseC-kase dey muss chaw sormfin. Den all Boston will be a gutta persha factory. De snuff takers will hab to take to usein cubeb's, kase de snuff will be stopped soon--and den- you will make ezberybody go to one church, de one youe like, and corn- pell dem to go sebril times on a Sunday, and twice a Sunday nite, and take up a kollection ebery time dey go. You will make eberybody go up on one side ob de street and come down on de todder; pass a law to show at which door a geni shall enter he house aud he carrage-and as you hab legislated what he shall drink, I speck soon you will lay out he eatables for each week, and ef he calls in enny extras, fine him, a-ad spend de fine in abolishun tracts. Dere am one claus in dat licker law dat shows de Yankee bio as dat Elemfent dat I told you 'bout tudder nite-and dat am de fack, dat you will luff de distillerys continue to makd rum to sell out ob de State; but it cant be sold in de - State, kase it am pizen, but you sell de pizen to your nabors. Now aint you a putty set-jis look at youseff inside and out, politically and religiously, and see ef yon hadent ort a git a second pistol from me.

MY DEAR CONSTICHEWENTS:  I FIND dat some ob de wite trash ob New York got de mullygrubs, an went off in a coniption fit ob de sulks, at sum stringent marks dat I choose to make on my own plat- form lass week bout Cowshute an de New York regement. But what do I car for de wite trash? or what do' de wite trash car bout me? Dat's de questshun. Sum ob de wite trash pertend to car a good deel bout de culler'd man, but it am all gas an politicks, got up jis to kick up a muss an keep de kedentry at a bilin pint ob xcitement by de Balti- more Conwentshuns. Dese Baltimore Conwentshuns. am gittin to be a great. nuisance in dis kedentry. You neber hear, ob dem in England, an I don't see no use in dem. De oney good ting dey hab done is to nominate Brudder Pierce for de Presidency. Brudder Pierce hab long held a specta- ble sitewashun in Brudder E. P. (dat means E Pluribus) Christy's band ob minstrels, an he kin play de tamborine to kingdom cum. He am a fuss rate feller, an I long ago pro- fitized dat he talents wouldc be diskibbered by one or odder ob de great parties ob de day. When he git to de White House, we'll hab high ole times. De fuss ting he will do am to call Brudder Bones (darfore you will make no bones in supportin him) an' Brudder Jonson in de cabinet shop to look arter de keys ob de burow, an see ef de decanters am allers full on de sideborde. Dan'l Webster hab to clar out-   DARREIES IN- THE WHTE HOUSE.    115 den, kase he will collect de wisdom ob de nashun round him, an den I will be called pon.

When I git to be Prime Minister, I'll hab stated preechin ebery odder nite in de Wite House. Two nites in de week de band will perform in de big hall, led by Pierce heseff, an nobody else, kase Perfessor Jonson, de leeder at dis time, can't speck to shine den, no matter how big his whiskers, or how highl falutin he combs his hair. De two odder nites we'll hab a break down, when all de furrin Rambassenders will be lowed to cam, hair an all, an jine in de real. Oh, my frens, we'll all hab hallumlujah day den, an clam soup de year roun. No man, not eben Bill Seweed or Fred Douglass, will be pinted to orfice, onless he can pat juba, sing "Git out ob de way Ole Dan Webster, or Tucker "-don't make a dif a biterence which-an can dance a break down.  Den dar will be some swellin up an down de lemenade on PencilHania abenue, an Kolole water will be riz. Darfor, I say, go you deff on Pierce. He's a man arter my own pocket, an I'll bet a cart lode ob Cowhay clams dat he'll be leckted. Jis luff de wite folks hear him make de tamborine ring, an den keep him out ob de cheer ef dey can. What's dat Brudder Ben Lomans sez? I got de rong pig by de ear? How can dat be, when it am in eberybody's mouffdat Pierce am nomenated? An don't all de noose- papers say so too? An did eber one ob dem lie? Say? Oh I it am General Pierse, ob New Hamshere, dat's nom- enated, am it? Well, by golly, I tort it war Brudder Pierce, de tamborine man.

INDEPENDENCE DAY; REBELIOUS SINNERS: OLD Brudder Samuil Nuckils, who, you noe, was a haff brudder to ole Joxth Heath on he mudder's side, and is now too old to do ennyting but eat spoon witals and sleep, wants me to say somfin 'bout Independence and Fort ob July, and as I was doun dere to his house, and spent de Fort-which cum on de Fif dis year-I tort I may as well say somfin 'bout him, as well as odder pepil. You ob corse all noe who ole Fort ob July am, and why de fokes kick up sich a muss at de return ob ebery birth day. Ef ye don't, den I'll tell you. Fort ob July was born in Filemundelfy in 1776. General George Washington was he gran' dadder, and Thomas Jef- ferson was he farder. He had fifty-six god dadders dat attended his birth, and hear let me say dis fifty-six hab bin consider'd de weightiest fifty-six dat de world ebber seed; kase all Urope cuddent lift or disturb dem. England had de ropes all reddy to lift dem by dere necks, but she found dem too heavy to fool wid. De birt ob Fort ob July was hail'd wid de ringin ob bells and de firin ob cannon, and so has he birt-day ebber since. De wost ob it am, it'always will cum in de summer time. As far back as I kin recolem- lect I hab 'notic'd dis fac, and put it doun in my scratch book, for furter futurety, Comin in sich hot wedder as it does, de pepil get de fantods afore it am obber. I don't say   "8        BLACK DIAMONDS. dat dey all git de fantods, but I noticed a great many who had fans and a great many who had tods,.which blended in one pusson, products de fantods. De Irish pepil boast dat St. Patrick was jis as good a man as Fort ob July is; kase Pat banish'd a few toads and alegators- from a little island todder side ob Jorden. But Fort ob July dun more den dat-he lickd a whole army ob sarpints and crockemdiles dat cum obber hear, armed to de teef in soger clothes. Derfore, if you here a bogtroter make any sich f'usions, de best -ting you kin do am to gib him one on he nose for heseff. Fashenable pepil all go out ob town on de Fort, and lebe de city in de hands ob de poor classes. Derfore, 'cordingly I went out ob town myseff lass Monday, and I got myseff into much tribulation and disgust dereby. I will tell you how it cum. You all noe berry well dat for a few monfs prebious, your wordy speeker hab formed great 'tachment to Bettsy Gemima, de gran'dorter ob ole Samn Nuckels, dat lib down to Hogrshead Long Iland. Well, de Saturday afore de Fort I pack'd up my portmantila in de croun ob my hat, and puttin what small change I hab in my cloze in to one west ppckit, I put on my specks an ruffel shirt an sallied forf to de cars. When I got in de cars de peepil all star' at me like as if I wos one ob de candydates for de Presumcy. Ebberybody node me, and 1' how d'ye do, Professor?" met my refulgent gaze at ebbery turn.    - Well I ribed down dor, and Bettsy Gemima iecibed me' in a most blushin' and expirin manner. De ole man sed he was glad to see me, Aldo he had bin blind dese twenty years. He ole woman, ober a hundred years ole, was dere lookin' like a dried ingin rubber foot ball stuck in a nite cap. As soon as she seed me, she axed me if I cum down dere on a marrying expedishun, and made Bettsy Gemirna look forty   INDBETNDENCE DAY.        119 ways for Sunday, wid shame and difushun. I sed I was a moss to ole I feer'd for dat, and I axed her how ole a pus- son muss git afore dey gib up all desire to marry. She sed I muss ax somebody older dan her, and dat make Bettsy Gemima laff all ober her face. Putty soon arter dis, Bettsy Gemima leff de room to open some clams for to make de clam soup, and while she. was gone an idear struck me which kinder startled me, as I aint use to bein' struck wid dem. I tort as bein' as how Bettsy Gemima was a gwane to make de clam soup for my speshal stomjack, dat I 'ort to do somfin for her a little nice and pritty. I recomleckted dat I seed a skruce beer sine on de door ob a little shop, near unto de car whar de depot cum in, and I made up my mind to slip off and git a qwart  unbenonin to nobody and s'prise Bettsy Gemima wid de same, when de clam soup war reddy.           -: ' But what was I to fetch it in? As dis question was a tumblin all true my hair, like a mouse in a bale ob okum, I seed a ole brown pitcher settin on de top shelf ob de dres- ser, and in a minit I had it in my hand and was on my way to de skruee beer shop. I tole dem to put a qwart in dere as quick as litenin, kase I was in a mity hurry. In a few minits I had de beer, and ribed at de house jis timeniuff to set it up in its ushal place, afore Bettsy Gemima cam in wid de clams all open'd in a pan. I didn't say nofin, but my hart kept a  bee tin quicker and faster at de tort ob de s'prise dat waited for de gall ob my  'fections. Well pretty soon de soup was dun, and de ole fokes and Bettsy Gemima and me myseff sot down to de table, when I spoke out and told dem I bro't somfin down from de depot dat wood gladden dere harts, and I rose and went to de dresser and hainded my belubed de pitcher. She blush'd and took it, but as' I sat down to de table agin, I tort she look a little mad, and   120         BLACK DIAMONDS, I was fritened when she axed me if I specked dem to drink sich stuff ; but I answer'd and sed, '"In corse I do, kase I got it spressly to tickle your palate!" Den I seed she was rale mad, and she sed no man shouldent tickel nofin 'bout her, and I cood take it all myseff. Wid dis she flung it rite in my ruffle boosum, and it went all ober dem new trowser- loons Anty Clawson made me out ob de ole bedtick. I de- manded to noe de reeson ob sich treatment, and Gemima, sinkin' in a chare, busted out a cryin', and sed I'd find her reasons in de bottom ob de pitcher. I den, for de fuss time, look'd in de pitcher, and dere I found her reasons in de shape ob a ded mouse, 'bout haff discomposd, a stump ob segar, a piece ob taller candle 'bout tree inches -long, sum corn sabe, a gimlet, a shoe string, and some pills fur to kill ratsl I hab herd ob fellers afore now feelin' streeked, but I felt nasty, and megitly leff de house, took de fuss depot dat leff, and cum back home to foolosofize on de succeedin' ewents as dey 'curred. De moral ob all dis am-Always look into tings afore you use dem-specially ole pitchers. I found out who put de lites out lass week, and I got a rod in pickil dat'll tickil when I use it. As I was fool'd out ob my colleckshun lass week, I speck a double dose ob small change dis ebening. ?,   :  HE ELEPHANT. -T LECTURE XXXVI. THE ELEPIANT.

At fuss I tort I'd bess diwide him in too parts, like de preecher mans do dar tex, an lectur on haff ob him at a time. But I didn't noe wich haff to commence onfuss, an I tink ef I :? tackle him wid de claws ob true siance, I will succeed in showin his different pints as finely aQS ebber Massa Barnum did in his life. De anamel luded to hab created a great sensashun in dis willage, an folks from all parts ob de country hab flooded de city to find an git a look at him, an singelar to relate, a great menny found him whar dey didn't spect to see :him, an whar he war sort for moss he war nebber dere. Some ob de city boys hab from time to time started on a huntin expedishun arter him, an dey ginerly found him by daylite in de stashun house, or some odder kind ob wicked house. From your snickerin I begin to tink you know who de gemman am dat I wish to induce tq you. Ef not, I will tell you .a t I[mean DE ELEMFENT. Dis obbergrown lump ob flesh muss hab bin made at de commencement ob de Beast makin. When dey had a obber pluss ob anamile matter on hand; an it seems to me dat hslahn natur, when he made him, doa it as a sperement to   122        BLACK DIAMONDS. see how big a feller he cood make walk, an how much flesh an bone dey could cram in one skin widout spoilin it; an sure nuff it warn't spiled a bit, but walked off one ob de noblest an moss noein ob all de beastesses. My ignumrent scorpians, as a great menny ob my hearers hab bin a long time tryin to see him widout doin de same, I tink a gineral scripshun ob his bigness will be relished by dose whose labor hab bin in wain. , Ef one ob dese fine mornins you shood see sumfin cumin up de treet, big as a hay stack on four warf spiles, wid a hed like a flour barrel wid a side ob sole ledder flappin on each side ob it, an a nose six foot long a squirmin around like de Ingine rubber hose, an feet dat look 'bout as grace- ful as a child does a walkin in two swill pails, an a couple ob teef stickin out ob he mouff like two- barber poles a stickin out ob a basement barber shop, dat's him-Ole John B Elemfent hissepf. When he walks he roles from side to side like a sailor man jis landed, an I speck de reeson am bekase his feet am berry tender from carryin round dis big haystack, an he's got corns on all he toes. He foot am shaped somfin like a culler'd man's, oney broader; but like de darkies, de holler ob it make a hole in de ground. When he war made, it: seems to me dat dey stood out four ob dem warf spiles, an piled on all de meat dey could pile qn. Den dey made a gravey ob sandstone, gutter per- sha, broun dust, molasses an gray dog, an pour'd it all ober' de flesh, an dar luff it dry. He war so big, an de big long ladders hadn't bin inwented yet, so dey coodn't smoff it doun much, an dat counts for he rough pearance 'all ober. Wen dey cum to de tail, de stuff gib out, an dey had to cut it Short; but unlike menny tales I hab seen, dar am a good an desided pint to it. :Ef dey had made it as long as he nose,   THE ELEPHANT.         123 it might hab puzzled him which end war to go fuss, kase he look as do he hab a tail at boff ends. He nose am call'd a trunk, but for what reeson no foolosofer hab found out, kase he nebber carry no close in'it; but de way he can pick up de apples, an nuts, an candies wid it, am nuff to breek a munkey's heart. He ort to belong to de Poke Nose S'iety, *kase I neber met wid a; feller dat had such a pensity to poke 'he nose in odder peepil's bizness in my life. One time, wen I war a seekin nolege in a carrywan tent ob wild beastes, I seed him stick he long Ingin-rubber nose into a lady's. satchel, an steel a hunk ob gingerbread, nuff for my supper, which he took in one bite, widout eben winkin or .pickin he teef. He jis roled he trunk down he mouff, which, like de culler'd man's, am sitewated in de lower part ob he bed, jis under he nose. Well, I tood dar a laffin at he imperence, wen he grab'd my cap off my hed, an widout chokin a bit, swaller'd it. Den I begin to laff on de odder side ob my mouff, kase I tort my new cap gone sure; but de keeper told me to coxe it out ob him wid apples an sugar tings. So I blied sum ob dem wid my lass sixpence, an gub it to him, an arter a while he put he nose down he troat, pull'd up de cap, an flung it haff way cross de show, widout eben smilin at de trick. He's got a orful swaller. I tink he cood take in a  barrel- ob taters, haffga dozen bed quilts, an a buffalo skin at one time, jis as easy as I kin swaller a Cow bay clam. A  great menny nannydotes am told ob dis feller's cunning- ness an trickery, dat wood keep you a laffin all nite; but I am warned by de woise ob Time to shut up. De elemfent am de moss segarshus an noein ob all de anamile creashun ; but den, who coodn't be smart wid a hole hogshed full ob branes. It's a  wonder to me dat a feller wid his high for- 8 hed, don't turn his tentshun to lecturin on de siances.   124        BLACK DIAMONDS.

MY DEAR WOOLEY HEADS: FOR de wancement ob siance on dis 'tickler casion I shall re-lie on de anamal kingdom for a subjeck to lectur on, and derefore I shall, by 'tickler request, proceed to anata- mize an old acquaintance ob you all-namely, DE HOG. De hog, my deluded wooley heads, am a native ob de Sixt Ward, aldo dey am frequently often found in odder inhabited disricts ob dis badly 'litened city, and np matter war he am found, he am de happiest ob beasteses all de wotld ober; he always feel perfectly at home anywar:and generally makes out to find a libin'; he am de happyest feller dat runs in de streets. Take him in his single or matrimonial state, dere am no anamal enjoys heseff better; in fact, de deeper he am in de mud de more he am in   THE HOG.          125 de mire ob contentment; he lays heseff down, straches heseff out, and gibs heseff up to glory.

Dis- lass obserwation am too true to laff at; for de big book says dat de debil was sent into de swine (swine am de Hebrewer's name for hog), and dat accounts for de deblish shines he sometimes indulges in, shaking he little tail, rollin' up he little eye, and smackin lie chops for joy. Dere am no use for me to describe de ypearance ob de hog to you, kase you am all " on de most intimate terms wid him," as de politishens always sez, when dey spoke 'bout de President. Dey am tought but little ob in siety, specialy by all pblytishens, kase dey can't wote. If dey could, de Sixt Ward would go hog ebery 'lection. -Dere am sebril kinds obi hogs:* dere am de W4il street hog, whose hogish appetite for money would make him steal de wool off ob a- dead darkey's head, to stuff he hair cushin ; den dere's de hog landlord, who would sell de bed from under a sick child redder dan lose a shiilin rent, if he could; den dere am de- hog boarder,- who nebber quits de table as long as dere am enrny ting left to eat, and when butter am dele't piles it on de tickest, and nebber -pays up he board. Ah, b y stingy hearers, dere am more hogs In dis world dan wat ruh around a gruntin' on four legs. De hog am a useful anamal; but, like all ,odder gen- uses, de world neber diskibers his great walue till arter he am dead, and served up, young and roasted, at a Yankee train dinner, or staked off in a sixpenny eatin' house, or turned into de sassage market, in company wid dog meat and red flannel. His life generally ends--when he don't   126        BLACK DIAMONDS. get run ober by de omnibusters-as a countryman's career in. city commences, viz.-by bein stuck. tl hog am a most anshent animal; he must hab libed long afore de flood, kase it will be remembered dat Gen. Geerge P. Noah took a Ham wid him into de ark ; and you know dere can't be no hams war dere am no hos. Hams were so plenty at one time in Garmany, and so bery big, dat de people made houses ob dem, and bilt up a hole town, which am called till dis day, in all de 'spectable arifmatics, Ham-burgh. But I am led by de nose to belebe dat dese hams spoken ob must bab bin wooden ones; and, no doubt, some ob de Yankee abolitionists' grandfarders took out a ship-load, and sold dem at a slight profit, and den stole a ship-load ob slaves from de coast ob Ginny, jis to save dem from any loss by de trip. You see I noe dese old Yankee fellers aroun' Nantucket. But I must close dis interestin' subjec, or else you may tink I am like a hog myseff for habin so much jaw.

De subjick dat I shall spoke 'bout on dis 'tickler 'casion Will be one dat shood kommand wide awake listeners, kafe I shall splanify some tings dat no foolosefer hab yet diskibered in dis ligtined country, and I spect to see my name em- blasteod on de m'ckutchon ob fame, and handed down to pos- terity by my antsisturs in preseedin' years to come in kon- sequence dereof. I shall once more 'xtract my diskushun from natral histree and de fust beast dat I shall 'tack will be  DE RINOSSINHOSS. Some folks mou't call it de rinossincow, kase it hab got a horn on him hed; but he am set down as rinossin/oss' in de Comic Almynack, and odder elemwated woi;ks on siance, and derefor I tink he am considerable ob a hossdnd  notin' ia ta!l to do wid de cow speeches.

My der ignumrent hearers, de rinossjnhoss am a anty phebious creter, jis like de crockemdile, and he libs more den haff de time in de water, and hence he am better off den de poorer class ob de wite and de cullered peeple in dis sitty, kase he can get a baff during de hot wedder free gratis for notin' wheneber hewants it, wicli shows 'clusibely to my mind dat provemdental natur takes better'care ob de beasts ob de feelds den de corporation takes ob de lower classes ob I 'siety. I gess I cut somebody's buttons den. One reason why he don't stay on land more'n he dose am kase he got eny quantity pb corns on he tose, which render he "long marches, dreadful measures," as de posel Shakespur sez. De corns on he toes am jis as hard as de horn on he nose,  lwhich make de larned Goldsmith, not de larned blacksmith, class him 'mong de horney anamals; and what makes it worse for him is de fack dat he don't no how to read de noosepapers, dere nebber habin bin no mishenary siety yet 'tablished to go mong-dem to upset free schools, to larn dem to read; else, dey could see at once what sab to use to kure dere korns.

It am somefin you am all seekin arter, but nebber fine; you offen tink you noe whar de little joker am, but you noe sooner put your finger on it, dan he arnent dar. Darfore I shall draw my discord on de subjick ob- HAPPYNESS. Happyness, my perspirin frens, am de ting dat all man- kine am arter, and human natur made man so different, de D  s    WHAT WE ALL WANT.       135 one from de odder, dat what am one man's happyness am anudder man's ratsbane; and so it am in de wegetable kingdom and Anong de insex. De clam am 'puted to be happy on a sand bank at high water, and a bee atsed to fine happyness in a tar barrel, but dat's not to say dat a cullored man would feel happy a rollin in a tar barrel on de beach at Coney Island. De young look for it in de marriage life, and de old look for it in de grabeyard, but I don't look for it in eder ob dese speres ob life. My ignorant hearers, I is, on dis berry 'portant 'casion, gwane to tell you what I consider constipates happiness. It am a clar coushence and a full stomach; not too full ob de latter, but de former may be as pure and clar as monshine. It am a glorious ting to hab a clar conschence so you can lay down at nite and tink dat you hab not injured nor ronged nobody all day. Den it am dat you can roll yourseff up in de sheet ob contentment and de blanket ob innosence, and sleep and snore in your wartuos beds wid all de sassegefac- shun ob a hog in a mud hole; and den in de mornin wen you wake up, you can walk forth in all your strength ob manhood (I don't mean smellin strength), and am not afeard to look you feller man plump in de face. Dat's de happyness I enjoy. But how different am it wid sum ob you fellers dat will steal chickens and sich tings I You lay down at nite wid your bed cubbered wid de bed-close for fear de policeman cotch you, and den all day you keep dog- gin 'round de'corners in dread and fear ob de same anamals. I recomlect many years ago how I felt arter I had stolen somefin; it was one nite when my fadder and my modder wus gone to bed, dat I cum home late from a huskin frolic dat ole master Wanramseller gib to de darkeys on de plan- tashun, and wen I lit de candle to go to bed, I foun a bas- kit ob clams dat fadder hab bin and cotched in de arter-   136        BLACK DIAMONDS. noon; well I sot down de candle and went at de clams and put 'em away mitey fass, till I eat 'em a, moss all up, and den I go to bed; but I cudn't sleep, I role and tumbled all nite like a empty barrel on de brinary osun ;'I tink wat de debil am de matter I kase I begin to fed suffin queer in de bread basket, when all at wonce I taut I bin eatin a moss a hundred stolen clams, and dey lay like a leaden anker on my conschence, and dey did hurt me like beeswax. My groans 'sturbe de ole woman; she ax me wat ails me, I told her, and she say it surbed me rite, and wood larn me not to meddle wid odder peepel's clams agin. I got skeard, and rushed out ob de house, model artist as I was, and run to Dr. Bunsby's. Dis doctor was an Alapackest, and he bled me at once, and den gib me a dose or two ob sirrup ob swill and ruebub, and by daylite I got ober it. It was a awful nite, and it lamed me de wallue of a clar conschence. My frens, if you wish to be happy in dis world, do all de good you can to de poor, speak kine to every body, ef it am only a dog. Don't decibe, and lie to your frens; put as much as you kan in de sasser every week, and don't eat raw clams to any 'xtent at bed time, wedder dey am stolen or not, and I tink you can stan a far chance not only ob bein happy in dis world, but you will occupy a snug place in Abraham's bosom, providin' he takes niggers in dat spacious apartment.                  n I is 'sprised to fine wun or two ob de sisters hab 'dopted de wulgar new Turkey trowsers and Ingin woman's straw hats, which Missus Bikery Sinith hab been lecturin on.

FELLOE DISCIPLES: I is sorry to hab to pear afore you in de shape ob an 'pology, but de fact am I hab bin so bizzy wid one ting and annudder sence I lass spoke to you, dat I had not hab time to fix up a lectur on any siantific subjeck. Sarcumstances hab followed sarcumstances in sich rapid suckseshun, jist like de cars on 'de railroad track, dat my mind hab bin 'tirely prostitute. De fust suckemstance dat affect me was de rible ob Massa Foolmpre, de presemdent ob dis mitey nation, kase you see I hab a little bizness wid him dat 'quire specific atten- tion. I called on him once at de wite house in Washing- ton; but- it happened to be wash day, and I found Mrs. Foolmore bizzy washin, and she was cros as blazes bekase I cotched her widout her Sunday dress on, so Massa Fool- more tipped me de wink, and he gib me sixpence to drink he helf wid, and tole me to call agin. I tanked him soderi- fously, and promised to do de same which he 'spress; but-   188        BLACK DIAMONDS.  my ardent bizness led me to git hack to de norf by de nex train. So I nebber call on Massa Foolmore arter dat, till he 'ribed hear lass Tuesday, when tinking it my duty, I went down to deIrwing House and ring de bell. A cullored man, behind a big pair ob mustachoes and a wite apron, opened de doe, and in a gruffy woise ax'd me " wat I wanted at dat doe," and "why I didn't go to de kitchen doe?"I laff at he imperence, and told him I was a friend ob de presemdent, and dat I wished to spoke wid him. "Don't belibe it," sed de dandy nigger, "but you kin send your cqird up; and if heoez you kin come up, I'll 'scorch you to de rooms." Well den I was in a fix. I neber did hab eDy cairds wid my name on in partickilyer, and I was for a minit put to an unbiush, but all at once I remembered dat I had a pack ob cairds, in my coat tail pocket dat I took away from Sam Lipley, Guss Trealms, Joe Sampson and Dave Kinney, when I found dem down by Caffrine market playing bluff on a'barrel head lass Sunday nite, in de moonshine, so takin out de Jack ob Spades I rote my name dus, J.

Den I hear de waiter say, "It aint a she. It am a he." "Get out," say de Presemdent, "de caird sez it's Hanner Bull, send her up." "Shill I send up de pusson dat rote dat name on de caird?" axed de waiter. "Presisely," said Massa Foolmore, and in anudder minnit I was at de doe. I gin a Rochester nock wid my fist, and -de doe was opened by de Presemdent heseff, who was more den delited to see me. HeI shook hands wid me, and 'wited me to take a seat.

'To wot class do you 'lude," I ax'd wid inrpatients, seeing how interested he was on de subjeck. "DE NEW BoYs," said he, "dey spend dere short exist- ence in spreadin abroad de lite ob siance." "Dat's a fac," said I, "dey wrk for de confusion ob use- ful nolage." "Let me ax you, Mr. Hannerbull," again returned he, insultin' de caird which he held wid my name on, "' Do de newsboys embrace de privilege ob usin de public baffs, which de corporation so wisely and so nobly instituted for dere use, and for de use ob de rest ob de poor folks dat hab to lib in submarine sellers and penned up apartments?" I told him he must be crazy, kase I nebber har ob dem baffs, and I didn't blibe from de 'pearance ob de boys dat eny ob dem did edder.

Den he axe me how de Picayune get along; an he was 'stonished wen I tole him dat obber tirty-five thousand copies was sold weekly; he said he got it ebery week at de Wite House; and den he axed me confidenshely if I couldn't stir up de 'Mare to keep de streets a littler clean,   "O        BLACK DIAMONDS. and remarked dat he was 'shamed ob de condishun ob de city.

It was emposable for me to get de hed ob de human body at the Horsepital, so I hab to use'dis sheep's head, which no doubt will answer de same purpos, 'kase it hab got de wool on. De fust bump in a cullered man's hed-and it taint no use bodderin 'bout enny odder man's hed-am siterated on de top, and called by de siantifick de cokanut bump; dis  bump lays in a triangular form ober de bump of don't-care- a-d-n-ativeness, which ebery black man's, hed. am fully blessed wid;i some ob de lower order ob cullered men habl got de bump of ori-gin-ality, which renders dem 'septable ob drinkin bad gin made up into slings and toddies.

De bump dat am moss cultiwated in de cullered man hed, am call'd on Fowler & Wells' map ob de brane, "Amative- ness." Dis am de bump dat plays de debil wid de fair sex, bekase dat am whar Kupid springs from; dis bump lays in de back ob de neck, near de-coat collar; it am call'd de bump ob Ilb!

De. bump ob "Benebolence" am sitemated on de top ob dis, but I don't see dat stickin out werry excrusi- atin on enny ob your heds;, but I may be mistaken, and wen de sasser goes 'round de -fac will probe itseff. "Combatavness" am found mitey big in de cullered race. It lays 'long side ob "Firmness," which bump am 'lustrated on de map by de jackass, which shows how much easyer it am to coax dan to dribe. Some people hab got bigger bumps dan odders, and dis am de way you will find it out: B s'pose you hab a squarrell wid a man and you call him a liar, and he sez,-"Ef. you call me dat twice more I'll smack you'cross de chops." Dat man hab got combataveness small, but ef at de moment dat you cAll de man a liar, you find youseff a rollin in de .gutter win you nose split open, you may make up your mind dat it sticks out on dat man's head so big you can hang your hat on it. "Cautiousness" am putty well enweloped too in cored   PHRENOLOGY,         1 43 man, and dat de reazin dey lub to hunt de same ole coon; dey kreep kaushisly 'long de fence till dey git rite under whar he am " a settin on a rale," and den wid telegrofick quickness he sezes him by de tail and trows him on de ground. Dis fac has 'spired de poets to rite songs 'bout it which you all noe by heart. "Self 'steem" am sum in de race likewise; also, sagdere horror ob swasheatin wid de wite trash, and de manner in which dey " steem up" ' kashionally, fully probes. "Imitation " is consnipcious 'mong d6m too, but de mon- key beats dem all holler in dat bump, which I 'sider no dis- grace to de monkey tribe; but one ob de biggest bumps found in de hole bed ob de decenters ob de- African race, Pcordin to de work ob Brudder\Bill Seaweed on Erective Frauchise, am call'd "Alamentiveness." Dis am de bump: dat enables a feller to tell wat am good to eat, an how much he ort to gormandize at a time; for inestinck, you- go in de seller by Caferine, Market, and you, see a man call for a plate ob, raw clams and a plate ob sassengers. Well, if he eat de clams and leabe de sassengers, den he got de small bump; but ef he eat em boff, den he got it big. Sum nig- gars got it mity big, dat dey not oney eat up. de clams- and sassengers, but call for a plate ob pork and beans, and want it "most all pork, and a good deal ob beans," to top off wid. I call dat hog eatin hog. And now dat I see I got you all in de noshun ob eatin, I will 'smiss you, so you kin go home and get a cold bite, and wile Brudder Lem Clawson passes round de sasser I will remark dat I don't want nobody to ring in dem new free cent pieces on me for a," fip," as was come on me lass week. I don't take em for sixpence no how.  c ,r   "4        BLACK DIAMONDS. LECTURE XLIV, MESMERISM. DARKENED HEARERS : It gibs me joy to see so menny ob you on hand dis ebenin. As de wedder grows warmer it will be empossable for you all to crowd into dis room, unless you hab a 'xtra- ordinary supply of kalonge water and essence ony pepper- mint 'mong your clothes. De subject dat I' call upon my- seff to spoke to you about on dis 'tickler 'caision am de twin sister to Freenology, which Freenology I used up last week all to nuffin. I shall open on you dis time on de great 'fulgent siance of MUSSMERISM. Dis ober powerful siance hab waked up de hole world, notwidstandin it am de sleepiest subjick in de hole wokabu- lary ob nateral fenomonens. It howebber hab nebber bin found out properly, nor nebber will be, I speck, till some lasrn'd cullcred man take it up and splanifys de whole ting. Dr. Cod's hab published a pulpit on de subjick, and Plio- fessor Greeley hab used it and heself up at de same time, but no lite wort perservin hab been shed by eder ob dese lunatics. Dr. Cods konteads dat Mussmerism lays in de brane!pan, wich pan lays in de top ob de bed. wich I tink s gly -. '   ^    -..   MESMERISM.'         145 like de fac, kase wen a rman lays down at nite to sleep, he head lays down lopsided too, which ob cose upsets de brane pan and spills de MAussmerism all ober de human system and puts de man to sleep; dat looks Lateral, and I tink ole Cods am rite. You musent 'spose, you poor ignumram- pusses, dat Mussmerism konsists in you ebber bein reddy to be a kickin up a muss wharebber you go, jis like Mose when he runs wid der merchene, kase dat kind ob siance am alto- gedder different from de siance 'spressed in my tex. Mussmerism, my stingy followers, am simply de art of puttin a feller creture -to sleep; an keepin him 'wake at de same time. It am jis dis--'spose Pompey Augustus Mouldy- heel dar, de barber's cleark's 'sistant, should happen to noe, whar- dar was a dinner pot full ob Kalifornia gold buried, and den 'spose I got Pompey in a chair, and arter spokin some latin- and "lapsus- lingo '" in he ear to sooff his fears, and H paw ober his face and trow de telemgrafic or magnitized burning fluid ober he arms and odder 'xtremities, and I git him fass a sleep-and den when he am asleep, 'spose ole- Fronse Ginger dar, de clam soup merchant, should pull he big toe and ax him whar de dinner pot ob money am, an den Pompey should tell him so he kin git it--dat's Mussmerism. "Wat's dat sister Jonson axes?" Ca  " 'Spose Pompey woodent tell 'bout de money, wat wood dat be?"                        ; "Why,- I should kall dat de blackest kind ob niggerism." De fungusmental principals of Mussmerism am foun in large qwantities in de lectric telemegraf, an am konwayed tru de human body wid all de liveliness ob a fresh bunch ob eels; it am a scase article 'mong ole maids and ole ba!ors, but young galls and boys now an den git a shock d^^ings dem togedder like an arthquake an make deir   "6 ,       BLACK DIAMONDS.

When it 'tacks de human body dat way it am kall'd by us larn'd scollers Anamal Magnitism, for de simple reason dat de magnetic sluses rush true de canals ob de body like de-de-de- like de-like fire. Now you all noe all 'bout dis 'culiar siance, and you kin hold your heads up proud as a lucifer match merchant. De collecshun lass week, owin to de introcumducshun ob de tree cent pieces, was not suffishent to pay my washwo- man, Ef you dont chip up enny better, previous to dis I shall be 'pelled to anser a berry loud call- from de Souff, dat I recebe lass week.  I am 'quested to state to dis congregashun dat dere am gwane to be a ball next Saturday nith at Yaller Cuff's seller, nie ole Bare Market, and stiort-heel'd Jake hab learned de dance kall'd de poker, and anodder one dey kall de shotteef, which he 'poses to teach to some ob de ladies on dat casion. Sam Ticklip will be dar wid he five dollar fiddle. No refreshments sarbed up widout de tree cents 'company each order for de same.

Now, when I say Provendence, you must not 'spose dat I mean a steambote ob dat name, nor de city dat bears dat apperation, dat lays a little to de leff ob de Sound, whichde trabbler hears in de East ribber, as he ascendingly goes down to Boston. De Provendence I mean sends us de bread and butter to eat, de cold water to drink, ad now and den de sassengers and root beer, and odder 'freshmeits. Yes, my frens, de Provendence I mean am a frend to de hole human race; he- makes no extinctshun atwixt de cullored peeples and-de wites, and derefore am to be fully trusted in at all times, kase heram sure to fetch all tings  rite and tite in time. j  Who sed "Hallumlujah?"   Look here, my suspe cted frens, I don't want nlarudder nor sister to interrupt me by- P  sich spokins out in meetin as dat, kase it trous de kar ob thort off de trac ob my diskord, and smashes my ideas all to a poultice, or a pumice, it's all de same.  olken ob Provendence fetches to my doddle an ole story ; dl ole Verginia darkey tole me. when I was a chile. X  imust noe, on a plantation at de Souff, whar de pos- ,     ,    '   "8        BLACK DIAMONDS. - sum and de sugar kane grow, dar was an ole lazy nigger dat dey call 1Provendence, 'kase ]te come dere in de middle ob de nite time, and none ob de odder niggers node whar he come from, and dey war told Massa Provendence sent him, derefore dey named him Provendence. Well, dere was anudder nigger on de plantation dat' dey kall'd Tune, 'kase he was always wistlin some new tune which he make out o) he own bed, and den he would play dem on de banjo in de ebenin,)arter de day's work war ober. Well, Tune and Provendence greate frens togedder, sharein 4  ebery ting dey got ('septin de lickins Provendence got for he lazyness). Well, de ole massa seein' wat a good, fait- less nigger Tune was, wanted to gin him his freedom ; but he found dat sich a sementin frenship 'xisted twene dem dat a preparation would be likely to probe fatal to boff, so he told  dem dat if dey jintly would urn so much- obber work in a gibin time, dey boff should be free. Dat make 'em smile berry loud, and kick up dere heels for joy. t4; in order to get de work done in time, Tune 'posed toirovendence to steal de march on de old Massa, and work on de Sunday ; but Provendence was too lazy to work week days, let alone Sundays, derefore poor Tune hab to do all de offer work heseff.' Well, one Sunday ole Massa hab" gope to church, and T4ne was workin' in de field by de rode side, and Provendence was loafin' on a haystack, sunnin' heseff, when an ole wite mishenary preechereman, who was a passin' on horseback' rode up to Tune and axed him "Why he worked on de sabbeff?" , '"Kase, said Tune, "ole sMassa sed if we git so much ober work done in sich a time he would gib us free, and den - you noe we kin raise de debil as much aswe like, and stay out arter nine o'clock, too." "Ah," said de preecher man, " freedom amworff wo -.%'.'   ON PROVIDENCE.         1  49 fur, sartinly; but don't you tink you could 'complish de' work by workin' a little longer each day ob de week?" "No, sar-ee," said Tune, "kudent do dat no how." "I tutik you kood," sed de wite man, "'spose yog try dis week kummin in, and put your trust in Provendene!'? , Well, when he told him dat, Tune tort he was a foolin' him, and he got mad, and swor'd, and sed, "Provendence be d----d ; he'm de lazyest nigger on de hole plantation, and if I trust to him we. nebber get free in de world. Go long wid yer; you don't noe who you am a-talkin' to." You see by dis fack wat it am to noe which Provendence it am to trust to. I am quested to state to dis congregashun dat de row at de ball in de seller lass Saterday nite was not'owin' to Sam Fugleson 'sultim Pacilla Emerline Stubbs., It was casioned by Joe Knothead spitin' on Clem Tuker's new patent ledder shiny shoes.

BLUBED SISTERS:  I SHAtL spoke to you in particelyer dis ebening, habin been inquested by Sister Florinda M.

Well, it was my lot, in my boyhound days to come across wun ob de kind I 'luded to in de lass claws. It was a moonshiny nite, and I was a settin in de boat on de ribber a bobbin for eels, when I spied her a settin on de bank ob de ribber a washin her feet. Oh, hallemlujah! didn't I feel quere! De eels kept a bitin at my bob while lub kept a nockin at my heart and pluck; she was de 14b- liest creatur I ebber seed (present company allers sus- pected) ; her eyes shine like two new silber dollars bound round wid black velvet; and her gum elastic lip open and shut on a row ob teef dat shine like bull dogs in a tunder shower, and her smile was like de sparkle ob de litening bug as he sales tru de florifous air, her form was graceless and A:- faultful. Oh I' I nebber shall forgit dat nite; le h bt flushesh shot tru and tru my wains, and de cold swet stood  on my forehead like de big rain drops ob de April shower; wun time I tort she was a gwane to spoke to me, and I helA my breff to cotch de sound, and den she didn't say notin,  but kept a danglin her feet in de water, and den all at wunce, when I tort she was a gwane to sleep, she axed me in de moss elemfant manner, "If I had enny luck?" "Yes, indeed," sed I; "I kotch two mity big eels afore you kim, but from de minit I seed you I kudent bob no more."  -    . "Wat's de reason?" she axed. I told her "I didn't noe, but dat it f what I say to you." "Well," sed she,           152        BLACK DIAMONDS. "Ef you aint agoin to bob no mo', You best put up you line and come asho'." I didn't want a second inwite, so I skull'd ashore and tiWe de boat fass, and as I was gis gwane to pick up my eels to take em home, she put her lubly arms 'round my neck, and i lookin me full in de face, like a lion looks at de piece ob raw meat, she whispered "Luff de eels be,  And talk to me." Well, den I felt wusser dan ebber, and in an ungarded moment L'lowed myseff to set down on de bank and make lub to her. Dar am no use ob my tryin to tell you how highfalutin I felt on dat 'tickler 'casion, kase I kudent do it ; I tort dar was a flock ob pigeons in my westcoat all a flut- terin to get out.

DELUDED DISCIPLES: IN quensiconse ob bein inquested by a brudder, who signs his inquest "Water st.," to lectur on de subject ob FUTURE PUNISHMENT OR DE LASS DAY, I hab 'eluded to do so on dis refulgent 'casion. It is not my 'tention or wish to lectur' on eny religius subjicks, but to please dis brudder I do so for dis wunce only. Dar am so many different 'nominations dat blibe in such a contrast ob future punishment, dat it puzzles eben a man ob my deep larnin, expended foolosophy and manure judgment, to gib eny ting like a solid chunk ob an 'pinion on de matter. One 'nomination blibe dat de wicked go to a big lake dat am burnin constantly wid fire and brimstone, and runs in streams ob liquid hot lead; dis lake am sed to be surroumd- ed by de mountains ob sin and misery, so dar's no 'scape. Arudder sect tink it am a hotter place dan de rest, and lot sassagefried wid de fire and brimstone, wish to mix in a uantity ob assafidity and kiam pepper, gist to make it dis- ingaree from de place dat de first 'nomination blibe in. A   fird sect tink dar am two orfull places ob dis kind run dey call purgetory, and de odder dey paint out to be ' hot as 'ub in August. Dis lass place am for murderers, eves, and sich fellers, and de odder am for hipocrits, wite irs, loafers, lawyers and actois. A fourth 'nomination discaird all dis kind ob punishment X       .                     .,.^^^^^   FUTURE PUNISHMFNT.       155 and blibe dat, like de man in tite boots, we recibe our pun- ishment as we go along. Ole Mr. Sweetzenbugger sez dat wen we lebe tdis atmost- fear we go to annudder and lib wid kindid spirits, so ob korse cullored peeple will lib wid cullered peeple[ ef dey am good, but ef dey am bad, dey got to smingle wid de wite trash gis de same as dey do in dis world ob sin and waccination. My poor ignumrent hearers, all dese 'nominations am per- fectly rite, and ef you don't blibe me gis ax eny wun ob dem and see ef dey don't tell you so-and I blibe dat it am a good ting for all ob us dat tings am as dey am, for ef de masses ob mankind war to blibe dar was no future punish- ment for de sinner, dey would run riot in sin and selfishness. and dis selestial airth would be turned into wun wast slaw- ter house and carwin shop  in less den no time. Man wouldn't stop to oney murder he feller man, but he'd sell de bones to de button factory and de flesh to de sassenger makers de same as dey do de dogs in dese days. Insted ob de kanals bein filled wid de blessed waters from de clar and coolin lakes, de kanal botes would float in de blood ob man- kind, and all creation would stan palsied wid a fright. I tink de more feeble de inteleck ob man am, de more nesessary it Am to keep dis burnin lake'in his mind, gis like my ole school massa used to lay his rattan on de front ob he desk and ax de boys wat he done wid it. It 'quires sumfin to keep people strate, so look out'wat you am about, ikeep you eye skinned for future faturiety, kase you kant swar you sins on enny body else on de lass day, like Pete Pifer did de stealin ob dat hundred clams on me. Ebery tub hab got to stan on it's own bottom den, and take de 'sponsibility ob deir own axes. Dat will be an orfull day for sum folks dat I nose dis minit. It am sed dat on dat day bone will come to bone and flesh   156        BLACK DIAMONDS. tot flesh. Now sposen a man start from here to de Ingen country, and in a muss wid de natives, he loses wun ob his arms; he den goes to Harlam and gits one ob his legs cut off by de rale road; he comes to town on de4t ob July and gits his eye nocked out by a sky rocket; aid oden lhe sets sail for Caleforny, gits de feber on de Ismarass, and dar dies-dar he lays till dey dig him up to make de rale rode track, when he bones am used to fill up holler places on de rode ; all dis might easily happen, my stingy hearers. Well, ef " bone cumes to bone" on de lass day ob de world, I tink dar would be some dodgin ob heads to keep out ob de way ob de limbs, and I also tink dat a cummitty on researches would hab to be 'pinted to find de main carcuss. All dis, ob korse, am merely speckemlashun on my part, as de man said wen he offered to swop off his wife. Dar will be an' end to- ebberyting dat hab a beginnin, and as de world hab a begun, ob korse it will hab a stop; but, my frightened sinners, you got noting to fear ef you do your duty here to de best ob your nobility; let i not your konschence be, seared wid de yaller leaf ob sin, and you ken stan and look on de doins ob de lass day wid komposer. De brudder dat wished me to lectur on dis subjick I tink muss be a man berry much troubled in konschence, and amso much in dread ob fire dat he won't lib in eny odder strete dan Water strete; de name hab a coolin influenza on he spirits, and de' strete run along de riber, so I 'pect .he tink he ken jump in when tings come to a crisis, but he'll find it's no use-ef he am found rotten at de heart; old Jimmy Splitfoot will fork him up from de bottom wid de hook on de end ob he tail. Now, as I had reached de tail ob sumfin, 1 tink I had bet- ter end my discord, at de same time tankin you for your airnest 'tention, and for wat small change you will put into :- de sasser wen Julious Hosshed hands it round. , Dar am a   ACQUIRED' HABITS. gwane to be a gibbin visit to my house nexweek, wen I spect you will all tow de mark. "ECTUKE   XLVIII. ACQUIRED HABITS. OUDATIOUS FRENDS: CONSIDERIN de state of de wedder, I has 'cluded to spoke to you dis ebenin on de subjeck of HABITS, and-in spokin bout dem, I don't intend to meddel wid old cloze or wid anybody's good habits; but I shall gib bad habits pickelyer square-toed conepton fits. Everybody, from de Mayer down to de lime-killn man, will tell you dat bad habits ort to be trown off and de- carded. And now de question rises like a ghost in de feater -what am bad habits? Ef I was to tell dis congregation to trow off dere bad habits in one sence, dere wood be few mong you dat wood hab any cloze on, kase most ob your habits am bad. Second handed afore you git dem, and derefore bad in fit and durability And ef I wur to tell you to trow off your bad habits in anudder sence, youavood 'pear afore de world a miricall, kase a man widout eny bad habits am a model man for sartin. Dere am so menny bad habits dat mankind am up to, dat it wood take your wordy speaker two weeks and a fortnite   158        BLACK DIAMONDS. to classify, rectify, ratify, and magnify wid ennyting like suc- cess. But I will spoke ob a iew dat I find most prebalent 'mong you fellows. And fustly I shall draw your under- standins to Liein. It seems a part ob a cullard man's natur to tell Ingin-rubber stories, from a nasty habit ob liein in bed mornini, in he youf he soon larns to lie out ob it-as he grows up, and afore he nose it, he will lie as fast as a political noosepaper. Den dars anudder habit de darkey 'dulge in to sartin extent-and dat am stealin. And as de poet sez-  "Fust he steal a tater, Den he steal a grater- Den when wite folks am asleep, He steal de chicken, eggs. and sheep." Sum say it am he natur to do so, and if it am, he larn it from de wite trash, kase dey inhabited de kedentry fuss. But de darkey am not de only pusson who hab bad habits --kase notin am more nasty dan chawin backer, smokin old sogers, and drinkin rum. De Dutch am putty well posted up in de two fust claus, and if you'll show me an Irishman dat don't know how de latter claws am complished, I'll show you a wezel in he nite cap and mornin gown takin a snooze. De Dutch larn der children to smoke soon as dey see de lite ob de libin sun. Insted ob gibin dem a sugar stick to suck on, dey put a segar in dey babys' mouf, and in two days de chile will cry for a match to lite its segar, same as odder chile cry for mint stick. Chawin I tink comes by instink-for jis as soon as a chile nose ennyting, it finds out de use ob its jaws. Now I myseff was lailnd a bad habit in my infuncy, when I was- handsomer and more interestin dan now--and dat habit was   ACQUIRED HABITS.        159 chawin-I don't mean backer, but witals.

Derefore I take my old Gen.

I went doun to sebrel aJ&olishun brudders in New York, and got letters ob inducement to sebrel brudders in dis town ob crooked streets and hotels.

Den he laff, and sed I was stupid, and dat ef I speck to sleep enny, I muss take a birf in a foreard car cabin, and pay fifty cents extra for de same. So I paid de bitterance, and airly ex- pired to bed ; but all de time Isabille was a runnin in my wool, and like fleas on a shaggy dog, dere wus no gittin rid ob it.

I picked up two or tree and took dem' to de steward, and ax him what he done wid dem fellers abord. He sed he put 'em dar- to fatten on darkeys till dey grow as big as sea turkels, and den wen dey got to be big-bugs, he stuffed fried 'monkeys wid dem, wid cowcumber sass, and perturnip dump- lins. I soon found out dat I coodent git no sassagefacshun from him, and as I dident want to spend de nite 'mong sikh suckers as I found in my berf, Lhad to walk'de deck all nite, L and wen I woke up in de mor nin I found I hadent slept none all nite, apd I wus sick abed.

De reason was, I speck he tink I was a confugetif from de Souf, But it didenit worry me none, kase I hadent bin here in dis city morn a nour afore de news Iribed by de spress wagon dat I wus dere, and a cummittee ob forty-fibe from de Anti-Ig- 4 -numrence Benefishal-own-your-own-Shirt Siety, waited on me at de hotel, wid red aprons on, and bajjers on der cotes; :J     GRAND RECEPTION AT BOSTON.     183 and formin a paltroon in frunt ob de house, I walked out on de pizarro jis as stiff as ef I borded dere, and felt as proud as Daniel Lobster, when he 'dressed his cornstockewents, frum the same place lass year, 'bout E' Plurebus Unum and Political Politicks. i  De kommitte told me  re wus at great gedderin ob de culored folx at Brudder Jonson's Eatin House, watin to heer me spoke. I pulled out de ruffle ob my shirt, and jined de breddern at once. They toted me up one crooked ?treet and down anudder crooked 'treet, and cum round to. -de place whar we started from, and den dey led me doun a holler in a 'treet 'bout tree. foot wide, and at de sine ob de ,t"I Black Sheep" we stoped an went in. Here I found a big room filled wid bpudders and sisters, who recebe me wid much stinkshun. Under de big room was an eatin restora- -tive-de reason why dey call it a restorative, am bekase a good many tings hab bin restored to der ritefull owner, dat de police hab from time immoral found on de premices. Dere wus a platform at one end ob, de room, and 'pon it set my old friend Deacon Snowhall. He rised and induced me to de bredderin, and den took he seat. I axed him wus he gwane to spoke, and he said no, dat he had to gib up preachin sometime ago, kase like odder preecher mans, h'i  'got de brownkritters in de trote, but he coodent, lile de fellers, go souf for he helf,. so he had to grin and bare itf? and choke it doun de bess way he cood.

Den dey took up a prescript tion in a hat, fur me, mountin to fibe and sixpence and two bad pennies, and den dey wited me to go to supper below. Wen I got dar I found a long table spred wid plates, wid j '   -184    r    BLACK DIAMONDS. five roast clams, in de shell on ebery plate, and a cracker by ^de side. Soon as we eat de clams, we had a corse ob clam soup-den a corse, ob fried clams, den more rost clams, and den a doenut a piece ; den we had cowhlay soup ; tomatto, stew'd wid figkcaseed turnips; den- dere wus a corse ob Welsh mabbit,;stewed in de shell, serbed up wid turtle dube jelly and skipper cheese (we had a lively time wid dis cheese). * It cum all de way from- Smiff's Iland, nie Fidelfy -den dere wus a great wority'ob meat-sheep, lam and mutton, and burloney sassengers turnd ober-and de cum- pany perspired for de nite--and I went to bed, too, dere bein one prepared -fur me in de house.

"OQUACIOUS LAMS: ODE season will afford me a subjick for wibration dis ebenin. We am now, 'cordin to de almanack, in de midst ob de Ingin Summer. De wildest poets ob 'Merica hab ,used up sebreal quires of foolscap and penny candles in tryin to do justice to de perculiat emotions dat dis season always trows into de hart ob de lubber of natur ; but dey can't do it to dere sassagefaction, and derefore dey try a new one at ebery return ob it. De reson dat it am eall'd de Ingin sommer am bekase de wedder, like de Ingin, am mity treacherous, and unsartin; de sun will'rise as yellar as a big pumpkin in de mornin, and will warm up de arf like he does in June, for a nour or two, and den he luff a ice bugg cum afore his face, and chill all creation by dinner time, and cause a rise in coal ob tree cents on a haff a peck afore nite.

Sum he tinged in gold, some in purple and sum in red-de ceder, like de hard hearted sinner am too proudi to turn, and derefore am gis as green as ebber. De lass time I seed dese trees dey wus all beaufully green, like a newly arribea boy from de country, and, like de lad, dey sported away in de full -belief dat dey wood always be young and bright; but old Jack Frost hab 'bin mong dem, and sprinkled dere heads wid frost; and de lebes, like de  follies ob youf frum de old, man, am fallin tick and fast frum de old staid trees, lebin dem stripped and sturdy to widstand de blastin winter.

MY STINGY HERERS-- I PROMSED lass week to tell Sous who and what Brig-a-Dig Gen'ral Windy Scotch am; derefore, he him- self will form de lenf and breff of my subjick dis ebenin. Glen'ral Scotch was born'in a soger cote, wid big bell buttons' on, wich de nuss sed was a nignomen dat he was born for a soger man-which nignomen cum true rite away; kase as soon as Scotch was big nuff to know a broomstick from a mustick, he enter'd de armey as a powder monky, and showed as great sagashity for de okkepation as Donazetta's Artists do for deres. He soon ribed to be captin of a miletary company, and when he was dressed up in de unicorn wid his knackbacks. on he back and appledoff on he sholders, he look'd as brave as a sheep in a butcher cart. From ridin' de broomstick in airly life he soon lernd to ride a hoss, and wen he was;mounted on his hobby he could outride riders, and he grew up a great gen'ral, berry fond ob sogerin and clam soup. Dere am no noein when he fust akkuired de lub ob soup, but he has 'dulgd his apertite freely for a long time. De only time when he forgot dat healfy beberage was when he cum down on de British at Lunday Lafie, and giv' dem fits wid charge bayenets. Talk 'bout yur telemgraffs! why he bete dat all holler in de rapidity of he movements; and afore de dnemeazels had time to blow de smoke away from afore dere afrited vizagers, he was on dem and all ober dem like a pot ob soup a bilin obber, and dey gub up de ghost; and den -^   ON GEN. SCOTT.        193 de poets make song 'bout de wictory, and de Gen'ral took a  plate ob soup.  De nex' time his deeds stood out on de page ob history was when he took de soger boys -to Mexico, And gub dem stingo From Sandamingo, b- y jingo! !  Dese Mexicans kicked up a mus wid us, and tort dey cood : flog ole ruff and reddy. But ole Pork and Beans gub dem fits. Dere was an old she dragon down dere named -Sarah Gorden, dat none ob de natives. cood master. But Massa Gen. Taylor took de starch out ob her bonnet, and left her in notin but a terrable bussel. Well dere was one feller dat took up de fite for her, kase she got whipped, and he was found one mornin' by daylitq by Gen. Scotch, who was a marchin' on to Mexico. Dis feller's name was C. Palter Peck, and when Gen. Scotch told him to surrender, he sed he'd see him burn'd fust, else he wood in a minerte. Well den de Gen'ral tuk a hasty plate ob soup, and went at him and tan'd he jacket for him in less den no time, and sent him- home wid a bloody nose'and a flea in he ear for he gublerment. Den he took a plate ob clam soup for 'freshment and 'laxation, and sent home de dispatch wid all de rounds ob de fite in it. Den he took more clam soup and moved on to de town ob Mexico, where he marched in at de head ob de army, like King Shibbreem ob old did when he went "Away obber Jorden." Here he made de peeple pay all his 'xpenses for comin' dere to lick 'em, land den he come home and made capital on de intrest he got in Mexico, or else he made intrest on 9   194        BLACK DIAMONDS. de capitol, I don't noe which; but he cum back, and de sogers here turn'd out and he view'd dem and review'd dem to he hart's content. Den he, took a plate ob clam soup for beseff. Well de nex' ting we here ob him he am nomenated for to be de Presemdent ob de Sunited Tates, by de conwenshun ob wig makers at Baltimore, and I tell you he makes a tall canditate-he is six foot ten or ten foot six in his stockins, I forget which. He can play de Scotch fiddle fuss rate, kase he took lessons from ole Professor Scratch heseff. Dere's one ting dat makes me 'mire he taste, and dat's he great lub ob clam soup. If dere am enpyting dat shows de uppecurian, it am a lub ob clam soup, and derefore, I go for him; kase if he get 'lected, clam soup will be de order ob de day, and Anty Clawson will make a fortun'. And-who put de lites out dere? Say I who wos it? I beer you all a snickerin in. de dark. I find out by nex' "lectur' nite, and I'll gub dem fits.

Tings hab got to dat pitch when a rise in camfene am considered nessesa y, in order to meet de grate demand by the free cent dealers. Takin all dese tings into 'sidera- tion, I hab 'cluded, by de help ob de almanack, to discord to you dis ebenin on de subjick ob MORAL MORALITY. I tink it behaves me to spoke plain, so dat you, my frens, may not fall wictums to de wices ob de day. I found out a good dele 'bout de moralityob de age todder nite, berry akedently, too, dat pulled de wool off ob my eyes maisinly.  I will tell you how it wus, for your edication. You all noe Dandy Lem, one ob de hundred head waiters at de Misterpolitan Hotel.  Well, Lem wus one ob de main infrinments in gittin up de Sarahnade for me on de nite I cum home from Bosson, and played upon the comborion on dat noisy 'casion--so I:tort one nite lass week, when I wus walkin out for medowtation, dat I'd gis stop in and see him; so I call'd at de kitchen door, and wus soon seated atween two ranges full ob fire, whar de debometor must hab been a good ways above phizarro, kase I took a warm baff in 'bout   196         BLACK DIAMONDS five minits. Ef I had been libin on de Isle ob Wite, which I find on de map ob Jersey, I coodent a felt more tleached den I did when Lem cum doun stars and rescued me frum my meltill mood by witin me up stairs in his'" studio," whar he blacks de gemmlon's boots. Dar we talked ober de art ob polishin different tings, and Lem sed he had recebed a stucent dat day to larn de art. I told Lem dat his profes- shan wus pretty much like mine, and odder great teachers ob mankind, kase we all tried to polish de understandins, and I dident see but what he made de -best show ob he laburs. Dat made Lem -feel mity proud. Arter complimentin nme on my siantific requirement, he axed mnie ef I ebber seed a play, in de play-house. I told him, (i Yes ; I recumlocked goin to de teatre, gis to study character, when young and afore my edication was confuted and finished, and seein Hamlet, or Gimblit, de Prince ob Dunkirk, where one ob de Rochester Nockers cum  to tell de Prince 'bout de syrup ob swills on de Porkenpine-and I once seed Micalbeth performed by a Scotch soger mian in berry short cloths." "Ah," sed Lem, "talk ob short close, gis you curm wid me fru de private door us fellers hab made fru de garret wall, and I will take you to de gallery ob Massa Niblo's Saloon, and I'll show you sites in dat way." So I followed Lem up a dozen crooked stairs, and at last he opened a little door, and sure 'nuff we was in to Niblo9s gallery. De house was full ob folks, and as I looked down 'pen de stage, I seed. a hole lot ob lubly lookin wimmon jumpin' bout in dresses dat make me blush. "It shocks  my modesty berry much," sed I to Lem, "but I wish I had one ob dem dubble barreld spy-glasses dat I see all de gemmon hab, gis to see 'zactly how neer being dressed dey am."   MORALITY.          19 As I sed dis, a tall figure dressed in a suit oh jacket and tight briches, cum bouncin on de stage.  "Who am dat?" axed I to Lem. "Dat's Madum Soso," sed Lem. "Git out," sed I, 'stonished to de back bone. "Dat aint a womon do., am it?" "Yes it am," sed Lem. "She's dancin out de caractor ob de ' Sivil Barber,' and dat lady dere, in de gauze dress, am Miss Pourgee; de pepil like to see 'emr as much unlum- bered wid dress as possibel."  Well, I wus puttrified wid 'stonishment, to see Soso and de rest-kick up dere heels, frow der legs up, and hear de folks scream ancore, or sho'w more, I coodent disackly hear which, but de more dey'danced and spiun 'round, de more de pepil liked it, specily de ole wite heded fellers in de seats nie de fiddlers-dey stamped and claped and smacked dere ole chops so loud dat I heerd dem plain 'nuff to be sartin. Putty. soon all de ladies in piink stockins and short frocks cum doun to de lites, and made dere arms aund legs-fly in ebbery direcshun ; den dey all whirl'round and'try to make a pot chese like de school girls does, and den doun cum de curtin, and de gass at de same time. "Why, I   dident speck to see sich tings as dese," sed I to Lem, as we  groped our way back. "I tort dis wus a garden, full ob trees and flowers."' "So it an," sed Lem, "fur 'bout fifty foot in da middle ob de lot, dey call it garden to kotch dem pepil dat like to whip de debil 'round de stump.  Dere am a great menny folks who wood go to a   garden, Museum, Atlhaneumi, or a Lyceum, when dey woodent be seen at a  teatre." "But whars de differe ce?" asked I. "De odds," grinningly, sed Leml.

I shall derefore emty my nolege box on de siance ob t   QUACKERY.         199 QUACKERY. Ef a furiner wus to belebe all he hear on his ribal to dis kedentry, he wood put us doun in he scrach book, for a nation of quacks; for he am sure to hear somebody call'd a quack 'bout ebery nour in de day, and de fact can't be got ober, nor under, dat dere am a great menny different kinds ob quackery runnin loose all ober de komunity. We hab de quack doctor, de quack preecher man, de quack lawyer, de quack politishun, de quack artist, de quack boot- black, and de quack lecturer. But it is mity hard for us poor ignorent sinners to find out who am de quacks from de Simon pure, ob all de professions in life. Eben I; myseff, wid all my siantific resorses, hab been foold in one way and aniudder, till I douted my own wisdom; but I Chab cum to kind ob refmetick rangement wid myself, by which I can suffer up de merits agin de demerits ob folks I meet in de world at large, and cum to my own cornclusions, and I will tell you how to find 'em out. Wen you hear a preecher-man take he. tex frum de scrip- tur, and preech from de newspapers, and when he use de words ob our Saviour, to probe his politikal docktren in de pulpit, you may in safty bet your dinner dat he am a quack I and I don'tsnoe a more contempable man in de site ob de Lord and man, dan a quack in relegion. When you hear a lawyer talk 'bout sacrificin he kon- shunce to he bizness, and offerin to stake his existence on de rezult ob your case in de ward cort, and at de same time wants a V or an X for his 'pinion, and boasts ob he nolege ob Blackstone and Bluestone, ef you aint got a nose dat am too flat to smell, you can plainly smell quackery and bad gin, while he ajm talkin to you. When you heer a pollytishun spout 'bout his lub ob   200        BLACK DIAMONDS. country, and de dreful sacrifices he am daily 'makin for de same, and tell you dat his 'ponent am a liar, a scoundrel, a jack-ass, ,a platoon, a drunkard, a coward and a tief, you may ta e your oaf on a stack ob my leckturs, dat he am a quaclk clean doun in he boots. When you see a gineral, dat am nominated for a high office, runnin all ober de country to finrd a lot big anuff to bild a Horsepital to keep he wounded in, and stunlpin it all de way long, you may put it doun as comstructive quackery in de third degree, as de Jury sed, when old Jake Longhed stole de saddle wid-a horse under it. De quack artist am pretty easily seen fru, but it takes some little time to find 'em out, and dats de reason so meln ny ob de furener musicians and actors dat send money and ready written puffs ahed ob dem, draw one or two big houses afore de folks fiudd out dere true merits, and dey find dere lebel. But de quack dat hab puzzled me de moss to find out, am de quack doctor. Go totlthe AlempafSst, and he will put he hand under he coat-tail and patronizingly tell you dat de home-pafist, de Crono Turmal, de Water Cure man, and de root-beer and'yarb doctors, all am quacks: Go to eder ob dese fellers, and dey will tell you de same 'bout all de udders, 'cludin de Allapofist. One am always callin de oder quack, 'till a comnion man donit noe which one to chose in case ob sickness. I seed a berry 'musin seene once, in de 'treet. It wus quite singular dat so menny different kinds ob docktors shood meet gis at dat time, at dat spot;, but so it fell out or fell in, gis as you like. One day, when I was takinl a strole, pickin up reflecslans for you, I seed a young mob 'round a feller dat lay squirmin on de sidewalk. Dere wus haff a' dozen different docktors 'rouud him, and dey were 'sputin who cum fust, and wlio's pashent he wus. De alempafist , , #   QUAKE     .     201 clamed him, and had he lansit in he hand, and wanted to bleed him. He, sed it wus a case ob " lhighstrikes," and orl to be blistered on de trunk or chest, I forget which. De homopapist sed it wus /his case, and calld for a' tub ol water, and sed dat ef de water wus got, and he wus to drop one ob he little pills in it, and luff de man smell it tree times true de weeli, dat he wood be well by Sunday. Dis brought otua hydropafist present, who sed' "De man don't want to 'sme)l de water, or taste it; he muss hab he lied ducked fider all ober, all de morning." A man wid a paper ol kiann pepper in he hand, beged dat dey woodent fool wic de man, but take him at wonst to some Tom Sonian -doctors and hab de disease biled out wid ellick conlpain and sassa gefax., While dey were arguin de pint, de man contribed to set up, and looking at de crowd ob specktators-wid a gaze wordy ob old Toodles, seed, ".Now see here, you fellers don't noe noffin 'bout my case. It ain't water I want, but brandy. I allers did hate that water, and only took it as a medicine." De doctors all sloped, while de people laffed. De fact wus, de man had been taken suddenly drunk, and coodent nuavagate wid he load no furder, and had fell doun. Now de question rises, which one wus de quack? Deres no- tellin till I git to be a stugent ob medicine'myseff, and put- de- world rite. De blackgards will meet on de useal corner to practice de trowin ob old cuds of 'backer and stumps ob segats on wite hats till taken up by de police, prebious afore goin a target shootin. tDaddy 'Rice will please pass 'round de sasser dis time. De hat he used on de last 'caishun I'm afraid hab got a false crown in, for de kolleckshun wus radder short. 9*   : 202       BLAGC DIAMONDS. "ECTURfE LXI. ' BOOK-KEEPING. PALUTED SINNERS.: I I HAB bin inquested by a disciple who sines he name "Clerk,' to lecture dis ebening on de subjick ob BOOK-KEEPING. Derefore, I will do de same, in order to pleese de inquisitor. I ddn't noe no clark myseff, spechely, 'septin Tom Woolly- paight's oldest boy Jim, who am clerk to a barber's assist- ent in Antony stre et, and I don't belebe he nose 'nff 'bout book-keepin. to lAst him ober nite, derefore I kant kontribe who it am dat wants litenin on dat subjick. Book-keeping am one ob de dryest subjicks dat I ebber 'tempted to kogetate, and I donAt noe ob a dryer set ob fellers den de book-keepers gincerely am. One book-keeper told me dat de dryest time he ebber 'sperience, was durin the monff ob -August, when he had to book ober twenty tousand boxes ob, red herrin. It 'fected him to dat degree dat he took to drink for more den a week artewards. He positively 'serted dat while he was bookin dese tings, his troat got so dry dat he spit notin but little bits ob cotton all de time. Derelam sebrel kinds ob book-keepers. Deres de feller dat keeps all de books he kin borrow or steal-den deres de publishers who am compelled to keep more books dan dey want, 'speshely ef dere books don't take. Den deres de folks dat buy more books den dey keep, and dose o   BOOK-KEEPING.        203 dat keep more books den dey buy, and I is compelled to say dis tatter class am as tick as skeeters in September. Book-keepin hab more to do wid de welfare ob mankind den a man would be apt to see at fust sight widout de aid ob a pair ob filosofical specktickels, for I find dat all de success ob man's life in dis world and in de world to come, am in a berry great degree dependin' on how he books balance. Ef de biggist sum am loud to cumalate on the rong side ob he legger, he bizness muss bust up, and he go to de Poor House, and ef he can't show a clean sheet, well balanced, when de final 'counts ob de world am settled up, he will be apt tofind heseff in a wors place den a Poor House. But prudence, economy, and a proper exemcise ob de bump ob "Iib widin your income," will perwent de fuss catastrefy, and an upright life will balance de sheets in de great book ob life. Dis great book ob life am a berry serious ting for a man look into,- ef he 'zamin it closely. Ebbery day opens a clean sheet, whereon you may rite good deeds, charity, lub to your fellow man, and homage to de gibber ob all good; or you may rite I cheated my nabor, I wronged de widdow, Ifol1'd wid de gifts ob Providence, got drunk, and in de Station House, or ennyting els eou pleese. But de worst ob it am dat what am wtunst put down in de book ob life ka:n nebber be scratched out. Its ritten in 'delable ink by de hand ob de recordin angil, and ole Satan heseff kant rub it out.' M: u kant recall de sins ob to-day, to-morrow, morn den you k/an cure de headake arter a drunk by promicein not to git drunk agin. I ,heefd a story 'bout old Uncle Sam Luckey and he rat- * taild dog, dat I tinik am hiely isustrated on dis fac." Ole Sam and he dog wus a loafin' round Washington   204       - BLACK DIAMONDS. Market- one mornin, and in dere walks dey ste-ped 'bord on one ob de fishin smacks dat lay in close congelement to do market, and arter lookin at de size ob de king fish and porgees, and feelin de wate ob de clams,-ihe come to a dozen big lobsters dat lay on de poop deck. De dog followed blim, and got 'mong de lobsters, and ole Pete Scaley, de Captain ob de smack, tort he'd hab a little fun aid de dog, so he slily pull'd de plugs out ob de bidg claws ob one ob de lobs- ters, and in less den a minrit de pendin tail ob dat dog, dat had hung doun as beauful .and strate as a penny dip, wus clutched twene de claws ob de lobster, and got a squeze heretofore unnoine to de dog, Ponto gub one yelp and leap togedder, and landed on the warf, lobster and all, and away he went true de market, under de feet ob de huxtors and de pie woman, and 'mong de legs ob de butchers, who" evidently tort he needed pluck, for dey trowed 'dem at him at ebery ; turn. At last he got'out ob de market, ard up he went to Broadway, and scattered de swells and belles in ebbery ::: direction. Pete Scaly and Uncle Sam looked arter de dog in stonishment, and Pete seeing'. dat he wus likely to pay i-:': de price ob lobster for he joke, calld out to -Uncle Sam to whistle back de dog. But all Pete cood git out ob UTicle . Sam was, "You wthistle back your lobster." But dat lobstr' wus like de deeds ob yesterday, it coodent be whistled back,; and gis as dat lobster cotch dat dog, so ole Satan will cum de open and shut game on you, ef you don't keep youar .eye - skinned for future futurity.

But dis ain't tellin you now I got dis bunged eye, which I ment to do in the fust place, but now I'll tell you all 'bout it.

De bride had on a pink frock wid loose sleebes and roses, and on her brow sat a wreaf ob orange blossoms, and for fear dat enny. ob de folks woodent noe what dey wus, she wore a big orange in her hair 'mong de blossoms, which made her look some punkins, now; I tell you. De- groom wore wite trowsers, green gerocco boots, red west,: green cote, wid brass buttons, and in he bosom a dogseera- tipe ob his lub, in a gilt frame 'bout six by six, which gub him a berry pickturesque 'pearence.        f Putty soon arter I cum in, dey went a whisperin 'bout, and den big Ben, de whitewasher, wid his hand witewashed, to look like wite kids, cum to me and sed, "We're reddy.'

He ludes to my prase ob clam soup. I will 'mit dat I lub dat artickle, but de reason I was so brilliant on it, was for fear dat sum ob dem skillin lecturers at de Tu)ernickel mite do it afore me, and git all de credit. I will not detain sich a hungry lookin crowd as you from your supper, no longer. I don't beliebe one ob you hab eat as much as a cracker sence you heer 'bout dis god-send to you.

When I wus done spokein, we journied to Anty Clawson's seller, and precipitated ourseffs into de clam soup and odder luxeries, 'bout which, I hab not time to tell you dis ebenin, but I will tell you ob it nex week, maybe. I got home, some how, afore daylite, and woke de nex mornin wid de useal bumble bees in my bed. I wus jis gwane to send for a Second Soda Bottle wid my lass sixpence, when. a man coie to de doa, and axed for me. I axed him to cum in, and what he wanted wid me. He told me he was de Smiff. "Smiff!

Ef you don't fork ober, I'll go take de tings out ob de winder in Fulton street, and sell dem at oxshun." Well, to cut a long tail short wid de sheers ob brevety, I had to borrow de money from Anty Clawson, to pay de bill, and I got to pay it back out ob de kollecshtzn dis ebenin. Now ain't you a putty set ob ongrateful scorpians, to humbug me in dis way. I told de kommittee on de hole dat I coodent efford to hab de tings presented to me, kase I node I wood hab to pay for de hole opperashun like the wite fellers, but dey persisted in complishin der bisness on me, kase dey node a supper on de 'caishun wus indispute- able, and dey cood all stuff der jackets as full as a berlona sassenger, free gratis for nofin at my xpense, and dey went in for de same wid a pertickler rush-but I'll fix dar flints afore I'm done wid dem.

SUSPECTED FILABUSTERS- IN my lass discord to you, I gub you a descriptshun ob de persentin' ob a set of plate to your loing suspected teacher, and I told you dat maybe I wood tell you 'bout de supper dat I had to pay for at Anty Clawson's. But as dore wus berry little 'curred afore my recolecshun wanished, (which wus along 'lout twelbe o'clock), wordy ob note, septin dat George Augustus Thomas More Horace Greely Henly Clay Butts, a niece of Anty Clawsofl's, cum nie ihockin heseff to deff wid a bio Cow Bay clam dat he tried to swallow in de shlell-and Unele Jake Longheel took a drink ob punch so liot, dat it killed all de brown creturs dat he hab had in he troat for the lass two monffs-de fac am, I belebe dat punch was made out ob canlfene, for I'll stake my dinner dat it wus strong nuff to kill at sixty yards ; and it, or de clam-soup, or de sassengers, or de hoe-kake, or de raw clams did cum putty nie killin Anty Claw son sheseff. She told me nex day dat in de middle ob de nite-tinme she wus taken wid an orful case ob de Wat-you-call-it, and she got up and took niely a pint ob Wats-its-namrue 'afore de lobster, or de sassengers wood lay still. Uncle Tone Clawson swares it wus de sassengers, for lie sez he heard a growlin in de bed afore Anty woke up wid de pain. Now, as we all ob us noe putty neer what sassetgers am made ob, Uncle Tone's argument seems clar. A great menny people hab bin doun to de Picayune Office   HOW IT'S OFTEN DONE.       217 to 'spect de set ob plate in de winder; all day long de walk am crowded, and all who sees it, 'sclaims: how beauful, how chaste! but dere am berry few dat nose how much dey had to be chased-arter afore jist de pattern de kommittee on de hole wanted cood be found. Dey chased into ebbery junk shop in de sity for that clam-soup tereen, and dat elemgent pitcher.. De coughfee pot was made by de tin-man, which I had to pay for, as I thole you lass week. I feel mity prowd sense I git dese tings, aldo I had to pay for de supper and de tings myseff, and rite all de speeches dat was sed to me as a stincshun ob honah-and I hab worn my best Sunday cloze ebber sense. As I lemonade down Broadway de gem- mens look at me fru der eye glasses, and all-de ladies peep out ob de, corners ob dere brite eyes, as much as to say, I wonder who am goin to share de tea tings wid you? Ebber;body smiles on me, kase dey all noe dat all de siance in dis world dat am worf noins am locked up in the noledge box, which am opened once a week for the litenment ob de human mind and pockets. While I get de-smiles ob one party, I get de frowns ob de odder, and I don't car. When I fust commenced lecturin, two years ago, I did my bess to suit ebbery body, but I found- dat was as imposable as for me to raise a dollar at de present 'speekin 'bout my close, derefore I gub it up, for I seed dat dere was sum in my congregashun jis like der am in ebbery older congre- gashun, dat .neber was pleesed wid anyting, not eben dere own seffs. Sence I commenced to lite up de dark walks ob siance wd de gas lite of nolege, dere'hab bin a good menny wite men'dat become as jealous as tunder ob me, and tried der bess to swamp me by gibin shillin lecturs, two shillin lecturs and haff a dollar lecturs, and now seein dat I am still, rooster ob de prominade here,- dey hab sent ober to, London, whar de newspapers hab stole my lecturs, and got 10   218        BLACK DIAMONDS.

WOMAN'S RIGHTS. BELUBED BRUDDEN- SINCE I descended de roosterum, as we say in Tur- key, to poligamate de beauties ob siance in all its warious colors, dere hab bin sich a h rd ob lecturers swarmin' de town, dat, pon my word, it seens as do de lowcuses of Egipt, dat we reed 'bout in de spelum book, had lighted on dis community, and deafen de public ear wid dere buzzin. We hab Lecturers from Europe, who cum here to comfab wid de Snobocracy ; we hab Lecturers from Boston, who cuim to tell us 'bout de Pilgrim's Progress to de Plymoff Rock, and de way to manefactur wooden meg nuts and pegged shoes ; we hab Lecturers from Turkey, who lecture on Greese, and Greasy lecturers talkin' 'bout Turkey. Konsorts am no longer call'd Konscrts, but Musical Lecturs, in which music amfry'd brown, and made radder ober done by five hundred choras singers. But de most remarkable ob all de mankind lecturers am de woman-kind, who cum 'mong us and trow down the gimblet, or gauntlet-I forgit which, but it am all de same -arid openly declar' war wid de Lord ob Creation for de breeches, and spout 'bout wot dey call Woman's Rights. Now, I hab'hard a good deel 'bout dese Woman's Rights, and sebreal ob de sisters hold a con-wenchon like de wite women, on de subjick, lass year, which you will recommem- ber ended in a fite, by sum low cullord pusson puttin' out rp-   BLAC DIAMO0NS. de lites jis as Ant Rachel wns gwah to spoke on de prebe- lence ob Liein and darkey babies. Dese shemale cogetators talk all de time 'boat Woman's Rights, and nebber say a word 'bout Woman's Leffs. Now, I like to noe boff sides ob ebbery question, and derefore I will mentibn a few ob der Leffs as well as dere Rights ; aud in .huntin' up ebedence on de question, I find dat one woman left a baby at de door ob an Alderman, lass week ; anodder leff one at de house ob a Priest, all done up in red flannel and holdin' a track in its hUnd, called " Suffer little children to come unto me."  But wot am wuss to me dan, dese tings, dat ole washerwoman dat mangles my shirts weekly, lef town Tuesday, wid my bess ruffle shirt, and I speck she will wear it at de nex con- wench on ob Woman Rights. Dese womans all want to be Captains, when ole Human Nature formed em spressly for mates !--When a sailor cap- tain ships a mate, he ships a mate, he dont ship a captain. Dere can't be two captains abord one clam sloop ; and if de mate fools around de captain and tries to boss it obber him, de captain am jis as sure to lam him ober de head as I am to hab de rumatism afore de nex storm., Defore, you see if a woman ships on board ob de canal boat Matrimoney as% de help-mate ob de captain, she must be content to be mate, and help de captain, or else she'll find. de debil's own trowble in de caboose house. Tings hab stood dis way ebber sense de year one, when Adam wore jacket and trowsers, and so dey will stan as long as de sun shines on the lofty Benjaman Loman's hills of Skotland. Talk 'bout de Woman's Rights ! why, dey hab more rights now den dey noe wot to do wid ; and wot few she aint got, she takes. I pity some ob dem poor fellers dat tout dey marred angels, jis as ef, ennybody ebber seed a shemale angel in de pictur' books I I don't belebe   WOMAN'S RIGHTS.                221 dar am eny shemale angels in dis world; dey'm all he fellers.           - Some men spile der wvifes by bein' intirely too sweet to dem, when dey fust git married, pettin' dem up wid sugar plums amnd sich tings, and lettin dem hab ebberyting dere own way for a while an den try to fite it out ob dem de second clous ob de fust year.

I go in for gittin married.

"UXURIOUS LAZARETTOS- IN de lass. clows ob my lass lectur, I sed ef enny ob my congregashun wished me to lectur on enny perpendickler subjick, to send it in to me, and 'cordinly I recebe dis pistol from some well-meanin brudder ;- "Mr. Hanabel-Please lectern of the word, ' Search de Scripturs,' and ef you have a mind to, you may do much good among your thousands of. readers. "AN ADMRER." Now, my frens, Mr. Admirer seems, like a good menny odder folks, not to understand me or my mission, at all. Frum de fast to de last, during de four years dat I hab lectured to you, I hab nebber meddled wid religous sub- jicks, or intended in any way to burlesque religion, or eben to speak light ob it; but der am hardly a week passed during dat time I had not been 'quested to lectur frum sum tex pinted out to me in de good book ; but I hab nebber done so, as I do not claim to be a preecher man, but a compounder ob all de siances in dis sorcumlambular world; but it may not be a miss to relate hear a suckumstance dat 'cur in consequence ob sarchin de ^cripturs, in de back woods, which am sed to be a fac. When dat good man, who spent a long life in doin good to he feller man, Lorenzo Dow, was trabblin in de west- ern hemisfere, he stopped at de house ob a squatter, and.   THE RESULT OF DILIGENCE.     223 found de hole family, consistin ob lebin children, in great tribulashun and trouble. Now wat you tink it was dat trouble dein so much? Wus it an oneasy conshunce? No! it wus fur de loss of de fine toof comb. Now de loss ob a fine toof comb to one ob us in de city, whar sich luxeries surrund us on ebbery side, am nofin, kase we kan git one:at enny minit ; but de loss ob de only one in de house in de back woods, whar it am ten miles to de nearest store, am a greviance dat am sure to lead to numerous consequences- too newmerous to menshun. De old lady sed, her and de children had searched de house all ober far it, and scratched in ebbery corner but no comb cood be-found. De ole man i I had scratched, she had scratched, de children had all scratch- ed, .up stairs and doun stairs, but it was ob no use. -"How long hab it been lost?" axed de pias Lorenzo. "'Bout free monfs,Y answered de ole lady ;." and de only / comfort I hab in de hour ob trial am a readin de Bible." "Do you read it often?" axed Massa Dow. "Yes indeed!" sed she; " mornin an nite." You see she node Lorenzo, an wanted to git in his good graces, an derefore humbugged him a little. "I is- glad to hear it," sed the good man, " for it am de rock on which all mankind may rely in safty. But I tink ef you stigmatize a thorough inquiry about dat comb, it cood be found. Let me interefy de children 'bout it, and see what can be solicited."  So he went to de old man fast, and axed him, He sed he dident noe notin 'bout it, nor dident car; he nebber trubbled his'hed wid none ob de fashunable tings, and he nebber re- collected using a comb in he life. He wus sassagefied to luff he har be as natur made it, and looked 'pon dis combin ob de har as bein 'tirely superdickilas. Den Dow went to de oldest son, who told him he dident noe   224        BLACK DIAMONDS. - whar de cussed ting wus, nor dident want to. He tried it once in his har 'bout two years afore, but it hurt him like thunder, and dat wus 'nuff fur him. H-e sed he wus glad it wus lost, fur ebber since it cam in de house de children had a cryin spell once a monf when de old woman got at their heds; but now it wus lost an dere wus piece in de house. De children wus den questioned, one by one, but no light troun 'pon de subjick. Dey all 'pared glad dat it was lost so de search wus gibben up but de scratch continued. Durin de ebenin, Brudder Dow talked to dem 'bout sarch- in Ae scripturs and de old lady sed she always did, and per- tended to be too good to last long. When bed-time cum, he axed fur de Bible, and purposed reading a chapter to dem. So dey reached doun de good book frumn off a hie shelf, and found dust 'nuff on it to write " damnation" on all ober, and when he opened it, out fell de fine toof comb dat had bin lost free monifs. De old lady wus dumbfoozled when she found she wus cotched in a lie, but she owned up and promised henceforth to sarch de Bible, spechaily when enny ting wus lost. ? Some ob dis congregashun might find somefin by sarchin de good book. Maby a lost consience might 'be restored, which cannot be in any odder way. I hab bin axed what cured my black eye; I will tell you. I hab a great deel ob trouble 'bout it. Some body told me to use raw oysters-I did, and I eat more den haffa bushel, but dident do;any eye no good. Den I use Muxtang Line- ment and raw clams,. and dat fotched it all rite.

A feller hab got to hab de intelleck ob de elemfint to keep heseff posted, widout temptin to exasparate odders by his nolege ob de times. But I'll cast a few reflecshuns on de 1   EARLY SETTLEMENT OF NEW YORK.     231 past, as de lookin glass sed to de ole maid, consarning dis New York, which am now Is large a burgh as any in de country 'round.  In takin a prospective view backwards at dis Toun, eben in my day, leads a man to tink he am in R/usha, by de way tings am rushed tru in dis fast age. Ebbery ting am fast now. No old slow coaches can git 'long for dem locomoko- focotive bullgines. De sloops and skooners in de ribbers am all in de way ob de steembotes, and ebberybody seems detarmined to lib fibe or six years in one-but dem fellers dat lib fast, die in de same manner, and here am where de laff cums in by de undertaker. Natural History sez dat de Dutch fust settled dis Iland. But history don't say how much dey settled it, but I don't beleve dat ef all de Dutch in de world, filled to de chin, wid sour-crout and lager-beer, wus to cum here, dey cood settle it more den a inck or an inch-and-a-haff Abby De Poise wait.  I tink dere muss be sum mistake in history 'bout dis, or else de feller dat rote it dident noe how high de Iland stood afore it wus settled. Wken de Dutch landed here, dey found de natibs bizzy a roastiu furriners, and frum de way de tribes belongin to de press club (dis club will break dere  own beds yet), hab roasted Thackery, de English gemmen, dat wus sent for to swamp me by lecturin against me in opposishun to me my- seff.  I say from de nice manner in which dey hab roasted him, Htink dey keep up de practice ob roastin furrilners til dis day.  But sibilization hab done wonders for dis Iland- kase when de Dutch fuss cum dere wus only one rum and beer shop on de hole Iland, and dat was kept by de old Gubner heseff-and look how Sibilizashun hab stretched he influential arm, and see rum-shops and lagrer-beer cellars all round.  Where dere wus one in dem days, dere am forty \   -       232   /     BLACK DIAMONDS. tousand now, to say notin ob de Dutch grocerys on ebbery corner, whar spiritual knockins am so offin herd. It wus 'mong dese Dutehmans dat New Years kalls wus fust in- vented. Dey used to make hot-stuff out ob Santa Cruise rum, hot water, little butter, and plenty alspice, and de way dat hot stuff used to fly wid de krullers doun de troats ob dem fellers atwene de Dutch words dey wood spit, out wus arcaushum to de risin ginerashuu ob de day. Den dis place wus kalled Rotterdam, but old Justice Von Slockeim- himer sed it wus too much like English swarin, an dey alter- ed de name to Manhaton, for shortness. Tilogs am changed wonderfully sence den. Whar de Ixngin used to cam ober frum Long Island in he kanoo, to steal de Dutchman's slieep and ruin, now runs de steembote, de canal-bote, and de clain-bote. De ribber dat wus so full ob all kinds ob fishes, dat dey used to curm to de beech to be kotched ef de fisher- men whistled for dem, amn now plowed by de mighty steam- ships dat run 'twene here and todder side ob Jorden. Eberyting am steam now-a-days, and de folks am not kon- tent to hablit on der railroads in de out-squirts ob de city, but dey am gwane to hab a rail-rode doun Broadway, and in a few short time you will heer de bullgine snortin frum de Battery to 911th street like a mad bull in fly-time. Den, my frens, look out for your heels; sum ob dem I noe am big 'nuff to upset de hole train, but don't try it; 'spere- ments am sed to be dangerous by de oldest foolosefers. You may trow 'em off de track widout injury to yourseffs, by layin your heds on de track, but don't fool wid your heels.

And wat for? I ax you. Why, I'll tell you wat for-gis to try to run your old friend and Benjaminfactor, me myseff, off ob de track; but its no use, dey might as well try to dam Niagaree wid a hay-riggin, as to scar dis chile. Here I'll stand as firm as a Jersey bank, and as unchangeable as a counterfit silver dollar bill, regard- less ob all consumstances. I is gwane to liten your conqhePce dis ebenin on de Gogrofee Siance, and spoke to you consarnin de Iland ob JAPAN. Japan, my frens, am siterwated a good ways off from Cony Iland, clar away ober todder side ob Jordan. It am   234        BLACK DIAMONDS. summer time all de'year round dar ; subequently dey neber hab no Christmas nor no New Years, kase dey ain't no winter time to hab 'em come in, like us blessed mortals. Japan amtwhar all de Japan candlesticks, Japan lamps, and de sasspans cum frum: . De Japanonians amn just de culer ob a Japan candlestick, and I speck dey culer dem by rubbin de perspiration dat comes frum dere faces while dey am a making( dem, on de same, which fully 'counts for de perculier culler. Dey am an industriously lazy set, full ob idolitry and dirt. Dey hab always looked 'pon de Yankes as a bery unsartin set ob fellers 'cordin to de Almanack, and dey won't trade wid dem a tall, kase dey had hurd ob de wooden megnutrwooden cow-cumbers, and wooden punkin End water milluns seed, and dey am afeerd ob gittin stuck.. Now, ef dere am ennyting in dis world dat will brake a Yankee's hart, it am to be fooled in making a trade, eder nashonly or indiwidually. Derefore, old TUnkle Sam talked wid Massa Foolmore de Presemhdent, and 'eluded to send a few notions out dar to try to 'fluence trade. He speck to loose a little on de fust cargo and make it up on de last. I don't zackly noe gis wat he sent out, but I speck its de useal rumn and 'batco. I tink dey'd hab done better ef dey'd a sent a cargo ob Sourkrout, made of Massa Wan Buren's cabbages; kase I speck dey noe all 'bout dat luxury, as dey trade only wid de Dutch nashun, and dats 'bout all de Dutch deals in, 'septin Dutch clocks, music boxes, hand- organs and gin.  I gess Unkle Samevil will dribe a stiff trade wid dem. He hab sent a hole fleet full ob bum-shells, cannon-balls and cutlashes, and dey kan eder take de beau- ful bargins he hab sent dem, or dey kan git Ricked jist as dey like.  Ef dey show shy on a trade, de Kom modore will gis read one ob Capt. Coggy's Forf ob July orashuns to dem, and ef dat don't fetch 'em, dey got to be bum'd for sartin.   ON JAPAN.          235 Dere ain't much nown Jbout de habits and customs ob de natib Japanonions as yet, kase dey hab kep all deir siance locked up in deir cubberd in one corner ob de globe out ob site, but Unkle Sam will open de do' and luff de world see all dere Japan ware. It am sposed dat dey hab a habit ob eatin like de cullerd man, and in all probembility dey do sumn few sleepin during de twenty-four hours aloted to mankind. I told you dat it wus summer all de time dar. Dat, my frens, am all owing to de klimate. I wish we hab sich a klimate heer' in de winter time. It wood sabe cole. Sum folks hab a knack ob sabin cole eben in dis cold region, and dat, too, when de jimbometer am below freezes. I noe, my frens, dat it struck your understandins mity cold heer on last lectur nite, and ef you will wind up your recolleckshun apperatisus, you will remember dat I spoke 'bout its bein so cold as niely to friz my fingers and toes, and I promised to 'zamin into de state ob our cole basket-and now I must 'form you ob one ob de most diabolicoal swindells on dis congrefgashun, dat yon eber heer ob.    .   .  You all noe dat we hab chipped up money heer ebery week for cole ; but we hab been fool'd, and dat money hab bin nocked doun and spent for clam-soup by dat rutnyvgate, Bill Nubbins, de sexton and undertaker. Wat makes him an undertaker, am de fac, dat he undertook to keep dis room clean and make de fires for two shillins a week, but he hab not done it no how. You all seed, as you tort, a fire in de stobe ebery ,nite, and I noticed dat sum ob de bredderin and  sistern hab went to de stobe to warm dere shins, anld I tort cum away sassagefied, but my frens dar wus not no' fire dar-dat red' wat look like fire in de stobe wus notin but a piece ob red flamel wid a Japan lamp ahind it to make it look like fire. Dis ni.,gerism wus perpetrated by dat orful bad darkey who hab libe-d off ob de bounty land ob dis con-   236         BLACK DIAMONDS. gregashun. Derefore, I pint Brudder Sam Peialhpep as de sexton hensefort, in de place ob Bill Nubbins, and de lexshun must take place for do same. Dat red fla nmel fire am like lde lurements ob de old Bellzebub. He hold out a false lite to fotch sinners to de warm place.

De words ob de tex am dese- Professor J. C. Hannibal--Will you please tell us in your next lecture, what color our first parents, Adam and Eve, were. It has been an undecided question since the commelncemcat of the world, and we now look to you as a man of siance and wisdom, to settle the point for all future generations. Yours, in doubt, "ONE OF YOUR CONGREGATION." I muss admit dat I wus hiely flattered when I git dis note,   A LONG DISPTED POINT FULLY SETTLED.   23B kase it shows dat I'm considered sum punkins in de field ob siance -and as I rolled back in my arm cheer arter readin de pistol, I inwardly xclaimed, whars Tom Hyer, or Yankey Sullivan, now? Whars Henry Ward Beecher? Whars Horace Greeley? Whars Capt. Cogy? Whars Gen. Jones? Whars your Ben Franklins? Whars your New- ton Isaacs? Whars all de rest ob de foolosefers ob'de past and precedin times, dat dey muss cum to dis old chile when enny pint ob refulgent 'portance hab to be settled. Dere am, I is sorry to say, a difference ob 'pinion regardin my 'bility to settle pints, kase dat old Dutchman nex to Anty Clawson's woodent trust me for a pint ob lager-beer last nite, and gub as a reason dat I had not settled de last pint dat I owed for. But dat aint notin to do wid de subjick. De question am, what color wus Mr. Adam and Mrs. Adams?  Her maiden name wus Eve afore she becum Adamn's wife. We don't larn in Nateral History what Mr. Adam's fust name wus, but I 'speck it wus John, or Ben, or Efrum, or sum ob dem names dat git, in Congress. Dere hab bin a good menny foolosefers 'tempted to 'splain de color ob dese two pepil. Old Sambo Carson, who wus a sound preech- ernian (most all sound), ses dat Adam and Eve was de two fast black men, and dat Cain and Able wus de second best  -dat Cain and Able wus boff butchers-one wus a killer ob de ground, andde odder wus a killer ob de sheep-derefore dey wus " mutton butchers." Now, my ignumrant frens, I warn you aginst sich doc- trine as dat, kase ef dey was all black, whar in de land ob de liben did de wite trash cum frum-and ef on de odder hand dey wus boff wite, whar did de darkey cum frum-  and ef one, edder Mr. Adam or Mrs. Adam war black, and de odder wite, dere decendants wood hab bin a kind ob wheat and ingin pepper and' salt cullered comn-   238        BLACK DIAMONDS.      munity-derefore you see as plain as you can see an iceberg in de moon-light, dat dey muss hab bii edder de one or de odder, black or wite. I is kinder 'elined to de idia dat dey wus boff black-den ob course you want to noe whar de wite man :cum frum. Well, I 'splain dat as clar as a brass button atwene a dar- key's lips. tey cum frum de Isle ob Wite, whar de fust dar- keys mass hab gone and got bleeched. Dere am no denien de fac dat de folks born on de Isle ob Wite am wite folks, and enny fool kin tell you dat. Dis muss be de true origi- nal origin ob de wite man, kase ef Adam and Eve wus wite in de beginnin, whar did de darkey spring frum? I don't 'lude here to de darkey I seed spring out ob de second story winder at sister Jane Ann Plimins todder nite, when old Pli- mins cum home radder onxpeckedly frum Long Iland, kase dat arn't got notin to do wid de kase, I meen whar did de fust black man spring frum? Why, you poor sinners, deres no noein-ef dey wasent black in de fust place, kase dere am no He ob Black mentioned in de Almanack far dem to go to git black at. True, dey mite cum pretty neer it by going to Japan and gittin Japanned all ober-but den dey wood be only copper-colored like a copper tea-kettle. I sumtimes tink dat maby Adam mout hab bin-a blue man (kase you noe dat men hab a great propensaty for getting so),and Ebe a yeller woman-fur by mixin dese two cullers togedder when you mix de wall wash, you will hab a beau- ful green, and de lord nose dat dar am a great menny green ones 'mong mankind ginerally. Derefbre, I consider de pint settled, and you may applaud as much as you like, at de 'portant decision ob de kase.          , De sexton hab just handed me anudder billyduck wid anudder inquest frum Brudder Blockhed.

Dere am a great difference atwene a saw-mill now and what dey nsed to wus. It used to be dat de wood wus brought tode mill, but de march ob probement now marches off de mill to de wood.

You had hurd ob de feller dat died and made no. sign. Well, dat chap coodent a bin edd er a sign-painter or a biz- ness man, or else he'd a made sum kind ob a sign afore he died, ef only a larger beer sign wid- a cork-screw on it. America am a nashun ob signs-ef a man hab got only two :emons and free decanters in he window, and a quart ob rum on he sheff, he am sure to git a sign clar across he house, wid sum mity big name fpainted bn it, wid Washing- ton in de middle, Napoleon Bonypart on .ona end and Andrew Jackson on de odder. De signs ob de times all look upwards. Ebery body am gwane up toun 'mong de Irishtockracy. De lower part ob de sity ain't worf libin in no more. De pepil all mobing out ob it, and now de churches am all gwane up dere, too, so dat putty soon de doun toun abdoreens will be widout de benefit ob de clurgy. I may hab to go up myseff afore long --deres no noein. Tings hab went up to-day dat didn't tink ob it yesterday. Deres Bill Lucky, put his coat up (to spout), and Dan Honestface hab bin sent up to Black- well's Iland, and dere am no noeiri who may go up next- tings look mity omnibus 'round dese diggins. It arn't considered suspectable to lib dis side ob fifty-ninf 'treet no more-derefore I tink we better fUller de tide ob minagrashun, and jump 'bord de big scow ob " speckula- shun," and go up wid de rest.

Signs am bery deceibin. I'll tell you a nanagote 'bout a sign, which I heer some time ago, in order to probe my insertion. Dere was once on a time, dat a man up set de hide-buzi- ness down in de swamp (dere hab bin a good menny swamped round dar, and dats why dey name it swamp), and wen he opened shop he dident noe 'wat kind ob a sign to git dat wood be different frum all de rest ob his nabors-so de tort struck him (dese fellers will strike pepil sometimes, and de lied generally kotches it fust), dat as his name was Tailer, lie wood bore a hole in de front door, and put a caff's tail in it, and de letters 0. R. at de side, so it wood read tail-or, and besides be an insignificance to de passer, dat he sold hide and leder. Well, he opened shop and he hadent bin open more den free weeks, afore a customer cum, 'dat am her tort he 'was a customer, and I 'speck he wus, and mity green one at dat, frum de country.  He fust distracted de 'tention ob de man ob de shop, by bein seen by him a-walkin up and doun in front ob de store, wid he eye on de tail all de time. Now-and den he wood stop and handle do tail, and seemed as if wanted 'to play wid it. Once he wus seen- to take a rule out ob he pocket and nmeasure de size ob de hole and de tail, and Mr. Tailor opened de do' and-axed him ef he wus lookin fur hides. "No, sir," sed de countryman. "I wasent in want of ennything in that line, but I wus foolosifizein on dat caff's tail in dat hole." "Well," ax Mr. Tailor, "do you see ennything berry strange 'bout dat?" "Well, yes," returned the man. "I wus trying to make "   242        BLACK DIAMONDS. out how on arf a caff cood git his body through dat little hole, and not git his tail in." So you see by dis simple caffs tail, dat signg am bery deceibin. Derefore, trust not to dem. You often see tings in front ob shops dat am not ment fur signs. I heer dat a drunkin feller wus found layin on a tabern stoop, fass asleep, and a man stuck he hbed in do' and told de tabern keeper dat he sign had blown doun, arid wus layin on he stoop- dts anudder instance ob not understanding signs. De signs ob de present time am all gold-gold-gold. Eberybody am arter it, and de pepil will reach so high to git it, dat I am affraid dat de speckelashuns will fall to de ground, and de price ob white-wasbin fall wid it. Look Out, my frens, how you read de signs ob de times. Dere will be a colleckshun taken up dis ebenin to pay my washwoman, and backer bill, and to send a mishonary to Congress to sibilize de members.

When dey don't stuff wid cotton, dey use demn little double-brested scoop nets what you see in de winders in Broadway, in de cosdet shops. But do de sisters use false pretences in order to hum- bug de odder sex enny more den de dandy does to swell tip he own figur-fur ef hunman natur had made enny ob derm wid de deformed chists, dat sum ob dem carry, dey wood consider demseffs a damaged piece ob mortality, and wood be a runnin to de doctor man to git cured-and agin, ef natur 'flicted a man wid a red head, and a beard haff as black dey culler it, he wood be considered a curiosity fit to hab a star engagement at de Museum.

Ef we do we will get mity taken in, now mind I tell you. We are more apt to trust to 'perences in our young days, den we is arter we git our eye-teef cut. I noe a little darkey dat wus beaufully sucked in by a lookin-glass once. His farder-and mudder lib in a back country, on a cotton plantashon, and de little feller hab neber seen a lookin glass in he life, but he hab seen a monkey fast to an organ d'at cam fru dar once, fast to an Italion. Well, one day de farder ob de boy went to toun and bied a glass, and put it in de bottom ob he trunk. When he cum home, de little darkey opened de trunk cub- ber, looked in, and shut it doun agin-quick as lightuin, and jumped to his feet and slapped his hands, and sung out, "I'm glad! I'm glad I fadder hab brought home a monkey, alid I is gwane to play wid it." So you see what it am to truest to 'pearances.' But I belebe it am born in us to wish to seem what we am not. Little boys am ginerly born wid der fists doubled up to make de nuss tink he had cum fur a pugalistic fite, when he am noffin but a feeble sucker, who looks 'pon de eye ob he mudder, as de moon, and her mouf as de gateway ob heaben.

DOSELITES- * As it am well none 1py de world ginerly, and dis con- gregashun in partickler, dat I hab bin doun to de Capitol ob de Nashun, and seed de 'Naugerashun ob Massa Pierce, I 'spose it am spected dat I should liten your intelecks on wat I seed and herd in dat city of polushun, politicks, big streets and big taberns. Derefore I shall, like all odder great trabelers, gub you a few notes (not bank notes), I took on de journey. Massa Fuller, Massa Willis, Massa Bryant, am all ritein to de noosepapers what dey see- derefore, I do de same. On de Wensday, mornin afore de 'naugerashun, I took de cars, or redder de car took me frum Jersey City to Filem- endelfy. De pepil wus bery perlite to me, and I .only had my hat nocked. doun ober my eyes tree times 'durin de hole passage. I dident car fur de hat, but my wardrobe and wooden comb wus in it, and my todder shirt got mussed. Nobody cood tell what I was gwane to Washinton for, and dey kept axin me ebery now and denf ef I wus spectin an office, and one feller, dat opens oysters in Fulton Market when he'm at home, behind a pair of cullard mostachoes, said he wus well 'quainted wid Gineral Pierce, and ef I'd gub him fibe dollars, he wood secure me a posishun as Ram- bassender to Coney Iland, whar I cood git my fill ob clams, at de xpence ob de Post Office. I tort it wus a putty good   I   I I I*   i I   A TRIP TO   I49   offer, but I beat him doun to free dollars, and he 'greed to git me dat office, as he sed dat wus de only office wacant fur a cullerd man. Wen I got to Filenniidelpha I looked all ober fur de mustasloed feller, but coodent 'finld him no whar, no how- but ef eber I do lay my outraged haus onl him, hell smell, sumfin like Bunker Hill, I'll bet a brickbat against his lied. De comduckter on de Baltimore track made me git in de car' whlar d( geinmon's l-uggage wus, and I laid nmy lied on somebody's police, de contents of whichl, acted on iue like a (dose of ludlum, and I fell asleep till de depot ribed at W. ashington. Wen we got dar, 1 found de police belonged to a sertain editor, and wus fillId wid his weekly papers. Dey husseled me out ob de cars wid do rest ob de baggagc, and I commenced to hunt up a place to sleep. I speckted to find, a crowd ob darkeys at de car-house' wid bangers and music, to scorch ine up to de touri, but not a darkey node me, and I wus compelled to sleep at lass (dere beiii no odder place in de toui), on a hepe ob shawenis, under de steps ob de Capitol. In'de nite a snow-storm coil e on, and I kotched sich a cold dat I dident noe wlAar to git brake- fast. As I scratched out friim my sleepin place, and brush- ed de shawins out ob my lar and close, I amet Massa Toml Benton, a strutin doun de walk in a deep revelly ; no dout. cogetatin in he own mind, wedder he made de Almity, or de Almity made lim-and wedder he honored de Senate House or de Senamite House him. In a miniite Gen. Cass cum along readin de Picayune, and a lookin a little grum, as ef he seed sonfin he dident like. Putty soon de pepil begin to gedder round de Capitol, in front ob de big platform, and a feller wid a paper ob to- bacco in his mouf, told me to be a mobin, dat he dident like to see darkeys a strolin round de Capitol, so I took up my "*    250-        BLACK DIAMENiDS. line ob march to de rofunder, in de middle ob de house, whar all de pictures am 'bout Gein. Washington. I found de floor moss an inch deep wid tobacco spit, and here again I was told to mobe on, but I 'termined to see de Nautgera- shun, so I left de primices and got a pail ob water in my hand and a tin cup, and I went in high and dry on de tem- perance principal, behind a soger company, pretendin to gub de sogers drink, and de sogers wood hab liked it fuss rate ef dere had only bin brandy mixed in wid it. It was a snowin all de time dat TMassa Pierce wus gittin bored wid de augerashun, and eberybody sed it wus 'bout as Pierce-in a day as wus eber none in dat part ob de climate. I seed de hole proceedins, frum peginin to end, and I'll bet all de money dat cums in de sa/kser-to-nite, dat Massa Pierce habs his own way 'bout tings in general. Old Massa Fillmnore rided in de carrage/ id him, wid a face as lnild and sweet as de fust blush ob a Rorin Borin Alas, oil de fust dew-drops ob de mornin--feelin, no doet, pelfeck- ly sassagefied dat he had done his duty.  Ef he ain't sassagefied ob de fac heseff, de pepil am, and dats lnuff. De darkey poelashhun ob Washington 'woodent suasheatte wil me, and troad it up to me dat I wus a poor fice nigger, *and dident belong to nobody, and I wus too low fur delm to mix wid. 'Siety 'mong de cullerd folks am berry good in Washington. A rambassender's or a Fnr-on Counsellor's darky won't suasheafe wid a Congress-man's waiter no liow, Alnd fur my part, I like de Norf de bess, kase hlere de darky kan be as sassy as de wite trash, and be suspected gis de same. Derefore, I is glad to git back, fur I ain't seen you since I don't care when, and I feel as glad as ef I'd found a cleanl sirt, and I cood slake all bob your corn-stealers at bncc.

"AMBASHUS SINNERS- IT is my 'tent and purpos to say a few wurds to you 'bout old times and new times, compare de past wid de pre- ceedin, and de comin times wid de futur, and see de differ- ence, or in odder wurds, I shall spoke to you on de INOAWSHUNS OB DE AGE. Who am dere 'monsg dis big crowd dat don't recomlect old times? Maybe sum kin go farder back den odders. I nebber node an old darkey in my life, eder hemale or she- male, that hadent held Gen. Washington on dere nee and nussed him like a baby-but I aint none ob dese-I don't date back so fur, but I go a good ways in the rear of time notwithstandin-and wat wus considered sum punkins in my young days am now looked 'pon as old fogyism. I don't 'zactly noe de menin ob old fogy, but I will send an inquiry to Massa: Cass, as dey say he noes de critter like a catakissim. Wen I wus young, de old ladies in de parlor used to take delite in nitten stockins-dat day am passed, kase dey got a mechine fur doin it now. In dem days it WUs pat ob a   BLACK DIAMONDS. wife's duty to make .her husband's shirts, but tain't so no more-dere's a sewin mechine fur doin dit, t:)c. Ti'owsers den used to be made by hand, bat now dey gis stick a piece ob cloff in a mechine and turn a crank, and out cums as menny reddy made cloze as wood supply an army ob soger mans. I kin recumleck wen de stage-coach used to kick up a dust tru de country towns, and blow a fish horn to make de children git out ob de way ; but now de old mity steam bullgine cums rattlin fru'dese places in iron harness, a snortin like old Beizebub when he's arter an Alderman. Ebery ting seems tnrned upside doun. Eben de ladies slebes, fur dey used to wear dem big at de shoulder and mity tight at de hand, now its tight up dar and big at de rist-and de gemmonh hub cut all da tail off ob der courts and put it in de slebes ob de same, till dey look as ef dey had der arms in der trowsers. Folks don't hab to work no more now, de wash board am done away wid, and all washin am done wid der mechine. Dere ain't no soap required no more neder ; cloze am washed' wid washin-fluids, and wile de lady ob de house am playin de forty pianos in de parlor, de washin am bein done by steem- in de kitchen. Dis is de age ob mechines and new invenshuns. De old Hoss pistol hab had to gab way to de Colt's revolwer, and de young fellers am riden ruff shod ober us old cusses, and we can't do nofin but holler. I heer ob new tings starting up ebery day, and soon you will see mechines for openin clams and skinen eels. More den one haff ob de public offices am turned into skinen mechines to skin de pepil, and dey do it most :fectally, and I speck de nex-ting I noe you will hab a mechine to lectur to you ebery week in place ob me, kase you tink it will work fur less wages. I tink it needs a mechine ob sum   OLD TIMES AND NEW.    253   kind to furnish lecturs fresh and original ebery week, fur I feel dis old tinkin apperatus in my iiol'ge box almoss worn out, and putty soon it must be laid up wid doress ob de old lumber-but wile I is able to wag my tongue, you shall heer de truffs ob siance as strait as a crowhar, and as solid as a drunkard's oath. Mechines am rot always found to be good --suinbody wus fool 'nuff to construck one dat wood clean de treets inl no time, afore de sun rubbed de dust out ob he eyes in de mornin, but it wus soon scubbered dat it woo'dent do, bekase it coodent wote, and it wus cast aside like a milky potater. What a blessin it wood be ef sum kute Yankee wood inwent a mechine far xtractin lies out ob newspapers, and currupshun out ob de politishuns, and at de same time inject a little charity into de harts ob all misers and fanat- icks, but sich hallelujah times as dem will nebber cum wile dis old sheep's head ob mine am bleating on arf-but de time will cum, you rebelous scorpians, when mankind will be looked 'pon as bein as good as ennybody, and womankind a good deal better. Den de belignent wings ob siance will sore above de equinotail line ob bliss, and all creashun stand agap and gaze in putrified amazement on genus and humau natur. Whoeber libs to see dat day, will find dat 'siance will still march magestickly on, like a lazy darkey to de cot- ten field-all de fundimental equilibrum will be consentra- ted in one wast epox or small pox, it won't make egny difference which, and de shout ob wictory will go for ke de sound ob a woman's tongue in mobin-time.  :e Wid dese reflecshuns I send round de sasser by Brudder Emanuel Laboer Johnson, and I hope you won't be so cussed stingy as you wus lass week.

I ain't got much to say to you dis time, derefore it won't take me more dan a week to say it-but wat I got to spit out, am de truff, so I don't car who nose it. I'm as independent as ain Irish woter on Lexshun Day, and as impudent as a lawyer to a shemale witness. I'm as sassy as a bumble bee, and I feel as big as an oberfed bullefant. I'm a gwane to talk strait fours to you, kase I like to do it.

I specked to see dem dressed to deff in tree cents worf ob red paint and a tommyhawk, and de wimon in ear-rings, nose rings, and a string ot beeds, like de ingin folks, but no! dey hab five-dollar suits on all round. It seemed fi'um de way dere cloze fit dem, dat dey all muss sleep in one mity big room, and all xchange cloze ebery- mornin, fur I didcnt see one dat dident look as f he wore his close fru compulshul, and not fruln choiie. De boys all had on der daddlys coats, and der daddys all 'peared to hab on de boys trowserloons. I'msassagefied dat de musshuna- ries hab bin sent 'ntong den, kase I heard one ob de natibs sware ka se aniudder gis happen to -let a barrel ob pork rool on he foot and skuash it a little. I was berry anxious to find out all I cood 'bout de koun- try whle I was in it, ald once when de rail-rode stop, I stick my head out ob de depot, and I ax a feller in cow skin boots, which boots wus up to de middle pb de leg in mud, dese questions, and got dese ansers- "Wat kountry am dis?" "Tain't no kountry-it's Jersey." "Wat's de produxshun ob de sile?" "Red mud, rail-rodes, ingin-rubber shoes, jack-asses, and State-Prisons.." "Why what do you lib on?"

"Oh, you must hab odder tings besides dese, or else you coodent lib. Can't you tink ob noffin else you raise here?" "1Oh, yes, plenty.

"t Oh, yes, sebrel married lass year, and two poor-houses hab been bilt dis season." I wus gis gwane to ax him his name, wen de old'iron hoss gub a snort and set us a flyin, but I seed a row ob yeller teef a grinnin at me as far as I cood see de man. Notwidstandin all dis, my frens, I tink Jersey a fast rate place fur a poor manf to die in. Dat feller wus a sour cuss, and I heerd afterwards, frum one ob de nabors, who got in de car while I wus spokein to him out ob de winder, dat lie wus so sour, dat de folks sent fur him fur miniles.'round, to cum and look in der pickel barrel, as his expreshun wood act on dem better den winegar.

Sumtimes de sickness am ended, and sumtimes de pashent, which am all de same, a hundred years frum now. In old times, in Spain and France-two countries away off furder den New Orleans-it used to be de custom fur de quack-doctors to ride on a he Jack-ass, and hab a man to blow a horn. Whenl de horn was blowd il de market place, de pepil semble round de ass and de doctor, and del he wood open he box, like de soap man on de team tates, and sell his stuffs, and de pepil at de same time-but now it am different. De quack-doctor uses de newspaper insted ob do Ass, and de editors dereof do de blowin. De man on de Ass used to colleck pennies and shillins, but de man dat rides on newsplaper popularity, collecks dollars insted, and all dis am owein to de 'provement ob de times, and de news received daily frum de spiritual world. We am now in de happy spring time, in de seson ob ten- tashun, fur I belebe it war in de spring time ob de world dat mudder Ebe temted farder Adam; but you fellers dat lib in de city don't noe nuffin 'bout de benine influenza ob de lubly spring. Ef you want to feel de spring in your nostrils, and wish to kick up-like a young colt in a clober lot or be as sportive as a pig jis broke out ob he pen, you muss go to de kountry which God made wid he 6wn hans, and git away frum de brick and mortar cities, which dat animal man projected, erected, and bilt fur heseff. How beauful am all tings in de kountry ob a spring mornin. Den you bar de lubly singin ob de cows, de sweet ba-ah ob de sheep, and de lowin ob sweet little birds as dey jump frum lim to lir, cotchin de dear little innocent worms, dat hab foolishy got up afore de birds.

Mobin day always wus de Forth ob July in New York fur de kolored people, and ef dey 'do smash and- break- tings, de gemmolls tinks it don't make no differenlce, kase de kolored folks am worth nothin, and dey can't get noffin frum dem-derefore I say unto you, blessed am dey dat ain't not got no furniture fur dey got little td get smashed in mobin ; blessed am denm dat am too poor to hire a house, fiur den dey got no rent to pay ; blessed am dey dat lib in one room, fur deh' dey aill't got de whole house to look arter ; blessed am dey dat ali't got notlidn to eat, fur dey won't be troubled wid de dyspep- tic ; blessed am de poor in pocket, fur dey ain't troubled wid Sudren and State money; and blessed am de sick, wid cnnyting but rumaticks, fur dey git'all de sweetmeats. Dis is de season when de little birds mate, alld d-- crows get. mlarried, and so does de elemphant. It am de time fur goillg, into partnership generally. Talking of partnership, brintgs to my mind sumtinrg dat [ kan't tink of; and while its in my recollecshun box, I'll jist tell it to you-its a story, and mite be called a na nedote. It happened when de kountry ob Jersey wasent bigger den a cow-yard, and de great big churches what you got now,   262        BLACK DIAXIONDS. mvasent biggeer dan a hen-coop; in fact, de kountry wus bery young. About de time menshuned in de lass clause, dere libed two old kolored men, one wus named Simon Strongt (who de folks used to call Strong Simon fur shortness), de odder's name wus Ben, his name wood hah bin Franklyn, but dey dident noe how to spell it--derefore, because de schoolmas- ter wusn't abroad, he wus robbed of he best name. Dese two old darkies went into partnership one May mornin, in- de wood chopin business. Dey got along fuss rate fur more dan a week, bul dere wus a suckemstance dat took place which colapsed de firm. Old Simon Strong had a great fashion ob gruntin, whenever he was chopin wood, he always (ruv a grunt like an old hog disturbed in a mud hole--dis use to make Ben laff, and he sed to (him- "Sinon, what males you grunt so ebery time you lhit de wood?' "Alh!" said Simon, leaning on he axe handle, "dat am a great mark ob strenf, Ben. When Goliah carried away de gates oh Jordon, he was herd to grnlt sixty miles round " "Well," says Ben, "I tink, you can strike jis as hlard a  blow widott gruttin, as you kan wid grultin."2 "I noe better," says Simon, " fur I hab tride it." "Well, I'll tell you what I'll do wid you," says Ben, "I'll bet you free cents dat you kan chop up haff a cord ob wood as quick, and let me do de gruutin, as if you grunted yourself." "Well," says Simon, "I'll take dat bet-How long does it ginerally take you to chop half a cord?" axed Simon. "About half a day." Well, de nex mornin, Simon commenced to cut de wood, wqle Ben sat0on a log and dbne de gruntin--it took hm all day till sun-down to chop de haff cord, and ob corse wun de   FIRST OF MAY -IN NEW YORK.     263 wager. Now ce troubble commenced in de firm-when Saturday nite cum, Simon woodent pay Ben he share fur cuttin de wood, because he said le dident do nothin towards it, but jis sat on a log all day and grunt. Dis make Ben bery mad, and on Monday mornin' he went and lade lhe complaint before de door ob a; Dutch Justice. De Justice listen to de complaint in all de specktacles and morning gown what he had. He sed he wood prosecute Simon fur bigimy, and send a konstable wid a suspician after him ; and after hearin de case, he wanted free weeks to gib a division ob de case. Durin dese free weeks, Simon and Ben wns lookin black at each odder, makin snoots and shakin fists at demseffs, wenober dey met. Bv-and-by de day cum for de division, and Squire Tunderbighed's cort-:room in he kitchen wus filled wid spec-tators and a few rotton punkins. Wen de lhour arrivetl, de Justice came in frum de cow yard, cob- ered wid dirt and dignity--de fuss wurd he axed wen lie sat down wus : "How much you got for shopin de wood?" "Twenty-five cents," says Simon. "Shilence!" sed de Justice, "dat is all I vant to noes." Den he took twenty-five pennies-out ob he pocket, and he tell Simon to cum on wun side and Ben on de odder; den he stand up, den he take wun ob de pennies and jingle it on de table, and he say to Ben- "Ben, did you heer dat jingle?" "Yes, sah!" said Ben. "Veil, den," says de Justice, "you kan take de jingle and gib Simon de monlish." And so he went; on -wid all de pennies, gubbin Ben de sound only; den de cort adjourned, and tread on a cat's tail, and you can do de same widout treadin on anybody's tail.                       BLACK DIAMONDS.

I node my money wasent in my udder close, kase I hadent no odder close fur de money to be in, derefore I wus sure on dat pint. I rushed back to de seller and axed Anty Clawson ef I had pade 'my bord fur de week, and sure 'nuff, she told me, "no indeed," and she wus a wonderin how I cum to go out de mornin arter lecture nite, afore I gub it to her, as I generly do.

Ef you hab fooled away de money, why don't you say so, and not try to lie out ob it. I tort you cum in late lass nite, but I dident say nofin, and I woodent hab sed nofin ef you hadent a tryed to cum dat old niggerism, dat old loossin game, ober me, gis at quarter day, too."

May be sum ob you don't noe de meanin ob de word eratic, derefore I stop on my way, like a milkman in de morn- in, and 'splain it to your understandin. Eratic meens to fly off de handle.  It am a Greek word, and cum ober here wid de Irish in an emigrant ship 'mong de rats. Ef you look back fur de lass few weeks, you will see dat I hab bin flyin off de handle; and insted ob my gubbin you Simon pure siance, I hab bin gubbin you a kind ob discourse ob my pussonal mobements; but dis ebening I trust to 'be more siantific den eber, and git a collecshun 'cordinly. You will find de words dat susspire me dis ebenin, in de Sam book, 29f page, fust claws ob de forty-toof werse-lbf page forty-toof werse. "Whip de debil round de stump, Ebery crack will make him jump I! Glory, glory, glory." What a blessed maginashun de poet dat penned dese lines muss hab had. De reder ob dem kan almoss see old Jimmy Squarfoot a rushin round a stump, closely followed by a fellow wid a sharp stick. But, my frens, you musent helebe all dat de poet say, or else you git in a Lunitic Hos-   268        BLACK DIAMONDS. pital afore you noe it. You derefore muss not belebe dat de ole he belzebub am green 'nuff to luff ennybody whip him pussonally round a stump. De ting am empossible, fur ef he wus to gis hit his, pussuer wid de tip ob he tail, eh! eh I he'd be a gone coon quicker den a snake could swaller a wood-chuck. I shall diwide my subjick in free parts-fustly we cum to de whip and de stump. Secondly we cum to de jump. Firdly we cum to glory. Fustly, den, I tell you plainly dere am a good menny ways ob whippin de debil round de stump. De desire to hit him a crack and make him jump, animate de brest ob all de human family, and eberybody am human family. Sum church people whip him in a good menny ways. Dey am doun on de freaters, bekase dey say dey am de debil's skool; but dese berry folks will take a front seat in de sa- loon in de Museum or at Niblo's Garden. Dey'd patronize de Serkis, and go to see dat big beast, de Hippodrome, wid- out de least cuimpunkshuns of konshunce, and dats one way to whip de debil round de stump--not dat I consider dese places sinful to wisit, put bekase I noe one freater to be gis de same as de todder one. De miser whips de debil round de stump all he life-he grinds de face ob de poor to hord up he nasty gold, and den he change off wid he lowness in de end, and de debil whip him round in de odder world. De sinner tinks he am berry cunnin, and -am whippin him round at a great rate, and keep him a hurryin up he kakes all de time-but in dis case de fun ob it am, de foot am on' de od- der boot, fur he am lashin dem like blazes all de time. Sum folks tink dey can cheat and lie in bizness and make stacks ob money, and den whip de debil round de stump by gubbin a large donashun to do Track Society, and git der 1"--    FLAT TRUTEIS.        269 name in de newspapers-but you'll see when your time cums, who'll. git made to fly round on dese stumps. I don't want you to tink dat I got any sympafy fur old horns and tail, kase I arn't. I wish sumbody would gub him a lickin, kase he deserves it, as I told a white brudder de odder day in de 'treet. De brudder cum up to me and shook hans, and sed he, "Professor, I hab read ebery one ob your lecturs in de Pic- ayune fur de lass two years and ober, and it really beats de debil how you kan keep dem up so characteristic and fresh."  I dident noe 'zackly what he meant, but I told him I was bery anxious to beat dat feller, and wood do it wid a club ef I cood, and den he laf at me. But I tell you what, frens, I 'tend to beat him in de end ef possible. I noe he am arter me like he am arter all de rest ob you, but I hope to dis- tance him at de end ob de race ob life, and de way I'm gwine to do it am dis-you kan all follow suit and git ahead ob me in de game ef you like. I am goin to be so. good and charitable to my nabor, dat old Squarfoot won't keep cum- pany wid me. He hates good folks, and ef I kan get a chance to lam him, ef I'don't I hope I won't get fifty cents in de sasser to-nite. Secondly-We cum to de crack and de jump, and I don't noe as I got much to say on dat pint. It am only a 'spres- sion ob de poet to gub force to de figure, but ef ever I git a crack at him wid a raw-hide, he'll see stars. I'll bet de ' new straw hat and summer doze what I speck you will gub me dis week, aginst dese old forlorn rags dat I got on now, dat I'll make him jump till he'd tink Hallumlujah day had cum for sartin, and he'd got to lebe.

It will bare   270        BLACK DIAMONDS tinkin ob afore goin to sleep-put all you can spare in de sasser and go home wid a lite\hart and pocket.

JULEOUS IDIA OF THE HPPODROME.^ SHEEP OB MY FOLD-- DE subjeck dat calls aloud for 'splanation dis ebenin, am one ob de most 'portant dat hab seized de intelect for a monff ob Sundays, and may be considered in de higher walks ob siance. I hab spent more time in lookin in de gogrofy and picture books to find out 'bout him den his hed's worf. I dont noe zacklywhat book to tell you to look for de tex in, kase I nebber seed de animal in enny ob de books I hunt for him; but I gess he am in Gold Smith's Anamatin His- tory ob de United States. De anamale I shall 'tempt to lucidate dis ebenin hab been a kicken up considerable ob a   JULEOUS' IDIA OF THE HPPODROME.   271 dust, ob late, in dis town, and I tink it am hie time dat I curried him down a little. De animale 'luded to am. DE HPPODROME. From all I hear 'bout dis beast, he must be a bully ob a animale. He am related on he mudder's side to de Drome family, and kinsequancely de Drome edary and de Bas-drum claim him as a member ob dere family. On he fadder's side he am related to de Hips. He am fust cusin to de Hip- popotamus, and brudder to de Hipocondrick, as nie as I can find out. I cant berry well 'splain his 'pearance to you, kase I nebber seed him alive, nor, as I just now sed, cood I find his dogsearotype likeness in enny ob de picture books or almanack, and I hab looked obber-more dan a hundred to find it, and set up amoss all nite a doin it. I hab seed de house dat he libs in dough, and I declar to you it am big as a norf ribber steembote. I was detarmand to see him, so dat I cood 'splain all de pints to you, and derefore, wid dat ontent, I went up to his house and ax de man at de doe if I cood go in and see de beast. "We got no place for colourd pepil in de house, and besides you'd only git fritened," sed de man. Derefore I had to go way, but my useal first for nolege woodent be fooled dat way, so I went round to de back door and peep in de crack at de-side, and dere I seed wonders. On one side stood a kitten Elem- fint-dat you noe am a young Elemfint-'bout. de size ob a hepe ob hair trunks. He was a eatin hay wid his nose or trunk, and while I was a lookin at him roll it up and stretch it out, like an Ingin rubber hose, I tort he'd make a fuss rate lawyer, kass he cood stick his nose so fur in odder folk's biziness. At fust I was puzzled to noe which was his frant or rear, kase at fast site I tort he had two tails, one at boff ends. I belebe dey stuff all de Elemfints wid hay while dey   2A2        BLACK DIAMONDS. lib and arter dey am ded, kase de one dey got in de Museum am stuffed wid it till you kin see it a stickin out ob de skin. On, de odder side stood a Camel, and dis poor feller had met wid de same axedent dat befel de odder one I seed in de animale show. He too hab had he back broke in two places, and nebber got it in shape agin. Dere am no noein zackly how dese fellers all git dere backs broke in dis way, but I 'spect its done in dere 'tempts to git fru de eye ob a needle. He looked in de face as if he fretted a good deal 'bout it. He looked almost broken-hearted, and stood chawin on his troubbles. He was tied wid a rope to a post, and he had tryde to git away till he had stretched his neck as long as a president's message. I nebber seed a Camel in his youth; dey all seem at least a hundred years old afore I see 'em, derefore I cant say much for de beauty ob dere countenance. While I was lookin in at him, and wonderin where human nature cood hab got de mould to run sich a feller in, a whole lot ob French gemmon come out ob de show shop into de place whar I was a lookin, on hoss-back. Dey war dressed up rale putty in jockey caps and red and yeller coats and trowsers, and dey war .berry polite to one a nudder, a bowin der heds and jabbern French like Satan, talkin 'bout Louis Nincompoop or Napolion, I dont noe which. Presently one ob dem seed me a lookin at him froo decrack, and I friteend him so he screemed like a pig wid a sore foot, and showed his beef all round. Dis fact drew de 'tention ob de man dat 'was tending to de critters, and he sung out to me, "Clar out, you ole darkey, and let dem Monkeys alone. He gub me sich a strong inwite to lebe, dat I tort it best to muzzle. Just as I turned to go, dey let out some ob de funnyest Gooses I ebber seed-dey was histed on legs dat wood make a Broadway dandy break his heart wid envy, during de rage ob tight pants. Dey steped   JULEOUS' IDIA OF THE HPPODROME.   213 out as graceful as an old cogger wid de gout on all his toes and de rumaticks in he 'nees. Dey was sich high-falutin fellers dat I ax a man dat come out ob de gate, what dey was named, and he told me Oyster horses. I speck de rea- sion dat dey call dem dat, am bekase dey use dem to tred il high water to sound de bottom for Oysters. I cant tink ob enny udder reason. Seein dat de man was so comunicatif, I ax him if de ole he big Hippodrome was in dar now. He sed yes, and dat ebbery time de ferry bell ring he started on a race wid some kind ob animale, edder de Elemfint, de Camel, de Charriots, or some odder critter. I ax him what dey fed him on, and he sed, Silver dollar bills, half dollars, and quarter dollars, and dey feed him twice a day ; in de arternoon and in de ebenin. Dats all I hab found oqt 'bout de Hippodrome as yet. If I find out enny more I'll let you noe. I'm bound to see him, if I. hab to whitewash my face and hands and play wite man, to git in. Dem summer clofe what I specked lass week didn't come yet, but I spose you tink dese I got bein full ob holes, am cool -nuff, kase dey am open worked. I shall speck new thin clofes notwithstandin nebber de less. Will Brudder Dove Plimkins please pass de useal sasser round, and be kerefull to give back no change.

Moss ob de trees dat blush in red and scarlet at de depar- ture ob May, hab thrown off dere gay and blushin blossoms, and seem to hab set to work in still arnist to see what dey can do far us poor dependant mortals by harbest time. De peach, de plumb, de'squince, and de apple trees, are all run- nin a race dis yeer to see who will produce de moss fruit, and it am hard to tell yet, which will beat.

Ef I was a clober top, in a field ob roseys, I'd neber hang my hed, kase I'd feel dat I wus as useful and as good as my neighbors, ef not as brilliant. It am -not always de moss beauful dat am de moss useful. It am good to feel humble, and to be humble sometimes, as de jackass sed when he undertook a race wid a stage boss. Now, my frens, I speck you am all cogitatin in your own mind, and wonderin, like Balam's ass, when he saw de angel, how I cood hab found out all de tings I hab bin a spokin to you about. Derefore, to sabe your fretted gizzards, I will tell you-I seed it all myseff. De odder mornin I got up wid old day-lite, and by de time de morning sun had wash- ed de-faces ob de clouds and took off dere nite caps, so dey showed dere golden heds, I wus in de kountry, away frum de dust, week coffee, and cod-fish kakes, ob de inornin in toun, and dere, all alone wid only myseff and human naturi to converse wid, I kept up an argement on de beauties ob dis world and de next, and when I looked around and see how much human natur hab done for dis world to make it lubly, and to see what a bountious supply ob all de neces- saries and luxuries ob life he sends to us all-to the wicked and de good, it makes me mad wid mankind to see dere stubborn ungratefulness, and I feel dat ef I wus human nature, I'd lather sum ob you like thunder sumtimes. De chaps dat kan eat de delicious strawherry, and tink only ob how much dey am worf a basket, or kan crouch doun de healf-gibin and luscious peach, wid no odder tort den dar  price by de haff peck, am not fit to hab sich tings. I'd like to lib in de kountry. I tink it am de only exis- '   276        BLACK DIAMONDS. tence God eber intended fur man, or else he woodent ha6 made it so lubly. Dis congregashun was gwane to buy me a place to lib in, and let me hab a parsnips like all de odder great professors ob de day, but whar am it I should like to know?

I WISH to hab a wurd to say to you 'bout a mity bad habit dat am bery prebelent 'mong de wite folks, and I'ze radder afeerd dat sum ob de colored pepil hab kotched it frum dem by bein in close contack wid dem. De habit I 'lude to am de practice ob L I E I N. Sum folks am born liars, odders pick it up in dere youth, like a hungry chicken does corn-odders agin lie in de way ob bizness, when ennyting am to be made by it-odders lie to try to make dem 'pear big in de eyes ob men, and odders lie bekase dey kan't help it. Dere am sebril kinds ob lies -de wite lies used by clergymen, earthly saints, and ladies -black lies, round lies-and den dere's a kind wat Shake- speare calls damned lies. Sum folks tink dat de rounder dey kan lie de smarter dey am, but dey'll git smartered wors den mustard plaster on a weak back, when old belzebub gits dem. Amature fishermen and gunners, indulge in de second "'class ob lies bery much. I neber node one yet dat dident cotch " de biggest fish you eber saw in your life, and more ob dem," in haff a day-and whoeber herd ob an amature sportsman dat dident kill from fibe to fifty on de wing at one shot? I neber did. A man afflicted wid constitushunal liein wood as lief take   "YING.          279 epicure 'nuff to make dem trow up a good dinner, as speek de truff. Deres noffin dat hurts dere feelins so much, and ef de truff slips out by axedent on enyting, dey am misera- ble all day. De darkeys hab a great fashun ob liein 'bout porgies and eels--ef you -meet one haff a block frum de market, you kan't tell no more what dey gub for dere fish, frum de sto- ries dey tell, den a foolosefer kan tell which way de grain ob a brick-bat runs wid his eyes' shut. Dem darkeys dat wish to 'pear rich, always pay an orful price, while dem fel- lers what want to git up a reputashun for bein cute and smart, always git them fur 'bout noffin. I noe dat de wite populashun teach de kolored pepil to lie and steel, and dey get putty good pupils mind I tell you. I will gis narronate what I oberheard atwene two colored men todder mornin in Broadway, to show you how near de darkeys hab got to liein. I wus saunterin along, tryin to make out what kind ob ?, sole ledder de beef-steak was made ob, 'dat I had fir break- fast, when I spied a dandy darkey all dressed up like a tailor-shop window. He had on dem new kind ob trowsers wid railroads a runnin all ober dem-and sich a no-tailed coat and ruffle shirt, wite kids and as hansome a pair ob moustachers as eber a buck goat cood boast ob. I wus a takin his mesure in my bed, and seein him strut, like a tur- key wid de rumatism, when I seed a common lookin darkey in a check shirt and trowsers, look at him, strike an attitude like de actor do when dere brudder cums home in de play, slap his hafns togedder, and sing out--"No, it ain't I kan it be puzable-yes, it am," and he rushes up to de dandy fel- ler, and grabbed his hand. "Why, Simon, am dis you-when did you 'ribe?" sed he, shakin de wite kid aU de time.   280        BLACK DIAMONDS. ' De dandy wus 'tonished and told him to be off, dat he dident noe a colored man ii de United States-and den he went on to say dat he wus frum England, and had cum ober wid his wite wife to see de Crystal Palace show, and had only bin here free days. "I nose you bin dare awaitin in a Lord's family," sed de kommon man, " but I node youwafore you went to London. You went as cook 'bord de 'Sally Ann'-my name am Sam Hossneck, yours wus Simon Clumson afore you went away - -what's your name now?" "Well, I see you noe me," returned de odder. "How you bin, Sam? Dey call me at home Lord Fondling, arter de family I lib Mid." "Well," sed de check shirt, " how does you like de koun- try, now you got back?" 1 Oh, I don't like it at all. Dere ain't nofin heah like we hab at home-nofia on so big, nor on so grand a scale." Hab you seen what four thunderin big round harts you kan git now for a cent-what a quart ob clam-soup fur six- pence, and what smackin big glasses ob I scream fur free cents, enywhere!bout de 'treets. Nofin on a grand scale, eh? Well, I like dat, putty much," interrupted Sam. "Yes, ebery ting heah am cheap and nasty-nofin as de- fined. You all need polish. You ain't got no parks, nor no statuary worf menshuning, and den your sogers, I seed dem 4th ob July, and seed dere little foo-foo cannons. Oh, Sam, ef you want to see sogerin, you muss cum to London. Dey ain't got a cannon as little as de 'Yankees, in de hole free kingdoms." "How big am London?" axed Sam. "'Bout four hundred times bigger dan New York. And Sam, dey got a kannon dere dat Daddy Lambert cood crawl in, and turn round and cum out agin."   "YING.          281 "Dat's a putty big gun," sed Sam, " but you ain't got no clams dar, nor no watermillions, no mushmillions, no oys- ters fit to feed pigs on, no lot-corn, nor none ob de odder luxuries, and besides, dere am a big gun at de Battery zow twice as big as yours."-Sam's patriotism wus risin. "How big isde kannon on de Battery?" axed de Dandy. "Well, it is so mity-big, dat it takes a yoke ob oxen to draw de ball in," sed Sam gis as ef he wus tellin de truff- but his friend seemed to dout it, and tinking to kotch Sam on de hip, asked him- "Ef i; takes a yoke ob oxen to draw de ball in, how does de oxen git out ob de gun agin, eh, Sam?" "Oh, you want to noe how dey git out?" axed Sam, a little puzzled. "Well, I'll tell you--ey go oult at de touch hole." "Well, Sam I gub in-cum and see me at No. -- Eliza- beth street," and so they seperated. Now which wus de biggest lier? I'll tell you-boff.

You pay me fur 'lighten your understandins, and holdin up de lite ob siance and human knowledge, and pintin out de paff and de way to happiness.

PROFESSOR HANNIBAL SPIRITED AWAY. His congregation in great trouble and confusion-a large re- ward offered for his recovery--supposed kidnapping case- READ!  READ 1 READ! 1 "AST night, as usual, we went to hear the scientific teaching of the learned and distinguished Professor Han- nibal, and give our readers a full and authentic report, as we have done for the last three years, of all that was said and done on each "'portant 'caiahun." When we arrived, the hall was full in every seat, and it was then time for the arrival of the Professor. There stood the glass of fresh water on the desk; the lamps and candles all burned with unusual brilliancy, but all was still as a country church- yard. Time flew on, but no Professor came. The hand- organ struck up a lively tune, accompanied by every foot in the crowd, and still no Hannibal came. Nine o'clock struck, and then the congregation became alarmed. Where can he be? ran from lip to lip, with the rapidity of lightning, and black looks were interchanged as one suspected the other of knowing all about the matter. Presently, "Brother Erastus Arlington James Madison Cowsnout," ascended the desk, and thus addressed the listeners- BRUDD*N AND SISTERS- It am a clar case, I is afraid, dat our belubed shep- herd hab strayed frum he flock. He am clard out, gone   288        BLACK DIAMONDS. 'way, absquatulated- mitzled, or bin stolen. Twenty minutes arter it was time fur him to be here at he post, I went, me rmyseff, to Anty Clawson's, whar you all know he bords, to see ef lhe wasent sick or sumfin, and dar I larned de sad tidius dat he dressed heseff up dis mornin, and went out, and hadent lfeen seen sence. He has, so Anty sez, bin laborin under an abreviashun ob mind lately, and only yis- terday he bought a shanghie rooster, as a pet, and wanted to get a monkey to see ef he coodent larn it sciance. Dere am no noein whar he am gone to, or wedder he went ob his own accord, or wedder he wus inticed away by some unxder- ground rale-rode feller, and karried off to sum odder kountry. Fellow citizens, Professor Hannibal am de lass man-dat we kan 'ford to lose frum de ranks ob siance, and I nose he lubed his flock too well to go off fram dem ob he own free will. ile cood a done dat long ago, fur I herd old Ben Longlip tell him my eff dat ef he'd cum to Long Iland, folks dar wood bild him a log hut all to heseff, and gib him more wages den he gits heah-and besides dat, he promised dat, he shood hab a boss and cart, so he cood peddle clams all de week, and make a little sumfin dat way, but he defused it all, and sed he wus done buildin castles in de air. Sumfin ort to be done to recober him, or git dameges fram sumbody. Here a fat darkey arose, and begged the priv'lege of speaking. It was granted. He mounted the desk and said- EtANABELONIANS-- I tink dis meetin ort to take sum axion on disgereave- ment, and offer a reward far his' discovery.

MY DEAH FRENS: I Is as happy as a jackass ober a tub ob oats to find you all heah again, and me in de middle ob de midst ob you all. I is sorry dat such circumstances- perwented me from lecturin lass week, and I is also likewise glad to find dat you tort so much ob your poor old shepard as to offer fibe dol- lars for his discovery when you tort I had met- wid some ob dem Spirit-mediums, and had been spirited away. I is mity sorry dat I fooled de congregation by not bein able to 'pear afore dem on dat August--no, it was not an August, it was a July accusion ; and I know dat a 'pology am 'spected frum me, derefore I will splain de reason dat I was absent, and to sum up de hole truff ob de matter, I -tell you plain as possible. I hab been Goughed in de most drefful manner. I'll tell you, all 'bout it, den you will be as wise as me on dat subjec.. On de mornin in quesshun, I dress myseff in all I had, determined to see de Cristile Palace, and so I set out for purpose. On my arribal at de door, de man dar, wid a star on de cote, was not a gwane to luff me in. I told him, it was necessary for de good ob de community dat I should see de show, to tell my congregation 'bout it-; den he ask me who I was, and when I told him my name, de door was at once opened, de sogerin police opened on both sides ob de gang   292        BLACK DIAMONDS. plank, an in I walked as proud as de hen at de head ob her brood ob one chicken. When I got in dar, I was aston- ished and putrefied at de sights I seed. On one side was a row ob Wenis ob Medicens, and on de odder, a row ob Apollo Belwedero in a state ob nakedness dat I tink shood be acted on by de Moral Deformed Society. Fig lebes must hab bin mity scarce in de country whar dese tings war made. It struck me as bein curious dat-no colored woman, man or child was in de exhibition, and I don't know de rea- son why, kase I'll turn dem out agin de. world on shape. It was quare to me, too, dat de sogerin police wood pass dese naked statues and wink at de immodesty ob de ting, and I'll bet de post office against de Astor house, dat if dese same sogerin police was to see me or you in de same state ob in- osence in de street, no matter how beautiful a nastytude we might assume, dey wood take us afore old Matsol, and we git tree monffs at hard labor. Dey got a good menny beastly statues dere-deres one whar a great big nasty snake hab tackted a lion wid his wife and children, and he's makin sassage meat ob dem at a wonderful rate. Dere am annudder ob a young woman dat was a gwane to market al- most naked on a boss, to sell eggs, when a big devourin lion, called a Amezon, jumped 'pon he hosse's neck and am in de act ob killin de hoss, while de young wowan am a kil- lin de lion wid a spear she shakes ober his head, derefore de statute desemble Shakspeare. I can't tell you much 'bout what I seed in dere to-nite, sacrifise it to say, dat arter seein all I cood, I leff, and was a comin home to come here and lecture, when I seed a sine dat a krockerdile was to be seen, and as I was still firstin for nolage, I went in to see it. Wile dar a wite man scra- ped my acquaintance, and was mity friendly. He sed he had heard ob me so offin, dat he wanted me to take a drink wid   ADVENTURE AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.    293 him, and when we left de krockerdile we journed to a soger water shop for dat purpose. I told him dat I didn't drink nuffin but soger water, and when it was poured out, he sed I had better take "a stick" in it for my stomjack sake, so I told him to put it in, and he did, and de fust ting I node I didn't noe nuffin, and de nex ting I node, I found myself home in bed at Anty Clawson's, wid de doctor on one side and a tin pan on de odder. I took an emetick and it woodn't stay on my stomjack, I was so bad. I am told dat I was found on a sellar door fass asleep, and was carried home widout my hat, which was stolen from my wenerable hed, on a wheelbarrer. Now I noe how prone womankind and mankind am to gossib and slanderize, and I speck de fust ting I heah will be dat I was drunk and dat I went on a spree, but de fust one in dis congregashun dat sez it, I'll find dem two dollars and take der cote till its paid, and den I'll read him or her out ob dis community. It am yet to be shone wedder od- der folks can't be Goughed as well as John B., derefore I warn you all not to luff your tongues run 'bout me. I'm determined to scrutinize my character at all hazzards, and I'll stick to myself like warm tar to, a darkey's head. I don't feel in good trim to-night ; my hed am as holler ob ideas as a dried bass drum, but nex week, if I hab helf you may look out for a lecture dat will be remembered.

"AMBIYOUS SATILITES- As I hab chowsin to become pussonal in my lecturs ob late to you, and as I see by de contents ob de sasser, do only rule I hab ob judgin in such matters, dat you like 'em radder muchly, I shall continue to 'lucidate 'pon folks in par- tickelyer, raddar den tings in general. De gemman whose karracter I shall lug up dis ebenin, wus once berry popelar, and rote a good menny plays and tings, and sed some ob de bess texts in de catalog. I 'tend to dewide wid you de nolege I hab ob DE POS'LE SHAKESPERE, a, gemman dat, gis as like as not, you hab herd spoken ob afore. Mr. Shakespere wus a hostler by trade, but gub it up in he youf to foller de actors. He was a fuss-rate school-boy, and always wore an imperial and tite buttoned jacket. His life wus one long contest fur bread and butter, gis de same as your humbly serbent's, me, myseff. He was born at ' Strat- ford 'pon an oven," so I heard a man once say, and dat 'counts for his habin sich a hard time ob it fru life. It am sed dat he wus born ob poor but honest parents, as if all poor parents wus not honest. Howeber, dats got noffin to do wid me. I sumtimes tink Massa Shakespere wus a cullerd man, kase in one ob he books he says to heseff, "Happy fur me T   ON SHARKSPEARE.       295 I am black"-and again he says sumfin looks as black to him as he own face. I don't sert it, howeber, as a, fack, to be laid doun fur futur proceeding. Shakespere went fru a great deal. He has been oftener murdered and susansided den enny odder man libin. He was fust killed in de battle ob Bozesfields, when he- wus a humped backed tirent, and offered a whole kingdom fur a hoss. Horses war scarce den and no mistake. De nex time he died, he run heseff fru de body wid he own sword in do tent, wid Mark Antony, or sum ob dem fellers. Den he cam to life agin and married a berry nice young woman, a darter ob an old codger in de toun ob Wenis, nie de moun- tain dat am all de time sick at its stomjack, and constant- ly throwin' up. Well, he got jellis ob he wife wid one Mike Cashio, a buck ob de times, and arter kickin up a fuss ginerly, and murder- in Mrs. Othello in her bed, he killed lieseff, gis as he took a sar- cumcised dog by de tale, and smoked him dus wid a cheese nife, but it didn't make a dif a bitterance to him how menny times he'm killed-not it. He was quainted wid a lot ob witches dat lib in de mountains ob Scotland, and I speck dey used to fotch him to life gis as ofin as dey pleesed. Well, ar- ter he kicked up sich a muss in Wenis, he went to Skotland, and turned soger man, and jined a Scotch company wid de bagpipes fur a band. Well, here he done up sebril fitins, and married a tarter by de name ob Mrs. Macheff, which made dem call him Macheff. She took it into her head to be a Queen, and made her husband kill off old Dunkin, who cum to Mrs. 'Macheffs login house. Here poor Shakespere was in anudder muss, and notwidstandin de witches sed he coodn't be killed agin by nobody born ob a woman, and as all men are born ob womins in general, Mr. Shakespere Mac- beff tort he'd hab a good time a libin out he days; but a   296        BLACK DIAMONDS. young feller named Mike Duff fixed his bizness for him, and he wus killed agin. Den he went in black fur heseff dat time, and went ober to anudder country, and passed himseff off on a young lady (named Ollfeelyer) as Gimblet, de Prince ob Dunkirk. Here de witches sent de ghost ob old Shakes- pere, de fadder ob de Pos'le Sam, who 'peared to him in de nite time in steel soger cloze, and when he seen he son, he trowed he beaver hat up fur joy. Dis suckumstance set de young man crazy, and he killed old Pompylonius, he fadder- in-law dat wus to be. Dis upset de hed-geer ob de young woman, and she went crazy too, and drowned herseff in de canal. Her big brudder, Mr. Leartus, or Lazarus (I can't remember names bery well wid dis cold I got in my hed,) and he had a regler fite, and stuck he gizzard wid a pison sword. Den he died agin-and one would suppose he'd seen 'nuff ob dis world ob bubbles. But no! de nex ting you find him as "King Lear," an old reprobate, full ob bligard talk and foolosofy. He, howeber, by dis time, hab got putty old and moss worn out. His children all cut frum him, septin bne, and she humbugd him too a little-but al- together, dey set him crazy agin, and he goes out in de woods in de equinoxtail storm, and dies agin. In readin his history, I was in hopes dat dis wus an end ob him, but it was not so. He agin revisits de arf wid a seemin detarminashun to see a little fun, as he had done bloody deeds 'nuff. So de witches fatten him up, and name him, dis time, Falstaff, and de fuss ting he did wus to go arter de wimin. He went doun to a little place called "Winsor,"and mixed in wid some odder men's wives, who dumped him into de riber out ob a doze basket. Dis gub him a cold in he institushun, and he cotched de edderwednes- day in histroat.

Ise not gwine to examine dere shells-wedder dey be hard or soft- I leaves dat to Anty Clawson, whose bizness it am to noe all 'bout shellfish, and derefore may be said to be fishally con- nected wid de subjic. What I want to interduce to 'lighten your dark under- standins, am de pollv-tishuns in de lump. I don't mean dat I want to interduce, dem to you pusonally; no 'mount ob bad pennies in de sasser would make me do dat. An' you may be glad 'nuff dat you're black in de face-for dat's all dat perwents you from fallin' inter de hans ob 'dese fellers. An' I want you to take kere an' not let me ketch you practisin' speeches by yoursefs, to 'stonish your mates an' make believe you'se bad as de wite man. It's only a wite man kin do politicks, an' I hopes dey will allers keep up de 'stinction 'tween dem an' de 'stinguished scions ob Africa. A polly-tishun has no opinions ob his own ; he am like a straw ; hold him up, an' he'll pint wich ebber way de wind ob poplar 'pinion blows him. Ef a platform breaks down, it don't hurt him, for he am like a cat dat allers lites on its feet; an' he runs rite up on anudder wun, an' hoorays as ef he allers belong dar.

Den he gits a bank note changed into sixpences, purpus to spend for treats wid ebbery body. He wares an ole hat, to look like a wurkin' man, an' he puts patches on his nees.  He makes his arms sore, shakin' hands wid ebbery body, an' 'tends to be 'tickler anxious 'bout de helf ob your wife and children. He is as sly as a possum; see him wid a 'ligious Man, an' he'll look an' talk like a minister in a camp meetin' ; meet him haf an 'our after talkin' to sum wild feller, an' you'll hear wurds dat, ef dey aint swearin', soun' wery much like cussin'. His nateral home am de top ob a stump, an' he keeps to it so long sumtimes, dat he looks as ef he growd dar--an no dout it wood be a good ting ef he did. But he hates to git off it, kase when he -cums doun, he's no bigger den odder pepil, an' not a bit better nedher. On it he gits as noisy as a wind-mill, and he's driv by de same power---wind. Wen he tauks an' rites he allers picks de longest words out ob de dickshunary, to kiver up his idees like wid a blanket; an' it 'peers as dough he was at panes to tuck de words in, under an' all 'round his thoughts, so dat no wun can see 'em, ef he's got enny, wich menny pepil dout-an' wid good reason. Or if ever he let's any idee 'pear, it's allers in sich a dress dat it may be 'splained to mean jist the contrary ting. 'Bout religion he never sez much, 'ceptin' dat men should , be liberal in dere 'pinions, which he is hessef, for he goes to ebbery church in his naborhood regular, and belebes in 'em all alike. Wen lecshun's ober, he grows smarter in his 'pearance, don't ware ole hats enny more, an' puts on hole trowserloons. He berry offen gits'uncommon short-sited after dis ewent, an' can't see de frens dat wus most useful in gittin' him office.

De almanack sez-and who nose more den de almanack? (sept an Alderman, maybe) dat in de time ob creashun, de woman was made lass. I kan see de wisdom ob natur in dis, kase ef she had bin made fuss, she'd a kicked up such a muss wid de rest ob de kritters, dat tings woodent a went as smooff as dey did. Arter all de odder beasts was done, and dere skins dried, den man wus made to rule ober dem, 'and den woman wus made to rule ober de man, and fram dat day to dis, she has 'done it to perfection, and fulfilled her mission to de letter. True, dey don't all take de same mefod to rule-sum ledes him wid a silken string, like the showman leads de bullefent wid a little cord, and odders dribe wid a rod ob iron. Natur when he made man, tort he had done sumfin grand, but when he formed all de little fancy bits ob clay, and turnd out a woman in all her lubliness, he seed plainly dat he'd toped de climax ob beauty.

It hab bin sed by able foolosefers, dat a bad woman am de worst ting on arf. I gess dem fellers neber got a rotten persimon in dar mouff wid no water handy. Sum married man say dat de woman am wuss den de debil when dey am a mind to be. Dey say dat she noes too much, dat she noes 'zackly whlen to make de bed wid thorns or fedders, when cold mutton and cold coughfee am to be sarbed up, and when no dinner at all, am best fur de comfort and happiness?ob de husband. One feller ses he can make his wife do gis as she's a mind to at enny time. Anudder ses, as long as he kan bring home lots ob cash, and gub his wife plenty ob spendin money, its all rite, but on de kontrary it am quite de reworse. Now I don't pertend to say nuffin 'bout dese tings on my own hook, derefore I isn't 'sponsible, but dey may rail aginst woman as much as dey like, dey kan't set me up aginst dem., I hab always fru life found dem to be de fust in lub, fust in a quarrel, fust in de dance, de fust in de ice-cream saloon, and de fust bess and lass in de sick room. What wood we poor debits do widout dem? Let us be born as young, as ugly and as helpless as we  plese, a woman's arms am open to recebe us. She it am who gubs us our fuss dose ob castor oil, and puts cloze 'pon our helplessly naked lims, and cubbers up our foots and toeses in long flannel petticoats, and it am she who, as we grow up, fills our dinner basket wid doenuts and apples as we start to skool, and licks us when we tare our trowsers. Itm she who in our manhood makes de moon brighter and bigger, and de stars to- twinkle in de ferminence wid de splendid glory (for take woman out ob de world, and night iwould lose de moss ob its beauty). It am she who robs   WOMAN.           808 trouble ob haff its sting, when de trouble ain't 'bout anudder woman.

Who kan help lubin women? I can't, and I don't car who nose it- wid all her faultshoods, I lub her, and I won't heah no'body spoke agin de sex no how. Ef I'd a bin Adam, and Ebe bad bin sent to me, dare needent a bin no snake tempted her, fur de debil wood hab bin in me as big as a cowcumber, and I'd a tempted her mysef, and ef enny ob you will go So de Crystal Palace and see Mudder Ebe a standing dere, as Mr. Powers ses she was, I don't tink you kan blame me fur ownin up.

LECTURE   XCII. ABOUT THE OLD ENEMY. BLUBD BRUDDREN AND SISTERN: WHAT ile' am to de steam bulgine, sciance am to de human intelleck. It keeps it from rustin. Ef it wasn't fur ile de machinery wood become damp and rusty, and ef it wasent fur sciance, de mechenery ob de tinkin apperatus ob man wood be in de same sitewashun, kase water kannot produce wus kloddings to de axel-trees ob de steamboat, den ignumrence can do to de axel-trees ob de brane. Dere- fore, I dewise you all to keep your brane pan as dry ob ig- numrence as possible, and make free use ob de ile ob sciance. You can apply it wid de fedder ob useful nolege, and den see how easy it will be to confound de moss brilliant ideas ob de men dat hab passed before you, and dose dat hab passed behind you. Habin settled dis pint, as de hungry boarder sed on swallerin de coughfie, I will draw your 'tenshun (and I suppose dats 'bout all I will draw frum you to-nite), to de great subjick fur 'siderashun dis ebenin. Sum ob you dat am easily scart, may- be frightened when dey cum to see de animal dat I purpose to introcumduce to you. But I don't car. It am necessary dat you shood be 'lighted on all subjicks. I had tackled all kinds ob animals fur your intertainment and nolege, and now you will see what an awful feller I tackled for your sakes dis time. De feller I introcumduce to you on dis 'portant caishun, am an old friend ob yours. De reson I tink you all know him, am bekase I hab herd almost ebery one ob you men-   ABOUT THE OLD ENEMY.       305 shun his name in connecktiou wid almost eberything you talk 'bout. I may as well tell you, widout keepin you in suspen- ders enny longer, dat I 'tend to lecture dis ebenin on de chap none to eberybody, as DE DEBIL, Don't be scart, my frens, I am not gwane to bring him here in his "proper personage," as we say in Latin. He won't be, here no more to-nite, den he always has bin. I hab offen herd folks say dey ment to raise de debil, but dere am no record ob de fack being done, 'cept de record found in de komic almanick, whar dat good old man, Loronzo Dow, raised him in de Western country out ob a barrel ob cotton. Wedder dat story am true or not, rests, wid the konshence ob de almanick. De debil am an old customer, I tell you. We fust heah 'ob him in de shape ob a snake in de garden ob Eden (whar, as I told you a week or two ago, he played de debil wid mudder Ebe), and frum dat time to de present, he hab taken up he abode all ober creashun. Sumtimes he am found in de hart ob de miser-sumtimes on de lips ob de clergy, and he makes a perfect randavious ob de loafers mouth, fur he am always in it. He am none by seberel odder names besides his right one. I don't noe ob any one in de whole range ob my 'quaintan- ces, who hab so menny recognized " knick " names as he. He am called Old Knick, Satan, Belzebub, Old Harry, Old Scratch, Jimmy Squarfoot, Old Horns and Tail, Old Fellow, Old Brimstone, and fifty oder names too well known to men- shun. Dere am no use for me to 'tempt to describe dis feller to you, kase dere am nobody dat nose nofin 'bout him, and all my resarches outside ob de pictur book hab bin in wain.   306        BLACK DIAMONDS. De pictur books ]paints him wid horns, foots, and tail, like an ox-wid a face like an owl, and a body like a man. But folks, generly, don't seem to 'bleve dat am his dogertype likeness, or else dere words belie d(m most consumtively. t De fack am, no two pepil dat I hab met durintg my studies on the subjick, seem to tink he am alike. For instinc, how often you hear sich remarks as dese on de Rialto. One man will say to annuder, "Good mornin, it am devlish cold to- day." Yes, ses de .odder feller, but it wus as hot as de debil yesterday, and Upon my word, sich warm wedder ab brought de flesh off ob me, 'till I am devlish thin." "Well,":sez de fust spokesman, " hot wedder acks different wid me. i- always get deblish stout in de, summer time." Dere, you see one nman hab de idea ob de debil bein cold and stout, :hile de odder tink he am hot and slim. See de infrenceI 1 Den again you will heah men say dat sumbody wus as mad as de debil 'bout sumfin--and de nex minit you will heah de remark dat sumbody wus devlish civil. So I might go on and state dese contradictory notions all nite, widout making de fac more crystalised. De wite trash paint de debil black, but in de Africa dey paint him wite -dere you see de infrences again-an' which am right. Eben Foolosefer Greely kan't deside wid cnny satisfackshun to de kommunity--but ob corse he'd go his deff on black. Nobody eber seen dis debil, aldo he hab bin on arf from the fust morning de world was made, and dere nebber hab bin enny 'counts ob he'deff, eder by telegraph or newspapers, up to seven o'clock tonite, kase I've bin- watchin fur de news all de week sence I 'eluded to lecture 'pon his lowness. Ef dere am one fellow hated more den unudder, it am de scoundrel mentioned in de tex. He am nebber menshuned in what am termd good society, but he am as big as a   ABOUTr TH- OLD ENEMY.     307 wood-chuck in dlere midst all de time. Sum folks go so far as to 'spress dere dislike to him in poetry, by requesting eberyvbody "To whip de debil round de stump, Ebery crack will make him jump." I hab no doubt, judgin frum his moral character, dat he richly deserbes tarin and feddrin, besides bein licked, like- like-de debil. He must be a dredful- bad feller, and his influence muss be severely felt in dis country, when it costs ober a hundred millions a yeer to support churches and preecher mans to fight wid him, and keep down his power. Dere am no noein whar he cum frum zackly. One poor old blind gemmon, by de-name ob Milton, wrote a beauful piece ob poetry, describing his dounfall, but all his theory am nocked flatter den Tom Hyer nocked Sullivan; when we refleck dat he wus wid Adam and Ebe, in de garden ob Paradise; sence which time sum say he hab taken up he abode in Wall street. In 'clushun, 6thly, I will cut de subjick short. I don't meen curtailin de beast, but de lectur 'pon him. De fack is, I don't like to be too familliar wid him on no account-fur I, wid de. rest ob mankind, hab ebery reson to be afeered ob him, fur ef he once claps his harpoon in you, you am a goner. Sum say dere am no debil--dat's a lie, my frens, fur ef he wus out ob de way, dere wood be no murder, no more law- suits, no more rum drinked, and consequently no more prisons. Dere am a debil, and he is alibe, and he am arter ebery one ob you, and he will take eben bets dat he will hab you. He am always playin round your konshences, and ef you don't look out, he will slip into your heart, and make it a hard shell afore you know it. He am capable ob coming to you in enny shape, or in enny form he choose, and dats de   ' 308        BLACK DIAMONDS. reson one pusson tinks him so different frum de odder. Dats de reson he am hot to one, and cold to de odder. Oh, you poor deluded sinners, I dewise you to be on de alert, as de 'lecshun bills say, and keep your eye skinned fur future futurity. Try to go tru de world like a man-be kind and charitable to all-stick to your friends-be honest, and always speak de truf, and de debbil will not bodder you much-he don't like sich company-and he generly gubs sich lolks a wide birf. You will, ob corse, find it hard to ward off his berry 'fectionate influence, but stick to de de- termination to kick him off, and you will finally reach de odder side ob Jordan, de only place where he am none not to exist. Wid dese reflecshuns, I drop de subject like de monkey dropped de hot potato. I cood paint out de horrible hole where he libs, tell you de natural smell ob de place, de color ob de flames, and de state ob de fremometer, but I won't.

De tex 'luded to, am often seen at de markets also, and am one ob de moss famil- iar subjicks dat I cood fotch up frum de deep waters ob ob- livion, to spread afore your darkened intellecks. De feller I shall dissect to-nite, ani called in de English tongue, DE LOBSTER. I 'spose you wood all radder hab him den heer tell ob him, but dats gis like de darkey, and a good menny wite folks, too. Dey kan't beer ob nofin good widout wantin it. Dere am more selfishness in de world den menny pepil am apt to suppose. De lobster, my frens, am one ob de moss curious interestin fellers dat runs in de mud. He ain't half so beautiful as de rinosinhos, nor as lively as a flea. I tink, howeber, he am ob de flea species, or de flea am ob de lobster spe- cies, gis which you like. Dey am boff some on a nip, gis   310        BLACK DIAMONDS. like de sportin man. He libs in a shell, like de clam, but am- no more relashun to de clam family, den I am to Samuel Shakspere. When de world wus made, dere wus a good menny tings created dat wood tax de wisdom ob de author ob de bess foolosofers dat ebber libed. Adam was consulted by letter about it, but found no use to put him to, and he sent word dat all critters dat coodent be used muss be devoured, and mankind hab bin hard at de lobster eber sence-but de more dey eat de more seems to turn up. It hab always bin a mystery to me, and I may say to odder lightened foolosofers ob de day, to. make out what de lobster wus fust intended fur, afore it wus decreed dat he wus to be eat up. It mite hab bin a wrong decree, but de poor ting had no way ob defendin its cause. He coode nt call a conwention to proteck his rites, like de wommin ob de present day. He coodent mount de rostrum and speechify -folks wood only laff at him-derefore his desendents do all dey kan to show dar disgust fur de imposition flicted 'pon dem, fur dey am never put into de pot dat dey don't blush all ober wid de heat ob resentment. When human nature made him in de fust place, I belebe dat it wus a speriment gis to see how ugly a ting cood be cre- ated, and how odd a customer cood be made to lib. I haD often tort dat it wus fust intended to make him a cupple ob legs, and place dem in de middle ob de body, so he cood walk upright, like de dandies and de owl, but dis speriment was 'bandoned when it wus taken into 'siderashun dat no- body cood make glubs to fit his claws, kase you see ef he had bin made wid legs, his claws wood ob corse be his hands.  Ef he had bin made to walk uprite, he wood hab, made a good companion, or perhaps a kind ob waiter to de old deb- bil heseff, and a pretty pair dey wood hab made fur a small   THE LOBSTER.         3" party.

His creashun wus a grand speriment in menny ways, fur he am de only animile dat libs, dat combine de two sex, hemale and she- male, in one, and Nateral History sez dat "dis fac alone makes dem de moss wonderful ob all creashun, and wordy ob de study ob de scientific, and ob corse dat means me." I cood go on splainin singelar tings 'bout dis double-jinted feller all nite, but it wood be no use ; all you care about him, am to stuff your bred baskets wid him, and while you are tarin his insides out, you ro more car how dey got dar, den I car who's de nex Presemdent. You got no more soul fur siance, den a goose has fur music. Dere am one or two tings connected wid him besides his tale, dat may how- eber strike you on de nolege box, as bein bery queer. One ob dese am de fac dat it am as much trouble fur him to git a new cote upon his back, as it is fur one ob us fellers, and he is compelled by de force ob sarcumstances and de grofth ob his body, to change his jacket ebery year, gis like de skool boy. - De great difference, howeber, am dat gettin a new jacket always makes de lobster sick abed fur a few days, so he hab to be doctored, and de same operashun in de corse ob de skool-boy's life, make a holiday fur him. / D} lobster is a kute feller. He ginerly hides heseff awa doun on de bottom ob de sea, behind a rock, or in a bunolb coral, or sea-weed, and dere he sticks fur hours on de layI wictims, gis like de gamblers ob de city. When a little fislomes along fishin fur bugs, he will find, to his utter 'stonish ent, a big claw cum doun on him like a slege hammer, and a e he recubbers frum he fright, he am in de jaws ob deff and oBlobster.   312         BLACK DIAMOND S. You see he steals fur a libbin, and fights like a mad wo- man when he gets kotched at it. Take him alltogedder, claws and all, and you will find him a hard case-let him git a chance, and de impressiona he will make upon you, will sassagefy you ob dat fac. You mite better play wid a steel trap den 'tempt to make a pet ob one ob dem, ef he's no bigger den a piece ob red putty. iDere; you noe all about de lobster now, and speck you feel greatfool fur it.

THE MONKEY. CURRIOUS CUSTOMERS- IT am berry currigen to your humble speeker to see  sich a crowd ob pussons assemble har each lectur nite. De reesoiob sich crowded houses am owin to it bein free. You will allers find free consarts an free lecturs crowded, no matter how poor de iutertainment am dat's offerred. Dat I call a noble zample ob "our free ins titutions," as de politishions say. I hab bin inquested to lectur on a cur- rious an by no meens sublime subjick dis ebenin, an darfore I will pleese de brudder by scribein de culiarities ob a feller you all despise, but nebberdeless he muss be induced to your dark intellects. You will find de subjick fured to in all de jimalongical sub- stitutes or carawans in de country, an in all de museums, edder stuffed in a glass case or runnin round de floor wid a string tied to he middle. I speck you begin to smell sumfin like a rat as to who de feller am ; but ef not, I'll tell you plump an squar, widout wishin to insult you, dat I wish to call your 'tention to- DE MONKEY. De monkey am s'posed, by sum ob de nigerent peepils, to be de connectin link atweene de ingin rubber mare maid dat belongs to Mr. Barnum, and de culler'd man. Odders tink dat dey am cross grained atweene de possum and de kange- "   314        BLACIT DIA ONIr;.S. roo ; but my deluded frens, sich am not de fack. Dey am -a stinck race by demseffs, an dey noe too much for de wite man, and de culler'd man too. Dey noe nuff to keep dar jaws closed, so dey won't hab to work an take care ob demseffs like us fellers, an de way some ob dem does fool de wite trash am a caushun to lawyers. Dar am sebril kinds ob monkeys, called by different names, de same as de different tribes ob ingins, an range from de big rang-a-tang, five foot high, to de little whinein monkey no bigger den a kitten, wid a tail as long as de Pilgrim's Pro- gress. Dey am cubber'd wid hair, like a hair trunk, an dey 'luff dar wiskers grow in de French fashion. You mss not tink dat dem dandies you meet in Broadway wid dar face cubber'd up with hair till dey look like a rat a peakin true a bail of oakem, am rang-a-tangs, kase dey aint; for de pure breed hab got a narrative attached to dem dat dese dandies wouldn't fatig demseffs to carry round, less it war fashuna- i  ble ; but I tink dey am raudder shamed ob demseffs, for look- ing so much like a big monkey, an for fear dat sensable peepil will take dem for de pure speches, dey had dar coats cut off as short as posable, jis to luff all de world see dat dey hab not got a tail. Ef de tailors war to cut dar coats longer, mennyvdat now pass for human beins would be in fear to lemenade de treet, leest de show shop man kotch an kage dem. But dey needn't bin a fraid, kase dey wood be foun ob a tirely different speeshes from de monkey as soon as dar high coat collar were turned down fishently to show dar ears. Now you noe de reeson dat de dandies wares de high collar and de short tail coat. De monkey am de moss decetful of all human nature. When you got your eye on him, you'd tink butter wouldn't melt in he mouf; but de minnet your back am turned, he   THE MONKEY.         3 1  am cuttin up de old debil hesseff.

When dey am dressed up In man's or wimmen's close, dey look so much like de culler'd poperlashun dat it makes a darkey mad to look at him. But den dey needn't feel dat way, kase dar muss be a line drawn, an a conneckshun link sumwhar. De monkey infek de souffern reegons ob de atmosfere, todder side ob de equinoxtail line, an am found in large corm- I munities round Cape Cod, an dar dey lib wid as much inde- pendence as de Mormons, an like dem hab as menny wibes as dey like. Dey hab a king mong dem, who hab as much rite to rule his tribe as de ill-begotten neffew ob his unkle hab to rule obber France. History sez dat wen de monkeys git too menny for de wite peepil dat li;b whar dey am, an wen it becums danger- ous for a spectable female to lebe her home for feer ob bein nocked doun by dem, den the wite folks go hunt dem, but dey am too full ob de injin rubber an telemgraffick fluid to be kotched. Den de wites resort to cullerd man's cunningness to stroy dem. Dey git a dozen baskets an fill dem wid rice an 'lassuq, an set em doun 'bout a hundred yards apart long de road, an dey lay tree or four clubs long side ob de baskits. Den de wite folks hide demseffs away. Putty soon de monkeys smell de rice, an cum out ob de woods arter it, but none ob dem dar, go hie to it, an dar they stand for a hour chatterin jis like Kongress men obber de spiles ob office. Well, bime by de lady monkeys bein more feerless den de ress, go up to de baskets to eat de rice, an to scure it to demseffs dey grab a club. Den de ole he fellers rush upon dem like a hawk on a chicken, to take it from dem, an dey grab anudder club, an den a fite begins, an ginerly one haff am killed or babby wounded, so dat dey can be kotched an tried.

POMP EdYS WEDDING. (A Fact.) DELITED LAMS- HERE I is agin, feelin as fresh as a noreaster, but I hope to be less cuttin. My 'fections am as strong as a lo- comotive fur you, and as warm as free o'clock in dog days; and notwithstandin I buse you sumtimes fur to make you better, my hart clings to you like molasses to a ruff stick. I say dis on dis caishun, not so much to raise a big colleck- shun, as to luff off de honest feelin dat lays hid under de leff side ob dis worn out west-cote. Since de lass time I had de pleasure ob distressin you frum dis old nostrum or desk, I hab seen a little fun. I've bin to a weddin way out in dat kountry ob clam-shells and ledder chips-Jersey. I wont tell you whose bin a gittin married, till I tell you how I was fooled out ob de job. De odder Saturday nite, Anty Clawson and me-me and   POMPEY'S WEDDING.       317 Anty hab made all up agin, and I am aguane back dar to lib; we cum to a neutral understandin 'bout tings; I am to hab pan-kakes de same day dey am cooked; de clam flitters am to hab clams in dem; de coughfee am to be trong nuff to run on all caishuns, and clear itself out; dere- fore I tink I will hab less grounds to find fault wid; and anudder ting am, de gutta percha steaks and doe-nuts am to be pounded afore dey cum on de table, to sabe jaw- bone exercise. Well, as I was sayin, me and Anty Clawson wus agwane fru Senter Market at a late hour, in order to git tings cheap, when who shood I spi wid a tin kettle but Brudder Pompy and Brudder Reigh, a standin at a clam stand a gittin dere kittles full. I tort frum de looks ob Pompy dat sumfin 'straordinary wus gwane on, kase he looked full nuff ob happyness to bust. Ebery now and den he'd swaller a raw clam hole. Tinks I to myseff, inside my hed, Pompy muss be in lub, and am habbin a little Fourth ob July to heseff, so I called hle frend aside, and I axed him what's de matter wid Pompy. "Don't you noe?" sed he. "No," sed I. "Well, den," sed he, "Pompy am gwane to git married to Sister Martha Maria, on Monday morning, at Coggys- vill, ne to Patterson, and he am now gittin a few clams fur de weddin brakefast. I wus damfounded, to tink how de outdatious Pompy dare do sich a ting, and not let me noe it; not ebin gib he old shepherd de job ; but I dident say nufin to nobody, and no- body did so to me, but when Monday cum, I gis took de de- pot and went to Coggysvill, gis to see ef it wus true. When I ribed, de ceremony wus ober, but matrimony wus dar in all its glory. Julius was dar, too, and he made no   318       BLACK DIAMONDS. "bones" in inducin me to de family. De bride looked splen- diferous ; her eyes shine like stars in de furninence afore daylite in de mornin, and she blushed like a biled lobster when I shook her lubly hand. Pompy wus all out on de caishun; blue buttoned brass cote, wid high-heeled shirt- collar, pink vest, red-crawat, and odder fixins. - He wus as full ob animation as a skruce beer bottle, and seemed as redy to go off. I wus doun on him fur not luffin me noe about it, but he polegized and sed it wus de-bride's wish, so ob course I wus like de feller dat wus cotched in de act, I hadn't a word to say fur myself. I wus vited to stay to dinner, and I tell you what, we had a first-rate programe: clam soup, fried clams, clam pie, and odder tings in season, in de greatest confusion. But de fun dident kommence till arter dinner. As soon as de table wus dared off, de flo wus dared fur a dance. Brudder Reigh took doun dat good old fiddle, Brudder Pompey siezed his tamborine, and Brudder Julius took up his bones, and den de music begin to ring out on de air, and sich music-it was sweet nuff to make de angels stop on dere errants ob mercy and listen to it frum de clouds. We all danced to our harts' contents. Fust we, had de Scotch- ich, den we had de elbow-lord-o, den de resowair, den cum de pole-cat,.den de cowtilion, and den de jigs on all fours. We danced till you'd a tort hebin and arf was a cummin toged- der. We swassaged up and doun, lemonaded all round, and when dat was ober, clam-soup was serbed, wid crackers and skruce beer. At sum weddins dey gub you Hidesick wine, but we had stomacksick skruce beer which am jist as good in fly time.

Dey boff survived, but de shock wus radder too much fur a maiden lady in lielock pink silk, who pertended to faint in a young Irishman's arms. I ribed home safe wid de rest, kase dat dident happen to be de day fur de rail-rode axidents. Pompy hab gone-to Bohucken on a weddin tour, and he writes me by de furrin male dat he's as happy as a hog in an apple bin at a sider mill, and I sincerely wish you war all as happy as Pompy and he young bride. Ef you should meet Martha Maria at enny time, don't look squint-eyed and noein at hei, kase none ob you don't noe what you may cum to yet; and above all, keep dark.

A HARD SUBJECT. INLITEND SINNERS--- DE subjick dat I chose fur lucidashun dis time, am one ob de herdest, when it am cooked in a proper way, ob enny I hab as yet tempted to exasperate to you. It am so common to you all, dat I noe you look 'pon it as beneaf your notice, but nebber de less, it will serbe as an instrument to beat nolege into your tick heds. I derefore will call your 'tenshun to de BRICKBAT, which I lay 'pon de desk. Now you will all be mity aston- ished when I tell you dat dis brick, ruff and onsmoff as it am, am gis as good as you am, and in some instances, a good deal better, fur it kan't commit enny sin nor nuisances. It am made ob de same matereal as you is, and de only difference dat I can see, am de fack dat de brick hab bin put fru de fiery furnace afore it am a brick, and you fellers hab 'yet got to go fru de brimstone. De Samest sez dat human natur "Made us ob clay and formed us man," don't it? Well, what difference to dat am a brick made? Don't de man in brick-kill make it ob clay, and form it brick? Well den, whats de inference? Why, dat de man am as good as de brick, and dat some men am bricks, and nothin shorter. Bricks and mankind am closer connected den mose * '   A HARD SUBJECT.        321 people wood at first consebe. De brick hab stood his frend aginst wind and wedder fur centeries, and notwidstandin it am gittin de cold sholder ob de berry class it hab proteckted fur ages, sence de rage fur wite marble hab set in, and de brown granite hab become fashunable, still it finds a lbery prominent-place in all sibilized kountries. De brickbat follows sibilizashun as fast as a hungry dog wood a piece ob raw meat tied to a bull's tail-in fact, sibili- zashun seems to karry it wid her whareber she goes; fur as soon as she steps her foot in a kountry, bricks seem to start out ob de ground. You may no more speck to find de brick 'mong sabage nashuns, den you mout speck to see de works ob Samuel Shakespere 'preciated in a hog pen. Derefore I say unto you, suspect de brickbat as a friend ob dose two sweet sisters, Peace and Sibilizashun. I noe you am reddy to say dey ain't always found 'mong de peaceful and sibilized, kase dey am found in all kinds ob rows at 'lecshun fites. But my frens, ef dey am found flyin 'bout like fedders in a gale ob wind in de Six Ward sumtimes, am dat de fault ob de bricks? Ob corse not ; it am de fault ob de men, as Judge Bigrbean said when he heard de lass case ob seducklshun, and his 'pinion wood hab bin considered gis as good as law, ef de Jury hadent a spilt it by layin de whole blame-'pon de plain- tif, which, in dis partickler case, wus a woman in loose slebes and looser morals. We am all too apt to look doun 'pon folks dat cum frum- gis as good stuff as we did. Whars de difference, I ax you agin, atwene de man and de brick? When man was formed d out ob de clay, a nose and a mouf wus put 'pon him, and de bref ob life wus blown in it, and he jumped up reddy to start a newspaper. Spose de same ting had bin done to de brick, woodent he bin gis as good as we? Ob corse he wood. Don't we, when boff ob us hab becum useless to de world, "*   32 2        BLACK DIAMONDS. return to brick dust? Ob corse we do. Well, den, who 'mong de greatest foolosefers dat eber cramed his bed wid nolege, kan see de difference? Not one, my frens, derefore dat pint am settled. De brick am a useful ting, and seems to be thort ob more den menny tings possessin' more beauty and rale worth. Sum men am so covetious ob dem, dat dey take home a hat full almoss ebery night. Dere am a man dat libs 'pon de fust floor 'bove me, dat muss hab a room full by dis time, fur he hab bin berry industrious a bringin dem home. Sumtimes he has a bigger lode on den odders, and den his hat am so heaby, it makes- him stagger like a punkin on de end ob a rattan stick. I don't noe what he dus wid dem, as I neber see him bring enny ob dem out. Once a cart backed up in front ob de house, and I specked to see a hole lode go 'way, but not a brick cum out-all de cart took, wus ashes frum de barrel on do walk. When old Hipopotomus, de Greek foolosefer, came frum Ireland, and seen a brick fur the fust time, he spent six weeks and a fortnight a tryin to find which way de grain run; but as he coodent find out, it went aginst his grain to work enny longer, and so he bandoned de job, hopin dat C. Ed- wards Lester might detect it, wid de rest ob his mares nest, and publish de result ob his resarches wid his attack 'pon Presemdent Pierce in de Lundon Times ; but as yet he ain't told de London people nofin 'bout it. I wood tell you how de brick am made ef I cood. I went to a brick-yard wid dat 'tenshun, but as I found I wood hab to bring de hole yard, kill and all, wid me to do so, I 'cluded dat it wood be easier fur you to go to de yard dan fur me to bring it along. I axed de man which he tort wus de moss perfect bricks, and he sed 49's fellers. Wid dis   THE FLEA.         323 startling information ringin in your long ears, I will cave in fur de ebenin, as soon as Sister Angelina Sofaria Abgil Jinkins passes 'round de sasser-and while she am doin de same, I will state dat I nebber wus haffin need ob frens and dimes as I am on dis 'portant caishun. LECTURE XCVII. THE FLEA. FOUL AND FAIR SEX-- I RISE to nite full ob fried clams and spurior nolege fur your edicashun. De clams I got at Anty Clawson's, and de nologe I got frum books and 'sperience, during my sojourn, or sogerin (gis as you mind to call it), in dis wicked world, and whale ob tears. Fried clams am berry good in dere place, and, dere place am in de stumjack ob de human body. But oh, my poor ignumrunt frens, nolege am bette. Clams puff you up, and make you feel mity big in your pusson-but nolege goes to de hed, and de more you hab ob it, de lighter it seemy--de more you .noe, de less you tink you noe." Clams vanish in a day, but nolege sticks in your head like a chesnut bur to a cow's tail. Derefore you see de tilulity ob fillin de bed as well. as de stomjack. My useal unquenchable thirst fur nolege hab led me to contemplate sum tings fur splainificashun dis ebenin, dat may strike 'pon your emty nolege boxes as bein queer. I shth introcumduce to your notice on dis 'portant cai- shun, one ob de liveliest and most industrious fellers in dis   324        BIACK DIAMONDS. kommunity, and one which I noe you hab spent hours in constant sarch arter, so curious was you to find 'em. I shall derefore, widout leaf or licence, tell you all I noe 'bout DE FLEA. De flea, my frens, am one ob de most curious suckers in de world, as his history will fully probe. He belongs to de species ob de politishun, de elemfent, de grasshopper, de porkepine, and de soger man. Dere am nobody nose 'zactly whar he cum frum, nor whar he am a gwane to-but ebery body nose when he am present, and dats all dey noe 'bout him. When Mr. Noah bilt he Ark, and took in a hemale and shemale ob ebery kind ob beast and fowls, he muss hab for- got to take de flea abord, or else de picture books lies like a Jew-pedler, kase I've bin a sarchin dem all ober fur to find him 'mong de fodder animals agoin in de Ark, and he ain't dar. Derefore it am naturally infused dat Massa Noah eder dident want to be trubbled wid de costomer, or else he coodent kotch him to take aboard. I guess finally he was- ent dar at all, kase in all dA 'counts I hab read 'bout dat xpedishun ob Massa Noah wid de Ark, I neber see his name menshuned. -Den de natural inquiry am-whar did he cum frum? I will tell you. He cum out ob de saw-dust, fur it am a well none fac, which almoss ebery carpenter and odder foolosferm will tell you, ef dey nose it, dat hemlock saw-dust will breed fleas. Ef you fill a little bag wid saw-dust and luff it lay whar de sun and rain will hab full power 'pon it, you will see de liveliest bag in 'bout free weeks, dat you eber seed, and as far at a distance as you kan keep frum it, de better it will be fur your peace and quietness. I say dese tings unto you, me myseff. I said de flea be-   THE FLEA.          325 longed to de specie Politishun. Wharefore? you will ax; I will splain. De politishun and de flea am alike, kase you don't noe whar to find eder ob dem. Dey hop, skip, and jump 'bout so, dat dere am no putting your finger on eder ob dem. De politishun hab bin none to jump frum  one platform to anudder, and show as astonishin agility as de flea dare do. See de infrence l He am like de elemfant, kase he karries a trunk, and dis trunk ob his, am what he uses as a suckshun hose to suck de blood ob us poor mortals-he runs it in de pours ob de skin, gis like de fireman puts his suckshun hoses into de water, and den he goes to work, and ginerly lebes wid his trunk full ob de licker ob life. He am fifty times stronger den de elem- fint, kase he kan jump more den a hundred times he lenf, and dats what de elemfant kan't do no how he can fix it. Woodent Mister Elemfent look nice a tryin to jump ober Trinity Church? What a row it wood kick up in Broad- way I Woodent folks stare? De jumpin qualities ob de flea brings him in de family ob de grasshopper as near as fifty-first cousin. What makes him a relashun to de porkempine, am de fac dat I discub- bered fru de Tell-lie-scope, and- dat am, dat his body am cubbered all ober wid little squills at de jints which stick up sharp like pints ob needles--and de reason why he am like a soger man, am bekase his hole body am cubbered ober wid a coat ob mail, made in jints, gis like de old soger coats ob male wus made afore de dragoon killed Saint George, ober dar in Ireland. De flea am a happy feller, and seems to enjoy his Jimnas- tick exercises as much as de fellers in silk tights and shirts, who make a libin by tumblin in de circus on a piece ob second-hand carpet. In moral principal de flea am a scoundrel in ebery sense   326        BLACK DIAMONDS. ob de word. He has no conipunkshun in attackin his enemy when he am asleep, and two fleas will keep a feller on a spring bed all nite, and worry him almoss to deff. He is a backbiter ob de worst character, and deserbes all de smash- ins he gits frum eberybody. Dere am little none regardin his moral character, as nobody kan keep his company long enuff to find it out. It am not none wedder he belebes in de mariage tie. He may be in fabor ob temperance, but I'll be sworn on de almanack dat he will take a nip when- eber he kan git de chance. Dus endef de chapter. Dere will be a meetin ob de society fur loungin 'round de Park Fountain and de coal boxes on de corners, in dis room on Saturday nite nex, to take into 'siderashun de necessity ob providen winter quarters. De komitee appinted to foller de sogers, nie de band, will report on dat caishun. Dere duties hab bin berry great fur de lass few days, as de soger companies am berry prebelent gis now, and dey stand in need ob new boots. De kommittee pinted by dis kongregasun to see what kind ob lbacco I chaw, and what kind ob coffee I drink, will report tsg soon as dey confer wid de Bishop Doane Commit- tee. Luffem cum to question me on dem'pints, dats all. Will Brudder Jemes Jargon Bennet please pass round de sasser dis time. He hab bin away so long dat all he frens will like a peep at him.

FELLOW CITIZANS- As de 'lecshum am all ober, and tings hab taken a dif- ferent turn to what dey used to wus, I tink it am time I had a few words to spoke to de wite folks bout demseffs-tings am gittin to sich a pitch-derefore I will call dis lectur de SECOND PISTOL TO. DE NEW YORKERS. I shall on dis 'tickler 'caishun diwide my subject into seb- ril pieces, like de Yankees dos de turkey at home at Tanks- gibbin time, and like Rusha wants to do abroad. Fustly-Arter lookin abroad on de universitv ob natur and see how tings grow up in dis world, it makes me laff to orntemplate de prisumpshun ob you New Yorkers.

I suffered dat up all by my- self, on de led ob a barl wid a piece ob stick lass Sunday mornin on de warf. Now ef you call dat wisdom, I'd like to know what price de teachers in de free skules git a monf for dissemblin edicashun and nolege fru de pepil. Common sense mout hab teached de sober second thoughts ob de wite folks dat sixty lofers wus more xspensif to keep 'pon public pap den forty wood be, kase dey am all such big eaters. Sixly-Whar am all de money cumin frum, to keep all dese fellers? Whar will dey all bord? De tea room am busted; de Sitty Hall aint big 'nuff to 'commodate dem, and derefore dey'll have to sleep in de Stashun House. Now don't you all tink, on taken a retrograde aspeck of tings, dat you deserbe a big club wid a bladder on de end ob it, ober your heds? Ninely-I do, ef you don't. Fifely-You New Yorkers don't noe more den you ort to, no how, and de wust ob it am, you won't lern. When Mr. Kowshoot, or Cowsnout, or whateber his name wus, de Hun- gry un, cum here like Yankee Doodle, wid a fedder in his hat, a ridin on a pony, you formed yourseffs into a kurmittee ob de hole, and you tort you'd make pollytical capitol out ob him. You flocked to see him, and ass:corted him tru de streets all in your soger close, eber so nice.

His name am Kostza, or Cctchta, and ai anudder Hungry-un, who am willin to live and die one. You ain't satisfied ob makin asses ob yourseffs once, but want to do de same likewise agin also. You want to get up a public reception to show off your so- ger cloze, and set de tax payers a swearin.

JULIUS CAESAR HANNIBAL GOING ON A TOUR TO EUROPE. GREAT MEETING. THE "Hall ob Siance," in which the learned and distin- guished Prof. Hannibal has held forth for the last four years was densely crowded last night by a large and enthu- siastic meeting of his congregationf As soon as all the candles were topped, an aged "brudder" arose in the desk, and in a tremulous tone, read aloud the follpwing letter from the sage and philosopher: Anty Clawson's Seller, Noon-time, April, 1854. BELUDED LAMS OB MY FLOCK- IT am wid sorrow in my heart, and drefful pain in my limbs, dat I find myseff cumpell'd to forego de pleasure ob lecturin to-nite to you. Ob late my helf hab bin as poor as my pockets, and ef I don't git no better fass, I'll hab to trow up (I don't mean emeticly spoken) my posishun-or as de preacherman's say, resine my call ober you. De fac am, I is sinkin in helf and funds daily, and derefore I rite dis to say dat ef you is not sassagefied, you kan git anudder shepherd as soon as sou pleese, as I is 'tirly too full ob rumatism and regret to fulfil my duty towards you. 'Spectfully yours, J. CESAR HANNIBAL. On the readin of this touching letter from the aged Pro- fessor, a young brudder behind a ruffle shirt and a large moustache, arose, and addressed the congregation in the following strain:   332        BLACK DIAMONDS. "BRUDDERN AND SISTERN- Fur de fuss time in my life, I rise to'speak in public, but' dis is sich a 'strordinary 'caishun, dat I wood feel as guilty as'f I had stolen a sheep, ef I war to set still and not gub my'voice in favor ob doin sumfin to help our worthy friend and distructor, Brudder Hannibal. For de lass four yeers, we hab sat under his weakly teachin, and all muss admit dat he has unlocked he dark lantern ob siance, and luffed de full lite refulgintly fall 'pon our beds. He hab labored till he am sick wid disease, and haff ded wid de rumatism. Derefore I say unto you, in de language ob de Pos'le Napo- leon, ' Let's go in and do sumfin fur him to help him out ob be trubbles,' " saying which, he used a very large white hankerchief in relieving the probosis, and sat down. Then an aged sister arose (whose name we learned to be Aunty Belcher), and in a very animated tone, thus address- ed the assemblage : "Ain't you a putty set ob niggars, to luff dat good ole man lay dere in dat seller, doubled up like a jack-knife wid de rumitism, when you all got 'nuff to eat, and mor'n 'nuff fur your own good, to drink. You young fellers dats got money 'nuff to go roan rasin de debil and eatin fried clams ebery night, why don't you shell out and do sumfin terable fur de ole man? I'll bet a half dollar chunk, dat I done more fur him sence he'm bin sick, den enny odder sister in de crowd-but I don't go and blow 'mong de gossipers and back-biters what I do. What I do, I do, and dats my bizness I kan only say I blush fur you all, wid all de cullar I got. Let's be up and doin, as de bumble bee sed to de tumble dumb beatle.

She had scarcely taken a seat, when a middle aged "brudder " mounted the desk and said  "'LADIES AND GEMMON- I spose I got a right .to spoke on dis question. Ef eny ob you doubt it, I'll gis tell dem smack in de teef dat I hab paid as much as eny odder member ob dis 'siety, to keep de ole Professor at our helm. Now I got somfin to say 'bout dat man dat you will all deter in ef you got common sense. In de fuss place you all know dat he hab done more to frow a hello 'round de kullar man, den eny cullard man libin." Several voices-" here, here, good."'

Now I'd like to ax dis kongregashun ef our ole belubed Professor ain't as good as eny ob dem fel- lers-he may not be, spiritly speakin, but as a bodily subjick, I say he am. Derefore I offer dis rebulushun to de crowd. I rit it myseff, and derefore I better read it myseff. Resolled, dat wharas our ole and long suspected shepherd hab bin sick and laid up on de shelf like a pair ob skates in August, for de lass six monfs, and wharas we look 'pon him as one ob de lites ob de age, in de dark walley ob sciance, we, his fellow citizens and members ob his 'siety fur de 'spresshun ob ignumrence and elewashun ob useless nolege   334        BLACK DIAMONDS. and fundimental science, do hereby pledge ourseff to raise 'fishent funds to send him to Urope, and that he goes forf- with directly immediately." Three cheers were here given by the people. The speaker continued-- { Now, my frens, dere am a fuss-rate chance to send de Professor wid a frend ob his. I larned lass nite dat de Editor ob de Picayune, who also hab bin sick a long time likewise, and who stops writein fur de benefit ob he helth and his reders, am a gwane to Urope on a tower ob obser- washun."

And den, my frens, see what adwadtage his trip will be to us. He will hab more sciance and knowledge to kommunicate den wood fill a sugar hogs- head. We would be de gainers by it, fur he would tell sich lots bout all he sees on de odder side ob Jordon. Shall we send him or not--dats de question?" Here the enthusiasm knew no bounds-the whole house rose- and cheered, and waived their hats and handkerchiefs, and cries of " yes," " yes," came from every quarter. Speaker- "I mobe de kollecshun be started dis nite. Sister Belcher-"I second de moshun."

CHLDREN OB SIANCE- A  CHCKEN pot-pie dinner, wid mince pie fiins cood- ent a bin more acceptable to your poor worn-out shepperd, den de recete ob your kind rebolution, wich you passed at your lass meetin. Your inwitation to go off to Urope onl a sea-woyage, hab cheered up my old wedder-beaten and most broken heart, and sent a frill ob joy clar doun in my stockings Ob all tings in dis world dat I hab wished, wus to be able sum day to cross de briery deep, and see old Mas- sa NeptUn, a riden on a see hoss, attended by a plattoon ob inaremaids, a dashin de wabes each side ob he chariot, wid a   five tined pitchfork.

I can assure you all, dat ef dar am enny siance worf knowin, I'll find it out and splain de hole ting, as plain as a pictur on a tea-bord. As soon- as I git your rebolushun, and felt sartain dat I   wus sure to be gwane, I mediately writ a note to de Edi- tor ob de Picayune in de followin strain :   336         BLACK DIAMONDS. "Anty Clawsons's, Most Nite. "Dear Sir-De members ob de 'Siety far de 'spresshun ob igno- rence and elewashun ob useless nolege, and fundimental Siance, whose teacher I am, as you am aware, hab, in consequence ob my long and severe sickness, koncluded to make up a puss to send me to Urope fur de benefit ob my institushun. And larnin in a direct way dat you, wishin a laxashun fur your own benefit, hab taken passage fur de toun ob Urope, derefore I ax you, as an old frend, to endebber to git me a passage on board de same ship wid you. You noe my 'stinguished position here, and I feel it woodertt be lowerin myseff a bit to go wid you. Ef you will name de ship you intend goin in, I will do my bess to honor it wid my kumpany. "Yours mity sick, "PROF. J. CESAR HANNIBAL." To dis note I recebe dis reply: "Prof. Hannibal-Dear Sir--I-should be rather pleased than oth- erwise with your company on my intended tour to Europe, as I may be enabled to extract much scientific knowledge from your over-stocked brain, on the passage. I intend to sail in the ship "Sunny Side," Capt Adams, laying at the foot of Pine street. "Truly yours,   ED. OF PICAYUNE." De day arter I git dis note I feel mity proud, and I rode doun to de aforesaid ship, and sure 'nuff; I found her 'tirely new frum stem to starn.  I crept up de ladder at de side, and ax fur de Captain. A gemmon cum up to me, and ax me what I wanted. "Captain Adams," sez I. "Well, sir, here I am," said the gemmon. "What," says I, "you de Captain?"    You see I wus sprised beyond all bribulashun at his 'pearance. I spected to see him in wite trowsers, wid he shirt hangin ober de top ob dem, wid a tarpolen hat on he hed, and a big spy-glass 'in he hand, gis like I seed de ship captain in de theatre, dat nite I go dar to study character-and on seein him widout   THE RESOLUTION.        33  no big whiskers, nor spy-glass, nor tarpolen, put gis dressed up in close like shore pepils, it stonished me, and I looked at him wid all de eyes I had in my hed, and specks too. As soon as I recubber myseff a little, I made de obserwashun dat I wus glad to find him a desendent frum de fuss family. Dat de Adams wus de fuss on record on spectability. He smiled, and sed "Yes." Dat kinder made us familiar, and I ax him ef I cood hab a passage on bord his ship, as an old frend ob mine and de fun lubbin public, wus algwane wid him, and I'd like to see Jorden wid him. "We can give you a steerage berth," sed de Captain. "De steerage," sed I, " dat muss be in de hind part ob de ship, nie unto where de man stands dat steers ship, arn't it?" "Not zackly," sed he, as he turned to de cook, a young cullard man, and ax him to show me de steerage. I soon cum to be 'quainted wid de cook-he herd ob me ofin-so I eluded to bunk wid him on de woyage. 'We went all ober de ship, and I found de royal poop deck in de rite place. De jib-boom wus dere too, and so wus de royal top gallan main sheet. De skuddin sail booms war all dar also, and dar wus de bow-split a stickin rite out like Horace Greeley's principles. De hen-coop wus rite, too. De main jib-boom, top sail tenor reefs and cross-sticks war all lashed to de stanupsticks. Ebery ting looked done up as nice as a sore shin in de Hospital-and as I liked de looks ob de hole kraft, I made a bargain wid de Captain afore I cum away. I told him dat de kommittee wood call and square de yards -I tort I put de sailor to him at once.

Sebril have sent to me fur my autograph and I is sorry I habent time to set far it, or I wood send one to all who mout wish it. Dere hab bin sich a call fur locks ob my har dat in one week I found my bed sheared as close as a sheep just arter sheerin time-in fact, it's clipped so tight dat I kan scarcely shut my eyes to go to sleep-and one low cul- lard man on de wharf, while I was gubbin orders 'bout my baggage, ax me ef I war trainin fur a prize fite. Dat made me mad, and I sed no more har goes off dis ole hed now how. So all dem sisters dat dident get no har, hab got to do wid- out har; fur I mass stop de rabages to preserbe de crop. It seems dat ebery tintg I got, am looked 'pon as a curiosity. Massa Barnum rites to me fur a suit ob my piole close to put in a glass case, in de Museum. I is sorry I only got one suit to my back, or he cood hab it. I happened to hab an ole pair ob boots, which de kongregashun gub me second hand 'bout two yeers ago, and I sent hi'm dem-so you fellers kan look out fur dem.

One brudder sends me a big second- hand tin bason, and sez I'll find more need ob it fur de fust week I'm out, den ennything else I got. He accompanies it wid a bottle of brandy, which he ses always follows its use. He tells me in a perlite note not to be afraid ob it, as all temperance societies am null and woid durin sea sickness. NI hope de followin pussons will except my tanks fur de followin tings: Aunty Belcher, fur two bottles ob brandy, a shillin worf ob doe-nuts, and a mince pie; Sister Florindia Pacilia Gemima Ferningham, fur tree jars ob sweet-meats, two pair of socks, a pocket handkershief, and a jug ob root beer; Sister Kate Lutts fur a dozen biled crabs, and haff a dozen biled eggs wid salt.

Well den to begin. You all nose when I left de warf on de 19 ob April, just as de bell in de soup house rung for dinner. Well, we bore down de bay as cheerful and as light as a butterfly in de sunshine. De passengers war a talkin wid dere frens on de poop deck, who war gwane to see dem off, and lebe dun at Staten Island. De stars and stripes whor a flyin' at de steam. De pilot was a gubbin orders to de man at de big weel what's fast to de seller door, a swingin' on behind to turn de ship round wid. De captain was a pullin' off his go to meetin doze and a puttin' on a free dol- lar and a half suit. De mate was arrangin' de watches ob de crew-so de steward sed-but I didn't see not one watch 'mong de hole ob dem. De steward was bizzy gittin up dinner, and I sat alone on deck. No frens come to lebe me at Staten Island, and put me to de 'xpense ob a dinner on bord-so dere I sat cogitatin and foolosifizein.

All dis time we was bein' towed wid de tugg, not a sail had been stuck out. After dinner de tugg come long side and de frens jumped abord, some a lafin, some a cryin, and some as grabe as an owl full ob huckelberrys. Soon as de tugg was gone,  de steward ax me in de caboose to dinner, but my heart was too full ob good-bye to eat, so I took my seat near de car- buncle, and kept under de American flag (where all good men can set down in peace) and watched de movement ob tings all round me. Now de captin was up to he eyes in biziness. He stood on de poop and sung out to de men to luff go de royal stilyards, hellyards and tanyards, and splice de main brace; den he wanted all de royal top balance sails. set, and den he gub dem orderso squar demseffs. All dis time de hind quarter and de fore quarter ob dQ ship was a tryin' dere best to see which cood dive deepest in de water and go up de highest in de air ; at fust I tort it was fun, and tort de bows had de best ob it, when I noticed dat de sides ob de ship had commenced de same game, and den it was down stern to up bows, and down bows and up stern, for ebber so ong. Presently my watching de fun kinder made me dizzy, ind putty soon de stripes on de flag begin to blow like a :orkscrew, and de stars seemed to snap and crack, and it seemed to wind itseff around my head till I coodn't hold it ip no longer. I sung out for my frind de steward, who said was sea-sick, but I node better, and I told him so; he, loweber, helped me to my birth and a tin pan, both ob vhich I clung to wid eagerness. I can't tell you zackly how felt, but I tort at one time dat my stomjack had been urned into a swill barrell and somebody was a stirring it up rid a long stick, which stick was in my troat and I coodent :it it up.

De fust nite wore away, but de next mornin' it was wuss.

"What's de matter?" ax I as loud as I cood holler. "Lay still, yoibloody niggar i" said an ole sailor. "We're in a gale, and want all land-lubbers in bed." Now dere was confusion. De captin run on de poop and sung out, " haul down de main sheets." At 4is a young lady in her berth screached out to know if de main sheets war on her bed, and she fainted. Another old lady, when de captin ordered all hands aloft to reef top stalls, begged to be excused as she didn't feel well enough to stir. I stagger- ed up to de hatchway to see whar de danger war, when a wave ob de sea come kersouze all obber me, and floted me back agin. All de passengers was now heavin, and as if dat wasn't-enough, de captin gub orders for de ship to heave too, and she hove too. De hen coop broke 'loose, and de chickins went to cackilin--de mate went to swarein-de wind howled-de rain fell-de men swore-de captin yelled-and you best believe I wished myseff back in Anty Clawson's seller, however humble it mout be.

I hadent bin walkin dar long befo'e I noticed dat I wus looked 'pon as a queeriosity, like de alagator in the Museum, and putty soon a feller in blue close wid wite buttons, behind a ledder stock, walked up to me under a hat bound round on de ages wid patent ledder, and sez he to me, sez he: "Your a stranger 'ere, I perceive, sir, and it mout be, you don't know that your a breakin von ob de regelations ob de military to be valkin 'ere; you must come hoff from there or I must take you hoff." "Why, who be you?"I 'dignently axed, "dat you dar 'proach a furrin gemman in dat style-it's next door, to a consult!" "I'm number 495, 1st section," answered de man. -', -" Section ob what!"I naterly axed. "Section ob police," said he, as stubbern as a nigger wid de sulks. "Well," sez I, wid all the fire ob my natur, your a pretty police to come up and coast me in dis kind ob style- don't you nose me?

"Why, to 'ear you talk sich nonsence as you do, about this 'ere parade, as the firin ob de cannon and the flyin ob the flags, wus all intended for you." "Why, in de name ob all dat is sciantific, wat is all dis fuss kicked up fur, if not fur me, sa-ay, ain't I 'ribed?" mildly inquired I. "Vy, for hour beloved Queen-you hold fool, don't yer know it's 'er birth day, and it's allers hobserved by a demonstrashun? And, hold feller, we'd show you a sight as you'd remember to go 'ome and tell, if the harmy wusn't gone hoff to fight the Rushers!" Well, when he told me dat, I felt de starch go rite out ob my shirt collar, and felt it wilt-I felt as cheap as tree cents a haff a peck, and I come to de 'clusion dat I'd bin sold ; so to end de matter I axed de policer in to take a drop ' ob "Barclay's entire." He took a quart, and he and I was sworn frens eber sence. He scorched me to a lodgins, and gub me all de inflammation he cood 'bout tings in general. When I went fur lodgins, de ole lady at fust sed to de policer dat she hadent a spar room in de house, but as soon as she see me she changed her mind. "Are you one ob thim poor hoppressed people Mrs. Butcher Store has so beautifully wrote on, from that bar- berous savage country, North America?" "Yes mum," sez I, wid an eye to de lodgins, and seein she was one ob de rite kind fur me to lib in klober wid. "Well," sez she, puttin on her specks, "in de name ob heaven, 'ow did you git away from them-'ave you bin beat- en much, or branded wid 'ot hirons, do let's look at you."   348        BLACK DIAMONDS. I frankly tole de ole woman dat I wasn't much hurt, and hoped to find a silum under her hospitel roof. "You shall 'ave the best room in de 'ouse," returned she; "there's honly a poor newspaper editor got it now, and 'e must take the hattick room till you leave, or he must leave altogether, I don't care which." I tanked her for her preference and due 'preciation ob de cullered man, and was shown to de room. I was not long in unpacking my wardrobe from de crown ob my hat, and makin myseff at home. How de editor and de ole woman settled 'bout de room I neber node, all I heard 'bout it was 'bout ten a clock de same night. I hear a voice, goin up stairs in big shoes, say-"I'm d d if I'll stand it, to be turned out, of my own room for a runaway buck nigger; I'll show her in the morning!"Dat's de lass I heard ob it ; ef he did show her its more dan he did heseff, fur he nebber showed heseff to me. In one day it got noised round de naborhood dat I wus riv, and de letters ob inwatations and de nabors flocked in from all quarters. I had inwite, de fast ting, to lecture at de Eggeaters' Hall in de Strand, de greatest temple ob Abolishunism and Deism in all 'Urope.

When I finished it I jumped into a cab and took it to de Arch Beship myseff, and as soon as he read my kerd he was " hat 'ome," so de feller in breeches and a peck flour on he bed tole me at de doe, I found de Arch Beship in a black gown and his studdy; studdy was de name on de do'e ob de room lte war in, and dats de way I node it. De  Arch Beship was berry kind and talkatif. He was ebedently pleased wid de letter, kaso he laff rite out in two or tree grins at a time, and when an   352        BLAJK DIA"NDS, Arch Beship laff you may bet your pile dar am sumfin in: de wind.

"I understand," obserbed de Beship, " all your lectures, except your allu'sion to a peculiar kind of soup which you seem to be very partial to, and which you might naturally expect at my table ; but which I could not pur- chase, the materials being unknown in this country, and it has caused me much anxiety." 'What kind ob soup was it sar?" ax'd I, 'sposin I had mentioned some new kind ob soup some time which I met somewhar. "Clam soup," said he. "Is it any better than ox-tail or Muligatawny?" k "Oh yes, indeed," sez I. "If de children ob Israel Put- nam, when dey war in de wilderness 40 days, hab only had a few hundred clams, tings would hab been better wid dem." "Where do dey grow?'T ax he. "All long shore," sez I, " and dar am two kinds, de soft shells and de hard shells." "Oh, I'm very glad you have called upon me," said de Beship, quite animated, "for you have elucidated a point upon which I have been bothered for years. I did not know what the American papers meant by 'lards' and 'Softs,' and was foolish enough to suppose. that they were the names of two political parties; but now I see they simply have reference to the peculiar shell of the clam.

You may some ob you hab nuff stuff in your bed to recomlect dat in my fuss 'pisle to you I kinder skoffed at de idia ob my comein back to you, and you may recom- member too dat I hinted like a broad-toed kick 'bout luggin in a wite wife. I can only tell my deah sistern, in order dat dar mines may rest easy in de tin-panum-as we say in Latin -ob de bed, dat I was only speckelatin, and dat dar am no truff in de rumor.  I'd just gub all dat may come in de sasser to-nite to some charity institushun, if I was only in de midst ob you, behind dat ole desk a poundin de true nolage ob, siance into your coconuts agin ; but while I is here, like Mr. Napoleon Bonny-part was at de Iland ob Elbow, in xile,   354        BLACK DIAMONDS. why I can only rite ob tings I see till de happy hour comes when you send me 'fishent funds to satisfy de crawins ob de human natur in de brests ob de sea captins-so dey will bring me home high and dry. I luft off whar I stoped in my lass 'pisle. You luff me I belebe at de Arch Beship ob Cranberry's, a taukin to him oni a confab 'bout hard claims. Well, to curtail de ting as de man did when he bit the pup's tail off, I dined dar on a dinner dat wood make a New York Alderman good natured for a week, and arter dinner I got his promise to induce me 'to de Queen's kort on de followin nite. Accordinly on de followin ebenin, de close from de feller I tole you aall 'bout who hires dem tings, come, and as good luck wood hab it, he sent a feller along to dress me up. Arter two 'ours hard dressin I war reddy-de only ting, 'bout de close dat I didn't like was de fack ob de caffs ob de tites being on de rong side for me. It war right behind when de fullness ob my caffs am on de outside ob de leg- some pepel's caffs am in de hed. As soon as I war reddy I flung myseff into a cab and off I started for de Buck ob Dukeingham's Palace. I rung at de doe and de Royal High Waiter luff me in as soon as he read my letter from de Lord High Arch Beship. I had a long train ob royal high fellers t o pass in de hall. Dere was a feller in purpil welwit wid flour nuff on his head to feed a young family a day. In fack, dey all went into the flour, and in my pinion, dat's one reson flour am so high-kase you know de ole sayin in de Almack, dat a wilful waiste makes a wofull want, and if dat aint a wilful waiste ob flour, den my calkalatin apperatus am out ob de siferin book. I ax'd de royal high waiter who de fat feller jis named was; he tole me he was de royal high Buttler to de Queen. He looked more like a Royal High Beef-eater to de Butcher. Well, as I passed on, I   FOURTH EPISTOL FROM 'UROPE.      355 incountered de Royal High Boot-black to Prince Halbert, be Royal High Knife cleaner, de Royal High Footman, de Royal High Coachman, and he was a Royal high feller, 6 foot 6 in he stockins. Dere were seberal Royal High odder fellers stowed round de hall, who looked as if dey held a sitewation to drink all de beer dey cood, and see how much de institushun ob mankind will carry about wid dem wid- out fallin in de gutter. Presently I war ushered into a big room, which beats all de gold and fixins I ebber did see, sich paintin, gildin, looken glasses, gold furniture, gold chairs, gold sofas, gold tables, gold shandilers, wid more den ten tousand lites in dem, and gold ebberyting all ober. When de door opened de lite and shine come out like a flash ob lightnin on a gooseberry bush. It was so bright it made me wink my eye, at which an old lady, who was a lookin at me, smiled and'put her fan up to her face. She was de Royal Dodger, or Dowger, or somfin like dat. All de fel- lers in de hall, and in fack, all in de room stared at me as if dey dident nebber see a cullerd man afore, and I gess dey dident in dese close and in dis place. Mind I call you, I wanted to back out as bad as ebber a rat wid his nose in a trap ebber did in he life. But it war no use; I'd put myseff in de close. I'd begged and todied to get dar as much as enny odder republican ebber did, putty near, and I was bound to blaze for once. When I got fairly into de room, I was astonished to see de pepil. Dere was de Lord High Chemberlin, who has charge ob all de chambermades. Dere was Lord Derby, de one who was named arter de celebrated race hoss by dat name. Dere was de Chandiler, de candle-maker dat I spoked 'bout in my lass. Dere was sogers in ebbery kind ob beauful close, and dere was rambassadors from ebbery country, in gold and broidered close-some wid wigs and' some wid not. Near me sat de Duchess of Sunderland,   356        BLACK DIAMONDS. "Uncle Tom's" friend, and soon, as she seed me, she ax all 'bout Mrs. Haireyt Butcher Stowe and Uncle Tom. She tole me dat de high cheer and gold fixins in one corner ob de room was de trone, and dat putty soon her Royal Highness wood enter tended by her mades of honor. While I was waitin for de show to come off, I ax de Dutchass who all de different folks was. She node em all. Dere was nuff Lords, Dukes, Barrens, Dutchasses, and Lord Highs, to keep a nation poor for ten senterys. Dey all bowed to me as dey passed, and if I dident spread myseff dat time den I don't noe how its done-dats all. Dere was a Royal High band on a big shelf fenced in wid gold bars in one corner ob de room, and dey played "God sabe de Queen," and odder libely airs, but not one darkey tune did dey noe. I pitied dar ignumnrence, but it war best, for jis as sure as dey a started a jigdese ole legs ob mine wood hab begun to break down in spite ob de debil heself. I felt jis like it. I had to wait a berry long time before de Lady Queen made her appearance, and you fellers will have to wait a week befoe I tell you how she looked or did, kase dis 'pisle am too long now. I larnt de most ob de Lords and Dukes names present, and if you behabe youseffs I'll send you a list, for it will be handy in namin de babies as dey come young into de world. You  e  best belebe, I'm in high company now. De Dutchass ob Sunderland hab wited me to dinner, and I'm a goin-sure ting. Now, my stihgy frens, open your hearts and pockets when de sassar comes to you for me, for mind me, it takes all I can rake and scrape to lib here. I kind a feel abub habin de sassar now a days.

Sich pep- perations for libin and fixin up to stay I nebber did see, as is fully apparent on ebbry hand fruout de emens Palace. Dese solid bits ob reflexshuns crossed de horisen ob my mind as I set by de side ob de Dutchass ob Sunderland awaitin for de Queen and her train to enter de room. You will recomlect dat you left me a settin dare at de, close ob my lass 'pistle. Well, arter settin dare 'bout a nour, de door ob de anty chamber wus opened, and de lord high cham- berm'aid rushed in, in close so tite dat he coodent laff, and raisin a wite stick wid a gould ball on de end ob it, he turned red in de face wid de effort, but he cood only get out two werds, and dem werds was-"De Queen." As soon as he sed dat, dere was a buzzin in de room, like stirrin up a nest ob bumble bees-fans clattered, silk dresses rattled, laces fluttered, handkerchiefs flourished, and all rose to dar feet as de grand cortage, or cordage-I forget which am rite-   BLACK DIAMONDS. entered de grand hall, which I discribe to your darkened intellecks lass week. De fust dat come in wus de 'lord hie chambermaid, a flou- rishin de stick afore mentioned; den come twenty ladies, dressed in wite and colored frocks, a walkin two by two, arm, in arm ; dey had nofin wid dem but fans and poker- hankerchiefs. Dey war de Royal high grand arch nose- wipers to de Royal family. Rite a behind dese she fellers come Prince Albert Coburg, lookin like a Dutch hurrah, arm in arm wid de lubly Queen; and den come four ladies wid touls on dere arms, a holdin up de Queen's trail; dby war high arch wipers to all de royal family too. Arter dem cum all de royal children, all washed and dressed up as if it wer de, Forf ob July; den followed some more wipers and washers, and den nobody else. As soon as de pesession com- menced to mobe in de room, de band up on de big shelf be- gin to play, and all de pepil jined in de train, walked round de room tree times, to show dere close-and wigs, den we all opened rite and left, and luff de Royal family 'proach de trone, where Her Majesty took a seat and a pinch ob snuff. Den all de folks bowed to de Queen, den to each other, and goe'd and set down agin. De Prince took his stand along side her Majisty, wid de snuff box. De Queen don't like him to mingle wid de ladies at kort, kase he am sich a debil ob a feller 'mong dem, and dey sich debil ob fellers 'mong him too. She keeps him berry. close to her apon strings, and for all dat dere am more young Alberts runnin' round London den wood fill a meetin house. tAs soon as the Queen was cleverly seated and all de Royal hie arch fellers had taken their stand cordin to Hoilo, de presentations begin-ebery body was introcomduced to de royal hie arch chambermaid, and he introcomduced dem to her royal hieness.

As I mobed up de room more den a hundred eye glasses took good aim at me, and de Queen herseff leveled a pair' at me dat must hab cost more den fibe dollars. Arter takin a good look at me, de Royal hie arch chambermaid told her my name. She knowed me at once, and said she was a constant reader ob my Lectures in de N. Y. Picayune, and complimented me bery hiely on my great nolage ob Science and wonderful sence ob human nature. She complained 'bout not gettin de paper regular, and gabe orders to de lord hie arch Stewat ob de Palace to pay me 4 shillin English money for a year's subscribe to de paper. She'll be sure to see it certin sure in future. I speck de Picayune folks will be mighty prowd ob dis fac. Arter axin me many questions 'bout my future corse in futurity, she induced me to all de children and de Prince; den I kissed her hand like de rest ob de crowd, and I fell back into obscurity to let a fat Dutch woman take my place. As I fell back I seed a door open to an ajoinin room, and I seed a long table filled wid 'freshments, and folks a goin into iem like a hungry crowd at a poor-house. I meg- itly boged for dat room,, and decway I laid in a supper and shampain was a kaushun to big eaters. Arter eatin and drinkin my full, I leff tru a different hall to what I entered, and I wer bowed out by at least a dozen big wigs and broad taild coats. I felt a little dizzy when I got to de treet, and I called a cab and told de cabman to dribe me home tru tilde Park. I got in de cab and off it roll'd. Dats de lass    360        BLACK DIAMONDS.

De darned drunken cabman had upset me in de lake. He had dumped me in and luff me to drown, for he was gone. You may bet your lass shillin dat I hollered sum. My hollerin soon brot a policer, and arter gettin a rope, fibe odder fellers, and a long hook, dey got me out ; but I was in a putty pickle. De man's close, wid all de gould 'broidery on dem, was spiled, and I stood dar as mad as a lunitic assilam. De police war gwane to take me into de stashion house, but on splainin tings, and dey findin out who I was, dey got anodder cab and took me home, when I treated all hans and went to bed. When I woke up in de mornin I found I hadent slept none all night, and all I dreamed 'bout was swimmin, Queens, sbampain, police, station-house, Dukeingham's Palace, and sich tings. I cotch a mity cold data so stoped de diagram ob de trout dat de borax woodent work, and I cood hardly speak in de morning for de broun critters in de oil factory canal. Dar, now, you got my sperence 'mong de nobilty and sich like-see dat you lay de moral ob it all to de flatterin unshun ob your soles, and hurry up de funds to bring me home.

De waiter understand jis nuff English to put him to sleep, so sez I, "Hab you eny soups?" "We we 1' sez he; " ze soup am ze potash." "No 1 no!" sez I, ' not potash soup, some odder kind; wat you got?"He handed me de programe ob de wittels, and dar I found out dat soup means potage. Dey had all kinds ob em-dar was "Potage de Tartar," made frum de juice ob tar barrels, I spose ; and dar was "Potage de Nigre," made out ob boiled niggers, I speck; so I turned from de page ob soups, arter lookin in wain for clam soup, in disgust to de more solid, and I begin to spell 'em out, and afore I node it I had absolutely grown humped back, busted my shirtcollar all to slivers, and split my bess trowsers, in tryin to makeout de crooked names; so I fell back and called for pork and beans, but not a pork had-dey--dey dident' noe him -so radder dan not starbe to deff, I jis pinted to de fust ting on each page ob de list and I got a fust rate dinner; tru it was cooked up so I coodent tell wedder I was a eatin frogs, rats or chickens, but I tort " notin wentured notin got," and went in. When I was full I feel better toward mankind in general, and French cooks in particular. De bustin ob my shirt   SIXTH EPISTOL FROM 'UROPE.     363 collar and its radder siled condition rendered it hiely con- sniptious dat I shood hab a new one afore I went to see: Lewis Napoleon, to whom I had letters ob deduction ; I seed shirts in de shop winder, so I boged in and I pantomi- micked to de feller (who seemed to be strung on wires) behind de counter, dat I wanted de shirt. He looked as wild as a hungry hauk at me; he dident noe wat I ment, and here I made the erful discubery dat insted ob my wearin a shirt all my life, I hab bin wearin a shimmeese. At home you noe only de far sex indulge in tiugs ob dat name, but in Paris ebbery man and woman wars de shim- meese, but de he-shimmeese am made jis de same as ober dar, and so am de she-meseese. Arter I bied de shimmeese I ax for a hotel, and I was 'sprised to find dat ebbc body's house was a hotel, so it was easy findin one. Thither I went and kinder slicked up a little to go and see Napoleon Lewis. At fust I was kinder fritend at de soger mans dat swarm de treets, and den arter I got ober dat, I had to laff at deir trowsers. Dey'm fust rate pants to steel apples in, I tell you; dey'm big nuff round de seat and legs to hold a bushel ob taters, and so tite at de bottom dat nofin kin fall out; a feller mite carry nuff provishions to last him a week in 'em and noboddy wood noe it. Dese fellers in dese trow- sers am all ober Paris, as tick as crows 'pon a ded hoss, and 'bout as bizzy. As soon as I spit on my boots and rubbed dem off wid my toof-brush (dat's a handy practice in trablin), I call'd a cab and dribed rite off fru de Bull Yards to de "Hotel de Fooleries," whar de Emprior am libin in klober-wid he young bride-de women am all arter Lewis- eben Quean Wictoria, de bold ting am 'bout presentin him wid her garter, so he kin judge ob de size ob her leg. Dis from de mudder ob sich a brood ob Alberts am hiely senuary. My pisle hab got so long I muss cut it off here,   364         BLACK DIAMONDS. as de doctor sed 'bout de sore leg-and stop. My enter- tainment wid de Emprior and odder tings I must lebe to some prebious 'caison to you about in de Picayune. Don't forgit de sasser, and belebe me as much French as posable. JULIUS.
