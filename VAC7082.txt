"' Of all that does adorn and grace and beautify creation, 'Tis WOMAN fills the fairest place and holds the highest station." ON the banks of a beautiful river in the southern part of the State of Alabama the scene of my story commences. 'Twas morning-a beautiful Sabbath morning. The blue vault above was calm and cloudless; no shunds disturbed the quiet of the hour, save the lowing of the cattle on the distant plantations, or the rippling ramumurs of the neighboring brook as the morning zephyrs breathed over its surface. '   . It was calm. and peaceful as the Sabbath, the day of rest, should be. Presently the village church bell began to chime and call the villagers to the house of God; and then the old mat bowed with years, and the merry little children, were seen wend- ing their way along the paths or across the green fields. Beautiful indeed was the siglit, as one and another came forth from their cottage homes dressed in their clean attire.  Come with me now, my belle readers, away over to yonder cottage.  Is it not a choice, beautiful spot? First, the white cottage-with the green vines -clinging to and running over it; then the pretty garden on one side; the orchard filled wi h choice fruit, and the fig-trees loaded with figs on the other. And then, in front, that beautiful, far-spreading lawn ; and back there, in the distance, the towering hills, the woodland, and, I almost forgot, this silvery stream running here close by, form- ing a most beautiful picture. This is the home of Emma Howard. Let us enter. There we see, sitting in a cosy chair, a matronly lady, wiping.: her spectacles preparatory to reading the Italy Book, Which         Y   4          EMMA HOWARD. lies open on her lap. She says to a sweet girl standing by her: "Emma, you had better attend church to-day; I can stay and not feel at all lonely, for I'll have the best of company, my Bible,"'  -"Well, dear grandma, I will go; I love the Sabbath, and the church and js"hol. )'Yes, I'll go; -still I would wish to stay with you--you will feel lonesomne." . .. "No, child, I will not; never fear." Emma was a fair, light-hearted girl of seventeen, possessing a mild, sweet disposition and a loving heart. Shle was beauti- fiul in face and fortm, and, withal, she had a benevolent heart. Hier father and mother were spending the fashionable season at the North, and she and her grandmotlher, with two white servants, "were 'all tlhat lnow lived in the cottage. Their negroes occupied a house neai by. "Now Emm'a is ready; let us follow her to church. There, just as she crosses the stile, she meets' her newly made friend- 'Jane Raiile,; of New York, who is spending tfli svlmnimer with lier aunt,-a near neighblor of Mr. Howard: They have a kiss, and then pleasantly, they clhat as they walk side by side.' But see! dyonder cdomns, quickly approaching them, two handsome young men.' As thley. meet they raise their hats, and "Good- morninig, ladies" is wiafted oil the breeze. One offers his arm to Miss Hloward and the other to Miss Rapley. At a glance, fair reader, you can see that those four are lovers. Yes, the two gents are st6pping a few weldks in this pleasant village, anld hlave during thei: siort visit become acquainted Withl Emma and Jane. They profess to belong to New York; and Einma, the heroine of my story,'lias accepted the proffered hand and heart of J. W. Hunter, and is to retrin n:witlih him to liis home in the Empire City, and on her anrival there is to become lhis wedded wife. "'Dear Emma," says Hunter, "soon we shall be very, very happy-will we not:V '  "Yes, dear' Walter; but there is a cloud hanging on my happiness." Kind reader, we will have Miss Rapfey for the present, and follow Emma; but mark well those words, "There is a cloud hanging on my happiness." ,O   Skip we over the week, and soe,h ov tilings are. A ay :party, is assembled at the house of Mr. Howard. Emma and Walter; are receiving .t}!eqnppgratulations of friends pxreidius t'biddihn them adieu, as they are about t Jleaeo for New.

Now, dear reader, come with me to. the OCrescent Gity..

Hunter en'gaged a state-room, and .the. unsuspecting Emlma was shown to it, little thinking that it was:the intention of himn shb loved, of him for whom she had left home, friends, and all; that was dear to her on earth -little: did' she think, lhim so ,base, so void of humanity, as to allow,one vile thought to enter his heart.; but, alas! she soon found him out.

"Villain 1" said the captain, " what are your intentions toward this innocent female who stands before you '" "Oh, oh, cap-captain, I wa-was only trying her strength. I alnen--engaged to be married to her-that's all." The forgiving Emma, with love beaming in her eye, and believing what he said, broke the silence by saying, Walter, you try me too hard--you hurt my feelings. I am unused to such treatment." "Never mind, de-dear Em ma, I ask your forgiveness-I'll never give you reason to be mistrustful of me again. I love you more ardently than ever." "Walter, I forgive all," said Emma. The captain, with a reprimand, left the room, saying that if he heard any more such work he should put him in a "tight place." Walter now made up with Emma, for he well knew that he could not accomplish his vile intentions on board that steamer; Aothe made up his mind to retain her unbounded confidence until they arrived in New York, and then manage to carry out his vile purposes. And how did he succeed:? let us see. On their arrival in New York they took rooms at the Irving House, where: they remained two days, in which time Hunter engaged board in a respectable house of ill-fame, in Fourth, Street; he then informed Emma that he had found a. beautiful boarding-house where they would'board together a few days until they were united in the holy bonds of matrimony, whean they were'to commence housekeeping. She left the Irving House and went to this new abode. Emma was shown to her room by the very accommodating Mrs. B---, and Walter was to :occupy a room joining. That night Walter did not return home until near midnight. Emma retired early; but about twelve o'clock was awakened by Walter at her door. She arose and asked who was there. "'Tis me," said Walter; "I wish to see you a moment." Emma slipped on :her dress: and opened the door. Walter walked in.  "'Dear Emma,-said Walter, as he took a seat on the side of   EMM1t -A a^WAR;D. the bed, and placed his arm around her waist, "we are soon to be married why may we not now enjoy eachi other's society i There are no other boarders in the house so why can we' nol room together-no one will know it, and it will be much more pleasant for us to be together."  "It may be pleasant for us to be together. It might, b more pleasant for you. than for me. I like your society, and wish to be with you always, stilI I will not allow myself te take one step knowingly that I may hereafter be sorry for," said Emma. "Then you will not allow me to remain with you to-night ': said Walter. "No! never shall you, or any other man, remain in my chiam- ber with me a night, until I am his lawful wedded wife," said Emma. "You are in my power," said Walter, sternly, "and I will not permit you to leave this chamber until you have complied with my request." '"Ah, Walter," said the beautiful Emma, "that Ilove you is true, but, sooner than permit you to take one wrong step, yes, sooner than tamely submit to your hellish design-I will revel in my own heart's blood." "I see you are excited. I will leave you for this night; but never again shall you leave this room till you have complied with my wishes. I shall lock you in, and no person will be allowed in your presence. You may remain here' alone, and when you comply with my request, ,I will make you happy," said the villain, as he rose to leave her presence. "One word, dear Walter," said the loving girl. ' For yo I left home-you whom I thought to be an honorable -man-yyou whom I loved as my own life. You now seek my ruin. That you can never accomplish. You may leave me, you may lock me in this room; but I will die by my own hand be- fore I will comply with your vile request. Tamper not with my love, for should you go too far, my love- may be turned to hate." "I care not for your hate or your love,"- said the libertines taking the key to the door; "I shall now look this door, and to. morrow night you must comply with my wishes, or I leaveyoUi to -          -       *e   3  1    tsLMLA HOWARD. your own fate here among strangers." So saying. he closed 'ald Tocketd the door -and' went to his own chamber.  Emma retired to her bed; but not to sleep. She thought it better for her never to see the man again who attempted her ruin. She had about five hundred dollars in money, which her grand- mother gave her when she left home. She said to herself: ' I will burst from this room to-moriow and find me another board- ing place for a few days, until I can return to Alabama." The next morning she burst open her door, placed a twenty-dollar bill in Mrs. B---'s hand, and went out to the corner of the .street, engaged a hack, and with her things was conveyed to the Howard House, where she intended to remain until hhe returned *t: Alabamal The next afternoon she tpok' an omnibus and rode uip Broadway to Union Square. She did not return toward her hotel until near dark. Taking an omnibus she went down Broad- ay  resting her eye toward the side-walk she there saw Val- telt with a lady on his arm; they turned-.ijato Houston Street. Quick as thought she pulled the driver's straptlighted from::the omnibus, and followed them to:a light-colored brick house, oppo- site the church.. Walter and the lady entered; Emma remained ontside until the hour of midnight, but they did not come out. Walking up the steps, Emma rang the door-bell,: and a good- look'gi lady dpen&d. the door. .   -  "i c Madam'?;, said Emiima, " will you please inform me the naen of the lady of the louse 9'." :-4 Lord," answered the lady.  .  "    ,*,/Ishe in,?'"Asked Emma. -  -"I am her," answered the lady; ."willyoun walk .i, miss." 1 Emma entered;ltl, hall.; then taking a fifty dolar bill from her purse she handed it to Mrs. Lord, and asked to bhe slown to the ehaaiber where Walter and: the fair one were iasleep. M- Ms. Lord showed -her to their chamber. - Emma softly entertd the room;; and drawing the curtains. aside,: she there saw Walter 'aind: tihe- woman embraced in each othera arms, sound asleep. Sh- did not disturb them. Saying to herself that she would seek revenge on him for the wrong done her in attempting her pruihi; she left, arid returned to her room in the HEoward Houise. -;.The next day 'she sent the following: note to Walter, dilretedl to the care of Mrs. B--, in Forfth Street. * SI   EMMA HOWARD.            9: r friday Morning. MR. IIUNTER:  Sir-I stole fromn my-room' and foiled you i ,yourm hellish design; at the lhour of twelve last night I stood y. your bed and saw you and your paramour in each other s enbr,ace. asleep.  You sought my ruin-you did not accomplish, it; for the wrongs  you have done me I hall seek, shall have, revenge before I die., You can not see me again.         * I '. EMA. Emma learned that Walter desired, a confidential waiter. She then laid her plans. to dress in disguise, engage as his servant, learn his accomplices in his counterfeiting operations, and bring him to justice. In the disguise of a 'Southlern d;arkry she applied for the situation. Walter engaged her. She assumd' the name of "Pompee."  Walter now. made "Pomlpee'" his. confidential servant. The next week Walter went to Albany. While there, "Pompee" 'wrote to a friend to have him telegranp on in Walter's na'me for him, to come to Albany. The net day "Pompee" received the following dispatch:  . . :  :  4i DE;tVAN HOUSE, ALBAiYh, 2 p. M/ Pompee, come up to-night, I am very sick -makeno delay. "Pompee" put this dispatch in his pocket, rifled the room at Mrs, B----s; in Fourth Street, of a large amount of money, and started for. Albany, 'where' he found. Walter in fine spirits, but greatly surprised to learn-that "Pompee" htd .been decoyed there by a forged telegraphic dispatch. They both started for New York that night. Walter was greatly excited when he found that his rooms .had been rifle d, but did.-not mistrust his faithful servant "Pompee." Previous to this, Walter had fallen in with a miss whom he had taken to his room in Fourth Street, and kept as his mistress. Soon after he fell. in with an old friend who introduced him into a family in Washington Place, by the name of Wetherbee.. He soon,became enamored with Miss Caroline, the daughter of Mr. Wetherbee. When he returned to his room that night, he told Maria (his mistress) about Miss Wetherbee, that he was going to lay his plals to get her away and commit her rlmn,   g1o     '   SEMMNA HOWARD. and to accomplish this he would introduce her to Caroline as his sister, and after they became acquainted, invite Caroline to visit Newport with them. In due time the above arrangements were completed. ",Pom- pee" learned all their plans, and then. laid his own to defeat them. Learning the day Walter was to start with Maria and Caroline, he informed the chief of police of the facts, and had two officers in disguise to accompany them. That evening "Pompee" was sent to inform Miss Wetherbee that she would be called for the next afternoon.  What was "Pompee's" surprise to behold his uncle at the door!"Pom- pee" left his message, and was not recognized by Mr. Wetherbee as his niece Emma. The next afternoon a carriage with Maria and the fair Caroline drove to the steamer Bay State, where was "Pampee" to wait upon Walter on his intended excursion. A well-known wink from "Pompee" soon convinced the two officers who Walter was. The boat soon left the wharf, and proceeded on her course up the East River. Walter entered the ladies' cabin with a note in his hand; walking toward Maria and Caroline, he said, "Ladies,as the boat was about leaving the wharf, a messenger brought me this dispatch," and opening the note he read as follows: FALL RIVER, 3 o'clock, P. M. MR. J. W. HUNTER-Your brother is but just alive; haste tc his bedside if you would see him again. WELLINGTON CLARK. Need I here state that this was a forged dispatch got up by Walter for an excuse not to stop at Newport, but to go direct to Fall River, wEere he thought he could better accomplish his damnable purpose. About ten o'clock that night a storm set in, and the gallant captain thought best to bring his boat to anchor. The storm did not abate until the next noon, and it was near nine o'clock when they arrived at Fall River. The party at once took a carriage, and were driven to the Mount Hope House, where tea was provided for them; after   EMMA HOWARD. which Walter informed Maria and Caroline that his brotl lived about two miles distant, and desired them to accompa him to his bedside. The three entered a hack, and soon were driven, fury-lil through the streets. "Pompee" and the officers at once pi cured a carriage and followed them. After turning a number streets, Walter's hack left the city on the old " post road" let ing toward New Bedford. At last the hack turned off from t main road toward a house standing all alone in the center of spacious field, surrounded by large trees, whose limbs stretc ing out on every side enveloped all below in gloom -and dai ness.  The carriage approached the building, from the door of- wh a tall clownish-looking fellow advanced to let down the sth and show' the party into the house. Caroline alighted fro the carriage and inquired, "Where is he?" "In 'the house," answered the man, whom we shall tct Siksey, taking her hand and leading her in. They crossed the threshold of the door, which instantly close behind them with a loud noise. "Have yonu no light?" she exclaimed, for they were in dar ness.- "Where are my companions 87" "Drive on," shouted a voice loud enough to-be heard witho- "4 drive on." The next moment Caroline heard the rattling of the wheels ( the carriage as it left the house, leaving her to become the victi of a base libertine. "What is the meaning of this V" she said. At- this mon the hand Qf some one was laid across her mouth to shut op breath and silence her cries.' "Heavens!" she shrieked; " what do you mean, to do I U1 hand me, sir." Her hlalf-stifled cries were now wholly silenced. by a heai blow from the fist of Siksey, who, with a low curse, exclime, as he raised her up, "Those kind of noises don't do here, n beauty, so take that, and learn that a still tongue betokens a wig heart."- Throwing one arm around her, the rnffian lifted her up, an opening a door descended a staircase leading to a deep cella   12         IEM M X H r'0 W "A u D. Herej, from a dim -laitern, afifaint light spread through the gloom; hurrying her along;toward the far-corner of 'the cellar, he threw her down on the cold, damp earth.    . "Stay there,"'inuttered the wretch, as he turned to retrace his steps, "'till I receive further orders. You wanted your man and how you have got him." Two deep groans and a sigh were all that he received in reply as he ieascended the istaircase. Scarcely had he reached the top. when thedolas were burst open with a quick, loud crash, and two. men (the fbflicers)j armed to the teeth,and one bealinga dark lantern in his hand, rushed in, and as they entered fell upon him.  "Pinion him ; bind the black-mail rascal fast, and while. you takeimin to the:carriage, I'll go for lthat Walter," shouted one of :thenm, as with a heavy whip he struck the ruffian senseless to the floor. Thera dashing fury-like,:he found Walter secretedl in a closet in the third sthry. With one blow from his whip-handle he brought hinm to the floor; and dragging him down to the door, the two scamps werel. ound arid placed in the carriage and left in care obf- e' of the officers,' whl'e' "'Polnpee" and -the otler went in search of the/unhappy Caroline. They soon found her, and'gefitly- lifted ; herup 'and conveyed her to another carriage. Then the two officers took'.the carriage containing the/two plis- oners. and rettirned to' Fall River, whereWalter and the wretch Siksey woere placed in the narrow cells of the prison f.. "P om- pee" took charge: of Caroliie, and had her conveyed to the hMbuht Hope Hlouse. Maria had, returhed in the same Carriage that conveyed the party out, and now the officers went insearch oger.. Thley shon. found heratthelle hotel, and at .once con'veyed h   b the lock-uip. Information of all of the above fajctsW wei'e at 4oice dispatched by telegraph to the chief of the- NBew York p0lice-hand then, and not till then, did "Pompee'" and the offi- cers betake themselves to repose.  ^    ' '* .  Thd next day Walter and . the other -wretch and .Maria w4re on thelr way to New York, in charge of the two officers; while Carolin e in charge of "Pompee," took: the first conveyance after. them. -On arrivingn   New York, "Ponmpee', conveyed her to her father's house in Washington Place, and bidding her'adieu, leftoherr;to tell her own story. -     .  ' - : Now let us go to the -Halls -of Justice. Here sits .the :magis- , \   EMMA  HOWARD. trate; in the prisoner's box sits Walter and the dther two Siksey and Maria. The wretch Siksey is proved ghilty of assai and battery, and is sentenced to Sing-Sing Pi'ison for one yei Walter and Maria are requested to stand up. -The miagistrate, a loud, hoarse voice, addressed them thus: ' You, sir, with your mistress, I have no, doubt intended ruin that innocent girl. Your plans have failed; and throun all agency higher than yours, the poor innocent female who you plotted to undo is saved, and is now at her father's house You can now retire, and thank Heaven that I have not been en bled to catch you in no act that would warrant your arres Go ;' he pointed them to the door, and the wretches crawled like whipped curs from the apartment.  From the Halls of Justice, Walter went to his rooms in Fourt Street.    ' On enterirg the room, he exclaimed, throwing himself into chair, "The last plank is kicked from under me, and I stand i the midst of darkness and hell. Oh! is it not a glorious finish to a career like mine? Baffled at every point; my schemes on after another. laid bare; my instruments successively: arrested and entombed; myself robbed, thwarted, and exposed,;::  caught almost in the very act, and brought ;before the heSa the police. Great God I great God!" and with these exclal tions of agony the'wretch buried his head in his hands and bow forwardl as it were in distress.  "Thils :baffled, thus: defeated, thus hurled into the midst 0 ruin," he continued, "what-what will become of me; Davi and the rest will cast me from them. . With my name and pei son lknown to the po lice-cast off from. help, sympathy, arm means, oh, imy God-! what will become of me!  I shall b, left in the midst of gloom and darkness, with no outlet by whici to escape-.no torclh to light me out of this darkness by whiel I am surrounded! My God, what am I to do!" r    . In: a nervous excitement he paced the room, and strove in vail to recoverhis usual equanimity, .  ;-'      : . , "In this I see the hand of my secret enemy ., Oh! that Ihac him here at my. feet now--how I'd tear-' himl' Yes, .as' th( wolf grasps and riots in- the flesh of the frightened and unre sisting lamb, so would I grasp, so. tear, and so revel in his hearti'   "        EMMA HOWARD. blood, till I had rent him piecemeal and scattered him to de- struction. O God-spirit-devil, or whatever thou art that swayest the eternal destinies of man, but bring me for one mo- ment into the presence of my destroyer, and then do with me as thou wilt-I ask no more." In the excitement his appearance was frightful in the extreme. ,An accidental glance in the mirror as he traversed the room in his disorder, startled him. "I must stop,"' he exclaimed, "I must not let it affect me thus, or I slall go mad. No-I must be cautious-for calamities a thousand times less overpowering than mine have hurled men into lunacy ere now. Yes, I must be cautious." In a few moments he became more composed, and stretching himself on a sofa, he sought the calmness only found in repose. That evening he sent the following letter to his friend: . No. 372 FOURTH STREET, Thursday Evening. COL. DAvIs: My dear Co.--I hardly know how to write you: I fear my game is nearly up--that my' career is well-nigh run. For the last few'weeks mischance and ill-luck have attended all my oper- ations;. My men have not, so far as I can judge, betrayed me; and yet my plans have been laid bare by some foul traitorous MhM, and myself defeated at almost every point. I know not, dream-not, of the cause or causes of this, and have no data, no grounds to go. upon to fasten suspicion on any ore. And yet it is evident that I have been betrayed, and equally as evident that I have some secret enemy, who is bent upon my ruin and de- struction. Who that person is I know not-whether male or female I know not, suspect not, and have not the slightest means of determining. In vain do I rack my brain to discover whom I have trusted, whom offended, or to whom I have confided the secrets of my business. I can think of no one in whom I have confided, can call to mind no one to whom I have revealed my secrets and then offended, and thus furnished with the power and inclination to thwart my plans and work my ruin. And yet it is a fact not to be shirked or disguised, a bold, stout fact that it were folly in me to slight or treat with ridicule or disdain, that I have an enemy-one who is aware of all the details of my   EMLMA. HOWA1D    - . plans and schemes, and at the same time one who has the incli- nation to balk and baffle me-the heart, too, soured or embit- tered by some real or fgncied wrong to work 'my ruin, and the courage to attempt to carry it out. I fear that some one from whom we have extorted money--"black mail"-or exposed through life, is at the root of all my trouble. The power of this enemy is the greater from the fact that he or she works calmly and silently, without letting me know by word or hint who or what he or she is, or what I have done to drag down upon me. this terrible, this mysterious revenge. -I am met at every point, defeated at every point, and yet can form no idea as to whom to attribute the successive checks and-disas- ters which assail me everywhere, and almost every hour. That you may form some idea of the knowledge and power of this a8 yet my unknown foe, permit me to itemize the results of the last few days    . On Monday night I went to Albany, and while there my faith- ful servant, "Pompee," was decoyed there by a forged telegraph dispatch, which was sent on in my name; and while he was-ab4 sent, the house was entered, and my private chamber was robbed of nine hundred dollars--and, what is more strange, the watches and jewelry, of which there were at least some four thousand dollars worth, were left untouched. On Wednesday I visited my woman for the purpose of obtain-, ing a pack of cards I had left for her to mark; for I had an en- gagement that night with Collan, the well-known handsome gambler, who was flush, and I hoped to win enough from him to make up the losses I had sustained ad the hands of my un- known- foe. Would- you believe it-I rosi from the table a loser, even with -.my marked cards, to the amount of eleven hundred dollars. 'The playing took place at my room in Fourth Street, no one being present except my faithful servant, ' Pompee," and ourselves, and yet I lost. -           . This was not enough to satisfy my hidden, but very active foe.          .  On Thursday, as you will learn in a few days from the public prints, "One Eye'---the splendid marker of our bogus bills- was taking an evening stroll, when the liand,of one of Matsell's troupe was laid upon his shoulder, and himself invited to the   16    -     EMMA HO WARD. Tombs. About the same time, my private rooms in Eldridge Street were invadedL by a posse of polices and watches, jewelry, bogus-press, and chemicals, with a lot of other valuables, were seized, and taken to Matsell's office. Fortunately uo one was at home at the time, and no live cap- tures were made. 'A short time since I tas introduced to a beautiful miss by the name o0 Wetherbee.- introdueed Maria to her as my sister, in- Vited her to a pleasure trip to Newport, etc., in company with fara ' alud^nfybelf. It was my Inteniticin to; get her off at a dis- fanee,/decoy her to obme secluded place,'thbre seduce her, and tive her for my :mistress. We started under-pretense of going to Newport, but' evnt to Fall River; from there to a secluded place.

After writing the above lie retired to bed. The next morning he was quite unwell, and did not leave his room; he sent for a physician, and was confined to his bed about two weeks. His friend Davis came on to New York, and took rooms at Tamnmany Hotel. The evening he arrived, instead of going to see Walter, he went to a fashionable ladies' boarding-louse -situated in Leonard Street. There happened to be a young lady boarding at the ihouse who was from Boston. She at once recognized Davis as the black-mail extortioner, and informed the landlady who the red-nosed visitor was. Not allowing ]ead-less beasts in her house, she took a champagne bottle in her hand and invited him into the hall. The servant opened the door and the mistress pointed him to the street, at the same time breaking two bottles on his head. Two officers assisted the beast into the station-hlouse, where he was obliged to remain till morning. In the mean time it got noised around that the black-mail editor was in the city. The "Short Boys". collected at ten o'clock -for the purpose of administering lynch law to the beast; but he was not to be found. It happened. that a woman who assumed the name of Phillips-and -kept a den of infany in Crosby Street, and hiring her place of,a man by the name of IRoocks, an extensive clothes dealer, and ' who acknowledged a tailor 'as her "fancy an" during the absence of her lawful rhusband in California--was acquainted with Davi-- nceeboarded with is yretened wife when she kept a house of ill-fame 'on Portland, Street; Boston, previous to his boarding with her; she had attended her when *one of her children came into the world, with no one to father it.. This woman Phillips, on learnin-g that Davis was in danger,-at once sent her tailor to find him and warn him of the danger that awaited himn in case the New York boys shiould get their hands on him. The tailor found him and took him to this woman's den * .  2   18         EM MAX HO-WARD . in Crosby Street, where he was kept hid for two days; he then managed to sneak up to Thirty-first Street, where he stole on board thile New Haven" cars, and left for Boston. That was his last visit toI New York-and it is the last time he will ever visit New York and leave it a live man. Dear reader, excuse me for the time wasted on this vile puppy. Now let us return to Walter. At the expiration of three weeks lhe became able to leave his room'; -lhe now made up his mind to take a trip to Canada; he had a little money left, and he deter- mined to try his luck among the Canadiennes, and see if he could not contrive some plan to swindle a few thousand pounds from them. While in Alabama he had borrowed nine hundred dollars from Emnmas grandmother, on the promise of'returning it to her as soon as he arrived in New York. This amount he had placed in the Canal Bank at New Orleans; he now sen t by express, and drew that, and then started for MJontreal. He had  not seen "Pompee" since they arrived at Fall River, and sup- posed that he had been imprisoned for participating in the affair at Fall River. C"Pompee," after leaving Caroline Wetherbee at her home in Washington Place, had resumed female dress, and taken board at Mrs. Gardner's, in Bayard Street, and watched the movements of Walter up to this time. The next day she learned that he had started for Canada. She at once made up her mind to fol- low him. That night she left New York. On her arrival in 3'Iontreal she took rooms at the Ilotel des Ottawa ,:Rue Grand St. James. She confided in Mr. Martin, the very polite book- keeper at this house, and told him her business; presently J. H. Daly, Esq., the very popular conductor of the Donganna House, called at the office of the Ottawa. SMr. Martin inquired of Mr. Daly if a Mr. Hunter from New York was stopping at his house, at the same time giving a description of him as Emma had to him. ' No!" answered Mr Daly; "I believe there is no person by that name; but there was a man resembling the description came yesterdayi and left this morning to go up the river by the way of Lachine, and I think he is going up the Ottawa; he en- fered his name as Asa J. Jonson." The next morning Emma enga ged a private Cartes (as they are called in Canada), to take her-in pursuit. On their arrival at   EMMA HOWARD.           19 Lachine, Mr. Laflamm, at the hotel, informed them that such a man went up the river the day before. Arriving at Point Claire, they took dinner at Vosburgh's hotel; here they learned that Walter had gone through there the day before, in company with Harris' express agent. Emma fol- lowed on to St. Ann's, and along up the Ottawa to St. Andrew's. There she crossed the river to Point Fortune; here she could not get track of Walter, so she went on-to Hawkesbury, where she remained over night at Ouimett's hotel. The man she engaged at Montreal desired to return the next day, for fear his horse should get beat out. The next morning Emma engaged a Mr. Frasher to take her to "Original, where she engaged S. .I. Cushman, Esq., agent of Harris' express, to convey her to Bytown. On their arrival at Petite-Nation, Mr. Parker, the justice of the peace, informed them that such a man stopped at his hotel the night before, in company with another man who used to drive one of Harris' express teams, but he could not tell whether he. went up the river, or turned down the South Nation River. Cushman and Emma went on about thirty miles. up the river to Cumberland; not hearing any thing here of Walter, they crossed the river to Buckingham; here they met a man by the name of George Dun- ning, who had come up the river the day before; they inquired of him if he had seen such a man as Walter, at the same time giving a description of him. Mr. Dunning informed them that he met a man bearing the description givenrgoing down the South Nation River, near Plantagenet, the day before. Mr. Cushman here gave his horse some oats, and started down the river Ottawa, until they came to where the South Nation branches off at Petite-Nation. They went down that river, and arrived at Caledonia Springs about eight o'clock that night, hav- ing rode about one hundred and ten mliles that day. As Mr. Cush- man could not convey Emma any farther, she engaged Mr. Wil- kinson, the very polite and accomodating proprietor of the Springs, to convey her to Vanelex Hill, about nine mniles distant. When they arrived here, Mr. Johnson, the. landlord at the hotel, in- formed them that their man stopped there the night before, and started very early that morning to go down to Rivibre-de-Grace before the ice began to melt to injure the sleighing.   20         EMMA HOWARD. She remained here that night, and in the morning engaged Mr. Johnson to convey her to St. Ann's. On arriving at Regald, the proprietor of the hotel, Mr. Duffy, informed them that a man such as they described dined at his house the day before. They hastened on till they arrived at Point-A-Caignal. Here Captain Schneides, of the glass-works, informed them that the described man passed there the night before. Firom here they went to Vau- dreuil, and from thence across the "Lake of Two Mountains': to St. Ann's. 1Here they learned that a man of the description given stopped there the night before, and had crossed early in the morn- ing to the Isle-of-Pedro, where he had taken passage on Weller's line of stages for Toronto, U. 0. Emma now concluded not to follow him, but to lay her. plans to get around ahead of him on his route, and meet him. The next morning she took the stage for Prescott, where she crossed the St. Lawrence to Odgensburg ; friom there she went to Water- town, and took the cars for Rome; here she remained over night at the American House, and in the morning went to Syracuse, and stopped at the. Empire House. In the evening she was sitting in the ladies' parlor when a lady came to her, and inquired if she did not have the pleasure of meeting her on board the steamer from New Orleans to New York. "I came on board a steamer from New Orleans," replied Emma. "Miss Howard, I believe," returned the lady. "That is my name," answered Elnma. "Mrs. Ashy is my name," returned the lady. "Oh, yes, I remember you now,"' said Emma. "How have you been?" "Quite well, I thank you," replied Mrs. Ashy. "I had the honor to meet Mr. Hunter, the gentleman whom you were with, yesterday." "Indeed; where did yoiu meet him?" inquired Emma. "He is quite unwell at a hotel in Auburn-Taylor's hotel, I think it is," answered' the lady. Emma did not wish to ask any more questions, but bidding the lady good-night, she left the-parlor and retired to her room. She looked at her watch; it wta. 1- ihllt o'clock. She rung   E M M A H O W A RD.        21 the bell for a servant, of whom she inquired the time the next cars left for Auburn; at ten o'clock, was the answer. She sent for her bill, settled it, and at ten took the cars for Auburn, where she arrived about twelve o'clock. She took a hack and ewent to Taylor's hotel; had her name en- tered as Charlotte'Day. She then retired for the night. In the mnrning she did not appear at the breakfast-table, for fear she might meet Walter-as she was not prepared for him. She had her breakfast broulght to her room; she then rung the bell, and had the clerk come to her room ; she was informed that a man representing Hunter was stopping there, under the name of How- lett. She stated her business in as brief a manner as possible, and requested that the head of the police and two of his aids be sent for. The clerk left, and in about an hour three officers came to her room. She soon told them all concerning herself and Hunter. The head one said he had heard of Hunter before; he told Emma to enter Iunter's room, which was joining, and they would re- main in her room, and if Hunter made any attempt to harm her to alarm them, and they would take him into custody. Emma started to go to his room. At that moment he opened his door to come out, and met her in the door. "Good God, you here!" he exclaimed. "How knew you of this, my retreat?" "As I know all things relating to you,"' answered Emma. "Think you a man can hide aught from woman. Know better. We wotnen, however much we may be tampered with, are not the soft, credulous fools you take us to be:" "But how is this?" said Walter, pointing to her dress, "you . are in a traveling dress!" "'Tis true; I am here to say farewell ere I leave you forever,"'$ replied the beautiful woman. "Ha, ha! more of it," exclaimed Walter, with a laugh. "The noise of mn secret enemy has reached even to your ear. Iumph-! Well, Why should you be any more faithful than my fortunes. They have fled me, why should not you?" "You are better, sir," observed Emma, calmly. ' Sir-sir,".repeated Walter, haughtily. "So iihas come to sir between us at last. 'Well, why not, why should I look for an   22         EMMA HOWARD. endurance of your love? You find me tottering, trembling, fall-  ing, rushing down hill as fast as a secret but powerfill foe and an adverse fate can hurl me; and in an instant your love, that was warm before, like as a young bride's in her honeymoon, suddenly becomes cold--nothing was left of it but flle memory.'7 "And whom have you to thank for it?" asked Emma, sternly. "Myself, doubtless," answered Walter satirically, "since for- tune and a relentless enemy have- stripped me of every thing- yes, of my pride." "You say right," answered Emma, coolly. "You have your- self to thank for it all. Had you never been false to others, you would not have fallen into the net which is around you now. Ask your -false, villainous, treacherous heart if it could have expected any other fate. I repeat the question," said Emma, looking him fill in the face; "what other fate than this in which I find you could your false heart have ex- pected i'" "Nay-go on, woman. Spare not, I can endure all things- ruin, destruction-aye,.even your reproaches. Go 6n-go on," said Walter, mockingly. "I came, sir, to ask if you were satisfied with your connection. with her whom you found happy, innocent, and contented at her home in Alabama, on the banks of the beautiful Perdido?" "Quite, quite,ite answered Walter. "You have cost me but little, taking into consideration the nine hundred I borrowed of your granny before we left Alabama. I think I may say I am satisfied, although I intended to have made you my mistress; but as you were so stubborn, I concluded that you were a ' bad subject,' and that you might slide." "Heartless to the last, even in his misery," muttered Emma to herself. "And is it thus-in the light of a mistress you first looked upon me?" "Candidly, yes," replied Walter. "Think you, woman," he added, contemptuously, " that a soul like mine could stoop to any genuine sympathy or communion with so ignoble a thing as woman al' "Then my revenge has been just," responded the woman, calmly. '"Your revenge?" observed Walter; with a sneer.   EMMA HOWARD.           23 "Yes," returned Emma, " my revenge. You seem to think it a light, trivial thing, like the woman whose heart you won- whose confidence you filched-whose property you stole like a base thjief, and whose utter ruin you attempted." "Woman," cried Walter, " go not too far, or the farewell you. have to take will be your last." "There was a time," said Emma, with that calm courage which nothing can appal, " there was a time when a threat like 'that coming from you would have terrified-me; but I have seen enough since then to teach me that fear is a folly which departs with one's innocence. It was you that taught me that, and I thank you for the lesson." ".I ail glad you can thank me for any thing," observed Wal- ter, derisively. t' Your menace has no more effect on me than what you can' say or have said before. My love for you was. buried the right I saw you enter the house of Mrs. Lord with a vile strumpet on your arm." "There is no love lost between us, then," said Walter, " there- fore we are quits." -i "Quits," repeated Emma, "yes, -quits, and more so than you think, more so than you dream. 'Twas of this I came to tell you, that your opinion of my sex and me might change and smite you to the soul." "You have taken too much trouble, madam.   I'm afraid you'll find it falling back upon your hands. My soul is not smitten so easily," observed Walter, in a bitter tone. "Perhaps so. When I have done, your tone will alter., I find myself to-day the same in wealth, though not in innocence and feeling, that I was the day I first saw you. Perhaps you will understand me now." "You find yourself the same in wealth to-day," said Walter, repeating her words. "The same," answered Emma. calmly meeting his eye; " the original amount with the interest." A light now began to steal into Walter's mind, and to shed its effulgence in his eyes. "The same amount," he repeated, thoughtfully. , Yes-together with the interest-remember that."   E4 EMMA HOWARD. "'You arc fortunate," he remarked. "You had other property besides what was in the hands of your grandmother, of whom I bliif'iowed the nine hundred dollars?" "No- only the five hundred dollars I took from home with ie,"' replied Emma, calmly. "You do not mean to say, woman," he inquired at length, "-that it was you who----  but, pshaw! why do I ask such an idle question .  You would not dare---- "Why do you pause- F "I was about to compromise my dignity by asking a ridiculous question."                - "Perhaps," said Emma, " it would not be quite so ridiculous a8syou imagine." "I was about to ask," said Walter, "whether you were aware before its occurrence, that the robbery of my room in Fourth Street would be attempted?" ":Yes-I was," was the calm reply. The color fled from W alter's cheeks. He could scarcely credit his senses. His confidence, however, did not desert him; and after -a few moments' pause he resumed his inquiries. "' You, perhaps, know, also of the forged telegraphic notice which hurried my servant, ' Pompee,' to Albany '" ' I do." "Perhaps you know who wrote it, also?" "I do." "Dare you tell me the forger's name "' "I dare." " ame him, then."' "'Twas I Pompee.'" "What! my faithful mulatto r / "Pshaw! were he here, his pale lips would laugh you to scorn. Perhaps, also, you know this 'Pompee ' " "I do." "And where he can be found I As for myself, I have not seen him for some weeks." "Yes."  "Can you tell me?" "I can." "Where, then, is he now?"   EMMA. HOWARD.          2 "You b hold him! he stands before you!" "You-you are ' Pompee!" cried the man of crime, with a look of terror. "Even I," answered the beautiful Emma, calmly. "My God! my God!" exclaimed the wretched man, shading his eyes with his hands; "I comprehend it all now." "Did I not say you would change your tone and opinion of my sex and me ere'I had done?" said the woman, sternly. "You sought my ruin--you deceived me-took me from my home, for the express purpose of getting me among strangers, committing my ruin, and of then keeping me for your mistress; and know- ing me a woman, absurdly imagined that'I would tamely submit to the outrage and the shame, and never dream of rising inImny strength and avenging my injured feelings.' You thought thus, and therefore made no provision, took no precaution to save yourself from the fierce nature you had started, whose undying wrath you had aroused." Walter raised his head, and fixed his eyes upon her with a long, steady gaze-then crossing the room, he seated himself on thie sofa. l You, then, have been my enemy," he exclaimed, in a dry, husky voice. "You robbed me," continued the woman; "' coolly, deliber- ately, premeditatedly, of all my property which was in my grandmother's hands-you won my affection for to honorable purpose. You attempted my ruin--to seduce me from a virtu- ous, honored position, to the low, debased condition of a mis- tress-a private strumpet--a creature of low lust and ignoble passion-a thiling to toy and wanton with in your loose, idle hours. All this you attempted, little heeding, little thinkimg that she whom you thought within. your grasp would summon from their repose the fires and energies which, when set in: moU- tion, would drag you from the summit of your strength and pride, and crush you like a worm, and destroy you like a ser- pent." "On learning," continued Emma, "the falseness of your na- ture and the utter blackness of your heart, I bent every energy to the task of returning wrong for wrong, blow for bl ov, and Shame for shame. I studied your nature and your passions, and f&ond   26         EMMA HOWARD. you strong only on-two points--avarice and pride. To succeed, then, to make you feel in all its horrors the agony of the loss of wealth and pride, there was but one course to pursue-to strip you of every vestige of power, of every inch of property, of every dollar of your wealth. To accomplish this was no easy task, for you were armed with strength and cunning, and all the attributes essential to baffle even men experienced in detecting and crushing rogues. You wanted a servant--one who, Twhile le understood every thing, would never know any thing against the interest of his master. For this situation I in character and disguise applied; and was so far successful. as to blind even your keen eyes. I learned your secrets and yofir instruments one by one, and carefully treasured up the knowledge till the proper time came round, when I would make them tell, and by a series of rapidly successive explosions, bury y6u in their ruins. Pa- tiently did I bide my time till you were within a step of the sum- mit of your wishes in power and wealth. Then, and not till then, did I let slip the hounds of justice to track and hunt you down. 'To secure myself, however, the amount you borrowed of my grandmother, was my first step-the entering wedge of my revenge; and therefore I took possession of the money (about seven thousalnd dollars) deposited at your rooms in Fourth Street. This I thought sufficient to make up the interest with the principal. I put it safely away, and then, to blind youy managed todreceive a telegraphic dispatch from Albany, and. hurried oir to meet you. My game was played well; you never suspected your confidential servant, 'Pompee.' You were near distracted at your loss, but never dreamed that she whom you had robbed long since was the most likely one to have relieved you of your money. My plans have helped you still farther down the hill, by notifying Collan, the gambler, with whom I had long been in correspondence, of the marks you had put /upon your cards; and to make it doubly sure, I, as Pompee,' stood over you during the progress of the game, and by a series of telegraphic signs, enabled him to relieve you of every stake you dared to lay down upon that table. Black with rage, you rose from the table and retired to bed-not to, sleep, but to ponder overhe losses that had pursued you through the week. Soon after you left town, and taking advantage of your absence,   EMMA HOWARD.          27 I paid a visit to the chief of police, in accordance with a prom- ise I had made at an earlier day. The results were the unfold- ing to him of all your business and plans, the ianies of your accomplices, the arrest of your- bogus manufacturer, and the seizure of every article at your house in Eldridge Street." "Ha! curse you," cried Walter, suddenly starting to his feet, with the intention of felling her to the floor. "Back! back to your seat!" exclaimed the woman, as she quickly drew a revolver from her pocket and pointed it at his breast, "or between you and eternity there hangs but one lone second of time!" He gazed, at her a moment, with a vain effort to eye her down, then fell back upon the sofa with a half-stifled groan, which all his efforts could not smother or disguise. Emma now slowly dropped her hand, her finger still on the trigger of the weapon, and continued in the same steady voice as before-- "From the office of the chief. of police I directed my steps to the house of your agent in Leonard Street; he was at home, and I soon enlightened him sufficiently on your business and stand- ing to enable him to bid defiance when you should call on him for your rents. That visit ultimated, as I have since learned, in relieving you of all further anxiety concerning that'prop- ertv." The miserable wretch on the sofa could hardly content himself -his eyes moved from one spot to another in a wild, restless manner. "Thus far," resumed the woman, in a clear, steady voice, "I had succeeded in my purpose beyond my most. sanguine hopes; your schemes were laid bare-your money transferred into other hands-your property gone-your booty seized by the police- your counterfeiting operations blocked-your accomplices arrest- ed:-yourself spotted by the officers of justice-every vestige of your wealth and power swept away, and yourself a beggared, broken, ruined man. You sought my ruin-you did not accom- plish it; in return, I have. accomplished yours." Walter, writhing in his seat, made a movement as though: about to rise and spring, upon her.  In a moment the revolver was raised, and its black tubes -   28s        EBIMA HOWARD. pointing at his head. Again he fell back upon the sofa, and glared at herewith the frenzy of a chained maniac. "You souglit," resumed his tormentor, " the ruin of my cousin, Caroline Wetherbee; I baffled your hellish designs, and saved my cousin friom shame and ruin.; and now, poor wretched worm, farewell. My work is done, for I have destroyed your power; my revenge is accomplished, for I have broken your fortunes and destroyed your pride. I trusted my wealth to you, like a thief you stole it. I gave myself to you, you attempted my ruin. Nothing in your power can ever return me the first; patience and a bold heart have returned me the last. For the one, I have had a sweet, a matchless revenge; for the other, the pleasure of say- ing, I HAVE TRIUMPHED OVER THEE, DASTARD.' With these words she swept from the room, checking a starting movement of the miserable Wretch on the sofa, with the warning, "Back, the head of police and three of his staff await my coming at the door." That day she returned to New York, and took rooms at the American Hotel. The next day she received news that her uncle was very sick. She resumed her disguise, and, as "Pom- pee," visited the mansion in Washington Place. Mr. Wetherbee was pleased to see hAim, as he wished to reward him for saving Caroline, his daughter, from a life of infaimy and shame. 5While in the room, Emma changed her dress, washed the black from her face, and stood before her uncle. On behold- ing his own niece, her who had saved Caroline, he gave a sud- den shriek, sunk in his bed, and breathed no more' . Mrs. Wetherbee and -Caroline, hearing the noise, entered the room. Mrs. Wetherbee, on beholding her husband's lifeless form, and Emma her niece by the bedside, fell lifeless to the floor. Caroline and Emma fainted in each other's embrace. C Friends of youth, they meet again; . Both changed in outward guise; But the love they bore each other then, Still lingers in their, tearful eyes. Those who were wont their hearts to cheer, Have left, their spirits to heaven flown; ' But they will love the stronger still, For the sake of those who are gone."   EMA O:V'-A'tND           29 Emma remained with Caroline that night, and the next day sent to the American Hotel for her things. The Saturday fol- lowing the reverend pastor was'called -upon to read the solemn :service of the dead. Emma and Caroline were equal as mourners, and in the same carriage followed -the aged Christian pilgrims' remains to Greenwood, where now a white marible monument stands over their grave, with this simple inscription: JAMES WETHERBEE AND ELIZA WETHERBEE, MY FATHER -AND MY MOTHER, BORNE TO THE MANSIONS OF ' THE SPfiTIT-LAND,? Yet let me not repilne, twas God's decree, And to his will I'll humbly bend the knee; Strong in faith I'll wait that happy day,. When from this earth to heaven I'll soar-away, And in the realms of everlasting light, Change clouds for sunshine sorrow for delight. CAROLINE. Dear reader, shall I return to Walter, and trace his career- :picture. to you his distress .and sorrow-,the end of his sufferings -or remain with Emma? . ^ Soon after Emma left Walter at Auburn, he came to New York. No friend greeted him ; his money was gone, and no one wished to recognize him. Down, down he hurried in the broad way to the drunkard's cell. That once handsome form, that fine and otherwise noble-looking young man, must bow to the spell, and sink so low.                  i Let three months pass away, and now come with:-iie to: a low hovel in Water Street. We enter-a tall man steps up to each of us, and iii a clear voice addresses us thus: "In the name and' le-lialf of the people of New York, I sum- mon you to sit up6hn the coroner's jury in this room 'at. ten o'clock this -day." On /receiving the above summons we look - around, and on a plank, over which is thrown an old coat, We dis- cover the corpse of who?--Walter. At ten o'cloAk the coroner holds an inquest. The jury bring in a verdict that JX' W. Hunter came to his death in that room by his own handr-,com- mitted suicide. Need I say more-here is the end of Walter; he carried on his villainy to the last. Yes, by taking his own   ' '      1   e   830        EM-MA HOWARD. life, cheated the gallows out of its just due. The next day the last remains of J. W. Hunter were buried in the Potter's Field. Thus ended the career of that base destroyer of human happiness. Now let us return to Emma. Caroline and her brother, after the death of their parents, had requested Emma to make their house her home and remain with them as one of the fam- ily. Emma consented, and accepted the kind offer of Caroline and her brother, and with her presence made their home a 'happy one.                v Some four ,months after, Emma became acquainted with a Mr. James Clark, who appeared to take a deep interest in his new ac- quaintance. He solicited the pleasure of visiting her. Emma encouraged his visits, and ere two months had passed, the beau- ... tiful Emma had engaged her heart and hand to the noble James. The next week' James left the city to be absent a few days in Philadelphia. The third day after he left, Emma received the following letter: PHLADELPHA -------- -DEAR EMMA-I arrived here on Tuesday.   I will stop to write you but a line, to let you know that I am well; for I shall be with you again in one week, and I hope the time is not far distant when we shall ever enjoy each other's society. Please bear my kind requests to your Cousin Caroline, and believe me, Ever truly, yours, On the receipt of the above, Emma wrote the following, which shows for itself what a noble spirit the fair Emma possessed: NEW YORK,      .

Butrt should it be to pine in loneliness, unloved, unappreciated, and unblessed, then it' will not be for naught, but to study to be content with my lot, let'it be cast :as it will; and oh, what a school of philosophy to adapt my impul- sive nature to all the vicissitudes of life cheerfully--and I know I do; for I have had care and trouble that would weigh anl an- gel's wing down to earth, yet have I been cheerful, if not happy. What is to be my future I know not. Sometimes I am exceed- ing weary of life as I have found it. Oh, what a checkered scene has been my life! but you whisper hopes of brighter days. I thank you, dear one, for that; but for hope my spirit would , have fled to God who gave it, long since. But hope has been the beacon tlhat's lighted my darksome way-for I have hoped against hope. What joy have I known, save in doing my duty? Surely none-and still I hope. for peace and joy almost divine. But I have written much more than I had designed, nor can I -scarce now stop. I know not how soon I shall see thee, but I hope ere one week has expired. Please make my unacquainted regards to your mother, and tell her I have a mother, too, who is dear as life to me. Tell her I know her James loves his mother with a truly filial affection; that such wins my admira-  tion and respect.

Cousin Carry andWilliam wish me to convey to you their kind regards, and ask you to make a speedy return. Ever yours, EMMA. - The next week James returned to New York, and one month afterward the New York papers contained the following matri- monial announcement': "Married, on Sunday evening, by the Rev. Mr. Elwood, James Clark, of New York, to Emma Howard, of Alabama." Mr. Clark was the son of a retired merchant, and his qualities of head and heart recommended him to the favorable considera-   ,8$        E1XMMA HOWARD. tion of all who knew him. Immediately after the wedding,. James and -his beautiful bride started for Alabama, but at Charleston the husband was taken ill, and in one short week Emma was a widow. At -Magnolia Cemetery may be seen a tombstone bearing, the following inscription: JAMES CLARK, Died in the twenty-third year of lhis age. None knew him but to lovehim, None named him but to praise. The disconsolate young widow, under the most unfortunate and discouraging circumstances, concluded to repair to her home in Alabama; ; and as there happened to be a gentleman stopping at the hotel who was going to her place of destination, she conclud- ,ed to place herself under his protection. Upon their arrival in a Southern State they were obliged to travel some two hundred nmlles through an unsettled country by stage. One mornihg our heroine and her companion happened to. be the only pas- sengers. --tIt was quite:natural that M'r. Stoddard, for that was the name tof the gentleman alluded to, should have become fascinated by 'Emma's fine appearance and superior manners; and the reader will have no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that she is ^ most extraordinary woman, full of spirit, fire, and resolution, combining in her person all the elements of a great character, and "displaying traits which, in days gone by, would have ren- diered her immortal. A strict sense for justice- a love for all that is right and noble-a determination to avoid the comnission of any act of wrong, these are the distinguishing porift of herf character. We can not sufficiently admire that :qtrength of mind-that firmness of purpose which prompts her to cair out with resolution every design of her heart, no matter'if it:te in direct opposition to the customs of the world, so long as it is right, and perfectly consistent with her own self-respect. Upon the-morning when Emma and Mr.,Stoddard were' the only occupants of the stage, the gentleman becoming excessively amiiorous, so far forgot his position and the obligationis he was tundeir as a protector, to assail the lady with the most infamous   EMMA HOWARD.           .33 proposals, accompanying the offer by splendid and liberal prom- ises. Then, prompted by passion. Mr. Stoddard attempted to take gross. liberties with the person of our heroine, who well knew the inefficiency of the laws to protect a woman when she is assailed by the oppression of the stronger sex. Emma, of course, indignantly rejected these advances, 'and intimated to her persecutor that he must cease his conduct or she would leave the stage. This rebuke, however, produced no effect on Stodi dard, as the sequel will chow. W hen' they arrived at the next stopping-place, Stoddard re- quested the driver to convey them to some obscure and' lonely spot, and at the same time placed a twenty-dollar bill in his hand by way of bribe. The driver was also instructed to remain on his box and to start his horses in case any one appeared. Toward evening, the stage stopped in the midst of an extensive forest. "What means this delay?" inquired Emma, anxiously, as she looked out upon the shadowy trees and the gathering gloom.. Stoddard replied. "It means, beautiful creature, that you have fired my heart with love, and that as Cupid has united us in matrimony, here is the spot where our wedding must be consummated. Come, the hour propitious for the joys of Venus-let us stroll down yonder dark avenue, and talk f love." X "I understand you, sir," said Emma, proudly; "and I scorn your infamous proposals as much as I do your person. Do you think that I will allow you to triumph over my virtue, to rob, me of that jewel which can never be replaced? Away,:sir'! and learn that there are some women who know how to despise the offers of a libertine."  "Your Snger makes you doubly beautiful, and increases my passion," said Stoddard, as he placed himself close to the side of Emma. "Fairest of your sex, I am determined to possess you, for your beauty has distracted me, and the happiness of my. life is involved."  Emma, who was now thoroughly aroused, and who saw the necessity of protecting her honor, replied with her accustomed spirit and courage, "Villain l"place but your hand upon iyt person, and you die!" ',d'   ^34         EM MA. HOWA RD . "ThenI must be content to die," said Stoddard, as he delib. erately placed his arm about the waist of Emma. Quick as lightning the Tonged and insulted woman drew from her bosom a dagger, and as she held it before the -gaze of Stoddard, she exclaimed : "Do not molest me, sir, or this dag- ger shall be your passport to eternity. A female who will not defend her own honor with her life is unworthy of the name of i Womanll.  Stoddard suddenly attempted to gain possession of the weapon, and in the struggle Emrma was thrown to the bottom of the stage, but, by a- desperate effort, she regained her position, and seeing the critical nature of her position, she said: "Touch me aain, - and this weapon shall reach your heart.",  Stoddard, who was now much excited, said: "You are aasmsl- ing the manners of a theatrical heroine, but these airs willlit serve you. You are here, alone, in my power. Submit at. f)" to my wishes, or it will be the worse for you." With these words the false villain attempted to ravish kiss From the rosy lips of our heroine, who, however, nerved up to a. pitch of desperation, plunged the dagger into his heart, and he fell down a lifeless corpse, while Emma escaped into the woods, ind by a series of remarkable adventures, which we have not he space to record, reached her home in Alabama. To avoid unnecessary details, he will state that the driver of the stage was arrested for the murder, and certainly circum- tances were -rather against him. He was tried, convicted, and entenced to be hung on the twenty-seventh-day of the next month. .                     -: About three weeks after these occurrences, as Emma was one morning looking over the columns of the newspaper, she was flnished and shocked to peruse a long account of tlV .trial and conviction of poor Sturges-for that was the name of the stage- driver. She then knew, for the first time, that the man was,-the very next week, condemned to suffer the extreme penalty of the law for a deed which had been committed by her own hand. And how acted Emma   under these peculiar circumstances- under this terrible emergency? Why, she acted in strict accord- ance with her noble nature. She determined to hasten at once the spot, and rescue the man from an unjust death. Her fa-   E MMrA xHOWARD.          35 ther prohibited her from going,: but she hloeded not the prohibi- tion, and prepared at once to carry out her generous design. Upon her- arrival at the town where the execution was to take pliace, she learned that the tragedy was to come off in a very few minutes. Breathlessly did she rush to the place where the gal- lows was erected, and desperately did she push her way through the excited crowd. Upon the scaffold she saw the man who was about to die for her crime. Poor Sturges was resigned to his fate, but his eye brightened when he saw Emma, and then did a ray of hope dawn across his heart, for he was well aware that s/he at least knew him to be innocent. The intrepid woman mounted the scaffold and embraced the prisoner-such was her joy at hot having arrived too'late--and proclaimed herself, as the slayer of' Stoddard. ^ '"'This man is innocent!" said she, in loud and piercing accents; "-I alone am .guilty; let Ime alone be the sufferer. I fear not death-lrelease this man, and sacrifice nme."' "Madam, explain yourself," said the sheriff, who was natu- rally puzzled by these extraordinary proceedings. "That I easily can- do," replied the heroic Emmna; "i sleww Stoddard in defense of muy honor, which I value more than life itself, for what is life without honor?-it is a vanity--7a bibblt: . --a thing of air."  Emma now proceeded to relate, frankly, and without reser:e, all the circumstances connected with the death of Stoddard. Sh'e described the scene in the lonely forest, told of the s truggle and the dagger. "The driver," said she, "is culpable for accepting a bribe and complying with the instructions of Stoddard, but he is not guilty. MJr.' Sheriff, I call upon you, as a responsible officer of the law, to stay the execution."   . . Thus appealed to, and urged by the vociferous shouts of the' multitude, as well as by his own feelings, the sheriff could not refuse. ' He caused Sturges to be -carried back to jail, where. Emma was also temporarily incarcerated, with the understand- ing that on .the next day the whole affair lshould be thoroughly investigated by the assembled citizens at the State-house, at ten o'clock. Accordingly, at the appointed time and place, a vast crowd, )  , 9 P. .   36    -EMMA HOWARD. gathered together to decide upon the merits of the case, and to declare who was guilty of the murder of Stoddard. Emma, when called upon, arose in all the majesty of womanhood, and said, in a loud, clear voice, whichl rang throughout the hall: "Gentlemen,. you have now heard all. Now let me speak, and tell ye all that this deed was done by me! 'Twas I!" A murmur of surprise ran round the crowd of hearers as she spoke. Yes!" she continued, ' with this hand was that man's death caused. And you ask why was the bloody deed committed. It was for what no man of honor can blame me. Nay, rather will applause be heard from every honest lip for the act. He sought by brutal violence to talke from me the greatest treasure I pos- sessed-my innocenlce!--my pririty! Hle sought, like a villain, to rob me of my honor, and 'twas for that act I slew him! Men I fathers! husbands! brothers! that hear me, will ye condemn me -for this? Shall I suffer for what, had youtr wife, sister, or daughter done, ye would have blessed the hand that did the deed, all bloodstained as it-was 2" "No--lo!" yelled the excited crowd; ' you were right!" Emma bowed her acknowledgments, anid the sheriff arose and said: "Gentlemen, what is to be done in this case?  This lady acknowledges herself to be the slayer of Stoddard. Mr. Sturges must therefore be innocent, and in justice he must be discharged from custody.  The people should always rule in a matter-of this kind-what am I to do  *  "Release them both," was the universal cry. "That vote," responded the sheriff, " accords with my own inclinations exactly. Mr. Sturges, you are free, and you will please accept my congratulations on your fortunate escape from an ignominious death. Miss Howard, the public sentiment jus- tifies you in the act which you have committed. You, also, are free." Upon this announcement, .thunders of approbation resounded throighout the hall; and as our heroine and Sturges descended from the platform free, a thousand hands were stretched forth to greet them, and a thousand voices spoke words of sympathy and encouragement. f   EMMA HOWARD.           8S Our heroine requested a man who was near to procure her s liack, and then gave orders to be driven to a hotel. Off they started amid the frantic cheers of the crowd, Emmf in acknowledgment waving her handkerchief from the car riage-window. The cheers redoubled, and in a twinkling the horses were taked out of the carriage, secured to an awning-post, and a hundre( stout arms, before, behind, and at the wheels, propelled the vehicle along toward the hotel, the remainder of the crow( who could not lay hold, shouting like mad as the exciting pro cession moved along. In like -manner was the driver, Sturges, lionized. He was seized and mounted aloft on the shoulders of a num ber of men, and, in an incredible short space of time, the de mand for "' drinks" at the bar of the nearest tavern was perfectly "awful!" Sturges was toasted and toasted again, and as he, of course was expected to "imbibe" in acknowledgment, it was not ver long before he was totally unable, under the circumstances, to d( or say any thing further. In short, he was, on this, to him memorable occasion, most emplatically and decidedly--drunk All that we can say on the occasion is-that he may bless hii stars that he had a free passage in his windpipe through which he was enabled to get drunk; and so we leave him, after seeinJ * that the good-natured landlord had him conveyed to bed, and sav that he was well cared for. Emma,on her return back home, was met by her mother a the door, who had rushed toward it when she heard the sount of wheels, hardly daring to hope for her child's return, buttvit] something in her breast that told her mothers heart it was he: own one, whom she had despaired of ever seeing again in thii world. After a long and tearful embrace, though they were tears ol joy, not sorrow, they turned to enter the room,and the stern face of her father met her gaze. He looked at her for an instant, and recalled in his own mina the threat he had made should she not heed his commands, whei he ordered her not to go where she had just returned from. For a moment there was a struggle-a hard struggle betweel *            v.   38          EMMA HOWARD. his affection for his daughter and his pride and authority as a father. ! She watched the struggle in his face, and then, throwing her- self into his arms, sobbed out:. i Oh! my father, will you not forgive your Emma? you might never, never more have beheld her, and now that she has re- turned safe once more to her father's arms, forgive her disobedi- ence, and all will be well." I he struggle had ended-the love of the parent had conquered, and the strong man laid his head upon her shoulder and wept like a child. "I forgive thee, my child-I forgive thee; and God be thanked that He hath permitted thy return to thy father's heart." Here we must draw the curtain over the happiness of this family, and end our story with the moral, that -Virtue in the end must be triumphant over every thing pertaining to Vice, and in the words of the poet, we think our heroine, Emma Howard, can say: "Vice! though thou dost hold thy sway till weary days be past, Thou'lt bow thy slimy serpent head to Virtue's rule at last.'
