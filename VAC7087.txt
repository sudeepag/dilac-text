C.   INTRODUCTORY. THERE is little need of an Introductory to the contents of this book. This is, however, the most appropriate place in which to say to the reader, that its incidents are founded upon fact. Each occurrence related in this narrative: which is the plain and simple following of the fortunes of several persons during the years from 1860 to 1865: is mainly true. Many will recognize every character in the book. Even the casual reader will perceive, almost at a glance, that many of the privates in the late war were heroes, while some of those wearing epaulettes were poltroons. To the attentive and discerning follower of my narrative will be rendered evident the fact that each picture presented in it is a possible one. For the Author it remains only to say, that each one is true. As to the personal habits and characteristic traits of Our General," the mirror is simply held up to nature. Some men have greatness thrust upon them. From the moment. that the cannon of Charleston belched its fiery vomit upon Fort Sumter, to the surrender of Gen. Lee under the apple tree of Appomattox, the Author of this volume served in the ranks of the army for the preservation of the Union. This story will in the minds of tens of thousands revive memories 19   *20         IN2PODUCTORY. of the late conflict, memories of privation, of forced marches, of hardship of every kind. It will recall incidents of woman's love and tenderness, recollections of actual romance, and sombre and mmestro dirges wailed over the graves of those who bit the dust to magnify and "lift up" into t-le  presidential chair "Our General." In the grave all :I\ equal. What is shown in. this volume is the rounds of the ladder upon which, to the exalted position now held by him, "Our General" climbed. C. LINDEN.   "OUR GENERAL." CHAPTER   I. IN WHCH  SEVERAL OF THE ACTORS WHO TAKE PROMNENT PARTS IN THS DRAMA MAKE THEIR BOW. IN a vale, beautifully situated in the extreme northwestern part of Illinois, our scene opens. On the east, the sun is just appearing over the bluff, and as the glorious flood comes pouring d(own, it makes the dancing waters of the mighty Mississippi resemble a lake of molten gold. In its civilization, the spot is yet young. Not many years ago, the twang of the Indian's bow, as he hunted the deer and the buffalo, was all that bespoke the presence of a human being. Not many summers agone, and the spot of wlhich we write was a favorite tryst- ing-place for the dusky but gentle Indian maiden and her wild untutored lover. In point of beauty, the place las not been improved by the change worked by the presence of the white man. Through the principal, or rather, the only street in the village, let the reader accompany me, and observe for himself. As we enter the village from the eastward, we notice first, that the portion of the ground on each side of the street, which had been laid out for sidewalks, is hidden beneath a most repulsive mixture of slimy mud. Foitunately, the reader will be kept awake, for, at short intervals, the sharp explosive sound of an enormous whip, in the hands of a sturdy specizen of the western frontier-man, breaks the deathly stillness. The whip is cracked at, rather than applied to the horses of an emigrant wagon, lest the jaded beasts should stick fast in the road, into wlich the wheels sank nearly to their hubs. On either side of the street are houses of shapes and sizes as different as they could possibly be. Now we pass a miner's hut, and now a house of pretty respectable 21   AN ILLINOIS VILLAGE. dimensions and appearance. One or two barn-like structures, looking very much out of place, stand near the centre of the village. Some visionary, but wofully disappointed capitalist, had evidently built them under the insane expectation that the place would demand hotel accommodations for hundreds. Near one ofa tese lonely-looking barns stands a small building different from the rest. It appears to 'be neither miner's hut, nor a place of abode for any of the better class. It is a olne-story frame structure with a brick front. Its solitary window is down, and the door is closed. On the wall is a sign, which at one time had set forth that somebody occupied the structure as ll office, for there was yet legible the word " office," but that sign told no tale now. Liike all the rest of the surroundings it bespoke decay. The door, the sash, and the part of shutter that remained to the window, were alike bare of paint. Throughi a broken pane in the window, we can see the faint outline of a solitary figure, but in the dimness of the liglt, caused by the dirt on the glass through which the light struggles, the rest of the room and its contents are very indistinct. To help us in our difficulty, for we want to see and acquaint our- selves with the occupant of that room, yonder comes a man who strides up to and opens the door. After giving him an examination, we will enter with him. The new-comer is a gigantic type of the western trapper species, as we see by his fur cap and Indian dressed skill. In his cheek is, of course, a hlluge quid of tobacco, and the mannler in which he squirts out the juice of it would create a most natural belief that the quid ewas a sponege which filled up again as soo11 as mcttied. The countenance of the trapper bore the proof of heavy drinking, and as he stepped up to the door of the ofice, his gait is just the least bit unsteady. Without the ceremony of I knock- ing he entered. And with him we will go in and inspect the room, and the two worthies who are in it. Thie entrance of the trapper did not appear to disturb the person who sat in a chair, which was slightly tilted backward, and as he sat there, not asleep but with his dull eyes open, it was a mystery how he kept from falling backward. Not by any care or exertion of his own did he preserve his equilibrium, for he was certainly unconsious that he was sitting there. The trapper stood, and not surprisedly, abut rather curiously, surveyed the form in the chair. Having them in their respective positions, we will take a look around. It is evident that for no one business or profession is the office used. On the floor are several rolls of leather, and on the     THE CAPTAIN             23 rolls of leather a strange mixture of tobacco-juice, cigar-ashes, stumps of cigars, and rejected quids. In the centre of the room ig'a table upon which the feet of the stupid-looli ng chap in the chair are ele- vated. On this table is gathered the most indescribable  mess. Spe- cimens of leathler, an inkstand, and some pens, a few unopened letters, empty cigar-boxes, stumps of cigars, and some broken mathematical instruments.  Over the whole mess was the inevitable sprinkling of tobacco-juice which appeared to stain everything in the room. The walls were splattered with it, the floor, when not hidden with leather, or articles of some other kind, was coated over with the forbidding- looking and hleavy-smelling juice. As we approach nearer the uncon- scious figure at the table, we see that his clothing has not escaped thle disgusting rain of the narcotic extract. His shirt-front is filtly with it, and his vest is glazy with it. The huge visitor who had, with a peculiar smile on his countenance, stood scrutinizing the man in the chair, walked up to him, and in a tone that made the little cramped-up room ring, sing out: "Hello, Cap! Stir yourself up a little." Rays of something like intelligence gradually came into the blood-shot eyes of the man, and as he looked up he returned: "How are you, Jim?" and getting up from his seat, he slowly recovered his senses, as lie took a turn or two across the floor. Turn- ing tow'ard the personl addressedl as Jim, he said : "Jim, I'm glad you came in, you are just the fellow, I have been wanting to see." "Why?" returned Jim.   "What's up now?" Cap, as we will--availing ourselves of the trapper's information- call the other, went over to a desk which stood in the room, and lift- ing the lid tlhereof, took-out a little black bottle, and bringing it over to the table, beckoned Jim to be seated.  Jim, after suspiciously eye- ing the few shaky-lookling chairs that were in the place, singled out the firmest-looking one, and bringing it close up to the'table, sat down beside Cap,! and prepared to listen, and to test the contents of the black bottle which he eyed rather affectionately; and as Cap appeared rather dilatory about handling it to his satisfaction, he ulti- mately grasped it in a huge fist that nearly hid all its proportions from view, and raising the bottle to his head, he said: "Here's at you, Cap/, and down went, to judge from the number of gurgles that sounded in his capacious throat, about half a pint of the liquor, after which he placed the bottle on the table and pushed it toward his   24      JIM AND CAPTAIN IN CONVERSATION. companion, who had been eyeing him not so much in surprise, but rather in a calculating way. Jim was evidently wonder-stricken at the manner of Cap, for to see the latter sit quietly by and a bottle within reach, he had not been accustomed. At last, able to contain his surprise no further, he broke out with: "Cap! you're a'hatchin' out suthin', I know you air." A meaning wink was given by him addressed to the speaker, and Cap answered: "Well, yes, Jim, there is a kind of a big nest-egg that I think will stand a little hatching out, and that's what I wanted to see you about." "Trot out the egg," said Jim, laying hold of the bottle again. "Hold on, Jim!" said his companion, taking the bottle from Jim's grasp. "This is an important matter that I wisl to speak about, and I want your attention." "And I want a mouthful of that'ere commissary," said Jim, grab- bing at the bottle again," and d-n the bit of attention you'll get from me until I tickle mny throat with it." Cap saw that he was in good earnest, and relinquishing the coveted bottle, lie shoved his hands and armsl deep down into his pockets, so deep down, indeed, that his pockets lmust have run down to his knees, which position threw his shoulders up until his round head was almost lost sight of between them. Jim took a pretty good "tickle," and said : "Now, then, let drive, old fellow." Jim," said Cap, "what I'm about to tell you, I want you to keep to yourself, fori its a - "Did you ever know me to be a blabber?" said Jim, angrily in- terrupting lhim. "No, no, Jim," said Cap, soothingly. "I. merely wish to impress upon you the necessity of exercising particular care in this matter, it will pay you to do so." At the word pay, Jim's eyes fired with a brighter light, and he quickly responded : "Open your plans." "Of course," said Cap, "you have noticed that those southern fellows are mighty hot over things as they now are, and I believe they mean fight." "So they oughter fight," said Jim, breaking out. "I know that as well as you do," said Cap, "but I believe it to be to my advantage to side in ttle other way; do you understand?" "No; if I do I'll be d----d," said Jim. "One thing I do know,   A LEAD MNE.           25 and that is that you'll take the side as has most plums to pick from." "Well, well," said Cap, coloring rather deeply, "we wont talk about that, Jim; I guess I'll be worth my pay on whichever side I go." "As quartermaster, Cap?" said Jim with a quizzical smile, and eyeing Cap rather sharply. "Well," said Cap, "I'd just as soon be quartermaster "- "And a good deal sooner," broke in Jim. "I reckellect that about the time the tough fightin' commenced down in Mexico, you weren't long a gettin' the quartermastership there." Cap colored still more deeply than before, and seemed rather hurt by the remarks of Jim, who noticed the effect of his speech, and said: "Never mind, Cap, I guess you were all right. But suppose you go on and show me how I'm to make on this affair." "I believe, and with very faiir reason," said Cap, "that I will be given a very faiir osition if there's any trouble springs up; if I do get anything like a fiir one, and I get the chance, I will certainly' look after the interests of my friends." "Yes," said Jim, drily, " that's a good trait o' your'n," and then with a look of disappointment he sail: "Is that the thing that's gone to pay nme so well, and that all this privacy is 'bout?" "No, said Cap; " if you have a little patience I will come to that. I was employed some weeks ago by a gentleman from Georgia, a gentleman named Boulton, whlo lost nearly all his southern property by an unfortunate speculation in cotton ; he got me to run out his lines for him on a lot of ground h'e owns in the neighborhood, and at the same time lie employed me to prospect for lead, which he said he believed the ground contained." "Yes," said Jim, " and you want to hire a miner to"- "No such thing," said Cap ; "can't you wait and hear me out? I set about surveying lhis lot, and while doing so I discovered evidences of the very richest deposits of lead. I do believe that that lot of his has one of the finest mines in it in the county." "What good is that gone to do either me or you?" said Jim. "Why, I will show you how much," said Cap. "I saw the old gent, and marked out three places for the sinking of shafts. He had the three shafts begun where I marked for them. Now, Boulton told me that unfortunately his purse was not very heavy, and that, unless the first sinking was successful, he'd have to give it up and sell the ground. Do you begin to see it?"   26         JIM LEAVES THE OFFICE. No, d----d if I do," said Jim. "What difference will't make to me or you whether he goes ahead or no?" "You are singularly dull to-day, Jim," said Cap; "you don't suppose I went and marked out the very best chances in the lot for the shafts, do you?" "El! Oh yes,I begin tocomeup with you," said Jim, with an attempt at a wi'-; "if the old chap should happen to get disgusted and want to sell-ch?".and Jim made another attempt to wink, which drew up the whole of his right cheek. "I see you begin to ulnderstand," said Cap. "I expect in about two or three days the old fellow will get sick of his mining operations, and when he does I'll need you." "By Jiminy! Cap, you air a wery large improvement on the quartermaster I knew down among the greasers in '4," said Jim, moving again towards the bottle. Cap allowed him, unmolested, to get the bottle, and as he raised it to take another tickle said: "eave  e me elnolh, Jim, to drink success to our move, with you." Jim's juldgment as to awhat constituted enough apDeared to differ with the opinion of Cap, for the latter, when he got hold of the bottle, held it between himself and the light, and, after exatinining the contents, said deprecatingly, "Jm, you must think I only take a toothful at a timle." "No," said Jim, very deci(edly, "I don't think nothin' of the sort, no one knows bettcr'n I do how much you take at a time; anl," said Jim, drawing himself up, "I, as a jinuine friend o' yours thoughlt I'd remove the temptation out o' your road"t saying which he removed from his head a tir cap, lwhich let tfll a mass of matted an( tatgled hair that neither comb, brush, nor scissors had touched for many a month ; and deliberately wipting his mouth with the cap, returned it to 'its plae on his head, and prepared to leave. "I say, Jim, " said Cap, " now don't fail to be here day after to- morrow, it's important." "Got anything about you that might keep a feller in mind of the importance of it?" said Jim, meaningly. Cap hunted through a very greasy pocket book, and producing a greasier twenty dollar note, handed it to Jim, who greedily took it from him, and carefully deposited it in a recess somewhere in the folds of his semi-barbarous costume, and with the assurance that he would keep to the appointment, left.   CHARLES MAURICE MONTGOMERY.        27 As Jim disappeared down the street, a form of very different appearance approached the "office." It was a young man of probably twenty-six years or thereabouts, well formed though slight, delicately molded, but lithe and active. He was of tall stature, with a face that would command attention from even a careless observer. A broad lhigh forehead, white and smooth as marble, a pair of intelligent and kindly blue eyes, and a nose and mouth that gave evidences of resoluteness and energy.  He approached the office, and surveyed the exterior with amaze- ment, and then going up to the door, which had been closed by the owner of the place when it was vacated by Jim, gave a couple of knocks. The person whom we lhave heard addressed as Cap opened the door, and looked inquiringly at the young stranger. "Is tiis the office of Capt. Hiram Sidney?" said the young man, with a tone and expression that betokened that he didn't believe it was. "Yes," said the other; "will you walk in?" '"Could I see Capt. Sidney?" "Yes, I should supIpose so; I am that gentleman."  Captain Sidney could not but note the expression of disappointment in the young stranger's face. "I bear a letter, sir," said the youth, producing the letter, after he had entered, "it is from Col. Hays." "Ah!" said Capt. Sidney, "anything I can do for Col. Hays or for any of his friends I would only-be too glad to do." He opened and read the letter, after which lie stud(ied for a time, as if busy with his thoughts. "Charles Maurice Montgomery," said Capt. Sidney musingly; "the name sounds familiarly to me; " then turning, as if recovering himself, lhe said: "Mr. Montgomery, have you not relations in South Carolina?" "Yes, sir," said Montgomery, "I was born and raised there, and nearly all of my relatives are there." "I thought I had met some of your relatives," said Capt. Sidney. "Anl now tlat I know who you are, I shall take especial pains in your behalf. So you want to perfect yourself in civil engineering do you?" "Yes, sir," said the young man, earnestly; "I am anxious to get all the practice I can." "Well, my young friend, I shall endeavor to do all I can for you, as I said, not only on account of my friend Col. Hays, but on account   28       MONTGOMERY AND THE CAPTAIN. of your relatives in South Carolina, some of whom I know. By the way, what knowledge have you already obtained in your study of civil engineering? Col. Hays mentions that you are a graduate of Princnton." "Yes, sir," said the young man, proudly, "I have probably as thorough a knowledge as I could possibly obtain theoretically, but I lack all practical experience." "Well, we'll soon give you plenty of that," said Capt. Sidney; " in fact I can, if your arrangements here will permit, start you at work almost immediately. Where will you be stopping?" "I cannot say with any definiteness just yet, sir," said Montgomery; "there is here inl the village, a young man named John Prince, who was my college chum ; I promised him tlhat I would call on him when I got here." I know Mr. Prince," said the Captain, "and an estimable and promising young man he is. ndleed the entire family is composed of most worthy lpeople, anld are my particular friends." "Well, I'm glad of. that, sir," said the young man, "for it will make it so much pleasanter. My friend John's advice as to where I had better stop, permanlently, will settle it with me. I am going up1 there now." "If convenient, please drop in upon me to-morrow morning at nine o'clock," said Capt. Sidney. "I will be here at that time, sir," said( younig Montgomery, " if nothing hlapplens to prevent me. Good dlalv, Captain Sidney." "Good day, Mr. Montgomery." And the youth left, bowing gracefully to Capt. Sidney. After walking on up the street labout a quarter of a mile, our young friend asked of' one ofthe villagers, a storekeeper, if lie could direct him to the residence of the Princes. he was directed into a by-lane and told to continue for about four hundred yards down it, and lie would find the place. He walked briskly on, and before many minutes found himself standing in front of a house that he' lfelt must be the home of his friend. It was a large edifice, prettily bulilt, and commodious looking. In front of it was a lovely garden, and behind it an orchard ; on either side of the house was a patch planted with garden vegetables. Everything about the place bore a look of 'neatness and comfort, and it was with real pleasure that our friend stepped- up and knocked at the door. Like an angel's face was that which appeared at the door   THE PRINCES.  in response. A bright-eyed open-faced little girl of about twelve years with the sweetest voice imaginable, said: Will you come in, sir? "Is this the home of Mr. John Prince?" said Mr. Montgomery, fearing he had made a mistake. "Yes, sir, it is," said the little angel, "my namne is Lena Prince." Hallo! Charley, come in; by Jove, old fellow, how are you? Give us your valise; Lena, pet, take the gentleman's hat; Charley, my boy, I'm deuced glad to see you-; when did you get here? how did you find us out?" and almost breathless with his multiplicity of questions and remarks, and with the hearty shake he was giving his friend's hand, John Prince rattled away: "I ow well you are looking; how are all the fellows that I knew at Princeton? But I guess you are starved to death, I'll look after something for, you to appease your appetite with," and off le hurried. He presently returned, bring- ingwith him his mother and two of his sisters. "Charley," said John, " this is my mother, and this is Rose, and this is Carrie, my sisters." The two girls Charley had often heard John speak of, and although he had often believed him a little extravagant in his description of them, he saw now that John did not even do them simple justice. Rose was a medium size, plump young lady of about twenty years, with a full round face, and a fresh, healthy complexion. Carrie was neither so tall nor so stout; a winning little girl of eighteen, with a skin like the lily cheeks, well colored, and a mouth that would tempt a hermit. Mrs. Prince spoke for herself and the girls: "Mr. Montgomery," said she, I am, indeed, very much pleased to see you, and I most heartily welcome you to Rose cottage. Charley has spoken of you and written of you until I almost feel you to be an old friend." Charle could hardly get out his thanks for the welcome and the good opinio, what with his natural modesty and bashfulness and the presence of the two young ladies, neither of which he knew to admire the more. Lena came to his rescue with the announcement that dinner was ready, and on the way to the dining-room John asked Charley where his luggage was, and Charley answered that it was at the hotel. After a hearty dinner, pleasantly partaken of in company with Mrs. Prince and her daughters, Charley arose and was on his way out into the parlor, when he ran across John directing a man to carry his trunks into a room up stairs. Charley was naturally backward, and protested that he could IS}^                . "   THE IVY GREEN     , get plenty accomodations without intruding upon John's family, but John would listen to nothing of the kind, and said that his mother and sisters had looked for him, and had promised themselves thle pleasure of his company at their house during his stay, and that other action on his part would only produce dissapointment and displeasure. Poor Charley, who had not expected anything quite as leasant as this, was overpowered with the kindness, and his grateful heart sent a flood up into his blue eyes that dimmed them; grasping the hand of his friend he presed it, silently, but it said more than volumes could. John proposed a drive through the country, which was gladly ac- cesde to by Charley, and the horse and carriage was gotten ready. When they were fairly started on the road, John commenced to inquire of Charley his prospects. Charley detailed his visit of the morning to Capt. Sidney, and gleefully informed John that he was to lose no time, but would commence operations, probably, on the folldwing morning. Charley thought that John might have exhibitel more el- thusias om than he did, when he had told him about all ofs plans being laid but said nothing- about it. After they had returned home, and had washed and dressed themselves after their ride, John and Charley joined the girls and Mrs. Prince in the parlor. Carrie was playing a very pretty aria on the piano, but when the young men entered she ceased playing. "I hope, Miss Carrie, that you will continue that beautiful piece," said Charley. "No Mr. Montoonry,", said"Roseh"Jn often usedl to speak of your sitging qualities, and we lhad determined that as soon as you had returned we should enjoy hearing, you." Mrs. Prince and C:larrie Joined in the request, and C harley sitting down to the piano acconm- panie4rlimself while le sung, "The Ivy Green;" the singing of which elicitet such complimenLts as, " delighltful," splendid," charmingr from the ladies, and "capital, by Jove," frot John. Of coturse Charley had to sing again and again, and his fine voice rang throulgh the house like a bugle for an hoPlr, by which tinme supper Was announced, and the hlaplpy party adjourned to partake of it. After'supper was over, John and Charley went off for a stroll through the beautifil avenues leading froml the house. John appeared to have some- thing that he hesitated to speak of, and Charley noticed the fact. At last John bluntly asked Charley how he liked Capt. Sidney personally.  SUSPICIONS.           31 "Well, John," said Charley, "I have not been prepossessed by him, but owing to his telling me that your family were particular friends "- "What!" interrupted John, "did he say that?" "Yes," said Charley, " that's what made me so reluctant to tell you what I thought. He has a horribly filthy place there, and between stale tobacco smoke, and a smell made up of whisky fumes and I know not what else, I was hardly able to remain when I first went in." "Look here,- Charley," said John, t"I don't want to say a great deal, but I will merely tell you for your own advantage, keep an eye on Capt. Sidney." "My impulses will lead me to do so, John," returned Charley, "for I do not know that I ever met a man in my life whose general ex- pression created so deep a feeling of distrust in me as did that of Capt. Sidney." "Well, I'm glad of it," said John; "it's the noise of the rattles in the snake that forewarns you, and possibly the sinister expression of Capt. Sidney's face, and his manner in general, may correspond with the rattles of the reptile.  God knows, Charley, I have good reason also to fear that man." "Why, John, you amaze me," said Charley, really excited by the words and manner of his friend. "Yes, and he will amaze you, too, if you don't look sharp; but, my dear fellow, if I can help it he wont," said John, determinedly. "By the way, when do you see him again?" "To-morrow, at nine o'clock," answered Charley. "To-morrow, at nine," re-echoed Jolln," that will give you a chance to go duck shooting with me in the morning; we can get up about five o'clock and be back in time for breakfast, which is at eight o'clock, and after breakfast I will go as far as Capt. Sidney's office with you. And now, come, the girls and mother will expect you to sing some- thing else for them before you go to bed." The two eltered the house, and just as John had said, Charley was called upon to sing something. Charleysung two or three more songs for them, after which he arose to go to his room. As he stood in the parlor door and bowed good night to Mrs. Prince and Carrie and Rose, little Lena advanced to him and said: "Mr. Montgomery, have you a little sister home, like me?" "No, Lena, none so young as you; why do you ask?" "Because," said the little darling," I thought that maybe you used to ,      .   32           "GOOD NIGHT." kiss your little sister good night, and that you'd miss her now, so I was going to let you kiss me good night." g Charley, very much affected by the artless little thing, stooped and tenderly kissed her "good night," and long after he had reached his room and disrobed and stretched his tired body on the comfortable bed in his chamber, the silver ring of little Len4as voice rang through his 'ears, and soothing and grateful was its sound.   CHAPTER   II. IN WIIICH OPINIONS ALREADY  FORMED, AS TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE CIVIL ENGINEER, SURVEYOR, QUONDAh TANNER, ETC., ARE VEPRY  MUCH STRENGTHENED; AND IN WHCH OUR FRIEND CHARLES MEETS A NEW AND PLEASANT ACQUAINTANCE, THAT WILL HEREAFTER   EXERCISE A DEEP INFLUENCE    UPON HS LIFE. FROM a refreshing sleep Charles Montgomery was, in the morning, awakened, by the cheery voice of his friend John Prince, calling to him: "Come, Charley, Iny boy, if you want to try your aim on ducks this morning, you had better be moving out of that bed." Before John had finished his admonition, Clharley had sprung out, and was fast dressing himself. It was but a very short time until the friends were off, fully accoutred, for their sport, and ere long were popping away at the birds with which the little inlet flowing from' the Mississippi was thickly peopled on that early morning in March. Having secured a goodly number of the ducks, the companions retraced their steps homeward. Upon their arrival, they found the preparations for breakfast complete, and all waiting for their presence. The breakfast was despatched with- an earnestness-and zest, on the part of the two gunners, that can be well understood by the reader who has ever taken breakfast under like circumstances; and, after having finished, the two set off' for the walk to Capt. Sidney's office. On the way John said to Charley: "I see Capt. Sidney is superin- tending work on a lot of ground where some shafts are being sunk; I shouldn't wonder if there's where he will start you into your first practice." "I hardly care much," returned Charley, " where the work i so that it will be of such a nature as will furnish me with good practi." "Oh, yes, you will," said John; "for as I passed the place yes tr- day, I saw an old gentleman named Boulton, who is stopping at ti!e 'Barrack '-as we term the hotel where he is staying-and stayinu pretty much by himself too, I guess; for I don't think there is another boarder in it, excepting his daughter. But, as I was going, to,   3 1           MSS BOULTON. tell you, the old gentleman had his daughter with him, and a lovelier girl you never laid eyes on. I had been wondering who she was, having seen her with her \father once before; so I inquired of one of the men at a shaft, and he told me that she was the daughter of Mr. Boulton, who owns'the ground, and that they were going after lead in the lot." ", Yo certainly are very enthusiastic about the girl, John," said Charley, with a smile. "She must, indee, be a very good-looking young lady, for you were never'overly ardent about girls." "Pretty!" said John, earnestly. "By Jupiter, Charley, I'll bet you will say so too when you see her; if she is going to hover about that spot during the work on the shafts, I'll become a student under "Really, John, my phlegmatic fellow, I'm indeed astonished at your unusual warmth; I'm all impatience to see the girl that can set such an uninflammable fellow as you always were in such a glow." "If she doesn't make you feel as if you would like her to become the general superintendent of your operations, when you see her," said John, conclusively, "then I don't know what you are made of." "It seems very much to me as though you were getting pretty well into love with the girl," said Charley. "I guess, however, that were you to become acquainted with her, you'd find her human, and would soon considdr her simply a very nice looking, and probably a very good young lady." "Nice looking," said Joln, emphasizing the word nice; "if you had chosen carefully, you could not have selected a meaner word; why nearly every girl is nice looking "-with another and heavier emphasis on nice--" why, Charlev she is handsome, beautiful, lovely ",- "Tere, John, there; I see. You are gone, sure enough.. That the girl will evidently be a Princess is, in my mind, a reasonable Conviction. I hope I will not be smitten; for I, of course, would stand no chance against you." A shade of seriousness passed over John's face, and he was about to make some reply, when Charley said: "There is that confounded dirty place that Capt. Sidney calls an office, with its horrible filth, and nauseating odor. I do wish it were a little cleaner, if I am to spend much time in it. And:' said Charley, with some degree of resolution in his voice, "it shall be if I stay there much, for I'll fix it up myself." 7i   - THE AUGEAN STABLES.          3 "You wont have to spend a great part of your time in it for the present," said John, " if Sidney puts-you on the ground of old Mr. Boulton. By, the way, Charley, I o erheard one of the men, at the shaft I stood by, say to another m n who was working with him that, under the shaft they were working at, 'there would be about t  enough lead got out to wake a nice plum-bob for old Boulton to put on his mantelpiece,' and then both men laughed. I wonder what they meant?" "I don't know," said Charley; " some of these old miners are very excellent judges of ground. Maybe Capt. Sidney made a mistake in his selection of a place for the shaft." "It struck me as being an odd remark," said John; " but here we arc at this gorgeous place that you are to make such a change in. Don't be too sanguine, Charley, my boy; do you remember the story of the A ugean Stables?' ) "You are very discouraging, John," returned Charley; "but I guess I can play the part of Hercules in this stable. But here we are, when will I see you agiuin?" "At dinner time, if you are back at the house at that time; do you think you will get back for nInner?"  "I can't promise," replied Charley. "I don't know how long this appointment will last. If possible, however, I will get back. Good- bye for a wiile." "Good-bye, Charley, and try and get back, if you can, to dinner. "Good-bye." And John went on down the street, while Charley entered tile office where he found Capt. Sidney, with a half-smoked cigar between his teeth, and a similar specimen on each side of hm on the table over which he was leaning. "Good morning, young man," said Capt. Sidney, looking up as Charley entered. "You are punctual." "Yes, sir," said Charley, "I am very much inclinedto get at work as soon as possible." "Well," said the Captain, "you will not have to wait lon'g now; I want to send you first to see a Mr. Boulton, whom you will find at the hotel on thiis side of the street, and after you get back we will at once proceed to the ground where I wish you to assist me in super- intending the work going om" "Yes, sir," said Charley, quite pleased at having a chance to make the acquaintance of the father of the girl who had so interested-to give it no stronger term-his friend John Prince.   3(           BIMONEY WANTED. "Youl will go to Mr. Boulton, and tell him Capt. Sidney says that we are getting along very well. Just now, however, I want some money. It is a very expensive operation, you know, this sillking of shafts, and I need money very much." "Shall I mention any sum, sir?" "Well, let me see," said Capt. Sidney, falling into one of his cus- tomary reveries, which lasted, in this instance, for fully a minute, during which time Charley was quietly watching his face. "Yes," said the Captain, slowly returng to the consciousness of which he seemed deprived during his dozy consideration of the amount needed, "tell Mr. Boullton that I will need about fifteen hundred dollars, and that probably I will not need any more, or at most, about five hun- dred dollars after this." "Yes, sir," said Charley, resuming his hat, and preparing to leave. "I say," said Capt. Sidney, as Charley was going out; and as Charley turned back, the Captain seemed to have something- to tell himl that lie didn't well know how to-express. D' id you call me, sir?" said Charley.          I "No, that is-eh, I just wanted to say that if Mr. Boulton should demur at the amount asked for, tell him, explain to him how expen-  sive the operations are; and tell him that before long there will be a bigr return from the mines. Do you understand?" There was something so exceedingly suspicious in the manner of Capt. Sidney, that Charley was very Inmuch mystified. Everything tenlded to strengthen tie suspicions he had already formed. With a Yes, sir," that, from its abstractedness, clearly showed that Charley hardly knew that he was saying it, he left the office. Before he had gone many paces, he met the trapper, "Jim," striding towards the offiac. Jim eyed Clharley Montgomery narrowly, as he had seen him leaving Capt. Sidney's office, and the intentness of the man's gaze led Charley to look back after lihe had passed the trapper; and something else had actuated Jim to the very same performance, but, as they saw that they were looking back at each other, each one resumed his walk. Leaving Jim for the present, we will accompany Charley to the hotel, which he reached in a few minutes. Having asked a young man in the place, which seemed like a church after the congregation had departed, if he could be shown to the room of lIr. Boulton, Charley awaited the coming of the colored servant who had been summoned, and after that sable youth badr made his appearance, followed him up stairs to a room, at the door of   AN EMBARRASSING SITUATION.         37 which the servant knocked. In response a voice called out, "Come in," and the servant, with a smile cf satisfaction, pocketing the coin tlhat Charley dropped into his palm, left, and Charley entered. On a sofa in the room sat a gentleman and a young lady. The gentleman was a man of about fifty years of age, with an air of suffer- inag in his face that made him look more than sixtjY. But Charley didn't see much of the gentleman, for his eyes were attracted by the young lady. "No wonder," thought Charley, "that John was so enthusiastic about this girl; this is surely Mr. Boulton's daughter," Addressing. Mr. Boulton, Chlarley saild  "I hope, sir, I am not intruding upon you?" "' No, no," said Mr. Boultonl; " pray, sir, did you wish to see me?" "I came from Capt. Sidney, sir," said Charley; " lihe sent me to say that we are getting along very well, and to- say that he -- " and Charley evidenced his embarrassment by the many efforts he made, each of which failed, to tell Mr. Boulton about the money. At last, thinking that he would get along better if he had Mr. Boultoll out of tile hearing and sighlt of his daughter, Charley said: "'Might I see you privately for a few minutes, Mr. Boulton?" "There is nothing, sir, that I desire to keep fronx my daughter," returned the old gentleman, "'that I would listen to myself--excuse nme, sir, what is your name?" '"Charles Montgomery, sir," replied Charley, coloring deeply. "Mr. Montgomery, this is my daughlter Margaret," said the old gentleman, and he looked at his daughter with an expression of tender- ness and pride. ' You can speakl fieely before my daughter, Alr. AMontgonmery, for, young as she seems, she takes part i'i all my affairs; indeed, iher advice on any matter has with me the greatest weight." Margaret Boulton's face was reflecting the blushes that came and went on Charley's face. She was, indeed, a handsome and a lovely girl. Medium sized, she was neither as plump as Rose Prince, nor as slender as Carrie, but she resembled, in a great degree, both. Her eyes were large and intelligent-looking, and from them came a light that made poor Charley forget where he was. However, as there was nothing left for Charley to do but to' broach his real errand, he set about doing it. "Capt. Sidney said that owing to the expensiveness of the opera- tions on your lot, he would be pleased to have a little money," said Charley, feeling, he couldn't tell why, as if he were begging money for himself.    38       CHARLEY AT MR. BOULTON'S. "Money so soon," said the old gentleman; " why, I was under the impression that he wouldn't need money for some time yet. I gave him some money already.'          ,  "Of that I know nothing, sir," answered Charley. "Capt. Sidney says he will require about fifteen hundred dollars, and that that will pretty well see him through." "Fifteen hundred dollars," said Mr. Boulton, a why, indeed, I ex- pected nothing like this." Then, turning to his daughter, he said, "It is just as I expected, my dear, that scheme would only swallow up what little we have left, and leave us penniless." With a look of great uneasiness he again addressed Charley: "Do you know what prospects there are on that lot, Mr. Montgomery?" "I have not yet been on the ground, sir," replied Charley, " but Capt. Sidney says there will soon be a-large return." "Perhaps there will," said the old gentleman, brightening up. 'A Maggie, I lhave half a notion to follow it up, dear; what do you ; think-of it?"                         !  lMargaret Boulton arose and came over to where Charley stood, and, looking into his ingenuous countenance, said: ' Mr. Montgomery, couldl you form any judgment as to the value of that ground of my father's, as to its worth or worthlessness, after having made an examination?" Charley-he couldn't, for the lifeof him, know why-flushed up as she spoke to him, and still more deeply when he replied: t "Yes, Miss Boulton, I think I could." "Well, papa, hadn't we better wait," said she, "until Mr. Mont- gomery has examined the place?" "Yes, but I have already had Mr. Sidney prospecting it, and it was his 'very encouraging account of the result that made me so san- gulie. t guess Mr. Montgomery, being so young, cannot be any lbetter qualified than Capt. Sidney.", "True, sir,' said Charley; "I have had very little experience; but I should be much pleased to go over the ground, and then call :antl see you." "Well, do so," said Mr. Boulton; you can see me here almost any time during the day or evening." "I shall endeavor to call on you here, sir, in the morning, if that time would suit you." "At what time in the morning, Mr. Montgomery?" "At probably, say, nine o'clock."   RESULT OF THE VISIT.          ,9 "That will suit very well," said the old gentleman, "and we will look for you at that time." Charley bowed to the father and to thue daugter, and left the room. On his way backl to Capt. Sidney's, he was aroused from his though ts about Margaret Boulton oby the reflection that he hadn't gotten either tlhe money or the promise of it. What, then, to report to Capt. Sidney, under the circumstances, he hardly knew. He, of course, roulldn't tell the Captain that Mr. Boulton had determined to await the result of his own examination of the ground. So that, without very well knowing what he was to say, lie found  himself in the office again. Capt. Sidney, with great eagerness in his voice, said, "Was Mr. Boulton at the hotel?" "Yes, sir," said Charley. "'Well, what did lie say about paying?" Charley  wouldn't tell a falsehood about the matter, and was in quite a quandary as to how he had best reply. "He said, sir, that he guessed he'd wait until to-morrow," said Charley, with an attempt at ease, which attempt was not at all suc- cessfill. "What the h-l did he mean by that," said the Captain, rising from lhis seat. "He didn't say what he meant by 'it," said Charley. "Are you sure that you took the proper pains to assure him it was a safe investment?" said Capt. Sidney, eyeing Clharley narrowly. "I told him that you expected there would be a large return," said Charley, glad to be able to tell him the truth. "All right," said Capt. Sidney; "I guess lhe's a little short of money anyhow, and it will take him sometime to get the amount I sent for. Did lie say he'd call on me to-morrow." "No, sir, I said I'd probably call on him again to-morrqw morn- ing."        , "That's right,' said Capt. Sidney, far from surnmising the nature of Charley's appointment. "The only way in which we can get any money out of him is by sticking to him, and' by convincing him of the valuable results of the outlay." Capt. Sidney now busied himself in getting togetiler some surveying instruments, and after a while, turning to Charley, he said: "Mr. Montgomery, I am goinglto do some surveying about a mile and a half from here; I will have all the assistance that I will require, and   40         TIIE WOUNDED MNER. so will not need you. But I would be pleased if you would go with me to the lot of Mr. Boulton, where the men are sinking for lead, and you can there make an examination of the soil as it comes up, and see what the chances are for lead." Charley was delighted that his design, of giving the lot an examina- tion, was going to be of such easy execution, and answered with much gratification: "Yes, sir, I shall be very pleased to inspect the work of the miners." They left the office together, and proceeded as far as Mr. Boulton's ground, on which Charley saw that the work of sinking three shafts was going on. The Captain pursued his own road, and Charley quickly got to work examining carefully the soil that' already lay in the "dump." His most careful scrutiny of the earth failed to reveal the faintest trace of lead deposit. Charley began to consider that either Capt. Sidney was an ignoramus, or else that he had some lesign in directing the shafts sunk where he had ordered them dug. From neither of the shafts could be got the slightest hope that lead would be found. While Charley was busy witl his thoughts he was startled by a cry from one of the shafts. A rope, to which was attached a bucket containing a miner, had broken, and the poor fellow was precipitated to the bottom of the shaft. Charley hastened to lend his aid in getting the suffirer to the surface, when it was found that he had broken an arm and a leg. Charley did all lie could to make the poor fellow comfortable, and leaving him so, hastily ran for the village doctor, who, upon his arrival, set the broken lilmbs and departed again. The wounded miner was very grateful for Charley's kindly assistance, and tried to express his gratitude as best he could in his plain Yorkshire dialect. "I'll niver forget it thee, lad," said he, with tears in his eyes; "thou'st a kind 'art, and I'll .never forget it thee." And in his effort to grasp Charley's and he disturbed the fracture, and groaned. Charley's sympathetic soul really suffered with the poor fellow in his agony, and with his own voice quivering he said: "Never mind, my good man, you will ;oon be all right. Try and lay perfectly quiet for the present, and as soon as possible you will be carried to your hut." "God bless ee, young gentlemnun," said the miner; "He will reward tun for't all." And then, with earnestness, le said: "Is't thee as owns tils property?" No," said Charley, half fearing that the miner would expect the   'Iv      ,    NO TRACES OF LEAD.         41 owner to keep him until he had recovered. "No, it is not mine; it is owned by a gentleman named Boulton." "Whusper, measter," said the miner, "ee may dig and dig, but ee will git no leed." "So I was thinking myself," said Charley, getting interested by the man's earnestness. "What do you think can be the reason of the sinking of shafts and continuing of work where the shafts now are?" "Au cud scarcely tell un wot I thinks of it, measter, but where I wurked last, the man as would keep on the second week, at sheafts like yon, wud be lucked on as daft." "Do you ndt think there is a better part of the ground to try on?" "Ees, an do that, oover yon, on the other corner of the section, joost beyand the middle, there be ceed as sure as I be livin." "What makes you think so?" "Weel, measter, au aftn take a run oover the groun on Sunday; and 'tother Sunday ne and brother Jem wer a cummin oover, and we coom on a place, as we started on by mistake at first, thinkin as it was marked oout for a sheaft, and we begun to look some of the yearth. Says Jem, 'Wully, lad, there be leed here, isn't it woon- dersum that Capt. Seedny didn't keep on here?' Says I, 'Jem, there's soomat in the thing as we don't oonderstand, lad; an th' less we speak of 't th' better.' But there wos leed ther, measter." By this time the companions of the man lad come with the impro- vised stretchers to carry poor "Wully" to his hut; and shortly after they had carried him off, Charley was awakened from his medi- tations as to what the mystery in this thing could be by the voice of Capt. Sidney. "How do you think they are getting along?" said Capt. Sidney. "I have made as thorough an examination as I could," answered Charles; "but I fail to find any traces of lead. Don't you think they are in an unfavorable spot?" The Captain gave Charley a very searching glance, but Charley seemed quite innocent, and the Captain replied; " We have to do the best we can, you know; a couple of weeks more work will prove conclusively enough whether there is, or is not a deposit there." Then, in a careless way, he observed: "They tell me there was a miner hurt." "Yes, sir," said Charley, pityingly, "and pretty badly hurt too; he has broken one of his arms and one of his legs."  42        PROPER SPOT FOR THE SHAFT. "Yes, and he is one of the best miners, if not the best miner in the place," said the Captain, as though he were calculating just how much he would lose by the accident. "He seemned a very intelligent man," said Charley. "You were talking to him then." "Yes, sir; and I did what little I could to make him comfortable." "Did lie say anything about the prospects at the shafts?" Charley reddened and looked confused, which did not escape the eyes of the Captain. "He did express the opinion, incidentally, that there didn't appeal to be any signs of the deposit," said Charley. "Ahen! he said that, did he? What else did lie say about thle matter?" "He didn't say anything else much," returned Charley, " only that in a place over there"-and Charley pointed in the direction--" where they began a shaft mistaking your mark, that he is'under the impres- sion that there is a large deposit." "Tut, tut," said the Captain, looking very much confused under the eye that Charley had fixed upon him, and that he knew was watching his every word and expression-"Tut, tut, lie didin't know what he was talking about. But it's getting late, and I'm going back to the office; are you disposed to go back with me?" "'Yes, sir, they will be looking for me at Princes' to supper pretty soon." "Very good, then," said Capt. Sidney, " we will walk as far as the office together." And as they walked on, the Captain was continually recurring to f what the miner had said, until Charley's suspicions deepened into conviction. Upon his arrival at -Princes', he found them expect- ing him. He explained that he could not return to dinner on account of being busily occupied on Mr. Boulton's ground. Supper done, Clarley asked John out for a stroll, and soon after they had started, Charley imparted his suspicions to John as to the mining operations. "I thought at first," said Charley, 1 that perhaps the Captain had made a mistake in his marking out the placis he (did, but now I am. fully convinced tlmat he designedly set the men to work there know ing the result would be fruitless. I'm anxious to see that place men tioned by the miner; will you go?" "Certainly I will," said John, '" we can easily get back before it is  very dark, and then the girls want you to sing something for some few friends they have invited to our house to-night."   I            IMR. BOULTON TO BE WARNED.        43 They set out for the section of Mr. Boulton, and soon found where work had been conmenced for a shaft. Charley inspected the place and the earth carefully, and turning to John, said, "the old miner was right, John, there is certainly lead here." "Well, from what I hear of poor Mr. Boulton," said John, "he will need it, and very soon.  When I left you this morning, I called on a friend of ours at the other end of the village, and Mr. Boulton, my friend told me, had been to see him the day before about borrowing three thousand dollars. My friend tells me that Boulton hasn't a cent in the world of his own, and that lie is borrowing to operate on lhis section hlere." "I must tell Mr. Boulton, John," said Charley, " or this fellow will ruin him." "Well, you had better be mighty careful of how you go about it, old fellow," said John, as they began to walk homeward. "I'm  to see him to-morrow," returned Charley, "and there is nothing that I can do in honesty, but simply tell him he is being swindled."                         - "I say, you had better exercise a little care in telling him so." "Yes, but what care can I exercise?" said Charley, warmly. "Am I to let him give that knave fifteen hundred dollars more, which he will do, if I don't tell him to-morrow just how lie is circumstanced? '" "On the other side of the question," naid the cooler John, "if you do tell him, why, of course, he will immediately fly down to Sidney and explode his indignation there, which will lead to the Cap's know- ing precisely where he got his information." "I see that," said Charley; "but what else can I do?" "Can you not forewarn old Mr. Boulton, that it won't do for him to show to Capt. Sidney that he knows just how matters stand?" (Yes, John, that is a wise suggestion; and I'll strive and carry it out." Haiving reached the house they found the company awaiting them, and a couple of holrs were most delightfully spent. After Charley had kissed little Lena-which he looked to do as naturally as he looked for a light to accompany him upstairs-Charley turned, and bade the rest of the family good night. In response to his "'good night," John rejoined, "Good night, old fellow, I wish I was going with you to Boulton's to-morrow."    CHAPTER   III. IN WHICH  MR. BOULTON SELLS HS SECTION, BUT NOT TO CAPTAIN SIDNEY. ATrER Charley got to his room, he sat down and indulged in a deep train of thought. In John Prince's remark, as Charley left him, there was a tone of seriousness that Charley could not mistake. It was very plainly evident that John was strongly impressed in Mar- garet Boulton's favor. And then, when Charley Montgomery exam- ined the state of his own mind, he was almost astonished to find the impression the girl had made upon himself. Her image was continually before his mind. No matter what lie might be doing, that face was present, and that sweet smile was haunting him. Charley was a generous fellow, and he determined whatever might be his own preferences, he-would aid, rather than interfere with John Prince in his endeavor to win Margaret Boulton. With a mind strangely filled with a multitude of thoughts-thoughts about his home, his mother and sister, for Charley loved his home dearly, and his mother and his sister devotedly, then wandering off into troubled thoughts as to the condition of affairs concerning his fiture prospects with Capt. Sidney, and above all, the face and voice of Margaret Boulton lingering-Charley fell asleep. When, in the morning hle awoke, his mind was still more filled with thoughts of Margaret Boulton, for his dreams had been filled with the sound of her voice, and that countenance which Charley found himself now all impatient again to see. Arising, and dressing himself, the two friends sat down with the girls and Mrs. Prince to breakfast. Mrs. Prince remarked that neither of the young men was eating heartily, but did not give expression to her observation. After breakfast, Charley proposed that. John should occompany him as far as the hotel, which request appeared to aflord John real pleasure, and the two set out. As they passed Capt. Sidney's office, Charley merely stepped in to say that he was going on according to promise, to call on Mr. Boulton. "   MONEY NEEDED BY THE CAPTAIN.        45 As he opened the door, he found the Captain deeply engaged with the man whose peculiar glance had caused Charley to turn in the road where they had met. "I will give you the money, and you can make the offer," said Capt. Sidney. "But don't you think he'll suspect nothing?" said Jim. "I tell you that"--  Here Charley, to let them know that lie was present, said, "Capt. Sidney." Both the men started, and Capt. Sidney seemed somewhat confused. "How long have you been standing there?" asked Capt. Sidney of Charley, rather testily. "I have just this instant come in, sir," replied Char!ey; "I thought you observed me coming in." "Oh, that's all right," said Capt. Sidney, much relieved; "what is it you were going to say?" "I stopped to say that I am on my way to see Mr. Boulton; you remember I told you yesterday, that I had made an appointment with him for this morning." "Very good," said the Captain; "I hope you will be successful in getting the money, for I need it very much." "Yes, sir," said Charley, going. "I will see him and come back right away, and let you know." And he rejoined his friend, and the two proceeded to the "Bar- rack." Charley proposed that John should sit in the parlor until he returned, which John acceded to, and Charley knowing the room him- self, without troubling any one, ascended the stair, and going to Mr. Boulton's room, knocked at the door. A light step crossed the floor and the door opened, displaying a face and form that made poor Charley's heart throb almost uncomfortably fast. "Good morning, Mr. Montgomery," said Margaret, with a smile that filled Charley with something like sunishine, "I am glad to see you ; will you walk in, please?" "Thank you, Miss Boulton," said Charley, entering; "is your father in?" "He will be here in a few minutes," said Miss Boulton; and refer- ring to a watch that was at her waist, she said, "you are a little early, it wants just ten minutes of the time." "I thought it would make no difference," said Charley, rising to go, hardly sure of whether he was sorry to go, or glad to get away; "I will return at nine precisely."   "         A DISAPPOINTMENT. "Oh, you need not go," said Miss Boulton, with a manner that en- couraged Charley very, very much; " papa may return at any moment now."  Charley resumed his chair, and hardly dared to look Miss Boulton straight in the face; he would have given almost anything to be able to say something. "Were you on my father's lot since, about what we were speaking of yesterday, Mr: Montgomery?" inquired Margaret, with some de- gree of anxiety. "Yes, Miss Boulton," said Charley, "I went over the ground yesterday, and it has made me anxious to see your father imme- diately." "Are there reasonable hopes for good results, from the shafts that are being worked?" "Not the slightest," said Charley, sorrowfully; '"I wish to tell him so now, with all despatch, that he may cease spending money uselessly on them." A shade of deep trouble appeared on the sweet face of Margaret, as she said, in a low, sorrowful tone, "I feared as much, Mr. Mont- gonmery, and I warned my father not to be too enthusiastic about it; but that Capt. Sidney talked so promisingly, and raised his hopes so high, that poor papa thought that all would soon be right again." The tone of subdued suffering, for her father's sake, that was in both face and voice of the girl before him, made Charley Montgomery feel as if he could fight a regiment to. make her heart happier. "I am in hopes that the place is not by any means worthless, Miss Boulton," said Charley; "on the contrary "- "'Excuse me, there is my father's footstep on the stair," and the affectionate girl ran to the door, and out into the hall. The old gentleman kissed his daughter tenderly, and the two entered the room. "Good morning, Mr. Montgomery,-' said Mr. Boulton; " hat are the tidings this morning?" "Not particularly encouraging, sir," replied Charley, solemnly. "I came to tell you that you had better have work on those shafts that are already begun stopped immediately." i "My goodness I you don't mean that they are worthless?" said the old gentleman, with a look of almost agony on his already sorrowful face. "Why, I had secured the money to go on with the work, and was in expectation of having some cheering account from you this morning.'   f j lA GLEAM OP HOPE.                  47 "My account, Mr. Boulton," said Charley, "is partly cheering, and, at the same time, I probably have something to impart that will pain you," and Charley looked in the direction of Margaret. The old gentleman observed his look, and said: "You can proceed, Mr. Mont- gomery, with whatever you have to impart, whether it be pleasant ox painful; my poor darling has been well tested, as a participant, in occurrences of the latter kind during the past few months, and," said the old. man with his eyes moistened, God bless her noble heart, I would have broken down completely, had it not been for her; you can go on, Mr. Montgomery, before her, wit anything you have to com- municate." Charley commenced and gave the father and daughter as thorough a knowledge as he could give them of all concerning' the section. His encouraging account of the nature of the other parts of tie section1 containing probably an abundance of deposit, produced a most happy effect on Mr. Boulton. He grasped Charley by the hand and shook it heartily. "You are a noble fellow," said Mr. Boulton, "you have saved my last chance, of keeping above the surface, from being de- stroyed by a base and unprincipled knave; I will not try to express my gratitude, Mr. Montgomery, for I could not. We will go at once and see Mr. Sidney, and I assure you, I will wind him up very suddenly." "That's the very thing that wont do, sir," said Charley, now feeling as perfectly at home as though he lived with the two before him all his life, and Charley explained the manner in which he had gone to Capt. Sidney, and the position he would be placed in by precipitate action on the part of Mr. Boulton. The latter saw the force of Charley's remarks, and signified his willingness to acquiesce in any arrangement that Charley would make. Charley studied for some time, but-was unable to offer any sugges- tion that would be suitable. Then the confidence reposed in Margaret by her father was shown to be deserved. Margaret proposed that her father should go to Capt. Sidney, and inform him that he would have to sell the section. That some ,one would have to act as purchaser, and that, in this way the whole connection of Capt. Sidney with the work could be severed. "The only obstacle I see in the way," said Margaret, "is that we have no suitable purchaser." Mr. Boulton, Margaret, and Charley, all studied quite a while in their endeavors to think of a proper man to be the nominal buyer of :    48       TIIE LEAD MNES FOR SALE. the property. Suddenly a thought struck Charley. "If you will allow me," said Charley, "I will bring up my friend John Prince, who is waiting for me down stairs. He is a thorough gentleman, sir," said Charley, earnestly, to Mr. Boulton. "I shall be pleased to see him," said Mr. Boulton; "indeed any of your friends are now welcome to my room or rooms, whether I may be in possession of a hut or a mansion." And off started Charley, delighted at the opportunity of introducing his friend John to Mr. Boulton and daughter, particularly to the daughter. Much to John's delight, he received Charley's communication, and with him ascended to Mr. Boulton's room, where, after Charley had introduced him, John agreed to purchase, according to the plans laid down, the property of Mr. Boulton. Kissing Margaret good-bye, Mr. Boulton, assuring her that he would only be absent a short time, left the room in company with John and Charley. It would be difficult to tell which envied the old gentleman that kiss the more. John left them soon after they reached the street, and the other two proceeded to Capt. Sidney's office, where they found Jim, who, evidently, had been imbibing. For some time Capt. Sidney was in a doubt as to what the nature of Mr. Boulton's visit might be, but was soon relieved, and overjoyed, by that gentleman saying: "Capt. Sidney, I have concluded that I will let that lot go, without spending further sums on it. This young gentleman," alluding to Charley, who stood near, " tells me that you would require fifteen hundred dollars. That sum I do not own, and the only thing I can do is to let some one that has more money operate the section." Sidney could scarcely conceal his satisfaction, and Mr. Boulton saw it. Capt. Sidney went on to say that the gentleman present, his friend, Mr. O'Ialler, who had gotten some money together, had just been talking about taking up a section in the neighborhood, and that lie knew of none that would suit better than that of Mr. Boulton's. Of course Mr. O'Haller would be willing to give a fair rate, etc. Mr. O'Haller expressed his readiness to buy, but said, "that d-n him if he'd give more than five thousand dollars for it," "there wasn't no lead in the d--d place, and that was all it was worth," and many other similar remarks. "I would not like to sell for that amount," said Mr. Boulton; " but if that's all I can get for it, of course I'll have to sell at that figure, unless, perlaps, you might find another purchaser that would offer more,"-to Capt. Sidney.                AN' O1FFR yA) BUY.         49 I gues you'll hardly get any higher price than that, Mr. Boulton," said Mr. Sidney with a very persuasive smile. "Why, sir," said Mr. Boulton, "you assured me that one of the finest lead deposits in the neighborhood was in my ground." "We sometimes get mistaken, you know," said the Captain, coolly. "Well, said Mr. Boulton, preparing to depart, "I will be in to- morrow, Capt. Sidney, and if I have no better offer, I will terminate my ownership of the ground in Mr. O'Haller's favor." You'll hardly get any higher offer," said Sidney. "Not a d-n penny," said O'Haller, with one of his unsuccessful winks at the Captain, that both Boulton and Clarley saw. And Mr. Boulton left the office. After Mr. Boulton had gone, the first thing Jim did, was to cut two or three very dexterous, for him, "pigeon wings," in spite of the efforts of Capt. Sidney to stop him. Charley was not blind to this and other occurrences, and the last doubt he had, as to the honesty of the transaction, vanished. "If there is nothing particular for me to do, sir," said Charley, I will go on to the house, and I would prefer staying away this after- noon, if you don't want me here, as I have some letters to write, and other things to do." ' Very good," said Capt. Sidney, "I shall hardly need you, as I am going to finish, this afternoon, the surveying I begun yesterday." Charley betook himself to Prince's, where he found John anxiously awaiting him. "Charley, old fellow," said John, "I can't express to you how happy I feel, at the prospect of frustrating that fraudulent knave. Have you anything else to tell me about it?" Charley told him all that had occurred, and then proposed that, a fter dinner, they should go as far as the hut of the poor fellow that had been hurt at the shaft, to which John readily assented. After dinner the two friends started, and were, in a short time beside the humble couch of the miner. "How do you to-day?" said Charley, kindly. "Aun summat aiser to-day, sur," said Wully, "and I be vury glaid to'see un, indeed I bee," and, indeed, the poor fellow's voice and eyes gave full proof of his assurance. Charley sat down and broached carefully the story of the lead prospecting on Boulton's ground, and soon he saw that the shrewd miner had suspected some- thing wrong. "Me and Jem," said the miner, "aften seed it were woondersum", Soon it was agreed upon, that as soon as Wully had sufficiently recovered, he and his brother Jem should begin anew Y0i          .       60      JOHN PRINCE BUYS THE GROUND. in a proper place, on the section, and having promised to see him more comfortably provided for, Charley left with John. In the afternoon; the two friends had an interview with Ir. Bollton and the arrangements were completed for the purchase by John Prince of Mr. Boulton's ground. The following morning Mr. Boulton, accompanied by Jobn Prince, entered Capt. Sidney's office. Mr. Boulton quietly informed the Captain that the gentleman with him had offered a great dceal more for hs section than had been ofthfered by Mr. O'Haller, and that he had concluded to sell. The Ca)tain in vain tried to assure Mr. Boulton that Mr. O'Haller had set his heart on the property, and would give almost anything like a reasonable figure for it. Mr. Boulton simply said that he had bargained with Mr. Prince about it, and that, by night time, he would cease to own it. Capt. Sidney did not try to coLnceal his angry disappointmdn. While Capt. Sidney was expressing limself in no selected terms, in came O'Haller. Capt. Sidney informed him that Mr. Boulton had concluded to sell to Mr. Prince. O'Haller's anger knew no bounds; the prospect of losing his share of the gain in the transaction made him flrious, and he turnled on John Prince scowlingly, and John's blood boiled under the insults that O'Haller' used to him. Mr. Boulton, fearing that some- thing serious would occur, hastily left the office, taking John Prince-- who seemed very reluctant to leave without settling with O'Haller- with him. The loud and angry voice of O'Haller sounded plainly in their ears, long after they had left the place. Mr. Boulton and John walked up toward the house of the latter, and, on the road, they met Charley Montgomery. "I say, my dear boy," said John, " that will be a nice place for you to go to; Capt. Sidney and that ferocious looking vagabond that he calls Mr. O'Haller are nearly eating each other up for rage, and if you ve ture in, I guess you'll find it pretty disagree- able."  "I shan't mind the John," said Charley, "I guess neither of them suspects me of having had any hand in the transaction. "You are not seriously supposing, Charley," said John, " that they will consider you innocent of the whole affair? Don't believe any such thing." "I hope," said Mr. Boulton, "that nothing unpleasant will result to you, Mr. Montgomery, from your generous conduct toward me in the affair." "Oh" said Charley, carelessly, "I guess I can stand anything that turns up from it; but where are you going now, John?"   A PLEASANT EVENING.          61 "I'm going to bring Mr. Boulton to our house and introduce him to my mother,"  said John, "and then he's going to get his daughter to come and spend the afternoon and evening with the girls." And as John laid particular stress on the "girls," he reddened a little. "Of course we will have the pleasure of Mr. Montgomery's presence also," said Mr. Boulton. Oh yes, sir," said John and Charley both together, and' with a precision of unison that was very indicative of mutual interest in the matter. JohIn went on with Mr. Boulton to the house, and Clarley proceeded to the office. That evening wlas most happily spent by the. party assembled at John Prince's. Margaret Boulton, and Carrie and Rose Prince talked away as though they had been companions for life. The old gentleman and John's mnother had a sober but pleasant chat, when not listening to Charley singing, or to Margaret, who also sung. Jolhn and Charley were both delighted  with themselves and every bolyv else, as they separated, after the evening had been spent, to go to their respective rooms. Little Lena said to Charleyj with whom she had already grown as familiar as with her brother: "Charley, don't you love Miss Boulton? I do." Charley half started, as he was bending to kiss the little pet, and answered, while lie looked anxiously around, to see if any of the others had heard Lena: "Yes, Lena, Miss Maggie is indeed a very fine lady." That night Maggie Boulton occupied the mind of Charley Montgomery long before he fell asleep, and for a long time afterward he dreamed of her.   CHAPTER IV. IN WHCH JOHN AND CHARLEY SET ABOUT GETTING OUT LEAD, AND BEFORE THE END OF WHCH THEY ARE IN A FAIR PROSPECT OF USING SOME OF IT IN A WAY THEY' LITTLE DREAM OF IN THE MNING OPERATION. THE next morning was a beautiful cool, sunshiny morning, such a one as we might rather look for in May than in March. The two companions discussed the next best move to make with their lead mining. "I am pretty much convinced," said Charley, "that Capt. Sidney has suspected me of having had a part in the loss he has sustained, in not getting a hold of Mr. Boulton's section: yesterday afternoon, he made several remarks that convinced me about that." ( You might have been sure of it; Sidney is no fool-knaves never are. A fool, or a knave, separately, is about all a man can be at once." "I was thinking," said Charley, "about bringing Mr. Boulton over to see that miner and his brother, I think they would be capable of doing all the workknecessary under my superintendence.' "Yes; but thaf poor fellow that got hurt will not be able to do anything for a couple of months; his bones are old and brittle, and will take a long time to knit." Well, we can go and see him, anyhow, if you are willing," said Charley. "O , I'm willing enough," said John; let us go and call for Mr. Boulton, and go see the miner this morning." "Very well," said Charley, and after a few preparations they set out for the hotel. They proceeded to the room, and knocked at the room door. The same light step that had made both of them follow with their eyes wherever the sound of it went on the previous night, hastened across the floor, and as the door opened the sweet voice of Maggie Boulton went sinking down deep into both of their hearts. "Good morning, Mr. Montgomery; good morning, Mr. Prince. Come in; papa is here in the next room." 52   A VISIT TO WULLY OVENS.        63 The young men entered, and were greeted with a hearty and cheerful "Good morning, gentlemen," by Mr. Boulton. Charley explained the object of their visit, and said, that if it would be convenient for Mr. Boulton, he would like him to go without loss of time; "For," said Charley, "I am anxious to get back to the office, lest Capt. Sidney should begin to suspect me too strongly of having revealed his designs to you. And I have been absenting i myself so much from the office that, under the circumstances, it may appear to him rather singular." Maggie had her father's hat and cane ready for him before Charley had finished speaking, and kissing her father good-bye, Maggie accompanied the party into the hall, and after bidding the two young men good-morning, returned to her room. The party proceeded to the hut of the miner, where they found him much easier, and profuse in his thanks for the little favors that had been sent him. After a little conversation between them, it was determined upon that the brother of the wounded miner should assume, under Charley's guidance, the superintendence of work on the ground, and that furthermore work should be immediately com- menced. "I forgot to ask your name, my good man, the last time I was here," said Charley. "My nem us Wully, sur," answered the man. "Yes, but what is your other name?" "Ovens, sur, my nem us Wully Ovens; and my brother's nem us Jem Ovens." "Could your brother come over, and see myself and Mr. Prince, this evening?" said Charley. "Aye that he cud," said the grateful fellow,f' and he wud go't on his knees if 'twould sarve you, maester. But I think as 'ow 'eel be 'ere 'fore night time. You know, sur, the work be stopped over to the sleafts on Capt. Seedney's section as we called um, and Jem joost went out a bit ago for some tabaccy. Heel coom   along soon, sur." Assuring the miner that they could wait no longer, Charley was directing him to send his brother over in the evening, when that person made his appearance. "Ther he be now," said Wully. "Jem, these gentlemen wus the wons I was spakin' aboot;" and he told Jem how Mr. Boulton's sec- tion had been worked. Charley then asked the miner if he thought   54          CHARLEY DISMSSED. he could take charge of the men in sinking a shaft, and getting out ore. Jem was of the opinion that he could, and also gave Charley some valuable advice as to how many men, and just which of the men in the neighborhood he should employ. With the understanding that Jem, with fifteen miners of his own choosing, would meet Char- ley on the section at nine o'clock in the morning, the party left. Mr. Boulton and John Prince went back to the hotel, and Charley Mont- gomery went on to Capt. Sidney's office; upon arriving at which he found Capt. Sidney in one of his forgetful moods. The sound of Charley's voice, however, soon brought Capt. Sidney to consciousness, and it was with no very gracious expression that Capt. Sidney looked at Charley as lie stood waiting for the Captain to open the con- versation. Young man," said Capt. Sidney, at last, and Charley felt from the tone that something unpleasant was coming, ' I don't think you are the' kind of a person I want." " am sorry," said Charley, " that you lare disa)pointed in me;" and then approaching Capt; Sidney more closely, Charley aslked: "Is it in anything particular you have found me wanting, sir?" lon't choose to enter into any explanation," said the CaDpiin, crustily. "I am sorry on account of mly friend Col. Hays, that you do not suit me better, but such is the case." In some perplexity Charley stood a moment, and then said, "Shall I write to Col. Hays that you are dissatisfied with me?"  ' You can do as you please, sir, about that; I simply tell you that I don't think you are suitable for this office. As I said befbre, I regret it on account of myn friend, Col. -lays." "And on account of my relations in South Carolina," said Charley, hardly able to repress a smile in spite of the unpleasantness of the situation. Capt. Sidney winced a little, and rejoined : "Yes, and on account of your relatives. I'm inclined to believe that Col. Hays was deceived in you." This time Charley winced, and not wishing to protract such a dis- agreeable sclnle, awhrupltly bade Capt. Sidney ta "Good morning, sir," that nearly stuck in his throat, and left the office with a ptretty accu- rate surmise as to whom Col. Hays as s most deceived in. Charley went direct to Prince's. John had not yet returned, and so Charley waited until dinner-time for him. Charley sat down with Mrs. Prince and the girls to dinner, and still John did not come in.   / ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT.           55 Charley supposed that he had staid to dinner with Mr. Boulton, and most deeply did he envy the good fortune of John, and it was with feelings not unmixed with displeasure, which he strove hard to restrain, that Charley fancied John happily chatting with Margaret Boulton. After dinner he set off fbr the hotel, and there, sure enough, he found Mr. Boulton, his daughter, and John Prince just fis f hing dinner in Mr. Bolilton's room, and all in excellent spirits. Poor Charley felt hardly the same vivacity that the rest were enjoy- ing. He was somewhat consoled by the remark of John, that Miss Boilton had insisted for a long time on sending for him (Charley), but that fearing Mrs. Prince, and Carrie, and Rose would not enjoy such a lonely dinner, she had consented to wait until about the time dinner would be over. "We were just talking this vc minute about send- ing for you," said Magigie Boulton with a snle, to Charley, that he thought recompensed him in a great measure for his absence from the dinner with them. To a question of John's as to how he made out with Capt. Sidney, Charley told them of what had occurred. "It is so much the better," said John. "-You can spend all your time on Mr. Boulton's-I mean on my section," said John with a laugh. "Then I begin to-morrow morning," said Charley, "as Mr. Prince's superintendent-do I?" "Precisely," said John. "Very well, then." said Charley; "and I hope I wilI prove more suitable to him than I did to my last employer." The hours of the afternoon passed rapidly away as the party talkled land laughed, and when they got up to depart, John and Charley found tlhat it was just getting dark. They went home, and had a lowh Conversation that evening, most of which ran on Miss Boulton; and each formed the same magnanimous resolution going to bed, that if the otiler were really serious, he slould have the field to himself. The following morning, John accompanied Charley to the spot where the shaft was to be begun. On the ground were the men whom Jem Ovens had selected, and'Charley soon had them at work. Thle machinery that had been used at the other shafts was brought, and work commenced in good earnest. Day by day for two weeks the men labored away; at the end of which time a splendid vein was reached, to the intense gratification of both Charley and John. One evening the two went over to Mr. Boulton at the hotel, and Charley   56           EXCITING NEWS. was expressing his satisfaction at the result of the work. Mr. Boul- ton was, of course, very much pleased, and assured Charley and John that he felt indeed grateful for their great kindness. "I should advise, said Charley, "the sinking of at least three more shafts in that neighborhood; Mr. Boulton." "What would be the expense of the work?" said Mr. Boulton. "About three thousand dollars, probably," said Charley. "Unfortunately," said Mr. Boulton, "small as the sum  is I. haven't it." "Why, the product of the shaft we are working will pay it easily,^ said Charley. "Oh, then," returned Mr. Boulton, with relief, "you can go ahead with them." At this time, loud talking, which for some minutes, was heard down stairs, grew louder, and the sound of stamping with feet and shouting was heard. "I wonder what's going on," said John Prince; "they are very noisy down stairs. I guess I'll go down and see what it's about;" and out he went. Presently he returned with an unmistakable excite- ment on his face. "The men down stairs say that Sumpter has been fired upon," said John. "H Iow's that?" said Mr. Boulton and Charley, both rising. Maggie, who didn't understand anything about it, besought Mr. Prince to tell her what it was, and John explained, that Fort Sunipter, a United States fortification located in Charleston harbor, had been fired upon by men who were excited about questions that they consid- ered touching upon their liberties. ' Well, what will come of it?" inquired Maggie, with a vague'idea that it wouldn't increase her happiness. "Something very serious will be apt to result; but I hope it is a false rumor," said John. "No," said Mr. Boulton, seriously; "I'm afraid the rumor is correct; I could not but observe the feeling in the South, where I resided until a few months ago; and, although I hoped that our people would not be too hot-headed and hasty, I felt that I was hoping against chance, for all around me I could see the bitterness of feeling deepening. I'm afraid," said he, solemnly, " that it will prove a very serious affair." The noise down stairs grew louder, and out in the street they could also hear voices talking excitedly. As it was getting late, Charley   A MASS MEETING.           57 and John bade Mr. Boulton and his daughter good night, and de- scended o the bar-room, which, usually quiet and empty, was now full of menmen of all sizes, shapes, ages, and appearances; some holding one view, and some holding other views. Charley and John mingled with the crowd, and soon learned that Capt. Sidney had taken advantage of the excitement to call a mass meeting for the fol- lowing evening. After listening to a few colmments on this step of the Captain, the two friends walked home fully determined to go to the mass meeting on the following evening. And if they had not then made up their minds, they would the following day, when at every few paces they took the notice met their gaze: "Grand Mass Meeting, at the Public Square fronting the hotel, to take action con- cerning the firing on Fort Sumpter. Lovers of their country will be out in their might. Patriots, arouse! Capt. Sidney will conduct the meeting, and will also address .the assemblage, as will alI-, other prominent citizens." "We'll go, old fellow," said Charley; "I want to hear Capt. Sidney address that meeting, if I wait for nothing else." That afternoon the quiet streets of the place were filled with anxious looking men. Work throughout the village was stopped, and the farmers from the neighboring parts came in. Wlen the time - arrived for the mass meeting to commence, there were not less than five or six hundred men assembled in the space fronting the hotel. A platform had been constructed, which was draped profusely with flags. On the platform sat Capt. Sidney and other men, who were to address the meeting. A little stout man with a bald head stepped to the front of the platform, and with a voice astonishingly strong for a man of his appearance, said: "Fellow-citizens!" m.4 then went up from the throats of the crowd a tremendous chller probably in re- sponse to the compliment of being called "fellow-citizens" by the stout little gent, who was well known as one of the wealthiest men in the place. After the cheering had subsided, the little gentleman proceeded : "I have the honor of proposing, as chairman of this meeting, Capt. Hiram Sidney, a gentleman and a soldier, knowl probably to most of you." Another cheer, considerably lighter in sound, and with less order in it, now ascended, during which Capt. Sidney advanced, and, when the crowd had ceased cheering, said: "My friends, I have in my hand a telegram, from a friend of milne at Washington, saying that the President will issue a proclamation in a day or two, calling for troops to check the insolence of those '.9   5e68      SPEECH MAKING. people who have already fired on Fort Sumpter." Whether it was for the people that had fired on Sumpter, for the telegram Capt. Sidney had in his hand, or for the proclamation that was to be issued, that the cheer was now given, it would be hard to tell. Probably it was for all of them, as the different shouters felt disposed. "I would suggest, my fellow-citizens," said the Captain, venturing on the "fellow-citizens," as it had proved so successful before, but failed now, " that we should be all ready for the proclamation when it comes. I would suggest that we open a roll for the names of those who are willing to sign now, that they may testify at least that tiley are on the side of their country." No enthusiastic cheering appeared to be coming, until a shout went up from a solitary throat, that in its com- position seemed to be copper. This led the rest off, and Capt. Sid- ney took his seat amid the din. The chap with the voice like a steam whistle was standing right behind our friends Charley and John, and turning, irresistibly to see what kind of a contrivance the man had with whieljto produce such a sound, they saw that it was Jiml O'Ial ler. For an hour now, one followed another in the speech niaking) One said that there were enough sthrdy men in fiont of him "to subdue tlhe entire slave-holding crew." Another said, give him such a lot of' men as were present, and " he'd teach the people that fired on Fort Sumpter such a lesson as they would never forget." The last speaker was a dignified looking man, wlo spoke in a clear voice. -He said that the unlfrtunate occurrence of the day before was one which lle regretted as much as any one could. "I love the 1eople of the South," said (he; " was born 1and raised there; but I love )my country more than I do my people.  I believe that the Union should be preserved unbroken :, and, more than this, believe it is the duty of every one here to lend his aid in keeping it whole. Not in anger, but in sorrow, would I go amiong the people that have mistakenly re- sorted to arms to settle a question that belongs to legislation. Re- luctantly I will go, but I will go, and for the good of the Southern people themselves. If you will permit me to have the honor, sir," he sail, turning to Capt. Sidney, "I will open that roll with my own name." There was the wildest excitement. Cheer upon cheer rent the air, and men clambered up on the platform to get their names down, as if tlhy were securing prizes. Poor fellows! many of them were se- curing their doom. If the last speaker, who wrote in a free bold   JOHN AND CHARLEY ENLISTED.         59 hand at the top of the roll, "Robert Costello," had not spoken,-the probabilities were that few would have signed. It was a peculiar in- cidelnt, too, that of all the speakers, with the exception of Capt. Sidney, Robert Costello was the only one that signed the roll. Among other hearts th the last speaker had fired were those of John and Charley. "It wont last long, anyhow," said John, as they got up on the plat- form to affix their names to the roll; and they both signed their names. The following morning, bright and early, Margaret Boulton made her appearance at Prince's. She wore a troubled look, and when she entered she kissed little Lena, wio had answered her knock, and then asked Lena where her mother otr was. "She is in the dining-room, Miss Maggie," said Lena; ;will you go in to her?" "No, Lena," said Maggie, "I will go into the parlor," and in she went, Lena following her. "I'll tell lmamma that you are here," said Lena. "Don't let any of the others know it, pet," said Maggie. Presently Mrs. Prince came in, and noticing the troubled look upon Maggie's face, asked her if anything was wrong. "O Mrs. Prince," said poor Maggie, "your son and Mr. Mont- gomery have enlisted!" What!" said Mrs. Prince, dropping into a chair; "my John and Charles Montgomery enlisted! No, Miss Boulton, you are surely mistaken."  "My papa told me of it last night, when he returned from the meeting," said Maggie; "and I hoped he was mistaken, but oh, indeed, Mrs. Prince, I'm afraid it's true." Just at that moment John and Charley, having finished breakfast, came out into the lallway, and seeing Miss Boulton in the parlor, en- tered. Noticing the paleness of his mother, and the anxious look of Miss Boulton, John divined the whole cause at once. Charley, too, had his opinions as to what was up, and prepared for a scene. , And it came. As the reader, probably, does not want to be a participant in the unpleasant scene, we will leave the party just where they are. Of t course, John was able to make the thing look very light and simple to his mother. And Charley busied himself doing the same kind, but, to him, pleasanter service for Miss Boulton, not only in the parlor but out into the avenue and all along the walk back to the hotel, at which Charley left Miss Boulton, and returned by himself to the house.   CHAPTER V. "WAR, AND RUMORS OF WAR." "WE'LL be late, wont we, Charley?" said John Prince, hailing Charley, as the latter entered the garden looking very happy. "O no," replied Cllharley; " the meeting was called for ten, and we have fifteen minutes yet." Mrs. Prince, who had been in the doorway, came out, and with the deep concern that troubled her yet showing on her face and in her voice, said: "John, my soln, what other meeting is this you speak of?" i" O it's only a meeting this morning at the hotel, mother," said John, lightly, "of those who signed last night. We are going to organize." A shade of still deeper sorrow crossed the face of Mrs. Prince, as she said: "Well, my son, I suppose there is no -use in my adding further words1 of advice against this step." "Now, mother," said John Prince," don't frighten and worry your- self over nothing," and then with more earnestness, trying to reassure her, John added," indeed, mother, it is only a matter of*form, it will amount to nothing. Come, Charley, we'll surely be too late, and those fellows will be laughing at us, and saying we signed, but that's all we would do." .And bidding Mrs. Prince good-bye the two hastened towards the hotel, where the meeting for organization was to be held. They found probably 150 or 200 men on the spot, among the rest Capt. Sidney, sitting at a table, on which was opened the roll con- taining the names signed the night before. "   "We will go into an election for officers," said Capt. Sidney, rising- "After the nominations are mnade, each man, as his name is called, can vote for his particular candidate." "I nominate for captain, Capt. Hiram Sidney," said a heavy voicer which was easily recognizable as belonging to Jim O'Haller, by those who knew the'man, 60   CHARLEY ETIE  ED CAPTAIN.        61 4 And au numaneat Measter Mungoomery," said another voice, which made Charley start with amazement as he heard it mentioning his own name. It was Jem Ovens that had nominated him. Capt. Sidney and Jim O'Haller both looked in surprise to see what would follow this announcement, and the faces of both brightened as Charley exclaimed, "Indeed you will have to excuse me, I know little or nothing about military matters." "It doon't be any dafference," said Jem Ovens, decidedly; "yud soon leern." "Yes, but, my friend," spoke Capt. Sidney, remonstratingly; "if the young man"- "Neever you mond that," said Jem Ovens, determinedly; " we be goin' to try 'ur anyow." And now several other voices began clam- oring for Chaley's election. It was evident that Jem Ovens had been impress ig his companions, who were in strong numbers in the crowd, with a good opinion of Charley. It ended by the election going on, and Charley being elected Captain. James O'Hallerwas elected first Lieutenant; and the speaker of the preceding night, Robert Costello, was elected second Lieutenant. Charley was very much displeased with his election, however proud he might be of the good-will which secured it. "John," said he to John Prince, "I am very much dissatisfied with the result of this morning's meeting. I hardly know a right wheel from a left wheel, and yet here I am in charge of a company; why I'd only look foolish if we are really wanted." "I know it is a disadvantage, Charley," said John, " but you will soon learn, as that honest fellow said." "If I could only get them quiet enough to listen to me a moment," said Charley, "I would positively refuse to retain the position."  "Yes, and have Sidney step into command of the company," said John, half indignantly. "I don't want to be under his command, and I don't think you do." He wont get it, John," said Charley, with some misgivings of his own on the same score'; " that fine-looking fellow, Costello, will be apt to get it, and then we can help elect him, too, you know." "I doubt it very much," said John. "I feel as if that sneaky-look- ing Captain were already in command; let the thing go just as it is, it will be all right." "No, John," said Charley, resolutely; "I will not, positively, remain in charge of the company. Why, just think, I know nothing at all   62        ANTICIPATED DIFFICULTIES. about the duties of the office. I tell you, I should only make a fool of myself. Bat there is Mr. Boulton in the hallway; let us go out to him." The two friends went out to Mr. Boulton, who shook hands cor- dially with each of them, and invited them up to his room. They gladly accepted, and were soon talking over the all-absorbing topic. "I am sorry that either of you joined that company," said Mr. Boulton. "I saw you both getting excited by the remarks of that Mr. Costello, who appears to be a fine fellow and an honest man. I saw the effect that was being produced upon you by the words that he himself felt. And could I have reached you, I would have endea- vored to counteract the excitement that he raised witlin you. But I could not in time, and when I saw you mounting that platform, to subscribe your names, my heart sank within me." And the old man's voice trembled. "Why, Mr. Boulton," said John, "you are really talking as though- our little company would have to do all the work--even if any will have to be done-by itself." "You know not, either of you," returned the old gentleman, sadly, "where your company will go, nor what it will have to do. I have $  been a quiet observer of the state of affairs in the South for nearly two years now, and every day convinced me more and more that this dread blow would conie." "Yes, but, Mr. Boulton," said Charley, "there is nothing very seri- ous in it yet. We may not have to be absent, if we even go at all, for more than a week or two, or a month at the farthest." "Yes, Charles, that will answer to tell Mrs. Prince, and the girls. Maggie was repeating it to me, just as you used it to her, in trying to convince her it would be at most a pleasant and a harmless excur- sion. If you are really under that belief yourself, free yourself of it in time to avoid bitter disappointment. I am older than you, and have had better opportunities of observing. I tell you, there is no child's play ahead." The two young men, under the sober conversation, began to view the condition of affairs in a more serious light. The three talked for some time, End then the two young men left to go back to the house. That afternoon, according to the agreement in the morning, the company met for drill practice in the space opposite the hotel. Considerably under the influence of liquor, Capt. Sidney and Jim O'Haller are tramping along toward the scene. With a tone much   & A NEW ELECTION.         63 louder than he would use were he sober, Capt. Sidney says: "I tell you, Jim, he seems to have been sent here purposely to annoy and bother me; why just"- "Oh, d-n the young chicken," said O'Haller; "why don't you give him a good trouncing, and scare him off to his mammy. A nice looking captain, indeed, for me to be a lieutenant to." "The young fellow don't want it, Jim," said Capt. Sidney. "I could see, and so could you, that he doesn't want it; it's them miners that pushed him into it." "I'll mash h-ll out of the whole bunch of them!" said the un- steady fellow, with a dash of recklessness, added by the inflaming drink, to his usual ferocity of appearance. "Hush," said Capt. Sidney, here we are in the middle of them and they might hear you; but there's that Montgomery, he's saying something ; let's go hear what's being said." Charley was addressing the company, as the two rode up to where the men were standing. "I am grateful indeed," said Charley, and, indeed, his eyes and voice proved that he was; "very grateful for the evidence given me this morning of your good opinion and good will. But I cannot continue as your captain." Charley went on at length to explain the reasons for his withdrawal, and finished by naming Robert Costello for the position he was vacating himself. Mr. Costello most emphatically refused to accept, and assured Charley that nothing would induce him to submit his name. At this juncture Jim O'Haller spoke. A man to take charge of men, he said, should have expe- rience. His friend, Capt. Sidney had fought in the Mexican war, and had pried himself a'good soldier, and was just the man they wanted to lead them, etc. Suddenly he called out to the men, "All in favor of Capt. Sidney for captain of the company, say aye." And he led off with an "Aye" himself, that in point of volume should be reason- ably considered an overwhelming majority all in itself. Many did not say anything. Others were disposed to object to the action of O'Haller; but under the circumstances, Charley flatly refusing to remain in the office, it was let go, and O'Haller declared Sidney duly elected captain of the company. Capt. Sidney immediately gave orders to the men to form for drill. Were we to follow the move- ments of the "awkward squad," while Capt. Sidney is drilling, or rather attempting to drill them, the reader would get as much out of patience as did the Captain himself. He cursed and swore at the poor fellows for not being more apt, and they in turn lost patience with   "      CHARLEft RE-ELECTED CAPTAIN. the Captain. All hands were heartily pleased when the drill practice was announced at an end for the day. "Be here to-morrow at ten in the morning," said Capt. Sidney to the men, before dismissing them. Many were the remarks made on the Captain that night, by the men of his new company. Some said they would not leave the town under his command. Others said they would have another election; while others again still insisted that Charley Montgomery was yet captain. News came in that afternoon, that the President had called for 75,000 men. This gave an aspect of seriousness to the situation, and when, the following morning, the company reluctantly mustered for a repetition of the disagreeable scenes of the preceding day, Capt. Sidney formally told the company of the call that had been issued, and signified his intention of at- once offering the services of the com- pany to the Governor. "I guess we will leave herte y the day after to-morrow," said Capt. Sidney. Pursuant to his intention, Sidney at once went to Springfield, and offered the services of the company to the Governor. The company was accepted and placed in service, on waiting orders. Next morning, Jim O'Haller received a despatch from Capt. Sidney, which he read before toI company. It set forth that the Governor had accepted the servicesNf the company, and had ordered them to proceed at once to Cairo--near which place there were rumors of a fight-as an independent company. "The Captain," said Lieutenant O'Haller, "is detained at Springfield as mustering officer, and he directs me to take the company to Cairo." Murmur- ings loud and deep now proceeded from the men. Comments upon the courage of the Captain were freely made; and some of the more positive of the men were clamoring for another election for captain. Robert Costello now- appealed to Charley, assuring him that his lack of experience vould do no harm, and that if he accepted the position the mlen would act willingly enougll. Charley could hold out no longer; and when the election for a captain was gone through with, Charley Montgomery had received seven-eighths of'the votes. Good will was at once restored, and under the advice of Costello, who appeared to be a cool, well-informed man, Charley ordered the men to get ready to go to Cairo. "You will have the balance of to-day," said Charley, "and all day to-morrow to get ready in. We will leave at seven o'clock in the morning day after to-morrow." With a cheer for their new captain the men separated for their several homes, with the understanding that on the following night they should assemble in the square, there to camp until the following morning, vlxen they would depart for Cairo.   H:';g              CRYIN'G.            65 Under the direction of Costello, the young man who had been elected orderly sergeant made out a complete record of the voting of the men, and Charley forwarded it that the commissions might be se- cured, with the intelligence that the company would leave for Cairo. At the house of John Prince a gloom overspread the faces of his mother and the girls. Even Lena partook of the general sorrow. "Why do you and John - go away, Charley," said the little girl, standing after tea- by Charley's knee, "when it makes mamma and mly sisters so sorry?" "I will not be away long, Lena," said Charley; " I will soon come back, and John will be with me." "Hlow long will you be away?" asked the little one. "O probably a month, or, maybe, not so long," said Charley. "Mamma cried all day yesterday, and again to-day," said Lena. "I don't want you to be away at all, b)ut I wouldn't cry just because you are going away for such a little while." "Did your manmma cry that way?" said Charley. "Yes, indeed," said Lena, earnestly, " and' Rose cried, and Carrie cried, and-and-and so I cried, too." "Indeed you shouldn't," said Charley, kissing the dear tender little thing; 1" why you will hardly miss us until we are back. But there's John calling me; dearie, good-bye," and Charley kissed little Lena, and went out into the garden, where he found John. "Charley, it's deuced uncomfortable in there, aint it? One would think that there was going to be some of us hung. No one says a word. No one laughs. By Jove, I wish we were off out of here to Cairo;" and John's fine manly face wore a most wobegone ex- pression. "Well, John," said Charley, " you know they are only women, and can't be supposed to take it like men would. But what do you say to going over to Boulton's awhile?" "Well, I'd like to go any where out of here, it's so plagued dull and uncomfortable. Every face looks like an undertaker's at the head of a funeral procession; but I don't want to go away from mother and the girls now, the time is getting so short, so I'll remain. But don't let me keep you, old fellow; go on over and give them my love, and say that I'll all on them for a minute before I go away. By the way, tell them of the addresses to-morrow night, maybe they would like to come over." "I will," said Charley; " when will I say that you will see them?" 5    "      CHARLEY VISITS THE BOULTONS. "Some time to-morrow, I guess," answered John. So Charley set off for Boulton's, and John went in the house. Charley found Mr. Boulton and Maggie in their room at the hotel, and soon got into ,a conversation with the former about his lead mine. "It is valuable, Mr. Boulton," said Charley, "and under skilful managerent that section will secure for you an ample fortune." "Yes, Charles," said Mr. Boulton, "and whatever comes of it, I owe to you. You have done more for me than you can understand." "Don't mention it, I pray you, sir," said Charley, really embar- rassed. "All that I am regretful about is that I now have to go away from you. But, Mr. Boulton, that miner that was hurt at the first shaft will soon be better, and he, I think, will prove very serviceable to you." "I will endeavor to see him," said Mr. Boulton, and then hastily returning to the topic of the departure of the company, said: "You will go from here on the morning of the day after to-morrow, I believe?" "Yes, sir," said Charley, delighted to observe a shade of sorrow crossing Margaret Boulton's lovely face. "We will camp right in front of you to-morrow night, so as to be ready to start early in the next morning." "Your friend, John Prince, will surely come and bid us good- bye," said the old gentleman. "O yes, sir," replied Charley; "he says he will come over to- morrow some time. He also told me to remind you that there will be a kind of a general farewell meeting to-morrow riight." "How do you mean?" asked Mr. Boulton. "Why," returned Charley, "the company will muster, and there will be addresses, and hand-shaking, and"- "I see," said Mr. Boulton; "of course, I will be there." "And I, too," said Maggie. "Very well," said Charley, delighted at the prospect of Margaret Boulton being there; "I shall be glad to see you both there." It was now time for Charley to leave, and bidding the Boultons good night, he went back to the house. John and his mother, with Carrie and Rose and Lena, were in the parlor. John was doing all in his power to raise their spirits a little, but failed Charley thought he never saw a more solemn looking party in his life; le did wh11.t little he could in endeavoring to make things a littil   DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS.         67 brighter, but he, too, was unsuccessful; and when they began to se- parate for the night t was with heavier hearts than had ever before beat under that roof. Poor, little Lena, who hardly knew why, but felt exceedingly unhappy, came slowly over to Charley and, as she looked up to him, said: "Charley, this is the last night you are going to kiss me 'good night,' isn't it?" "Only the last for a little while, pet," said Charley, kissing her fondly. "You mustn't be so unhappy about such a trifle," said he, w "we might be back in two or three weeks, or even before that time." "Yes, but mamma says you might never get back," replied Lena, hallf crying; and Charley, fearing that he, too, would give way if he lidn't get off, left, after bidding the rest good night, saying as he went: "I hope, indeed, that you will look more cheerfully on our little trip to-morrow." But the morrow brought no clange in the feelings of the family. All were miserable, depressed and saddened. On the morning of the 20th of April, 1861, long before the sun had yet peeped over the bluff, the busy forms of the men were moving i  briskly about the ground where they had reposed the night before. i lind hearted, and faithful wives, mothers and sisters, too, had already reached the place, and had brought with them the materials nrd utensils needful for the fiuaewell breakfast of the men. Other :s{ girlish forms were there also, in which were beating hearts that were Sdsddened by the near approach of the separation. Fine light-hearted young fellows were endeavoring to cheer up desponding and sorrowful i sweethearts. "I'll soon be back," were the words whispered into many an ear, that caught the sounds with distrust. Mothers, sisters, wives and sweethearts are there, whom, frolm the bottom of our hearts we may pity, for never again, here below, will they hear those voices, that are now trying to cheer and comfort them. The general hum of voices stilled as an aged minister came slowly along, with his arm drawn through that of Charley Montgomery. The long fine grey hair of the old man fluttered in the morning air, as with infirm steps he advanced toward the assemblage, and his veneraDeness of aspect was increased by his sombre garments. "  Friends," said Charley, "I have brought, at his own request, the Rev. Mr. Miller, whowishes to say a word or two to yotu before you leave. I know that he cannot speak very loudly, and, therefore I hope you will keep as still as you can. Doubtless, lie will say some- ,i@  Ii   ;8    A    A CLERICAL EXHORTATION. thing that will do us good." Charley aided the venerable man u on to the hotel steps, and the men and women slowly gathered ui until they were all as close as they could get. Mr. Miller said t them that it was one of the saddest moments in his life; that he capm to bid farewell to the men, as they started on a mission, the content plation of which made his heart sore. "If 'twere a foreign foe y were to meet," said the Rev. Mr. Miller, "I could bid you Gol speed cheerfully and unhesitatingly, but I shudder at the thoughlt o brother arming against brother. Ye are doing a duty, and a nobl duty, in answering to the call of your country, but your foeman although mistaken, is doing whathe also conceives to be a duty; g among them not in wrath; go, not thirsting for blood, for ' vengeanc is mine,' saith the Lord, but go in sorrow, and with reluctance. An( my friends, pray; pray to that great God of battles for strength, n( only to fight the battles of your country, but that you may I strengthened to fight that battle that concerns you even more, tli battle of salvation. Forget not, I beseech you," said the old mai with earnestness," that you are beset with temptations, and surrounde by trials and dangers, more terrible than the sword or the bulle Avoid strong drink, avoid profanity, treat each other kindly, and Go will, I am sure, be with you and bless you, as I now entreat mou earnestly and affectionately that He will." Tle old man raised h hands, and his lips moved in prayer. Every head was bowed, an when the good old man waved the men a good-bye, the tea were coursing over his furrowed cheeks, while many a moist eC among the men evidenced that the old man had affected thei greatly. It was now getting very near time to depart, and hearts that we already well strained at the thought of separation, now well nigh bur at the Nain of actual parting, a parting that many felt would hlave r reunion. - Mrs. Prince, with Rose and Carrie and Lena, and Magg Boulton with her father, formed a little knot, apart from the body c the men and their weeping relatives, and conversed with Charley ar John, who, poor fellows, appeared to be considerably dejected, ai not much wonder. John's mother and sisters seemed as if their hear were being crushed, notwithstanding the manly efforts the two frienm made to cheer them up. Observing that Mr. Boulton had gone awa Charley left John a moment with his mother and sisters, and we over to Maggie Boulton, who was also very red about the eyes, whic gave Charley a great deal of satisfaction, somehow, and taking Magg   l'          ,A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.      69 bv the hand he said, "Miss Boulton, our time is very nearly up, I wished to bid you good-bye." Charley thought that he noticed Maggie getting a little redder still, around the eyes. "Good-bye, Mr. Montgomery," said Maggie, looking through what Charley saw were, most unmistakably, tears; "I am indeed very sorry that you are going away." Charley got sorrier about it himself, just then, than he had felt before. "I am indeed sorry, myself, very sorry," said Charley, "but I hope we will not be gone a great while." "I sincerely trust not," said Maggie, with an earnestness that made Charley jump. It 'vas also so earnestly said, as to make the young girl somewhat abashed, and she strove to qualify it a little by adding: "poor Mrs. Prince is really distracted. On her account I wisl John were either not going at all, or else that his speedy return would relive his mother and sisters from their terrible anxiety." Charley began to think that, perhaps, he was forgetful of the de- termination that he had made, that John Prince slould have undis- turbed possession of all of Maggie Boulton's sympathies. Fearing that he had forgotten himself in this particular, Charley said, quietly, l to Margaret Boulton, "I am sure Joln Prince would be grateful for your solicitude for his mother and sisters, if he knew that you were so kind. He already respects you deeply, as you can scarcely have failed to notice." The color came and went on her face, but she made no reply. "He is a fine, noble, clever, goodhearted, honorable man," said Charley, very warmly, and almost astonished at his own boldness; "and, Miss Boulton," continued the generous fellow, "I am sure that he entertains the highest regard for you, and-and"- Maggie Boulton's look of amazement caused Charley to bring up a little. "Why, Mr. Montgomery!" said Maggie, in good, real astonish- mnt, "I am sure I can hardly understand you." Charley felt how embarrassing his position was, and determined'to get out the best way he could; so putting a good face on the matter, ie said : "I know you will excuse me, Miss Boulton, I feel the deepest regard for you, alnd would not intentionally utter a word that would wound you, for anything; hut," and he lowered his voice, and-almost pleaded with her, "I wisl to raise poor John's heart a little, when he is   70        CORRESPONDENCE AGREED ON. away from his home, and away from all lie cares for; if we are away from here for any length of time, may John write to you ? I know it would delight him to have this privilege, Miss Boulton, and"- "Mr. Montgomery," said Margaret, "I would most cheerfully give my permission to both yourself and Mr. Prince, hut my father must deter'mine it; here he comes, and I will tell him." Charley, feeling very sheepish and wondering what the mischief ever got him to go on with what he had said, and making up his mind that Mr. Boulton would flatly and indignantly refuse his daughter to correspond with either John Prince or himself, awaited the coming of the old gentleman. "Charles, my dear young friend," said Mr. Boulton, coming up, I have just been up to my room hunting through a trunk for this; take it, to remember me with, and may God send you safe and soon back."  And Mr. Boulton handed Charley a handsome silver mounted Derringer pistol. The company were already beginning to stir, and Charley, after thanking Mr. Boulton fori his kind gift, said: "I will have to hasten over now, the Ilnn are forming," and( he threw a glance at Maggie. "Papa," said Maggie, "Mr. Montgomery thinks that he would like to write to us, and I tell him I will cheerfully, and with pleas- ure, answer letters written either by him or by Mr. Prince, if you will "- and Charley braced himself for the disagreeable rejoinder that he felt was sure to come; but he was soon placed at his ease by Mr. Boulton saying:   Why, certainly, my dear child, nothing will give me more pleasure than to hear letters from them as often as they can conveniently write them."  Taking Charley's hand warmly in his own, he said: "Write us as often as you can, and Maggie shall answer every one of them." Charley gave Mr. Boulton a grasp which gratitude helped to tighten, and then, giving Maggie's hand a squeeze, made up of a contraction of every particular muscle that his full heart had any influence over, Charly left the Boultons, and went round to the Princes', while poor John, whose heart had been so weighted by his mother's grief, that he scarcely knew what he was doing, wont over to the Boultons'. After taking his ftrewell of the Boultons, John rejoined his mother and sisters, getting Maggie Boulton's promise, that she and her father would spend as much more time witl his mother and sisters as they could conveniently spare. Charley bade John's mother, and Carrie, and Rose an affectionate good-bye. With little Lena he was most loth to part, for the dear, innocent little thing   THE DEPARTURE.           71 lad twined lerself around his heart as a tiny vine does around a large tree. But Lena and all he and the rest have to leave; and now the final adieux are given, eyes that can hardly see through tears are fol- lowing the departing men, and the shrieking locomotive whistle is the last sound that is heard by those that remain, as the beloved ones are borne swiftly away. The men were the recipients of a continuous ovation from crowds gathered along the line they passed over, until they got as far south as Decatur. After leaving the place, they had a comparatively quiet ride to Cairo. AR 1'"   CHAPTER VI. OUR GENERAL." A FEW days after the company had left, Mrs. Prince was over- joyed at being handed a letter, anxiously looked for, from John. It was dated at Cairo, and ran thus: DRAR MOTHER AND SISTERS,--We arrived here yesterday about noon So far as Decatur our trip bore a strong resemblance to a triumphal march. The people on our route cheering us in every conceivable way, gathering in and around the depots in the towns and villages through which we passed, running to the doors and windows, on the roofs, in the lawns and gardens; every- where our eyes turned we were greeted by the waving of handkerchiefs, hats, tand hands. While even above the roar and rattle of our train we could occa- sionally hear the stentorian hallo of a dozen or more stalwart young men, who had probably gathered to form an organization with which to follow us. It seems that some of the railway employes had telegraphed the hour we would probably reach Bloomington, and when we arrived there, we found the ladies of that place gathered at the station en masse, in the waiting-room of which theym had spread a table loaded with delicacies sufficient to tempt appetites far less healthy than ours; and notwithstanding the luncheon bask ets you and our fiends were kind enough to furnish us with, we did them ample justice, and amid the heartfelt God-speeds of our fair hosts, we resumed our seats in the train. and again sped southwest, arriving with all the mem. bers of our company safe and well. Charley is doing famously as Captain, and already has the respect of every man in the company, except, perlIps, Mr. O'HTaler, our first lieutenant. By the way, we are to be mustered in as an independent company, and shall need ;a stand of colors; couldn't you ladies manage that for us? My love to Maggie Boulton, and all my friends. Charley writes to Maggie by this mail. Write often, and address your letters for the present to your son and brother, JOHN PRINCE, First Sergeant, Montgomery's Scouts, CAIRO, Illinois. Mrs. Prince read and re-read the letter, and the girls almost studied it. Before the morning had entirely gone Maggie Boulton came in, and she also had a letter, but her missive was from Charley. She told Mrs. Prince and John's sisters that Charley sent the assurance "   MUSTERED IN.           73 that he and John Prince were both very well and quite happy. Carrie Prince read John's letter to Maggie Boulton, and the various com- ments it elicited gradually took the direction of providing the stand of colors mentioned. As the letter does not give the reader a very thorough description of what has been going on since our friends ar- rived at Cairo, the reader had better proceed thither and observe for himself. Not by the medium of locomotives and rails would we ask the reader to go, but by the easier and less fatiguing mode of an imaginary trip. The company, upon their arrival at Cairo, were met by an officer, who introduced himself to Charley Montgomery as Lieut. Ash. He informed Charley that he would muster in the men as an independent company of scouts, according to orders he had received. The mustering in proceeded with, Charley, observing that either Jim O'Haller had been acquainted with Lieut. Ash previously, or else they had taken to each other most remarkably for strangers. When Jem Ovens' turn came, he was asked his age by Lieut. Ash, and, upon his replying "forty-nine," the lieutenant rejected him. Jem was very greatly exercised about it, and declared that others were in the company as old, or older, than he was, as indeed there were. But there was no help for it, and Jem, after a consultation with Charley, prepared to go back home. Charley felt half glad that Jem had been sent home, for he knew that to Mr. Boulton he would doubtless prove very valuable about the lead mines; but above his satisfaction on this score, rose a strong feeling of contempt for such a small nature as that which would perform an act of such a kind, for it was plainly evident that Sidney had given the mustering officer instructions to reject Jem; everything that was connected with the performance, at least, looked very much as though he were at the bottom of it. A manly-looking young fellow approached Charley, and, after some conversation, relative to-the kind of service the company would be likely to see, said: "Well, captain, if your company is going to do scouting duty, and are going to be mounted, I'd a given most anything to get into it, for I like that kind of service, and I like the looks of your company, and I don't want you to suppose I'm trying to soft-sawder, when I tell you that I rather like your own looks." "I guess you can be accomodated," said Charley, really glad of the chance to get the young fellow, for he had a most honest look, and a   74          FRANK BLACKWOOD. very prepossessing manner; "there was a man of my company re- jectel a little while ago, and I should like you to fill the vacancy." The two went to Lieut. Ash, and the young man, whose name was Frank Blackwood, was sworn in. Frank Blackwood knew every man in the company before he was with them twenty-four hours. He had been a travelling salesman for a house in Philadelphia, of which city he was a native. Honest, in- telligent, and with a lightness of heart that nothing could disturb, lie soon became a general favorite in the company. The company were assigned a camping ground in a pleasant place, a short distance north of the town, in which place their tents remained for eight months. Charley and John, although widely separated in point of position, yet maintained the' closest friendship. Letters were both written to and received from Mrs. Prince and her daughters andiMaggie Boul- ton and her fhther, very frequently. Occasionally, to illustrate the progress of affairs, we will give either an extract from a letter, or a letter entire. Sometimes, one of the neighbors would bring Mrs. Prince a letter, received from a husband or son. These afforded Mrs. Prince the greatest satisfaction, anld, very often, pride, for Joln and Charley were invariably well spoken of. The mother of a young miner, who liad left with the company, brought over, one afternoon, the following letter, which she had received from her son. It will show the reader, without any farther trouble, how the company made out in their first scouting expedition. It was evident, from the pen- manship of the youth, that he had been better educated than the average miner; and with little or no trouble, but with great interest, Mrs. Prince read for herself, and to Carrie and Rose and Lena, the letter, which was addressed to Mr. James Scanlon, the young man's father: D:AR PARENTS :-You know I wrote you, giving you an account of our arrival here and muster in as scouts, which made cavalry of us instead of infantry, as we supposed we should be when we left home. Well, we lay in camp until we had become quite at home, and in fact, was getting' the least bit tired of it, when last Wednesday morning Captain Mont- gomery, who is, by-the way, one of the best men in the army, ordered uB to fall in, and upon our obeying, he read us an order from the commanding officer of the post, to hold ourselves ready to march at a moment's notice. Well, such burnishing of sabres, examining of horse accoutrements, inspection of cartridge-boxes, etc., as the boys had, you never saw. However, in an hour or so we were ready, except a few, who were unfortunate enough to be left for camp-guard; and almost immediately after'came our   A SOLDIER'S LETTER.            7  orders to march. When our bugler sounded boots and saddles, we saddled our horses and mounted, and breaking into a column of fours, marched down thlrough the town to the landing, where we disinounted, and leading our horses on board the steamboat awaiting us, we were in a very short time landed on tlhe opposite side of the Mississippi river, at a place called Bird's Point, in M issouri. We then marched in a southwest direction through a level, and in places, swampy country, for about twelve miles, reaching a small town of about three hundred houses, called Charleston, where we obtained forage, and fed our horses. While onr horses were eating, a portioil of the command, about fifteen men, under Lient. O'Haller, were stationed at a cross road, about a third of a mile from our camp, to give notice in case the enemy apDroached our position. We had just sat down to our hard-tack and coffee, after having cared for our horses, when a dozen shots, followed immediately by a yell which every one recognized (although it was the first timie we had heard it) as a charge by the enemiy, and fr a few seconds seemed to paralyze everybody; but the sharp, clear, ringing Voice of Capt. Montgomlery ordering us to fall in dismolunted, soon brought'us into line, and in a moment more we were on the brow of the hill behind which we had been encamped), and were lying close to the ground behind a fence, and within fifty feet of the road, where the enemy would pass on their way to our camp. We had scarcely got fairly settled, before they came in sight, riding slowly along, scanning every point in search of us; but we were so thoroughly con- cealed by the fence, and they. no doubt, expecting to find us muounted, over- looked us : tlheir leader, a fine-looking young man about twenty-five years of age, halted, when opposite me, and looked so intently toward me, that I thought he had certainly discovered us, and I was just on the point of firing at him, when he rode on until he reached a point opposite the right of our line, when our captain's, Grive it to them, boys I " sent volley after volley at them, as fast as we could use our pieces ; several of the boys near me, using tleir revolvers, one in each hand, kept up a continual blaze. 'The leader of the enemy seemed to bear a charmed life, and did his utmost to reform his command and charg, but we had them at a too decided disadvantage; the close proximity of our position making our fire almost murderous, and already half their saddles were empty, and on our giving them another volley, they broke and tell back in confusion. Capt. Montgomery immediately detached twenty-five men under Lieut. Cos- tello, and ordering them to return to the horses and mount, then move forward to a point near tho junction of the lane (in which we had stopped to feed) and the turnpike, halt, and wait there until they should hear the advance sounded from his bugler, and then clharge down the turnpike. T'Ie captain then marched the balance of us at the double-quick down ,the turnpike, about three hundred yards in the direction the enemy had retreated, aid again concealing us behind the fence, waited for the enemy. We had to wait but a minute or two before they came around the curve in the road, and this time at a sharp trot, withl tleir sabres drawn.   76           THE FIRST FIGHT. On arriving opposite us, their leader gave the command, gallop, march, and with a cheer they started at a gallop for the position we had occupied a few minutes before. Captain Montgomery waited until their column covered our entire front, and then gave the order to fire; and partially rising, the boys poured a volley into tlhem wlicli again threw them into confusion; at the same moment the clear lnotes of the bugle sounded the advance, and in a few seconds Lieut. Costello with his party came charging down the road, which had the effect of routing tlhen completely, and this time they did not return. A fact which our cap- tain seeimed to be certain of as soon as Lieut. Costello passed us, as he imme- diately marched us hack to the horses, and sending Sergt. Prince with half a dozen men to patrol the road in the opposite direction from that taken by Lieut. Costello, he set part of us at work carrying the wounded up to a house near us, and the balance to hunting picks and shovels to bury the dead. After having moved all the wounded to the house, and done what we could for them, we went down where the burying party were at work they had dug a trench about six and one half feet wide, and one hundred feet fong, and when we arrived, were engaged in gati theri the bodies and laying them side by side. Lieut. Costello's party had got back, bringing with them the body of poor Charley Morris, he was shot directly through the temple, he was lying by tie side of Ernest Hulsey and Walter Richie, three as good fellows as we had in our company; it did seemn hard they should go in this our first fight, and we be obliged to bury them in al enemy's soil. We laid them next to the end of the grave, and the bodies of our late enemies next, until we had them all in, and then Lieut. Costello read the burial service, and we fired a volley over them, and covered themi with earth. Besides these three, eleven of our fellows are wounded, five, of them so they cannot mount their horses, Nathaniel Collins, Myers Jackson, William Gay, Charles Flint, and Henry 0. Cooper. I heard Capt. Montgomery say that, none of them were dangerous, and they would all get well, the rest are only slight wounds. We then marched back to the house, and finding the Confederate prisoners so badly wounded that they could not be safely moved, our captain decided to leave them to the care of the people residing in the house, who promised to do all for them they could, and borrowing a large spring wagon of them, and partially filling it with hay. we put our wounded comrades into it, and calling in our pickets, started on our march homeward. All this time we had heard notling of Lieut. O'lIaller and his party, and now that the excitement was somewhat worn off; the boys began to wonder what had become of him. We marched on, making the best time we could, with our wagon-load of wounded, and it being by this time dark and the roads bad, it took us until eleven o'clock to get back to Bird's Point, where, on account of there being no boat, we were obliged to camp until morning; there being fortunately two regi- ments camped there, we secured the services of a surgeon for our wounded, and the commissary issued one day's rations to us, which placed us in very comfortable circumstances. Some of the boys in one of the regiments, the   SIDNEY MADE COLONEL.           " "th Illinois, told us that Lieut. O'FIaller got back about two o'clock, and that his men told them that we were all captured. Directly after daylight, hav- ing hoisted a signal, the boat came over for us, and embarking, we were soon s nugm in our own camp, with the boys who had been left in camp, and O'Hal- ler's men crowding around us, and begging to know all about it; of course, we satisfied them, and they in their turn told us that infernal scamp, O'Haller, had reported at head-quarters, that after sending him out on picket, our cap. tailn iad left us feeding our horses, and gone to the house to get his dinner, and the rebels had captured him, and then us. Of course, captain soon fixed all that, and is now busy writing to the friends of the poor boys who were killed. Yours ever,       JANMKS SCANLON. Mrs. Prince shuddered as she read of the daiger in which John had been; and his sisters were fairly blanched with terror during the reading of some parts of the letter. John's next letter to his mother mentioned tie fight, but made very light of thh danger; lie spoke warmly of Charley's bravery and courage. Charley Montgomery, too, wrote to Carrie Prince a letter, in which he gave a brief account of the "little engagement," as he termed it, and in which he said John had proven himself a brave soldier. Sincere and earnest were the prayers for the safety of the two friends that ascended from the hearts of the mother and sisters of Johnl Prince. Our friend, Capt. Sidney, we have to some degree lost sight of. Supposing tlhat the trouble between the United States and the people of the South would be settled almost immediately, and that it would not be by any shock of arms in the vicinity of Springfield, at that place he determined to remain, and at that place he did remain, one of the bravest and most intrepid mustering officers that ever swore a man into or cursed him out of the service. However, at Springfield there were few or no chances for an enterprising man, of an ambitious dis- position, so as "a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind," Capt. Sidney reeled into the office of his gubernatorial friend, of whom he made some mention to James O'Haller early in our story, and after a conversation, the greater part of which no third person could under- stand, nor probably either of themselves, it was decided that Capt. Sidney should preface his name thereafter with "Col." His appoint- ment was given him, and he was placed in charge of the 21st Illinois Infantry, which was at Caseyville, to which place he proceeded, and shortly afterwards moved to Mexico, county seat of Audrain County, Mo., and thence to Pilot Knob. During the greater part of this time, he had been continually in such a condition of mind as to warrant the supposition that le was unwell. The sympathies of a kind-hearted   78           "OUR GENERAL." Congressman--who afterwards managed Sidney, as a concealed show- man pulls the strings that jump a puppet-being enlisted in his favor, Sidney was, as a pretty fair start, commissioned Brigadier-General, and ordered to command the post at Cairo. Towards the latter part of' August, 1861, the peculiar form of Capt. Sidney made its appearance at Cairo. His tout ensemble was, for an officer in a civilized army, rather striking. He had on, to begin with, for it was the nmost conspicuous article of dress that lie wore, a very badly soiled, rough, unshapely high silk hat. The shortness of his neck was a sufficient excuse for the absence of a collar to what we will, under protest, denominate his shirt. His coat and pants were nap- less, greasy black; and his boots would not bring thirty-seven cents in any second-hand shop in the country. Of course, he was not very impressive looking in this rig. The first man he sought, when lie arrived at Cairo, was the immaculate Jim O'Haller. Sidney inti- mated to Jim that there should be some little enthusiasm among the men on account of his taking the command, and he even generously suggested to Jim a plan by which the men might be stirred up a little. The plan was a very good one, Jim thought, as there was a good deal of whisky in it. Sidney ordered the commissary to issue a barrel of whisky to each regiment, and Jim O'Ialler was to look after the rest of the plan. "OUR GENERAL " was the shout that was to go up from thousands of throats that evening. Wild cries of "Our General "were to awaken the night, and the glorious scene that Sidney and Jim had projected would well repay the eff'rts they had made in getting it up. Alas! for human calculations. The liquor was absorbed with a promptness and faithfulness that neither Sidney nor O'Haller could find fault with; but when it came time for the air to be rent, for the wild enthusiasm to be displayed, there ient up, as Sidney rode out-that was the signal agreed upon between Sidney and Jim O'Haller-such a straggling, miserable series of half-drunken shouts of, "Our General," that, w h the most intense disgust, the great man turned his horse's headl nd went the other way. But the thing leaked out, and "Our Gcnet .A19 became among the boys of the pom- mand the synonym of contel .pt. Sidney and Jim O'Hallcr that night had a long cousultatioi, at the headquarters of the former, and they both vented their indigna- nation on persons and things in general, but upon Capt. Charley Montgomery in particular. The profanity which both indulged in we will not repeat. -j   PLLOTrING.            79 "Cuss his bones," said Jim. "He's altogether in the way, and I do b'lieve that if he stays in this command he'll be a gittin pro- moted to you scarcely know where," said Jim, looking significantly at "Our General."  From the scowl that crossed the mild and( gentle face of that officer, one might suppose that he was delighted at the idea of Charley's fine prospect. 1  - "If 'twas me," said Jim, continuing, "I'd send that young coon where he'd be apt to stay." Sidney looked at Jim O'Haller steadfastly for a few moments, and then said: "11 'll have some work for him to do to-morrow." The following day Charley Montgomery was ordered to pick six men and proceed on a scout to Kentucky. With an ill-concealed smile of satisfaction, Jim O'Haller saw Charley and his men start. But it was with a worse concealed stare of astonishment that lie saw him coming into camp again on the following day with not a mama of those that he considered doomed missing. As Charley and h1f men came in, it did not lessen Jim's disappointment in the least to observe the genuine welcome they received from the men in camp. That afternoon, when Jim went into the tent of the General, the latter told him that Captain Montgomery had really brought back information that was most valuable, and had gone about his business in a way that was truly admirable. Sidney and O'Haller conversed long on the subject, and, ultimately,. O'Haller said that "if 'twas him" he would send Charley into Missouri, the danger was greater there; and as one scouting party wasn't enough, that he'd send another out; only he'd send them in different ways, and unknown to each other. "I've got nary a doubt," said Jim, that if any of 'em would bring back information from that trip it would be interestin' if it wouldn't be valuable." Sidney was always a man of few words, and did not say much then; but that lie thought Jim O'Haller's suggestions worth attending to will show from the happenings hereafter. We will now go over to Capt. Charley's camp, and learn what is being done over there. A voice rattles out: "I say, fellows, you have got your coffee and hard-tack all safe, now; and here's your pipe all filled ready for you, John Bradley. Now we want an account of what Cap and you fellows done on the scout." "That suits us; forward is the word, John," shouted half a hundred voices.   80         A SCOUTING EXPEDITION. "All right, boys," said the individual addressed as John Bradley, good humoredly. "You see when we, that is the six fellows who went with Cap, got orders to get ready for a scout, we knew, from the quiet way it was given, that it was going to be something unusual, and getting our traps ready, we went down to the landing, where we were to meet Cap. Going aboard the boat, we were soon over on Ken- tucky soil, where Cap told us what was up. It seems there had been some movements at Columbus, which would seem to indicate an intention on the part of the Johnnies to occupy Paducah, and old Stove- pipe wanted to know just what they were doing, so he had sent Cap and us to find out. "Well, we swung ourselves into our saddles, and away eastward we went, with nothing to bother us until we had gone about twenty miles, when we met a negro, who told us that a party of about 200 of the enemy had passed, going, east about nine that morning. We marched on, rather more carefully after this, for about five miles, when coming to a retired-looking cross-road, we struck down that; I sup- pose we had gone probably two miles, when we came to a cozy little farm or plantation, as they call it down here, and Cap said if we could find feed for our horses we would stay there all night. "Finding plenty of forage, we put our horses in the stable, and ac- cepted the invitation of an old lady, who turned out to be the proprie- tress, to go in and eat supper; and you can be sure, boys, that, after our experience on hard-tack, etc., so long in camp, we could and did do full justice to the bountifully-spread table. Just think of it, boys,- sitting in chairs, like Christians once more, before a table nicely spread witl clean linen, and covered witl a good, well-cooked supper! "Well, of course, we did all we could, and it coming to an end, as all good things will, the young ladies, of whom there were three, pro- posed an adjournment to the parlor, and we had some music. ) "In, tie corse of half an hour, some half dozen more youn} ladies belonging in the neighborhood dropped in, and, for twoo three hours, everything went merry as a marriage bell, until o e of the negroes, belonging to the place, came to the door, and, I l'oning to Cap, stepped back into the hall. Cap went out into the hall, and in a moment came and said, 'Boys, we shall have to ride: a little farther to-night;' and, notwithstanding we hated it, we were obliged to bid the ladies good-bye, and follow Cap out into the yard, when lie told us that he had some good'news, and would tell us more after we were started. Hastily saddling our horses, we started back the way we   A RECONNOISSAXCE.           81 had come, and then Cap told us that the negro had informed him that \ about two miles from us there was a Confederate officer, stopping for the night, andt Cap said he thought this officer had despatches from Bowling Green for the commanding officer in Columbus, which would be valuable to us. "Well, we marched back until we reached the point on the main road where we had left it earlier in the evening, and turning east, we rode about a quarter of a mile, when we came in sight of a house, which the negro said was the one. Dismounting, we left our horses in the timber, and, separating, we approached the house in different directions. Cap came up on the front, and the officer was sitting on the front porch. Seeing Cap, he ran back through the hall plump into my arms, at the back door. "Well, we examined him, and found just the papers Cap was after, and, getting his horse, we brought him along back with us; and as the papers are very important, I should not wonder if Cap was promoted for procuring them, in which case we shall lose him." "O, I hope not; I hope not!" re-echoed from all sides, as John, rolling himself in his blanket, prelarcd to go to sleep. After laying in camp for several days, until its routinebegan to be monotonous, Charley was rather pleased than otherwise, to receive an order to take his command and make a rcconnoissance in Missouri. Going aboard one*of the boats at Caigo, they were in a few hours landed on the west bank of the Mississippi, about thirty miles above Cairo, and immediately took up their line of march for a small vil- lage, lying about eighteen miles southwest of the point at which they larnded. After marching about ten miles without seeing anything to indicate the proximity of the enemy, Charley ordered a halt, and gave the command an hour to feed their horses and eat their dinners. Re- sumin;g the march, he reached his destination about nightfall; and, after examining the vicinity, he ordered them into camp inside the walls of a partially constructed building, which had been intended for a monastery, but, the war commencing ;about the time the walls were finished, work had been stopped on it. It, however, did very well as an impromptu fort, being proof against any attack except artillery ; and, being suffi ;i.:tly large to. accommodate the entire command, including the horses, enabled Char- ley to render his company safe by using only a very light picket guard. 6                      *   82           A FALSE ALARM. After getting the nmen for outpost duty stationed, and their supl finished, the 1men, one by one, fell asleep, and by ten o'clock noth disturbed the still night but an occasional stamp of one of the hor or the heavy breathing of the tired sleepers. At about eleven o'clock, they were startled by an alarm from *home vidette, one of the outposts being attacked. In a moment every man was on his feet and stationed at eithe window or door ready to receive the assault. Charley cautioned tlI to be careful and not fire on their own men, and just as they \w beginning to fear that the post had been captured, the quick, sh tramp of several horses at full speed, followed by a ringing lan that every one recognized as that of Sargt. Scanlon, announced tl approach. , Being halted by Sargt. Prince, they gave the countersign, and i moment were inside Fort'"Iontgomery, as the boys had dubbed half finished building. Sargt. Scanlon told Charley that his post I been approached by about two hundred horsemen, and as they refl to halt, nor gave any answer to his challenge, he fired into them i then fell back. After waiting about half an hour, the heavy tramp of a large colu of cavalry announced their approach, and upon the lhead of the colu coming into view about two hundred yards from our fort, they w ordered to halt by our sentinel, which they at once obeyed, and uj his demanding who they were, answered "Friends ;" he then gi the order to advance one, and give the countersign, when one of tli who seemed to be an officer, riding a short distance toward us, rcpli "that he did not know wliat our countersign was, but that his na was Hawkins, and his command were out on a scout from C Girardeau." Clarley recognizing the name, and having once seen Capt. HH kins at Cairo, answered him by-giving his name, and proposing t Capt. Hawkins should ride forward so that he could satisfy himseli to Capt. Hawkins' identity. Capt. Hawkins seemed to be a little suspicious, and proposed t Charley slould meet him half way, which Charley, amid the rein( strances of his men, proceeded to do. Lieut. O'Haller remarked that he would get the command ce tured by his d--n fooling, notwithstanding which, Charley wall toward the horseman until he was about one hundred yards from  building, when the stranger rode up to him, and Charley at 0]   MSMA NAGEMENT.           83 recognized him. Capt. Hawkins ordered his men into camp, and came back to the fort with Charley. "It seems that addled-brained general of ourp has telegraphed to Cape Girardeau, ordering Capt. Hawkins out on a scout in the same lirection he had sent us, and without telling him of the probability of his meeting any other federal force, thereby endangering many valuable lives in each command," said Charley, in response to a question of John Prince. The management, or rather mismanagement, on the part of Gen. Sidney, secured for "Our General" a hearty cursing for his careless- ness, from the boys, before they laid down and went to sleep. r Next morning, Charley and Capt. Hawkins, comparing notes, decided there was no enemy in force in that vicinity, and separating, started for their respective camps, the Montgomery Scouts arriving at Cairo about eleven o'clock that evening, thoroughly tired out and disgusted with the wretched management of"Our General." E                        '.   CHAPTER VII. \ BELMONT. JUST after recall from drill had sounded one morning, Charley received a copy of the following order:- hIEADQUARTERS, DISTRICT OF SOUTHEAST, MSSOURI, CAIRO, Nov. 5th, 1861. GRNERAL ORDER No. 9. Commanding officers of Regiments, Batteries, and detachments, receiving this order, will hold their commands in readiness, to march at an hour's notice. Commanding officers will, by the assistance of tlhir surgeons, see that all the sick and tfinthearted are placed on the sick list, and left in camp. By order of                  HRAMt SIDNEY, Biig.-Gcn. Commanding. Charley proceeded at once to obey the first part of the order, having no occasion for the latter part, and about 3 o'clock p. m.,-received orders to report with his command on the levee at once; arriving at which point, lie narched aboard one of the transports, which imme- diately dropped down the river for a mile or two, and came to anchor, evidently waiting for the other transports then loading at the levee. This continued until near 9 P. M., the difierent transports as they received their respective loads following the examp)le of Charley's boat, and dropping down, came to anchor alongside of him, the last boat being the flag boat bearing "Our General," the captain of which at once hoisting signals, the rest weighed their anchors; and followed him; but we will let the following letter, written lby John Prince, tell the history of their trip: CAIRO, Nov. 8th, 1861. DEAR MOTHTER AND SISTERS :--   have scarcely recovered from the complete exhaustion of yesterday, but fearing that you might learn indirectly of our late fight, I thought it best to give you an account of it; before doing which, let me say, we are nearly all well, no one being hurt so seriously as to put them off duty. On the evening of November 6th, 1861, "Our General" (as the boys 81   "ETTER FROM JOHN PRINCE.         85 all call him) at the head of two brigades, commanded respectively by himself and Gen. McC--d, left Cairo for Belmont. On the opposite Kentucky shore, the Confederates, under Gen. Polk, had fortified a position at Columbus, which was to colmand the camp at Belmont, as well as to blockade the Mississippi river. Dropping down to within a few miles of Columbus, the transports and their attendant guards, the gun-Doats, anchored for the night; and the colmmanding officers of regiments, etc., and the naval officers, tthllered on the headquarter-boat of "O ur General," to receive, I p1resume, their final instructions. These instructions would seecn to have been voluminous, as their delivery occupied "Our General," and his aids until the grey dawn an- nounced the near approach of the momentous morning of the 7th, when they separated for the boats containing their respective com- mands. 'Their flushed countenances and dizzy gaits, especially that of "Our General," as he appeared on the deck to bid some of the naval oflicers God speed, added to his thick, almost- unintelligible utterance, proved conclusively how powerfully his feelings were af- fected by the a)pproaching battle, and to what extent each and all had strained their mental faculties in arranging the details for its sue- On the following morning, the boats dropped down to a point near tile first bend in the river above Columbus, and the troops debarked on the Missouri side, just out of range of the guns at Columbus. After getting his lines formed," Our General," taking personal com- nland of the reserve, ordered an advance, which was at once com- menced.          : Fortunately, in landing, the boats had dropped down to a point in- side of the picket line of the command at Belmont, which enabled us to approach to the immediate vicinity of their camp, without creating any alarm. On their camp guard observing us, they at once fired upon us, giving the alarm, and formed a line to check us, but there being only about seventy-five men on duty, and the balance of the encampment being entirely surprised, the brave fellows could, of course, only fall back, and the -balance of tlheir force, on account of the surprise, not having time to form, could afford them no assistance, and the charge of our well-formned line, of tlree thousand, at once cleared tie camp. This being observed on the shore opposite, they immediately opened their heavy artillery on us, when there ensued a scene of disorder andl   86      {"OUR GENERAL S"FIRST BArTLE. confusioneual to anything in that line gotten up by the same num- ber of r e "the creation. Order hl^shing to the right of the line, then to the left, then to the central officers everything; one regiment deployed in this direction, another in that, forming fronts toward. every conceivable point, except toward the enemy. Two fine regiments, being drawn up within fifty yards and facing each other, with their pieces at a ready, seemed determined to kill or capture anything that should at- tempt to run the gauntlet between them. All this time the cornmand- ing officer of the Confederates, on the opposite side of the river, had been busy loading two transports with infantry, and crossing them to a point about a mile below us, where Gen. Cheatham was busy reor- ganizing his command, and on their reaching him, Gen. Cheatham at once commenced an advance in our direction. About this time, a shell from one of the pieces at Columbus, in passing through the tree-tops over our heads, cut off a decayed limb, which, in filling, struck the war steed of "Our General," causing the horse to shy suddenly, and "Our General," being somewhat dizzy, on account of the immense mental efforts he had put forth during the past night, lost his seat in the saddle, and found one a foot deep in Missouri mud. Of course his staff rushed to the rescue, and one of them dragging him from the mire, cried to the crowd around, "Fall back and give him air, fall back," which was at once transferred tc others farther away, and thence to the different regiments as ain order from "Our General to " fall back." Then ensued a scene which beggars description; the different regi- iments being faced in every oonceivabIt direction, of course, in obeying the order, "fell back" in every conceivable direction, and one rush- ing against the other, in their efforts to obey the order, threw the en- tire command into the, most inextricable disorder. This deepened by tlhe action of the shells from Columbus, the gunners there having by this time got the range, and the skirmish line of Gen. Cheathan; having approached near enough to commence using their rifles, re- sulted in (notwithstanding the heroic efforts of Gen. McC- d) setting the whole mass en route for the boats, on the double quick. The officers in charge of "Our General " noting this, and seeing themselves being rapidly deserted, and the ominous stars and barn rapidly approaching, two of "Our General's" most powerful aids, seizing each an arm, hurried him after the fleeing mass; a work of no small difficulty, "Our General" being a man of tolerably solid physical structure. Fortunately, however, on reaching the confines of   THE RESULT.            87 the camp, they were so anxious to vacate, they discovered a mule, and, cutting his halter, they hurriedly placed "Our General" astride of him, and sans saddle or blanket (although the mule had evidently seen rough service, his backbone being painflilly prominent), two of them seizing his halter hurried the animal, bearing "Our General," after the flying column; whllile two others exerted themselves at his rear with rods hastily cut from the underbrush. These energetic. measures soon brought them to the point on the bank of the river where the headquarter boat lay; and our long- earedt friend having by this time been annoyed by the two annoyances at his rear to a point beyond forbearance, suddenly elevated his hleels, causing "Our General" to describe a series of circles in the air, landing him in a sitting. posture on the edge of the bank, down which he gracefully slid deaving a plainly lithographed trail in the slimy bank of the Father of Waters), until lie reached the boat, aboard of which he was energetically dragged by a colored roustabout; Iwheu the captain of the boat immlediately ordered the lines cut, and the boat dropped back toward the middle of the stream, followed by the curses of the brave fellows whom the wretched management of "Our General " hald prevented fom even showing fight, and who were now left by him to their fate. By this time, the force under Gen. Cheatham had advanced until they were in close proximity to our force on the bank. Our officers, notwithstanding the hard labor undergone the previous night in pre- paring plans for every possible contingency, seemed to have forgotten thils particular one, and, in consequence, did not know what to do. The brave Gen. McC--  d had succeeded in getting a few men to- gether, whom he had improvised into a rear guard, and was attempting, with some success, to stay the advance of Gen. Cheatham, when, un- fortunately, the pickets of Gen. Cheatlam, inside whose lines we had been all the morning, concentrated' their force and made a charge on ef  Cour flank, which had the effect of again starting the whole force up the bank of the river. The naval officers in chage of the gunboats having by this time obtained an understanding of how matters stood, allowed the trans- ports to pass them, and opening their portholes shelled the woods in the rear of our force witl such efibct as to stop the advance of Gern. Cheatham; and t!?en, ordering the transports to land on the west bank, from time to time succeeded in picking up during the day tile most of our command, wlen we steamed for Cairo; and so ended the first battle under "Our General." Your son and brother,     JOHN PRINCE.  i   88        WINTE    TER QUART ERS ERECTED. After the return from Belmont, Charley, having had there an op- portunity to discover the defects in the organization and drill of his company, set himself at work earnestly to remove them, and by dint of drilling three hours per diem and organizing evening lessons, giving each sergeant charge of a class, he soon produced a very de- cided improvement in his command. On returning from Belmont, they had been ordered into camp on Bird's Point, instead of Cairo, and, about the 20th, they received orders to commence the erection of barracks or winter quarters. About half a mile south of where they were encamped stood a cypress forest, and having procured a set of tools from the quarter- master's department, they set to work felling the trees and transport- ing them to the site of their encampment. After procuring in this manner a sufficient quantity of timber to put a building of the requisite dimensions, Charley, having in the mean- time drawn up plans for its construction, selected a number of me- chanics, whom he found in his employ, and placing the balance of the men under their control, set them to hewing and fitting the timber; and in a few days the sides of a very respectable looking structure, of sufficient capacity to accommodate Charley's entire command, was completed. Then detailing one party to select timber to be split into shingles, and another party to procure rafters, they soon had their building covered, when they gladly deserted their, by this time, well-worn tents. They moved into their new quarters, finding themselves decidedly more comfortably situated. A few days after the boys were established in their new quarters, Charley received an order fromn General Sidney to prepare his com- mand for a review, which would take place on Bird's Point the fol- lowing day, and, in obedience to the order, the troops-on the post, consisting of seven regiments of infantry, one of cavalry, three bat- teries, and Charley's command, formed a line south of the works at the morning ordered, with every thing in good order, making a very fine appearance indeed. After waiting until about eleven o'clock, the boats containing "Onr General " and staff approached the landing, and the General with his staff and about three hundred orderlies debarked, and riding out on the field in front of the drawn-up troops, made a very imposing ap- pearance. But no attention was paid to the staff or escort, all.leyes being turned on "Our General" the moment lie came in sight; and   OUR GENERAL"REVIEWS TIIE TROOPS.       89 from the expression of the boys' faces, which seemed one moment to declare they recognized him, and the next to express doubt of his identity, it would seem there must be something unusual about him. A suppressed "wonder where he got it," from one, and "must have found some greeny to trust him," from another, give us the key to the matter, and a glance satisfies us that "Our General" is inside of a brand new uniform, which is passing us on a fine, cream-colored h orse.- Passing along the line to the right he started down the line, and stopping from time to time to curse this or d--n that poor fellow in the line, lie at last arrived opposite Charley's command, and stop- ping along Charley's line, glanced as keenly as those dull looking eyes of hlls were capableofloing, up and down the line; lie searched for something wrong, but failing to find anything on which he could reasonably found a complaint, and determined to get rid of a portion of his surplus spleen in some way, he disliounted, and approaching the right of the company, lie passed along in front of it from right to left, carefully scanning every buckle and button until he had nearly reached the flank, when fearing hle would be unable to find anything of which he could complain, he charged one of the boys with bleing drunk, and turning to Captain Montgomery, said: "Captain Mont- golmery, that man is drunk, and I am half inclined to cashier you for inefficiency; you evidently being unable to bring your command in proper condition on the field for review, to say nothing of con- trolling them in action." Charley bit his lip to keep down a hasty word that was struggling for utterance, and said: "I beg your pardon, General, but which one have you reference to." "Why tlat man there on the gray horse; any man can see, at even this distance, that he is so drunk as to be scarCely able to sit his hlorse." The man referred to was a strict temperance man; he not only re- fusing to drink alcohol in any shape, but would not drink even coffee; and when "Our General" came out with the assertion that George was drunk, even military discipline could not control the boys, andt they roared out laughing right in General Sidney's face, who, swell- ing with rage, without a word, mounted his horse and took up his position to allow the command to pass him in review. When they returned to Cairo, and for several days afterward, it was only neces- sary to say, "George, you are drunk," to set the whole mess laughing.   90          LEAVE OF ABSENCE. The men in Captain Montgomery's, company were delighlted very soon after the review at hearing that Jim O'Ialler had been pro- ilote(d to Captain and A. ). C. on General Sidney's staff. Thie va- cancy in the company was filled by the promotion of Robert Costello to the First Lieutenancy, and John Prince was made Second Lieu- tenant, in the place vacated by the promotion of Lieut. Costello. The men hardly knew whether to be more pleased with the separa- tion from O'Haller, or with the promotion of John Prince, who was a very great favorite with the men. Frank Blackwood, whlo also had grown greatly into the favor of the men, was made Orderly Sar- geant. It was now coming near Christmas, and the desire of Charley ,and John to get back on a visit to those they had left behind, strcngthened. They had no hope that "Our General" whuld grant them leave of absence, and were really astonished one day at the re- ception of a leave for twenty days. Their joy knew no bounds, for as Charley said to John, "it was so unlooked for." The applications had been made more as a matter of form, than with any hope of se- curing leave. That afternoon Charley sought John, and said: "My boy, I'll bet you couldn't guess in a week who has sent me a letter." John guessed over about ten names, beginning with Maggie Boulton, but to each one Charlcy would give a sober shake of his head, signi- fying No.  It is from Lena," said Charley, affectionately; "' the little darling says," and Charley opened and began reading: I know, dear Charley, that you wont expect a letter from me, but I thought  you mightn't have any mother or sisters to write to you like our John has, so I am going to write. I asked mamma, and she said I could. I am going to spend an awful dull Christmas, so is mamma and Rose and Carrie. Mammla and the rest always cry whien I ask them if John and you will be home for Christmas. I do wish you liad never gone away, we were all so happy. Miss Boulton comes over here a good deal, so does her papa. I like Miss Boulton, she is so kind and nice. Tell John I pray for hin every night before I go to bed; I pray for you too. Miss Boulton told me one day that she prayed for you too, then I asked lher if she didn't pray for our John, she got red, and didn't say anything. I think Miss Boulton lilies you a good deal; I like her too. We are all well, only mamma keeps so awful sad looihng all the time. She told me one day, tthat John or you mighlt be killed anytilce, and then she cried. I do wish you could both come lhome. And now I must close. Mamn- ma said I must send you and John her love. So did Carlie and Rose. Miss Boulton came in while I was writing, and I told her wlho I was writing to, and asked her if she wanted me to send her love, like mamma anti sisters did; she just got red like she always does. She's a great girl for not answering you when you ask her things, and just getting red. And now I must close, for I'm all done with my paper. So good-bye, Charley. From "EN:A PRIN h'sc   TRAIN FOR HOME.            91 That little bit of paper from home, with a prattle on it that sounded to John Prince as if he were at homey listening to his little sister, made these two men thrill, simple as it was. Charley's voice was tremulous ere he finished it, and when it was finished, neither trusted himself^ to speak for some momnents. "We will surprise them greatly though, wont we, John?"said Charley. "Yes, and we'll get there for Christmas after all," said John, with as much satisfaction in his voice as it possessed. The company was turned over to Lieut. Costello, the boys were bade good-bye, and with light hearts our two friends took the train  for home. Charley felt that le had a most earnest desire to see Maggie] Boulton. The impression that he strove to convince himself had worn away, was there in all its depths, and Lena's letter lie felt had revived it. John Prince felt a yearning to cast himself into the arms of his tender-hearted loving mother, and to embrace his dear, affectionate sisters. And although the train thundered along at all the speed that steam would give it, both felt as though they were going only at a snail's pace. /'   CHAPTER VIII. VISIT TO IOME, AND RETURN TO CAMP. As the companions were going toward the house of John Prince's mother, after having left the train, Charley Montgomery said to John: "John, as soon as I se the folks here, I must make some endleavor to find my mother and sister. I have written several times recently, but for several months, indeed since I left for Cairo, I have heard nothing. I begin to feel right uneasy about it." "Oh, they are all right, Charley," said John, in a consoling tone; "you know the way the mails have been. You could not rely upon t them. Make yourself easy." "I have been easy, John, longer than I should," said Charley; "I don't know what may have ha'pDened them." "Your father will look after their safety, you may depend upon it." "So I have tried to make myself believe," said Charley, "and that has made me less uneasy than I would have been. But, John, I know my father is surely among the Confederates." "No, no," said John, getting himself uneasy at the thought;" your father worlenot leave your mother and sister, under the state of affairs now existing at your home." "'I only feel too certain that my fear is correct," said Charley, uneasily. "My father was always a determined opponent to the arbitrary legislation discriminating against the South, and I know very well if he'd talk that way, he'd fight that way, too." "Well, Charley, I would sympathize with you from my inmost soul, should anything happen to cause you grief. But you mustn't despond, my boy; we must present ourselves in our cheerfulest mood before my mother and sisters, for they will think we are unhappy, if we don't." "True, John," said Charley ;"I s1all endeavor to feel and look as bright as I calln. I shall feel so, I know, when I get within hearing of the voices, and within sight of the faces of your mother and sisters. And the Boultons I am also anxious to see." 92 9   A CANDID CONFESSION.         93 "Yes, one of them particularly," said John, " and it isn't the old gentleman either." Charley laughed. "I am anxious to see Maggie Boulton, John," said Charley, and his whole manner as he said it was p,,of enough of his truthfulness. "She has made an impression on me which I never thought any girl would." "Who is in love now?" said John, good humoredly, "do you recollect delivering opinions to me some eight or nine months ago?" Never mind repeating them, John," interrupted Charley; "I recollect. I did positively think that you were deeply interested in Miss Boulton." "So I was," said John, "even up to the time of our leaving I did think often and seriously of her. But it wasn't deep enough, Charley; she never was meant for me." "I, indeed, thought at one time that you certainly would woo her, and I felt confident that if you did, you would win also." "You flatter me, Charley," laughed John, "and you wrong your- self. How quickly she made you her sole correspondent after the first few letters had been divided between us."  Charley Montgomery looked uneasy. He was afraid that in such a matter his friend might distrust him even a little. "John," said Charley, soberly, "I assure you that her action in ceasing to write to you, and continuing to write to me, was entirely her own voluntary choice, as far as I know. I never used, believe me, the slightest "- "Why, Charley, old fellow, you needn't explain to me," said John Prince, laughingly; "I saw the whole thing. I saw, also, and I will not say how much I appreciated it, your efforts to firther my chances with Miss Boulton. Let us say no more about it now, but enjoy these old familiar objects, now that we are passing them. Oh, how dear to one's eyes every stone and tree seems after an absence from them, if they be near his home. These very huts look like palaces in my sight this afternoon. And these bare and leafless old trees never looked prettier to me, covered with their thickest foliage, than they do now." So the two friends walked on making comments on every familiar object they passed until the house, as they turned into the lane, appeared before them. John Prince's eyes were bedimmed imme- liately, and he lost sight of the dear old place which had been the scene of his happy childhood's days. "God bless the old place," murmured John, looking lovingly upon   "           HOME AGAIN. it. "Charley, I don't like to break right in upon them, and I don't see any good way to avoid doing so." "True," said Charley, "it might shock your mother for you to go in; suppose I go in first, and I will not leave her long in suspense." "No, I'd rather risk going in with you," said John. "If mother would sec you alone, she'd be awfully shocked." "Well then, we'll have to go right in and trust to luck." And up to the door they went. John applied his knuckle, and in a few minutes the door was opened. The winsome face of Lena looked out, wavered a moment, and then, with the cry, "O John!" she sprung into his arms. John's mothers and sisters were soon beside him, who still retained Lena in his arms, and walked in with her into the parlor. Mrs. Prince uttering the very same cry that Lena had, threw her arms around John's neck, and for a few moments neither said a word. Carrie and Rose gathered around, and John in turn embraced them. Charley had taken little Lena as soon as John had relin- quished her, and on Charley's lap, with her head on his shoulder, she seemed as though she was perfectly contented. Charley saluted the girls and Mrs. Prince affectionately, as soon as the9 could make up their minds to let'go of John. And then, with every heart full almost to painfulness with joy, they sat and talked until supper was gotten ready, which was very soon, for the two travellers were in need of something to appease the keen appetite their long ride had given them. At supper, the girls would ask all sorts of questions as to how the two soldiers lived. Did they have plenty of milk, and butter, and sugar? And did they have good tea and coffee, etc.? To the hundred questions that were asked, John said he'd give them a faith- ful account of just what was done every day. And after assuring them that from a comfortable feather-bed they arose to a neatly set table on which were all kinds of delicacies, and then, that they took a bath in season, and then sat down to a dinner of game, or roast beef, or something in that line, and a hundred other assurances of this nature which he saw the girls were taking for gospel, John did give them an account of what the daily programme was; and rather different it was, too, from his first sketch. "Miss Boulton said she'd be over this evening," said Lena to Charley, causing Charley to become affected with some of that redness that Lena had spoken of as being a peculiarity with Miss Boulton.   JOYFUL MEETINGS.          95 "She will be glad to see us," said Charley, to which Lena imme- diately rejoilfed: "She'll be glad to see you." "Lena " said Mrs. Prince, "why, how you do behave. You must be unsettled by your brother and Charley being home." Lena, said nothing more, but looked somewhat abashed by her mother's remonstrance. The truth of her remark, however, or, rather of both of ler remarks, was proven, and before long. Maggie Boulton did come, and -was glad to see Charley Montgomery. When Maggie knocked, Lena said, "I want to go let Miss Maggie in, mamma." Lena went to the door, and must have whispered to Maggie that the young soldiers were at home, for Maggie entered the dining-room, where the party still sat, with an eager expectancy in her eyes. See- ing the two friends, she immediately advanced and extended her liand to John Prince, who was the nearer one, and then went over and shook hands with Charley Montgomery. Charley's grasp was, perhaps, more hearty than a mere friendly greeting would warrant, and his smile betokened the real pleasure that lie felt. "I was going over to see you and your father to-night," said Charley. "Well, my coming will not, I hope, deprive my father of a visit,"  said Margaret Boulton, changing color very rapidly, which was being enjoyed by Lena, who watched the flushes come and go with an air that said to Charley: "I told you so." "If he would come' over here," said Mrs. Prince, "we might all enjoy their first night home together." "Yes, and that would be the better way," said John Prince, who was afraid that Charley would get over into Mr. Boulton's room and stay there. "Charley, you might go over to the hotel with Miss Boul- ton," said John, suggestively, " and then her father would, perhaps, come back with you." "If Miss Boulton is not too tired to go back immediately," said' Charley; "or, no-she can rest a moment while I wash myself and brisk up a little; I feel soiled coming off that train." And Charley went on up to his own room, and with an affectionate glance at everything in' the room, which was nearly in the same con- dition as when he left it, gave himself a refreshing bath, and brushed his clothing until it " looked like new." His exertion certainly worked an improvement in his appearance.   96        AN AGREEABLE TETE-A-TETE. He was, indeed, a fine-looking fellow, re-entering the dining-room with his handsome uniform on, where the fatmily and Miss Boulton still sat. Charley and Maggie Boulton started off to the hotel, promising to be back, accompanied by Mr. Boulton, as soon as possible. Leaving John's mother and sisters enjoying llis company, of which they seemed unable to get enough, we must be ungallant enough to accom- pany Charley and Maggie Boulton. Neither seemed to know how to begin a conversation once they were out, and walking along the road. Charlny belt very haplpy, and secItly wished that the liotel was just about ten miles distant. At last Maggie said: "Mr. Mont- gomery, do you like a soldier's life?" "I rather do like the life, Miss Boulton," said Charley. "I, of' course, would like to be stationed nearer to some fi'iends;" and Charley laid particular stress on the word "friends." "I guess it is lonely for you," said Maggie. "It is lonely for us, too, since you went away. Papa was saying a few days ago, that we K missed you as much as though we had been used to your society for years." This was all said quietly enough, but it gave Charley a great deal of pleasure. I am very grateful for the kindness of yourself arid your father, Miss Boulton," said Charley. "You have both been very kind to me." Your service to my father certainly deserved it," said Mggie. If it were not for your generous conduct, when my father first met you, my father might now, perhaps, be totally ruined." "Oh, you might hardly mention that," said Charley. "I would only have been as great a knave as the others-worse, indeed, had I closed my eyes to the advantage that was being taken of him." "He deeply appreciates your conduct, Mr. Montgomery," said Maggie; " and, indeed, he would be very unlike my father, if he didn't." "I am grateful for his appreciation," said Charley, feeling as if he'd trlade off the world for permission to throw his arms around the form beside him, "for I know you share it." "I do share it, Mr. Montgomery," said Maggie, earnestly, " and I think it would be very ungrateful in lme did I not. It was as much for me as for him."     -  "More," said Charley, with a warmth that ratlher startled Maggie   4 A HAPPY REUNION.           97 Boulton. "I hope you will excuse me, Miss Boulton, for saying it, I)ut it was, in(Jeed, more for you than for him." - Maggie Bo1ulton was silent for a few nmoments, and Charley was afraid he had gone too flar. "I hope you will excuse me, Miss Boulton," said he, "if I have offended you?" "You have not ofended mne.'" I thank you," said Charley; "I would not wilfully do so for the world .; andt even to unintentionally wound you, would pain me deeply,  did I discover it." They soon reacted the hotel, and proceeded to Mr. Boulton's room. The old getleman was in, reading a paper, and was as delighted as hle was astonished to see Charley. 'Upon the aim of their visit being told him, he at once acquiesced, and putting on his coat and hat, went back with Maggie and Charley to Prince's. That nighlt was spent happily by the little party nt Prince's. Songs were sung, and occasionally a tale of tleir soldier life was related by John or Cllrley. And when the party dispersed, it had been agreed lupon tlhat the Christmas-eve and Christmas night should be spent at Prince's. That night Lena was kissed good-night by Charley Montgomery, and it seemed to make his happiness complete. "Did you think your Christmas will be so awfilly dull, pet?" asked Charley of Lena, as he was about going up to his room. "No, not now, with my brother and you home. But I know tlhat if my brother wasn't here my mother would be very sad." Charley thought of his own niother and sister, and pictured them alone, and in danger. His mind wandered continually from Miaggie Boulton to his mother and sister, and falling into a sounil sleep, he dreamed of the three, and thought he saw them all together. In the morning he thought of his dream, and lie thought how com- pletly happy lie would be if' he only had his niother and sister with him at Priince's, for just one little hour. He reflected so much upon it, that he could resist no longer the imlpulse to seek them out, and with the determination to go at once, he wnent to John Prince, and told him of his design. "Tut, nonsqnse, Charley," said John Prince; "\.why, you musn't think of such a thing. Here's to-morrow, Christmas-eve, and yen tal;ilig about going away from us on an altogether unnecessary tral1) p." "If I could persuade nyself that it is unnecessary," said Charley,    98          A NEW PROJECT. "I would, of course, drop all thoughts of it but it's the other way. I dreamed of my mother and sister last night, and although I am not the least superstitious "- "Just what every one says who believes in dreams," broke in John. ," Of course you don't believe in dreams, Wand yet you aro going to let one tear you away from us just at the time of all others when you should be with us.- It is too bad." ("I am sorry that I will mar the pleasure of the season at your house, John, but I can't help it. I will take a train south to-day." John Prince knew very well that Charley meant what he said. "Well, I am pretty much disappointed, Charley," said John, " and my disappointment is nothing to that which will be caused at home." "Why, John, you can keep them all alive until I get back." "I am going with you," said John, calmly. "You going with me!" repeated Charley, in astonishment. "W Why, what in the world are you thinking about?" "About going with you, as I said before," returned John. "I am certainly going with you. I could never reconcile the idea in my mind, of your travelling south, alone, weather like this. It hails lead down there about this time, and I guess I'll go along." Charley could have embraced the devoted fellow. But he tried all he could to dissuade him from going. He appealed to him to think of the girls, and of his mother. All to no purpose. "They are perfectly saife," said John, "1 and I can afford to trust them one with the other." That night when the projected southern trip was broached, it threw, as the companions knew it would, a gloom over all. But Charley could not relinquish the idea, and John would not let him go alone. The separation of the family for that night was very different in character from their previous night's parting. No one was cheerful or lively. All were sad and dejected. The next day was a bitter cold day--the day before Christmas. Leaving saddened hearts behind, John and Charley had started for the train. Word was left at the house, to tell Mr. Boulton and his daughter of the circumstance, and to ask their excusal of the sudden departure. The two companions passed in the road, on their Nway, a carriage containing some forms, but whether of males or females they couldn't tell in the darkness of the carriage, the persons sitting well back. The carriage drove to the office of Capt. Sidney, and the driver got out and entered the office. Presently an elderly gentleman came   CR ss-PUrn posi sc..         99 out and went over to the carriage. H-e leaned far i, and talked withl sonre one that wavs in the clrriagre. "O1, yes," said the elderly geintt, "that's my son. He used to be here, and here's where he did have his office. You see we both officed together, ma'amn.  He hadn't a great' press of business oil hand at any time, and there was plenty of room for us both, you see." The lady in the carriage, for it was a lady, as the address of the elerly gentleman would indicate, asked some further questions, the answers to which were all carefully wrapped up in about three minutes each of ceneral information, given gratis by the elderly gentleman. Ultimnately the carriage was turned ibr the hotel, and arriving there, the lady, who was accompanield by another, a younger lady, alighted, and they went into the hotel, where they inquired for Mr. Boulton. Being shown to lhis room, the older lady asked Mr. Boulton, who answered their knock, if he could give them any information of' Charles Montgomery. "Why, yes, indeed, lie could that." The old gentleman said no 1(orc, )but getting himself reatly,w went (down stairs with. the ladies, and got into the carriage witl them, tlhere being room enough, and told the driver to go to Prince's. lthe-lady informed Mr. Boulton, on the way to Prince's, tht she was the mllothler of Charley, and that the young lady was his sister. The goodllear ted 1Mr. Boulton pleasantly anticipated the treat lie hIad in store for Charley, and upon getting to Prince's, was all iimpaticnce to bring Charley and' his mother andt sister together. Imnagine the old gentlemain's astonishment at first, and( sorrow afterwards, when Mrs. Prince and the girls told him that the two had started off that morning to find Charley's mother. Mrs. Montgomery was also very much grieved, as was her daughllter, who looked very tmuc h like Charley. Mr. Boulton said nothingl but rusling out got into the carriage, ' ah icsl was just about leaving, and told the driver to drive with all 'peed to the station. Thither the drliver went at a pace that probably astonished the horse that was executing it, las much :l s it did tie few pedestrians that were looking on, until the station was reachedl.  Tlhe hllistle Head just blown for the train to proceed when Mr. Boulton jumnlped out. "Stop! stop!" shouttedl the old gentleman, in a way that tlrelatenled to stop his wind effectually. For a fbw minutes the train moved slowly along, and theIn in response to a sort of a snort tlhat the whistle gave, down went the brake;., and the train came to a stalnd still. Mr. Boulton clambered upi onl the hn car, Iwaiting to give no I   100       THE TRAVEILLERS OVEnrTAKEN. explanation. to the conductor, who looked upon him as a lunatic escaped from his keeper, but rushed through car after car until he reached the very first, where lie found Charley and John smoking cigars. "Come, Charles, John," said Mr. Boulton, breathless with the exertions he had made. Both were thunder-stricken; they looked appealingly at Mr. Boul- ton, and irresistibly began to share in the belief of the conductor, who had followed and demlanded an explanation from Mr. Boulton, and, from whom he got a convincing and a- very satisfactory one, which he privately folded up and placed in his wallet, and asked no more ques- tions of Mr. Boulton. As soon as Mr. Boulton got his .breath, lie explained to Charley that his mother and sister were at Prince's. Charley looked incredible, and half suspected the veracity of Mr. Boulton. But he could not openly doubt that gentleman, so with John Prince, who was inclined to dance for joy, and Mr; Boulton he got off the train, which immne- diately proceeded, and the three entered the carriage and were driven back to Priince's. No description could possilIy do justice to that scene. Charley and hi s mother and sister, and Jolln's mothler and sisters hardly less over- joyed than if John had just secured a respite from execution; there was happiness of the most genuine kind in the parlor of the Princes that nighlt. Their Christlms eve was a happy one, rendered nmore happy by the occurrences of the day. Charley was not forgetful of the service of Mr. Boulton but, on the contrary, was most profoundly grateful. After he had embraced his mother and sister, and had in- troduced them to those present, Charley went over to Mr. Boulton  S and grasping him by the hand said: "Mr. Bou1ton, words would but poorly express my gratitude for your service to me and to my mother and sister to-night, but I wish to assure you that I'll never forget it." "Donl't mention it at all, Charles," said Mr. Boulton; "m y service would compare but poorly with that which you performled for me; so we'll say nothing about it. I aml, going back for Maggie. Will you go? It is a shamne for me thougll to ask you from youir mlother alnd sister so soonY. Charley went, hlowever, assuring llhis nother and sister tlhat lie would be gone but a short tilie. And he was true to his word, as lie always was, tfr in less than an hour he returned with Maggie Boulton, botlh looking extrenmely well pleased and happy. Mr. Boulton wouldl join   SOCIAL ENJOYMENTS.           101 them in the evening, Charley saidl, as he hadl some business to do that would detain him a little while. This assurance seemed -to giive ai great deal of pleasure to Mrs. Prince, Charley thought. Another "sign of the times " that Chiarley observed was that John Prince was getting along, fatmotlsly with his sister, Susie Montgomely; and Charley was compelled to admlit to himself llis sister appeared to be progressing just as faimously with John Prince. In the evening some few friends came, and before an hour had gone Mr. Boulton also arrived. To overflowing were the hearts of tie happy plarticiplants filled with joy and pleasure during that and the succeeding  night, Christmas night, which, also, was spent in Prince's. It would be difficult to tell which was the happiest of the happy party. The days wore on and the leaves of absence were drawing to a close. Charley had arranged that his motler and sister should stay at Prince's. Charley had also visited Jem Ovens, and had a lengthy talk with him as to the mines of Mr. Boulton.  Jem's brother, Wully, had entirely recovered. long since, and he and his brother -were living in a new Iotis(e, vcry nicely located and comfortably ap)pointed, which had been   t built for them by Mr. Boulton.  Charley found out bothl from Mr. Botulton and froln Jem Ovens that, for Mr. Botlton at least, the send- ing of Jemn home had been very fortunate. Jem had arrivedjust in season to prevent Mr. Boulton from selling his section at about one- third its real valuc, and lhaving taken filll supervision of the work lChad made it prove exceedingly lucrative to Mr. Boulton. Jem did itich I more than might have been expected froml him.  Mr. Boul- tot not beingl very well informed in the lead business, Jenl exercised a  watchlful care over every brancel of it, firom  the sinking of the shafts to the sale of the product to the comnlission merchants. The evening before thie departure of the twoifriends for their com- pany at last arrived, and it was also spent inl Prince's. The mirth was of t mlore subdued kind than that which had marked their previous gatherings. John and Chalrley were the only ones who seemed really cheerful. Charley sung his most clheerful songs and John told his raciest anecdotes of camp life, but the effects would be but temporary, a  general air of depression would soon overspread the countenances of the- others. Fond mothers and affectionate sisters sickened in their very hearts as the unwelcome thoughlt would force itself that per- haps never again would those light-lhearted songs and pleasant tales be heard by them, trom these two who were to part from them in the morning. With all the pain of the anticipation of another parting   102            PARTING. on the morrow, the party separated for the night. Reluctantly did Charley bid Lena "good-night." He had again become used to her sweet, innocent "good-night" kiss. Lena appeared to hesitate, too, and Charley asked her what it meant. "You have found your own sister now, you know, Charley," said Lena, "and I guess you wont want to kiss me 'good-night!" "Why, pet, I'd kiss you good-night if I had discovered a dozen sisters," said Charley, smiling at the odd thoughts of the little girl. The sadness of parting in the morning was much lessened by the presence of Mfr. Boulton and Maggie, and of Mrs. and Susie Montgomery. John said to Susie in a flippant, good-natured way: "Your brother's dull camp life is brightened by an occasional letter from Miss Boulton. I think you might be humane enough to do the same kindness for me." Susie said, that if sonic one already kept Charley supplied with letters, that she didn't see why she shouldn't write to John. And so it was agreed upon that the two should correspond. Charley, who had also been attending to prospective letters, seemed to be entirely satisfied with whatever arrangements he had made, which doubtless will transpire hereafter. ALnd now the last hour that remained had come.  There was a good deal of crying  on the part of the ladies in the party, and the eyes of both John and Charley were not without a transient diimness caused ly a momentary flooding up of full hearts. The last hand-shaking was over, and the two young soldiers were off. Mr. Boulton accolmpanied them to the train, and then returned to the house. The ride back, of Charley and John, was not quite as pleasant as had been their ride home. However, if they had not the pleasant anticipations of their homeward ride, they had their pleasurable remembrances. Both appeared to be quite happy, and when they began to talk, John first began about Charley's sister Susie, and Charley would confound Maggie Boulton's name with that of his sister. The return of the two officers to their company was hailed by the men with unfeigned satisfaction, although all spoke highly of Lieut. Costello, who had been in command. Charley lost no time in reporting himself to General Sidney, to wlhom he reported, also, John Prince's return, and before long the two friends were again "at home" among the boys of the company.   CORRESPONDENCE.          103 Many a dull cold day was brightened, for John Prince, by a letter from Susie Montgomery, and almost invariably the day John would get one from Susie, Charley would receive one from Maggie Boulton. Lena, too, wrote an occasional letter, sometimes to John, and some- times to Charley. And when it is added, that from their respective mothers and sisters, the two friends got regular letters, it will be seen that, in this respect, they were very well attended to.   CHAPTER IX. IN WHCH CHARLLEY GETS SO ME SERVICE TO PERIFORM WHCH IS INTENDED TO FINISH IIIS MORTAL CAREER, BUT WHCH ONLY REDOUNDS TO HS, CREDIT, IF NOT TO IIIS ADVANTAGE. THE. whole topic ill tte camp was the m3ysterious shooting of pickets thlat had been going on for some time. What deepened the mystery was that one post in particular-Post No. 13, on the 2nd Relief--appeared to be the one selected for the deadly aimn of whoever the assassin was. An order was circulated, bearing the signature of "Our General," setting forth that it had come to his notice that sentinels had been fired upon and killed, and tlhat it was deemed advisable by him, tjlat all the women and children within a radius of six miles, should be arrested, and brought into camp.  Jim O'Hallcr was placed in conmmand of the arresting party, which he divided into three sections, one of wh1ich he took charge of himsclf. The prescribed limit was attended to as directed )by the order, and scene's of the most heartsickcling miscl y were the result. Terrorise'd women and children, and feeble old men, scarcely able to totter along, were brlought back by the party. O') Ialler camped them in a muddy swamp near to the fortifications at Bird's Point. He seemed to take an especial 1)ple aure in augmenting, in every way practicable, their already pitiably miserable condition. And in the discharge of his duties, as per order of "Our General," he seemed to have determined to be as harsh, and as brutal as possible. After their return, Clfharley, in a conversation with one of the men who had been of O'tIaller's party, lelarned that he had not only treated them harshly, but had actually robbed them. "The first thing the Captain would ask," said the man, " would be, ' Whar's your coins? And then he'd make a most carefill search for Awatchies and jewelry, and( silverware, and in fiact everythinr of vallue that was porta ble. In response to the look of disgust and indignation from hs ,meni,"  the man continued, " the Captain snaid he' look after the valualbles for fear they might get mislaid; that he'was responsible, and wanted to talke care of his own namte."  And much more, in detail, the man told 104 4   CRUEL TREATMENT.           105 Charley, that made his blood boil with indignation. Charley thought of his own mother and sister at home, defencelest, and altogether at the mercy of the soldier that was inclined to be brutal, sliould-the army reach his home. Charley visited the reservation whlere the higlly dangerous pri- soners were kept, and it pained him to see how uncomfortable tlwir position was.' From one lady, with whom he conversed, lie ]earlel that what the men had told him concerning O'Haller was all too true. Tears started into the eyes of the heart-crushed woman before him, as she related to him how O'Haller had in person entered her house, and abruptly ordered lher to get ready to leave; that she would have.  tried to bear with her own arrest, but tlhat her almost dying father was also ordered to go with' her. "He is here," she said, chokling with sobs; "and I'm afraid he will scarcely live to get back." Charley promlised to do whlat he could to improve not only the condition of herself and father, but that of them all. Strange as it may seem, the shooting at the very saime post coln- tinued, notwithstanding the energetic measures taken by "Our General,"' in having the women and clhildren and dying men taken into camnp. "I'd put that AMontgomery and his company on picket, if 'twas me, said Captain O'Haller, to "Our General," one morning, when the whole camp was amazed at the mystery. "Yes, and hlave thlem successfully put an end to this strange affair, and go up higher than ever in the estimation of the camp," said General Sidney. "No, no; they are too well thought of now." "Well, you of course do as you please ; but if 'twas me, I'd give 'em a chance for the glory.  There's -t good deal of death about tlhat glory, Cap." O'Haller still called Sidney Cap, unless when in presence of others, and very often even theIn. "I'll thilnk about it," said the General, and, as was usual, wlhen he thought about the suggestions of O'Haller, lie decided to adopt tlhe advice. Cllarley's company was ordered on picket duty. On his way out to the reserve post, Charley was sincerely pleased, in passing the "prisoners"' camp, to find thlat his exertions in thheir beihalf had been successful. Arrived at the reserve post, Chabrley proceeded to tell the men off into reliefs. He felt very reluctant to order ativ of his imen on thle post which llad been certain death to so many brave nllen ; and, as the gthillgr wszS well known to all the Men, they soon observedl the uncasi-  ness of thcir Captain. Indeed, the luetstion as to who sh.,uld go oin ti e post had given the menl themlselves a good deal of ulneasiness.   106         THE DANGEROUS POST. Flrank Blackwood approached Charley, and said : "Captain, I will go on Post No. 13, of the 2nd Relief, for this turn." Charlly looked at Frank Blackwood, admiringly, but said: "You must not o on11 that or any other, orderly ; you will have other service to perform." "I would like to volunteer for that post, Captain," said Frank, with a manner that attested his sincerity. Charley talked a few moments to Lieutenants Costello and Prince, and then, turning to Frank Blackwood, said, with great concern: "Frank, I am going to place you on No. 13." Those of the men who heard the remark looked quite relievedl for it was considered- among them the  equivalent of death to go on that post. Framlk," said Charley, anxiously, " there should be no necessity for me to say how careful you must be. You are fully acquainted with the history of that post." During the afternoon, Frank Blackwood was the lion. The men couldn't but adlnire the bravery of the man who would volunteer to  go on duty on such a post. Lieutenants Costello and Prince had " chats Nithl him also. "I will be hovering around, Frank, my hoy," said John Prince; "I will do what I can to assist you in unravelling this nmystery." When the hour came for Frank to take his post, he was shaken hllltlds with by Charley and Costello, and John Prince, as though he were going on a journey that would occupy years. And some-f' liis more intimate companions with saddened hearts bade him G6ld icod ; knowing the danger he was threatened with; and at the same time deeply feared he would never return alive. As the midnight hour approached, Capt. Montgomery began to feel very anxious, for at that time the sentinel had mostly been fired upon at Post 13. He was murmuring a prayer for the safety of Frank Blackwood, whom not only Charley, but the entire company respected and loved, when his heart sunk at the sound of a rifle-shot. "Poor Frank!" said Charley, springing to his feet, and rushing in the direction of Frank's post. i He had hardly ejaculated "Poor Frank," when two shots were heard. Bringing a relief with him, Captain Montgomery hastened toward the post. In most painful suspense lie looked in the direction of Frank Blackwood, and was overjoyed to see him in a perpendicular position, which lie thought was a pretty fair sign. With Frank was John Prince. "I guess we've got to the end of this business, Captain," said Frank Blackwood.   !"            DEATH OF THE DESTROYER.         107 "Who fired?" asked Chlarley, scanning in every direction as far as he could. I did, for one," said Frank, "and you might look in this direc- tion, and in that, for a month, and not find out who did for the j    other."  And then Frank pointed toward an old tree tlhat stood about     fifty yards off. "There's our coon, Calptain," said Frank. "From I    tthe top of that tree came the bullet tlhat made this hole," and Frank. stuck his finger in a hole that was in his hat, just near enough tO where his skull had been to make him again shudder at its fearful proximity. Charley immediately ordered the men to surround the tree. Sure enough, there was a large hole in the bottom of the tree, which was large anli hollow to the very top; inside the tree, at the bottom, lay the body of a dead man. They pulled him forth, and took him into camp. Frank was as much astonished as were any of the rest of them, that his aim had been so true. He had seen the head and sloulders of the man, above the top of the lhollow tree, and almost as soon as the flash of the man's gun showed Frank his face, Frank had fired back; his shot taking effect between the man's eyes. One of the men recognized the. body as being that of a half-crazy hunter, who lived in a hut in the vicinity. He had often vented his anger on the men for makling game scarce in the neighborhood, but the men had only laughed at him. As "Our General " had surmised, Charley's company did rise in the estimation of the entire camp, and Frank Blackwood particularly was. lionized. It spread like wildfire that Capt. Montgomery's company had solved the mystery of Post No. 13. It was confirmed by the re- scinlding of the order by which the women and chldren were, brought in, and those poor half-dead -prisoners were released and returned to their llomes. Capt. O'Haller's precautions to retain an unblemllished reputation were unavailing, for it was a widely circulated rumor that tlhat honest nlan had made about five thousand dollars through his guardianship. To testify in a proper way his appreciation of his General's many kindnesses, Capt. O'Haller presented him with a very fine gold watch, to which was attached a very heavy chain, that bothered the General a good deal to display, on account of the cut of his uniform. The nlen noticed that "Our General" and Capt. O'Haller were both pretty well decked ollt with jewelry; the wearing of a fine breastpin each, compelling both to wear shirts, which probably neutralized the pleasure they derived from the wearing of the hand- some breastpins.   108        CAPTURE OF FORT HEN RY. Early in February, marching orders were issued. Thle army 'lnoved on up the Ohio river in transports, entering the mouth of the Tenlessee at Paducah. Proceeding then to within four miles of an cannonworks, built by the Confederates, near the line dividing the States of Tennessee and Kentucky the troops debarked, and went into camp for the night. The enterprise on foot was to capture Fort Henry. "Our General" had .iven orders for the gunboats to open fire on the fort at eleven clock A. M., and commenced marching his troops- around a bavyot tliat ran between him and the fort, and which he calculated would take hnm ablout long enough to get around to-bring him to the fort 1about the right time to invest it with his land force. At eleven o'clock, according to orders, the fire was opened by the gunboats upon thie fort, and in a little more than two hours the fort was sur- rendered to Commodore Foote. About two hours afterwards, "Our General " arrived at the fort, very muchl (chIlgrined at the way the thng had turned out. Three thousand five hundred men, with their officers, had retreated frorn the fort, and General Sidney knew that they would add quite an important item  to the garrison of Fort Donelson, eleven miles further east. IKnowinwg that it would be useless to attempt to capture the retreating troops now, tihe General ordered the men into camnp. During the six days tlhat they remained at this point, Charley Montgomery and Jolhn Prince were enabled to write home.- Letters were also received from  lhonle. On the sixth day orders to march were again given. "We are going to liave a tough time ahead, John," said Charley to John Prince; "this project is to capture Fort Donelson, and, as fiar as my opinion goes, it will be a warm job." "How many men are grarrisoning the fort o " asked John. "About eighteen thousand, as near as I could make out last night," returned( Charley. "A ndll we have, under Sidney, over forty.-six thousand men, without coultiing the nalval forces," said John. "It would seem to me that we shouldl make short work of them." "You ftorget the situation of the fort," said Charley; " in addition to the natural' advantages of the situation, they have most'ingeniously fortified the place. Ilowever, if 'Our General ' will only firstget sober, and then keep sober, and give us half a chance, I believe we can put the Stars and Stripes over the place in two or three davs." "That he will not do, you   may depend upon it," said John, emphatically.   SURRENDER OF FORT DONELSON.         109 I "So much the worse then, unless, indeed, he'd cave under an extra load, and let McC----d run the whole fight, in which case we'd take that fobrt in twenty-fbur hours, as sure as shooting,? said Cllarley. "Yes, but that's too good to expect, CliarleV," said John. "In the first place he can't get that way; no quanltity of the stuff would )  make him so." "It certainly appears so, John," said Charley. The march was about to commence, and the young officers took their positions with their company. The column moved on, and coming upon the Confederate outposts drove them in. The troops were at once drawn up in line of battleand continuing to advance, and at the same tiime deploying in different directions, had by night-fiall estab- lished their line in close' proximity to the enemy's outer works. But as this is not intended las a history of the late war, and as the reader has doubtless long ago read 2all about the general details of the prin- cipal battles, we will omit the description of the fight in which Fort Donelson was taken by -tlhe troops under Sidney. Shortly after the surrender of Fort Donelson, the rumor spread that "Our General" had been relieved of his command. The great- est satisfaction was caused to the men by the report. "Cliarley," said John Prince, joyfully, upon hearing of it; "we are to get rid of Sidney at last, aint we?" "I am a little slow to believe it, John," said Charley., "I know that Gen. Smitli has been placed in command by Gen. HalIeck; but, that only relieves Sidney from field service here for the present. Sidney lhas gone to Fort Henly, and I am satisfied will be ill com- mand again before long." "Whv, it's current among the men that lie has been relieved for drunkenness and for blundering," said John, not wishing to give up so readily his gratifying impression. "Notwithstanding there is plenty of' ground for the rumor, I do not credit it," said Charley. "Sidney has friends that will keep him where lhe is, even if lie sacrifices the interests of the country." "I earnestly llope tlat your ppinion as to Ilis resuming, command of us is not correct," said John. "I never feel safe with him in charge, and I believe that feeling is general with the men." "We came here to take what comes/' said Cliarley, resignedly, "and we must do it, you know." The troops were only under command of Gen. Stmith a short time, when Sidney again took comm uand of them, and a few days afterward   "O      BATTLE OF PITTSBURG LANDING. they left for Savannah, a smzall town on the upper Tennessee, where they arrived and left a portion of their number, the remainder of them going off on transports to Pittsburg Landing. Here they encampedd, within twenty-one miles of Gen. Johnston's Confederate force of about one hundred and twenty thousand men. The design wavs that an army should be formed here with which to invest Corinth. Fresh troops now arrived continually, and on the fourth day Charley and his company arrived and reported to Gen. McC--d, who was in command. Charley was promptly given scouting service to perform, in which he was as usual very suc- cessfill. Complete accounts were day by day b)rought in as to the strength and disposition of the enemy's troops. Gen. Johnston did not wait for the attack that was being arranged against him, but himself began the fight-one of the most bitterly contested field engagements of modern times. John Prince and Charley being on the commanding officer's staff, got their full portion of the dangers of the day, and both nmade miraculous escapes from death. Near to the end of the fight, Charley got a minnie ball in his right ankle. Finally the enemy were driven from the field. Notwithstanding Charley's wound, he, after having it dressed, imme- diately set about writing a letter to Maggie Boulton, who, he thought, would hear of the fight and of his wound, and become anxious on his account. John Prince also wrote a long letter to his mother describ- ing the fight. The second day after the fight, when Charley was finishing his letter, John Prince came in and hinded Charley a despatch, which had been addressed by Mr. Boulton to John Prince. It had just been brought to John from Fort Henry, and ran: "Charles Montgomery's name appears among those killed at the Pittsburg fight. We are all exceedingly worried about it. Please answer." "What did you do?" queried Charley. "Why, of course, I answered back that you were all right." "Thank you, John," said Charley. "I'm glad you did, for I wouldn't liave them worrying themselves over my death, just yet, you know." "They will get our letters soon," said John, "and they will ex- plain everything." "Il have mine nearly finished now," said Charley; "I' would like to have it get there as soon as possible." "Well, I'll take,it and mine both in a little while. I want to add a few lines to my own." -,   "ETTER FROM JOlHN PRINCE.         1 They were b)oth scratching away as rapidly as they could in a few minutes afterwlard, z. I having finished their letters, which were both very long, John took them to the "post-man." Charley's letter will, of course, remtain private; but John's we will listen to as Mrs. Prince reads it to the little party assemblled in the parlor, comprising Rose, Carrie and Lena Prince, Mrs. Montgomery and Susie, and Mr. Boul- ton and MaLggie. Witlhout reading the affectionate greeting, and assurances of fond remembrances, which she had read over and over to herself, Mrs. Prince at once opened the part about the battle: "On Sunday morning about five o'clock, the enenmy commenced firing on our pickets, but this didn't astonish us any, for it was colnmon. I went around to the cook-fire about half past five, to get a light for my cigar, and was stooping to get a brand for the lurpose, when a shell came tearing through the trees and over the tent. The noise these shells make, as I told you before, is horrible. Soon more shells, and then grape and canister shot commenced to fly, and in a short time the line was folrmed, and the battle commenced in earnest. With terrible fierceness it raged the entire day. There was a cessation of hostilities at nighlt, it getting too dark to recognize one line from the other. The da'tkness was increased by a storm which arose in the evening. The clouds hovered over us in thickl folds as it were, and they appeared to hang over the tree-tops. Soon after the clouds formed, the lightnings flashed and the thunder rolled until the ' e was truly terrific. It was positively appalling. It seemed that t!le elements were unitinxg thheir war with that which we were carrying on below. Thle two blended in a manner that was grand but awfil. The clouds seemed united to the earth by the leavy volumes of smoke from the battle-field; the lighlltning would scarcely gleam through the cleft cloud, before a shell bursting high tup in the ait would seem another lightning flash, and we were not wanting, in the cannon's roar, for plenty of accompanying thunder. Thle scene deeply impressed the men. I was myself awe-inspired. A drenching rain fell towards nine o'clock, and until midnight in unceasing torrents it came down. Thle following morning was very foggy, and before it cleared away the battle began again. The most unflinching bravery was displayed by the Inen on both sides, and until near noon it was impossible to tell upon whichi side the victory would rest. About three o'clock in the afternoon, however, the enemy began to waver, and about four it became certain that thle (ay was ours. Charley Montgomery, who is as brave a manl as there was in the battle, got a ball in!his right ankle. Tile surgeon   "2         COMPARATIVE MERITS. says it will not trouble him much, otherwise Clarley is well, as I, 'too, am." "There is more," said Mrs. Prince, who had ceased occasionally, overcome by emotion, in reading the letter, " but it would be of no interest for you to hear it."   j A conversation now sprung up, consisting principally of comments upon the two young officers. "No one would think," Mrs. Prince said, "that such a fine, quiet, young fellow as Charley Montgomery was, would turn out such an excellent soldier." Maggie Boulton, with her old chronic blush, said, "I, too, received a letter, in which Mr. Montgomery says as much about your son's bravery in battle, as your son said of him." Mrs. Prince's eye kindled with pride; "John was always manly," said she, "even when he was quite young. I am glad, the two are together since they are there at all." "It is my chiefest consolation that they are side by side," said Mrs. Montgomery. "It makes me feel as though nothing could befall one, as long as the other is near him." Each one in turn, expressed satisfaction on account of the fortunate circumstance of the friends being in the way of helping each other. Soon they were speculating on how soon they might expect the two home on another visit, and the sooner the supposed time of the visit was set, the more pleased looking were the faces of each one in the party. Mrs. Prince even went so far as to express the belief that they would be home for good before the ensuing Christmas, but Mr. Boulton warned them not to be too sanguine about that. The next day the letters were answered, and the answers mailed. Mr. Boulton also wrote to Clarley, sending a paper along, and saying to Clarley that lie guessed he'd like to see his own death recorded. After the camp had been set to rights, the dead buried, and tho wreck resulting froni the battle somewhat attended to, the troops comnienced moving by divisions. With that under Gen. MC---d, Charley's company moved; the company was less twenty men by the Pittsburg Landing fight. Charley found plenty of work in reconnoitering the ground covered by the front of the First Division, during the advance on Corinth. This occupied about three weeks, at the end of which time the army, finding themselves in close proximity to extensive earthworks constructed by the enemy, every move was made with the utmost precaution. Judging from the ultimate result the movements were made too slowly, for pa:inted logs, with effigies of artillerymen,   NEWSPAPER COMMENTS.          113 were all that were found by the men when they reached Corinth. Taking advantage of the extremely cautious movements of "Our Gen- eral," or Gen. Halleck, who was in personal command of the Federal forces, the Confederates had quietly walked out of Corinth, and had gone "On to Richmond," where they re-enforced Gen. Longstreet. It was now that the letters, and the newspaper from Mr. Boulton, calle to hand, and Charley-and John enjoyed them very much. After reading, of the letters was gone through with, Clharley showed John the newsplaper with his own death recorded in it, and the two fell into quite a lengthy conversation about it. After a while, Clharley turned to another part of the paper, and commenced reading an account of the battle of Pittsburg Landing. Soon his face showed him to be quite amused. "Listen to this, John," he said, and commenced reading: "Gen. Sidney, who had been recklessly riding along the lines during the entire day amid the unceasing storm of bullets, grape, and shell, now rodle from right to left inciting the men to stand firm, etc.' John, what do you think of that for a good one?" said Charley, laughing. "Well, that's pretty fair, especially about him riding recklessly during the entire day. I saw when lie came off the boat at the landing, and it was after two o'clock in the afternoon." "Yes, I remember," said Charley, "it was at least as late as that, and he was in just such a condition as would make him ride recklessly, if at all." "That's sarcastic, about inciting the men to stand firm, isn't it?" said John, laughing. "It does look tlat way," said Clharley. "I guess if the men dared they would have felt inclined to urge him to sit firmly on his horse, for lie looked as though he were going to fall off continually." "That's the way fame comes, my boy," said John. "  Oh, well," said Charley, "I guess 'Our General ' will never deceive anybody but a few gullible people who swallow everything that's in a newspaper." "Yes, and that's everybody," said John; "a newspaper, ,an in- fluential one I mean, does a great deal in moulding opinion. Men are influenced, unconsciously, by newspapers." "Well, that's the barefacedest lie I ever saw in a paper in my life,) said Charley. "Wly the fellow that wrote it couldn't have been; within five miles of the ground." i Those are the very fellows that, with pen and ink, convert a rascal: and a drunkard into a first class hero, nevertheless," said John. 8.   "4           SPURIOUS FAME. "Well, I shouldn't want such fame," said Charley. "There's where you differ with men of ' Our General's' nature," said John. "{He wants fame, no matter how it's manufactured, and no matter who else is sacrificed in its getting." "I'd like to keep this account of the fight as a curiosity," said Charley, " but I must show it to Lieut. Costello. He will enjoy it too." Not only Lieut. Costello, but the whole company read that highly accurate account of the battle, and "'Our General's' ride lip and down the line," was looked upon as a capital piece of fun.   CHAPTER X. OXIX)RD. CHARLEY MON TGOMERY and John Prince, as were all the men w1ho read the account of the Shiloh or Pittsburg Landing battle, as contained in the newspaper that Mr. Boulton had fbrwarded to Cllharley,. were very greatly -nmused with the pen and ink laudations thlat "Our General" received in connection with t-he Pittsburg Landing fight' but we are now going to accompany that brilliant military genius to Vicksburg, for the planning of which battle, with its attendant march and ingenious manesuvres, ' Our General" received such a stornm of newspaper applause as would have done honor to the Iron Duke in the zenith of his famle. After making some fiitile attempts at the capture of the men whom  ie had allowed to leisurely vacate Corinth, the atteDpts being produc- tive of nothing but amusement to the soberer and more serviceable officers, "Our General " settled down to his accustomed plan of harass- ing the peacefill residents of his district. In the meantime, a change had taken place in the affi irs of our- friends, Charley and John. Owing to a most important piece of service rendered by Charley tduring the Shiloh fight, wlhich service c0nolsisted in his making a charge, with a companly composed of his own mnen and about two hundred orderlies on the staff, by which a whole division, which otherwise would have escaped, wavs captured. The move having been made under circumstances tlat led to a great deal of talk over it, Charley focnd himself the recipient of invitations fronm three or four regiments, then formling through the State ofT-ttWii5s, to take the colonelcy. He decided to accept one of them, and, onil a leave of absence, proceeding to Springfieltl, he received his commission and took command of the -th Illinois Cavalry, which he brought to Corinth. John Prince has also gone up in the official scale. On Charley's communication, John was made captain of the company of scouts, Lieut. Costello remaining as first lieutenant, and .Frank Blackwood "5   iG OI' ROMOTIONS. b1ing proloted to the second lieutenancv. Chlarley and( Joln both wished Lieut. Costello to become the captain, but lie insisted that Joll Prince should have the position, and so it was arran1ged. While Charlky was away, the Governors of the Western States came down in a body to General Halleck and used every endeavor with that officer to in- duce him to remove General Sidney from that army. In vain they told Halleck that hundreds of the best men the West had sent were being uselessly sacrificed through the utter worthlessness of Sidney. Halleck insulted tie entire body, and they had hardly left his head- quarters whenIi lie promoted Sidney to the command second to his own. Even in the Congress of the United States, although the most uncon- trovertille Droofs of inactivity, and indisputable proofs of unqualified ineaDacity were given, yet, by the energetic action of the man who wns then managing Sidney, and who managed iim into the higlest office in the nation afterwards, the action of the members, about to definitely put an end to tie career of "Our General" was suspended, and grinning Deatlh exulted over the thousands of lives tiat were thus secured to him. In July, Halleck left, and Sidney once morle became ' Our General" by taking the command-in-chief. It was, probably, the energetic and continuous use of' " commissary " by the great man that illuminated his brain to such an extentals was necessalry for the conception of such a brilliant scheme as the capture of Vicksburg by the plan he formed *fir that achevement. To enable the reader to properly conceive and appreciate the stu- *pendtos mental power required, and the dazzling military genius dlis- played, it should be remembered that lMemphis is located on the Mis- sissippi River, and that Vicksburg is also situated on that river. Transports innumerable were at the service of "Our General," with capacity for the ample accommodation of his entire army of 150,000 men. A sufficient inumber of gunboats were also at his command, to en- able the translorts to carry the army in perfect safety to the vicinity of Vicksburg in a trip of about four days. In a I quiet, safe trip like tlhis, however, there would be nothing astonishing. Not a man would be killed, unless, indeed, ie might tumble in among the machinery on the boats, or meet death in some such accidental manner. No, such a commonplace, ordinary transaction is too tame for such a mental giant 1as "Our General." So, in lieu of that mode of reaching Vicksburg, he conceived the admirable plan of capturing the place by an advance over land upon it. When it is considered that the distance to be   MALRCH TO VICIKSBURG. .17 marchled over is nearly three hundred miles, it will be seen tlat it was no ordinary brain that could have perceived the many advantages  ccruing.  The niarch, in the first place, would keep the men from getting lazy. Then the clhangingl scenes on the road would stimulate them. The exercise would strengthen them, and they would be strong and hardy when, after their long march, they would come before Vicksburg.                 ,  The change that had been made did not prevent Charley and John from communicating frequently. The day before the march corm- menced, John said to Charley: "IWhat do you think of this grand project that is nlow on foot?" "Do you mean the march to Vicksburg?"' interrogated Charlev. "Yes." "Just what all think," said Charley; " that it is a piece of the most consummate nonsense ever heard of." "I was talking to Costello about it a while ago," said Joln, "and I shhre his opinion; I believe Sidney is clean clzy." "No, hardly that," said Charley; "  I am pretty certain that that move is the result of a cotilluous drunk; but I guess lie isn't any crazier than that, although the man is next door to insanity with liquor nearly all the timce." "Well, this is going to put an end to the war anyhow, I believe," sai;I John; "Sidney is going to maintain his base at Memphis, and to suppoDse that we can protect tie line communicating with his base while the army operates aressively against the fortifications at Vicksburg is nonsensical. He will get the army just so disposed of that about one-fifth of our number will come down on us and sever our line of comminunication, and we will be compelled to fall back on our base, if no worse happens." "Why the, mischief doesn't lie have the army sent down in the transports?" said Charley. "We could get there in four or five days at the farthest, and with the men in good condition." "That would be too sensible a proceeding for 'Our General.'" re- turned John. After some further discussion they separated. The next day the army commenced their march to Vicksburg; the taking of which l:liee was desirable, so as to open the Mississippi river. John Prince, as captain of the scouts with his company pre- cede the army in its march, which was tedious and wearisome. " Our   "8       VAN' DORN AND MRS. SIDNEY. General" had gotten, with the bulk of his forces, as far as Oxford. About twenty miles to his rear was Holly Springs, at which place he had a large quantity of valuable stores, consisting of commissary and quarter-master's stores, fixed ammunition, and other ordnance property. Protecting Holly Springs, at which place was the lady of "Our General," was a division, consisting of two regiments of cavalry; one of which was that of our friend Colonel Charley, and several regiments of infantry. One morning, the Confederate General Van Dorn made a dash upon the division guarding Holly Springs. Van Dorn had about seven thousand five hundred men with him. After a short fight, Van Dorn captured the entire division with the exception of the cavalry, which made good its retreat in the direction of MAemphs. Van Doin destroyed all the stores lie found in the place, paroled the officers and men, and then went to the house of the lady with whom the lady of "Our General " was stopping. He asked the lady owning the house if Mrs. General Sidney was in her house. Yes, sir," said the lady addressed; "she is in her room." "I would like to look throtugh that room, madam," said Van porn. "I have information that papers which would be valuable to me are there." "Yes; but the General's lady is in that roomn, said the lady, "and you surely would not intrude upon a lady in her chamber." "She can come out and go into some other room," said the Genenral. "I have no disposition to annoy her; it is the papers I want." "That she cannot do, sir," returned the lady. "Mrs. Sidnley is very seriously indisposed, and cannot leave her room." "In that case," said Van Dorn, raising his hat politely, and pre- paring to depart, "I suuppose I must leave without making the search," and he did. The lady of "Our General," wlo had been a listener from above, conling down as soon as Van- Dorn had disappeared, thanked the lady for the kind service. "There were ilany tings in my lpossesion,'" said she, " which lie would surely have taken. Besides lpapers, there were medals, sabres, and many other things, private property of mly husband, that I would not for anything he had taken away witl him." "I am delighted to lhave been able to serve you," said the lady. "My husband will appreciate your kindness, I am sure," said Mrs. Sidney, and the sequel showed that lie did. Everything of value was taken fromn the house, upon the evacua-   MSREPRESENTATIONS.         119 tion of Holly Springs; it was stripped of even its fine firniture, wlicll in boxes, addressed to Galena, was shipped away from 1-0olly Springs; Tho grateful man probably determined that he should have souvenirs with which to remind him of the service done him and his lady. Thus the fears of Charley and John proved well founded. Seven thousand five hundred men actually disorganized Sidney's entire armly of one hundred and fifty thousand. To Menphis the army fell back, and reorganized. Charley said one evening to John Prince: "I think that man occupies a most hulltpiliating position before the country, after having made such an ass of himself." "' Oh, by no means," said John; " on the contrary, his march to Aicksburg fizzle-not a fizzle either, for it hashcost thousands of lives, millions of treasure-but this mortifying failure has been made a most glorious afftir of. Our General' is lauded as a most prudent and keen-sighted soldier, full of strategy and all that sort of tling. You see, Charley,' the papers of the North ,lon't let anything tlatt sounds disparaging to the northern ear be chronicled." "Yes; but we are going now by transports, from Memphis to the vicinity-of Vicksburg," said C)iarley, arguing 4 "couldn't anybody see now that that was the way t4 go in the first piace?" "It seems so to you, and indeed to me also, I will admit," said John; "but if you were depending on the papers for all the informa- tion you were receiving, you would be apt to believe that that insane and criminal order to march overland to Vicksburg was one of the greatest master-pieces of generalship that had eter been executed." "It's lucky we didn't half of us starve down there with only one day's rations in the haversacks, and we, one hundred miles from i Memphis," said Charley. "Did you hear of that occurrence at Holly Springs, about Van Dorn and the General's wife?" asked John. "Yes ; all the men are talking about it," said Charley. "Did you ever know of such a shameless transaction?" "Even for Our General, " answered John, "it was shameful." "How in Heaven's name that man manages to retain his high position," said Charley, "is more than I can understand." "You know the quotation, Charley," said John: "'Some men are born great "- Fools," added Charley.    120          STOLEN GREATqESS. "Very true," said John; "but that isn't what old Shaky meant: 'Some are born great,'" he continued, " 'and onme achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.' I suppose you have your opinion as to which of the three classes s Our General' comes under." "No, I do not know anything of the kind," said Charley, emphati- cally. "I suppose you want me to consider him as having greatness thrust upon him, but it isn't. In that sentence should have been in- cluded, 'and some men steal greatness.'" "That, I guess, is included in the achievement of it," said John. "No," said Charley; "it is clear that there are meant those who honorably accomplish their fime, or power, or whatever else tile greatness consists of." "Well," said John, "never mind, we wont argue about that. We both agree well enough as to what kind of 'greatness' Our General,' lias." "I know that lie has a 'great' capacity for commissary," said Charley; " and I know that he has a 'great' hankering after property of one sort and another." "Yes," said John, " he has a good deal of some kinds of greatness." "It appears to me," said Charley, "as if some of his friends either own or influence a great many newspapers, where lie is puffed and blown all over the country as being the greatest fellow in the army, when really there are thousands of men in the ranks that wotld make better generals, and very few that would make worse. It surely means something." "I am told by Gen. C-- that he is in the hands of two or three politicians," said John, " who intend using him for their own pur- poses. Suppose this contest should cease now, calit you see how easy it would be to achieve anything almost by the use of a pliable fel- low like 'Our General,' possessing such a name among the people." "Do you really thinkl he is' in high favor among the people?" asked Charley. "I am positive of it," answered John; "the press, which has abso- lute control, of course, of the minds of the people, are with few excep- tions, colmpeing with each other in varnishing liil up into a pro- digious hero." "I can easily understand how they can make anything they choose out of' Our (General,' or atny such man," said Charley; "but I don't comprehend so clearly what their object can be?"   OBSTRUCTION TO HOME CORRESPONDENCE.      121 "Why, of course, to share the resulting benefits." Thus John and Charley discussed the topic for some time, until John was called away. Next day the troops went on board transpfots, and, in detachments, as rapidly as convenient, were transported to various points in the v icinity of Vicksburg. Charley's regiment was placed with others at Milliken's Bend, where "Our General" had established his head- quarters. For a long time Charley and Jqon both missed the cheering and pleasant letters from home. An order prohibiting letters from either leaving, or coming into camp, effectually deprived them of this con- nccting link between their army life and home. With the struggle before Vicksburg, ending in its surrender, the reader is doubtless faiiliar, or, even if not, will forgive the omission of what would be now its dry details. We will at once pass over the time occupied in the siege, and join our friends, John and Charley. bE   CHAPTER XI. A VISITOR FROM HOME. TIE remains of Charley's regiment were encamped on Black River. Charley was seated one day, writing a letter to Maggie Boulton, when, like a vision, the father of that girl appeared before him. After a hearty ald affectionate greeting was over, during the giving of which John Prince had entered the tent, Charley asked: "Why, how, in the name of goodness, did you get here?" "By boat and rail, horse power and pedestrianism," said Mr. Boulton. And then, more seriously, he related to Charley hIis coming to the camp, and there finding first, John Prince, who had taken him to the door of his (Charley's) tent, and left hm to enter by himself: "I almost believed it was your ghost," said Charley. "But sit down, and make yourself as comfortable as possible, and tell us how they all are at home. We have had no letters recently, you know." After the excitement consequent upon the meeting of our friends, Charley and John, and Mr. Boulton, had in some measure subsided, and the three had comfortably seated themselves in Col. Montgomery's quarters, Mr. Boulton opened the conversation by remarking: ' The absence of letters from you worried all of us very much." "It has seemed very strange to me, why your General found it necessary to stop all mail communication, for I knew that otherwise you would have written." "Oh, that is only in accordance with the man," said John; " it is one of Sidney's far-fetched plans, which nobody can see through but himself." "True, it does appear strange to me that such a measure should be taken; but certainly he must have confidence in the loyalty of men, who have braved deatih under him for mionths, in support of the very principles which this order is issued to defend," said Mr. Boulton. "Did you ever meet a man who was so deeply imbued in vil- lany and rascality as to preclude the possibility of his having con- fidence in any person, even of himself?" asked Charley. 122   SIDNEY'S PASI CONDUCT REVIEWED.       123 "Yes, I have seen such men. But it would be deplorable if your General be classed under tat head," said Mr. Boulton. "Unfortunately-he undoubtedly may be-I sincerely believe," said Charley. ( "And that is the conviction of every well-informed nan conhected with this army," said John Prince; "and how can we form any other, when we, who have increased opportunities, review his conduct for the past few months. For instance, look at that egregious and even criminal blunder in his original advance on this place, costing the Government millions of treasure, and the country many valuable lives; and which ended, as any man not wholly insane could have readily foreseen, in an utter failure to advance the Federal interest one jot, while it assisted and enriched our enemy. in an almost equal propor- tion to our enormous losses." Yes, that was a very painful mistake," said Mr. Boulton, "as far as I clan form an opinion from what I have read of it; but is there any truth in the report that General Sidney dissipates as heavily as le did previous to his leaving home?" He is much worse here," said John, emphatically; " at home he was occasionally sober, here I do no think it is an exaggeration to say that he has not drawn a single, eitirely calm, sober breath since lie came to us at Cairo." "Oh, surely you are putting that a little strong, John, said Mr. Boulton, appealingly; "you know the army under his command hlas been very successful, and has thus far won in every engagement; which could hardly be the case if guided by a brain benumbed with alcohol." "But he did not guide it," returned John, warmly; "I have occu- pied, during both of the past campaigns, a position which has given me an opportunity, far better than that possessed by many others, to see him often--more or less every day-and I do not hesitate to say that I have yet to see him for the first time perfectly sober. The reason why no more blunders have been made or worse mishaps be- falleni the army is that Sidney's assistants are, almost without excep- tion, men of ability. Some of them, considering the short time they have been in command, possess remarkable nilitary skill, and it is not an untruth to assert that every order which Ihas been issued over "Our General's" lhame, since the 15th of September, '61, was colm- posed, its workings planned, and its operations carried out, by thle mental powers of Sidney's commanders of corps, and staff officers.   124      "   OUR GENERAL'S"BLUNDERINGS. Now, instance your papers tlere at home; they gave Sildney grlat credit for the capture of Forts Henry and Donelson; it is a fict, known to every officer in this army, that every pllan which provedl of anry value, on being tested by actual working, was produced and op)e- rated by Sidney's division commanders; while every plan offered or suggested by Sidney himself was found, when eitler attack was made to be wholly useless. For example, every man who was in the fbile at the time will recollect that just before we left Fort Henry for Donel- son, one suggestion of our worthy General was, that it would be well to throw at least one brigade into the village of Dover, in order to prevent the enemy from using the river as a means of escape. Now the utter absurdity of this order was manifest when we arrived at the enemy's outworks, for we found that the village of Dover was inside qf the tenemy's third line of entrenchments. Now just consider the utter absurdity of that idea! Why it took our entire army three days to clear the way to it, and even then we only succeeded after the sur- render of the entire work. In fact, the Confederate commander evi- dently suplIosed it the strongest portion of his workls, as le used it during the last day's struggle as his headquarters. The last order issued by General Buckner was dated on that very spot. Yet "Our General" was going to occupy it on the first move. In addition to this, Sidney's failure on that point seemed to have such a stunning influence on him as to prevent him from observing a bluff on our -extreme right flank, and, of course, on the immediate bank of the river, where to have placed a single six-pound fieldpiece would have effectually prevented anythin g in the shape of a transport from passing; by tlis very oversight, he allowed Floyd to pass up on .Saturday night with 3500 men, a sleer loss of that number of prisoners and their arms. You may rely on this being a fair average of the actual mili- tary skill of this much-lauded hero of your press there at the North." "You surprise me greatly, indeed," said Mr. Boulton. "But I cannot understand, John, how it is possible for him to hold his position, and even advance in rank as he does, if this matter is understood at Washington." "y dear sir, if you will be kind enough to consider one thing, which you no doubt have not thought of," said John, "you will readily get an explanation of his astonishing success here in the army. When tshs d;iculty culminated in actual hostilities, the people of the North ' ere not a unit, by any means, in the opinion thiat Southern people wre doing a traitorous act, ih resorting to arms.   OBJECT OF THE WAR.         125 "There was, on the contrary, a large number of them opposed to what is termed coercion, and our people at Washington had to be very cautious what move they made for fear of producing a feeling tlat would be dangerous at the North, extending, in its ramifications, throughout every county, town, village, and, in fact, almost every fanmily north of Mason and Dixon's line. You probably know tlat Mr. L - n undoubtedly decided, even before the firing on Fort Sumpter occurred, that the primary cause of the trouble was slavery, and, quite as certainly, even at that early day, made up his mind to abolish it; but he dare not put the resolution into effect, knowing that the great mass of the people North would not endorse him in carrying out a bloody war, simply to abolisl slavery, and that to even hint that the war was for that soje and particular purpose would produce anarchy in every part of the country at once; he was obliged to await a more favorable time. In the meantime the country could be prepared for the step." "But do you think, Capt. Prince," said Mr. Boulton, "that the people of tlce North would have refised to support Mr. L----n, had he emancipated the negroes in '61?" "I not only think so," rejoined John, " but I have every reason to say I know it. I for one would not have volunteered under such a manifesto, and I do not think I am personally acquainted with a single man in the arm mfficer or private, wise or simple, who would. Why, look at the furore which Gen. Fremont created in Missouri in '61, by issuing a local order that all negroes who came inside of his individual lines should be protected from their former masters; officers resigned, and men deserted by the hundred, not only in the command of Gen. Fremont, but the disaffection spread throughout the army even to the forces on the Potomac. It was only by the most prompt and energetic measures taken by the Government, such as the immediate removal of Gen. Fremont from command, and piblishing far and wide the entire disapprobation of the administration in reference to this order, that they succeeded in counteracting its effects." ' But, John," said Mr. Boulton, "we were discussing your General; we have digressed. I cannot see what that has to do with Gen. Sidney." "Yes, but it has a great deal to do with him," said John, getting quite warm in his argument, "I'll soon explain how it has a great deal to do with him." He continued,- "As I said, Mr. L-- n understood, that even a majority of those    126      POIICY OF THE ADMNISTRATION. who wished heartily for the abolition of slavery would determinedly oppose the accomplishment of the purpose by a war with slave owners. He was, in consequence, obliged to wait until the popular sentiment was educated to a point which would enable him to issue such a manifesto safely, in pursuance of which object, it was necessary for him to hold Gcn. Geo. B. McC--n (probably the best General we have) in check, until 'Our General ' ]ad splurged around through a sufficient number of actions to furnish every town and hamlet in the North with a subject to mourn over in the shape of one of their members either dead or wounded, thereby creating such a feeling, and bringing the sentiments of the people of the North up to thAt point of desperation, that they would be willing to accept anything, so that the dreadful war might be ended. If Gen. McC-- n had been allowed to go on, he would have put an end to the troubles in a few months. Well, during this educational progrcss, unfortunately, our best man, McC---n, got the worst of it, he being so situated, and, beyon1 a doubt, possessing, not only the mental ability, but the disposition, to hlave enabled him, if properly supplied with men and munitions, to have ended this war at least one year ago; in consequence, it was policy to hold him back, which was done, and, as it was necessary, in order to satisfy the clamorous populace at home to blame somebody, for the protraction of the struggle, they blamed poor McC -n, and by holding him back, to continue the educational process fully as long as was necessary, and to clear themselves of the dissatisfaction that prevailed, they heaped the agony on little Mac at every opportunity until they, finally; killed him, or, what was nearly equivalent, so thoroughly embittered the minds of all, (except those who fought under him) as to necessitate his removal. It would not, as you can readily understand, answer to have all failures, and, although it was the policy of the Government to prevent the striking of any blow which would be likely to prove fatal to the rebellion, yet it was quite as necessary to make at the same time at least a show of success, which they could, and did, do by furnishing ample means and men at points where success could in no way be made final. Upon the consequent victories, resulting from these combinations, occurring in the natural course of events, it became equally the policy of the administration to have them lauded into triumphs with the lucky commander at the points selected, puffed into a hero, and for this reason we have H. Sidney for 'Our General,' with a fame attached that would honor a Napoleon, notwithstanding the undoubted fact   INABILITY OF "OUR GENERAL."        127 that he is an addle-brained sot. Our General' has by the sheer force of circumstances, and the good management of his corps com- manders and staff, and the heroic fighting qualities of his men, been manufactured into a first class modern hero." "Very well done, John, my boy," said Mr. Boulton, "very well done, and I regretfully believe there is only too much truth in your statement, but I hardly think that if your General had heard you, he would consider you a fair subject for promotion." "Probably not," returned John; "but if my promotion is to pro- ceed from minds like his, the less I have of it the better I shall relish it." "Perhaps you are right, Captain," said Mr. Boulton; "but is your General always as much at fault as he seems to have been at D onelson?" "Yes, indeed," said John, "and, in fact, is sometimes much worse; that is, his folly is sometimes productive of greater damage." "But he was your field commander at the battle of Shiloh or Pitts- burg Landing, and as that was undoubtedly one of the greatest field engagements in modern times, the man must have some ability or he would not have been able to bring you so safely through." And Mr, Boulton looked at John with the air of a man who has delivered a clincher. "You are mistaken when you say Sidney was our field commander at Shiloh,:' said John. "All honor derived from the success of our army on that bloody field is due to Maj.-Gen. John McC---d. When the fight commenced, Sidney was at Savannah, eleven miles down the river, and it was late in the day when he arrived on the ground; before which Gen. McC----d had rescued the army from its surprise, and had his lines firmly formed on ground which they did not afterwards leave during the fight, except to advance, and instead of possessing ability to save any army, when Sidney came off the boat at the landing, he was, as usual, too drunk to lave been able to form a single regiment, if left wholly to his own resources." "You certainly astonish me, " said Mr. Boulton. "A very different opinion of him is common. There is a great deal of talk about an affair that doesn't reflect a great deal of credit upon him though, that is said to have taken place at Holly Springs," said Mr. Boulton. "Charley, here, knows all about Holly Springs," said John. "Yes, sir," said Charley. "I was at Holly Springs during the attack of General Van Dorn, and afterward. I guess I know what   128            SURMSES. it is you mean by the rumor not reflecting credit on 'Our General.' I presume you allude to the nmatter concerning the reward of the lady who prevented the Holy General-as -the men call Van Dorn, who was previously to the war a ministeri' the gospel-from entering a room in which 'Our General's' lady 'as. It is true, and was a most disgraceful affair; " and Charley proceeded to give Mr. Boulton a full explanation of the incidents. ' I should cons/i er it," said Charley, "enough to damn any officer in the estimation of both hs men and his government. It was worse than cowardly, and ungrateful; in fact, to treat a positive enemy in 'the manner in which that lady was treated would be pronounced contrary to 'the rules governing warfare among civilized nations, to say nothing of chivalry, or the respect duc to the sex." "Well, even for the man with whomIn my little dealing led me to believe a bad manl," said Mr. Boulton, "this seems really incredible." "It is true, though," said Charley. - I am more astonished at the Governmlient countenancing such a man," said Mr. Boulton, " than I am at the conduct of the man himself. But probably they are deceived in hin. Probably they hear nothing but favorable reports. There was the first move on Vicksburg, for in- stance. How was the report of that movement taken at Waslington?" "Thlat is a difficult question for me to answer," said Chiarley; "to qay that such Ia series of miserable failures and blunders as have fol- lowed the track of 'Our- General' since he was commissioned is unnoticeable even at the distance of our national head-quarters, would be) to reflect oil the capacity of our leaders' there; or to assert that they, seeing them reftsced to apply the remedy, would be condermning their principles; neither of which would I think be justifiable, whch leav% us but the one solution of the problem: Sidney is the fortunate creature of favorable circumstances, the puppet in the hands of men who, in efforts to supply either the real or fancied needs of our country, lave in pursuance of tlat idea, or their workings for that end, incidentally elevated him to, his present position of power as ' Our General'; and in addition have, I am sincerely aftraid, in their manipulations of this species of concealed wire pulling, so placed Sidney, in conjunction with the excitable sympathy of the impulsive portion of our people home, as to create a positive danger of those people allowing the action of their impulses to carry him on to a position of still greater power, and, consequently, fraught with still greater danger to the country than if he remained in the one he now occupies."   DOLEFUL ANTICIPATIONS.         129 "No, no, Charles," said Mr. Boulton; " our American citizens are, I am willing to allow, an unusually nervous, excitable people; but notwithstanding this they have a fair share of plain common sense, and it will be only necessary to show them a sketch of your General in the miserable drunken, dissipated role that he filled to my own knowledge as a citizen, and that he continues to enact as a soldier. to yours, to effectually cure them of any desire they may have to com- mit such an absurd error as that." "You are, I atm positive, deceiving yourself, Mr. Boulton," said Charley; "so surely as anything should happen to remove our Chief Aagistrate before the war ends, or before lie can disband the armies and cool down the present military ardor and war spirit, settling our populace once more firmly in peaceful avocations; I say, so surely as this occurs, thleir first move will be to turn to their military com- imander, and transfbrm 'Our Gen'eral' into their civil leader, giving us one of the mostst striking illustrations of the blind leading the blind since tlme day Nero fired Rome. May God help our country if this occurs, fobr we then, indeed, will need His aid." "Well, Charles, my boy, althoughll you put it very strongly, per- haps you are right," said Mr. Boulton. "However, let us all earnestly hope you are not.  But to return to the General's present position; how (id Sidney manage after his abortive attempt on Vicksburg via "By a combination of blunders which, although not as serious in individual extent, were, taking them as a whole, a fair repetition of that one," saitl C lharley. "I will recite to you, fully, the whole afflir. Atter Sidney had despatlched a portion of his force to the immediate vicillity of Vicksburg, and h1ad fully satisfied himself by this experi- Iment -that his divibsion connmmanders possessedt sufficient judgment and ability to prevent the enemy from leaving their works and capturing his entire command, himself included, Sidney ventured to go himself, and then commenced a series of blunders unequalled in the history of war. Abortive trials at this point, futile attempts at that, desperate and murderous assaults at another, a frantic expedition sent up this pass, an absurd attempt made via that bayou; long, tedious and hloody marches to gain a view  of the position from this side, only to fall back and retreat to secure a view ftom another side; every move,       t each march, with Its attendant skirmishes, costing the Government       * millions of money, and the apparently doomed army hundreds of brave . honest hearts. Thus we wore away the long, weary winter, and  9    130      ABORTIVE ATTEMPT ON VICKSBURG. dragged through the, to us, cheerless spring, with nothing accom- plished, notwithstanding the scores of millions in money, and many months of valuable time spotted with the- blood of a host of heroes, we found ourselves past the middle of the last spring month, without having gained the first advantage, or one inch toward the capture of Vicksburg.' All through these long months 'Our General' had kept his extensive naval fleet busy throwing shells night and (day, costing the Government at the rate of thirty dollars for each shell, and the benefit amounting to about what glass beads would have done had they been thrown instead of iron shells." On Mr. Boulton's face was plainly marked an expression of great astonishment. "But I should think such a continued series of failures would have so completely discouraged the men as to have created a mutiny," said he to Charley. "The enlisted men in our army," explained Charley, " occupy such a position that in extensive movements, such as .these were, it is very difficult for them to see or determnine just at the actual result of any particular move was, and this fact was seized and used by the officers-who were hoping, and hoping against reason, that all would come right in the end-to quiet them, and, with one or two trivial excelptions, they were successful. "Dragging along in. this way," Charley continued, " until the 22d of May, there tlen transpired an occurrence which for cold-blooded,  murderous scoundrelism, in carrying out a scheme of 'heartless vil- lany, has not a parallel in the annals of civilization." Charley's whole manner, as he spoke, betokened strong excitement, and soon Mr. Boul- ton shared it. "You recollect, I suppose, that when Sidney was com- missioned a Brigadier-General there was quite a number of the same rank created on the same day. Well, among them, was J. M. McC--d, of Illinois, who was ordered to report for duty with his command at Cairo. On arriving atthat point, he found no one who exceeded him in rank, and refused to receive orders from Sidney, who. had assumed command of the post. This being referred to the Com- manding officer of the Department, whose headquarters were at St. Louis, and he not being able to decide it, as there was no clause in the 'Army Regulations'giving any instructions on that point; he telegraphed to Washington for orders. INow, probably, among the most influential advisers of the President was a townsman of Sid* ney's, who, of owrse, advised the plseing of Sidney in command, which you know was done. This,. for the time, settled the diliculty.   HEARTLESS VILLANY.          131 c;ill. McC-- d had rather indignantly resisted the assumption of Sidney, however, until that officer was placed in command, and Sid- iley never forgot it. His wounded pride was continually reminding him of it, and the daily evidences of the superior capacity possessed by Gen. AMC---d deepened his hatred, and notwithstanding he knew tlat the most prominent successes gained by our Western army thus far were in a great measure attributable to the ability of Gen. Mc- C --d, Sidney resolved to ruin him, and, after several ineffectual aIttc: I is to (do it, he issued orders for the famous charge in which the Thirteenth Corps so eminently distinguished themselves.  "On the 22d of May, on that fltal morning, I drew my regiment up in line, 980 strong, composed of'as brave hearts as ever followed a stand of' colors. A few minutes before ten, the clear notes of the bugle rang out a warning to be ready, an at ten, the hour appointed, we moved forward in a column of platoons. In order that the fiendish plan milght be the more sure to succeed, the general orders compelled our corps to cover such an extent of fiont as to oblige our commander to place his entire force on the line, leaving him no reserve to repel a soltie, or reinforce a weak point; but, notwithstanding this, there was no alternative. 'Obey orders,' is the brave soldier's ten command- ments concentrated into one, and the lion-hearted McC--dd led us forward. In a short time we had scaled the first natural parapet in our front, and there lay the grey quarry grimly biding his time, and like a crouched lion awaiting us. What a sight was that to make a weak man falter, and a brave man halt and think. Full one-third of a mile to traverse, and no spot in all withdrawn from the enemy's sight; not a foot of ground that could not be played upon by the enemy's cannon. The base attained, what then! A heavy earth- work packed with the enemy. The work carried, and what then? A hill rising abruptly two hundred feet, rained on by bullets, swept by shot and shell; another valley, then up again; another storm of fire and iron, and then the crest, and then the enemy. To dream of such an undertaking was madness, to plan it sheer folly, to perform it was simply impossible." Charley had grown most solemnly earnest, and Mr. Boulton, and even John, listened with bated breath, and Charley continued: "A minute, and the skirmishers deploy; another minute, and the first great drops begin to patter; still another minute, and the musketry is in full play along the line; men fall fast and thickly here and there, and the line begins to look ragged, as the wounded drop out o the,   132         A DREADFUL CHARGE. rear; the wind lifts the smoke for an instant, and every thing appears distinct. "The 1st, 2d, and 3d brigades are wading their full depth in death; we push 'on, leaving nothing behind us, there is no reserve in this fight, all are doomed. At our right, to our left, and in our front, the bright steel of the enemy glitters, and then comes a crash followed 1) a tempest of tons of the iron rain on the doomed heads. Still wo struggled on, though the sides of the hill were slippery with blood. Sheets of flame baptize us, and plunging shot tear away comrades on left and right of us; stumbling over the dead and wounded, or Strug- gling with the living, faicilg the steady fire of six thousand inflatry, poured down upon our heads as if it were the old historic curse froml heaven, we struggled and wrestled for the summit. It is no longer shoulder to shoulder, it is God for us all. Fifteen, twenty minutte go by like a reluctant century, and still the hill sways up before us at an angle of forty-five degrees; and still our brave, lion-learted Western men are clambering steadily on, up, upward still. The iron sledges beat on. Hearts loyal and brave are on the anvil. Things are getting desperate up aloft, the enemy light the fuses of shell and roll them down the steep; but it would not all do, and just as the sun reaclled the meridian our line surged over the crest, our flags fluttered along the parapet, and the first line of works was ours, and, with 'a God bless our colors,' 'God save our country,' we flung ourselves exhausted on the ground from which we were soon aroused by the reassuring voice of the noble-hearted McC--- d, who, with his bronzed cheeks wet with tears as honest as the blood that redcldened our route, .aiId, 'Men, I am proud of you, every manl; you have added a bright page to your country's history by this morning's work, but we are not done yet. I am waiting for reintfrcements, which have been promised us by "Our General," and when they arrive, be ready. You will, perhaps, have a half hour's rest.' "Well, we waited. One, two, three, four o'clock came, and still no reinforcements, while the lines of anxiety which the face of the gtl- lant McC  -d had worn all day, deepened, and by five we could plainly perceive by his conduct that he was contending with sonle- thing besides the conmmon enemy; soon after, we received the or(ciT to fall back, and another half hour placed us out of the range of the enemies' guns. I reformed my line, and found that out of 980 who had followed me into the fight eight hours before, I had 538 left, leaving 442 to fatten the harvest of death; and with what result?   CRIMNAL REVENGE.           133 only the satisfaction of thinking that I and my men had been made tools of, and the thousands of brave, true-hearted fellows had found death to satisfy a criminal revenge, and to further an effort to place one of the ablest men in the army on the shelf, which attempt was unfortunately successful."  / "But, great heaven! Charles, an it he possible that human nature can be rendered so brutally ferocious, under any circumstances, as to be guilty of deliberately and in cold blood giving an order, the action of which will consign even one of his brothers in arms to death, for the gratification of a hellish passion for individual re- venge?" askeld Mr. Boulton, with horror in his face. "If I was certain that Sidney had done that, I would feel tempted to borrow a carbine from one of your men, and go and shoot the miserable, drunken scoundrel on sight." "I have simply given you the facts, Mr. Boulton," said Charley, "and you can form your own conclusions.  After the return from tile unsuccessful assault, the officers on Sidney's staff, headed by O'Haller, busied themselves in spreading through camp all sorts of foundationless rumors, to the effect that McC -- d llad no orders to make the charge, and tlhat the entire action was brought on by his carelessness and precipitate conduct. It was, doubtless, expected by this means, to embitter the minds of the enlisted men against Gen. MtC--  d, who had previously been a great favorite with all of them. Following up this conduct until the first week in June, Sidney fur- nished the sequel his tragedy by relieving McC-- from com- mand, and ordering lbhl out of the lines. We continued tgl siege, until the garrison at Vicksburg, being com- pletely worn out and destitute of supplies, were obliged to surrender, which occurred, as you are probably aware, on the fourth of this month. I was then ordered into camp here, where we have been restincg since." "You lhave filled me with the strongest feelings of indignation against your General," said Mr. Boulton, " and the feeling is by no means an enjoyable one. Let us talk of home and of those who are there." !"I would much rather go and see them," said John Prince. "I was not without hope that I would have both of you back with me," said Mr. Boulton. "And the girls, together with your mothers, are sure you will be back with me." "They will not be disappointed either," said John. "Charley, you   134         A DREADED MEETING. can get leave for us to-morrow. Mr. Boulton can enjoy a soldier's couch for one night, and to-morrow we will start with him." "Yes, I believe this is as good a time as we could choose to go home for awhile," said Charley. "In fact," said lie to Mr. Boulton, "John and I have for somie days been contenmplating a visit." Mr. Boulton was nmuch pleased with the prospect of having the two friends home with him.      a John left the tent, and Mr. Boulton said, anxiously, to Charley, as soon as he was alone, "Charles, have you been able to learn any tidings of your ftlher?" 9'None, sir," answered Charley, wlile a shade of pain crossed his face. "I fear, day by day, that lmeeting whcth I a1 sure will comne." And the young mlan coveredl his fhce with his hands. "God grant that you will not meet as enemnies, face to face," said Mr. Boulton, fervently. And seeing that it was a inost painful topio to Charley Montgomery, he changed the subject.  Soon, John Prince returilel, and after sDending a long while in a conversation that was niost gratefully pleasant to the two soldiers,' preparations were made for the retiring for the night. It was deeided that Mr. Boulton should Hellain with Chlarley; and John, after bidding them good night, left ftr his own quarters. In the morning Mr. Boulton declared that he had spent a very comfortable niglt, aIn lhadl slept soundly. Awaiting the arrival of John Prince, Mr. Bolllton sat readingl a paper, while Charley left to secure the much covetexd prizes-tlhe leaves of absence. q   CHAPTER   XII. HOME, SWEET IOME. CHARLEY made application foio the leaves of absence; but, to his ektreme disappointment, "Our General" refused the application. When Charley returned and communicated the result of his endeavors, John and Mr. Boulton were sharers in his feelings. "What can possibly be tie reason of it?" asked Mr. Boulton. "The assigned reason," said Charley, rousing from his dejectedness, "is that it would be unadvisable to grant officers an extended leave, just at this time; but I know that they have'been leaving daily." "Iie should know best," sail Mr. Boulton, trying to console them in some way in their deep disappointnient. "I e should know best, and lie does know best," said John Prince. "I know, too, that there is nothing but that malicious man's whim, to prevent us from going home. Why, I'll wager that leaves will be given by the dozel before this day's over," ' I suppose there is no help for it," said Charley, again giving up to the despondent feelings that had possessed him from the time he was refused. Mr. Boulton was to take his departure that afternoon. He promised that he would assure them at home, that all efforts that could be made were put forth to secure the permission to go home; messages enough to freight a mail bag were given from the two young soldiers, to be carried in all affection to the tenderly remnembered ones at home. The time passed on, and Mr. Boulton took his leave of the sorrowful friends after they had acconpanied him quite a distance. That night before the "Tattoo " beat, Mr. Boulton again made his appearance in Charley's tent. John was speedily brought over, and Mr. Boulton in answer to their looks of surprise explained that it was impossible for him to go up the river, as the Government had taken possession of all the passenger boats for use in transporting the troops. "And, as I couldn't get away," said Mr. Boulton," I thought I would spend the night with my friends." And a pleasant night he did spend. 135   136       LEAVE OF ABSENCE OBTAINED. He was to leave the following evening, as he had been informed there would be a boat then, in which he could get a passage to Cairo. As the day wore away the young friends became more and more anxious to go home with Mr'. Boulton. Charley said that if it was anybody else, he'd make another application. Towards noon of the day following, Col. B--- came into Charley's tent. "Did you hear that 'Our General ' is going on a visit to Memphis?" queried Col. B--. No, I did not," said John, to whom he had addressed the inter- rogatory. "When does he go?" I shouldn't wonder if le's off now," returned Col. B- . "Gen. ---- of llis staff told me albout it a few minutes ago." "Well, I'm glad of it," said Charley. "Dear knows, I wish he'd stay away altogether. By the way, wlho's in command,-Sherman?" "Yes," said Col. B -. All right," said Charley, as gleefully as a boy might say it, upon being told that vacation had come. I thought you might feel interested," said Col. B1- , significantly. "You'll be likely to be more successfiul with Old Tecumseh, than you were with Sidney about those Leaves.' " "Why, you didn't hear about the refusal, did you?" asked John, in some surprise. "Oh, yes! didn't I, though," responded Col. B . "If Sidney had been perfectly sober, he would not, perhaps, have bragged that you should never get home." An indignant red flushed the faces of both John and Charley. "Say nothing labot it, it is the wisest plan," said Col. B-. Go up to Sherman ; ie will grant you a leave, I am sure. But above all, don't say anythingl about my telling you that Sidney was boasting at his headquarters that he had refused you your leaves." And Col. B-   left the tent. "I'll fix those leaves in a short time now," said Charley. ",Yon remain here, Mr. Boulton, I will uot b)e gone long, and when I come back I guess John and I will get ready to go on with you." And Charley, in the best of spirits, left the tent to seek the headquarters of "Old Tccumseh." True elnoughl, Clharley had with him, when he returned, the necces- sary papers on whose permission he and John were to visit that much loved place,and those still more loved dear ones whom they had left there. 't   PROVIDENCE V8. CHANCE.         137 Charley had also brought with him a pass for Frank Blackwoodc "He will enjoy the trip, I know," said the solicitous Chariley. "He has no body to visit of his own, and the poor fellow gets few or no letters. I am positive he will be delighted with the girls, and with our mothers." "' He certainly deserves it, too, from us, for he has been our faithfut friend," said John. Frank was delighted, indeed, when he was told he was to accompany the party home. "Did you ever know of anything so lucky as the return to camp of Mr. Boulton?" said Jolhn to Charley, as they were busying themselves getting ready to go with that gentleman on his return trip. "It was certainly very fortunate," said Charley; " if fortunate is the right kind of a word there." ' It is not, Charles," said Mr. Boulton, who was sitting within hearing; "I firmly believe that Providence directs such things." "Yes, and I believe so, too," said Charley, more solemnly than he had been talking for some time previously. "I also believe that to Providence is due the thanks for much that is ascribed to chanllce," said Johnl; " and to Him I give the thanks for this opportunity to visit my mother and sisters." "Amen!'" came heartily from Cllarley. Soon they were on their way, and beforo long were on the boat going up the Mississippi. At Cairo, tlhey got on board the train, and fast as the train went the anxious lhearts of John and Chalrley went before it to the place that they were so anxious to reach. Jolln Prince and Frank Blackwood had " paired off" in the car, and Mr. Boulton and Charley had also taken a seat side by side. Soon the conversa- tion turned on the mine, and how it was beilg operated. "It has been a nine indeed, Cliarles," said Mr. Boulton; "a mine of wealth to me, and I feel I owe it all to you." Charley felt rather uncomfortalle than otherwise. "I have been blessed with an abundance, Charles, and it is, indi- rectly at least, to you that I am indebted. I would like-in fact, I will not feel satisfied until you have been compensated in a suitable mall el'." "Indeed, Mr. Boulton," said Charley, "you need not mention it;  and the recollection of Margaret Boulton's remarks about the same subject flashed u)pon him. Oh,?es, but I need," said Mr. Boulton. "In justice to yourself   138          A DECLARATION. Charles, you should look honestly at this question. I owe to you nearly all my present wealth, which is great, and is rapidly becoming greater. Now, should you not in simple justice' be benefited propor-, tionally?" Charley mused for a little while, and then said: Mr. Boulton, I had no intention of saying what I'm about to say; but your kindness encourages me. I have felt towards your daughter, Margaret"- Mr. Boulton saw Charley's embarrassment, and said: "I under- stand, Charles; you need not be backward in saying just whAt you feel on that subject." 'I have always, from the first'time I ever saw your daughter," said Charley, greatly encouraged, " felt that she interested me in no ordinary way. And the last time I was home, sir, I am sure that I saw in her sufficient to make me believe that she at least respects mle, and-and-"   And Charley was again confused, fearing that he had been rather forward. "Have no hesitancy whatever," said Mr. Boulton, observing Charley's situation; "speak freely, atnd when you have finished, I will reply to you; and I guess I will- be able to add still more to your anticipation of pleasure in your visit home, as we call the place now, although neither of us has any particular reason to dignify it with that name." Charley scarcely paid any attention to Mr. Boulton's opinion as to how much reason there mighlt or might not be to call the place they were going to, lhome; but turned over in his anxious mind whalt Mr. Boulton might mean by addling to his pleasurallle anticipations. But much as he tried, Charley could not again begin the conversa- tion; so Mr. Boulton said: "Charles, my soni-for I feel you my son as much as I coull if I were really your father." "Oh, thank you," said Charley, gratefully. Not at all," said Mr. Boulton; " rather thank your own goodness of disposition, your own keen sense of honor, and your own high principles." Charley, although quite pleased, was, nevertheless, as much in a quandary as to what to say, as though he were being told that the Queen of England had suddenly died, and ie was himself to succeed her on the throne. Mr. Boulton noticed this, and said : "I see you do not exactly understand what I mean. I will tell you as briefly as I can. I, of course, could not be blind to your attachment for my daughter, Margaret. I very soon saw it, and was myself pleased with   ITS RECErPION.       -   39 it. I was not sure, however, of what Margaret's feelings toward you might be, only that she had a high regard for you." Mr; Boulton affected not to be aware that Charley was nearly on fire, from the red that his words were causing to appear on Charley's face. He continued: "I could conceive of nothing that 'would afford me more real pleasure than to see an attachment spring up which would end in your marrying each other; for," said Mr. Boul- ion, affectionately, "I knew there was no service that could be per- formed, that the gift of my daughter's hand would not repay." Charley could nott gt a single word to flow fron the end of his tongue. But sle was not mine to give," said Mr. Boulton, seriously. "In a matter of that kitnd it was always my determination to let her choose for herself. I could never influence her, or rather I would not, by even a word. But, as it was of the utmost importance to me, I watched the increasing warmthl of' her letters to you. She always read them to me before sending them to you. 1 could detect the rapidly developing affection, and )egan' to question lier, in a way she could not su1spect, and before I came away, I learned from her that she would marry you, if you would ask her. You see I have actually proposed lor you, and have be(en accepted." Charley could not believe his own ears. He relied upon them sufficiently, however to make hii grasp Mr.,Boulton's hand and press it, while he got out, "'0 Mr. Boulton, how can I ever thank you enough for this?" "By making Margaret a good husband, as I'm sure you will," an- swered Mr. Boultotl. "Take care," lie continued, "we will attract attention if you don't mind." And if they had not been oc6upying the seat furthest back in 'the car, they would have been .most likely to have been favored with a great deal of attention. Many would witliout a doubt have thought that Mr. Boulton was bringing Charley on to be hanged, and that having changed his mind he had handed Charley the death-warrant, that he might tear t up; and that Charley having torn it up into very small pieces, was enjoying an inspection of the scraps, and trying to thank his liberator at the same time. The rest of the trip Was, to Charley at least, short, but not by ten thousand miles, he thought, short enough. When they got off the train they proceeded to the house of Mr. Boulton instead of going to Prince's. .It was just about sunset when   "O            EXPECrANCY. they arrived. Going upstairs, they took a refreshing bath, and changed their clothes. "Margaret is at your house, Mr. Prince," said Mr. Boulton; "she has been there since I left, I know very well, for some sewing I see on her table here is just the same, as near as I can recollect, as when I left it; which would not be the case if she had spent much time here in her room." "I hope she has, sir," replied Jolin; "it made it all the more pleasant for my mother and sisters." "I am going over there now," said Mr. Boulton. "I wish to pre- -are them a little, you know. You, gentlemen, will take your sup- pers, which is all ready down-stairs, and when you have finished, you can come over after me. You will find Joseph with a carriage await- ing you at the door. Now lon't let your impatience to get over after me spoil your appetites, I certainly wont expect you in less tlhal an hour."                ' Mr. Boulton went out, and mounting a very fine horse, rode off in the direction of Prince's. Arriving tlere he knocked, and Lena, who appeared to take it as her special privilege-so she regarded it- to respond to all knocks, appeared at the door. She had grown, remarkably, since we left her. She was now quite tall, tall as Carrie. And in her face was all the sweetness of expression of her sisters. Mr. Boulton kissed her and went in. The family were at tea. Maggie flew to him, and kissed him repeatedly, which he repaid by giving her a good hugging. Then Mr. Boulton shook hands with Mrs, Prince and Mrs. Montgomery, and was gallant enough to kiss the rest of the girls. Mrs. Prince and Mrs. Montgomery both, in one breath, ex- claimed: "But where are the boys?" "What boys?" asked Mr. Boulton, innocently. "John," said Mrs. Prince, while Mrs. Montgomery answered, "Charley."  "Oh," said Mr. Boulton, "they are nice boys. You ought to see them, and then call them boys. Boys, indeed!" The girls were also very deeply interested asfto the whereabouts of the " boys." "I know papa is trying to keep some good news back," said Mag- gie, "' for he looks as if he were dying to tell us something." "And I'm sure we are dying to hear it," said Susie Montgomery. "Yes, I've a great deal to tell you," said Mr. Boulton, trying his best to look unconcernedly at all the anxions faces in turn. "Your   A HOME RECEPTION.          141 sone are each well," said he, turning to Mrs. Prince, and then to Mrs. Montgomery. "Yes, but they will get home, wont they?" said Mrs. Prince. "Oh, yes, I hope so," said XMr. Boulton. "They did apply for a leave the day I started for home, but the leave was not granted." Every countenance fell; Mr. Bolton observing that the effect of his remark was painful, hurriedly went on: "They, however, were more successful the following day, and obtained a leave not only for them- selves, but for a young gentleman named Licut. Frank Blackwood." "I have very often seen his name in John's letter," said M/rs. Prince, "and Joln always spoke very well of him; but," said she, hastening back to a subject that had more interest for her, "you have not told us when we mighlt expect the boys. To-nigh't?" and Mrs. Prince awaited his answer with a painful suspense. I wouldn't be surprised if they did get here to-night," said Mr. Boulton. At that very moment a carriage rolled up to the door. There was a rush on the part of all hands, but Mr. Boulton, to the front door. As it swung open, John Prince was jumping down, and Mrs. Prince, with a cry that John knew well, ran out, and throwing her arms around him almost fainted upon him. Mrs. Montgomery had been counterparting Mrs. Prince's actions, only Charley was the object of her affectionate embrace. As soon as the mothers could be pre- vailed upon to give the yotung ladies a chance, John and Charley re- ceived fromn tihem a most hearty and affectionate reception. After it lad been pretty wall gone through with, John Prince exclaimed: "Oh, excuse me, Frank    - , mF y mother and my sisters," and in spite of Frank's urgent, "Oh, don't mind me," John brought Frank to each one in the room, and introduced him to them one by one. Frank lihl a suspicious redness around his eyes, which indicated that he had been enjoying the scene of the meeting in his own peculiar way. Rose Prince first thought that the travellers would need some supper; but Mr. Boutton explained that they had had supper at his house; "that is, if they ate it," said Mr. Boulton. They declared that they had eaten as much as they could. "I will let Mr. Blackwood answer for them," said Mrs. Prince. Frank thus appealed to said, that as soon as Mr. Boulton closed the door, they had posted him at a side window to see when Mr. Boul- ton got out of sight, and that as soon as he (Frank) had reported Mr. Boulton gone, they jumped up from the table, where they had .been:,   "2        A STROLL BY MOONLIGHT. sitting without touching a mouthful, awaiting the announcement that Mr. Boulton was out of siglt. He was interrupted by both Charley and John with an occasional," Now, Frank," "Oh," "How can you? 2 and like remarks; but Frank kept on- until he had given them the full account, and tlhen he tturned to John and Charley, and said lie was determined that as it vas left to him to give a full report, he'd give it. Mrs. Prince said she'd get some ready anyhow, and she (id. It was surprising how capitally the four of them, Charley, Mr. Boul- ton, who it will be reriembleredl, had none at all, Frank an(d John, manlaged to clear away the viandls as they wer'e blrought. For those wlho had just gotten 1u froi'lb olne supper-table, tliree of the party did, very well. After supper, as it was a delightfiul moonlight nighlt, Charley proposed a walk to get the air, he said, but at least one of the party knexw that in prop)osing a walk, he was only getting him- self an opportunity for another kind of' proposal. "Suppose you sing something for us before you take the walk," said Carrie Prince. "I could sing better after I come back, I think," returned Charley, with an expression of satisfaction in his voice, that none but Mr. Boulton and hi lself understood. "No, but that wont do," said Carrie; and in her opinion that it wouldn't do she was joined by the others. So Charley seating him- self before the piano sung, while lie played for himself a very pretty accompaniment: "Home, Sweet Horne." His own voice was tremu- lous with emotion in many parts of the song, and often and often it thrilled every heart in the room. After it had been sung, not a voice uttered a syllable for filly a minute, each one busy with thoughts called up by the song. Charley was the first to break the silence. "I didn't want to make you all so blue by singing the song," he said. "Why you all look as if you are going to a funeral." Gradually thlty recovered fron the effect of the song, and Charley again suggested a stroll. This time with more success. The walk was agreed to. By accident, of course, Charley and Maggie Boultoa were the first couple to form, Then came John Prince and Susie Montgomery. Frank Blackwood appeared to take an especial interest in Carrie Prince, and having asked her to accompany him in the walk, she accepted, and. they formed the third couple, while Rose and Lena Prince made the last, Mr. Boulton declaring that he would stay and protect Mrs. Prinoe and Mrs. Montgomery, who were remaining at home,   POPPING TIE QUWrTION.         143 Leaving the reader (if a male) to escort Rose and Lena, with the assurance that he'll find his task a pleasant one, we must eavesdrop a little on Charley and Maggie Boulton. They were separated from the- rest enough to keep the others' from overhearing their conversation, which was carried on in a low tone. "I have been bold enough to believe, Miss Maggie," said Charley, "that you entertain for me an esteem not altogether founded upon my service, as you are kind enough to ternl it, for your father." "I certainly do esteem you, Mr. Montgomery," said Maggie, and even in the pale moonlight Charley could see that Lena's cause for renark, that carnation tint, was still a " failing " of Maggie Boulton's; and one of the most beautiful failings, he thought, that he had ever seen.  "I know that, Miss Maggie," said Charley, " and I am very deeply gratefil for it, but it is not to cease with a mere friendly esteem, I hop)e." And the roguish fellow paused, just the same as if it were an old style proposal he was making, and he with the assurance from her father that it woul( be all right. But in spite of this assurance, Charley felt himself to be performing a most so emn and serious, although a pleasant task. Of course, Maggie didn't know just precisely what he meant. No girl ever did, probably, without a most thorough and ex- plicit explanation. And Charley, unlike a great many other gentle- men-at least those of whom the popular ideal exists-lost no time in getting Maggie to comprehend what he meant. We can reasonably suppose that the old gentleman, Maggie's father, had not deceived him, for Charley would never have worn the expression he did under any other circumstances. The other couples appeared, also, to have enjoyed the walk very well. When they returned to the house Mr. Boulton was yet engaged in relating to the ladies at home some of the scenes he had witnessed at camp. There was another gentleman in the parlor, whom neither John nor Charley had ever seen. "He was a very moral looking felb low," as Frank Blackwood whispered to Carrie Prince. He sat very upright on a sofa, and his hands were clasped and lying on hisknees. He was dressed in a full suit of black clothes, ad his vest came up very higl to the neck, just showing a little whittrip of linen around. his throat, that looked like a string tied aroun a black jar. Mr. Clegg, our new minister," said Mrsturi  i n a eff  to  get John to stop staring at the man,   "4         REV. SAMUL CLEO. "How do you do, sir. I hope you are well," said John, acknowr ledging the introduction which was then given to Charley Montgomery and to Frank Blackwood. "I am enjoying very fair physical health," said Mr. Clegg, in a very slow, deliberate manner, and with a voice that reminded John of a funeral dirge. "But the spiritual health is the more important, -sir, which of course you air awair of." Before the man was lialf through, John had conceived a strong dis- 'like for Rev. Mr. Samuel Clegg. There was a twangy sanctimonious- ness about the man, and a sneaky, oily manner that John did not like. John's mother noticed the exlression of dislike immediately, and was ,on the point of making some remark to call John's attention, when John commenced to answer Mr. Clegg. "We don't get much ohance to look after any kind of' health down where we are," said John. "You surely read the blessed Word," said Rev. Clegg, witl a look of horror on his face, which lie lhad placed there to be prepared1 for an answer in the negative. The answer came, and it was in the negative. The holy man was shocked. He appealed to Mr. Boulton and to the ladies in turn, with quite an eXtended comment upon the misery likely to ensue from the neglect to read the blessed Book. "We would be the better, I am sure," said John Prince, with ill- concealed disgust, " to read the Bible carefully, and practise its pre- cepts whether at home or in the field." And then, in response to a question as to how many men, on an average, in each company, took the proper kind of care of their spiritual health, John answered: Well, that's an examination that I never imade, but as far as my recollection goes, basedl ulpon casual observation, I should say there are about three men in a company that 'drink in the refreshing draughts from the fountain of life,' as you say." This information seemed to cause the reverend gentleman the most poignant grief. le groaned and swayed to and fro, until Mrs. Prince arose :and going away presently returned witl a tumbler in which was something that looked like, and, John thought, as it passed him, smelled like commissary of the finer brand. "Is this Jamaica r- ginger?" asked the exemplary man, as he went with outstretched hand eagerly for the glass. "No, there's no Jamaica ginger in the house, Mr. Clegg," replied Mrs. Prince. As nothing else was in the house suitable for his affeo;   A CLERICAL HYOCRITE.         145 tion, the reverend gentleman swallowed what was in the tumbler, and looked holier than ever. "Why, I thought that your General," said Mr. Clegg, "had issued an order that a chapter in the Bible should be read in the army every day." A visible smile overspread the countenances of John, Charley and Frank, aJhfon replied that he hadn't heard of it. "It is so reported at my church," said Rev. Clegg; "and as the father of your General goes to the church, I thought it was surely so. A very pious old gentlenman, that father of your General, sir." "Yes, I should think from the son, that the father must be a very pious old man. 'Like father like son,' is a very ancient adage." "I am glad to see that you are acquainted with at least some por- tion of your Bible," said Rev. Mr. Clegg, looking pleased. "Which part, sir?" asked John, in amazement. "Why, you just quoted a passage from-from--eh!" and the Rev- erend Clegg was threatened with another Jamaica ginger attack, which was no doubt prevented by John saying, "I guess that's from the Franklin Almanac."  And the whole party laughed in spite of themselves. I suppose you pray for your General's health and success," said Mr. Clegg, addressing himself to Charley. 1 understand he is very much liked, almost adored, in fict, by his men;" and after rolling his eyes a little, and groaning just once, Rev.( Clegg expressed the opinion that the good feeling of the men towardl General Sidney was a reward for the strictly moral life that immaculate man was known to lead. Of course the three soldiers were as much amused .with the tev. visitor, as they were moved to contempt for him. "Where has Mr. Miller gone, mother?" said John, unable to wait until Clegg had gone. "He is weary and worn with his labors," said holy Clegg, break- ing in ahead of Mrs. Prince. "Brother Miller has borne the heat / and the labor; he has fought the good fight." "He is not dead, surely, mother!" said John, turning with con- tempt from Clegg. "No, John, he is not dead," answered Mrs. Prince. "But he is very feeble, and unable to perform the services at the church. Mr. Clegg was sent some months ago." "Just four months and two weeks, the day before yesterday," inter- rupted Mr. Clegg. "I remember as if it had been but a month 1rrI. 10   "6       CLEGG S, CIIARAC'ITE DISCUSSED. Miss Rose, here, I met on the road, and I thought-eh-that--eh--" And the Rev. Mr. Clegg caught the glance of the eye that John had fixed upon him, and whatever else he might have had to say was lost on the company. He soon left, much to the relief of every body. John commented freely upon hm. "He to succeed Mrr. Miller! He wasn't fit to loose the latchet of Mr. Miller's shoes," etc. John also inquired what he was going to say about having met Rose. tose colored deeply, and, indeed, almost cried, when Carrie laughed out; "Oh, he's in love with Rose." John made some remarks about doing Rose's courting with Mr. Clegg. When the three friends got together before going to bed, they had a very amusing time with the discussion of- the Rev. Clegg. "That groaning dodge is pretty slarp, isn't it?"! asked Frank Blackwood. "Yes, and even that isn't original," said Charley. "The man ha.3 been reading the ' Pickwick Papers,' and le's coming that game that Deacon Stebbins used to play uD at oldl Weller's. H-e reminded me very much all the time of Dickens' Stebbins." "So he did me," said both John and Frank, in a breath; "and I believe there is a good deal of Stebbins in lim, too," said John. "But I guess I can fix Cleggy." Frank and Charley roomed together, and it kept running in Charley's mind that there was something he had forgotten. At last as he was undressing himself it occurred to him. he had not kissed Lena good-night. Nor was that all of it. She had changed so, and seemed to be getting so big and lady-like that he was afraid to ven- ture upon a trial. So lie lay down, and after thinking for a long time over it fell asleep. Frank Blackwood had been asleep almost before his head reached the pillow. The next day Charley went over to the mine with Mr. Boulton, and there he met "Wully" and Jem Ovens. They were delighted to see Charley, and he was pleased to see tlem. After leaving the mine, Charley drove with Mr. Boulton over to the house of the latter. A fine house it was, too, which Mr. Boulton had had erected for himn- self, on one of the fipest sites in the town. On the way over Charley told Mr. Boulton that on the night before, he had during the walk asked Maggie, and that Maggie would marry him at any time. Mr. Boulton was of the opinion that no time should be lost. There were one or two reasons which he would not mention to Charley. So it was arranged that in about two weeks the marriage should take place, which would leave Charley some weeks yet to remain before his   ORI)ER OF ARREST.          147 lci.. v n'ul!l be expended. Cl;arley lad seen Mr. Miller, and that gcntlctiull was very pleased to lmake arrangemeneLt with Charley, wlhereby he-Mr. Miller-would perform the ceremony. Two or three days had been pleasantly spent. All the necessary fiss, incident to a wedding, was made by the girls at Prince's. Every- body was pleased and happy but Clegg, whlo not only didn't get the ceremony to perform, but felt that he'ld better keep clear of P'rince's while John was about. One day, before the first week of the leave had expired, an officer knocked at the door of Prince's, and inquired for Capt. Jolln Prince and Col. Charles Montgorery. "That's us- come right in," said John, from withil, for he had overheard the inquiry-" show him in, Lena." Lena showed him into the dining- rooll, wlhere they were assembled at dlinner; but seeing ladies present, to' officer immediately withdrew. John went out to him, and asked the nature of his visit. "I regret to say that it is to mlake atl arrest," said the officer, evidently very deeply pained. "Thlere is sdme mis- take," said John Prince; "I cannot be the person you seek." "Are you Col. Montgomery?" asked the officer.  "No," said John; " ie .is inside; I am Captain John Prince." "Yes; the two names that are on my order of arrest;" and pro- ducing it, lie read it. John saw that Sidney's name was to the order, and it made him feel uneasy. He called Cliarley out, and told him what the officer wanted with them. Chllarley told the officer that tlhere was clearly a mistake. "Absence, without leave!" said Charley; "read( that," and lie gave to the officer the paper, signed by Old Te- cumsel. "There are two more of them," said Charley, "just like that one. One of them  is Captain Prince's, the other is Lieutenant Blackwood's." In spite of John's endeavors to the contrary, Mrs. Prince learned what was going on. She was quite excited by the occurrence, although John and Charley both assured her that nothing serious could ensue from the order of arrest. The young officer who had been detailed to make the arrest was very polite, and John and Charley could not be otherwise than satisfied with his conduct. "I must place you both under arrest for the present," said he, "but, I assure you you will not be caused any annoyance whatever." Both thanked him for his courtesy, and the young officer added: "I will lose no time in having Sidney telegraphed to, stating the c:se. Of course it will be all right before long."   "8       8URMBrSS ASO T TE ARREST Their arrest was really nominal, as it did/ot interfere with them, and the following day the young officer came and told them it was all right. "It was caused by a misunderstanding," he said. Mr. Boulton was astonished when he heard of it. "I wonder how it occurred?" said he to John Prince. "There is but one way in which it could occur," replied John, "and that is, that some of Sidney's friends from here have informed him that we were here. He supposing that, in desperation, we had come on without leave, grasped at the opportunity to punish Charley, and me, whom he knows as Charley's friend." He is astonishingly vindictive," remarked Mr. Boulton. "Very," said John. "I was afraid there was some trap in it at first. I half suspected that some one had stolen our leaves of absence. And furthermore, I suspected Rev. Mr. Clegg for it. I have formed a strong dislike for that man." "And it is very evident that you have," said Mr. Boulton, smiling. "I do not try to conceal it," returned John, " for I don't wish the man to have any countenance whatever in his visits here." "Here he comes now;" said Mr. Boulton, looking through the open window down the road, "a nd Charles is with him." "It is a wonder to me that Charley would walk with him," said John, going to the window; " but sure enough, there they are." The Rev. Mr. Clegg came on with Charley as far as the house, and entered with him. Charley walked right into the parlor, and the Rev. Samuel followed, and not seeing any one but Mr. Boulton and John Prince, he addressed himself to the latter: "Is your dear mother at home, Mr. Prince?" Under John's look of thorough dissatisfaction the smile, that Mr. Clegg had meant to be winning, died away. "No, she is not," answered John, and with very little sweetness in his voice or manner-; " would I be able to answer for her?" I am afraid not," said Mr. Clegg, resuming, and, under the same influenoe, again relinquishing his persuasive smile, "I was in hopes that your mother and sister would accompany me to a meeting of the ladies of the church, who are going to make lint for the use of the wounded soldiers." "O, you were," said John ; " well I don't think either of them will go. They will be likely to stay at home." Mr. Clegg could not but understand the manner of John, and   REV. CLEGG CRITICIZED.     B    144 seeing there was no chance for his comfortable stay, he took his leave. i If that fellow were a little more manly looking," said John, I'd trounce him." Then addressing Charley, he said: But what the mischief was he doing with you, Charley?" "I met him down at Mr. Miller's," said Charley, "and I couldn't shake him off. I tried hard enough, but unless I had kicked him from me,"-- "Which you should have done without hesitation," interrupted John, hotly. "I think he's the most contemptible fellow I ever met. Why, I never met a man in the whole army as sneaky as that hypo- critical Clegg. If he doesn't stop coming here I will certainly thrash him, although it would be a shame for a hearty man like me to lift my hand to him." "Why doesn't your mother prevent his visits?" asked Charley. "I don't think she can prevent them," replied John. "He comes sneaking in like a mangy cur when he finds the door open." '"I shouldn't think he'd come, if told not to by you," said Mr. Boulton. "I have often observed the man here, and can't say I hold a very flattering opinion of him." "Who could hold a good opinion of that cringing, fawning spaniel?" exclaimed John. "And his lhypocrisy makes him all the more nauseous. As for telling' him to stay away from here, I'll do that, and soon, too." "He is another creation of the war I think," said Mr. Boulton. "The war has created a new type of ministers among its many other creations. A new class has sprung up, who get the cars of their people under pretence of teaching them the gospel, and then harangue them on almost anything else, but particularly on the enormity of being anything else than a voter of some especi:al sort, or a thinker in some particular way. They will do the cause of religion great harm." "Yes, but they will doubtless earn a good living for themselves," said John, "and that is their chief aim. What does Rev. Mr. Clegg care for religion, the skunk?" "You are, maybe, a little hard on Clegg, John," said Charley; "he may be better than you think." "Well, I only hope,'for his own sake, that I am deceived," said John. "I can't get it out of my head though that he properly belongs in the penitentiary."   150            A WEDDING. That evening Charley told Mr. Boulton, quietly, that if John knew what Clegg really wanted when he called he would have certainly kicked him out. "H e was telling me, coining along the road," said Charley, "that to unite young hands and hearts in hlappy wedlock was his sincerest pleasure; and when lie found me inexo'llale in my determination that Mr. Miller should perform the ceremony for ile, he said that perhaps John Prince was also going to marry before lie left, and that lie would come over and see him. He actually came to see John about marrying him." And both laughed heartily at the idea of Clegg soliciting profes- sional business. '" 1e is, without a doubt," said Mr. Boulton, " a miserable fellow, but John is so hlotly against him now that I would rather cool hmn off, tlani inflame him by any word of mine. By the way, what did Mr. Miller say?" "Ie's a great deal better," said Charley, "and lie will be able to come over to your house if lie continues as strong as lie has been to- day." And then, lowering his voice, Charley said: "Mr. Miller says if the mnarriage was performed in the church, that Mr. Clegg would be apt to Dbotler lim. He lasn't a very good Opinion of Clegg. Mr. Miller used no stronger terms than 'Ipeculiar' and 'eccentric,' but I I could see that lie doesn't like the man." Well, we'll have the ceremlony take plae ait the house," said Mr. Boulton.  And at the house of Mr. Boulton, a happy party assembled on one fine morning soon afterwards. In a colocel's uniform new and briglt, Charley Montgomery looked very handsome and officer-like. John Prince, in just as fine a uniforim, only with a captain's in- signia, looked no less handsorme; wliile the third oflicer in the room was Frank Blackwood, looking, in the opinion of at least onle yollg lady of the p)arty, handsomner than eitlher of t}le others. John Prince and Frank Blackwood were both acting as Charley's groor1.. ,K1. Susie Montgomery and Carrie Prince were the bridesmaids, and very, very pretty they both looked. Mrs. Prince looked proudly upon each of her daughters, who were certainly very well deserving of her glances. Before the party liad been long assembled, the carriage of Mr. Boulton drove to the door, and Mr. Boulton aind John Prince going out, assisted Mr. Miller, who had arrived in the carriage, into tlhe house. The fine old gentleman was a little stronger than he had   TERMNATION OF THE C LEAVE."         151 been for some titme back, and was in the best of spirits. He shook hands with all that were assembled in the parlor of Mr. Boulton. At last the lhappy moment had come for Charley Montgomery. Proud and happy he stood up to receive the blessing invoked by the aged minister upon his marriage. After the ceremony had been performed, Mr. Miller did not annoy the party with cither a long prayer for the haplpiness of the wedded couple, nor witlh a lrosy advice to them, but with his trembling voice, most unmistakably echoing the sincerest wishes of his heart, he said: "May God bestow upon you, during long and happy lives, his choicest blessings." Deep down in each heart there was a responsive Amen! At a sulmptuously spread table in Mr. Boulton's dining-room the party io salt down, Mr. Miller at the head. The utmost good humor and happiness prevailed during the entire day and evening which the little party spent at Mr. Boulton's; and the association of Charley, in so far as it related to his occupancy of his room at Prince', clame to an end, for a very handsome suite of apartments had been fitted up for the now supremely happy pair at Mr. Boul- ton's lhouse. There is something contagious in marriage scenes. Before they got back to the house that evening, John Prince and Susie Mont- golmery had made a mutually agreeable arrangement for their com- minonl happiness. John had proposed, and was blushingly accepted by Stusie. Most reluctantly John and Charley found the last day of their lcitve" I approachng. Frank Blackwood, too, felt sorry that the time Nwas up, for lie found it exceedingly pleasant at Prince's. He and Carrie Prince had formed a very pleasant friendship, which Frank Black- wood was loth to interrupt. But the requirements of the case de- manded a separation, and the young officers prepared to depart. It caime the heaviest on the young husband and wife. Maggie clung to Charley, altogether unable to bring herself to allow him to leave her. And the poor fellow most heartily wished that by her clinging to him, she could retain him by her side. But she couldn't. And the three were at last, taking their last hand-shaking with the choking girls and their mothers. Charley had taken a private farewell before he left home with his dear little wife to come over to Prince's, where he  was to leave, with John and Frank. Mr. Boulton's carriage took them to the depot, where they got upon the train for Cairo. At this place they reported to the commander of the post, from whom   162          RETURN TO CAMP. they learned that their commands were at Nashville, Tennessee. They were also informed that there would be a government boat leaving that same day, on which they could go to Nashville. They took the boat, and in the long ride had plenty of opportunity rfor extended conversation. But for the first few hours each one appeared inclined to commune with himself. Ultimately, however, they fell into a general conversation, embracing nearly everything of interest to them. Arriving at Nashville, they at once reported to the commanding officer, and then resumed their commands. The men in both their commands hailed the return of their officers with -genuine pleasure. In reply to a question of John Prince, Lieut. Costello told him that during the absence of John, the men had enjoyed pretty fair health; and in reply to another, Lieut. Costello answered, "No, they didn't bear of it," which appeared to please John Prince. He wouldn't like the men to hear anything of his arrest and Charley's, for fear they might not fully understand the circumstances. \   CHAPTER XIII. WHCH IS ONE OF VARIETY, AND IN WHCH CHARLEY MONT-- GOMERY MEETS OLD FRIENDS AND MAKES A NEW ONE. IT was a matter of infinite pleasure to the returned officers to learn that Sidney was likely to remain away from their own direct com- mand. "It makes me feel a great deal more resignet? to the settling down to army life again," said Charley, " to know that the chances are, that we'll escape the immediate supervision of ' Our General.' " "I guess there are but few who do not share your satisfaction, Charley," said John Prince. "I think the boys ought to club together and possess themselves of that noble horse that tossed him at Carrollton," said Frank Blackwood, jokingly. "Yes, and keep that horse in style for the rest of his life," said John Prince; "feed him on the very choicest morsels that are delecta- ble to the equine palate, and never allow him to wear anything but silver shoes." "The animal came near proving a fatal present to 'Our General,'" said Charley: " there was a story going the rounds, that the 13th army corps presented Sidney with that horse, knowing that he couldn't sit him in his coolest moments." "I have been told," said John, " that he couldn't have kept his place on a board-pile' during a high wind, in the condition he was in on the day of the review." "So it seems," coincided Charley. "But, seriously, there was a long while there, that it was thought Sidney couldn't live. He was very seriously hurt by that tumble." "You ought to see some papers that Lieut. Costello got with an account of the affair in them,a*aid Frank. "Laudatory, as usual, of course," said Charley. " Some that way, antd one rather the other way," answered Frank. "But, hold on a minute, I'll get them." And Frank went away, soon returning with several newspapers. 153   154      LAUDATORY NEWSPAPER COMMENTS. "This one," he said, selecting one, "is a fair specimen of the laudatory ones, so it will do for that class. And this one," said he, taking another, " is the other way a little. It is a mystery to nme how it ever passed the notice of those very carefuil post-officers. Tlhcy are extremely apt to make any newspaper that contains disparaging accounts of 'Our General,' miscarry." "I have often noticed that," said John; "ttle papers that favor the General are given all the chances they could hlave to reach us, while those that perhaps contain adverse imatter, are cither stopped, or kelt back until their arrival gives us no pleasure. It seeinms to ine tlhat that branch of the Government is comnlletely run, as far as the army is cIncerned, in the interest of ' Our General.'" "Well, here's one that escaped their notice," said Frank. "But I'll read the other one first; it is friom the New York--- ; and Frank read as follows: "'The day was gorgeous with goldlcn beamns that came pouring-'" "Oih, cut that part," said John, "-and come to the point." "All right," said Frank ; " thlre's a good deal of that kind in it too; a half column to describe a nice, clear day." Searching down the page, at last he said : " ere it is," an( lie cornmienced ag r: "'Genle- ral Sidney, whom every eve had been eagerly looking for, at last made his appearance. As he came forward, unmoved by the shout of wild enthusiasm thlat rent the air' "- "Allow me, Frank," interrupted John; "is that wild shout of enthusiasm really there?" "It is certainly here," said Frank, " on paper." And again lie resumed: "' The noble features of the intrepid hero betrayed no sign of pride. As he rode down the line, the deafening cheer went up from loving hearts until the very air seemed to burst with the sound.' " "O11, my!" (jaculated John. "That was a grand sight, truly." "'But the heart of the nation was to be wounded,'" continued Frank, with his reading; " 'the fiery steed ridden by Gen. Sidney, which had been presented to him by the 13th army corps, became alarmed at the sudden burst of mlusic from the band of the --th regimeint'"- "What! through all that deafi ning cheer?" queried Charley. "So it says," answered Frank, and lie continued to read: "The expert rider was dashed to and fro by the stalwart and now maddened' animal like another Bucephalus, but he sat in his place, and with a muscle of iron lie reined in the terrified beast. Hearts ceased to   A DIFFERENT COMMENT.           155 beat as the horse plunged and jumped, leaping this way and that, when the danger to the beloved rider became apparent. At last the shock came. Human power could not control tlat animal, and with a terrible force the rider was thrown to the ground. He had remained in the saddle almost miraculously from the very first, but no manl could have kept his seat on that horse any longer. Soon the fallen general was surrounded by anxious friends, and when he was carried to the St. Charles Hotel it was fbund tlhat he was very severely in- jured. As your readers will anxiously look for every item of intel- ligence concerning the man who has so faithhfully served them in the field' "- "Oh, that will do, we can guess the rest," said John Prince. "I wonder if that correspondent wasn't a little sarcastic in hiis remark that Sidney kept his saddle miraculously from the first?" "Well, Whether lie intended to be so or not," answered Frank; "he was correct in the assertion, if there be be any truth in the other Arnd picking up the other paper, which was the Chicago T -- s, lie turned to an article headed "A Grand Review, and a Grand Tum- ble? "This, said Frank, " is somewhat different, both as to style and contents;" and lie commenced, to read: "' At a grand review at Carrollton, La., yesterday, General Sidney was taught a lesson that it is a wonder he did not learn long since. Under the impression that he liad b)ecome so used to being intoxicated, thlat lihe could get along just as well that way as in any other condi tion, lie attempted to ride a restless and scary horse in the review. 'Tle horse, which was not used to drums beating and cymbals clanging, commenced to dance, an!d, as a consequence, threw Sidney against a caisson. He was severely injured by the fall, and some fears are entertained that in the present condition of the man's brain, lie will not be able to stand the shock, but that, perhaps, brain fever or a kindred affection may ensue. It is rather shameful tlhat the coii- mander of one 'of tihe largest divisions in our army could not remain over long enough to show himself before his men in thie capacity of reviewing officer. That his example has not produced( a worse effect on the men under his command speaks volumes for their tendency to sobriety. A report, which we (do not credit, states that some of' those who presented the General with the new horse, knew thlat it would take a perfectly sober man to sit the animal, which was altogether unused to noise of any kind; and that they also knew equally well   156     SIDNEY RESUMES THE CHEF COMMAND. that the chances were strongly in favor of the General being ' hilarious with a little wine,' as our contemporary, the --, generously and charitably terms Sidney's fondness for the bottle; and that there was a good prospect ahead, if Sidney would use the horse, of relieving them- selves of his presence for a little while. However, we sincerely i)e- lieve that under General --, lwho will take command during Sid- ney's illness, the men will, if they have any work to do, do it with a better will, and with better results than heretofore.' "There," said Frank, "which of these two widely differing stories are we to accept as the true one?" "Not having been there," said Charley, "I would not like to judge. But from experience I should favor the latter account." It will not astonish the reader to be informed that both the other soldiers shared Charley's belief. "I will be very much surprised," said John, "if Sidney doesn't issue an order against the bringing of that paper into the lines. If I am not mistaken that is the very same paper that he issued an order against some time ago." "Yes, it is," said Charley; I recollect that it was on account of being 'inimical to the interests of the Government,' as the order ran." "Inimical to the interests of which Government?" asked John. "Of course he meant to the interests of our own Government," ln- swered Charley; "but I will agree with you that it seems to have more interest for this Government than the sweet-worded, flattering sheets that I see oftenest down here." After their trip this time, it generally occurred that when letters were brought from home for John and Charley, Frank got one also; and the delicate penmanship of the address on the envelope John readily recognized as his sister Carrie's handwriting. Thlese missives gave Frank a great deal-of pleasure, as the others did their respective receivers. Early in the fall of the same year, 1863, Sidney again took the chief command, much to the dissatisfaction of the men, and to the particular disgust of our friends Charley Montgomery and John Prince, who had, perhaps, more good reason to be dissatisfied thain any other two men under Sidney's command. "I have a very serious notion of resigning, John," said Charley, when he heard of the filct of Sidney being appointed to the chief com- mand of the post. "Oh, that wouldn't do at all, Charley," said John Prince, in a   CHARLEY WISHES TO RESIGN.        157 most serious tone. "Why, you'd lose a great deal of the honors you have gained so far, by taking a step of that kind."  I don't want to serve any further under Sidney," said Charley, decidedly. "I will resign at once, and would counsel you to do the same." "No, Charley:' answered John; "I will do nothing of the kind; who would believe that it was simply because Sidney had resumed command that we were resigning?" "What need we care what they think?"said Charley. "I would try and get another regiment, and get with it under some other command, so that it couldn't be said I tired of fighting my country's battles." "Now, Charley," argued John, warmly, "it seems very reasonable to believe that the war is nearly ended. It certainly seems impossible fbr the South to hold out much lonlger. Why not stick it out here, as we have been doing. Just count in Sidney's superintendence as one more disadvantage." "I can't reconcile myself to look so resignedly upon the matter," said Charley. "There are a hundred things all combining to urge me to the act I contempllate. That affair of poor Mr. C---d's, more than all the rest, makes me have a horror of Sidney." "Well, at least defer any further action for a day or two," said John. "Do this now as a special favor for me." "I would do anything for you, John," said Charley, grasping the hand of the latter, cordially; " and this little ' favor,' as you term it I will willingly do." Charley's resignation was not only deferred for a day or two, but indefinitely deferred. For nearly a month they now settled down to the quiet routine of their camp life, when orders were received for an advance. Without wearying the reader with the tedious marching, we will go at once to the spot which our immediate friends had reached, and reunite the reader with Charley and John. An important and extensive recon- noissance was ordered, and Charley was placed in command of the men forming the reconnoitring expedition, which was corhposed of his own regiment and John's company. Leaving Chattanooga, where they had reached on this march,Clarley started on a march due west, for about twenty-five miles, and then went southward. He continued, making a complete circle around the enlmy. He tore up the railroad south of the enemy, breaking their communications; he had numerous skirmishes in his march, which   158     CHARLEY ARRIVES AT HS OLD HOME. lasted for eight days, and during which he lost about one hundred men, and was himself slightly wounded. Lieut. Costello was also wounded, but neither of their wounds interfered seriously with them. On the eighlth day of his march, Charley began to observe familiar objects along the road. "About thirty miles farther on," said he to John Prince, on the morning of' the eighth day, " there is a plantation of my father's. I am anxious to reach it as some one on the place will be able, doubtless, : to give me soine information of my father." "I have heard you speak of the place," said Johil, ( but I didn't think we were in that direction." "It is right in the very northeast part of this State," said Charley. "I haven't bee'n on the old place for nearly twelve years." "No one there will know you, will they?"' said John. "No, unless some of the family from home are on the place." "Some of the family' from home?" said John, really astonished. "Yes, some of the 'family,' John," laughed Charley; " that's what we call the whole lot of them. At home we had over seventy of a family.' "Oh, I see," said John. As they rode on Charley was continually telling John whose place it was they were passing until lhe finally said, "This is our place." Placing the men in camp around the ground, Charley accompanied by John Prince walked up to the mansion that stood on the planta- tion. On the porch stood an intelligent looking mulatto who uncovered as Charley advanced towards the house.  He seemed somewhat undetermined what to do, and awaited the coming of the two officers. "Whose plantation is this?" inquired Charley. "Masser Montgomery's, sah," said the man. "And you are his overseer, I suppose," said Charley. ItYes, sah,l" answered the man, bowing. "My name is Caesar, sah." "Where is your master?" said Charley, with more concern in his voice than the overseer noticed. The answer did not come promptly, and Charley at once understood the fears of the overseer. "You need not fear, Cesar," said Charley in an assuring tone. "We did not ocme to do any barm to the place or to you." Caesar, thus encouraged, told Charley that, Masser Montgomery   A JOYOUS WELCOME.           159 was with Bowrigord, up in Tennessee, and he gave the information with unqualified reluctance. "Is there any one here from the South Carolina plantation?" queried Charley, to the evident surprise of Caesar. "Ye -yes, sail," said Cwesar, his eyes opening very wide, "thar's sevrel. Thar's old Cassy "- "Cassy here!" exclaimed Charley, in a tone of genuine pleasure. "Toll her at once tlhat I want to see her." Off went Caesar wondering how the young officer could possibly know CaSiy. C(nssy came out to where Charley had remained, talking to John, on the pi)oreh. She was a k lindly looking old negress of more thhan usual, among her race, intelligence of appearance. On her head was. the inevitablle bandana turban, just high enough to disclose an edging underneath of grey hair. She came out with a hesitating kind of manner, witlh her eyes fixed on Charley. Gradually she began to lookl more intently u)pon him, and when he had said, kindly, "Don't you know me, Cassy?" she hurried over to him, and crying out: ("Youni Massa Montgomery!" threw her arms around him and, from the manlner in which she lifted Charley right off his feet, John thoughts she lilad, for her age at least, amazing strength. "Why! Massa Montgomery! I declare! Why!"Cassy exclaimed at intervals, after she had set Charley free from her affectionate clasp, and was surveying him from head to foot with mixed pride and admiration. "Who'd 'a thoulght you'd 'a grown so? Laws I But, young Massa, you must be hungry. Lord bress your dear soul, come right in an get som-en to eat." Charley assented to the arrangement, and before many minutes he and John were sitting down to a very substantial supper, of a kind they had not tasted since they had left home. Soon the news spread amnong the "family," that "young Massa" was in the house, and quickly the room adjoining the one occupied by the young officers, was filled with a sable company, all anxious to get a glimpse of Charley. Some among them who had seen Charley at home in South Carolina, walked right into the room, and with smiles of the most intense pleasure displaying their snowy teeth, would go up to Charley, and shake hands with him as though they had been old companions. Charley was glad to see them all, and told them so. After they had finished supper, Cmsar came in and placed on the table a box containing some cigars. Each of the young friends helped himself, and both agreed that the cigars were very good.   160         THE OID PLANTATION. F'or a long time after supper the two smokers conversed: with a feeling of satisfaction produced only by a good supper, and a good cigar afterwards: and Charley told John many entertaining incidents relating to the old plantation they were then on. Cassy, he told John, had been his " mammy " on the other plantation, on which he had been born and raised. Caesar he had never seen before, but he glessed, he said, that he was a clever, faithful fellow, or lie would not be lcft in cllarge now under such circumstances . "But, John," said Charley, referring to his watch, "I would like you to go see everytlhing right; and be particularly careful with the pickets; we are in a dangerous place. I want to have a talk with the overseer." John went off to the men, and Charley, having sent for Csesar, and he having made his appearance, made the man sit down near to hilm. "When was my father here?" asked Charley. "About two weeks 'go, young Massa," answered Caesar, respectfully. "Massa was troubled 'bout you too," he added. "He doesn't know that I was in the Federal army, surely?" said Charley. "No, young Massa, I don't think he did. But he know you in the Northt somewhere. HHe was very anxious, Massa was." Charley's face grew sad. His affectionate heart sorrowed at the thought of his father's anxiety for the safety of himself and his mother. The goodhearted Casar seemed to share the depression of Charley, for, when he spoke again, his voice was lower and softer, and his flace wals very solemn. "I overhear Massa tell another officer that was with him last. time he was here, and -they tas sittin smokin just here too, younl Massa," said Cesar, designating where Charley was himself seated-- "he says to the other officer, says he, ' enr'l, I am weighed downv by an-by an--' " and Caesar came to a halt. "I' don't know jus the very words he used, young Massa, but he meant he was offully bothered for you and Missus." Charley was not apt to be cheered by this kind of a conversation. "You say that the officer with my father was a General. What is my father's rank?" "I don't know, young Massa," responded Casar. Then, after a moment's musing, he said: "I didn't say the other oflicer was a Genr'l, did I, young Massa?" "You surely did," said Charley. "Why, I can't tell 'em. I am shuah I don't know when they come   A lNIGHT AT THE OLD HOME.          161 here whlat they are, 'cept they aint soldiers. 'Cause soldiers all look ragged, and the officers that comes with Massa, they clean and nice dressed." Chaurley was a little amlused witl the distinction that Cesar had mnade between a man that was, and one that was not a soldier. "Bt t, Cesar, do you not remllember sa!ng' that my father said to the other officer, that was liere with hinl'General, I am bothered about my wife and son,' or sold;llting like that?" "Yes, young Massa, I tol(d you tlhat much. But indeed, I couldn't tell you what kind ot :an oilver the other gen'ltman was." "Why, you say, my fiathelr .called hm General," said Charley. "Yes, sah, so lie (did, young Massa." "Then -thhe othher ust llave!)een a General, don't you see?" Cesar studied a moment, tand then, with his white, even teeth again fillly lisp;layed, and with one hand giving a little scratch to his head, hle :al sw(rietl: "Sli8t1ll entutt, young Massa." \Vell, whlat did tilhe General cull my lther?" asked Cllarley, PItv! certa"l'till th;lt eh'(1 get the informa:tion he was seeking, in that C-es11ar ,tnused ftr a little while, and answered : "Why, lie call Massa { c'(T'al too."                   ,  Cdha ley talked for a long titme with Ct(esar about everything that \would be of interest or aldvntalt  to him. Just as tlhey were, finishing, alnd while Charley was delivering instructions to C:esar, and giving him lltessages for delivery to Mr. AMontgomlery, when lie should return, Johnlll1 ca:llne iil.

But they pre- ferred to room -togetler, an(d sending Cesar to the camp after Lieuts. Costello and Blackwood, Charley, on their arrival, offered them the other room, which they gladly accepted. Next morning the march was again taken up. Cassy, with a very broken voice, bade Charley good-bye. "' Lor' bress you and take care of you, youlng Massa," she, said, with Charley's hand in both of -her own, while tears streamed down her shiny furrowed cheeks. "He will, I hope, Cassy," said Charley, much affected by the de- votedness of the faithlful woman.    162       A CONFEDERATE CAPTAIN)S VIE;Wb. "I will pray to Him, Massa Charley, and I'll make 'erm all pray to Him for you," said the pious Cassy. As long as she couldl keep him in sight, Cassy watched the fast disappearing form of Chlarle y, and 'then ret urnled sorrowfully to the house, leaning on Cuesar, wlio liad accompaniied lher.

And then lie added  Washington and , is aIIrmy were nlot ctalled fols, except," said the Captain with a peculiar look at Charley, " by tlhe English." "ThcIe case was very diflerent, tlhoug," said Cl(arley, not quite as. well posted in just wlhat tie diflrence was as Is e wotld like to have been. "Then we were trying to resist the unwarrantable assumptions of the mother country." "Your words, with very little altering, will explain our present posi- tion, Colonel," said Calt. Lawrence. "Only substitute tlic Nortl foir tlhe mother country-and, indeed, the North assumced to be the mot1ier of the rest of the States-and your very assertion of the patriots of '76 will answer for us." Charley was in some doubt as to whether he should continue such a conversation; but he, thought, surely, lie could measure arguments with this man, who was not in condition to take his own part, and that of the people he was fighting for, in any other way.   INEFFICIENCY OF GEE OF GENERAI  OF THE NORTH.   163 "You cannot hope, surely," said Charley, "that you will be as successfil as were the heroes of '76?" "Why,' sir," said Capt. Lawrence, earnestly, "I certainly do. I assure you that I do not want to offend you ; nor do I wish to lessen the credit to which your army is entitled. But in proportion to our numbers and advantages, our men have been so far superior to yours"- "Wait a moment!" exclaimed Charley; " excuse me, ('Captain," lie saidi, in a quieter tone; " you will readily understand tlhat from our relative positions, this discussion is hardly the right one. I am not disposed to dodge your tar'ellll!ts at all. But I think we had better avoid the topic; it would only run into a warm dispute as to the respective merits of the men in our army, and the men in yours.'" "Allow me, Colonel," said Capt. Lawrence, with warmth. "I did not, nor could I, disparage the fighting qmaltics of your army. They are as brave a set of men as the worldl conutaius, aid11 coilnbine the armies as they now are, and I believe firmly that no nation on the earth could resist the colibination ; but you misunderstood wxhat I said at first. I meant to say, that considering the "poor acommo datioins of our men, their miserable food, of which they do not get enough, their almost worth less equipment, and, in fact, their dismal- va:ltages in every way; they are rivalling the Spartans in their efforts." "And it will all end, and very soon," said Char11ley, desirous of closing the discussion, " in 'your being subjected. I lhave often wondered, certainly, that you have been able to hlold out this long." "I will tell you one thing, Colonel," said Capt. Lawrence, "if you'd reverse thngs a little, it woulld explain it." "How do you mean?" asked Charley. "I mean this," said Capt. Lawrence: "that if we had your army, with our generals to lead it, we'd make a very short piece of work with this war." "Then you think your management has been better than ours, do you?" asked Charley, half pleased at this indirect opinion, which, of course, reflected chiefly on Sidney. "I lon't think there is any room for doubt in the mind of any fair man, who is capable of forming a proper opinion of the matter. If' you had had our generalship," said the Captain,'decidedly, "we would have had our ' backbone broken' long ago, as your papers are con.   164.        EVERYTHLNG IS SIDNEY. tinually declaring that it is;" and the Captain seemed quite amlused by the declaration of the fracturing process. "We sometimes get hold of your papers, Colonel," said Capt. Law- rence. "I have one with me," and he pulled from his breast-pocket a paper, which he opened. He pointed out to Charley a column, in which the assertion, that "the backbone of the rebellion was broken," was printed in large type. The rmost fulsome praise of Sidney and sharp criticisms on nearly every other officer of prominence were in the article. "There is a good deal of mystery to us, in that kind of thing, Colonel," said Capt. Lawrence. "In what kind of thing?" queried Charley. "In the guilding of that General of yours," answered Capt. Law- rence; " we never get one of your papers in which it is not contained. Everything is Sidney, Sidney, Sidney; and as I don't think your people are by any nleans fools, as you were good enough to denominate us a while ago, I think there must le some meaning in it." "I don't precisely undet'stand you, Captain," said Charley, with a pretty fair surmise, nevertheless, as to what the Captain was getting at. "No, Colonel," said the Captain, "I presume not. I don't ludler- stand myself. But when I see a man like your General Sidney var- nished and blowed and -puffed, I tlink there nlust be something in it. Why," said the Captain, energetically, "that man's continuance in his present position is the greatest hope of our people. I may honestly acknowledge, that had his predecessor continued, it is my belief that we would before this time have succulnbed(." Charley was not as much astonished at the declaration as would secen reasonable in the premises. Ite could' not be surprised for the simple reason that many, very many of his brother officers held the very same opinion, and leld it very firmly. Charley brought the talk to a close, by a supposititious opinion that he was needed, and would have to leave the termination of the discussion to another time. Afterwards, repeating to John Prince what the Confederate Captain had told him,.about the opinion enter- tained among the Confederates as to the advantages of Sidney's retention of the position he then held, Charley said: "I just tell you, John, that Capt. Lawrence is a brave fellow, and he appears to be a gentlemanly man. I like him very much." "I'll make his acquaintance," said John Prince. And so he did make the acquaintance of Capt. Lawrence, and he   CHARLEY'S FATHER.           165 found him, as Charley had supposed of him, a brave and courteous man. 4 My iame is Prince," said John, " and in our army, you see I hold the same position you do in yours. Only that I am captain of a companlly of scouts." I  was talking for a long time with your Colonel a while ago," said Capt. Lawrence. "Do you know where he camie from? I have seen a lacc very like his in somne place." "His name is Moitgomtlery," saiid John. Montgomery."  And Capt. Lawrence repeated the name over and over again.  Suddenly; he said: atls he any one belonging to him in our service, Capt. Prince?" "I believe he has," said John. "His father holds some rank, but I don't know exactly what." "Bult 1 (o," said Capt. LatwrncLe. "his father is Brig.-Gen. Montgomery. I could swear to the resemblance." "I wouldn't be astolisthed if you are correct," said John. "I am almost certain of it," said Capt Lawrence. "aee  1 kept won- dering, ever siince I first laid eyes on him, where I could have seen him. It was not, him that 1 had scemn at all, but his Ithler, lBrig.-Gen. Montgomery, whom I have seen very often, indeed no later than the day beftore our capture." John knew thlat Charley would be glad to talk again with the Confederate Captain, antd upon a very different subject. He 'went and told Charley what Capt. Lawrence had told him about his father. "I saw the man looking at me several times," said Charley, " in a peculiar way, and I was a little uncertain as to what it meant. I understand now." "It is a wonder to me you didn't ask him, the very first chance you got, all about your father that he might know." "I didn't think of him  knowing anything about it," replied Charley. "Moreover, I wouldn't have cared to broach such a subject under the circumstances. But I'll see him again, and have another talk with him." That afternoon they reached Knoxville. Chalrley reported to the commander at the post, and was by him ordered into camp. To the Provost Marshall he turned over his prisoners, and they were placed  :L building that was alloted for use as a guard-house. In the 'v(e,.iln Charley asked .Joln it he cared to go over to the "guards;" Ae   166       8 A MUCH DREADED MEETING. that he would like to see Capt. Lawrence again. Jolln signified hil willingness to go, and the two proceeded to the place. Capt. Lawrence seemed quite pleased to see Charley. He offered his and when Charley came in, and said to him in a very friendly manner: "Col. Montgomery, under my present knowledge of you, I am most heartily glad to see you." "Capt. Prince was telling me that you have seen my father," said Charley, after thanking him for his good feeling. "Yes, Colonel," replied Capt. Lawrence, " the day before you took us, I saw him." Was he well? ' asked Charley. ' Quite well, sir," replied the Captain. "To whose command is he attached?" inquired Charley, with a quiet enougl manner, but awaiting the reply with painful anxiety. "To Gen. Longstreet's," replied Capt. Lawrence. Charley turned a little pale, and Capt. Lawrence observed it. "I see the fears yolu entertain, Colonel," said Capt. Lawrence. "And since Capt. Irince told mle that you were the son of Brig.-Gen. Montgomery, I have myself been tortured by the picture my mind conjured up. Believe me, sir, I would cleerfully lay down my lifi, if by so doing I could avert the meeting of yourself and your father on the battle-field as foemen." And the voice of Capt. Lawrence, as he spoke, betrayed the strong emotions that he filt. He had impressed Charley very strongly with his own feelings, too, nld it was sonme moments before any one spoke. "But there need not of necessity ever be such a meeting," said John Prince. "Dispel such notions firom both of your minds." "You are right in what you say, Capt. Prince," said Capt. Law- rence. "It is at least more sensible to look upon it in that way." Charley gradually recovered his feelings, and for some time sat and talked to Capt. Lawrence, about how his father had been since entering the Conlfderate service. What battles he had been in, and almost everything else pertaining to his fither's movements since the breaking out of the war. "Your father is one of the bravest soldiers we have," said Capt. Lawrence, "and none is better liked in the army than he." Charley expressed his gratification, and soon after the three of them well into another discussion of army matters; what the prospect was for the Confederates, and what would be the result if they would fail.   ENGLAND'S SHARE IN THE WAR.         167 "Why," said John Prince, " your people lhave no more chance of cOeedling than I would have, were I to attempt to fight you both ;" I1(1 John lauglled at the simile he had rmade. "I guess neither of ou will be too much flattered that I think my chances for a victory ver you )both, would be very slil," lie addled. "You have drawn a comparison of about the relative strength of le alrmies," said the Confedlerate Captaiib poilntedly; "that's just bouit what it is, and lias been from the comllmencement." \\ell, I entertain a very diflerent nation,"t said John, still good- aturethy, but firmly ; "I tlink we are fighting your army, and fight- Ilk, England, too." "O1h1, nonselse: I beg your pardon, Captain," sail the Confederate Ia)t;inl catching himself; "I said that word hastily, and didn't call it." "Thlat's all riglt," said John Prince; " but tlere's no nonsense louti it, thlough, tfr all that. I tell you, England is lying in ambush ring away at us just as tast sand as hard as she can. And there's a vil- llns lot of the sneaky galutes of the North that are as hard to come t us your army here in the field." "Why, John, you are getting warimed with your argument," said Cliarley. "And it's no wonder, Charley," said John, really warm and fast rettiig warmer, as lie proceedleid. "There's a lot of confounded inglo-saxon sneaks, principally backed up by a few Anglo-yankees hat are undoing our workll  just tas filt as we perf'orm it. It's all very veil for the politicians on one side to say it's the other political party hlat are the copper-leadls, but even tlose who use the term use it illsely, and they either know it, or are idiots." "From tI}e contents of your ow\1 papers," spoke Capt. Lawrence, " we larve long been expecting material aid from that party you speak of, lhat are called copp)erheads. But we have been disappointed thus far." "So )you will be," said John, "if you expect aid from any political :)arty in the North, as a body. Both parties are alike. Both are indtlubtedly almost a unit for the preservation of the Union. Aind n .b1oth are individuals who fiavor your cause. No, no; I tell you t's the Anglo-saxon Yankee party we have to fear at home, and E[gland abroad. And I, for one, am willing when this dispute ,etvctte ourselves is settled, to call England to an immediate account r lt' miselllleu, sneaky conduct in stalbling usC i n i tie dark in the ,.. "t'.,1 s leC. i i):tc'tising silnc our trouble began."   168       WANT OF MLITARY SKILL. "I have no doubt England would like to see the United States divided," said Charley, "her chances of gobbling them up would be improved." "Yes, and she's doing all she can towards that olject," said Joln Prince, indignantly. "If it hadn't been for her help to the South, we would have finished this war long ago. Why, as to your armies" he said to Capt. Lawrenee,>" they'd stand no time in our w.ay." "About that I differ," said Capt. Lawrence. "As I said to Col. Montgomery this morning, I have observed that vour men are real fighters from their liats to their shoes, but reviewing the ground that has been1 gone over, in the abstract, I think you will agree that our men havo, under their many disadvantages, done wonlders. Tllhr is, however, an explanation for part ofit." "How (lo you mean ?" asked Charley and John, both togetler. "Why, in the poor generalship oil your side, since Sidlney took commanl."   Then lhe said, seriously, " there have been times Nwhen,l if it hadn't been for his stupidity, there was no earthly cluance for us to continue. Indeed, tle only hope of our army, when there are a great many disadvantages, and there are always plenty of them, is, that Sidney will manage things on the other side. Many and many a time, when a week's respite was valuable to us, we were allowed to have two weeks or a month. In fact, your General has but one plan, and that is to crush by superior numbers. Why, if le was in com- mand of our troops, you'd have the war ended in thirty days, if your army was for that length of time generalled by a sane man." It seems to me," said John, " that you eitler don't consider 'Our General' a sane man, or else that hle'asn't much strategy, or military skill." "  ilitary skill! Now, you cannot but know as well as I do, that Gen. Sidney has about as much strategy in him as there is in an oyster," said Capt. Lawrence, disgustedly. "Or else," said he, "if he does possess the strategy, he keeps it to himself. You never see any of it. Look at thirty tlousand of us keeping him out of Vicks- burg for nine months, and hie with two hundred thousand troops. I recollect, that when Sidney was elevated to the command of the army of the Tennessee, there was a rejoicing among our people that would have honored him, were it among his own men." "What was the meaning of that?" said John. "Simply, that.our own officers had, a great many of them, known him both in West Point and at Mexico," said Capt. Lawrence. "The     THE DISCUSSION TERMNATED.        169 rejoicing was principally the effect of their assurance that Sidney would be the means of our success. Gen. A--, of our army, who was allassmate of Sidney's, is reported to have said, 'Sidney was, without a single exception, the greatest blockhead at West Point, during his recollection.'" Notwithstanding the opinions of tile Confederate Captain fully corresponded with their own, the two young officers were impressed with a vague idea that soldierly duty dictated a terminiation of the discussion. So, changing the subject to that of his father's precise position with his command in tile army to their left, after some fur- ther conversation, Charley brought the interview to a close, and hle and John Prince returned to camp.   CHAPTER XIV. IN WHCIh NOT ONLY CHARLEY BUT JOHN PRINCE FINDS A FATHER. ON reaching his tent, John found two letters lying on his table, that had arrived during his absence. He recognized the writing on both envelopes. Opening the one-whllic  was from Susie Mont- gomnery-he read every word with an eagerness that would indi- cate a very keen interest in the writer of the letter. John read the letter over several times, alld, seeing that no on was observing hml, he kissed the letter three or four times, and then folding it up, placed it back in the envelope, and put it in his pocket. He then took up the other letter, and after he had read for some time, his countenance began to indicate a surprise over the contents. He did not go straight on to the end of the letter, but read and re-read a certain part of it. Hastening over to Charley Montgomery, lie said, with the letter still in his hand: "Charley, my dlear fellow, I1 am going to be your brother-in-law." And le looked at Charley, solemnly. Charley looked at him, and then at the letter he held in his hand, and commenced to consider the meaning of his words. "Going to become my brother-in-law?" asked Charley, in great doubt as to what John meant, and having one mental solution of the enigma that he wouldn't expre ss.         s "Yes, sir, precisely," answered John, mysteriously. Charley pondlered the matter over; discarding the one explanation, the most reasonable, that he had first thought of' he wondered whether Maggie Boulton had a sister that he hadn't heard of, that John Prince had been proposed to by1; for John Prince had a letter in his hand, and it might be a proposal, only Charley thought that the girl might have waited for a month or so, and got into leap year, 'vhell such a transaction would the e more warrantable. He turned it over and over, without getting any satisfactory result. "My brother-in-law, you said?" asked Charley again. "Your brother-in-law," said John, without a trace of smile; "those were the very words I said."   HOW CHARLEY AND JOHN BECAME BROTHERS-IN-LAW.    171 And Charley again began to solve, if possible, the, to him, mystery of how John could become his brother-in-law. He became thoroughly confused in his considerations of the subject. "Have you discovered that Maggie Bonlton has a brother living ?" asked Charley, thinking that lie had tie explanation now for a certainty. " o, I have not," said John. 'Thell how in the deuce do you make out your case?" asked Charley, growing impatient. "I didn't make it out at all," responded John. "Listen for a moment, and you will see who did," and John held the letter up and said: "I have concluded, my dear son, to accept the oflfr of marriage, ide me sonic time ago, by Mr. Boulton.'" And John looked at Charley, whose countenance expressed most uiine surprise. "That's from your mother, isn't it?" asked Charley. "No one else calls me dear son," remarked Jolln, "except eggy, and he never but once. But wait until I read you another tr\ct. "' We have decided to be married in the coming month of May, if u c(an get a leave for that time; for we are both most anxious for u to be present.' "I guess we can go and enjoy that happy scene,"' said Jon1n, fold- , up the letter, and consigning it to the same post-office that he had eed( Susie's ill. "We can't tell anything about that, of course," said Charley.' "But there is any possibility of getting home we will;" and Callrley's e lit up with the pleasure of the anticipation. "Mother says," said Joln, " 'that if I can get hore, to let her ow,w and they will postpone the ceremony.'  Well, I never thought out anything of' this kindl. Did you?" he asked of Charley. "I lhadn't the slightest thoughts of it," responded Charley. ' I'll tell you wlat I'll be apt to do, old fellow, if I do get home tlat scene, I'll make it doubly'festive," said John, withl enlplhasis. ' fow?" asked Charley. "If Susie is ready, I'll make a double marriage of it," answered 1in. "That is," said lie, less impulsively, "if there is any olne to ite us but Rev. Clegg." Both were silent for a few moments. Charley suddenly reached his id to John. "My dear friend," said he, with intense satisfiaction   ]172          PAINFU;    ' , iTS. in his tone, "you can't conceive how happy you mnake me by this declaration." "It surely cannot surprise you, Charley," said John. "You must have known before this that Susie and I had come to a pretty explicit understanding that we were to marry at some time." "I was not so sure of that, John," said Chlarley, seriously, "I did know that you and my sister were friendly correspondents; but I never ventured to believe that you would ultimately marry." "I am pretty certain that Susie understands the thing better than that," said John, confidlently. "Well, it is altogetlrr unnecessary for me to sky, John, my dear friend, that there is no other 1manl living, that I knowt , whoml I would as soon see Susie Inlri"." And Charley again pressed the hand of liS friend. I'll go righlt '. and answer both these letters," said John. And he left Chllearly, witl llis heart filled witl as much gladness oveir his pleasurable aniticilations, as it could vell contain. 1Shortly aft'er this (conversationl, Longstreet madle an assault oll tle works a:otidlll Knoxville.

I would like to continue our conversation, but," ie added-pointing to the sash that he wore over his right shoulder, designating him as field officer of the day-" this comes first, you know ;" and off be lihurried. Mounting his horse, Charley rode to the picket post, a short distance outside of wlich a small detachment of Confederate Cavalry had halted. He at once rode out to the party, and dismounting he handed the rein of his horse to his orderly. The officer in charge of the flag of truce was a tall, well formed nlan of appearently fifty years of age. He wore the uniform of a brigadier. On his face was an expression of manliness, and lie seemed courteous, but not cringing. He saluted Charley Montgomery as the latter addvanced. As the hand of Charley went up ill response to the salute of the Confederate officer, it abruptly stopp)ed, anl a look of atlazemtenlt overspread Charley's countenance. The Confiderate of- ficer observed Charley's manner and seemed mystified by it. At last, Charley, after keenly gazing at the officer, said, excitedly: "Father!" With a start, the officer looked for an instant Imore intently upon1 Charley, and then exclaimed: "My son! Oh! Charles." Tle two grasped and shook eacl other's hand witl a feeling of hlearty joy. Charley was overcome by the meeting, and nian and soldier as he was, lie could not, in spite of his strongest efforts to restrain it, keep the flood fromn his eyes. His soldier's duty came first, however, and Charley asked the nature of the communicatioln. "I have a despatch for your commander," said Charley's father. Charley, taking the despatch from his fatiher; had it forwarded by the officer of the picket to Gen. Burnside, and after tespaltching his orderly for some wine and cigars, and telling him where to bring them, Charley and his father withdrew to a house just outside the line, in the vicinity.  Seating themselves at a table, both their minds filled with strange thoughts and their hearts with strong feelings, occasioned by their meeting, both awaited the other's opening of the conversation. "On our way over, Charles," at length spoke the father, "you assured me that your mother and Susie were well; where are they?" Charley gave his father a full account of the trip of his mother and sister, from their home in search of him, how they found him, and how comfortable and safe they were now at Prince's.   174     INTERVIEW BETWEEN FATIHER AND SOI. "Thank God!" said Gen. Montgomery, fervently, when Charley had finished.                        l "Many a night, the thought of them and of you, my son, caused me a painful wakefilness that I could not overcome." Taking his son's hand again in Ilis own, he said: "I am   now satisfied, Charles; except," and his brow clouded, and his voice was sorrowful-"  except that I find you, my son, striking against your kinsmen and strugglin' to help your enemies." "' athelr, sai( Charley, elnbarrassed by his fither's look and Ilman- ner, " you alld I must not dlifler personally on this point. hieaven knows it wrings my heart sorely enough to know   thlat we arc on different sides.

Antd othl shhuddered as Chlarley spoke the words. "[ have constanltly prayed," said Clharley, resuin ing, " that this I migh!t Db spared. And, thank Providence, miy prayers have tlius far bee!n hearl," ( l:trles," said the old man, imnpressively, "I, too, have made that my consthutf praveyr.' "Whv, you did not know of' my being in the army,did you, father?" asked Charley, in surprise. "I was not positive, Charles" answered his faither; " but I had hoard the iaimne a:iotg our owl inen very often. Some sixteen nonthis ago, somict exclang(ed prisoners tlatt were plac'ed in liiy comlllliand, on their return spoke of' a Charles Moltgonmlry, caDtain of' the scouts I am not sure; but after gettingo a descrition of tihe offlicer fionticne of the men that had seen him, I becaine impressed with the conviction tlhiat it was vou." Charlcy irenlcmnbered that about the time his fatler had mentioned, there were some p)risoners, that he himself had taken, exchanged from his own camp. The orderly now came in with the wine anti the cigars. Charley, as the orderly was leaving, told him to let them know wlien the des- patch was returned, and he and his father proceeded to enjoy thlem- selves for a short time. Charley told his father all about his ride through Tenhessee, aud of his visit to the plantation. "Old Cassy must have been nearly wild with delight to see you," said Gen. Montgomery.   A PAINFUL PARTING.           175 "She appeared to be," suid Charley. And then it occurred to him to tell his father of Capt. Lawrence. "I also took some prisoners on that trip," said Charley, "among them a Capt. Lawrence He appeared to know you." "Capt. Lawrence?' I should think he did know me.    And a cleverer gentlemnan you never met," said Charley's father, decidedly. "He impressed me that way," said Charley. And he related to his father part of the conversation he had with Capt. Lawrence. "A great deal of it, if not every word of it, truthful as the gospel itself, Clarles,' said the old gentleman, emDhlatically. While Charley was inthrlnling his fItlther of' his marriage to Maaggie Boult)ll, the ordlclly came inl to say that the answer to the deslpatch. thald ,teen rturnled fi'om General Burnsidc. RReluctantly the long- sj)rl',.ted fltlc'her and son arose to return to the (detachIment of the Whe\el thev oot back, the answer of the Generalen cot)manldinig to the :es:'o )of (Gen.

Muoa o      In'octe you y Good-bye!" "Gool-bye, fatet'lr," trcliblingly resDonlded Clharley ; and like one in a tl caml lie gaz(ed after the rcccding f'orm of' his father. Uplon his retrn lihe told John Prince of his meeting with his father. I was afraid," said Clharley, "tlhat lie would feel it more keenly than lie did my being in the Union ar'my. Few men on the other side arc stauneler fi'iends of tlce cause than he is." 'It would have been no fitting time," said John, " for hirm to have expressed in any kind of harsh terms his disapprobation of your ( t)11i I S. I' Tlmat's the way it looks to you, John," replied Charley; " but lie culd not be expected to think of that. All I thought of, when I first recognized him, was, first, joy at our meeting under such liaceful cir- culnstances; next, fear of his hot anger at my being arrayed against imy people. That's, of course, the way he looks at it." "But he shouldn't think of it in that way," argued John, getting deeply interested in what threatened to become a discussion as to the   176          WINTER QUARTERS. propriety or impropriety of Charley's occupancy of the position of a soldier in the Union army. "Well, we wont discuss it, John," said Charley, fearing to let tlhe topic continue one for argument. "I am too much delighted to have seen him, and too grateful that it was in the way that I did see him, that we met, to talk mullc now about anything else." And John seeing the obrce of Charley's remark at once dropped the discussion, and talked to Charley about how his father looked, andl how he thought his army would be able to recover from their last drubbing. "My father is still hopefil for their success," said Charley; "anid, isn't it strange? he actually corroborated every word that Capt. La:w- rence said concerning the opinions entertained by the officers on the other side as to Sidney." "No," said John, "I don't think it is so very strange. You shouldn't think it strange either, I think." Which Charley thought was very true. The rest of the winter was spent, in this section, peacefully enough. The troops went into winter quarters; John Prince quartering with Charley Montgomery. They frequently received letters fromn home, and among others that came was one to Cllarley Montgomery ad- dressed in a hand that he didn't recognise. Following that inllulse that leads one to speculate on an unopened letter, Charley handed the letter e John, and asked if he kpiew the Dcnmanship of the address. "No\,I do not," said John. Examining the postmark, he said: * It has the Chicago stamp upon it. Who do you know in Chici(ao? "I haven't a single acquaintance in the place," answered C1lhal 1y. "Strange, isn't it? I wonder who it can b)e fri9." And he turned it over on one side, and after scrutinizing that, turned it to the otler side, and examined that. "I guess the best way would be to open it," said John. "You Imay discover in that wa?" "True enough," said Charley, and then he performed the act tlhat almost everybody else does after they have found that they can get no solid information from the outside-he tried the insidle. Charley read down a short distance, and then jumped the rest and looked at the subscription at the end. "It's from Capt. Lawrence," said Charley. "Where is he; at Camp Douglass?" inquired John, both asking and answering the question himself.   "ETTER FROM HARROLD LAWRENCE.           1" "Yes," answered Charley; "and my mother lias been there." "What the mischief was your mother doing at Camp Douglass?" asked Jolin. Clarley kept on reading, and suddenly said, "Yes, and your sister Rose was there, too." Charley, if you are in earnest," said( JQhn, getting impatient, "I wish you would tell me wlhat your mother and my sister were doing at Callnlp Douglass." "O(, excuse me, John," said Cllarley, ("I really diln't intend to kee;l you waiting," and he htanded John the letter. It ran: -CAMP IDol0TLAss, CII cAC, March, 1864.

Co(.. (CI1As. MONTTGOMEiRY. "Tihere is something about that letter," said John, after reading it, "thht would plrodlce a good impression of the writer upon me if I Ihad never seen him."                   A . "I have a hgh regard for him, also," said Cllarley.  "And my fatler spoke very flatteringly of him." "I like the man," said John.  " lie seems to be-a manly, honor- able fellow. I liked him more and more as I saw him while he was ill our chlarge.." "Htow in the world did mother ever take it into her head that my 12   178   MRS. MONTGOMERY IN SEARCH FOR HER HUSBAND. father was in Camp Douglass, I wonder?" mused Charley, returning to the first part of the letter. "Some one has told her so, I guess," said John. "I'll soon get an explanation," said Charley, " for mother will write about it to me almost immediately upon iher reaching home; which will make her letter due me about the day after to-morrow." Charley's supposition was correct. The letter from his mother ihe got about the time he had expected it. She had heard, she said, that her husband had been captured at the battle of Lookout Mountain, and had been sent to Camp Douglass in Chicago. Filled with anxiety, she determined to visit the camp, and if possible, see her husband. r. Mr. Boultolln, she said, had kindly proposed to accompany her, anid Rose Prilice, also. Having reached Campin  Douglass, the Colonel in comland, after referring to the book, told her that no such name was oin the roll of prisoners at tlhat place "Noticing my look of disappointment," wrote Mrs. Montgomery, "the officer told me that it was possible thlat your father might be among the men in his charge, and( yet not have his proper name entered on the book. It is common, he said, for officers when cap- tured to lay aside their rank, if in undress uniform when taken, and giving fictitious names, have themselves entered as privates. He had no doubt, he said, that he could bring us ian officer who had come from the direction that I had been speaking of, who could give us some information about your father if there was any to be had there at all. So he sent for an officer nanmed Capt. Lawrence, who, when he came, took a very strong interest in my effort to find your father. He told me that he didn't think your father is a prisoner anywhere, but that he is in the army fronting you. This gave me a great deal of pain, which he saw, and you can imagine my surprise, when he told the that he had caused you as much pain y tlhe, very same intel- ligence. He consoled the very much in a talk we had, my son, on that topic that you and I always, from dread, avoided-your father and you meeting. He told me also about you taking him prisoner,n and he spoke in the highest terms of you and of Capt. Prince. His grati- tude was plainly evident. Ronse Price riace s much pleased at his kind words for John, and expressed the hope that the war would soon end, and that you and John Prince, and he might all be fast friends, an expression which he seemed to appreciate. He is a very nice gentle- manly man."   FRIENDSHP FOR THE SOUTH.          179 "Everybody seems to like him," said Charley to John, to whom he had been reading the above extract. "And it's not surprising," said John ; " he is all your mother says of him." "Well, old fellow," said Charley, " it may come, and sooner than we exipect, when we can all return home and be friends even with the men who are now aiming, day by day, at our destruction." John was thoughtful for a minute, and then said: "Yes; but, Charley, it isn't like as if it were a spiteful individual aiming of these Hen. We are aiming no less at their destruction, you know, than they are at ours; and, therefore, it will be as much of a sacrifice on their part, to be friendly with us, as it will riequire of' us to be friendly with them," "It will require no sacrifice on my part to be friendly with any of them that deserve friendshiip," saidi Cliarley. "Take Capt. Law- rence for instance." And John became thoughtf'ul for another short space. "htlit's a fact, Charley," he said, after reflection. "Captain Law- rence is a true mnan, really, and deserving of esteem." "Well; I'm going to write an answer to this letter,".said Charley. I have plenty of time now, and that's just the time to write a letter." . With inmpatience, Clharley and John awaited the coming of April, for about the middle of that month it was their intention to apply for leave so as to go home for the festivities in May, on the occasion of the marriage of John's mother to Mr. Boulton. But at last the month came. The dreary winter weather gradually gave place to the mild and beautifiul spring. The applications were sent in, sixty day leaves being applied for. Frank Blackwood, wlo had enjoyed so keenly his last visit to Prince's, was overjoyed at tl!e good prospect of an- other visit. The applications were granted, but not for sixty days. The com- manding officer considered it just then too much time to grant at once to officers, and thirty days had been substituted. "Why, that will give us scarcely any time to stay," said John Prince, with a very strong expression of disappointment. About tei days," said Charley; "it is not a very long, time to stay, indeed, John, after such a long separation." "I can fancy a case in which the officer to whom you would have applied, would consider it inadvisable to grant any leave at all," said   180          ANOTIE  VISIT HOME. Frank Blackwood, with a design of making the others more resigned to their short leave. And it had a very weighty effect that way. At last the day for their start came; and with glad hearts Charl'ey Montgomery, John Prince, and Frank Black wood started, andt their gladness increased as the distance between them and their destination diminisled. "Wont you be apt to astonish them at home, by your determina- tion to make a double wedding of this?" said Charley, as they were nearing home. "Oh, no," responded John. "I have arranged by letter so as to prevent anything of that sort. No, they are all prepared for it at home." The clattering noise of the train at last ceased, and they were in the town. "Here we are," said John, joyously, "and it's just the time of the day I like above any other-twilight. I'm disposed to walk to the house if you are, Frank. Charley will, of course, go home first." uI'm agreed," said Frank. "We need a little stretch after that ride." And accompanying Clharley as far as Bolultnl's, tlhey left hm to enjoy his reunion with Maggie alone, and continued their walk in the direction of Prince's.   CHAPTER XV. WHCH BRINGS WITH IT THE LONG LOOKED FOR CLOSE OF THE WAR. As John Prince neared his home, it was with difficulty that he restrained himself from atually running towards the house where he knew his nlother and sisters were. Frank Blackwood, breathless with the exertion he was making to keep ul with Joln, at last said, as the house appleared in sirllt: "John, there is the house; I remember, and with d(eep plleasure, the appearance of it as I parted from it the last- time we were hlome. There is very little change." "Very little," responded John, with an increased pace that threatened to relieve Frank of the little breatl he had left, "except that the house is plainer among, the trees; the last time \e wem were  you could scarcely see it from here on account of the thick foliage. The dear old place! Frank, you cannot, I know, appreciate the enjoyment of its dear old form as I do. But you can understand ny enjoyment when I tell you I was born in that spot." Frank with the picture of a sweet, loved face in his memory, said: "I do appreciate another glance at the old place, John; I would not exchange my pleasure this minute for promotion to the conmander inn chief." John half suspected Frank's reason for being so overjoyed at getting once more to Rose Cottage. "I am going back frorm here a married man, Frank," said he, more soDerly than he had been talking before; and, with a side glance at Frank, he added: " you are to be my groomsman." Frank asked a good many questions, all of which John answered to hiis satisfaction, until their arrival at the door of Rose Cottage pre- cluded further chance of conversation. With an eager bound John jumped up on the porch, and ran into the parlor, through the open door. He folded in his arms Carrie, whose face he saw at the window as he had passed. Hardly knowing 181   182          A HAPPY REUNION. who had her in his clasp, Carrie looked up into John's face, and with an exclamation of delight, threw her arms around. his neck. "Where's mother, and Rose and Lena?" asked John, eagerly looking out throlugh the hall into the drawing room. "Mamma is up stairs," answered Carrie, "and Rose and Lena are over at Boulton's." Up stairs John flew, and was soon in the affectionate embrace of his mother. This meeting was hardly over, when Mr. Boulton's carriage drove up with Rose and Lena in it, who inmmediately aligliting ran into the hlouse, and soon afterwards, into John's armis. Frank Black wood' had, as soon as John ran out, and up stairs in search of hiis mother, taken his turn inl greetingl Carrie Prince. Frank thought she had improved very greatly since he had left her. "Where's Susie?" asked John, after having given Rose and Lena a very brotherly hugging. "Here!" said a voice that made John's heart bound, and made himself bound, too; he had Susie in his arms in a moment. And happy as they could be were the entire party. Wo will go over, now, to Boulton's, to see what our friends there are doing. Mr. Boulton, and Charley and Magie, are sitting together. Maggie seems as happy as mortal can be in this world. Charley tells Mr. Boulton that he has heard of his contemplated change of lifit. "Yes, Charles," said Mr. Boulton, "I knew that John Prince would tell you. I often contemplated writing to you, to tell you of my intention, but I never got that tar. I wanted Maggie to mention it in her last three or four letters, but for some reason Maggie declined." And Mr. Boulton glanced at Maggie. "I didn't like to tell him," said Maggie. "I knew that Mr. Prince would tell him aunyhow, and that it was unnecessary for me to be writing about it; " and Maggie seemed not to have gotten' over that reddening process that was always her "failure." "Never mind," said Charley; "I know all about it anyhow, and I am really very much pleased, as I know John Prince is. By the way, did you know that John Prince was going to marry Susie before he goes back?" "His mother told me that she wouldn't be much surprised if it would be a double wedding," said. Mr. Boulton. "It certainly will be," said Charley; "and I am pretty certain that   "'NSANT&IAON S AT hOME.        183 Lieut. Blackwood would( be a great deal happlier returning if he could leave Carrie Princc Mrs. Blackwood when he leaves." "I suspected that much," said Maggie; "I have thought all day b, Carrie's manner and talk that it would come to that. Wouldn't it be nice if it would turn out a triple wedding?" Not this time, I guess," said Charley. "Frank would be satisfied, I know, but the arrangements are not all made. Now I guess after supper we had better go over to P'rince's. Unless John should get over here before we start."  "And that's not likely," said Maogie. Nor was it likely; for after suppler, John and Susie Montgomery walked out from the houuse and downi thie road, an(d before they returnled to the house, Magge anu Charley and Mr. Boulton had all arrivted. The nig!ht was spent as were all 'the otheirs betwcen that one atdd the oic of' the day on whichl Mr. BIultona and aIts.

Only, two or three days previous to the marriage, John was sitting in the parlor at his mother's, reading, wien a voice, vlwhich lie at once recogniized, spoke in a nasal, dl rawling" style: "Good iday, young man." ,John looked over to the witldow whch was up, land 5:iiantling before it, partly leaning into the room, was Rev. Samuel Cle1-o. "Good morning, sir," said John. "I lope you are very well." "I am in the enjoyment of that boutntiful gift of a merciful aind indulgent Father, Mr. Prince," spoke Rev. Clegg, in a sweet, thankful strain. "So am I," said John, resuming his book. Clegg left the windlow and came in, the door being open. "Is your happy parent at home?" lie asked, entering the room where John was sitting. John looked impatiently at the man, and answered, curtly, "She is." "Could you tell her that I would be plecased to see her?" "No, I could not," answered John. Clegg felt the rebuff, but he was not of a nature to be easily put off. "I have just heard," said he, with a most winning smile on Iris sallow countenance, "that your mother is going to have a little gathering    184  INTERVIEW BEa1iWEEN REV. CLEGG AND JOHN PRINCE. here on the day after to-morrow. She has invited Mr. Miller, the old gentleman who formerly occupied the pulpit which I now dis- pense the Word from, and I feel assured that if I had been at home when she called, I would have been fivored with an invitation to be presenlt." John felt partly alarmed at the thought of Clegg being present, and partly indignant at the man's DresumDtion. "I'll tell her when I see her," sai(d John, with an effort to (over his real feelings. "If I could see her nyself," said Rev. Clegg, "I erlhaDs "- "But you can't see ler yourself;" said J0ohn, gettilg anigr. "I tell you Hwill mention to her tlat you were here, a(d if she elio es to send you an invitation to be present, all right." And Jlohn pri- vately mnade up his mind that he'd take good care it slould be all. wrong. "I haven't heard exactly what the design of the gatherin is," said Clegg, clhalging his tactics. Then looking at Join with : glance tlat was intended to be sly, lie sa'id : But I suslpect, all pretty accurately, too, I presume. It is not well for man to be alone, Mr. Prince," he said, with a deep sigh. "Sometimes it is," said Johln, pointedly. Clegg winced, and the smlile lie had assumed died away. Soon1, however, ihe recovered his pious expression, which consisted primalci- pally in drawing downI the corners of his mouth an1d looking very meek, generally. "My soul, Mr. Prince," said lie, enthhusiastically, ' expllds mlore when I stanld before two loviln heartst tht are seeking tie bls'.s:ilg of an indullgeiit filther on their utlion "-  "Yes," broke in John, rather drily, and Cleg was agaill brought to a stand still. "I am inclined to think," said Cleg, resuming, with a great eflort, his smile and ministerial expression, "that you are about to take lntot) yourself a partner of your joys and sorrows," and he looked benign- antly and lhalf patronizingly at John. "Mr. Clegg," said John, rising and confronting the Reverenld manl, from whose face the smile and sanctity of expression now rapldly faded, "I consider you just a little impertinent, and you will, I h1op), excuse me for my plainness in telling you so. You are intruding your opinions and suspicions upon nme in a manner tlat is very dis- tasteful to me."   THE INTERVIEW CONTINUED.         185 "I am sorry, Mr. Prince, that I have wounded you," said Mr. Clegg; ' you mlisunderstand me." No," said John, emphatically, "I do not misunderstand you. I understand you to suppose that I am about to be married, and that you would like to perform the ceremony for me. Am I correct?" "You do appreciate ny desire more truly than I would expect," answered Mr. Clegg, with his old smile rapidly overspreading its pious underground ; "I would, most assuredly, not have any objection to perform that blessed service for you; on the contrary, as I said before, my very soul always expands to its utmost witl a sensation truly holy, as I stand in the presence of two handsome and loving  ones, who are, by my service, to be transformed into one person as it were." John had been surveying the miserable fellow with a mental calcu- lation, as to how big tis soul would be when it we,; swelled to its greatest size. \When' Mr. Clegg lad finished, John q ictly said: I have already madle mny arrangements, Mi'. Clegg." " ith Mr. Miller?" le asked. "It does not matter a great deal witlh whom," saild ;ohn; "I have completed the arrangements as to a clergyman." "Sometilmes," said Mr. Clegg, going on a last cli;h e with all his force-" sometimes two clergymen are plresent t at cq mony of tiis kind, one assisting the other, you know." (One will be enough for us," said John. Mr. Cletgg musedl for a while, and then, getting up ) go, he said. "You say that your mother is not in, Mr. Prilnee?" "No, sir," said John, "I said nothingt of the kind." "Then you intimated that I could not see her, just n w," he added, with some suspicion about Johnl's meaning. "I ami p)retty certain about that," said John, taking up his book and beginning to read, "she cannot see you now, she is rngaged." "If I could see Miss Rose," said Mr. Clegg, lesitatiL sly, and with his eyes cast down on the carpet. ' Which you can't," said John, laying down his bo k again and going over to Mr. Cleg. "And I want to say to you, iir," lie went on, getting excited as he proceeded, that the less you mention my sister Rose's name, and the less you come around here pestering my mother and sisters, the better it will be for you." "I am very much pained and surprised by your rude remarks, Mr. Prince," said Mr. Clegg, getting rather scared than anyt hing else.   186        RESULT OF TIlE INTERVIEW. "Well, cease your intrusions here, sir," said John, meaningly, "or you will be still further pained, if not surprised; " and John, leaving Mr. Clegg, resumed his chair and book. Mr. Clegg went as far as the door, and turning towards John, said: "Mr. Prince, it is only my respect and esteem for your mother an(d sisters, that prevents me from shaking from mry shoes the dust of my just anlger at your thres- hold. But, I will not do it; I will pass over this insult on your mother's account, and on account of my afl;ection for your sis"- Stop!" shoutced Johln, with a force -that made Mr. Clegg bounce. "Go on, sir, on your Way, before my indignation rises higher; it' it was not fbr your g:rb, I would Ihave kicked you hence long ago. Go "Onow, or, perhaps), I wuld not consider that clotlh you disgrace as any further Droteetion fir y(ou." And John, withi quivering lip and excited tone, lhurried the Reve- rend man from the hotuse. His mother he told of wlhat lhad occurred, and Mrs. Prince ex- pressed satisfaction that it II:d c(onic to just the )pass it dlid ; " fir," aid sier, uI could put up 'with him, but his annoyance of Rose is more serious." "If I had known the whdole trutlh," said Johln, "he would doubt- less have gotten sole of the dli Ist from ilyi shoes oi I his c(at tails." Mris. Prinec was, of conurse, glad that it hadn't gone that fir, but she was sincerely pleased at the anticipation of' a relief from I is inltru- sions for the future. A beautiful May morning it was-tlhe morning that was set apart lor the nuptials of' the two iiappy coilles. By oimm on agreement the ceremolny was to bl perfoirmced at the house of the Princes'. Frank, in a new and beautifil uinifor, stoo(d ip) as the " besct man  for both eouplles, while Carrie Prince, as bridesimaid, was Frank's lovely partner. Again the carriage of Mr. Boulton drove to the door, and again Charley went out, with his mind filled witlh tender recollections, to assist Mr. Miller from the carriage into the house. The old gentleman was v ery feeble. Hie could scarcely totter into the house, even withl Charley's assistance. "I hardly expected," said Mr. Miller, (" when I last had the sincere pleasure of leaning upon your arnn, that I would live this long. I amin fast fading away, Mr. Montgomery." "Oh, you must not think of that yet, Mr. Miller," said Charley, cheerfully.   A DOUBLE WE1DDING.         "  187  "I do not think of it reluctantly, Mr. Montgomery," said Mr. Milleri; "I rather look joyfully upoiiiiy near release fi'om this wor!, ' an1d nmy reunion above with the many dear, dear loved ones th:t, oi:. by one, have jgone from mne and left ie aln." Havinrg . sat down in the parlor, Mr. Miller ceased this conversatiri, which, lie well knew, was not the very best thalt could be chosen fir suchl a time.  When the two couples stood up before him, Mr. Miller, leaning on lharley Montgomlery, performied the ceremony. After having finished, he wisiled a blessing ulpon thloen. After spending the evening of that day with the othters of the happy party assembled at his house, Mr. Boulton, accompanied by his newly wedlledl wife, started the following day fbr a visit to New York. As they would not be back before the departure of Joliii, Clharley and Frank, they bade the tlhree an aflectionate farewell before they left. The remainder of tlihe time was spent by thie tlirce officers very ileasantly, and with a great d(eal less iintercourse between each otlher than oml their previous visit, for Charle and Ilis wife, and( Jo ln and his witil, and Frank and his wife that was to be, Carrie Prieice-for Firank and Carrie hiad come to a pretty fiill understanding that at a ne:r day, they should be married-l-kept a kitnd of close communion issO(ialtion with eacli othiier. \Worse than ever was the pain of tlhat fast approaching parting Ictwcii Charley and Maggie, and John andI Susie. Frank Blackwood, too, amid Carrie Prince felt ticir reluctance to separ'ate, very decided. Frank's best consolationm, as it w'as that of the others, Vwas the ,.iccringr assurance, tlhat the war mist soon end. \We will spare the readler the depressimg scenes of the final departure of' the three young officers for their respective commands, after their leave liad expired. Mr. Boulton's carriage, which had done good service in making Frank and Carrie grow closer in affection, during the many pleastant drives they lihad taken in it, conveyed the friends to the depot; they took tlheir places in the car, and soon were rapidly leaving behind t!e place that contained the loving hearts, whose pulsations were now saddened by the separation. At the first post they arrived at the officers were informed that their commands had left Knoxville, and that tlichey liad better report at Washington. Thither they went, and attached themselves to their separate commands.                   '   188        THE WOUNDED AND DYING. That summer, fall and winter, and the following spring, they had their share of the Potomac campaign. Through it, they and their men behaved with bravery and gallantry. At the battle of the Wilderness John Prince was wounded, by a piece of shell, in the left arm. His whole arm was torn and fractured, and he was sent to the hospital at Alexandria, Va. In this place his arm was amputated, and it was some weeks before he was allowed to leave his bed. One day, before he was able to be up, an officer was carried in and placed on a vacant bed close by John's. Calling one of the attendants, John asked him to ascertain wlIat the name of the officer was. In his return the man said that the officer's name was Lieut. Costello of the Montgomery Scouts. John was very deeply grieved to find poor Costello down, too, and he was still more deeply sorry to learn that Licut. Costello's wound was a serious one. As soon as he was able to get up lie went over to the bedside of Lieut. Costello, and taking him by the hand he said  "Lieutenant, I amn very sorry to find you hlere; but I will have to stay here some timen yet, and mnay be I'll have you back with met." Lieut. Costello pointed to the wound in Ills head, and said, sadly: "Captain, I guess I'll never go but one way. This will finish me." "Don't say that," sait John, nearly crying, "I am sure you will come all right in a little while; " and then holding up his left shirt sleeve, John said: "I have had a serious time, you see, but I have got first rate; you will be first r:ate, too, in a ifew weeks." "No, Captain," said Lieut. Costello,'; who was quite wekl;, "I will never leave this bed alive, I firmly believe. I ant-sorry-that yoll -have  ee nn  e:aiimed." Jloln seeing thatt it was with difficulty that Lieut. Costello talkedl, took his l:hand1 again, and pressing it, said( "Don't try to speak, Lieu- tenant." And a tear droppced from John's eye on the poor man's hand. Lieut. Costello felt it, and looking tip into John's eyes, gratefully, said  "Captain,-I wont-be long-here-pray for me." With many a tear now following the first, John, holding the hand of Lieut. Costello, did pray for the eternal' happiness of the faithful soldier who was dying before him. That afternoon, while the surgeon was at his bedside, Lieut. Costello asked for John, and the surgeon wlhispered to one of tire attendants that John should be sent for, that the man 4as goin' no .   'DEATH OF LIEUT. COSTELLO.        189 John came, and leaning down close to Lieut. Costello's face to catch his words, lie listened for the last few remarks that the dying man would make. With a great effort, the Lieutenant said: "Captain,- I a:i going-going fast. I want you-to tell Col. Mont-gomeery- that Hremembered him. God-bless him-and--you,-and tell-" Hetire his strength failed him, and closing his eyes Lieut. Costello was fr a wliile silent. After a little while lie again opened his eyes, antl fixed them on the broad white bonnet of a sister who was kneeling at hiis bedside with a tumbler in lher hand. Gradually he recognized John Prince again, and resuming as thougth lie were simply continu- ing Ihis cha:rge to John lie went on-" and tell-Liceut. Blackwood,- I remembered him." "I will, Lieutenant," said John, as well as he could, with a voice completely broken with grief at the death of the brave fellow. "God bless you," said the Lieutenant, " and all of the boys; " an(d then he sank raplidly until at last John was aroused by the words of the surgeon, "he is dead." He was, indeed, dead, the brave officer, the faithful soldier, the true honorable man. Lieut. Costello was no more. After the burial of the departed soldier, John thought seriously of resigning; but, eventually, the brave fellow concluded to rejoin his company. He found his company in command of Lieutenant Blackwood, un- der General Butler, in front of Petersburg. Charley Montgomery he learned was with Sheridan's cavalry in the Valley. John delivered Lieutenant Costello's message to Frank Blackwood, anod wrote to Charley informing him of Lieutenant Costello's death at the Alexandria Hospital, and: of his dying words. Thle men in the company were deeply grief-stricken at Lieutenant Costello's death, for he had been a great favorite. Kindly and generous in his intercourse with the men, faith- ful in the performance of his duty, and brave and gallant as a soldier, his loss was regretted sincerely by the whole company. Frank Blackwood was also wounded severely in several places in the battle in front of Petersburlg, but none of his wounds necessitated his transfer to the Alexandria Hospital. The long-looked for day, the fall of Richmond, at last dawned. The troops marched into the city from different directions, and before long Charley Montgomery met John Prince. They had been seeking each other. Charley was surprised to-see John's empty sleeve. "Why, I wrote you about my loss," said John; "and about Lieut. Costello's death before I left the hospital."   190          "MUSTERED OUT." "What!" said Charley, "Lieut. Costello gone? Surely you are not in earnest. But I know you would not jest on such a theme." "It is only too true, Charley," said John, sadly; "I was by his side when he died." "I am at least glad of that," said Charley; "it must have been a consolation for him to have had you witl him when he died." "I believe it was," answered John. He gave Charley a full ac- count of the wound of the Lieutenant, and of his death. "I am anxious to make search for my father," said Charley; "I know that if lie has not been hurt, he is about here somewhere among the prisoners." "Let us go, then," saidl John, "and look hilm up." And off they went, and, after inquiry, were directed to the proper place to find General Montgomery. Charley's father was talking to Capt. Lawrence, when the two young officers reached him. Clarley hurried off to his father, and he not seeing him approach was somewhat surprised wheln, turning around to see whose hand liadl taken his own, lie foundl his so standing before him. Charley told his father atil Capt. Lawrence-who had fallen into a conversation with John Prince-that lie wished lihem to both go home with him and John Prince, wh1en the order to " muster out" would come. Both gladly accepted the offer. General Montgomery was impatient to see his wife, and Capt. Lawrence had not forgotten a sweet face that he had seen at Camp Douglass. "I have just been paroled, and so lias Captain Lawrence," said Charley's fathler, "'and so it cannot come too soon." Charley invited his father and Captain Lawrence to stay at his quarters until " mustering out" orders sliould come. Upon arrival at Charley's quarters the anxiously expected order "mustering out" had come, and with hearts beating hghl with pleasure and happiness the little party of Union and Confederate officers started lome. Along the route there was an enthusiastic rejoicing that Geineral Montgomlery and Capt. Lawrence felt was not for them. But it did not decrease their pleasure.   CHAPTER XVI. WHICH IS THE LAST, AND IN WITICII TIIE READE;R SEPARATES, AT LEAST FOR A WHLE, FIOM TIlE ACQUAINTANCES MADE IN THS BOOK. THE reader can easily conceive the hanppiness that was caused by the appearance of our little party upon their reaching their respec- tive destinations; for although they all started for the same place, yet they did not go to the same places. John Prince, taking with him Frank Blackwood and Capt. Law- rence, went. to Rose Cottage. Cllarley Montgomery, with his father, went to Mr. Boultoln's. Wlln Maggie learned that Charley was "home for good," she did just what all the other female frieids and relatives of the soldiers did--nearly flinted with joy. Getting Mr. Boulton's carriage, Charley not waiting to wash hinm- self or to do anything else, drove over to Prince's for his mother and Susie, and getting them into the carriage, he drove back to Mr. Boulton's. Upon their arrival they were re-united to their father, to the most intense satisfaction aldd joy of all. To the sorrow of some of them, however, Mr. and Mrs. Montgoncery decided on an immediate trip home to their plantation in South Carolina. They were both de- lighted with the marriage of their son and daughter, and secured a promise that before long they should be visited by the entire party. Mr. Boulton, shortly after Charley's return, said to him: "Charles, I have bought the two sections adjoining my own, and have had shafts sunk upon eaclh of them. The present prospect is that they will both prove as good as my first." "I an delighted to hear it," said Charley. "But it will make it rather laborious for v n1, though, after all; wont it?" "I was going to say that I will have to have some competent person to superintend for me," said Mr. Boulton. "I will tell you your very man," said Charley. "Frank Black- Wood is as smart a fellow as you could find. He will be marrying Carrie now pretty soon, I suppose, and it will just suit him." 191   19a      NEW PROJECTS AFTER THE WAR. "I am very willing, I am sure," said Mr. Boulton; "I like him personally, and liked him the first day I ever saw him." "So does every one else," said Charley. "He is a good fellow." Frank was spoken to about the arrangement, and said hle woulld do the best he could. Having now a certain means of livelihood to depend upon, and withollt leaving Carrie's holme, Frtank brought matters with Carrie to a close. Carrie's mother objected for some time, but what with John's arguments, the consideration of hler daughter's happiness, and the general good opinion of Frank on every side, she finally acquiesced. Capt. Lawrence, wlo lproved to be a wealtly man, notwithstanling his soutlhern losses-for lie owned a large amount of property on tile north brancll in Chicagra--got along very rapidly witl Rose Priince who was really very fHvorably impressed by Capt. Lawrence at tleir meeting in Camp Douglass.  Another double wedding was to be celebrated, this time between two sisters, Rose and Carrie Prince. Charley said to Lena lrince, one evening just before the wedding, "Lena, you are left quite alone." "Oh, I guess I won't be lonely, as long as I amain the midst of all of you, Charley," said Lena.  "No, no, I don't mean you will be lonely," said Clarlcy, "I mean that here we are all- married but you. Ilowever," he said, loo;king at Lena, admiringly, " if you don't follow us Iretty soon, it will be- because you are determined not to."   I Lena had changed very much from what she had been when Charley first saw her in the door way when lie came to Prilice's, now more than four years ago. Those four years had prbduced a great change in Lena. She had grown tall and girlisl, but yet she retained hler sweet childish expression. Among them all there was not a prettier girl than Lena Prince. "I guess you will want Clegg to perform the ceremony for you, wont you, Frank?" asked John; " you are fastidious." "No," said Frank, a little more seriously. "I would like Mr. Miller to marry us, since he married you and Charley. I have been over there twice to see him. He is not able to leave his chair. The poor old gentleman is very weak." "Well, what are you going to do?" asked John, now serious himself; "surely, you are not going to let that hypocritical mounte- bank Clegg marry you."   ANOTHER DOUBLE WEDDING.         19. "Oh, no," said Frank, decidedly, "not by a very large deal; we purpose going over to the humble room of Mr. Miller, and being married there." "I'd rather be married by Mr. Miller in a cellar," said John, " than be married by Clegg in a palace." "So would we," rejoined Frank, "and that's the reason we are going over to his house. John, I want you to keep Clegg away from that I rionm for me," said Frank. I'll do that with pleasure," said John. "He has a room at the same pasonnge, said F rank, '"and Mr. Miller says that he hopes I wont mind if Mr. Clegg annoys me a little. Mr. Clegg, he says, is a little peculiar in his way." Then; quite earnestly, he added, " but I don't want that peculiar fellow to put in his oar at all." "Which I'll take care he doesn't," said John, assuringly. In Mr. Miller's room on that beautiful summer morningl Calt. Lawrtncem with Rose Prince leaning upon his arm, and Frank Black- wood with Carrie Prince leaning  upon his, stood before the aged minister who, too weak to stand, sat in his arm chair while he per- formed the ceremony. It was an impressive sight. That old man almost leaning over his own grave, starting those fbur light-hearted, happy young people on their journey of life as husbands and wives. Mr. Boulton alid his wife, and Charley, with Maggie, and his sister Susie, one on each arm, stood behind the happy party that were to be united. Lena Prince, looking carmin c ng, was bridesmaid for both sisters. John remembering the injunction of Frank, took occasion to beckon to Rev. Samuel Clegrg, who, hearing the many feet on the stairs of the usually quiet parsonage, I had loolked from his room, and(, sceing the party entering Mr. Miller's room, had followed and entered after them. Jolln, going outside, beckoned to Mr. Clegg, and that gentle- nman seeinog a kind expression on John's face, thought possilly that he was going to be invited to perform the ceremony, or at least, to assist in its performance. Going out to where John was, he looked at John with an air of expectancy. John walked softly over to-the still open door of Mr. Miller's rorn, and closed it. "What did you wish to say to me Mr. Prince?" asked Mr. Clegg. "I was going to invite you to stay out here with me," said John, quietly, "I don't like to stay out here by myself." 13   194  SHARP ENCOUNTER BETWEEN CHARLEY AND CLEGG. "Why do you stay out here at all?" queried Mr. Clegg. "We shall miss the ceremony, which I suppose is the cause of the presence of so many of my friends this morning in Mr. Miller's room." And Mr. Clegg now smiled knowingly at John Prince. "Yes, there is a ceremony going on," said John, not in the least disturbed; "H guess Mr. Miller is about at it n " "Why, the poor, dear old soul is altogether oo weak to exert him- self," said Mr. Clegg, horrified at the bare jea of Mr. Miller over- exerting himself. "I guess I had better aeast assist him." Oh, no," said John, coolly, "I guess not; they are pretty nearly through iow. It's cooler out here in the. entiy, and there are so many in that little room already." "Oh, I must go in, Mr. Prince," said Mr: Clegg, getting uneasy; "I would like to be beside Mr. Miller while he is performing the ceremony; I am sure he will need me." "And I am sure he wont, Mr. Clegg," said John, catching hold of the arm of Mr. Clegg, who was advancing towards the door of the roonm.  "I don't understand your conduct, Mr. Prince," said Clegg, get- tilg really angry. "I wish to go into that room; why do you detain me?" "Because you have no business there, sir," said John; "and be- cause, if you will know, one of that party most interested desired me to keep you out of the room, if practicable. And I consider it quite practicmele," said John, with a meaningness that Mr. Clegg couldn't but underst(and. "I can scarcely believe, Mr. Prince, that any one should give you a commission of that kind," said Mr. Clegg, now fast becoming a man of the world, and waxing wroth. "You don't mean to say you doubt my word?" said John, with his eyes flashing. "Not exactly that," stammered Clegg, cowering before the flashing eye of John Prince. "But-H-" "I--what!" exclaimed John. "I told you that some one in that room told me to keep you out of it; which I am certainly going to do, and you say you don't believe it, what do you make out of that, sir?" "I didn't intend to convey any doubt of your word in what I said, Mr. Prince," said Clegg, getting conservative. "I merely wished to express surprise that any one would be so uncharitable, so unchris-   SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS.         196 tian as to desire to keep me from 4he room, that is really more mine than any one else's, except Mr. Miller's." And Mr. Clegg became very sorrowful, but withal, forgiving-looking. That's his own business," said John ; " mine is merely to see that his wishes are respected," and he gave his one arm a graceful flour- ish, that took the last bit of determination to enter the room out of Clegg's head. "It was a he, then, was it?" said Mr. Clegg, "that wished me kept out of his gracious presence?"  "No matter about that," said John, who didn't like the taunting air assumed by Mr. Clegg. "It was desired, that's enough." "Very good," said Mr. Clegg, with his old sanctity of expression coming back to his face. He retired to his own room again, and closed the door thereof. John entered Mr. Miller's room, and found the ceremony over, and the venerable man expressing his gratitude to heaven for being spared to add to the happiness of those before him, by the part he took in the ceremony. The happy party returned to the house of the brides, where there was a fine wedding breakfast partaken of. John had to explain his absence from the room during the performance of the ceremony, which explana:tion caused those assembled at first some indignation that Mr. Clegg should attempt to intrude himself, and afterwards a great deal of amusement, at the way in which John told them of the scene in the entry. And now, the reader of tlis book has seen the happiness of most of the acquaintances made during the journey through it, completed, ani so for the present we will soon leave them. Mrs. Prince having gone to live at the fine residence erected by Mr. Boulton, Rose Cot- tage was taken charge of by Joln Prince and Susie, and fo(r a time Frank Blackwood and Carrie remained with them. Soon, however, Mr. Boulton erected two very neat cottages near to his own house, and one of them was at once occupied by Frank Blackwood, who be- cane bookkeeper and general manager for Mr. Boulton, and soon took from the old gentleman's mind the burden that his growing business was rendering too heavy for him. Capt. Lawrence moved with Rose to Chicago, where he owned a great deal of valualle property in a location that had increased three- fold in value during the war. Charley Montgomery, after a great deal of corresoondence had \   196          REMN'ISCENCES. passed between Capt. Lawrence and himself, decided to go to Chicago, and engage in the commission business, and John Prince, as his part- ner, went with him. The two young friends soon built up a very fine business, and before long were quite comfortable as to pecuniary circumstances. One day towards the close of the year 1865, Charley Montgomery anrrived at Rose Cottage. He had come to bring Lena on a short visit to his home in Chicago. Lena was delighted, and got ready to go at once.  Charley went over to sec Mr. Boulton, and while there told Mrs. Boulton of Lena's visit to Chicago. "After staying a week or two with us," said Charlcyi "shle will come back to spend Christmas here, and she will be accompanied by myself and Maggie, John and Susie, and Ilarrold and Rose. We will have a happy, merry Christ- "I shall be so happy to have you all around me once more, and above all other times in the year, I should prefer Christmas," said Mrs. Prince-Boulton. And Mr. Boulton was equally pleased.- Char- ley stopped with and saw Frank Blackwood, and( he, too, was overjoyed to hear of the proposed reunion of all the friends. Taking Lena with him, Charley got on the train to Clicago, and all along the ride to that place they were busy with a talk that was most grateful to Clharley. "Do you relmember our first mleeting, Lena, dearie?" asked Charley. "Indeed, I do," replied Lena, "'as well as though it were but a week ago." "Do you remember what you said to me the first night I staid at your house?" asked Charley. "What was that ?" asked Lena. "Don't you recollect when I was bidding the rest of the family guod nigh(rlt ?" "Oh yes," said Lena, getting very red, " I asked you to kiss me good nlight. There was nothing wrong in that, I hope," she added, getting still redder. "Wrongr iLena," said Charley, looking affectionately at her; "you can never know how that touched my heart. Until I lose my life I will never forget those words."  And then, laughingly, ie said: "Why, pet, you are goig on just as you usedl to remark my1 Maggie did, when she was spoken to; you are saying nothing, but just getting re(l. This didn't make Lena's complexion any lighllter, and Charley ceased and changLwe tle conversation to another theme.   A HAPPY CHRISTfaAS.          197 Maggie and both of Lena's sisters wer'e very much pleased to meet her. Lena spent a very pleasant time for a week, and then the whole party got-ready to accompany her home, and charming anticipations of their reunion were theirs. They arrived on the day before Christmas, which was remarled by Maggie to Charley as being the very same day and about the time that he and John Prince got home, just four years before. You didn't lknow, though," said she to Charley, " the intensity of my joy at your arrival.' "Neither did you know the intensity of mine, darling," he answered, "we were both a little in the dark as to each other's thoughts on that sulbject." "We found out pretty well since, though, didn't we?" she said, smiling at Charley. The look that she got from Charley appeared to contain quite enough of an answer for her. Christmas eve was to be spent by the party at Rose Cottage, and Christmas night at Mr. Boulton's house. A happier party could scarcely be gotten together than that which gathered at Rose Cottage, on Christmas eve. They were all just as happy as they could pos- sibly be, both on that and on the succeeding-Christmas-night. As this is a pleasant way for them to be in when the reader bids them farewell, we will go over with the reader to-morrow-Christmas- night, and, after enjoying the happiness of the assemblage, we will leave them to their own enjoyment. The spacious rooms at Mr. Boulton's house are brillantly lighted up, and the same happy faced group that were at Rose Cottage last night, again gathers. First Mr. Boulton and John's mother come in. Mr. Boulton looks benevolent, and Mrs. Boulton looks proud, not in the offensive sense, but proud of her husband and of her children. Then, as the others come in, Charley and Maggie, John and Susie, Frank and Carrie, Harrold and Rose, one word, and one word only expresses their state; they are happy, truly happy. Lena is circulating around among them all, the petted and loved of each. After singing and dancing for a great part of the evening, the ladies were prevailed upon to part with the gentlemen, that the latter might have an opportunity of enjoying a cigar. We will now bid the happy hearted ladies good-bye-for, we will t,     198      "OUR GENERAL'8"POPULARITY. not return to them-and accompany the gentlemen to the smoking room. After taking a little wine, each lighted a cigar, and a general con- versation ensued. Soon it turned, naturally enough, on the war, and Mr. Boulton said: It is almost like a dream to me. And the least real part of it is the present position of our old fellow townsman, Hiram Sidney." "Yes, he has a pretty high position," said Charley, "and I'm sure, although the rest of the war seems real enough to me, his elevation does seem like a dream." ' Well, as to the reality of the war," said John Prince, taking a long breath, "it certainly seems real enough to me," and the poor fellow caught his left shoulder with his right hand. "But, like Charley, there, ' Our General's ' elevation seems like a perfect night- mare to me." "With few exceptions," said Capt. Lawrence, "your papers here are crediting him with being the preserver of the nation," and the Captain smiled. "It's the newspapers that have put him where he is," said John Prince. "Correspondents that wouldn't go within five miles of where there was a little smoke, would write home glowing accounts of Sidney's bravery. How the accounts they wrote came to, be so particularly glowing, I guess Sidney knows as well as, if not better than any one else." "I read a paper there in Chicago," said Frank Blackwood, "that never mentions him by name, as we didn't use to, you know,"b he said, looking first at Charley, and then at John,"only instead of calling him ' Our General,' they call him the ' Saviour of the Union.' " "And a very nice name, it is," said John Prince. "I guess if he had lost an arm or a leg, they would have raised him up as a go(,  and would have adored him.' "Hardly any more than they are doing now," said Mr. Boulton, sorrowtfilly; " there are thousands of people tht to-day worship that name, more than they do that of their. Maker." "They didn't fight under him, though," said Charley. "Those are the people who staid at home to 'run the civil branch of the Government.'" "They are in most cases strictly honest in their worship of the man, tlough, for all that," said Mr. Boulton. And in a great many cases they are not sincere or honest," said   SIDNEY AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.      199 Charley. "I tell you, gentlemen, what I said to you, and what John said to you down at camp, Mr. Boulton, that those who have that puppet in charge are most keen-sighted fellows. Some of them, we know ourselves. They have him in clover now for something greater still." "You surely don't mean that they wish to put that noodle into the White House!" exclaimed Capt. Lawrence. "Precisely what I do mean," said Charley. "Everything loolk like it anyhow, you must admit. Since the days of Washington-. whose memory they outrage and insult by comparing Sidney with the glorious patriot-no man has ever been as carefully prepared as a presidential candidate." The discussion was participated in by all hands, until at last John a nd Charley, who had been close observers, convinced the others that Sidney was being prepared as a candidate. "They don't do it for Sidney's good," said John Prince, "they have no such 'generous' intention. No, no, they have a de p design in this enterprise. A whole army of adventurers are dependent upon its success." "But, it wont pay him, Charles," said Mr. Boulton, "to relin- quish permanently the position he now holds, for a four years' tenure upon an office that hardly pays enough to enable its occupant to make a presentable appearance." Charley laughed, and laughed heartily. " know you are looking at the thing with an honest pair of eyes," said Charley. "He not make enough!"  "There will be an army of millionnaircs made out of that army of adventurers that I spoke about," said John Prince, "if our opinions are correct, and, which the Lord forbid, the plan should succeed." "I hope as sincerely and as earnestly as you can," said Mr. Boulton, seriously, "that such a piece of wholesale swindling will never be consummated. I have very good reason to hope against it, you know." "Very true,'4 said Charley, and he related to Capt. Lawrence tlhe incident that occurred before Sidney's late army career commenced. "Is it possible," said Capt. Lawrence, " tlat the people can be so. gulled, as to believe him a warrior." "They at least believe him to be such now," said Mr. Boulton, "how long it will last is another thing." "And you will see that it will last long enough to suit his managers,'/ said John Prince.   200        PLOITINGS AND PLANNINGS. "I am assured that the late President," said Mr. Boulton, "had a very poor opinion of hinm.' "Yes, I heard something of that myself," said John Prince. "A travelling showman, who brought Gen. Tom Thumb to see the President, expected that honest old gentleman to express some sur- prise; but he, on the contrary, having just heard of ' Our General's' brilliantly conceived, and ably carried out plan of marching tche army overland to Vicksburg, said: 'Yes, that's a pretty small General, but I can beat him; I've got a smaller one than that! '" "Oh, John," said Mr. Boulton, laughng, "you are drawing on  your imagination for that. It's reasonable enough to be true, though." "You can ask Charley," said John, " if it wasn't current among the boys just after we came back from Holly Springs." And Charley confirmed John. i"But I really believe, the man would have sense enough to retain his present position, in preference to being used as a tool to enrich others." "But he wouldn't be allowed to retain his present position," said John Prince. ' Don't you see that if a change of admtinistration should  come, that if they get with it sufficient legislative power, Sidney : would be thrown out of his position with contempt and indignation? And if he doesn't do the bildling of his managers, why he is then in  as bad a place, for they would throw him out then, too." "As which party candidate do you expect him to come before the  country?" queried Capt. Lawrence. "Well, the Democrats couldn't very well take him," said John.  "But that's the trouble; they, also, are looking with loning eyes upon  him, as they know he would be a very satisfactory man for them. iHe keeps pretty quiet as to his personal politics, and so the Democrats 5 don't know for a certainty that lie wont do; so you see the conse(quence: both party organs, most of themn knowing better, are deliberately I puffing him up, ascribing to him a combination of qualities tl:at are  possessed by no man, not even by the best man in the land, land a  generous-hearted people are gulping it all down, and up goes Sidney  as a demi-god." "Yes, that prolably explains the unanimity of the press in speak-  ing well of him," said Mr. Boulton. "That isn't the worst of it;" said Charley Montgomtery. "When the time comes for him to step out in charge of his keepers, the papers that have lauded him, will, for obvious reasons, be very slow to   "ET US HAVE PEACE.           201 contradict what they have so positively declared of him. And so he will conie before the people as the proper recipient of their grateful favors." " rell," said Mr. Boulton, rsing, as did the others, for it was time they were rejoining the ladies, "I earnestly trust, that your fears are groundless. IBut, should they turn out correct, and his civil rule should correspond with his military career, he will prove the greatest curse that was ever visited on this land. And the condition of the country at the end of llis term, should he be allowed to rule for one, will verify my words." L E.T US Al VE PA C(y .   j!" J- -1   CONTENTS. CHAPTER I.
