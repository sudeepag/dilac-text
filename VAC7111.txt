District of New-York.

Tim drowsy afternoon of a sunny autumn
day, which had found its way into the Christ-
mas week of December by mistake.
In a quiet house at Number Seventeen,
One Thousandth street, iarlynburg, (a sub-
urb of New-York,) the drowsy afternoon
crept past before the eves of a benign-look-
ing middle-aged lady, in spectacles, and with
her needlework before her;
Mrs. Gentry.
The pussy-cat dozed in the corner, the ca-
nary slept on its perch, and the dog lay basking
in the broad path of sun upon the yellow
carpet.
Mrs. Gentry's needlework slipped silently
to the floor, her eyes closed, and she slept.
And -the brawny Ellen snored in accordance
mnthe kitchen; and the clock ticked drowsily
on the whitewashed wall; and all was som-
nolence and silence.
Mr. Gentry, tapping away with his little
hammer at his little watch-springs and trin-
kets of tiny brass, with his crutches erect
against the work-bench gravely looking on,
in the little back-room up-stairs, was hardly
noisier than the clock.
There came a click, as of a key turning in
a lock, followed immediately by the signal
lang ! of a heavy street-door.  The Prince
had arrived to blow the bugle-horn and wake
the inmates of the enchanted castle. Mrs.
Gentry started to her feet ; the pussy-cat
mewed lustily, and the dog barked and wag-
ged his tail with delight ; and the brawny
Ellen ceased snoring, and smiled, and put the
tea-kettle on. The canary jumped off its perch
and chirped merrily, and the clock fell to
ringing its five o'clock bell, and all was joy-

ful noise and activity in the house - for Willie
Gentry had come home.
Ile was a noble-looking youth, with broad
shoulders, well thrown back, and a head which
lie carried with the ails of a king. His hair
clustered in thick masses of soft, dark brown,
much the same as his mother's had been he-
fore time had increased the value of hers by
showering silver there. His hazel eyes were
playful and vivacious in expression.  The
high, fine forehead was of a mat whiteness,
equaled only by the brilliancy and purity of
Parian marble; and the deep carmine lips re-
minded one of some luscious tropical fruit,
whose red ripeness is beautiful to the eye :anl
staining to the touch.  his step was light
and elastic as that of a young fawn, but in
spite of this lie had not time to reach the little
drawing-room before his mother had tripped
out to meet hiiA, for her step was scarcely
heavier than his own
It was well the red lips did not stain-
for if they had, in what condition would
Mrs. -Gentry's cheeks and forehead have

" Mother, you're a trump," said the Prince.
Where's Pop ?"

your father by that frightful title?  lie is in
his snuggery.  But don't call him by that.
horrid name, will you, dear?"
"No, mother, I won't," he answered laugh.
ingly ; " I won't, I'll call him Daddy. Where's
Daddy ? Ah ! here lie cones I IIere's my an-

es. " Here's my Governor 1  My dear old

"I knew you were home, my boy," said
Mr. Gentry, seating himself, and laying his
crutches on the floor within easy reach,
"Something told me you had come. ~
What was it told you, father ?" asked
Will.
"Never mind, my boy. But if by any
chance you should think it was love, yoU
Won't he far wrong."
Will Gentry smoothed the few w hite hairs
on his father's forehead, stooping over it
fondly, and-again it was well that the red
lips did not stain.
" Tea's ready," said the brawny Ellen,
appearing at the door and laughing wildly
in Will's face, for no earthly reason except
that she was glad to see him.
It was a true American tea. Tiere were
slap-jacks, and pie, and molasses, and cake,
and tea, and yellow cream, and apple-sauce.
And plenty of every thing
Pop." said Will-and it Li sad to know
that ie spoke with his mouth full-"Pop, I
believe I'm getting quite dissipated."
Mrs. Gentry looked up in alarm,
"Don't frighten your mother, Will," said
his father ; "explain yourself."
Out till twelve o'clock last night at 31r.
Pearson's Christmas dinner--''
Oh ! interrupted Mrs. Gentry, " eh/ is
not dissipation-to go to a tristnas dinnter
at your employer's house-and very proud I
ant of his ligh appreciation of you, tny dear.
It is not every New-York merehaut would in-
vite leis book-keeper to a dinner at his house
in Fifth avenue. If that is all you mean by
dissipation, I am quite proud of it."
But that is not all."
"Don't frighten me~c, Willie,"1 pleaded the
mother.
"Don't frighten us, my son," said Mr.
Gentry.  "11onor your father and humor

your mother, that your days may be long in
the land."
You won't let a fellow talk," said the
young nan. " All I mean to say is this-I
am going out again to-ight."
" Where '.
" Ah ! that's the secret.  I give it you in
a thousand to guess what I have got on the
tapis for to-night."
"Tpis, dear," repeated Mrs. Gentry, cor-
recting the boy's pronunciation of the French
word.
"Well, tappy then,mother. Pop, what do
you think I've got on the tappy for to-night?"
-'I couldn't say, my boy. I couldn't pos-
sibly say," replied the elder Gentry, rather
regretfully, as though it were a matter for
lamentt that be could not divine his son's
thottghts.
Well,my new dissipation is, that we
should all go to the theatre to-night.''
"The theatre ! What theatre ?"
Haven't you heard ?'There is a great
moral (dratna to be given at Young Men's
Hall to-night.  And as it's Saturday nih r,
and we don't often get a chance to go to the
theatre here in IIarlynburg, I move we all
go. Shouldn't you like to go, mother.?''
" Yes, dear, very-tmuch;" answered Mtrs.
Gentry ; ''that is, if your father will go.''
" Go !  es, inleed ! It's only three blocks
ofl. I can      ttldislthat, e-ay ('nought.
Ave are all such stay-at-homue blies that it
will do us good to go out. And besides,
Will, we tntmt have sotme public spirit, you
know-we mr-St encourage home institutions
-and help to establish the drama in Iarlyn-
burg. There's a convincing argument--not
that argument is needed. I am old enough
to obey orders, ntd this rascal here is my
superior officer"  And the old gentleman
punched Will's ribs playfully with the end of
his crutch.

well found a mis-representative in the person
of a dark, savage, ruffianly-looking man of
past forty, who was in that highly salubrious
state of crockery-ware known as "his cups."
" Shall we go, Willie ?" asked Mrs. Gentry,
so soon as the curtain fell.
Wait for the allegory, mother. It won't
be long, probably."
The allegory consisted of a solitary female
figure, standing alone in the centre of the
stage, dressed in the traditional costume of
goddesses, and holding in her hand a very
large and very unwieldy flag 'and staff  A
solitary female figure, with short white skirts
and flesh-colored leggings, and an il-propor-
tion t and worse-sewn liberty-cap poised un-
steadily upon her heal. She was evileintly
the original of the thmi little colored photo-
graphic girl of the doorway dhsplay, whote
form had been rounded by the maturing touch
of womanhood, until it was now little short of
a perfect model of perfect beauty; She hal
long training golden locks, which himng inii n-
tdilous waves almost to her knees, and h, 
childlike blue eyes, that looked straight ip to
the clouds of heaven, seeminglyti, frott out
their pure and liquid depths.
A stage goddess-niervols, evidently, at her
position, and the knowledge that the eyes of
all present were turned upon her; ad w io
experietced, doubtless, a great sense of relief
when thit clrtaini fell, as it did soon, on her
and the allegory.

Two streets back of the street in wlich
Young Men's Hall gracefully lifted its proud
front, and kept it lifted-two streets back,was
a third street, as different from its bustling
neighbors which lay in close proximity as
though they were further removed than Styx
from Euphrates. A street so quiet and order-
ly and deathly still, that the air which bore
on it the noises of those neighboring streets
seemed to hold its breath as it passed. A
clean street,with clean sidewalks, clean, clerk-
like men, clean, sempstress-like women, clean,
school-going children, clean houses with

"A very unpleasant spectacle," said Mrs.
Gentry.
If it was I very unpleasant spectacle, how
dil it happen that Will Gentry arose, after
the curtain had fallen, with a filmyiy mist before
his eyes, and knew nothing until lie found
himself walking vacantly along the street with
his mother on his arni
Arrived at home, lie received in silence his
father's "God bless yoi, my hboy," and his
mother's kiss, and sped up to his own apart-
ment. He sat down silently, on the side of
his spotless little bed, and meditated long.
"I left this room three hours ago," lie sail,
lifting his head at last, " a bov-  I return to

a man who loves arc tuine. 0 mys goddess !"

That night there was an aitdded name n the
prayer which went up from    Will Gentry's
bedside - and when at last lie composed him-
self to sleep, lie dreamed that he was trant-
formed into 'a glorious antiliue-a: youthful
god of freedom; and that the beautiful godl-
dess of freedom, (formerly attached to the
great moral exhibition of the good Mr. Bag
glethiorpe,) with her white arms twinled lov
ingly about his neck, was seated on the hack
of an ioutpreath Anerieanm eagh- which was
slowly upwafting them both to paradise.

freshly-scrubbed wooden step , and, midway
of the block, a clean little church with three
trees in front of it, clean also.
Next door to the church there stood a
house which had a history.
Years ago, a gentleman doing business in
New-York, and whose position in life was
financially expressed by that ponderous ad-
jective "opulent," had bought some "house.
lots" in Ilarlynburg. For a length of time
his "house-lots" had remained without other
occupants than boys at noon-day playing at
ball, girls at sunset trolling hoops, and honje-

less nomadic animals at night seeking a spot
of shelter and of sleep.
nt there caine a change.   A house was
built on one of the lots-a fiiie house, a large
house, a suboirbailla, and the opulent gen-
tlen canseoutand lived there with his
opulent family , it they kept servants and
a carriage , and trieids visited tieii; and
altogether the sulburl) promised to become
dinnied-jately fashionable, and landholders'
were joyous at the prospect of future pros-
perit, aid positively refused to sell at former
p~riees.
Then there aiie another change.  clouds s
gathered on the sunny sky-the too -unniy
sky. llurr11 ig mtessengers went alter the
dtor - for die opulent wife of the opulent
gentle an had been taken ill, and in a shorter
space of time than you would think it p'ossi-
Ide to die in, -lie died. And the opulent
geulteuanhiusielf was down, and it was
rumored that -lie also would ,die; atnd ntix
opulent but thler bad-teumpered little gi-ls,
oI-pringof the  aoxe, uiere hastily remottixed
to sonio other llace-nio one knew exacth
where, ot they never returned to li arl i-
btr g.hill an  1 h ,the opulent genutulemtiani got
altit, and tIl pteopcle w Iho saw himii sI that

pearedl That his skit was wrinikled, now
blue by turit", now yellow,nowy gha-tly white
and thattt inoIe id-ays, wlen the sui was
liinini brightly aiid every body else was com-
plainiing of tie1 heat,'this strange opulent gen-i
tenant would shiver and shak e as if w it d
cold. And again, when the cold wind was
blowing about the corners, taking all per
sOIls w ral ptlt wx armily, antd stamp p their feet on
the ground to keep life in thlem, this strange
opileint gentleman w ould take oil'his hat and
invite thie isid to blow on his temples, and
supplicate the snOwilakes to melt on his
burning brow aid cool it. And soon after,
the opulent gentleman went away, leaving
his house to let at a house agent's, for the
lowest of " songs ; aiid the price of land
went down to the zero of the speculator's
thermometer ; for Ilarlynburg, poor Harlyn-
burg, paria-like llarlynburg, was now known,
and truthfully known, to be infested by that
pest of pests, the fever and ague !
But all this is now completely a thing ol
the past. Valiant drainage stepped in, and

friendly sewers laughed miasma to scorn.
The hand of reform was soon at work, and
at present, lIarlynburg is as healthy as any
suburb of New-York. But somebody once
gave a highly respectable dog a had name,
and it interfered w ith every subsequent
business operation of that unfortunate canine.
And every body said there was fever and ague
in lIarlynburg, and it militated against the
house-agents, and kept rents low.
And it was well for a certain Mrs. liapp
that rents were low, as otherwise how could
she have taken the great brick house-prop
erty of the opulent gentleman--m the clean
street iieet to the church, and opened it in
rather an ostentatious manner, n\ itli a little
tin sign nailed near the hell-pull, announleing
that this was now MRS. Rari's FasIIONAiiii.

It caine to' pass, however, when, little by
little the house tilled, that the appearance ot

there w: as of fahiioii in llIIarl ibii}g had a
house to itself, and did not seek to array it
tell' unid,-r the presumoptuous tin signbolard
at the Rapplm portal.
And the good Mr. Ilagglethorpe, casting
about for a haven of rest for himself mid lis
faiivilx, deliberated for many minutes before
daring to disturb the death like quiet of all
about in the clean street, by a pull at the hell
of the great brick house. Maiiy wre t'.-hesur
nises to which this signi gave rise.  MaNiy
were the qiuetion-, selfIdenianded, to which
Mr. Bagglethorpe, in his love for truth, in-
wardly, regretfully, answered in the negative.
Was lie fashionable ? No. Ie was good

dirt is now in New-York ; that immensely

brero of a Spanish muleteer, furnished forth
f indubitable proof of goodness, doubtless, but
of fashion-no.

Was Mrs. Bagglethorpe fashionable ? It
is true she often personated fashionable cha-
racters. The whole range of the drama,
from Lady Macbeth down to' Roxalana, was
open, and indeed had been penetrated by
her.  And penetrated, Mr. Bagglethorpe
thought, in a remarkably effective manner.
Therefore, in one sense of the word, she wis
fashionable.  A person who played Lady
Macbeth-a queen, in fact-must be fash-
ionable. But was that the style of fashion
which Mrs. Rapp demanded ? And would a
red cotton velvet robe, tritimed with tar-
iiishel gold lace, he the proper fashionable
costuie for Mrs. Rapp's boarding-house han-
pIclts ?
And Fifine-la petite ?  Alh! less thin
either of the others, could ite lay claim to
being a votary of the goddess of fashion, or,
indeed, of any goddess whatever, except tiat
very ill-cladone, that flag-hewrapped goddess,
wlomt she nightly pcrsoiatel at the great
moral exhibition. Little Fifine-a little, gol-
den-haired, blue-eyed baby when this poor
wandering couple had received her, with a
blessing on them and her, from the arms of
an unknown dying mother, departing this
life as cheaply as possible at a miserable
country inn, in some wretched village where
the exhibition was then-even at that remote
period-exhibiting with only qualified success.
'They had taken the child and cared for her;
and, by her own will, she had given then
her poor aid in return. Sie was beautiful
in form and feature, a model for the gods,
if the gods had been sculptors; but in  a
fashtiionalble sense, the good Mr. haggle-
thorpe felt her deficiency as uitich as liis
own.
lie had concluded, then, that there was lit-
tle o'r io isC in his applying at this forbidden
source of fashion, Mrs. Rapp's boarding-
house, when, by one of those strange acci-

govern the fate of nations themselves, the
door opened, and a clean, tidy, but poorly-,
clad woman issued forth with a basket on
her arm, which seemed to indicate is tenden-
ey toward that unfashionable but necessary
place of resort-market. Seeing the good
Mr. Bagglethorpe quite a fixture before her
house, (she had been watching him from in-
side for some minutes,) and feeling, in view

of his rather shabby raiment, a natural anxi-
ety for the safety of a coat and two hats
which hung suspended just inside her door,
she resolutely planted herself before him,
and asked peremptorily:
"What do you want?"
"I want," answered the good Mr. Baggle-
thorpe, rather astonished at her question,
but determined to answer it truthfully, " I
want a heap o' things. -In the first laceI
want a fortin, and a noo dress for Feefy;

what softened 1y the prospect of more lodg-
crs, "yes, I-'have a few empty, thought only'
a tew. Won't yout walk in, sir?  This way
please," conducting the good Mr. Baggle-
thorpe into a very large antd very barren
parlor. ,"'IT:wo rery fashionable ladies, the
Miss Millers, now staying at the Fifth Ave-
nue Hotel, wrote to me only yesterday for

the good Mr, .agglethorpe, feeling that these
wxere conditions with which Filine and Mrs.
IRagglethiorpe could scarcely comply'.
Oh I dear, nox; what ate you talking
aount ?  I mean the Miss Millers -but, it
you wish to take the rooms, I'll xvrite to

Very gladly, Mis Rip, very gladly. And
ant in much haste to be settled with my

would have preferred their being on the

"Yes, Feefy," would this good old soul say,
when safely installed at his home quarters
with his wife and his ward (as lie grandly
called her) sitting near hhn. " That there
young man, whose name deponent knoweth
not, he cane the very fust night, with most
an elegant lady hanging on to his arm, and
an aged gent beside them o1 cripples-i

there liev lie been. I know not who he is,
nor do I keer. Butt of I ketch hin throwing'
sheep's eyes at my little girl, I'll refuse hin
admittance to the egzibition."
"Cuardy," said the girl, "I have never
seen him throw any tiing at all at me, and
I'm sttre lie seems a very nice person."
"My dear, you i(b not know wat these yere
young men will do. Es a root, they air 'wick-
ed. A young ladyi pursooint' your perfe s'ion

vise her to it )so igntermini ous a pursoot.

" It is tl least I can do, Gi:irdv, to try and
aid you a little, after all your goodness to
me," said Fitine, nestling up close to the fit
old mian and looking fondly in his eyes; for
he was the only father she had ever known.
" My child, you are the darlingest girl that
ever lived. Idbless the day mue and the cgzi-
bition went to Pettyville, where I lost money
and had to pawn our clothes, for there I found
you. Your poor mother! How grateful she
wits to Nis Ilagglethorpe, wen Mis . said she
wul take the child. We told her wat we wuz,1

will be good to her, w91't you ? Says I, watt
is my name, mtarm ?  Says she, I donst know.
Says I, it is the good Mr. iagglethorpe.'
Do you know what that-that young
gentleman's name -is, Guardy ?" asked1Fifine.
"The young man that cones at might with
the remarkably fine complexion .,
"Yes, and the brown eyes," added the
young girl eagerly, "and the beautiful curly
hair."
itim as come the fust night with most an
elegant looking lady on to his arm ?"

" Ye-es." But her tone was not so buoy-
ant as before.
" I do not; nor do I wish to know. Why
should I?  Our paths air different. Let me
go soy way-him his'n. Above all, let him
leave you alone severely. lied better ! Ile
will find that you air an ernolaly."
"What is that, Guardy, dear? Nothing bad,
I hope ?" And the great blue eyes looked up
frightened.
"No, dear. It means that although you
air a goddess, you air virtoos. Most of them
goddesses wuzn't ; at least so I've licerd. Let
him keep his sheep's eyes to himself.  As I
sail afire, he'd better.
The door way opene lastily and Mrs. Bag-
'glethorpe, fat and breathless, it her head
iside.
"Why don't you come, you two .   Wel
le awfill late. Xotrindg tilt at half past seven
lptecisel1y now,11, din it yout PIggle ? It's seven
11mw, and smy black velvet hiod' is so tieht,
and it takes h11(11 a time to hooli it'."
They 'nent at once, for to le late at the
theatre was an iie\cisable tliing. They ar-
nved at the hall quite breathless. There was
no private entrance for the performers, anl
at the pulie entrance they found the hand-
some10 . tton itatn u aitinig oiuitide. He seemed
greatly eliharras-cid as they approached, l)it-
stod lsi ground, and Mr. \laggletlhorpe, as lie
passed, gave hon a scorching look, nearer an'
ger than one would have deemed fiose pudgy
old features capable of. - Mrs. iagglethorpe,
with the kntnledge that she had now only
about a quarter of an hour in which to pass
through the various stages which lav between
her present self and Quccnshiip, did not notice
hiltm, or indeed any thing whatever, except that
her good husband was a msonstrotus length of
time in scraping his feet on the lower step.
Will Gentry, gaming at the queer couple and
smiling slightly, did not at first look at Fifine
so that the girl had ample opportunity to silr-
vey hint at her ease. She felt sure this young
mian was not wicked ; that lie did not think
ill of her for standing there nightly on her
goddess-like throne to be stared at by the
gaping crowd.   Ile'knew it was necessity.
Do you not know it is necessity ? asked her
warm young heart, eagerly yearning to com-
mnune with his.
He turned his eyes on her now-those soft

brown eyes of which his mother was so proud.
She had uttered no sound ; he uttered none.
And vet her question was answered. He knew
it was Iecessity  lie understood lier and her
po ition -he respected her, he loved her ;
wouldlhe give him her love in return ? And
then and there she aid yes, and gave its, and
still there was nothing uttered.
All this oeeipied but a few seconds of time.
'he good Mr. IBagglethorpe, still frowning at

the voung mall, turned and, almost roughly,
pushed the goddess in. Unknown to line,
as she passed lby, the younmllii1:111 gently tulle-
ed her dress  ithi his hand ; and(whe1i shite
had gone and the 1oor had closed upon him,
shutting him oit in the street, Wllie lift id
his ingeri to his lips and tenderly k ssed them
at their tips where they had coie i contact
with his Peri's robe.

with the thumb of his left hand inserted in

"It is a thankless spear of life, my aspirin',,
young friend--a thankless spear ! Genus is
rarely reco'nised. Look at Mis Bagglethorpe.
Talent goes fer naught!    Look   at Lar

have looked at her until I am crazy !)  Be-
sides that, the art itself stands low. It hedn't
orter. It is a grand art. A noble callin'
As high in ev'ry way, ef not higher, than
paintin' and sculptoorin' and Iakin' photy-

Tread the boards at Young Men's Hall, in-

walking a plank. What would his mother
say to such an act as that ?-what his father ?
-what all Iliarlynburg ?
" Then wat T' said   Mr. Bagglethorpe
sternly.
" The truth is," stammered Will, hh ishi ng
fearfully at his awkwardness in treading the
devious paths of diplomacy, " what I wished
just at present was, to-a-take a few les-
sons in elocution and-a-that sort of thin,

I do not act,' said Mr. Iaggletlhorpe,
interrupting, and leaning back in his chair
Imajestically, "I manage.
" Ye " returned Will, " I am aware of
that. But perhaps-that is, I thought per-
haps one of the- ladies of your f ainly, both
so talented and beautiful," (and Willie, thmik-
ing only of Fifine, laid great stress on the
last word,) " night perhaps undertake, to in-
struct me in this difficult art."
Did you?" said Mr. Bagglethorpe stern-
ly, all the more sternly because he felt his

sympathies going out very strongly toward
this good-looking young man, with his kind
honest face. "Did you  '
"Yes, sir; and believe me, sir, any re-
muneration you might name I would cheer-
fully give."  And now it was Will's turn to
lean back- majestically in his chair, uttering
this Rothsehildian speech.
" I suppose I might speak to Mis Baggle-
thorpe about it," said Mr. B. reflectively.

"I'll see about it."

he had hidii'rfiil talent; and so perhaps le
had. lut the wonders of his talent were
directed im other channels than  those of
Thalia or Melpoimete. Thte wonders of his
talent had tmanifested themselves principally
in the art by which he had obtained a fiot-
hold in the poor hiotie of the Thelspiaiis-the
charmed irele where dwelt his beautiful
go~ddess.
his foothold was firmuu now-firimer perhaps
than he lutiaginled, or hua'l at firet dart-i to

"Well--yes." she answered    with sonic
hesitation, " rather pretty. I think any other
ptersot would enjoy it more than I.   The
truth is, it makes te wretched to see all

20            TiHE' GOOD .fR. BAGGLETHORPE.

Was it not like the scene in Romeo and
Juliet?  The old nurse at the head of the
stairs, and Romeo below with'his skates slung
over his shoulder, and Juliet with her beauti-
fl eyes bashfully bent down and shaded by
the small rim of her jockey hat !
"Well, you won't tell me," said Will, '" and
I must go. I see quite well how it is."
" How is it ?" she asked.
"'You don't care for me, and you don't
like to hurt my feelings by telling me so."
Willie, I-I-" staimimered Filine.
What, swecetlieart ? '1' what, Fify?'"
1 (b love you so 'uive," and then cane
the hot tears which she had kept restrained
all the evening, but which would flow now.
'' Dear little Fify !" he iurimured, in a low
voice. "You have made mue so happy by
this."
" You don't think I am immodest to tell
you so" she asked, blushing.
Iminmiodest ?" he replied indignantly. " Not
a bit of it. Immodest, indeed!"
Somehow, in his enldeavor to Iprove ti her
that lie did not think her iinnid-st, the
jockey hat fell to the floor, and the -waving
ringlets of 'the sun-tinged hair streamed over
the collar of Willie's gray overcoat.
" How much do you love miie ' lie asked.
A lucid question, this. Very popular with
infancy.
''Oh ! more than I can tell."
Not the proper answer by any means.
" Three bushelss,' is the orthodox reply.
"o miucl," she continued, in so Imw a voice
that Will was obliged to bend down his check,
till it almost touched her cherry lips, to catch
her words--" so much, that to-night when
that young lady skated up to us-the Turkish
one, you knon--and said you had flirted with
her at Mr. Pearson's dinner, I could scarcely
keep from crying. And 0 Willie! when
she said you had given her a pink Cupid-I
thought-my--heart-would-break !"'
Confound her !" said Willie indignantly.
" Come, don't erv, Fify, don't ! You know I
never can love any onebut you !"
" Truly ?"
"Truly " said Willie, touching her cheek
with his lips. But she was scared at this, and
moved away from him as though she were
afraid. She need not have been afraid of
Willie Gentry. The boy was as innocent as

herself, and the love which burned in both
their hearts was as pure as any earthly pas-
sion can be.
Will you always be true to nie ?" asked
lie.
" Always.'
"And always love me
" Always-always."   And again the bright
locks streamed over the gray overcoat. 'Tlic
were both too happy for words.
Voice from up-stairs
'iTie nurse agam.
"ood-iiigit, darling ! said Willie.
"c Good-night!"
Pirtig nx1as sweet sorrow. They muiighit
have said good-night until -thn moi row, but
the nurse would not let them. She 'called
"c I'/ ne !
" Good-night, sweet love."
food-niighlt, dear Willie."
Did Romeo kiss Juliet?     1'erhaps not.
ut Will ( entry did not trouble htimIself about
precedent at that iioiienit of parting.
Out in the street again, lie  alked over the
crisp snow with the proud air of a victorious
sovereign. Oh ! how happy Ie was! I.Iow
dearly, devotedly lie loved her!  is 1eauti~
fuil goddess! lie never could love another
woman, lie said to himsel; never.  le would
love her, and be true to her, man 1 -hie shulit tl
be his owna darling--his 0n eet, sweet little
baby -wife.
Yes, lie would marry her at once. To~
morrow or the next day, peraliills--or the
next, iontli. le would limr herI as soon
as possihle. Hm  happy he was
le was not well-oi' yet, triue. But lie had
his salary, and one more 1ersoi makes no
difl'erence in a hounseliold, (a sweet and popu-
lar lovers' error,) and ie would take his wife
to live with his father antd moth er, and they
xvould love her as they( lid him. How coult
they help loving icie ! His beautiful goddes!
Ilis sweet little Fifine !
Perhaps he was reckoning without his host
Who knows ?   But his own reckoning made
him happy, and the host's reckoning had not
yet been presented.
Reckoning thus, lie walked lightly along
over the snow, with his hands in his pockets
and his shoulders thrown back, as was his

wont, and the skate-steels jingling together  gayly-whistled and walked happier than an
with a merry sound which reverberated on    emperor, for in his heart the bliss of first love
the still night air. As he walked, lie whistled was swelling.

" And what is to be the upshot of this love,
Willie ?" inquired his mother.
" The upshot,mother? Marriage,of course."
" Oh ! of course," said MI's. Gentry, moving
away from her son. " Marriage ! Upon my
word, at what age will children marry next ."
" I am past twenty, mother," urged the boy.
You are in no position to marry yet,
Willie," said his father; "your salary is too
small."
"It would be if the lady were a different
sort of person. But O father! she is so
good, and so modest, and content with so lit-
tie, I'm sure you would love her dearly if you
knew her."
"Who is she?'
"Yes, by the Way," echoed Mrs. Gentry,
who is she ?"
" Whv, you've seen her once. Oshite's so
pretty and so good ! Dear other, you can't
help loving her OWhen vou know her.
" Who is she, I ask !"
" Why, she is that beautiful creature we
saw at Young Men's llall. You know the
oe who stood on the pedestal-the Gsoldilss
of Iiicrty."
" An actress!'"
A Ihiallet-d:meer !"

" Don't attempt to justiftv her, Willie ! I
won't listen to it. I tell you you shall m/
marry her. Alh ! I dare Lay nw you w ill tell
me you are your own master, and w ill do as
you like.  c Very well! I suppose a itotlers
broken heart goes for nothing."  Anid 3r-.
Gentry burst into tears.
" Dear, dear mother,'' said Willie, kistsing
her over and over again, "don't take on so-
don't-don't, for iny sake."
Why should I do any thing more for your
sake ? This is what has kept you away front
me-playing the gallaitt at the feet of a co-
quette-an actress."
" Mother," said Will in a low, angry voice,
4 you mustn't cast a slur on her on account
of her profession. It's as good and honora-
ble a calling as any other, if it's only well and
honorably followed."
" And I suppose this young miss is highly
honorable ?"
" Yes, site is ; and if any man dares to say
she is not, I-I'll knock him down for it."
"Come, Willie." said his father, "let's

PAcaj'LLTiIo1 P.

have no more words abont it. Have you
made up your mind to marry this person ?"
" I have, father."-
" Then you must choose between her love
and mine," said Mrs. Gentry, rising to leave
the room.
"Won't you kiss me good-night, mother ?"
asked the boy tenderly.
Keep your kisses," she answered, " for
-where, I dtare saye, they are to be had cheap
enougih-on the blips of that girl.''
Poor little Fifiie ! To think that sie should
hie accused of givin her kisses cheap! She,
off whose fre- young lips Willie's ow t11had
bruslhed the first dew.
After his mother was gone, Willie sat on
the sofa anmd 1 iiehed his face in his hands.
" This is a sad busine s," sdil tie father.
"Father, mother is cruel to ime. She has
tio ight spoken ill of the dearest girl that
ever lived. My blood boiled while she was
doing.so. If it had been any one but iy own
mother 1-0 father, father ! how can m  y

W\illie's turn to break down, and cob.

said Mr. (Gentry gravely ; " and such a good
imiotler she has beeni to you-so loving-so
devote" .
"I know it," said Willie, soling.
It would be a sal thing for nme to see a
breaking up1 in our little household, where we
have all h    'en so happy.' 'lhre were tears
im the eyes of the elder man now.
" I ti 't anticipate for a moment any
breaking up or divisioni" said Willie. raisin
his head. " I thought we could all live here
together happily and comfortably."
".It appears it can not be."
" 0 father what am I to do ?"
'Willie, your first duty is to your mother.
Think of her."
" But 0 father 1" said the boy, grasping
his father's hand, "I love my little girl so
tiearly "
Have you asked her to marry you yet ?"
No ; but I have asked her to give me her
love, and she has given it."
" Well, then, my~ boy, I think you had bet-
ter wait a bit before asking her to marry you.
You see, my child, it is such a serious obliga-

yourself. See whether this is true love, or

Those wretched " two years."   They are
invariably proposed to lovers, who almost in-

the father.  " By that thime, I do not doubt

a worldly point of view, a far better match.

One thing was painfully clear in the letter,'
and it was the only thing that was clear,
IIe seemed to wish her to understand that
she must not love him any longer-must riot
play Juliet to his Romeo on any future oc-
casion, because henceforth they were to be
" friends" only, " dear, lear friends" and
nothing more.
Friends! Fudge ! Could she be nothing
more than a friend to him-the first man
who had ever stirred her heart to love? No ,
he asked the impossible. She would see him
tic iore.
But could she stand so severe a. test as
this? Could she run the chance of meeting
him in the streets, and have courage enough
to turn her head away from himx  and shun
him?
She felt like a child standing on the rocky
shore of an angry sea-a sudden gust of
wind might sweep her over to be lost. She
wasp not iimuch more than a child; but in
somie cireum-stances ani instant of time suif-
fiees to fully mature such childhood as hers.
She grew very eahen now; the tears were
dry on her cheeks, and her whole bearing
was dignilied and composed. With a steady
step, she went down-stairs and opened the
door of her guardian's room.
Mr. Ihagglethuorpe was glancing through a
volume of Shakespeare-his favorite after-
breakfast recreation. It " toned hii up," he
said. The girl walked up to the old man,
andi tlaid hx'er hand in his.
My dear," he said, looking at her pale
face wxeithi surprise. " What is the matter ?"
Only this, Guardy," she answered, "I
want to go away."
lie gazed at her over his spectacles with
blank astonishment, and she repeated the
words.
I want to go away.'
"Away ? Away from where?     Surely not
a-away from mei 1"
She threw her arms about his neck and
. kissed him fondly.
"Oh ! no," she exclaimed  not from you
--ih ! no. I want to go away from   this
place ; miles away from it ! I want to be
somewhere where  I shall never lay eyes on
r  hin agaix.
" On who, child 2"
" On Willie Gentry," she answered, crying

"What has happened ?" asked the good
Mr. Bagglethorpe, with blazing eyes.
Guardy, I should have told you long ago,
but I scarcely knew it myself until now ; and
that is, I-that I love him so dearly-so
fondly, and lie-he-"
He ?' asked the old man fiercely, and
pressing her slight little figure closely in his
arms. ''lIe what ?"
Ile loves me too, dearly," she answered.
But he don't want to marry tire--"
"nWI? 2"
'o.  lie wants me to be his dear friend
only-''
Damn   him ! I'll kill him !" shouted
the good Mr. Bagglethorpe, dealing a blow on
the table which might almost have broken all
our of its legs at once.
Oh! no, no, Guardy--no, Guardy---don't
Don't say such terrible words !Im mex-
plaminiig it all wrong.  You shall read his
letter, and I will tell you all that has ever
happened between us. There is no harm
done, Guardy--not the least in the world !"
She laid her hand on her heart and sighed,
and after they had read the letter, began her
story---her simple little story of love-adora-
tion-idolatry--lavislied-upon an object, recip-
rocated by an object.  It was the A B C
of love. Like all primers, it had been easy
enough at first, and pleasant study; but then
that "hard word " in three syllables, Miu iii
Aos: had con ; and very hard it was.
The two old people listened to her ;ond
listening, their hearts warmed. Not alone to
her and to the boy on whom she poured such
lavish and wild encomium, but to each other.
They too had loved thus ; yes, and thus, spite
of age, ad-ersi tv, sorrow, suffering, and pain,
thus, thank God, the two old hearts loved each
other still.
" And so I thought I had better come to
you and tell you. I come to you in this as I
have come to you for years, moy more than
father and mother. I had such. a dreadful
moment of temptation. I felt that I must
rush away to him and fly from yoi-you who
have been all im all to me. And, dear Guardy,
I am  young yet, and experienced in the
ways of the world ; but I know that I lov,-
him and that lhe loves me."
There was a moment of silence, and first

uviUti'1  (RIOS, .                     25
one then the other kissed the girl tenderly.
She sobbed as though her heart would break.
" I hate myself. I do," she said. "1 am
wronging you in loving him so much. And
I am going to try to contlter it."
You cani not, dear," said Mr. Bagglethorpe
gravely.  "You can not conquer it. Love is
yoosially lictered as a little boy without an
clothess on, much less steel armor-hut he's a
tough one to deal with--tougher'n any other
of the creeters of mytholergy, to my notion.
Ef I hied hed the making oni him, 1 should hev
peitered him a six-looter withi a vizier draw red
down over his face, and a double-edge scored

" What shall I do, Guardyl x-"
"You can't do  anv thin', you pore leetle

Mr. lagglethorpe to rise dkal to.  I shall

 Don't you go doiin' any thin' rash, Bag-
gley," said Mrs. Bagglithorpe.
tImmiceelyer,'' Was the dignified reply,
fear not. I shall hollur il on th' troubled
waters." And he gathered Filtine to his heart
in a tender embrace.

TttoT evening, as the Gentry family sat at
tea, the brawny Ellen was summoned to the
door by the active ringing of the bell there-
of.  And coming back antntouncedt that,
"Sure, 'tn, the ;good Mistlier Baggiltharp,'tt,
an' ie's in the pairlor a-nwaitin'."
" Nay, that is an error, my innercent and
guileless Bridget," remarked Mr. Baggle-
thorpe, entering the dining-room, with his hat
in his hand, and bowing low.
Will gentry spran to his feet, napkin in
htatnd, tossed between the conflictiig emotions
of astonislunent at this apparition and a wild
desire to offer it a chair.
Mr. Bagglethorpe took his hat affectionately
to his breast, and lunched at once into his
speech.
"i tr. and Mrs. Genterv-sir and madam----
set doxwn, 'William, 1 do not wiht to set
down myself--my dooty is with your parents,
umy son.  I am here, my friends-if you will
permit the term-as a unworthy ambassador
from the court of love. But excuse mtc.  I
ramble.  The pint is this. You Itv ben in-
formed that your est little son has contracted
a attachment so to speak, for the young lady
who is known to the public by the title of Lar
Peetette }'efeene.  Es I tinderstadtl, this
yere attachment is not es agreeable to you es
it is to the young people.  Quite lateral, Mr.
and Mrs. Gentery.   This young man, feeling'
that his fast ilooty is to his parrensts, has
nobly, manly, self-sacrificin'ly, writ a letter to
my ward, station' the circumstances, and asking'
for time---askin' fir two years of time.  I tin
quite es willing , sir and nadlai, to grant that
time, es your honerbhle selves. The young
iatn's sal is tit seeh as to warrant him in
takin' a wife, while his parents liev a -laim
which he, in his filyul beauty and loveliness,
reco'nizes. What it lies cost his brave young
heart to take this step, you may not know,
but you can no doubt realize if you make a
proper effort so to do. Onet you was yount
Mr., and Mrs. Gentery.-oiet you also was a

suitor at the court of love, Mr. Gentery--as
I was, as Mrs. B. was, as we all was.   The
feelix' which anerimates the bosom  of your
noble and well-edicated son, is the same feel-
in' that we too hey felt.  It is a feeling' in the
presence of which no honerble man kan say,
I ant better ner thou. But I will not ratnble.
The pint is this. Feefeene is as dear to mIle, Mr-
and Mrs. Genterv, is the apple of iy eve. I
tookt- her forum her dxiin' other's ars-I
promnist to be a father to her.  The leetle
creature' hes crcp itto iy heart of hearts, and
it will cost ie a pang to part xx it lher.  But
I shell do my dooty.
The good Mr. Bagglethorpe's eyes were
filled with tears, and lie no longer looked at
his tudieice, but kipt his gaze steadily fixed
upon the Ceihin' overhead, till he had con-
eltudedl his speech.

year, the sum of five hundred dollars, es a

Feefeene.   Thar it lies laid  ever sence,
draxwrin' interest.  I hed long determined to
give Feefcene a edication, feclin' the lack of

that it made my old heart ache to think of
parting' from her.  She was yooseful to tile in

sooperiors and fewer ekals.  I clung to her,
ant postponed the edictatin' onher.  The time

she adorns, and put her into a hoardin'-
