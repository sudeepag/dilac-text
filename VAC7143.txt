CHAPTER I. LORD WINTON was expected Home that night-as indeed he, had been for the last three or four nights. It was now late-so very late that, the servants all retired for the night; but  his wife was still up watching and waiting for him. How anxious she looks, as she sits there by the window, in listening posture, gazing out into the moonlight, eager to catch the first foot-fall or glimpse of him as he comes over the lawn. She has neither eaten nor slept during the last forty-eight hours. How pale and worn she looks! What mental agony, is depicted on every feature! But mark! how her eye lightens with joy and love as the ring of horse's hoofs, from away down the stony road, falls on her list- ening ear. With a bound she leaves the window, )   10   THE DUKIES WONDERFUL ESCAPE, and in a moment more is out and on her way to meet him. While hastening over the lawn she looks attentively at a darling little metal picture, of a beautiful domestic scene, in the foreground of which she sees a wife folded in the arms of her husband, her tearful face upturned to his, admin- istering sundry tender upbraidings for having staid away so long. And he in turn silencing all her loving complaints with a shower of kisses. She reached the gate; it was ajar-at which she was a little surprised. She passed out, and now for the first time noticed that the sounds which had brought her forth were rapidly dying away in the distance. Her picture vanished, and with it all her lightness of heart. And, with a sigh of sadness, she turned to retrace her steps, when some one called her in a whisper by an endearing name which her husband had given her, and by which he only had ever called her. It must be he! and with a start of gladness she rushed to the spot, with no other expectation than that of rushing into his arms; when lo! instead of his embrace, she found herself in the 'lutches of what looked like a hideous woman. She recoiled! The hag tightened her grasp! Sjwrwrithed spasmodically! The hag held her as in a vice! She struggled to free herself I The hag was very strong!-too strong,   THE D UAE'S WONDERFtL ESCAPE.   " she thought, to be a woman. She tried to scream! The hag grinn:ed! As soon as she could speak, she entreated that she might be set at liberty! The hag replied, in a whisper, by asking: "Who and what are you, out here alone at this time of night?" "I'm Lady Winton, and have come forth to meet my husband, whom I momently expect." "You need not expect Lord Winton to-night; he will not be here. He is at Lord Glenchester's " (Lady Winton shuddered). "And, moreover, he is not your husband; the ceremony which united him to you was not legal, and he who performed it had no legal right to do so. Lord Winton has no wife, but it is expected that he soon will have. He will marry Lady Glenchester, to whom he was affianced in infancy. And I'm here to-night to inform his housekeeper that he, with Lady Glen- chester and her attendants, will breakfast here to-morrow morning at nine o'clock; that his lord- ship is particularly anxious that you and your children be kept out of the way, as he does not wish Lady Glenchester to know of your exist- ence." What more the hag said is not known, as Lady Winton had by this time fainted quite away. When she awoke to consciousness, it was broad   12   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCIAPE. daylight, and she was reclining on a couch in her own sleeping apartment. She tried repeatedly to convince herself that the events of the night were all a horrible dream. Failing to do so, she rose mechanically, and, with a look of mental anguish, began pacing the room, pressing her forehead from time to time with her hands, and gazing abstractedly out of the window. Soon she heard a noise be- low, a great stir, as of several arrivals. And sure enough [ there they were; the very ones of whom the hag had told her. Her anxious eye immediately sought out her husb'and, who, instead of flying to her side, as was his wont after an absence, was gallantly assisting Lady Glenchester to alight from her carriage, after which he walked leisurely along by' her side. With a quick, wild air, Lady Winton stepped to a place where she could see them as they came in. The door opened and they enteed, she smil- ing sweetly up in his face, and 'z iving her a look which sent her eyes dancing to the floor. But why do they not proceed?, Why does Lord Winton stand there like a statue, his feet riveted. to the spot, his cheek blanched to the pallor of -death, his pale lips rigidly compressed, his eyes, that a moment before sparkled with assumed love and gallantry, cold and motionless, and fixed with   T HE D UKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   ' 13 a terrible stare on some object'at the other end of the hall? It is his wife; but oh how changed! He gazed for a moment, and then, forgetful of ev- erything else,. with the swiftness of an arrow, flew to the spot where she stood. But she was not there. Seeing no love-light in his eyes she had turned and fled, he supposed, to her dressing-room, and he repaired thither himself. He tried the door, it was locked; he rapped, there was no response. He called her by that endearing name-all was si- lent. He stood for a moment to' consider, when sounds frorn below remitnded him of his guests. He descended to the drawing-room, which he had scarcely entered when a courier, all jaded and cov- ered with dust, was announced, and hastened to in- form his lordship that his father, the Duke of Grove- land, was lying at the point of death, and longed to see him before he dled, and hinted that if he wished to be in season for his father's dying bless' ing, it would be necessary to set out immediately, and travel night and day with all speed. Again Lord Winton sought his wife, and not finding her, dispatched servants in every direction, exploring the house and grounds, but all to no pur- pose; and, with a heavy heart, he sought his car- riage, threw himself into it; and bade the coach- man drive off.   "  THE D UKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. About ten o'clock that day, as Mrs. Mills-who lived fully three miles from Winton Hall--sat sew- ing in her neat cottage, surrounded by her birds and plants, she thought she heard something rub- bing against the door; she'wondered at it, but sat still. As it continued from time to time, she finally rose and opened the door, and was startled at beholding a woman, with flushed face and di- sheveled hair, sitting on the sill. A second look, however, elicited a cry of recognition. She threw her arms about her neck, and exclaimed, "Annie! my dear Annie! what does this mean? How did you come here?" Lady Winton-for it was she-replied with a vacant stare. Mrs. Mills sat down by her side, took her in her arms, chafed her hands and temples, and finally induced her to go in and lie down. The feverish- ness of her skin and breath, and the rapidity of her pulse, all indicated to Mrs. Mills that she was very ill, and ought to have a doctor, but as there was no one to send, she administered a simple medicine, which she always kept by her, tht was both cooling in its tendency and quieting to the nerves, and sat down to await the .result. To all her questions, Lady Winton's only reply was a piteous moan, accompanied by the words,   THE D VUK'S WON2DERFUL ESCAPE.  15 "The love-light is all gone from his eyes! all gone! all gone! he do n't love me any more!" "Poor child! she's heard the reports; I feared she would," sighed Mrs. Mills, and the good woman wept for sympathy. J When Mr. Mills cam home from his little village school, he went immediately for the doctor, and 'thence to the hall to inform Lord Winton. He was much surprised to find that his lordship had that morning been summoned to the death-bed of his father, and that the hall was occupied by Lady Glenchester and suit. The doctor found Lady Winton suffering with brain fever, and divining something of the cause, forbade her being removed to the hall; said she would do much bet- ter where she was, as her recovery depended very much upon her enjoying the utmost quiet-upon freedom from all mental distraction. Three weeks passed. Lady Winton was very low! there was little or no hope of her recovery. Nothing had been heard from Lord Winton, though letter after letter had been sent him. Could' it be possible that he knew of her illness! that she was rapidly sink- ing, and yet did not even write? If so, then the "Iove-light" had indeed deserted her. Mr. Mills couldn't believe that such was the case. And wishing-as he said-" to do as he'd be done S   16   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. by," he dismissed his school for a few days, and went himself, to make sure that Lord Winton was not ignorant of the great loss he was about to sus- tain. On his arrival he learned that the old duke was dead, and that his estates and title had descended to his eldest son, Lord George Winton, the hero of our story, who was now confined to his bed from a severe attack of hemorrhage of the lungs. His grace received Mr. Mills with great cordiality, and complained bitterly of Annie's neglect, in not answering a single one of the many letters which he had caused to be sent to her; listened with amazed attention to Mr. Mills' account of her; the kindling of his eye, the quivering of his nos- trils, the rigid compression of his lips, and increased pallor of his whole countenance, alone betraying the depth of his emotion, which was so great, in- deed, that for some time after the narration he was Unable to control his voice sufficiently to speak. "Dear heart!" he at length broke forth, "she shall have one letter, at least, if you'll be scribe, Mr. Mills." And, causing himself to, be propped up in bed, he dictated a short letter, while Mr. Mills wrote. When they parted he said, playfully, '"Give this to Annie, and tell her not to pine away if I don't happen to write again; but to get strong and well by the time I return, as I shall ,  *   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     17 want to have her proclaimed Duchess of Grove. land." Mr. Mills had the happiness of finding her grace convalescent, though not yet out of danger. She was too low to see any one, much less to receive so precious a letter. As she improved physically, her mind seemed permanently impaired. She would sit or lie listlessly for hours together, her hands folded, looking into vacancy.. At length,' with many forebodings, they gave her the letter; nor had they cause to regret doing so, for she at once roused from her lethargy. Her eye once more sparkled with intelligence, as she kissed the let- ter again and again, pressed it to her heart, and would n't allow it to be taken out of her sight. S e iow, for the first time, asked for her children, d tye manner-of her reception of them showed that she still had all a mother's heart. To the suId  of her returning to the hall she never al- luded, until she accidentally heard of Lady Glen- chester's departure, when she expressed a wish to go thither, in order to be there to welcome her husband on his arrival. Accordingly the day was set, and Mrs. Mills was to accompany her. "Good morning, Mrs. Mills," said a short, sleek- looking, little black-eyed man, who stood, hat in hand, at that lady's gate.   18   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Why, good morning, Mr. Star! Where under the sun did you come from so early this beautiful morning?, I beg your pardon for not seeing you before; but I was so busy with imy plants!" "Oh, no apologies necessary, Mrs. Mills; I've been standing here-" "Won't you walk in, Mr. Star, and see my gar- den? Mr. Mills'll be back pretty soon; he's just gone down to the post-office; I'm expecting him every minute." "No, I thank you, Mrs. Milis; I have n't time to stop," looking at his watch. "As I was saying, I've been standing here wondering how I should ever break the news to you." "News! what news? Has the duke come?" "No, not he! You'll never see him here again, in my humble opinion." "Why, what do you mean? Has he sent for the duchess instead of coming himself?" "Not he!  I think he'll marry Lady Glenches- ter of Glenchester, to whom he has long been en- gaged, and never trouble this lady any more." "Lady Glenchester! why he's already married to another--to our Annie here. Poor child, I hope she didn't hear what you said; it'd make her crazy!"   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    19 "I beg your pardon! but I thnk you are mis- taken." "You are the mistaken one, Mr. Star. I know it, for I saw the ceremony performed myself, and by a man of as good legal authority as any in the land. And I'm sure his grace means to abide by, it; at any rate, I think he 'll have to." "Was his marriage ever published?" "No, nor did he intend it should be in his fath- er's lifetime; because the old duke's heart was so set on his marrying Lady Glenchester. But the marriage was witnessed by at least fifty persons of the highest respectability and some of his own rank." "It's strange his father never heard of it, if it was so public as that." "Be that as it may, he is the lawful husband of Annie Campbell, now the Duchess of Groveland," said Mrs. Mills, her eye kindling with indignation. "But," added she, "what is the news? you have n't told me any yet." "Sure enough!" replied he, his face lighting up with a,smile, significant of something it gave him great pleasure to communicate. "It is very nearly allied to- the case in hand, only with this difference, that your reputed Duchess of Groveland is about   20   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.. to elope with a young English captain, instead of the dulke's forsaking her." "It's false! every word of it," said she, with emphasis. "What, is false?" asked Mr. Mills, coming up just in time to hear the last sentence, touching his hat and bowing to Mr. Star. "That Annie is about to elope with a young English captain." Mr. Mills threw himself back and laughed heart- ily. 'Why, man alive!" said he, at length, you could n't hire her, for any sum, to leave the duke. You ought to have seen the way-she acted over his letter that I brou ht her! No, sir; she'll never leave the duke; she thinks her life of him." "She thinks a great deal too much of him," sighed Mrs. Mills, wiping her spectacles. "If she thought half as much of her Maker, it would be better for her." "I do n't know about that, wife. I hardly think a woman can love her husband too well. But how did this story about the captain originate? Mr. Star, has any one of that description been hanging around?" "Not of that description. exactly, as I know of;, but a person has been about. Only the night be- fore the duke came home the last time-when he   -  l THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     21 brought Lady Glenchester with him-she was seen, at a very late hour, sitting by her window, evi- dently,watching for some one;,and before morn- ing she was seen in the street, in the arms of a very suspicious-looking individual, dressed like a woman, but no one thoght it was one. The gardener told me only yesterday that this apparent woman was no doubt the English captain in dis- guise. And it is the opinion of every one that the real reason she left the hall and came here was that she might meet him oftener than she could there." "The gardener had better keep quiet, or he'll get his walking papers when the duke gets home," said Mrs. Mills. "Yes; his grace'll have some of you fellows up for slander if you do n't be careful," added Mr. Mills. "When will she return to the hall?" "To-day if it keeps pleasant. She wants to be there to welcome his grace when he comes." "She has received one letter then? I was not aware that she had received any," said Mr. Star, half to himself, and' with evident concern. "Yes," said Mr. Mills, "and but one." Mr. Star looked relieved. "That is another matter that the duke will'have to look into when he returns. It is a singular fact that none of our letters reached him   22   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. and none of his reached us, though both parties of us wrote repeatedly." "It is a little strange!" said Mr. Star, his eye seeking the floor. "Yes, it is strange enough! and I shall urge his grace to have the matter sifted to the bottom." "Did you get any letter?" asked Mrs. Mills, after Mr. Star took leave and they walked into the house. "No; but I got a paper, which is almost-as good." "What paper is it?" "The London Chronicle; and I'm glad enough to get it, for I have n't seen a copy of it for these two years." "But, dear me! how much smaller it is than it used to be, and what miserable paler," observed Mrs. Mills. "' That's a fact! but you know times change; per- haps the proprietors can't afford any better. But what! What's this?" "Is it bad news?" Without stopping to answer her he read aloud the notice of the marriage of George, present duke of Groveland, to Lady Glenchester of Glenchester. "What! Are n't you mistaken?" "Dear knows I should be glad if I was mistaken; but there it is, in so many words, just as I read it." They sat in mute astonishment, not knowing what   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     23 to say, when the door opened, and in sprang Annie, her face, though pale and thin, all radiant with joy and expectation, and exclaimed, "I'm all ready mother!" but she stopped when she saw their troub- led faces, and asked, "What is the matter,?" at the same time seating herself on a stool at Mrs. Mills' feet. "Matter enough, my poor child," replied Mrs. Mills, "I'm afraid you'll hardly see the Duke of Groveland to-day!" replied Mr. Mills solemnly. "Why! what does it all mean? Has anything happened to him? Please tell me and not keep me in suspense!"  "It means this," said Mr. Mills, placing his finger on the marriage notice. Her face gradually assumed the appearance of a corpse, and they thought she was going to faint; but suddenly she exclaimed, "It is some horrid mis- take! I know it is." "God grant that it may be!" said Mr. Mills. "What paper is this?" "London Chronicle. It has always been consid- ered a very reliable source of news." "I don't believe what it says in this case! I don't believe George would be so dishonorable; he couldn't either, for is he not already married to    24   THE DUIIKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. me? I did believe it once, but I never will again unless I have it from his own lips." "If it is so you'll never have it from his own lips; for I do n't believe he'd ever have the face to see you. He 'll probably write. Have you had any letter from him lately?" "I've had no letter since he left except the one you gave me; and in that he said our marriage should now be made public, and that he'd be home as soon as he could; and I feel somehow as though he'd be here to-day or to-morrow." "Come to think, it may be that he intended to have your marriage published, and they've put it Lady Glenchester, because 'twas generally under- stood that she was to be his wife," said Mrs. Mills. "Yes, I guess that must be it, after all," added Mr. Mills. "I knew it must be a mistake," chimed the duch- ess, casting suspicious glances at the paper. In a few minutes both ladies were seated in the carriage and on their way to the hall. "You poor, little, fatherless children!" said her grace, kissing her two little girls with forced gay- ety, and taking the youngest from the nurse's lap on her own. She then said, "Wo'nt the duke have a laugh at our fright when he comes p? "I don't know whether he 'll laugh or cry. I   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    25 should think he'd be very indignant at the mistake; and I hope in all mercy he '1 have it corrected and not let folks think he's married Lady Glenchester." On arriving at the hall Annie found a guest await- ing her, who introduced himself as Dr. Stranton, physician to the late Duke of Groveland; and he handed her a letter which he said the present duke lad intrusted to his care. She looked at the seal, held it to her lips, examined the superscription, and after fully satisfying herself that it was the hand- writing of the duke's own secretary, opened it, and without a motion or change of countenance, except that her face gradually became blanched, read it through, then threw it at Mrs. Mills, gasping, "O, mother, it is too true!" and immediately fell to the floor. Dr. Stranton and Mrs. Mills, with the aid of a servant, carried her to her own room in a perfectly senseless state. Under the doctor's restoratives, however, she soon revived; and he recommended that she be kept perfectly quiet, and administered an opiate. Mrs. Mills' state of mind can better be imagined than described. She remained by Annie until she seemed to sleep; then carefully closing the door, walked out into the garden, not daring to trust her- self with any of the household, for fear of being /   26   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. questione'in regard to Annie's sudden illness. On cautiously stealing, an hour afterward, into the room, she found that the object of her anxiety was not asleep, nor had been. With a flushed face and wild, unnatural stare, she broke forth, "O, mother! mothter! all my hopes are forever blasted!" Some time afterward she expressed a wish to see Dr. Stranton alone. Mrs. Mills remained in the room during the conversation, but so far from them as to be unable to hear anything that was said. Though the interview was long, and Annie seemed much agitated, she did not shed a tear. Toward night, when Mrs. Mills came to return home, she threw her arms about her neck, and for the first time wept. "O! Mrs. Mills," she sobbed, 'you are now my only friend! You have always been kind- to me. You have been a mother to me! Won't you pray for me?"After some more weep- ing she pressed her hot cheek against that of Mrs. Mills, and in broken accents said, "Farewell, my more than mothler! we meet in this world no more Z" Mrs. Mills looked at her, and concluding the last sentence resulted from the morphine she had taken tofause sleep, smiled, and said she would not say farewell, for she expected to see her in the morning, and hoped, too, that they should yet spend many happy hours together.   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    27 Annie followed her to the door, and gazed after her till she was out of sight. The next morning, as Mrs. Mills was making preparations to set out on another visit to the hall, a messenger came in great haste, asking if she knew anything about Annie, and stating that she, her two children, and Dr. Stranton had all disappeared dur- ing the night. The two old people, of course, knew nothing about them, and were in great consternation. Mrs. Mills told her husband that Annie had re- ceived a letter confirming the news in the London Chronicle, but could say nothing further, not having read the letter. "Well, but why did n't you read it, or find out what was in it?" "I have the letter," said she, producing it from her pocket, " but will never read writing addressed to another without permission." "Why woman alive! what other permission do you want than having the letter thrown at you? Give it to me! I'll take all the responsibility! My Scruples are not very strong on such points." And. with that he opened the letter, and read as follows: "DEAR ANNIE: Allow me to call you such once more, as this is the last time I shall ever address you. Forgive me for what I am about to write, and try to forget me. I am a perjured villain! I am this mo-   28   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL 'ESCAPE. ment the husband of another! Since I saw you I have been induced to marry Lady Glenchester. On arriving here, I found that my father would leave his entire property to my brother unless I married as he wished me to. For your sake I yielded, knowing if I did so I could still support you in affluence, which I could not do otherwise. She has my hand, but you, dearest Annie, will ever have my heart. I beg of you to leave the country immediately. Dr. Stranton, the bearer of this epis- tle, will be a safe counselor, and has promised to convey you away, if you wish him to do so. I advise you by all means to trust to him, and through him I will, from time to time, supply you with funds. You will leave the children behind, as they are lawfully mine, and I wish to educate them according to their rank. It is my especial wish and command that you never try to see or address me by writing. With my best wishes and unceasing love, I bid you a final farewell. "G. WINTON, Duke of Groveland." "The cowardly villain!" exclaimed Mr. Mills, throwing down the letter, and pacing the room, tak- ing remarkably long strides and stepping yery en- ergetically withal. "If I loved a woman as he professes to love her, I'd work my fingers off but what I'd support her without giving her up so!"   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   29 "Who's that?' asked Mrs. Mills, as she caught a glimpse of some one, and saw her husband stop to look out. "It's that sneaking Star! Hang him, he looks as though he was tickled to death! and I believe in my soul he has something to do with it! You ought to have seen the triumphant bow he made as he passed the window!" "You know he wanted her before the duke knew her, though she never encouraged his atten- tions, and he's seemed to owe her a grudge ever since. But I think it is very bad taste for him to take so much pains to show his joy." "Bad taste! . Why it's absolute impertinence! and it won't do for him to repeat it very often! He 11 find she has friends yet! Poor thing! it's no wonder she's gone; I would n't have done it though! He's the one to leave the country! and he shall do it or fare worse. By George! this whole thing shall be brought to light, as sure as my name is Mills," said he, bringing his hand down on the table with great force. "Yes, Mrs. Mills, that vil- lainous George Winton shall be brought to account for his conduct in this matter." '"Be cautious, do, Mr. Mills! You know it is the great Duke of Groveland of whom you speak!" "Duke of Satan! Do you suppose I 'd care if he   80   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. 'was the foul fiend himself? I tell you as sure as my name is Mills, this case shall be laid before the queen." "What case is it you are so intent upon bring- ing before her majesty? Perhaps I can render you some assistance," said a very pleasant voice, which proved to be that of the duke himself, who had just ridden up to the gate, extending his hand to Mr. Mills, who, thunderstruck, was soon at his side. "What is it, my friend?" continued the duke, shaking the hand of Mr. and then Mrs. Mills with the utmost cordiality, smiling and wondering at their confusion. "A" sad case enough," said Mr. Mills, "as your grace already knows." "I do not understand you, Mr. Mills," said his grace. "You speak in riddles." "Is your grace the author of this letter?" "co, nor did I ever see it before! May I ask how you came byit, my good lady?" Mrs. Mills, with the assistance of her husband, related the circumstances already known to the reader, Mr. Mills also showing the notice in the London Chronicle. "This is the work of enemies!" exclaimed his grace. "Does the duchess know and believe it?" "She knows it, and so fully does she believe it   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    31 that she and her children left the hall last night in company with Dr. Stranton." The duke heaved a deep groan, and, wringing their hands, said: "Farewell, my friends, I must look for Annie- the only woman I ever married or ever shall." So saying, he put spurs to his horse and rode off, they watching and admiring him, as he almost flew through the air, till he disappeared among the trees.   32 X  THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. CHAPTER II. ,GlH! what a cold, raw November day it O^  was! Iow sullen the sky looked! And how. the wind blew! how it whisked the leaves about! What times it had, dancing, piping, and singing around the fence corners, among the little bushes, and in the tops of the great trees! And, most of all-most ungracious of all-how it sighed and screamed in the ears of those two starved, pinched-up little girls, walking hand in hand over the oak-openings, in Western New York! But they didn't care two straws for the whole of it! Let it spit snow if it wanted to! And what if they were meanly and thinly clad, wearing linsey-wool- sey dresses, red and yellow cotton handkerchiefs pinned round them for shawls, outlandish-looking straw bonnets trimmed with faded pink ribbon, and rough, ragged shoes and stockings-evidently never made for them-they were all in all to each other, and were now alone together, which was a great and rare luxury. 4 Do n't less. hurry, Greeta, if it is cold," said   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    33 Estella, the elder of the two, possibly ten years old, "for you know it's the last time we shall have a chance to have a good long talk together for a great while." "Is it?" said Greeta, inquiringly. "Why yes I did n't you hear the superintendent of the Sabbath-school say that we would n't meet again till settled weather in the spring? And you know step-mother never lets us go anywhere else together. I heard her tell father she would never consent for us to go to Sabbath-school if it wasn't for the speech of people, and she never lets us talk together at home. If she sees us looking at each other as if we wanted to talk she's sure to scold or whip us. Come, if you 're so cold as to shiver and chat- ter your teeth like that, let's cuddle down behind this big old tree, out of the way of the wind, and have one more good, long talk." "I wish we had n't any step-mother; I wish our own dear mother was back again," said little Greeta. "I wish so too; and I do n't believe our mother is dead! It won't always be so, any way, for when we grow up-we 're getting to be pretty large girls now-we shall get married, and thei, you know, our husbands 'll take care of us." "Will I be married, too?"   34   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Of course you will! I'll be married to some- body that has a brother just his own age, and looks just like him, and he shall have you. Our hus- bands'll have farms about two miles apart, and such nice houses on them! They must be just alike! and furnished splendidly! The things all alike! and just like the things Mr. Woods' folks have in their house! such handsome carpets and everything! We'll be married the same day, and dressed just alike! white dresses and slippers, rosies-in our hair, and our bead-bags on our arms! We'll be married at my husband's house, because he's to be the oldest, you know!" "I thought you said he was to be just the age of my husband!" "Well, yes, he is, really; but after he is married to me he'll be the oldest, because I'm the oldest; for you know husband and wife are always one. After supper your husband'll take you home to his house. You're not to see it till after the wedding, and you'll be so delighted to find it's just like mine! such a nice' orchard, and fowers, and everything! carriage-house-you know Mr. Woods' folks have one-and such splendid horses and carriages! and all just like my husband's and mine-for you know everybody says husband and wife are one after they are married.

We'll have them just of an age, and always dressed just the same. They must visit each other every day or two, and oh! what nice times they will have, and we '1l be so proud of them!" Here Estella's happiness found vent in singing, and, springing away to some distance, she began to gather winter-greens, leaving her sister still nestled down by the old tree, and buried in a profound rev- ery, which was interrupted by a horseman riding stealthily up, eyeing her closely as he came. He rode a black horse, and was muffled in a gray cloak. His eyes were large and full, and of that peculiar shade of black which accompanies dark auburn hair, though his was'now grizzled, and his long beard was almost white. He was portly in person, and had a florid countenance, and would have been thought a fine-looking man, had not the lines in his face indicated a cruel and despotic disposition. With an assumed winning tone and look, he asked Greeta if she knew anything of a man by the name of Hienry Forsith? "6h, yes!" said the little girl, rising to her feet; "that used to be my father's name when we lived at Lake Island; but it is n't that any more."   86   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Why, bless me, little girl! what is the matter with your hand?" "Nothing," said Greeta, looking surprised, and at the same time opening and holding up both hands, which previously had been lying folded in her lap; but presently, when she saw him looking curiously at her right hand, the palm of which was of a deep crimson, she blushed, and, hiding it un- der her shawl, said, "Oh! that's always there." "So your father do n't live at Lake Island any more?" "No, sir." "Where does he live?" "Off there," said she, pointing off to a great dis- tance, where smoke was to be seen curling up from among the trees. "Ah! what kind of a house is it?" "Log," said Estella, who had by this time come up. "Indeed! that's unfortunate; I've just passed there," and he looked in that direction, as if meas- uring the distance with his eye. "Is your father at home?" "No, sir; he went away to Mr. McCurdy's this morning." "Then there will be no use of retracing my steps," he said, as if talking to himself. "You   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    37 seem to belong to the family," he said, addressing Stella; " sisters, I presume?" "Yes." "Well, this little one tells me that she always had that spot on her hand. Is that so?'" "Yes." "That's peculiar!" said he, with a certain satis- fied look and tone, which seemed to say that one doubtful point was settled; and he cleared out his throat and tried to look pleasant, but the frowns were too deeply fixed. "What is her nauae?" "Greeta." "And yours?" "Estella." "Greeta and Estella what?" "Forsith." "Why, but I thought this little one just now told me that Forsith was not your father's name now!", "It is n't." "Then how does your name come to be that?" "He never told us to call our name Mack!" "Ah! Mack is the name, is it? It's much pret- tier than Foirsith. I presume that that's the reason he changed it." "I do n't know why he changed it."   38  TIIE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "And so he never told you to call your name Mack?" "No, sir," "Well, my little girls, I should do so, whether he told me to or not; for if you have a different name from your father, they'll think you're not his chil- dren." "I do n't care whether they think we're his chil- dren or not! - We do n't like him so very well!" "What! not like your own father? Why is' that?" "He do n't like us!" "Do n't like you? Well, well! that's shabby in him. He ought to like his own children. Your mother likes you enough to make up for his want of love, I dare say?" "Our mother's gone V" "'Your mother gone? What's become of her? Is she dead?" "I do n't know whether she's dead or not; they say she is." "And what makes you doubt it?" "I do n't believe my mother would drown her- self." "She might have fallen into the lake. I believe your sister here said you used to live near one." "She never went to the lake at night."   THE DUKEiS WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   39 "Well, but they found her body did they not?" "They said they did, but I did n't see it!" "Why not?" "They did n't let me." "They very likely wanted you to remember her as she was in life and health!" "The coffin was too long for my mother!" "Perhaps it was the only one they could get?" "It was made to order!" " "You're hard to convince my girl; but who keeps house, if you have no mother?" "Step-mother," "Ah, ha! She's kind I suppose?" ":o, she's not!" "She 's not half so kind as he is," chimed little Greeta. "They're kind to each other of course?" "They are-except when they're drunk!" "Drunk! You do n't mealn to say they get drunk? At least she do n't drink?" "Yes, she does, as much as he does!" "What do they do when they're drunk?" "He whips her, and she swears and talks bad talk." "Where did you say they had gone?" "He's gone to Mr. McCurdy's, ilut she's at home."   40  PTHE DUKES. WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "McCurdy! McCurdy! let's see, what's his first name?" "Jim." "How does he look?" "He's tall, with gray hair and a red face." "And talks so loud that you can hear him before he gets in sight!" added Greeta. "Pretty well described upon my word, little  girls!"And then he reflected. "They seem to remember pretty well, and discriminate remarka- bly! That elder one is wise beyond her years! Both know altogether too much for our purpose! They are decidedly dangerous! Their career must be cut short, of the whole thing will yet leak out!" And with that he took from his side pocket a brace of pistols ; the little girls had never seen anything of the kind, and so were not afraid. He looked about him; away at some distance he saw two men watching a dog that was barking furiously at some- *thing up a tree. He put up his pistols, and taking out a writing case? hastily wrote a short letter, sealed, and directed it to Henry Mack, and giving it to Estella, told her to be sure and give it to no one but her father and not to let any one see her give it to him. "I don't like him a bit!" said Greeta, as he rode off.   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.. -  41 "Nor I, but I'm going to take good care of this letter! She shall never know I've got it! and you must n't tell her!" "No, indeed! I guess I won't!" "And you mustn't tell her that we've seen any man at all!" ' No, I won't!" "For you know if you do, she'll make us tell her all about it!" "Do you know who he is, Stella?" "No; but I 'm almost sure I've seen him before, though I do n't know where."' Here the two little girls began to busy themselves picking winter-green. "Let 's pick her a whole lot! so 't she won't scold us for being gone so long." "Oh less," said little Greeta, and they picked away for dear life. At last, after a long silence Stella said: "G reeta, I know something!" -"Do you? Tell me." "Won't you tell anybody?" "Never, as long as I live!" "Do you hope to die if you do?" Yes, I hope to die the minute I do!" "Now look me straight in the eye, and say, 'I hope to drop dead the minute I tell it.'   42   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.  Greeta repeated, and said, "Now tell me quick, I can't wait." Stella put her lips close to her sister's ear, and said in a loud whisper, "Our mother is n't dead." "How do-you know she is n't? Did she get out of the ground?" She never was in it!" "Was n't she in that black box that they screwed up and put into the grave?" "No ; at least I think she, was n't!" "What makes you think so?" "Won't you never tell?" "No." "As true as you live and breathe?" I hope to drop dead the minute I do!" "Well, do you remember the last time father went to Brierwood?" "Yes." "You remember he brought a letter with him?" "No; I was out in the garden when he came." "Well, if you was out of course I was in, for she never let us be out together if she could help it. He did bring a letter. I wAs knitting behind the door by the window there you know, and the door stood clear open, so that he didn't see me as he came in. He walked straight across the room to her   THE DUItES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    43 and chucked her under the chin, and said, 'Cheer up! all's well!' and drew a chair up close to her, and began to read the letter, but so low that I could n't make out much of it until it said, 'She pleads so hard for her children! 'Of course that means the girls!' he said, looking up to her. 'She knows, as a matter of course, that I'll take care of John, for he 's my own child. The doctor says she's willing to do anything for the sake of her children's lives.' Then I started so that I dropped my knitting needle, and made such a noise that she looked that way, and when she saw me she hunched father, and said,' Little pitchers have great ears!' When he saw me, he said, 'Stella, my daughter, run down to the spring and get father a nice, cool drink of water!' When I came back, the letter was put away. That night after they thought we were all fast asleep, they began to talk about it again. She asked how much money the doctor sent, and he said, ' Three hundred.'" "Three hundred what?" asked Greeta. "Dollars, I suppose. Don't interrupt me; it's getting late, and we shall have to go home pretty soon. She said she thought that was very little; he said he thought so too. 'But,' said he, ' the fact is the doctor wants I should--' Then they spoke so low, almost in a whisper, that I could n't make out   "  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. anything they said; but I'm almost sure it was about killing us! for she asked him loud if he thought he ever would, and he said no, for as soon as that happened the money would stop altogether, and he should have to come to hard labor. She said, 'What if the money should stop any way?' He thought a moment, and then said,' I should n't kill them, but write on and betray the whole thing! I'd turn state's evidence, and get free myself!' They talked a good deal more, and I 'm sure it was all about us, for once he said pretty loud, 'Oh, you can make them live on broths, sour milk, and bran- bread, and such things, that do n't cost much! and as for clothes, you can make them -do with just as few as possibie, and make what they do have out of your old ones!' She said something, and he replied, ' Hang it all, let them do it themselves! I sha' n't consent to your spoiling your pretty fingers and eyes at any such things!"' "Is that all?" asked Greeta. "That's all I jcould hear, and I've been thinking ever since abou running away." "Oh, let's!' said Greeta, with a countenance full of terror; but Stella was too busily engaged in clearing away sticks, dry leaves, brush, etc., firom the sides of a large dead oak-tree, against which they were piled up, to notice Greeta's last remark,   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    45 and, thrusting her hand into an aperture hitherto concealed by the' rubbish, drew forth a small par- cel, done up in brown paper. "Oh, what's that?" asked Greeta, in astonish- ment. "Is that your play-house?" "Play-house! Great use you and I have for play-houses since step-mother came to live with us! It is something that I love the best of any- thing in the world, excepting my sister and little brother, and mother, if she's alive."  "What is it?" "If you'll wait a minute till I get this undone, I'll let you see for yourself,"' and with that she proceeded to unwrap the paper. "There!" said she, holding up a miniature-case;" do you know those?" "Oh! oh! that's our dear mother, with you and me," said Greeta, first clapping her little red hands with delight, and then seizing the picture and covering it with kisses. "Oh, Stella, where did yon get it?" "Do n't you know?" "No; did you find it in there?" "No; listen, and I'll tell you. Do you remem- ber the day before our mother went away?" "Yes."             / "Well, you know a man came along with a great   "  THE DUIKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. big covered wagon; the draw-bridge was down, and he drove clear up to the door, and got out and came in and showed mother ever so many pictures, and explained them to her, and asked her if she'd like td have some taken? He said that lie could take us all together. She said she'd like it very much, but she had no money. 'Oh, never mind the money,' said he; 'just let me have a good dinner, and let me turn my horses to grass an hour or two, and it'll all be right,' and so she put on her black silk dress, and fixed us all up, and we went out and stood up in the wagon, and he painted this picture. IDo n't you remember it all?" ".I remember of going out into the wagon, but I did n't see him paint anything." "Nor did I, nor anybody else see him; but lie did, or else it painted itself; for after we stood looking at that long brass thing with a glass in it for a little while, he took -out the picture and showed it to us." "Oh, how curious!" exclaimed Greeta, pressing the face of her mother to her lips and murmuring, "Dear, sweet, sweet mother!" "What do you think of that?" said Stella, tri- umphantly holding out an oil-painting, set in gold. It was a miniature of a smiling young girl of six- teen or seventeen. \   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   47 "Oh, that's you, Stella! it looks just like you." "That was our mother before she was married and had trouble. You know everybody says I look like her; but I do n't think I'm as pretty as she is  -here." "You would be if you were dressed like her." "But here is one that looks like you, Greeta, as nearly as a great big man can look like a little girl." This, also, was an oil-painting. "Whose is it?" asked Greeta, eagerly. "I do n't know. Mother loved it dearly, for she used to look at it so much; and once I saw her kiss it, when she thought nobody saw her. It looks so much like you, Greeta! Give them to me now," continued Stella; "I must wrap them up and put them away. Mother was looking at them when we retired the night that she disappeared, and when I waked in the morning I found she was gone; but these were wrapped in this very paper and folded in my arms. I expect she put them there, as much as to say, 'Stella, take care of these!' I did take care of them; I hid them, and no one ever knew I had them till now, And now you know of them, if anything should happen to prevent my coming with you again, you'll know where to find them; and you must take as good care of them as I have, for it's all we've got to   48   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. renmember her by." Here they both wept, while Stella, after wrapping the pictures in the bit of brown paper, carefully nestled them down among the dry leaves in the base of the old tree, and-re- placed the rubbish as she found it. The two then arose in silence, and, wiping their eyes, clasped hands, and began to wend their way homeward-if home such a place might be called. "It's very late," said Stella, glancing her eye up- toward a bright spot, just above the horizon, where the sun was about to set; "I expect we shall get a terrible whipping for being gone so long." "What if she should ask us what we have been about so long?" "We would n't tell her any lie, for I hate lying and all liars!" "We must n't tell her anything about the man, nor the letter, must we?" "Of course not; that will not be necessary." What shall we tell her?" "We can say that we came right away from Sab-  bath-school as soon as it was dismissed, for that was so." "Yes." "And that we got very cold, and sat down be- hind a big tree to get warm, and, after that we /   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     49 walked about and picked winter-greens. Now that won't be any lying, will it?" "No; but if she should ask us if that was all?" "Then we must say that's all we can tell her; and if she whips us to death we must n't tell her any more. But it is n't likely she'll ask us so particu- larly, for I think she'll be drunk, aid I hope fast asleep when we get there. Did n't you see father give her that brandy bottle this morning to comfort her while he was gone?" "No." "Well, he did give her one that would hold at least a quart, and it was full. But there 's the house, we're almost there; and as true as I'm a liv- itg girl! 'there she is, at the door, watching for us! Let's not pretend to see her, but walk as fast as we can, and when we get to lbe gate let's smile antl run right up to her and give her all these winter-greens, and if sheasks us anything about where we've been I'll speak first; and wlheu she comes to you, you must say just what I did. Hush! we mustn't say any more, she'll hear us!" "Wllere've you been, you black serpents?" yelled rather than asked Mrs. Mack, as the two girls came opposite to the gate, at the same time brandishing an immense fishing rod at them. As they neared the door she stepped back to let them enter, giving       ,   ,   50   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. each, as they passed, so severe a blow over the head and shoulders as to make them cringe and scream with pain. As soon as Stella's bonnet and substitute for a shawl were off, and after another dram- was taken,- she repeated the question, "Where have you been all this time, I say?" "Oh1, mother! it was so cold we sat down behind a big tree to get warm, and the time passed away?" "I'll warm you!" screamed the infuriated wo- man, and with that ,she caught Stella by the hair, and pulling her head down between her knees, beat the unfortunate child until she was obliged to stop from sheer fatigue. As Stella sped away from her she turned upon Greeta, but the little girl being closer upon her heels than she expexcted, she stumb- led over' her, falling prostrate on the floor. Being now so far gone in intoxiqation as to be unable to rise, she contented herself by shaking her fist at poor, frightened Greeta, and telling her, as well as her paralyzed tongue would allow her, that she would settle with her to-morrow, spread herself out, panted awhile, and finally sank into a sound, drunken sleep. The two girls, fearing to communicate in the house, not knowing but that this sudden sleep might be feigned, slilpped out after a time, and in the dreary, cold air, with the snow falling fast around them, consulted about the propriety of running away that   THE DUKE'S WON DERFUL ESCAPE.    51 night. But the fatigue they had already undergone that day, the rapid falling of the snow, and the in- creasing coldness of the night, induced Stella's wise little head to counsel waiting till a more favorable time. She thought she could endure it, but feared that little Greeta might give out by the way before they reached a place where they would dare ask for shelter. The project was given up for the present; and so they stole back into the house, and retired, supperless, to their straw bed by the side of their little brother. "Stella!" said Mrs. Mack the next morning, "I guess the crick's froze over so 't you can walk on 't this mornin', so make haste and git the snow swep' out of them paths, and then change your dress and take this butter to Brierwood, and git this bottle full of the best brand and the rest in tobacky. Now, mind what I tell you; and then do you go to the post-office and see if there's any letter for Henry Mack; we ought to' have one with money in't by this time. If you git one, do you be very careful on't. If anybody asks you who the brandy and to- backy is fer, tell'm it's fer your father, for it's likely he'll use his share on 't." "What if the ice won't bear?" said Stella, when about to start. "I want none of your tiresome talk! It will   52   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. bear! and do you go over on 't. Do n't let me see your gret black face here again without the brandy and tobacky! fer I must and will hev some! If you should happen to fall in and git drownded 'twouldn't be no gret loss; only one gret mouth less .to feed 's all." The two little girls stealthily exchanged hasty and agonized good-bye glances, and Stella passed out, indulging the worst fears for Greeta, judging from Mrs. Mack's threat of vengeance the night before and her ominous looks and actions this morning. Mrs. Mack followed Stella out, to add some new directions to those already given. On her return she happened to spy that the ash-house was open and half full of snow. She immediately called to Greeta, and said, as the'child made her appearance, "Did n't I tell you last night to shut that ash-house?" As she spoke she fixed her eyes, with a terrible gaze, on the cowering little thing before her, who looked timidly up and said, "I didn't hear you, mother, or I should have done it." "Did n't hear me, ha?" said Mrs. Mack, adminis- tering several severe blows on the side of Greeta's head. "You did n't hear me, ha? Well, see if you can hear me now, and cover it as soon as possible." Greeta looked for the boards to cover it, but,          J   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   53 alas, they were nowhere to be found! They were buried under the deep snow, and she knew not where. "Why do n't you cover that ash-house, as I tell you to?" "Oh! mother, please do n't blame me! I do n't see the boards." Do n't see the boards, ha? Do n't see the boards? How do you expect to see them, you gret fool, when they're covered up under the snow?" Then seizing her by the hair, and shaking her up and down with full force, until whole handfuls of the child's hair came out, she dragged her along to where the boards lay, and, crushing her down on them head first in the deep snow, with which she covered head and face, she said: "There! now see if you can cover the ash- house!" 'The poor child gathered herself up, and, with her little cold hands, tried with all her might to dig them out, but they would n't move ; they were frozen down fast. She looked imploringly at her step-mother, who unrelentingly came forward with a stick of oven-wood, and again seizing her by the hair, shook her more violently than before, and then beat her unmercifully with the stick until life was almost extinct.   54   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. At this juncture a gentleman opened the gate and walked in. He had watched the proceedings for some time from his sleigh, supposing that the woman was beating a dog; but being unable to sit unconcerned and see so noble an annimal as a dog treated with so much cruelty, he filally con- cluded to come forward and plead in its behalf. When he saw it was a child, and, above all, a little girl, his blood curdled, and it was with the great- est difficulty he could keep his hands off the un- feeling woman. "Git up, you gret fool, and go into the house! there's somebody comin'," said Mrs. Mack, as she saw the getleman get out of his sleigh. Greeta did n't move. "Git up, I tell you, and go in!" Seeing that Greeta did n't move, she took off her shawl and threw it over her so as to conceal her from view, muttering, "I 'll pay you off for this when he 's gone ;" and then walking toward the gate, think- ing to answer his inquiries and prevent his coming in, she smiled sweetly, which she knew well how to do in the presence of a gentleman, as she re- turned his salutation of "Good morning," at the same time stepping in the path before him, as much as to say, "Come no further, but do your errands  and return to your sleigh." Finding the path thus   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.      5 obstructed, he turned out in the deep snow, and, walking directly up to where the little bundle lay, said: "What have you been killing here, a dog?" She gave a little hysterical giggle, as he lifted the shawl and discovered the little lifeless creature. He instantly caught up the child, and, rushing into the house, seated himself at a moderate dis- tance from the fire-lhe was a medical student- and, with the assistance of the guilty woman, who had followed him in, he began to apply such re- storatives as he thought necessary. Finally the little creature showed signs of life. Ono pen- ing her eyes, she shrank with terror from the gaze of her step-mother; and hid her face in the stranger's bosom.  He was very handsome, and knowing his power over the female heart and be- ing something of a philosopher withal, and seeing the impression he had already made on the mind. of the woman before him, and wishing to turn it to the best account, said: "I'm surprised that so beautiful a  woman as yourself should cause this little creature to shud- der so! What does it mean?" Mrs. Mack smiled most angelically, and replied: "She 's always running her head against some- 1   56   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. thing! If she 's a mind to kill herself I do n't see's I can help it." "Judging from what I saw a few minutes be- fore entering your yard, I should think she had some assistance in running her head against some- thing," said he, giving her a look that made her quail. "If I had n't happened along just as I did, this child would have been a corpse by this time, and then what would have become of you, in whom I have already taken a deep interest?" With a most bewitching smile, she remarked: "If it had n't been for this, we should never have met." "That may be true, but for my sake I want you to promise me that you will never abuse this child again. Do you promise?" said he, holding out his hand. She pressed her hand into his, and said, simper- ingly: "I'li do anything for your sake." Having placed the little girl on the bed, he gave sundry directions as to her treatment during the day, and saying he should return soon, placed a small purse of gold at the disposal of Mrs. Mack, and pressing her hand, said: If she recovers soon there 's no knowing what relations you and I may sustain to each other here-   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    57 after; remember all you do for her is for my sake." She looked at him most lovingly, and following him to the door, as he stepped into the sleigh, she whispered to herself, "We were made for each other." He, meantime, wished her at the bottom of the ocean, or any place but where she could abuse that little timid creature, in whonm he felt an unac- countable interest. Greeta lay insensible during most of the day, Mrs. Mack taking but little notice of her except so far as she was obliged to in following out the stranger's directions. The truth is, Mrs. Mack was a child-hater, and she disliked Greeta and Estella more than she did children in general; and all she did for Greeta was induced by her desire of gain- ing the good will of the handsome young stran- ger. Toward night it grew colder, but no appearance of Stella. This seemed to have a very unfavorable effect on Greeta, who, as night approached, grew more and more feverish, calling continually for her sister, and seemed quite flighty, to the great annoyance of her step-mother, who could only keep her hands off of her by thinking of the young doctor, whom she verily believed to be in love with   5 8  THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. her. When it got too late for her to expect his return that night, Greeta was dragged out of the bed and stowed in her miserable pallet of straw, her ravings meantime provoking Mrs. Mack to such a degree that she threatened to give her another "jist sich as she had this morning.* Morning came, and no appearance of Stella. Greeta was replaced on the large bed. About two o'clock the stranger returned, bringing with him an elderly gentleman, whom he introduced as Dr. Quentin. He was a person of great dignity, and kept Mrs. Mack at a proper distance, looking upon her with cold disdain. After warming their hands, they proceeded to examine Greeta's symptoms. They both shook their heads, and expressed fears of a brain fever. After Dr. Quentin had done up suitable medi- cines and given his directions, they took their seats by the fire for a chat. "That was a singular case that happened there on Lalie Island"--Mrs. Mack started and turned pale--' a year ago. You heard of it, I 'suppose?" remarked Dr. Quentin. "No,' retorted the young man. "That's strange, and you such a hand to know all that's going on." "I must have been in England at the time."   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    59 "Ah! very likely, very likely. But there was a great bluster made about it all over the country." "'What was it; you excite my curiosity?" "Well, about six or seven years ago, a man by the name of Forsith, with his wife and two chil- dren-little girls, if my memory serves me right- moved into that house there on Lake Island. They seemed to be nice enough folks, she in particular, only he did n't appear to be in any business. Some said he gambled, and others that he lived on the interest of his money. For my part, I never saw him more 'n once or twice--should n't know him if I should meet him. Well, all at once he went away on a journey; said he should probably be gone two or three weeks, and left her and the chil- dren at home. "Now, it so happened that the very night after he left she disappeared; was-there and well enough when the children went to bed, and in the morning was nowhere to be found. Welljust as the chil- dren were beginning to get very much alarmed, who should come back but Forsith himself! -Ie made a great fuss, and had the neighborhood alarmed. They searched everywhere. At last he suggested looking in the lake, saying perhaps she had fallen in by accident. Well, sure enough, about nine o'clock at night, they found a corpse--he and   60   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. some of his particular friends--dressed in woman's clothes, and he and the children recognized the clothes, but they said the body was so disfigured that the children were not allowed to see it. A coffin was procured-or made, I do n't know which --that night, and a grave dug. Next morning they had a funeral, and the body was buried right there on the island, without any inquest being held over it. Two or three of us went over to remonstrate about the thing being thus hurried through, and to insist on n inquest being held, when, lo and be- hold! he was gone, bag ,-and ba ggage, children and all! There were three of them; one was born on the island. "Well, when we came to look at the grave, we thought it looked very long for her; she was under size. Cur suspicions were aroused, and we had the body disinterred, when, lo and behold! it was a man! and one, too, that had never been drowned. It had evidently been taken from the graveyard; indeed, we afterward found the grave from which it had been taken, and returned it to its original place." "And has the woman ever been heard of?" "I Never." Here Greeta, who for some time had been lying very quiet, moaned and seemed to be in great dis-   THE DUKE'S WO'NDERFUL ESCAPE.    61 tress. The young man went to the bed and took the two little red hands in his, taking particular notice of them. After some further conversation about Lake Island and the mysterious family which had so recently occupied it, they buttoned up their coats, and, giving additional directions in regard to the medicine, the young man stepped up to Mrs. Mack and said: "Madam, I am obliged to leave this part of the country, to be gone several weeks, on business of ium- portance, and I shall have to leave our little friend here in charge of this gentlelnan, in whom I have the utmost confidence, not only as a medical man, but one shrewd in dictating and bringing to light anything else that may be wrong"--at this Mrs. Mack averted her face--" and will make a faithful report to me when I return; and liet me say that then!"--taking her hand and lowering hs voice-- "then, if all has gone right, the little girl better- which will never be without kind treatment-we A&talk over at length, what I mientioned before!" She grinned and pressed his hand, as much as to say her part should be well performed. Dr. Quen- tin said he could n't tell exactly when. he should come again, but, that he was likely to drop in at any time; that he did, not live very far off. She gave them another of her sweet smiles, and the two gen-   62  DTHE DUKE S WONrDERFUL ESCAPE. tiernen took their leave. She watched them from the window, admiring the young stranger, and re- flecting on her own charms, feeling sure that nothing ever induced him to compassionate Greeta but his desire to make her own acquaintance; and as he would very likely measure her love to him by the way she treated Greeta, she at once determined to be kind to her, though she knew it would cost her a great struggle. "He 's a pretty man, and I know we were made for each other!" thought she as she turned from the window. "So handsome, and brave, and polite! Hen. Mack is nothing to be compared to him. Besides, I know he 's rich as a Jew. I could live like a lady with him. Hen. Mack may go to the dogs for what I care! If this young man wants me to run away with him I 'll do it quick enough!"She even felt almost kindly to- ward Greeta for lhaving been the accidental cause of bringing about this new acquaintance. Dr. Quentin was very attentive, coming every day, and sometimes two or three times a day, keeping a strict watch on (reeta's treatment. A week passed, but no appearance of Stella. Mr. Mack, who had returned meantime, expressed great astonishment, but no particular regret in regard to her. He felt slighted at, and was at a loss to account for,   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    63 the sudden cooling off of Mrs. Mack's affections; and on learning that Dr. Quentin attended on Greeta, he immediately left home, alleging as the cause that "he must hunt for Stella."   T.

She walked on and on! The wind whistled about her, utterly disregarding all her thin wrap- pings. She was very cold, and almost felt that she should freeze, but still she walked on. Reaching the creek at last, and finding the ice comparatively firm, she continued to walk fearlessly on, until, when a little more than halfway across the stream, she suddenly went clear up to her arms into a small air-hole, in which condition she remained for more   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    65 than a half-hour, calling at the top of her voice for help until she was hoarse; but no human ear heard her cries, till she was about to' give up in despair, when a sleigh came dashing gayly down the hill, and was proceeding along the road that for some distance ran parallel with the creek. When she heard the sleigh-bells, she summoned all her re- maining strength and courage, and, throwing up one arm, gave a wild. and almost hopeless cry, and knew she was heard, for immediately the bells stopped jingling, and she was enveloped in a warm buffalo-robe and placed in the sleigh, whch turned and hastened back up the hill. But of all these things Stella had no knowledge, having fainted as soon as she saw a prospect of deliverance. On waking to consciousness, she found herself on a clean bed, in a comfortable room, with several kind, anxious-looking elderly ladies bustling about her. Some were wrapping her in heated flannels; one was putting draughts on her feet, and another, with cap and spectacles on, was rubbing her hands and feeling her pulse. "How could such a little thing have come there?" said one. "And so far from home on such a cold day!" added another.   "  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "It's very strange, and so entirely alone, too!" chimed a third. "Well done, if there is n't Mr. Hamilton, with the doctor, now!" "You do n't say " "He's been quick, has n't he!" exclaimed two or three at once, as the sleigh drew rapidly up and stopped in front of the gate. All now made room for the doctor and Mr. Ham- ilton, the former of whom immediately proceeded to an examination of Stella's symptoms, and the latter reading la letter found on her person, think- ing by that means to find some clue as to whom the little girl was. One afternoon, some three months after the above incidents, in a neatly-furnished room, by a cheerful fire, sat a lady, apparently far in the wane of life, engaged in knitting. Near her sat a little girl, ten or twelve years of age, examining the pictures in a large book that lay open on a chair before her. All was still, save that the clock was ticking loudly from the mantle, and the cat was purring quietly in the corner, when the door opened and the lady's husband entered. "Well, I declare! you've come at last, have you? I waited dinner so long for you. I guess you're hungry, ain't you?" said the lady. t   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    67 "Not in the least; I've had my dinner." "Have you? Anid what success in other mat- ters?" "The best in the world;" and then, chucking the little girl under the chin, he said, "Well, Miss Puss, how is it with you by this time? I guess I'll have to keep you here with me. What do you think of that?" The little girl smiled rather than spoke her de- light, and at last stammered out, "I 'd like to stay if my sister could live here too; but-" "But what?" said he. "I do n't believe my father will let me if he knows it." "Let you! Yes he will fast enough, for that's all settled," pulling her to him. "You've seen him, then?" said: the lady. He nodded assent, and continued, "I stepped into Kidder's this morning to warm and see if they'd seen or heard anything of a certain person I've had them on the watch for, when, lo! who should I find there but the very man, that of all others in the world, I wanted to see. Kidder made a great stir, shook hands with me, ordered a serv- ant to make more fire, and, during the commotion, managed to tell me aside that he was confident that that was the gentleman. I, of course, was not   68   THE D UKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. long in making his acquaintance. I called him Forsith at first, but he looked embarrassed and said I was mistaken; that his name was Mack. I begged pardon, and said I thought he bore a strong resemblance to a person whom I once knew by the name of Henry Forsith. He looked ill at ease. I then addressed him as Mr. Mack, and asked him where he was from? whether he had been in the country long? Spoke of schools, and finally of chil- dren; told him I found a little girl nearly in a dy- ing state, some three months since, who gave her name as Stella Forsith, but said her father called himself Mack, and I suggested that she mnight pos- sibly be some relation of his. He said he had heard something about one of his children'being missing, and this might be her. I told him I did n't believe he cared much for her, and that he'd better give her to me, as I had no little girl, and thought I could do better by her than to send her so far, on such a day, so thinly clad, and to crlss a dangerous creek on the ice. He flew into a passion, declared withl an oath that I ' should n't have her,' and said it was nobody's business how he treated his own children! 'Well, then, sir,' said I, you must get her by process of law, for I will not give her up without.' lHe grew very red, and said, 'Then to law I'll go!' ' (ot so fast, my man,' I answered,   THE DUIE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   69 in a tone so low as to reach no other ear than his, 'I have that in my possession which ought to make you quail at even the mention of law! Are you ready to prove this child yours? Are you willing to have it known how she came into your posses- sion?' He became ghastly pale, and was silent. After giving him a few minutes to reflect, I con- tinued, 'Well, sir, what will you do?' He mut- tered something about being poor and a stranger, and perhaps, rather than get into any difficulty, he'd better give her up; at which we shook hands and treated. I asked him if he'd like to step over and see his little girl? He said no; he guessed it was hardly worth while. I added that it would probably be a good while before he'd have another opportunity, as we expected to leave the country soon, perhaps to-morrow. Well, he said he did n't like partings, and would n't come; but he'd like to know what I had in my possession so dangerous to his welfare? I replied that it was in the form of a letter, and as I believed he had another little girl, if he'd let her come and bid her sister good- bye, I would send the letter, sealed up, so that no one could ascertain what it contained. He ag(reed to do so, and then signed this paper, by which he gave up all right and title to Stella." "Then she's ours, is she?" said the lady.   70-  PTHE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Yes, bound to us as tight as a drum! What do you think of that, Missy?" said he, chucking her under the chin again. "I do n't want to be a bound girl!" answered Stella, with some displeasure, "She's not a bound girl, is she, father?" said the lady, laying her arm around Stella's waist. No, indeed; she's our own dear little daughter, and shall never be obliged to stay with us a minute longer than she wishes to. As soon as we get out of the country, she shall have this paper, to do with as she pleases, so she doii't let him knlow it; for all I wanted a paper in the first place was to keep him from troubling us. Had I known cer- tainly that my suspicions were true, I should not have felt the need of s paper. I've a great mind to keep the other little girl when she comes to- morrow, for there is evidently foul villainy in con- templation. Whether they are his or not, he isriot fit to have charge of them. We will take them both, and away to Scotland immediately. I have already written to his grace, and sent him a copy of the letter in hand."   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     71 CHAPTER IV. TST as evening twilight spread its soft yg^^ wings over Wildwood, the day having been unusually mild for the season, Greeta, now so far recovered from her recent illness as to dispense. with Dr. Quentin's professional visits, having fin- ished her supper of cold potatoes and salt, gladly embraced the opportunity of stepping forth into the open air, while her step-mother enjoyed hers of toast and tea. As she looked up into the clear heavens, lit up here and there with a solitary star, a chastened sadness crept over her, and she began, as was her wont whenever opportunity offered, to indulge in tender remembrances of her lost sister. How her soul was moved as the picture of their last sweet walk and talk together came vividly before her mind! And oh, that fond, yearning look, which Stella strained after her, as she passed out of the door previous to commencing her per- ilous journey to Brierwood; it quite overcame her,   72   THE DU7IE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. and seating herself on the door-sill she began to weep. Greeta," said Mr. Mack, having just returned from his' interview with Mr. Hamilton, "do you want to see your sister once more before she leaves the country?" "Oh, yes!" said she, rising hastily, clapping her hands for very joy, and smiling through her tears. "Well, then, if you'll be ready by sunrise to- morrow morning, I'll go with you part of the way. She's living with very rich folks who are going away, and as they want to take her with them, I have just given my consent to let you go and bid her good-bye." With that, he walked into the house, Greeta fol- lowing him with a lighter heart than she had felt for many a day. On hearing the news, Mrs. Mack declared Greeta should n't go. She said: "That i Stell was alive and well all this time, none of the family should go near her! It's likely she's got so stuck up, livin' with them rich folks, that 't aint no ways likely she 'll notice you if you go, or thank you for comin'." Greeta did n't believe any such thing; she was sure she knew her sister better than that! But   THE D UKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   73 was secretly afraid Mrs. Mack would carry the day, and actually prevent her going. A short private interview, however, between Mr. and Mrs. Mack soon obtained that lady's consent, and Greeta set about getting ready. Mr. Mack suggested that she retire early in order to be up before light, as he was unwilling to be detained. Greeta slept but little that night, for joy inex- pressible at the near prospect of seeing her sister on the one hand, and sorrow on the other at the thought that this was probably the last time they would ever meet in this world. She wondered if they should meet in another. The Sabbath-school superintendent's last talk came vividly before her mind. he said, "They might never all meet again in this world, and prayed that they might so live that they might all meet above, saved by grace; that each one of them milght be found at last among that beloved washed throng in the New Jerusalem!" I-er religious knowledge was too limited to ad- mit of her understanding all this, but she knew the difference between saved and lost, and longed to know what was to be her fate, also that of Stella. Having an idea that there was a good deal in dreams, from what she had heard her step-mother   74   TIE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. say, she wished she might have a dream that would settle her mind on this great subject. After tossing about for some time thinking what she should like to dream of-it must be something very unusual-as a sign that she was to be saved, she at last fixed upon a stone house as the most uncommon thing-at least she had never heard of one-and thus she settled the matter with herself. "If I dream of seeing a stone house I shall think I 'm to be saved; and if I see Stella I shall think she's to meet me in heaven." She soon fell asleep, and dreamed she was lost in the wood. She called after her friends, "Stella! oh, Stella! 4Johnnie! Mother! Dear mother!" but no one answered. After awhile she wearied and sat downv to rest, amusing herself with the flowers, birds, and insects about her, and, before she was aware, there came up a terrific storm. She cried for help, and ran hither and thither for a place of safety, clambering over rough fences and through brush, until her clothes were in rags and her hands and feet all torn and bleeding. She was about to give up in despair, when; lo . she beheld one too beautiful to describe beckoning her to him, and with outstretched arms stood ready to receive her. She ran with her hair streaming in the wind, and threw herself sobbing into his arms. He clasped her   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    75 to his bosom, wiped the tears from her eyes, and said she was now his and nothing could harm her any more. He led her away from the scenes of her dif- ficulties and trials out on a beautiful plain, in the midst of which was an elevation, where stood a magnificent stone house, from every part of which gushed pure water, clear as crystal and exceed- ingly sweet to the taste. As she looked, behold! her sister, llittle brother, her own dear mother, Dr. Quentin, and many others whom she had known and loved, were drinking of the water. Her beautiful friend told her that the house was the word of God, and the water was the water of life. She drank of the water, and exclaimed, "Oh! I'm to be saved! I'm to be saved!" and awoke, and found Mr. Mack already up, and calling to her to bestir herself if she was going with him. She was up and ready in a trice, and while he ate his breakfast she ran out to the old tree where the pictures were, and rummaging them out, she put them in her pocket, thinking Stella might want to take them with her, or at least take one more good look at them beforelshe went away. At Wild creek bridge Mr. Mack parted company with Greeta, after having given her such-directions as were necessary to enable her to find the resi- dence of Mr. Hamilton.   76   THE D UKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. When left to herself, Greeta's feet kept pace with her thoughts, now very rapid; indeed, at times she almost flew, as she anticipated with joy her meet- ing with Stella. Then slow, almost standing still, as the thought of their being obliged to separate, and the horrible probability of their never meet- ing again, came over her with sickening force. As she came in front of the house, the door flew open, and a well-dressed little girl came bounding down the walk to meet her. A single glance assured her that it was her long-lost Stella. Greeta stop- ped and gave vent to her feelings in a loud hyster- ical laugh, while Stella ran and embraced her, and made great demonstrations of how glad she was to see her, at the same time regarding her thin features and shabby dress with a peculiar look that puzzled Greeta to understand; it might have arisen from pity, in view of what the poor child had undergone since they parted, or it might have been caused by a feeling of shame that she had such -a looking sister. With their arms twined about each other, they walked to the house, which they had scarcely entered when they were joined by three or four girls of Stella's age and older, who had come to say good-bye, having heard that she was to leave that day. No more attention was now paid to Greeta; who,   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     " after standing till she was 'tired, finally threw her- self into a chair that stood near. Stella chatted merrily with t/ e girls till they were warm, and then led the w y to the swing in the barn. As she passed Greleta, she dropped a letter into her lap, saying: \ "I shall have to send this l/etter to father by you, and I wish you'd take it now, for fear I lose it in the barn," and she passed out, leaving her sister entirely alone in a strange house. Greeta now thought of her step-mother's words, and for the first time in her life she felt sliglited. After waiting half an hour-which her wounded feelings and excited imagination magnified into double that time-without the girls making their appearance, with flushed face and flashing eyes, she rushed from the -house, and ran at a fearfully rapid rate along the street to Brierwood village, through it and away beyond, never stopping until she reached the foot of the hill near Wild creek, in sight of the very spot w where Stella came near losing her life. Here, being t of the way of the wind, and supposing herself out of the reach of human sight or hearing, she came to a stand. As she stood gazing straight before her, her appear- ance was picturesque in the extreme. She had assumed an attitude corresponding with her feel-   78   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. ings--a wild and despairing one. She held her bonnet in one hand, and, having lost her comb in her race, her hair hung loosely and carelessly over her shoulders; the corners of her shawl had blown back, displaying a pair of tiny thin hands, all red and blue with cold, while every lineament of her features showed that a volcanic tempest raged within that little breast. Now disappointment and chagrin, then grief and despair, and anon resentment, mingled with strong and aspiring de- termination, seemed to chace each other succes- sively over her face. At length grief gained the mastery, and she broke forth into loud lamenta- tions, saying: "Oh, I have no friends! Stella do n't love me any more! Nobody loves me! Oh, I have no friends! no friends! no friends!" until articu- lation was completely overpowered by vehe- ment sobs; and wildly 'wringing her hands, she threw herself all writhing with agony of mind across a fallen tree, and was finding relief in a copious shower of tears, when a hand was laid lightly on her shoulder; she heeded it not, and it was lifted only to fall the more heavily, and this time some one said: "What is the matter, my little girl?"   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     79 Rising suddenly, she saw before her a gentleman with a portfolio in his hand. He was slender, graceful, and evidently quite young, while his light hair and fair fresh com- plexion somewhat softened the expression of fea- tures, which might otherwise have seemed-too bold and stern. On his repeating the inquiry, "What is the mat- ter, my little girl?"Greeta looked shy and discon- certed. He seated himself on the spot whence she had just risen, reached out and took one little hand in his, when he sudaenly exclaimed: "Why bless me, if it is n't my little red hand!" Greeta blushed, pulled her hand away, and tried to hide it under her shawl, saying that she could n't help it if it was red. I-e drew her gently to him, and said it was the prettiest kind of a little hand, and nothing at all to be ashamed of, and added: "Why did you weep?"   Greeta looked down. "Have you lost your way?" She shook her head. "Were you ill? Had anything hurt you '" "No, sir." "What then?" "Oh!" said she, in a tremulous tone, "I have no friends!" ,;   80   THE DUKEKS WONDERFUL ESCAPE. ,Oh, you must n't talk like 'that! I'm your friend, and I was just going to see you; I'm glad you 've got so well." '; Are you the one Dr. Quentin meant?" asked Greeta, looking inquiringly into his face. "I expect I am," said he, seating her on his knee. "Have you no parents?" "My mother's gone, and my father do n't love me; he only loves my step-mother!" "I do n't admire his taste much. I'm sure if I owned such a sweet little girl, I should love her the best of anybody in the world! Why bless my heart, how cold you are! You're all of a shiver!" and he gathered her up in his arms and drew her under his cloak close to his bosom, to all of which she passively-submitted. Her bodily energies were. so entirely exhausted from fatigue, mental excite- ment, loss of sleep, and excessive sorrow, that, before he was aware, she was asleep in his arms. He took his own handkerchief and wiped the tears from her cheeks, put back her hair, and, with an eager, philosophic eye, surveyed the contour of her face and head, scanned each feature, examined the little hand and foot. When done, he opened his portfolio, took out a p per, and proceeded to make sundry additions to * I \   THE DUK ES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    81 and alterations in a picture which he had just sketched. It was a fragment of a hill, woody vale, and a noble creek, on the banks of which stood what the ancients might have styled a wood-nymph-a very romantic looking little girl, with bonnet in hand, hair hanging loosely over her shoulders, shawl blown back by the wind, and a face in which was a whirlwind of mental excitement. But, thus incumbered, his task progressed but slowly; an hour passed, and still it was ilnaccom- plished. Suddenly a new thought seemed to strike him; he dropped his pencil and drew a miniature from his pocket with such precipitation as to startle the sleeper; she moaned, threw out her hands, and slept on. After comparing the miniature with the face before him, he was for some time lost in deep thought; his mind seemed to wander to other years, other lands, and other faces. On resuming his pencil, he was presently aware that a pair of penetrating eyes was searching his face. He worked on, without appearing to notice it, until some one said, "I love you." "Do you, ideed? Well, that is cheering!" said he, laying aside his portfolio, and grasping the little speaker firmly in his arms, "and I love you! and   -832 ETHE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. do n't see but we bid fair to be lasting friends. Do you see anything to prevent?" "No!" said Greeta'^,estlipg :her little hand in his, and added, "Do you really love me the best of any- body in thq whole world?" , I do that!" said he, and he was about to bestow a kiss, which, to his apparent surprise, was decidedly rejected.  "What?" said he, "love me, and not let me kiss you? How's that?" "My sister says I mustn't let the boys be kissing me!" "Well, but I 'm not a boy though." It 's all the same!" said she, after a moment's reflection. He looked grave, relaxed his hold of her, and again took/up the picture. After a short silence, which, to Greeta, was almost painful, she said, "Don't you love me any more now?  "Indeed I do!" said he, looking gratified and touching her cheek with his forefinger; "but I'm afraid you do n't love me much, for folks are always willing to kiss those they love; are they not?" "That's not the way I do ", "How do you- do?"  "Why, I just love them without-any kissing,"   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     83 (Actions speak louder than words.' If you tell foilks you love them and don't act accordingly, they 'll think you're only pretending." "Do you think I'm only pretending?" "No, indeed! I think you are as honest a little girl as I ever saw," he said, caressingly; and this time he actually did steal a morsel of the forbidd(en fruit. "Oh, forgive me! I did it before I thought! Did it hurt you?" "( 'o!" said Greets, struggling to free herself. "C h, sit still!" said he, holding her with a firmer grasp than before. "I'll never kiss you again with- out your consent!" She ceased her fruitless efforts, feeling assured, from his manner, that he really was her friend. He noticed her trembling, and felt real regret for the mischief he had donle, and sought to divert her thoughts from the subject by asking her how she came to be out there all alone on such a raw day. "I've been to see my sister Stella." "Where is your sister Stella? I thought you said you had no friends!"    \ "She's at Mr. Hamilton's; but she's not my friend any more!" "How's that? Have you and she had a falling out?" "No, sir."   84   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Then what makes you think she's not your friend any more? "Because she did n't act as though she was." "Ah, ha! Then you think, ' Actions speak louder than words,' do you? She did n't kiss you, did she?" "Yes, she did; but she did n't act as though she loved me after that; for when some other girls came she talked all the time to them, and asked them to take off their things and to sit down and warm, while I stood there with my things all on, clear back from the fire, and she never asked me to sit down, or take off my things, or warm myself. And after a while she took them out to the barn to swing, and left me all alone!" "And what then?" asked he, deeply interested. But Greeta was crying. "Oh! I would n't lay it to heart so. Stella will make it all up next time." "I shall never see her again! for she 's going to move away with Mr. Hamilton's folks to-day. Oh, my dear sister!" sobbed she, "I shall never see her again!" "Did you come away without bidding her good- bye." "Yes, sir." "Was that what made you feel so grieved when I found you?" !    THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    85 Y es, sir; that was part of it!" "Oh, well! I would n't cry any more. I guess I'll have to take you home with me if you have no friends Would you like to go?" "Yes, sir," said she, brightening, "if my father would let me." "He need n't know anything about it. Go right off with me now when the carriage comes." "Is there a carriage coming?" "Yes; I 'm expecting it along every minute." "And then are you going away in it?" "Yes; won't you go with me?" 'I'm afraid to go without my father's know- mg it'" "And yet you say he do n't love you?" "By the way, you haven't told me youf name. What is it?" "Greeta Forsith." "Greeta!" repeated he thoughtfully, and then wrote it under the picture he had been sketching. Greeta wanted to see the picture. He showed it to her. She looked about her. "It looks some- thing like this place," she said at last. - "And who is this?" he asked, pointing to the little girl.   86   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "I do n't know!" said she, after scrutinizing it for some time. "Is n't it your sister?" "Oh, no! I guess it is n't; for she is a great deal larger and wears prettier clothes!" "Iow old is your sister?  "She's ten; she'll be eleven next fall.' "How old are you?" "I'm most eight; I 'll be eight next fall." "Why you're little! I thought you were only six! Then you don't know this little girl?" "No, sir." "I do!" and he pointed to the name he had just written. "Can you read that?" She shook her head. "It 's Greeta!" "Is that me?" "That's you!" "I did n't know I was as pretty as that!" "I did, and I want to take you with me. You need n't mind that old scalawag of a father! lHe can't get you away from me if I once get you into my possession." "The Bible says children shall obey their pa rents." "Did you ever read that?" f-   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    87 ",No, sir; my Sabbath-school teacher tofd rse it was there." "So you think you can't go?" "I will when I get to be a large girl." "When you get to be, a woman, do you mean?" Yes, sir." "Good for you! Now, see't you remember it," said he, patting her on the shoulder; "and if. any other fellow comes for you, just tell him that you're engaged." What does engaged mean?" "Promised. You're promised to me, are you not?" "Yes, sir." "Now, when I call for you, shall I find you've gone off with somebody else?" "Will you be sure and call?" "I will that! Will you go with me?" "If I 'm a grown up woman I will. "Good! it's a bargain!" He now began to put away-his pencil and picture. "I've got some pictures, too," said Greeta, pro- ducing the brown parcel which she had taken from the old tree that morning. "Have you?" said he. "May I look at them?" And she handed him the one of her mother lead- ing Stella and her.   88   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "This smallest one is my little red hand," said he, playfully. 'Who are the others? That lady's countenance is familiar to me, and yet I can not, at this moment, say who she is." "It's my own dear mother, painted the day be- fore she went away; and that one is Stella." "Is n't your mother dead?" "I don't know for certain. Stella thinks she is n't, for she says she do n't believe she'd go and drown herself on a dark night, and the grave was too long for my mother. And I've heard, since Stella went away, that they opened the grave, and there was a man in it. I do n't know but I dreamed it though?" said she, putting her hand to her fore- head, as if trying to recall something. "I guess you heard Dr. Quentin tell me about a grave at Lake Island." "That's it! That's just where they said my mother was buried! We used to live there before we came here to Wildwood." He eyed her keenly, and seemed in deep thought. She then handed him her mother's miniature, and began telling him how much Stella looked like it, when her attention was arrested by his exclaiming, "The Duchess of Groveland, as I 'm a living man!" "It's not a Dutch woman! It's my own dear,   THE DUKEXS WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     89 sweet mother before she was married, and had trouble." The gentleman was too full of his own thoughts, and too much excited, to notice Greeta's last excla- mation. "And this is your mother, is it?' "Yes, sir." "Well, I believe it, for the little girl, your sister, bears a strong resemblance to her; and I now recog- nize the lady in the group to be the samle." "And this," said Greeta, "Stella says, looks ex- actly like me." "In the name of goodness! my little girl, how did you come by this?" "It was my mother's-she loved it so much! And once Stella saw her kiss it when she thought nobody was in the room." "Why," said he, "it's the exact counterpart of this picture of mine," taking it from his pocket, and placing them side by side. "Whose is yours?" asked Greeta. "Why, bless your little heart, it's the great Duke of Groveland." "Do I look like it?" "You do that. But what's this?" he asked, holding up a letter that lay at his feet. "Is it I yours?" I t    90   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Oh, yes; that's a letter that a great big fat man, with black eyes, gave to Stella, and told her not to let anybody see her give it to father; and he said she must n't let any one know she had the letter. That was last fall, and she has n't given it to him yet; and she gave it to me this morning to give it to him."' "It's so long since, 't is n't likely he'll want' it; you'd better give it to me." "Oh, that would n't do; I must give it to him," said she, decidedly. "I declare, that carriage ought to be here by this time," said he, looking at his watch. "Supposing you run to the top of the hill, and see if you can see anything of it, andI I'll hold these things while you go. But stop, do n't run so; it's too tiresome for a little thing like you." During her absence he opened the envelope and hastily read the letter, which he then put in his pocket, and, after reflecting a moment, he wrote a few lines on another sheet of paper, and sealed it in the same envelope. He also substituted some of his pictures for hers. When she returned, saying something about the coachman's not doing his duty, he handed Greeta her parcel and letter, all of which she put into her pocket.   THE DUKI'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    91 He said no more about her going with him, but stood holding her hand firmly in his, and looking stern and abstracted; Greeta, meanwhile, peering timidly up into his face, from time to time, as if wondering what could possibly have caused so sud- den a change in his manner. The carriage came at last, recalling his attention, and he said to Greeta, "Come now, and get into the coach, and I'll have the coachman drive to your home. Oh, you little sylph," said he, as he lifted her in, with an attempt at gayety, and, stepping in himself, gave directions to the driver as to where they were to stop; the door was shut, and they set off pretty rapidly. Without saying a word to Greeta, except, "How cold you-are," he took her on his lap, wrapped his cloak about her, and then sat with the same stern, absorbed look during all their ride. They did not drive clear to the house, but only to the foot of the hill on which it stood. When the carriage stopped, "Kiss me," said he, in a peremptory tone. Without questioning his right to make the demand she obeyed. Their lips met, and in a moment more Greeta stood on the ground. AKhasty "Bye-bye!" from him, and a tremulous "Good-bye!" from Greeta, and the carriage was on its way back to Brierwood.   92   THE DUKES WONDERFUL' ESCAPE. Before proceeding far, however, the "gentleman called on the driver to stop and look about him. "Do you know this place?" "Yes; as well as I know any place." "You 've been here before, then?" "Often often! I 'tinded two wakes in that same house,'whin ould Mike Flanagin-p'ace to his soul!--was livin' there." "Do you know this family?" "Niver saw a livin' soul of thim till this blissed day!" "Well, can't you keep an eye on them?" "I can, yer honor!" winking with one eye. "And for a consideration, if you see anything like moving away, let me know?" "I could aisily do that same if I knew where yer honor wus." "I shall be-let me see-well, I can get a letter addressed to me at Toronto, Canada." "But, yer honor, I can't write anything but my namne!" "Well, that will be all-sufficient. Just put your name on a sheet of paper, folded in an envelope, and get almost any one to direct to me, Toronto, Canada. I shall understand it." "I'll do that very same, yer honor!"   THE DUKEtS WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     93 "Drive on, then, and be sure that you keep your word! You shall be well rewarded." The coachman again winked, touched his hat, cracked his whip, and away they went. Feeling a desire to get another glimpse of the house, the gentleman looked through the window at the back of the carriage, and saw a man dart from behind a tree near where the above conversation was held. , ..  .        .    "  THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. CHAPTER V. INSTEAD of proceeding immediately to tle. house, Greeta took a circuitous route to the old tree, for the purpose of depositing the pic- tures in its base. She met Mr. Mack at the door, and handing him' the letter, was about to explain in regard to it; but he told her that he knew all about it, and waved his hand impatiently, as dis- pensing with any remarks. When he read the letter, he laughed outri hrt; and exclaiming, "The old fool! if he thinks there is anything in this letter to frighten me, lie's grandly mistaken; at least, there's no danger un- less it should happen to fall into certain hands in England. He 's given his full and right name! It's a little singular, too; I never knew him to be so imprudent before. He's getting careless- that's just the way such things leak out. I'm not half as much disturbed about that as I am about something I heard not an hour ago." "What was it?" asked Mrs. Mack. "I'll tell you at a more suitable time," said he,   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    95 glancing his eyes at Greeta and John, who were sent to bed at an unusually early hour. After the children were supposed to be asleep, the two worthies held a long and earnest conver- sation, which resulted in Mrs. Mack's packing her satchel, and making other preparations for a jour- ney. When Greeta awoke in the morning they were at breakfast, she with her bonnet on. The stage horn was at length heard in the distance, and they passed out without saying anything to either of, the children. He, however, came back after a few minutes, saying that he and their mother were going a short journey, to be gone a few days, and they must be good children, and take good care of the house, and not on any account go to any of the neighbors; that if they did he sh:ould have to at- tend to them when he came back. Greeta and John did as well as could be expected of two such children, suddenly left entirely alone on a bitter cold day, with barely wood enough to make one fire, and nothing cooked for them to eat-Mrs. Mack put the remains of breakfast into a basket to take with them for a lunch. The little girl, though only seven, feeling responsible for the good order of the house, and a little lifted up at finding herself sole mistress of the establishment, was not long in boiling a few potatoes, which she   96   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. and her little brother ate with some buttermilk that she knew Mrs. Mack intended for their break- fast. She rolled up the little old, ragged straw bed, and tucked it away under the large one, which latter she made up as well as her height would al- low of; then, after sweeping the floor as clean as broom wielded by such little hands could make it- under the andirons and all-the two drew up to what fire there was, and began to talk over the re- cent transactions; of Stella, wishing she was pres- ent, and of their own dear mother, Greeta telling him all she could respecting her. Three o'clock! The fire is all out, and the children go to bed to keep warm. But the weather is so cold that their little straw bed is not sufficient; they get in the large one, where there are two feather ticks, and comforts in abundance. Hlere they are warmed, but not fed. Three-seven-ten days have passed, and Mr. and Mrs. Mack have not returned! The weather is still severe, and the children are in bed and too feeble to rise, having eaten nothing during all this time, excepting a few dried fruits, which at first they dare not eat, fearing what might be the con- sequences when their step-mother returned; nor would they ever have done so, had not the gnaw- ings of hunger overcome their prudence. It is   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    97 nearly noon; there is a loud rap at the door, and some very heavy stamping to get the snow off. Another rap. ' Come in!" said a faint voice, as an emaciated little face peeped from under the bed- cover. "Hallo! what, in bed yet? Why, bless my soul! here it is almost noon. Oh! it's the little girl, is it?" slightly changing his tone. "Where's all the folks? Where's your father?" "He 's gone "-she finished by going into a swoon. "H a! fainted? Oh! sick, is it?"When he saw how thin she was, and not finding any water, he flew to the -door for some snow to rub in her face. "Ha! you're there too, are you, sir " What's the matter with your sister?" "She's so hungry! we're both so starved!" said the little fellow, attempting to rise; but his lips turned very white, and he fainted, too, and had to have some snow applied to his face. "Starved, are they? Poor things! they look as though they were. I guess this will relieve them." And taking from the breast pocket of his overcoat a bottle of brandy, he poured some into a tea-cup, and gave each of them a sip, which had the desired effect. He also gave them a few crackers that he had put into his pocket for a lunch, as he expected   98   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. to take a long ride in the cold before he returned home. Then, possessing himself of an ax and a couple of chamber-floor boards, soon had a rousing fire, over which he hung a tea-kettle of water, scarcely knowing why he did so; and then-run- ning his fingers through his hair and righting his shirt collar-he said to himself, "I be hanged if I know what to do next! I never was a nurse in my life! AhI that's just what I'll do!"-as a new thought struck him-"I'll ride right over to Fogg's, and get his wife to come and nurse the little things up." So, giving them each another sip of brandy, and telling them to lie still and eat their crackers while he went for some one to come and take care of them, he set out It was Mr. McCurdy, their landlord, a Scotch- man by birth, and though rather rough in his gen- eral appearance and manner, was possessed of a brave, generous; and compassionate heart. "A pretty piece of business!" said he, as he mounted his horse. "If I had n't happened in just as I did they'd a been dead corpses! I do n't believe they'd a lived till night! That man ought to be gibbeted! Gone nearly two weeks! and left them two little, helpless things all alone and without anything to eat or anything to make a fire, and then charged them not to go to any of the neighbors. Blast   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    99 him! if I only had hold of him once-and that cursed Jezabel of a second wife! hanging is too good for her. I should hate to see a decent gibbet disgraced by having her on it; confound the cursed hag! I haven't forgotten how she treated that other little girl there, the one that Hamilton carried off. I should n't mind taking this one myself; she's a pretty little thing, and they say her mother was, as fine a little woman as you-'d wish to see. That boy is a bright dog, too! I'll enter a complaint to the overseers of the poor! that's what I will. They sha'n't stay there another day if they're able to to be moved!" Toward the middle of the afternoon Mrs. Fogg, a great, big woman, with a fat baby in her arms, made her appearance, and close behind came Mr. Fogg, holding an ax across his shoulders with one hand, and in the other a basket containing a loaf of bread, some butter, sugar, coffee, and a piece of fresh mutton. Mrs. Fogg soon made things look homelike and cheerful. They stayed all night. Next morning two gentlemen called, one of whom was a doctor, and he said all in the world that ailed the children was starvation; that with good nurs- ing they would soon be about; but that great care must be taken lest they should eat too muchnow in their weak state. The other was the poor-master,   100  THE DUIKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. who stipulated with Mrs. Fogg to stay with them till they were able to walk, and then take them to her house until suitable places could be obtained for them in case their father did not come home in the meantime. It was a delightful evening in early April. Mrs. Fogg, who had spent nearly three weeks with the children, feeling anxious about her own household affairs, had returned home right after breakfast, and told the children to follow, at their leisure, some time during the day. Greeta was of the opinion that they had better not be in a hurry about leaving the house, as their father and step-mother might possibly come that day. Accordingly they waited for the last rays of the evening sun to disappear, and not until the heavens were brilliantly lighted up with stars did they start for their new home. They were almost there. So near that they could hear the cry of the lambs from the sheep- cot and Mrs. Fogg's, "Get out, sir! and stop so much barking," to her dog, Strap, who was hold- ing forth at the full moon, which was now up, iaking everything look beautiful with her soft, white light. They could almost see the smoke curling up from the chimney of Mrs. Fogg's log house.   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   101 They paused a moment to survey the scene, and were about to proceed, when away down the road they saw two human figures moving toward them. Being afraid, they shied into the fence corner to get out of sight, but were not soon enough-they had already been observed. The distant objects, which proved to be a man and woman, were soon upon them. "In the name of heaven! Gret and John, is that you out here at this time of night?" said a stern, masculine voice. John answered. Greeta was too much agitated; for, had a can- non been discharged at her side, she could not have been more startled than she was at thus suddenly hearing her father's voice, and in such a tone. "Where under the heavens are you going instead of staying at home and taking care of the house, as I told you to do?"  "To Mrs. Fogg's," said John. "To Mrs. Fogg's, indeed," thundered Mr. Mack. "Yes; Mrs. Fogg said we must come." And the poor-master said so, too," added Greeta. "The deuce he did! Well, you can just turn round and take yourselves home again, while I cut a couple of good switches to teach you to mind me instead of Mrs. Fogg. And let any poor-master   .   ;   M! 102  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. tshow his head about my house while I'm there and see what he 'll get."  "Yes," said Mrs. Mack, "hurry home and git a  good fire started aginst we git there; for it's likely  yer father'n' I'll want somethin' to eat, after havin' nothin' sence noon. Sha'n't I he'p you?" she added tauntingly, and between her teeth, as Greeta stag- gered and fell over, and taking hold of her arm, as if to lift her up, gave her such a pinch as made her scream with pain. "I'll pay you fer that scream, if it ain't in six months," she said, without in the least relaxing her hold. Supper was got, but the children were sent to their little straw bed without any, and very soon after the two whips were brought into contact with their naked limbs. Both felt that they were whipped without cause, but Greeta was exasperated. All the energy and resentment of her nature were aroused; her heart and head throbbed with excitement; every nerve and muscle quivered in view of the indignity she had received! She thought she did n't love either of them a particle! She never did, and, what was more, she never should! She hated them both! She 'd run away-that's what she would! She '4 get up and go that very night, just as soon as sle   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    103 was sure they were all asleep! They should i't have a chance to whip her for nothing again! She tossed about in a high fever, until she thought that they must certainly be asleep. She held her breath and laid very still to listen,- but knew no more till broad daylight next morning, when she was awa- kened by a sound box on the ear, and a "Git up! you gret, lazy fool, and not lay there all day!" from \ her step-mother. At the breakfast table, Greeta's face wore a troubled, timid expression, and her eyes showed traces of recent tears. "What's the matter now?" asked Mr. Mack. Her answer was prevented by Mrs. Mack's saying: "I did expect to have some stewed raspberries for breakfast, but, lo and behold! when I come to get 'em there wa' n't any!" "How's that?" asked he. "It's more'n I can tell; ask Greet." "Where are they?" demanded he, fiercely. "Oh, father! Johnnie and H." She could say no more, for his terrible look and tone paralyzed her. She turned very pale, and began to weep. "Ate them, I suppose!" said he, as he threw a co-fee-cup with its contents full into her face. She gave a cry of terror and pain, and rushed from the table and out of the house.   104   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Well, we hadn't anything else to eat!" said John, with indignation. "Leave the table, sir!" said his father, at the same time giving him a smart blow across the mouth. He ran out to his sister, who had repaired to the spring to bathe her face, "Oh, Johnnie!" said she," if I 'm missing some day, you must think I've drowned myself, for I can't bear it much longer!" "I never 'd drown myself for such as they!" said he, throwing a stone with great force at nothing. Mr. Mack came out, to start for Mr. McOurdy's, and passing near the children, ordered them into the house-a very unwelcome command as far as Greeta was concerned, her step-mother having promised her a, whipping as soon as her father was gone, on account of the raspberries; which promise she immediately fulfilled to the letter, and said: "Now see if you can't go snivelin' round all day if you want another jist sich! Stop yer cryin' and wash yer gret black face, and then finish washin' them dishes; and see't you git 'em done, and the floor scrubbed up, afore I git back, fer I'm goin' out, and John's goin' with me." GOreeta watched them till the trees hid them from view, thinking, "Good-bye, dear little brother,   -THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   105 you 'll never see me again!" Then, finishing the dishes, she changed her dress, ran to the old tree for the pictures, then to the back of the house into the woods, and toward Wild creek, intending to follow it up to the bridge, cross over, and make the best of her way to Lake Island, knowing that her lather would be very chary about going there to seek her. A heavy rain had fallen during the lat- ter part of the night, causing the creek to overflow its banks, so that when Greeta came opposite to the bridge it looked like a tiny islahnd in the midst of a wide expanse of water. What was to be done? It did not take long, in her state of mind, to decide; she pressed directly forward, and passed over in safety, though she waded through muddy water up to her waist. With clothes dripping wet she merged into the highway, when whom should she meet but Mr. McCurdy! He knew her, and called out; she heeded not, but rushed past him with the fleetness of a deer. About noon, feeling thirsty and faint, she stop- ped at a respectable-looking log house, and asked the only inmate she saw for a drink. "Does it hurt you to drink?" asked the old lady. "Yes, ma'am; my throat is very sore. Oh, my head! my head!" she continued, pressing her hand on her forehead.   106   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "I do n't wonder your head aches, with such a bruise as that on it. How did it happen?" I'd rather not tell," said Greeta, turning pale and tottering. "Sit down; you 're faint," said the lady, looking alarmed. "Is this the road to Lake Island?" asked Greeta, after recovering a little. "Yes, it's the road; but, my dear child, it's al- together too far for such a little thing as you to think of going there alone\ and on foot, even if you were well; You must not think of stirring another step to-day, for you're a very sick child!" as she took her finger from Greeta's pulse. "Oh, I must! I must!" exclaimed Greeta, rush- ing toward the door, fearing the possibility of being detained by force until her father should find and take her home to her step-mother again. The good woman watched her till she was out of sight, and long after did she continue to gaze in the direction that Greeta had taken. "Poor child! poor child!" she said at length, " she's very sick; I should n't a bit wonder if she fell dead in her tracks! But what could I do? If I'd used force it might have made her worse. When Mr. Mole comes home I'll send him to see what 's be-     ,   .   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    107 come of her, for I 'm sure she can't get far in such a state." Greeta walked until, completely exhausted, she sank down in a fence corner. /    108 -THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. CHAPTER VI. H dear!" said Greeta, "I must be going on, or I shall never reach Lake Island to- night!" but stopped in surprise on finding that, instead of being in the fence corner of a road lead- ing through a lonely wood, she was on a soft, com- fortable bed, in a little whitewashed bed-room of a log house, her soiled clothes having given place to a clean night-dress, and her hair not lying in tangled masses about her head, but all shaved off. On the' stand with its white cover was a tumbler, tea-spoon, and several vials. The early sunlight was peeping modestly through the green, dewy, rustling foliage of a noble hop-vine that spread it- self with great magnificence in front of the open window. The quiet of the room was unbroken, save by a sound very like the faint murmur of a miniature waterfall, which proceeded from a neigh- boring bee-hive, and was relieved at intervals by the distant notes of birds wafted into the room on the wings of the fresh morning breeze. But looking and listening soon made Greeta   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    109 dizzy, for she was very weak; so she lay down again and turned her face to the wall, closed her eyes, and was for some time lost in a kind of dreamy wonderment.  "How is she this morning, Doctor?" asked some one, in a subdued tone. "Better, I think; decidedly better." "Thank God! Oh, if she only lives to forgive me!" replied the first speaker. "But you must keep out of her sight. Seeing you in her present weak state might bring on a re- lapse, which I have no doubt would prove fatal," said the doctor. Greeta, who thought she recognized the voice of the first speaker, opened her eyes and turned over; but they had passed out, and she saw no one but the kind old lady at whose house she called to get a drink, and who now smiled, patted her on the cheek, and asked if she felt better. "Ho w did my hair come to be cut off?" asked Greeta. "It was done because you were so sick, my dear. The doctor ordered it. But you must n't talk dear, for you are better now, and the doctor says you must be kept very quiet, or you 'll get worse again. A relapse is always to be dreaded." I   "O  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. Greeta again composed herself to rest, wondering what relapse meant. "Won't you please tell me all about how I came to be here" asked Greeta, one pleasant afternoon, after she began to sit up, and she and Mrs. Mole, and Mrs. Fogg-who had come over to see how she got along-were all sitting out on the porch. "Do n't think anything about that, darling, but be thankful that you are among friends, and are getting so well," said Mrs.- Mole, as she passed out to see about getting tea. "She's afeard to tell you for fear you'll feel bad," said Mrs. Fogg, in a half whisper. "But I'll tell you, for I think you ought to know. I'm sure I'd thank anybody to tell me, if I was in your place. The fact is, your step-mother whipped you so 't we did n't dare to leave you with her for fear she'd kill you." "How did she find me?" "She did n't. Do you mind a callin' here for a drink of water?" Yes." "Well, Miss Mole see 't you wa' n't well then, and felt quite uneasy about you, and when her husband come home to his dinner she told him about you, and sent him to look along the road to see if he could see anything of you; and sure   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   1" enough, there you was, a moanin' away in the fence corner, and did n't know nothin' at all. So Le picked you right up in his arms and fetched you to the house, and Miss Mole she tended and nursed you up, a givin' you warm drinks, and everything she could think on, and kept a watchin' out for the doctor. She'd seen him drive past in the mornin' and knew he'd be back; and sure enough, along toward night she seen a wonderful dust a risin' and pretty soon here come the doctor, and she called him in. He said right off' t he knew you, and knew where you lived, and that he guessed he'd better take you hum, for he thought you was a goin' to have a pretty serious time on 't. Well, so she fixed you up and he started with you. On his way back he stopped at our house and told me about you, and said he wished I'd go right over and try to do somethin' for you. 'For,' says he, 'that jade of a step-mother do n't seem inclined to do anything for her. I found her half drunk, and she shook her fist at the poor, unfortunate child, and swore she'd pay her off good for to- day's capers.' He said he was afraid to leave you alone with such a sarpent, and he did wish I could go over and stay all night. I promised him I'd go as soon as I could, but I could n't go jest that minute, as I had some chores to do first.' So   "2  THE DUKE S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. I told Fogg to go right over and keep her from killin' of you till I come. Jest as Fogg got there he met old McCurdy; he told him what was to pay, and they both went in together. "The first thiiig I saw when I got in sight of the house, was McCurdy pushing her out by the shoulders, and tellin' her never to put foot in that house again. She declared she would go in jest as often as she pleased. As soon as I was in they barred the door till we could do somethin' for you. But oh, such a sight as you was! The Satan-for I can call her nothin' else-had beat your poor little head almost to a jell. You was black and blue all over, and the blood was streamin' down your back from the great gashes she had cut in your head.

"I had them bring you right over to my house, and we worked with you all night, tryin' to keep the breath of life in you till the doctor come. He fetched Miss Mole with him when-he come. She see 't I had but one room, and a good many noisy children, so she said't you'd better be brought here where everything is quieter like, and she had more time to take care of you nor I had, and she's been very kind to you.

Here Mrs. Mole made her appearance, inviting them out to tea.    THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   115 CHAPTER VII. VERYTHNG was jubilant with life, light, and happiness! The cold, heavy hand of winter was lifted, and nature's pulse was beating again; its laboratory was fairly open, and the great master Artist at his work; not blusteringly, but nev- ertheless industriously and surely, giving a touch here and there, and a stroke yonder, until the earth looked green and thrifty; and now, as it basked in the genial rays of the morning sunlight, every dewy leaf and blossom glittered as if set with gems. The whole animal creation seems to be aware of the fact that it is spring, and each in its own pecu- liar way manifests its joy. The birds see it, and vie with each other in singing their delight! Man knows it and looks glad-is inspired with new life!  That solitary horseman traveling in thoughtful mood through a farming country in Canada West, being at length roused to the beauty of the scene, looks, listens, and is charmed.   "6  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. Riding along past an orchard in full bloom, he reached up and plucked a twig from an apple tree that extended its branches over the fence at the road-side. He examined it with an artistic eye, admired the perfection of its workmanship, the matchless carv- ing and chiseling of its leaves, the delicately- formed blossoms, its exquisite tinting, and, above all, the transcendent wisdom displayed in its inter- nal economy for propagating its species! "Who made this beautiful 'thing?" was his mental inquiry. "Who was ,ever heard or seen making a twig or a tree? Andyet they had a maker, for such marks of design could never result from chance!" His thoughts rose; his eye glanced upward! He gazed up into the heavens as if determined to penetrate to the abode of this invisible Author. A new thought struck him-his countenance changed; there was in his face desire, yearning, beseeching. Is he praying? Is he asking for assistance in the difficult undertaking in which he is about to embark, and about which he has been so much perplexed? And will he be answered? Will God answer the prayer of an alien, though it be uttered in faith? He dropped the twig and rode up to a group of workmen, just leaving the field to go to their break-   THE :UKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    17 fast, and inquired if they could direct him to ' Thorncliffs Private Lunatic Asylum?" Having been duly informed that the asylum was at Oak Ridge, full twenty miles distant; that there was not a house on the way; that the long weari- some road led through an uninhabited country, mostly woods, and that robberies and murders had been committed on it, he set forward, leaving the group under the impression that, to use their own language, "he was. a very dacent spoken young gintleman." One declaring it to be his belief " he was a rale lord." "And how do you know that, Mike?" said an- other. "How do I know, is it?" said Mike, "sure and aint he as like as two pase to his own father, old Lord Ransthler, that rode through the strates of Belfast only a week before myself was afther sailin' for Ameriky?" Without meeting with any special adventure, except that both himself and horse became very much jaded, about three o'clock in the afternoon, in the midst of a severe thunder-storm, our traveler arrived before the walls of the asylum Finding the gates locked, and unable to make himself heard above the storm, though he shouted loudly for admittance, he employed his time as   "8   THE DUK ES WONDERFUL 9SCAPE. well as he could for the rain in viewing the prem- ises. The spot was beautiful and romantic. Not a building in sight save those belonging to the asylum. On the east were enchanting green fields; on the north, green fields, and a little fairy lake, surrounded by clumps of trees; on the west and south, green fields traversed by a noble creek - the outlet of the lake. Beyond all these, away in the dim distance, was an unbroken circle of forest trees. The building itself stood on a delightful rise of ground, gradually sloping off to the distance of a quarter of a mile either way, surrounded by a high brick wall, which was surmounted by long and very sharp iron stakes, so that no one could ci'oss it with- out injury. The grounds were traversed by narrow, winding paths and broad gravel walks, pleasantly shaded by a great variety of trees, from the tall oak and maple and other forest trees of more than a century's growth, down to the fruit and locust trees planted within the last five or six years. Besides, there were not wanting artificial foun- tains, summer houses, and rustic seats placed about under the trees, on which the tired pedestrian might rest at pleasure.  In short, no pains were spared to make the place   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    119 as attractive as possible to persons having insane friends. Though it was spring, the day had been hot and sultry and exceedingly oppressive to the inmates of the asylum, who, notwithstanding the ample pro- visions made for them, were seldom permitted to walk in the fresh air. Along in the afternoon a terrific thunder-storm arose. The rain came down in torrents, the wind blew with frightful force, and the thunder and lightning were indeed appalling. After about an hour the clouds that had been waging this terrible war separated, and having un- furled their seven-colored flag of peace, set all sail for the north-east, when the front door opened, and an old gray-haired man made his appearance. After standing at the door for a few minutes, as if enjoying the sweet, refreshing breeze, he with dif- ficulty made his way down the steps, the chains about his feet rattling as he walked. After proceeding a few yards he turned for a mo- ment, and glancing up toward the grated window, smote his forehead, and, as he continued his walk, exclaimed with vehemence, "How long! oh, Lord! how long! how long! shall her majesty's rational subjects be deprived of Thy choicest blessings? How long shall they be deprived of the privilege of v   120  THE DUIKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. walking abroad on Thy beautiful green earth and breathing the blessed and refreshing air of heaven?" Thus he continued, speaking louder and louder, till he finally shouted at the top of his voice, tear- ing his hair, beating his head with his fists, and almost foaming, "Oh, Lord! how long! how long,!" until he reached the great iron gate, when his attention was attracted by our horseman, who sat intently watching him. The lunatic started, and with a smile of recogni- tion touched his hat, bowed, and exclaimed, "Lord Ransler, as I'm a living man!" "The same," said the horseman. "But, my friend, you have the' advantage of me. By whom have I the honor of being addiessed?" touching his hat and bowing in turn. "Ha! ha! There 's where we plebeians have you of the nobility! We often know you, whereas you seldom know us. But come, my lord; come near enough for me to reach through the gate, for it is locked, and get hold of your button., said he, in a half whisper, and I'll soon remind you who I am. Do you remember of once taking a trip from Liver- pool to New York, on the ship Regal?" "Aye! I do, sir. I have good cause to remember it well," said Lord Ransler, at the same time eyeing the lunatic to see if he could make him out. I   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    121 "Well," said the latter, his nostrils quivering, with emotion, "do you remember a certain large box un- der the care of some half dozen pretended Ama- zons?" "I rather think I do!" said his lordship with em- phasis. "Do you remember the foremost man who flew to your rescue when clenched by the worst hag of them all." "They were disguised, if my memory serves me right; wore black crape over their faces." "Very true! very true! But let me tell you I am that man." "Give me your hand, my friend,: shaking it with great warmth.  "I owe you a life." "Aye! aye! a life you do owe me, and I want you to pay it; it is for that that I'm so glad to see you." "Iow do you mean?  What can I db for you, my friend?" "Draw near!   Let me get hold of your button! How can I talk to a man in the street, unless I have him by the button?" "Can't we have the gate unlocked? Where's the porter?"  "He's asleep, and there let him be. I  don't want any of his interruptions. I've got you by ,    122  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. the button, and here I want to keep you till I ' ve talked to some purpose." "Proceed, my friend," said Lord Ransler. "Well," said the lunatic, approaching, with his mouth close to the gate, "do you see that build- ing yonder?" , I do, and a fine one it is." "Well, that is Thorncliff's Private Lunatic Asy- lum, and within its walls is a soul that counts you its debtor!" ,c Creditor, you mean." "3No, debtor'! I mean just what I say!" "What soul is it? Some poor lunatic?" "Not a bit of it! That soul is no more a luna- tic than I, or rather you, for they say I am one." "You a lunatic? Who says that?'. "Everybody says it." "How comes that about?"        , "They say it because I'm a Millerite,: and I'm a Millerite because I want to be, even because I want- that doctrine to prove true. I want the Lord's second coming should be speedy! I long! yea, pant, for his coming! I want him to come and a second time preach deliverance! Oh, that the oppressed might go free! Oh, Lord! how long, how long, before oppression shall cease from under the sun?" and, stepping back from the gate, he began   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    123 to raise his voice louder and louder, and to gestic- ulate, saying: 'iTow long, oh, Lord! how long, before her majesty's subjects shall be allowed-to walk the green earth and breathe the pure air of heaven? Her majesty acknowledges no slavery in her do- minions! They have it south of us! They have it in Southern United States! I've seen it! I've lived there! I've seen and realized it in all its infernal windings! But oppression is not confined to the South! It exists at the North; society is weighed down with it; the very atmosphere is contaminated with oppression; every breeze comes laden with it, and go where you will, you can 't find a sniff of genuine free air. And it is no bet- ter in her majesty's possessions! There!- right. there, in that beautiful building, is oppression of the blackest dye! Yes," lowering his voice to just above a whisper, " those rooms are hideous with iniquitous oppression!" "I'll tell you what it is, I'm going to have a stop put to this oppression!" said Lord Ransler, in a soothing, patronizing tone. "You put a stop to it with your feeble arm? Never, your lordship, never! You and all the nobles in Christendom can not put a stop to op- pression! I No, my lord, none but God can do it.   124   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. No," he continued, his voice softening to its mild est tone, and his eye filling with tears, "no one can stop oppression but the meek and lowly and blessed Jesus!"And a sweet smile breaking through 'the tears lit up his whole countenance, and for a few moments he was in his right mind. "No," he persisted, "none can set this lost world right but Jesus. There is no goodness in the universe ex- cept where he has an influence." After a moment's pause, he added, "I'm rational now, and let me tell you, while I am so, that all I'm about to re- veal to you of what is transpiring in that attic chamber is true, and I entreat you to heed it." Then drawing near, and putting his hand through the gate for his lordship's button, his nostrils began to quiver and his eyes to glisten, as he asked: "Do you remember the ship Regal, and whom you saw in that box?" "I do, my friend." "Well, that same woman, even the Duchess of Groveland, is confined within those walls!" ", And not a lunatic?" "No more than you are, my lord! Yes, she 's there! and but two persons here know anything of it; namely, the diabolical old proprietor him- self, and your humble servant." "Did he let you into the secret?"   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   125 Not a bit of it! I found it out myself, and I'll tell you how. For several weeks-yes, for months-I heard footsteps over my room, which is in the highest story; heard the clank of a chain, groans and sobs, and sometimes I heard talking that sounded as if some one was pleading, and I knew there must be some one confined above me. Yet there was no visible stairs leading any higher than my room, nor could I see any window above mine. The porter and all the servants declared there was no room over mine, and I have no doubt that they attributed' my thinking so to my crazy imagination. I said nothing about it to Dr. Stran- ton, who, as your lordship is no doubt aware, is the proprietor of this establishment, but I noticed that the pleading I heard from time' to time was always when he was in the asylum. He only comestonce a day. This circumstance led me to watch him narrowly when he was about. I have the liberty of going just where I please so I do not leave the asylum grounds. I'm the only real luna- tic here at present, and am the only one who has the liberty of leaving his own room. I first ob- served that Dr. Stranton always went to the library and locked himself in, just before I heard this con- versation overhead, and I made up my mind that there must be some secret passage leading from   126I  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. the library to this upper room. I had heard of secret springs and trap-doors, and one day, after he was gone, a day on which there had been un- usually earnest talking on both sides in this same apartment above mine, I set myself to work in earnest to discover the secret entrance, which I was now satisfied must lead from the library. In peering about, among other places, I looked behind a large map hanging against the eastern wall; my eye was at once attracted, to something that looked like a large nail; on pressing my finger forcibly against it, a door opened into a small but well- lighted room, on the opposite side of which was another map; behind this I found another spring, and on touching it another door opened,. display- ing a very narrow pair of stairs; at the top of these stairs I found another map; the spring, however, behind this map was not so visible as the others; I found it though, and opened the door. There, in a low room, with no light but what came through a small sky-light, over which was fastened a latticed blind, I found a delicate and much emaciated female, chained so that she could n't walk as far as the door. Since that time I have visited her, on the sly, as often as I could, and have done all in my power, without raising suspicion, for her comfort. But, though a true   T'EE DXUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   127 Christian, she repines at her lot; she longs to see her children, and do something for them." "Ha! there comes some one down the steps. Is that the porter?" "That is even he, my lord, and our conversation must therefore cease; but on your life, my lord, divulge nothing that I have said to you." "Have no fears for that, my friend, but you must be very chary about knowing me, or any- thing about mei we must be utter strangers. I shall give my name as Jerome, from the United States." "You won't forget the oppressed one in the garret?" "No!" ,^^S,^^-   128  THE D UKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. CHAPTER VIII. HE porter now approached, and the lunatic walked off. "Is this Thorncliff's Private Lunatic Asylum?" It is," replied the porter, ulatocking the gate. "Is the doctor in?" "Not at present; he's at his residence, about three miles distant, and will not be here before m orning. Will you stop and spend the night?" "Have you accommodations for strangers?" "We are obliged to have, living here as we do, so far from any other habitation." "Well, then, as both myself and horse are pretty well tired out, and furthermore as I am anxious to see the doctor on business, perhaps it would be best for me to spend the night. My horse will be attended to, I suppose?" added Lord Ransler, now Mr. Jerome. "Yes, certainly; but the keeper of the grounds usually attends to such matters; we have so little of this kind of business that we have never kept any regular hostler, I 'll have it seen to."   THE DUIE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   129 'Can 't -I speak to the keeper myself?" said Lord Ransler, anxious to make as many acquaint- ances as possible. "As to that, you can suit yourself. Though perhaps it would be best for you to, come to think, for Jake 's been in high sulks all day, and might, refuse me if I should ask him. Milly!" he called, to an old colored servant, as he stepped into the hall, "Milly, do you know where the ground- keeper is?" "Who, Jake?" "Yes." "Oh, he's somewhar on de premises; I does n't know jist whar." "Well, I wish you 'd hunt him up, for this gen- tlejnan wants him to take care of his horse." 'Jake says he 's not gwine to take care of no mo' horses on dis yer place:" "Why, what 's up now, Milly?" "Enough 's up. Old Tho'ncliff made hm mad dis mornin', and he 's gwine to leave." "Well, Jake better be careful how he talks. I llave the keys to all the gates, and orders from Dr. Thorncliff not to let Jake leave till he says the word. It would n't take much to make the doctor lock him up for a lunatic."   130  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "We 'll all have our turn bein' locked up. I expects mine,'ll come sooner or later. And, Mr. Porter, I should n't wonder if your 'n come too some time. So you better be kind to poor Jake if you expects anybody to show mercy to you. For my part, I's ben oppressed, and knows how to pity others." "Well, never mind now, Milly, but hunt up Jdake, Hand tell him here's a gentleman from the United States to see the doctor on business." "Bein' from de United States do n't make him no better in my eyes. Has n't I lived in de United States? Has n't I ben a slave thar? Was n't I stold away from my lubly home in Africa and sold for a slave in de United States? Who cares for de United States? None of de people dar is any bet- ter dan dey ought to be!" "But you do n't want the poor horse to suffer, do you, Milly?" "Bress de good Lord, no! De poor horse can't help de sins of de people." And with that she rushed into the hall, looking rather crest-fallen when she found that the gentle- man had heard the whole conversation; but when she saw the large, bright piece of gold which he placed in her hand, she readily consented for him to accompany her in her search after Jake. And   TtIE DUIE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   131 when, as they were walking along, hei smilingly told her he was a strong Johnny Bull maan, she be- came quite reconciled to him, notwithstanding he' was from the United States. He made himself as agreeable as possible to Milly, not knowing how soon he might need her assistance in the under- taking before him. He might have taken care of his own horse, but for the thought that his purpose might be better forwarded by making the acquaint- ance of Jake. Milly, with whom  he was already on good terms, promised to use her influence toward making Jake his friend. They found Jake seated under a large tree, figur- ing in a ragged, much soiled little blank book. Ile was trying to make out his dues from  Dr. Thorn- cliff.  He arose as they approached, and touched his hat to the young lord, whom Milly, as pre- viously instructed by his lordship, introduced as Mr. Jerome, from the United States, who wanted to see him on business. After being assured by Mr. Jerome  that sho could serve him no longer, Milly withdrew to the house. "This is a  beautiful spot, my friend!" remarked Mr. Jerome, as soon as they found themselves alone. "It is all that, indeed!" said Jake. "It is far-famed for its beauty!" said Mr. Je-   132   THE DUIE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. rome. "I have long heard of it, and now, as I was passing near, and thinking of a friend's being placed here, I was directed to you, as the most suit- able person to guide me about and make all neces- sary explanations., "I ought to be! I 've been here long enough. Ever since the first stone -of that building was laid." "Ah! that must be a long time?" "Just six years ago this month! I was with the doctor when he selected the site. I superintended the planting of all these smaller trees myself." "You must feel attached to the place?" " To the grounds I do, but nothing further! There 's not a person on the place, except old Milly there, for whom I would turn over my hand!" "Ah, indeed! You surprise me! I thought you and Dr. Thorncliff were, very likely, bosom friends?" "Never, never, sir, never could there be a greater -mistake! I never could-bad as I anm-be a bosom conlpanion of such a man as Dr. Thorncliff. If I supposed you knew him, I should take such an in- sinuation as a great insult," and fixing his now flashing eyes on Mr. Jerome, he said, with so much emphasis that his voice was lost in a whisper, "t He is a fiend incarnate!" and as he spoke every muscle quivered with excitement. "I once served a mas- ter," he continued, "whom I honored, whom none   THE DUKE' S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   133 could helpbhonoring! But that is all over; I don't deserve his forgiveness." "Who was that noble master, if I may be so bold as to ask?" "It was no less a personage than the great and noble Duke of Groveland." "Is it possible? Under what capacity did you serve him?" "I was his horticulturist." "You made a great mistake in the exchalnge. But why not return to the duke?" "Returning to him would be certain death or im- prisonment. I was one of the scoundrelsengagedin carrying off the duchess, though perhaps you never heard of that circumstance, as you are from the United States." "Oh, yes; I 've heard of it. I knew all about it at the time. But what had the poor duchess done that you should assist to injure her so deeply?" "Oh, nothing, nothing! I had nothing against her or any one. I supposed at the time that I was doing, not only her, but the duke, a great favor." "Why, that 's singular, man! Why, what ever made you think it would be a favor to husband and wife to separate them? It can't be you believe in marriage at that rate?" "I believe in marriage, sir, fast enough; but I   134  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. was told that they were not lawfully married, but that the duke had married Lady Glenchester in right earnest, and he was anxious to get this woman out of the way; and that she-poor thing-was just as anxious to get away to save her from shame in the eyes of the world. I saw a note with the duke's name to it, in which he implored Dr. Stran- ton-that's his real name instead of Thorncliff-to get her out of the country with all the speed and secrecy possible, and to get the assistance of any servant he chose; and I felt honored when the doc- tor told me that I was his first choice. But, alas! I found, when it was too late, how terribly I was duped!" "You were duped, indeed, my friend; as badly as Eve was, and by the same majesty, only in a differ- ent form. Cheer up, man; I can put you in the way to recover the duke's favor again." "How? I would almost sacrifice my eyes to stand where I once did in his grace's esteem." "Follow my advice, and you will stand higher than ever in his favor." "Name the act; and, if within the range of possi- bilities, it shall be done. No matter what difficulties lie in the way, they shall be encountered. I feel that life-long toil and labor would be none too   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   135 much to set right the mischief I have helped to do. Please to name the sacrifice." ".Find this same duchess, and restore her to the duke, and I can warrant you the past shall all be wiped out." He shook his head sorrowfully, saying, "I'd will- ingly undertake the task, did I know where to find her, and she was willing to return; but you know she has another husband, and though she married him much against her will, for the sake of her chil- dren, she may now be equally unwilling to leave him. However, if any one will tell me where to find her, I'll make bold to try." "The task will not be. so hard as you imagine. In the first place, she is not living with the villain whom she was forced to marry. He has forsaken her, and she is now confined within those walls!" "Within those walls.! You are much mistaken! I know every apartment, and I know positively that not one of them has a female occupant!" "Do you know of an attic room?" "I did know of such a room, but the passage to it was walled up two years ago, so that, of course, it can not be occupied." "Is there no secret passage?" "I think not. I do r't see how there can be." "Well, my friend, if I have not been wrongly   136   THE DUK'ES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. informed, there is one, and if you 'll lead me cau- tiously to the library, it has been so well described to me that I think I can show it to you." "Let's go! If she really is there, I 'll risk my life but she shall be set at liberty!" "But we must be cautious. Suppose we repair to the stable and feed my horse first, and as we go I 'll describe the secret entrance." "All right." And they set out at a brisk pace. "But stop!" said Mr. Jerome. This ll never do. For us to go to the stable; and then to the library together, will excite suspicion at once." "That's a fact; I did n't think of that. Well, I 'll take the horse alone, and you go to the li- brary." "But that 's not enough. I'm afraid they already suspicion us. We must appear to be enemies. You must denounce me as a trouble- some, good-for-nothing rascal of a Yankee, and I must be down on you for not being willing to take care of my horse; must call you a lazy, crabbed cur, and declare I 'll report you to headquarters. And if we chance to meet in the presence of others, we must look thunder and lightning at each other. Of course such avowed enemies will never think of meeting to lay plans. If I find the secret pas- sage and the duchess, I 'll signal to you from the   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    137 library window. At all events I 'll slip out at dusk, and if possible we 'll have another turn through the grounds, to fix on some plan of pro- cedure." "Good," said Jake; and he led the horse to the stable. Mr. Jerome, after saying all the bitter things he could think of against Jake to the porter, asked that worthy to let him go to the library to read and cool off his wrath. 4Ii   E DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. R. JEROME was in a dilemma, a good deal ,Ad disconcerted; for that hound of a porter had not, as he requested, shown him to the library, but left him in the sitting room, after having assured him that Dr. Thorncliff had only that morning given positive orders that no one be allowed to visit the library during his absence. What was to be done? Without access to the library, he could not reach the duchess, and unless she was rescued to-night it might be forever too late. And, more than all that, why had visitors been forbidden to the library all of a sudden, un- less it was that they feared her pitiful cries, while they carried their nefarious designs into operation, might be overheard? He took out an old letter, the identical one con-. fided to Stella five or six months before, by the mysterious man in the oak-openings. "Yes," he said, as he glanced over it, "this is the night. She may even' now be struggling in the   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   139   hands of her murderers. May God have mercy upon her!" And he began rapidly to pace the floor, laying his hand from time to time on his revolvers. Once. he stopped and took them out, and as he did so a small parcel slipped from his side-pocket and rolled along at his feet. It was a bottle of laudanum which he had that morning purchased for the pur- pose of bathing a bruise on his horse. It was still unopened. He held it up to the light, and as he gazed at it a new thought seemed to strike him. With a half laugh, he set his teeth, drew back the corners of his mouth, scowled, shook his head, and looked as much as to say: " Oh, if I only had some of this down the neck of that villainous porter, the library might be reached and the whole thing accomplished without bloodshed !" "Down the neck of the porter!" he repeated. " Sure enough; but how in the name of all good- ness is such a feat to be accomplished?" He put up his revolvers, replaced the vial in his pocket, threw himself into an easy chair, and be-. gan to reflect on all the chances, probable and pos. sible, of yet reaching and rescuing the duchess. But the chances seemed to be against him, for that expression of lofty self-reliance so peculiar to   "O   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL .ESCAPE. him gradually faded into a look of utter depend- ence, and his whole soul appeared to cry out: "Whlere can help be found? Who can aid me in this great need?" "God!" whispered an invisible speaker. He buried his face in -his hands, and began a prayer, which was interrupted, however, by his at- tention being attracted to a stealthy footstep in the room. It was the lunatic! With an eager movement he was about to rush forward and exclaim, "My good friend, lead me directly to the library!" but the lunatic laid his finger on his lip in token of silence, and made signs that he wished to be followed. They made their exit through a little side-door, and after passing silently along under window after window, they paused before one where a can- dle was already lit. It was the dining-room. At a little round table, where a dinner was spread for one, stood the porter, holding in either hand a bottle of wine, which he was carefully examining by the lighmt. One of these bottles he placed on the sideboard, in the other he deposited a white powder and set it on the table. "Who drinks that wine is a dead man!" whis- pered-almost shrieked-the lunatic, his eyes fairly   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL. ESCAPE.   '141 green with excitement, and in a minute more dis- appearled. Finding himself alone, Mr. Jerome returned to the parlor, where he was scarcely seated when the porter entered, all bows and smiles, and asked him out to dine. "Will you not partake of our wine?" asked the porter, with a faintly perceptible uneasiness in his tone, as Mr. Jerome rose from the table without touching the wine. "Thank you, friend," said the latter; "I seldom take wine after so late a dinner. It invariably gives me a headache." "Not the pure juice of the grape, man! No wonder your wines in the United States give you a headache, for they say that they are often nothing but raw whisky, drugged and put into a cask with a foreign brand, and then sold for genuine imported wine. No wonder, indeed, that they give you the headache. But ours is the pure juice of the grape, very old and choice, and never yet gave any man the headache. Can you not waive objections for once? The doctor prides himself on his wines, and would consider his house want- ing in hospitality if a guest-and particularly from the United States--should depart without having drank them."   "2  THE DVUIE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Are you quite sure that your wine is not drugged?" said Mr. Jerome, fixing a withering stare on the porter, who, without wincing, affirmed them to be the pure juice of the grape, in proof of which he hoped his good friend would taste for himself, and added, laughingly, 4 You must look out how you call in question the purity of the doctor's wines; he 'll call you out." "I do n't know but I will waive objections for once, come to think of it, since you are so impor. tunate," said Mr. Jerome, turning suddenly to the table, a new and strange light gleaming in his eye, and, in reaching for the bottle, he managed to top over the candle with so much adroitness that it was immediately extinguished. The porter instantly possessed himself of a match, but before he could get hold of the candle it had managed to dip its head into some liquid and became so wet that he found it impossible to relight it, and called loudly for Milly to come and get another candle. She not hearing, however, he was obliged to go himself. As soon as he was well out of the room, Mr. Je- rome seized the wine bottle on the table, and, with- the agility of a cat, flew to the open window and poured at least two-thirds of its contents out on the ground, then caught the bottle on the side-   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    143 board, poured a small quantity of the wine into his glass, refilled the bottle with laudanum, placed it again on the sideboard, and, taking his seat, awaited the return of the porter, who, when he did come, looked as much as to say, "Now I could be merry!" when he saw the partially empty bottle. Mr. Jerome, too, looked gratified. "You see I have not been idle. There is one road I can travel without a light, especially if wine be my company. And this wine is so very fine. There is just enough left for you to drink my health." "Thank you!" said the porter, and, without seeming to notice the wine on the table, took the bottle, from the sideboard, and, filling a half-pint goblet, said to Mr. Jerome, "Your health, sir, and long life!" then drank it without stopping. "Oh, but you got the start of me!" said Mr. Jerome. "Fill another goblet now, and let us drink together." He did so, and this time they tipped glasses, the porter repeating what he did before, and Mr. Je- rome saying, "Your health, sir, and a good, long night's sleep!"  Just as they set down their glasses, footfalls were heard in the adjoining entry, as of some one trying in vain to step lightly. The porter listened a mo- ment, and quietly left the room.   "4  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. Mr. Jerome returned to the sitting-room, where he was soon after joined by the porter, who, with- out saying anything of any adventure he had met with during his absence, complained of drowsiness, which he declared to be a very unusual thing with him. H e was sure it must be the weather! Mr. Jerome remarked that the atmosphere was very sultry; he thought that the rain could hardly be over. With keys in hand, the porter threw himself on the sofa, as if to rest a moment before going to perform some important duty. But the room soon resounded with his heavy breathing; he was sound asleep! Mr. Jerome knew ii was the laudanum, and that his sleep would be long, if, indeed, he ever awoke. With this last thought there came some twinges of conscience, but he consoled himself with thinking that he was only sacrificing the guilty for the innocent, and was just possessing himself of the keys, when a loud shriek broke upon his ear. He thought of the duchess, and with revolver in hand rushed into the hall, where he was confi'onted by Milly, who, with uplifted hands and rolling eyes, declared that she had been- chased by a ghost! "Wlhee?" said Mr. Jerome, suppressing a smile, and trying to look alarmed. "Lead me to the   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE:    145 spot! I'll shoot any ghost that dares to molest you!" he continued, drawing Milly's arm through his, who, old, black, and frightened as she was, could but feel a throb of pleasure at this stretch of gallantry, and immediately began to lead the way to the wine cellar. "I's never no hand to b'l'eve in ghosts," she said, as they proceeded; "dey mostly turns out to be humans o' some sort, but dis yer one must a bil one sure! Fust thing I sawd was a coffin't come rollin' and tumblin' down from somewhar, and den come de ghost, a sailin' right down from de cham- berfloor, a hangin' on to nothin', and its heels a danlglin' in de air! And. it called, 'Milly! Milly!' when I' begun to run, and said somethin' about Jake! But I tells you I did n't stop to see what it had to say, or whar it lit! Dar's de bery coffin now!" she exclaimed, as they entered the wine cellar, and stopped before a real wood coffin, about large enough for a small woman, or a boy of four- teen or fifteen years of age. Again Mr. Jerome thouight of the duchess. "Bress my soul! what's all dis yer?" said Milly, as, a few feet farther on, they encountered a newly- erected stone wall, surrounding an area of ten or twelve- feet square, and rising to an altitude of fif- teen or sixteen feet. "Dis yer's new! Dis yer's been   "6   AHE DUKEI  WONDERFUL ESCAPE. built to-day!" she continued, examining the damp -mortar with which the stones were cemented to- gether. c Only last night I seed an old wooden box standin' here, and when I axed Dr. Tho'ncliff what i 'twas for, he said 'twas to cover an old well under da', and see! dar's mo' mortar, and stones, and a trowel! De wall ain't done yet!" During the latter part of this harangue Mr. Jerome was a little absent, havinu observed a pair of mascu- line hands clenched tightly over the top of the wall. ,Right up dar's whar I seed him! But bress me what--what's all dis yer? I can see de bery heavens! Has de good Lord really come? Is dis: yer whar we's all gwiue up?" "It's where one of us just now came down!" called out Jaike, unable longer to keep quiet. "Dat ar's Jake's voice! Jake! whar's you, Jake?" , Here, on my way to the bottomless pit for what I know! I m sure of it unless I get help soon!"I Quick as thought Mr. Jerome seized a step-ladder that stood near, climbed up, and, reaching over, pulled Jake out by main strength. "Why, what does all this moan, friend? I thought you went to take care of my horse?" said he, slapping Jake jo- cosely on the shoulders. "So I did, to the best of my ability; and when I   THE DUKE'S TWONDERFUL ESCAPE.   147 went to the library, according to agreement, instead of finding you, sir, I found a horrid trap, that sent me well nigh to destruction!" "But I thought the agreement was that you were to come at the signal." "So it was, and I started the moment I spied it; almost crept on my hands and knees for fear of being heard, and did n't think I made noise enough for any mortal ears to hear me. But that fiend of a porter has ears like a cat, or the evil one himself, for I had but just stepped into the library and be- gun to look around for you, when he 'hemmed!' tauntingly, and shut the door and locked it. I was so stunned at such a turn of aftairs that I stood stock still, as if nailed to the spot; and while look- ing straight before ine, thinking it was all a plan wrade up between you and him, I heard some one whisper: "' Touch the large nail behind the map.' "I was sure it was you, and began to search around in every nook and corner where I thought you could be, when I heard the same whisper: "'Touch the large nail behind the map.? "This time I knew it -Las that crazy Clenches- ter, and on looking behind the map, sure enough, there was an unusually large nail, which I not only touched, but pressed my finger against it with full   "8  TH& D UKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. force, rising on tiptoe for it, when, to my infinite surprise, away went the wall, and I saw before me at a little distance a coil of rope, and near it a new empty coffin. One end of the rope seemed to be fastened to something above the ceiling, and as I took hold of it and was moving it from side to side, to see how it was fixed, lo and behold! I sud- denly found myself sailing down to where you found me; and if it had n't been for Milly's light showing me the wall, there 's no knowing where I should have landed." "Bress de Lord! I's been o' some use in dis yer world! I's done some good; I's been de means o' savin' yer life, Jake," said Milly, clapping her hands. "No thanks to you, though," said Jalke scorn- fully. "You,need n't profess to be my friend any more, for when I called you in my distress, you ran from me as much as if I 'd a been a ghost." "Dat's it! dat's it! I did think you was a ghost for sure. Who s'pected to see you come sailin' right down from de chamber floor a hangin' on to nothin', and yer heels a danglin' in .de air? I did think you was a ghost, sure enough, or I never 'd a run, for I's yer friend, Jake. I's always a friend to de friendless, and de good Lord knows   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    149 you 's friendless enough, poor Jake," said Milly, wiping her eyes. "I should a thought you 'd a known my voice," said Jake, sullenly. "When folks are frightened, the senses of sight and sound are apt to be confused," said Mr. Jerome, coming to Milly's rescue when he saw her confu- sion.  "But the signal, friend; I thought we agreed upon a signal?" "So we did; and I tell you that I started as soon as I saw it," protested Jake. 4 But I placed no signal there, for-" "You certainly did, for I never saw anything plainer in my life." "You are mistaken friend, for-" '"I know I.'m not," declared Jake, in a high key and face like scarlet. "Well, then, if you will insist that I placed one there, oblige me by describing it." It was a white cloth, and I could show it to you this minute if I could only get into the li- brary.' "ead the way, then, to the library, and show it to me." "I can 't, for the door is locked, and the porter has the key."   150  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "The porter is asleep, and I have the key,-' said Mr. Jerome triumphantly, handing it to hillm. With a look 'of pleased surprise and inquiry, Jake took the key and set out. "There," said he, throwing open the library door, " there is the identical, white cloth that I saw fluttering from the window." "I did not place it there though, for the very good reason that I never was in the library before, nor could I get permission to come," said Mr. Jerome. "Dat?- Why dat ar's a white window-curtain that blowed out in de time of the storm, and beeri flappin' in de breeze eber since," said Milly. "Sure enough!" said Jake, " that is the white curtain! I never was more deceived in my life!" "Mystery upon mystery!" exclaimed Mr. Jerome, looking upward through the roof at the heavens, and then trying to peer down that part of the passage-way already partially explored by Jake. Feeling, how- ever, that there was-no time to be lost, he moved forward to the next map, touched the spring, and saw open before them another room with the nar- row flight of stairs, as described by the lunatic. Up these steps he ran, Jake and Milly follow- ing in mute surprise and consternation. :As he   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   151 neared the top he stopped, motioning those be- hind to do the same. A faint, sweet voice was chanting that beautiful hymn, commencing with 'Jesus, I my cross have taken, All to leave and follow Thee!" "Amen! amen! amen!" shouted a loud voice from the foot of the stairs, as the last stanza was completed. It was the lunatic! and, springing up the stairs before them, he touched the sprintg and walked into the room. "Great God!" he instantly shouted, raising his eyes and hands toward heaven, " how  long shall her majesty's subjects-nay, Thine own subjects, Thine own little ones-be deprived of Thy free broadcast blessings?  Oh, Lord! how long! how long! how long!" And thus-he continued, shouting at the very top of his voice, beating his head and foaming, paying no heed whatever to the gentle being before him, who, with outstretched hand and beaming, tearful face, was trying to call his attention to the Savior, which name she well knew was the only one under heaven that could transform him from the roaing lion to the gentle lamb. But he saw her not.   152   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. Mr. Jerome, who had followed him into the room, a privilege he had not granted to Milly or Jake for fear of annoying the duchess, fearing that she might recognize him, for he observed that whenever she turned her eyes on him she immedi- ately assumed the look of one trying to recall something, and wishing still to preserve his incog- nito, and 'being withal quite out of patience with the lunatic, stepped out to Jake, who was explain- ing to Milly as best he could, the true state of affairs, and said: "This must not endure; that fellow will rouse the whole house; and if we expect to escape with our lives, and, above all, with the duchess, we must be active! Is there a carriage about the premises? I see she is altogether too delicate to walk any distance." "There is," said Jake, hesitatingly, "but it is for two horses, and there is but one horse about the premises, except yours!"  "Put mine in then, by all means; and, friend," he contiinued, impressively, "be as expeditious as possible, for I have positive means of knowing that Dr. Thorncliff may himself be here at -any min- ute!"' "Enough said! I'll have things ready in   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    153 twenty minutes!" said Jake, turning upon his heel. "And now, Milly," said he, "what can you do for us?" "De good Lord know I's ready to do all I can for de oppressed!" "Well, then, have you any decent clothes you can put on her?" "I has dat! I's got a- full suit of de Quaker costume, dat I wore when I trabled on de under- ground railroad! I's always kept 'em! I didn't know what for, unless it was to remember de day ob my delibery, but now, bress de Lord, I knows it is for dis yer bery 'casion!" "The Quaker costume will be just the thing; and now, my friend, get her ready as soon as possible, and you shall be well rewarded." "Trust dis yer child for dat!" said she, and pro- ceeded about her task. Mr. Jerome   made a tour to the sitting-room and other parts of the house to see if all was quiet, and then returned to wait in the library. "You's been a great sufferer!" said Milly, sigh. ing, as she combed the long, once raven, now ,snowy  tresses straight back and fastened them in a  knot behind. "You's too young for dese white locks!"   154  THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Yes, I used to suffer,' said the duchess, at length, after some reflection, "but 1'm happy now! Those white locks came from repining at my lot. Since I have found that my Father was here with me, I have been more contented, and sorrow and unhappiness have fled away!" ' Your father shut up here in dis yer room?' "No, not shut up! My Father is too great to be shut up anywhere! The heavens can not con- tain Him, let alone this little room!" "Who is your father?" asked Milly, looking askance at her, and beginning to think that per- haps she was crazy after all. "My Father is a king!   The King of kings, the Lord of lords!" And seeing that her old black auditor did not ^ seem to quite understand her, she asked: "Do you know who God is?" "Bress Him, I ought to, when He 's been my Friend and Deliberer for dese many years!" "Well, He 's my father! I'm His daughter, and every day He graces this room with His presence! With such companly, what can I ask for more?" 'Dat's dle way every true chile o' God ought to talk! But how many and many has dis yer chile knowed dat perfessed to be His, and did n't know nor care if He was near dem or no!" replied Milly,               s.    HE DUI ES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   155 now no longer doubtful as to the sanity of the duchess, and silently, almost reverently, she drew the plain clean cap over the white hair; then fol- lowed the good old-fashioned Quaker bonnet, and after it the shawl. As they stood on the threshold, ready to go down into the library, the duchess suddenly turned back, exclaiming: "Oh, this is a good place! How can I leave it? Here's where I first found my dear Savior, and here, from day to day, He has supped with me and I with Him!" and she threw herself on her knees by the little old chair where she had been accus- tomed to commune with Him. "Ite 'll go  with you!" said Milly, the tears streaming down her kind black face, in view of this touching incident. "Bress Iim! He's always been with me, when I was in boudage and eber since I came out!" "Lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of- the world!" murmured the lunatic, who was seated half-way down the stairs. On reaching the library, the duchess was so com- pletely exhausted that Mr. Jerome was obliged to carry her the rest of the way in his arms. "Is the carriage all ready?" asked Mr. Jerome   156  THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. of Jake, whom they met, all out of breath, at the front door. "Yes, but Thorncliff, with somebody else, is at the gate!" "Well, let us hurry out at some other gate. There are othergates, are there not?" "Oh, there 's gates enough, for that matter, but the carriage-house is so near this gate that it will be impossible to get the carriage out without be- ing heard by them " "Ah?" said Mr. Jerome, with some little alarm in his tone, and seeking out the most sheltered and retired spot he could find in the grounds, he left the duchess there for a few mintues, in the care of Jake and Milly, while he went to recon- noiter. ' .        * " \/'    THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   157 CHAPTER X. i Y   not go in immediately, doctor? Why , sr Wait?" said one of two, who sat on their horses near the front* gate, as Mr. Jerome ap- proached it. "We can't till the porter opens the gate, which he will not do till twelve o'clock, if he follows my orders. We could n't proceed to business be- fore that time, any way, for Forsith might come at the last minute." "Forsith! who's he? That's a new name!" "He that she married soon after we came over. I thought you were knowing to the circumstance." "I did n't. know Forsith, at all. I thought I ,knew all the company, too. Stanworth, I thought, was the most likely one to want her. But I did n't think it possible that she could ever be brought to take such a step! It's just like the fickleness of women, however." "Not like her! She was as true as steel to the duke! She stood out to the last minute, and only married when she did to save the lives of her children! But Stanworth is the man! He   158   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. changedhis name to Forsith, and now, since he's married agairi, he goes by the name of Mack!" "Oh, ho! that's it, is it? But how came she here? Is she really crazy?" "Crazy, no! No more than- you or I, nor could she be made so. She's sensitive to the last degree, and is often subjectto the mostintense mental excite- ment, but reason never totters. That woman has endured more torture of mind than any person I ever knew, and yet she seems to thrive under it. Not physically. In that respect she is but a mere wreck of her former self-thin and wrinkled, her eyes sunk way in her head, and her hair is per- fectly white 1 She looks almost as old again as she really is 1" e' She always did look rather old for the duke, ac- cording to my way of thinking. I've always won- dered what infatuation ever led the duke to marry her. That he should prefer her before the beauti- ful, gifted, and titled Lady Glenchester, to whom he was affianced in infancy, as I understand, and that everybody was in favor of his marrying, is more than I can fathom!" "Well, the fact is, the duke always was one of those stiange, stubborn, mulish fellows, that always will think for themselves! Because his father- away back when he was, a wee imp-agreed with her   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   159 father that he, Lord Winton, prospective Duke of Groveland, should marry Lady Glenchester-then in her cradle-when they both came to maturity, was n't going to make any difference with him. He was bound to marry for love, if there was any such thing. If he loved Lady qlenchester, and was sat- isfied that she loved him, he'd marry her; otherwise he'd look elsewhere, let the consequences be what they would. And, bad as I hate him, I do n't blame him for that."  "All that may be, and I agree with him, out and out, in wanting to make his own selection; but still I can't account for his fancy." "I can; it was the dawning of her royal mind that attracted him, though I do n't suppose he knew what it was himself!" "Royal mind! I hope you do n't pretend to say that she has a royal mind? Why, I've always re- garded her as being exceedingly commonplace, and not at all brilliant!" "Whether she is brilliant or not depends on what you mean by brilliant. She's not brilliant like the sparkling, noisy, babbling, but at the same time shallow brook; she's the clear, deep, and si- lent river, and every trial has ieemed to have the effect of a tributary in increasing its depth, width, and grandeur!"   160  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "And-to carry out the figure-you intend that, this famous river shall reach its mouth to-night, I suppose?" "Yes; I'm sorry to say that such is the melan- choly fact. This beautiful, this magnificent river flows into the ocean of eternity to-night!" "Why, man, you speak gloomily about it! Do you regret it?" "I do, indeed; and as the hour approaches, my heart almost fails me.; without two or three extra glasses of wine I can never go through with it. Of all the evil deeds I ever committed, I hate this the worst!" "Better leave that last rite to me, and let your wine go. I can use the dagger at any time with- out a compunction." "Not on her, if you knew her as well as I do!" "'Yes I could. There is nt a being in the uni- verse-not even its Author-that I couldn't pon- iard with a good heart, if such a course suited my  convenience!" I guess you'd feel some little twinges of con- science afterward, when their images haunted you." "Not a bit of it! I never felt a twinge of con- science in my life. People talk about conscience, but, for my part, I never had any!" "The truth is, you were born a devil!"   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   161 "That's a fact, and my brother here was born a philosopher. But it's strange to me that a philoso- pher should 'ever turn out to be so great a villain!" "I'm not a villain; I deny the charge! That I've done terrible things, I do n't pretend to deny. But, remember, I have been terribly provoked; and, more' than all that, I was not 'at the bottom of all this mischief. I have, to a great extent, been the tool of others. I was not the chief instigator of all this mischief by any means." "Wh o then was? Not Lord Glenchester?" "No, not his lordship; but it was his beautiful, gifted, titled, and charming daughter, of whom you are so much enamored! And her father laughs and chuckles over it, to think she is so deep!" "What! Not Lady Glenchester?" "Yes, even Lady Glenchester." "Well! well! I 've often heard it said that there never was any evil in the world but a. woman was at the bottom of it, and I believe it; though, I' must say, she's the last person I should ever have dreamed of being guilty of instigating such an enormity." " She's not the last person I should have dreamed of, for I never liked her. I could poniard her with. a good heart!" "Tut! tut! do n't say that, doctor, after having   1.62  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. made her cause your own to the extent that you have.' "I've never made her cause mine. Her plan was matured and made known to me just about the same time that the great injuries done me by George Winton came to light, and I naturally seized hold of it as the sweetest vengeance I could take. But, though I have gone with' her in her deviltry, I despise her from my inmost soul!"  "Well, I am utterly amazed that Lady Glenches- ter, with her antecedents, should be guilty of not only countenancing, but of instigating such crimes!" "I've no objections to her antecedents. They are all well enough; but herself I have ever regarded as a regular viper. ,Sh is shrined in a beautiful golden cage, bedecked with gems, I grant you; but for all that she is a viper still!" "But what could be her object in setting on foot all this mischief?" "Why, what could it be but to get the duke? I do n't think she cares two cents for him, as far as that is concerned; but she loves his estates and titles. They would be a great catch; and she thought if the duchess and her children were out of the way she was sure of them, for you know the duke has always paid her a great deal more attention in pub- lie than he ever has to the duchess. He's never   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   1@ paid the poor duchess any marked attention to speak of for that matter, for fear of raising suspicions; for you know he wanted to keep his marriage a pro- found secret; and it was kept from his father. The old duke died in ignorance of it; and to the last minute supposed that Lady Glenchester was to be the next duchess of Groveland. If he had known of the marriage, George Winton would never have been duke." "Would he have been disinherited?" "To be sure he would." "Then Lady Glenchester would much better have consulted with the old duke on the subject of his son's marriage, and had it set aside." "Ah! she had too much of the wisdom of the old serpent for that! She knew too well that the old Scotchmnan would never agree to a divorce except on ible principles, but would at once have disinherited this son and made another one his heir to the duke- dom. She knew that if she let the old duke into the secret all was lost. Her only hope was in get- ting the duchess and her children out of the way-- have it reported that she, the duchess, had eloped with a young English captain, and thus to disgust the duke, and then try to win him over to herself. She had no idea of both parties holding out as they have done. She begins to think the duke is a hope-   164  ITHE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. less case, and wants to get out of it the best way she can. Is willing I should slaughter the duchess, her children, and anybody else who may in any way interfere with the whole thing's being kept a pro- found secret." "Then you think she can't succeed in getting the duke?" "I do n't think he'll ever marry again. He's not so much of a marrying man as that. Although a great ladies' man, the duchess was probably the only woman he ever really loved or ever will. By killing her I oblige him to live a solitary life, which is some satisfaction at least, even if I never get hold of him!" "There it is again! That the duke should love her, and can't by any possible means be brought to love another, is beyond me! Why, I've always thought she hardly had common sense! I remem- ber of once seeing her at a party, after they were married-I did n't know it though, and I do n't think any one there did-and while his grace was the life and soul of the company, she sat apart from the rest and had nothing to say, her hands folded, and she seemed to take no interest whatever in what was going on around her. Seeing her thus alone as it were, I took a seat beside her and tried to draw her into conversation; but it was of no use. She   THE DU UE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   165 smirked and twisted and simpered, and tried to say something, but it amounted to nothing more than yes or no, or else something that had nothing to do with the subject. I concluded she was a consummate fool and walked away in disgust." "Her not being able to converse at a party is nothing against her. Some of the greatest minds and most profound thinkers have been noted for not being able to talk small talk; and you know that's about all that's ever done at parties. Those who shine at parties are generally such as skim along on the surface of thought and never go to any great depth. They can often seize hold of the thoughts of others and handle them with a good deal of agility, but are not good at originating anything of any weight themselves. The duchess is very original, and generally engaged with her own thoughts." "His grace, the duke, has a very fine mind." That's a fact! Bad as I hate him I'll do him the justice to admit that he's bright; that he has a great mind in short. He 's really one of the greatest men of the age. His mind is peculiarly elastic. He can dive to the profoundest depths of thought, remain there any length of time, and then, at a moment's warning, rise instantly as it were, and skim along the surface with the swiftness and lightness of a bird. Damn him! ie's great; but I hate him, and vengeance is sweet!"   166   THE DUKES WONDERFTLl ESCAPE. ("But what satisfaction is there in all this re- venge, if the duke do n't know it?" "He does know in part, and I intend he shall yet know all, after his family are consigned to the catacomb. There is one thing I wish to speak of, however, now the subject of minds is up. I never mentioned it to any one before. It is this : With all my observation, and experience too, I have come to the settled conclusion that there is no perfect human mind; by which I mean that there is no one indi- vidual who possesses in a satisfactory degree every faculty, or perhaps trait, desirable and even neces- sary to form a complete mind. And in seeking partners for life, men, and women- too. are attracted -without-knowing it themselves-by those minds in the opposite sex which, put with their own, wrill make a perfect whole, and if true to themselves will marry. I do not mean to say that if one of these minds is poor the other must ,be good, or if one is good the other must be poor, for both may be good. But I do mean to say that where one of the parties fails, the other must make up. Such unions, and such only, are invariably happy. Such a union was that of the duke and duchess. That it was a true love match has been abundantly proven by the conduct of both parties since they have been separated."   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    167 "So you mean to spite the duke by killing his other half?  "I do n't think ' other half' expresses it. People talk about their other half, and their better half, but I do n't so understand it. I want to take re- venge on the duke by consigning to destruction that which, dovetailed into his own mind, makes it a perfect whole, whether a half, a hundredth, or two-thirds, or whatever you have a mind to call it i" "Well, I must confess I do n't quite understand you, and do n't suppose I can if I try. The truth is, I'm rather obtuse in such matters. But, to change the subject, it seems you have a catacomb; that I can understand." :To be sure I have a catacomb. What could have become of all the poor devils sent here from time to time, if I had no catacomb for them?" , Cured and discharged, I suppose." "Not at all, not at all, sir. They were sent here for a very different purpose; they were sent here to be got rid of. Oh, a few of course have been sent, through the ignorance of their friends, to be cured, and have been treated accordingly; but the majority were sent for quite another purpose, and have found rest in the catacomb. And, hark ye!   168   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. I have a place there for his grace, the Duke of Groveland; and if my agents are successful, he'll be in the enjoyment of it before a year!" "What do you do to them all to get them ready for- the catacomb? Do you resort to violence?" "Oh, no! that's seldom necessary. I 'rh too chicken-hearted for that, when I can get along without it." "How do you manage?" "Oh, a- little white powder, in small quantities at first, mixed with their wine, or coffee, or tea, or perhaps with their bread or meat, makes and keeps them a little delicate. After a while they take to. their beds, and finally a little larger dose takes them off entirely. They are allowed to correspond with their friends--interested ones, you under- stand. They first write tha tthey are failing very fast, and at last I write that they are no more; that the last sad rite has been performed, and that they rest in the potter's-field." "But I should think there would be danger of their friends coming on to visit them, or at least to demand their bodies for burial elsewhere.') "Ah ha! we look out for that. The postmark is always so dim'that it is impossible to decipher it, and the real name is never mentioned inside of   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    169 the letter; so that, though some of their friends know of their sickness and death, none but the particularly interested ones know in what part of the globe it occurred." "Is it generally known that you have a cata- comb?" "It is known to no living soul except the por- ter and myself. Others did know, but they have since found a home in it. And, to tell the truth, I expect the porter will sleep there one of these days. You see, I go upon the principle that dead men tell no tales! After serving me a little longer I shall put him there. I don't know but he's there now, lihe's so long irn getting out here. It certainly must be twelve o'clock." "Oh, it must be past twelve long ago! What did you say was your reason for wanting to wait till twelve o'clock? I did-n't quite understand you when you told me." "Why to wait for Forsith." "Oh, ho! But what's the use of waiting for him?" "Why, he might object to the whole proceeding. I wrote to him some six or eight months ago, and told him what we proposed to do in case he did not object, and that if he did n't come or write- in short, if we did n't hear from him by twelve   170   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. o'clock to-night-we should conclude that he was of our opinion, and should proceed to carry -our plan into execution. If he does come, I shall leave no stone unturned to get him into the cata- comb. He is the most dangerous one leftof all the company. The fact is, I 've felt as though in a straight-jacket ever since the duchess has been here, just on his account. And yet it has been quite impossible to get hold of him." ' Why in the world did n't he keep her when he had her? What did he place her here for if she was n't crazy?" "Why, he did n't want her. Is n't that a good reason?" "But why did n't he want her now as well as at first? Did he comne to the same conclusion that I did?" "He came to the conclusion that she did n't love him, and never would; and what man wants a wife that do n't? The truth is, he found that he could never win her thoughts from the duke ; in short, that her whole soul was, and apparently ever would be, centered in his grace. And having at last, as he thought, found the other part of himself, he concluded to get rid of this woman and marry her. Accordingly, he came to me to take her off   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    171 his hands. I at once told him to bring her here, as though she was a lunatic, and let all the yearly fund from Lady Glenchester come to me, and I would send him so much for the support of the children. lIe jumped at the chance, and now he is married again. I have no doubt but that the whole family live on the little that I send for the support of the two girls, for he always was a lazy dog." "Then it seems that the girls are not yet in the catacomb?"  "Oh, no! they 're alive yet, or were last fall, and poor, ragged, starved things they are. Oh, would n't it grind his grace's pride to the very earth to know the condition of his wife and chil- dren! Oh, it does me good to humble the Winton blood; I gloat over it! I saw them by accident last fall. While riding through those miserable oak-openings in Western New York, not a hundred miles from Lake Island-and, by the way, Lake Island belongs to his grace, though I do n't sup- pose he knows it himself-I came spat upon them. It was by one of them that I sent that letter to Forsith." "Why, brother mine, you did n't go and intrust so dangerous a letter to two children, and girls at that?"   fi            .   172  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. 'Yes, but I did though, and I do n't think it was running any risk. I would much rather trust to them, all things considered, than to the public mail. I 'll engage you that letter was lodged'safely in the hands of Forsith before an hour, or as soon as he got home, as I believe he was away at the time; and, as he does not appear, I take it for granted that he is of our opinion. I told you the girls were alive. But I don't know as they are now; they are not if he took my advice. I found by talking with them that they were altogether too bright, and knew altogether too much, for our purpose, and told him so in the letter, and that the whole thing might yet leak out through them." "There 's the porter now. I heard footsteps." "It's not the porter; he comes in a very differ- ent style from that. It's that crazy fellow; he's out skulking about at all times of night, though I told the porter to have him locked up to-night." "Is he a candidate for the catacomb?" "Oh, no! He's really crazy; a sort of monoma- niac on the subject of religion and oppression. A regular hot-headed, religious fool, and particularly troublesome here. No, he's not intended for the catacomb; but I'd a had him long ago if it had n't been for Lord Glenchester. He's his natural brother, you know, and his lordship is very fond   THE DUKES  WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   173 of him, though he's made of very different stuff from himself." "It's a little singular that they should be so much attached to each other when they are so dif- ferent." "I do n't know as it is; opposites are very apt to be attractive to each other." "But why does his lordship send him here, if he thinks so much of him?" -, "That's it! He had some inkling of this affair; indeed, his lordship thinks that that's what turned his brain, and, lest he should tell more than we cared to have known, he sent him here, but stipu- lated that he should be well taken care of.' But what can be keeping that porter so? Hark!'I hear voices, and there goes a gate. Hark! it's the little east gate; they are all made to grate on their hinges, so as to be heard when opened. Let's gal- lop around there!" It was all a ruse, manufactured in Mr. Jerome's brain, just to get them away from the carriage- house, in order that the carriage might be got out, which was done in an incredibly short time, and the duchess and Milly already seated in it, and the rest of the party about to enter, when the two men came galloping back upon them, and demanded   174   THE DUKtES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. who they were, prowling about at this time of night?    ; "May I ask who you are," said Mr. Jerome, "prowling about this asylum, and interrupting hon. est travelers as they pass? I think," turning to Jake, "that we'll drive on and inform Dr. Thorn- cliff that two of his lunatics have escaped!" "I am Dr. Thorncliff, and forbid this carriage- which I see is mine-proceeding farther till I know who it contains!" catching hold of the reins. "Honest travelers, indeed, escaping with my horse and carriage! That's interesting! ' turning to his brother, and at the same time adjusting his dark lantern, so that the light would fall on the in- mates of the carriage. "Ah! a quakeress, I see! Friend Forsith! Glad to see you, madam!" making a mock bow. "Won't madam alight and spend the night, as it is quite late, and there is every ap- pearance of a storm?" reining his own horse close up to the carriage, and putting in his hand as if to assist her out. "Back, villain!" cried Mr. Jerome, in a tone of thunder, catching the doctor's hrorse by the rein and leading it suddenly to one side. And then to Milly, "Drive on, while we keep these ruffians at bay!" "Spur after them, brother! On your life let them   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   175 not escape!" shouted the doctor, trying all the ime to extricate his horse from the iron grasp of Mr. Jeromne. "Not so fast!" thundered Mr. Jerome, leveling his revolver at the head of the horse he held, which the next instant was wallowing on the ground in the agonies of death. Then with the other revolver he shot the brother's horse through the heart. Instantly extricating themselves from their dying steeds, they both rushed upon Mr. Jerome-the brother, who was unarmed, holding him, while the doctor, with one furious pass of his dagger, laid him weltering upon the earth. "Damn you!" muttered the doctor between his teeth. "I know you! we've met before! You es- caped me once, but you won't this time!" poising his dagger to give the finishing stroke. But again, as had been the case several years be- fore, the lunatic sprang upon him and, catching him by the arms, held him firmly, while Jake and the brother were contending with their fists. "How long the lunatic might have mastered the doctor had he continued rational is not known; as it was, however, he soon relaxed his hold and began to cry," THow long! oh Lord, how-." But the sen- tence was never finished. The doctor had taken *   176  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. advantage of the poor fellow's wandering mind, and witt the dagger laid him by Mr. Jerome! The bloody arm was again raised over Mr. J'erome, but the fatal blow was arrested by a voice from be- hind, crying, "Hold! Is this Thorncliff's Private Lunatic Asylum?" "It is!" answered the doctor, turning square round. "Is Dr. Thorncliff on the premises?" "I'm Dr. Thorncliff!" replied he, in a tone to defy the universe. "Well, then, Dr. Thorncliff; or rather Dr. William Stranton, in the name of the queen, in the name of the commonwealth, in the name of his grace, the great and noble Duke of Groveland, in the name and in behalf of the amiable and much injured, if not already murdered Duchess of Groveland, I make you my prisoner!" riding up and laying his hand firmly on the doctor's shoulder. "All gammon! every bit of it! By what right do you call me Dr. William Stranton? I thought we were friends, and parted not three hours ago on the best of terms. Now here you are, arresting me!' "Dirks and dark lanterns! and dead or wounded men, I believe to my soul! Faugh for such friend- ship! Gentlemen, surround these fellows and hand- cuff them, every one of them!" exclaimed the sher-   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   1" iff, without paying the least heed to Dr. Thornclif's remonstrances. Ought not these wounded men to be cared for? Let them be carried to a place of shelter and their wounds dressed," said one, seen now for the first time, and who rode with a majestic air and spoke in a tone of authority, though at the same time a strikingly saddened one. But what was there in it that sh6uld cause poor Jake to shiver, and Dr. Thorncliff to utter that terri- ble oath and give so lion-like a start as to actually upset two of the men who were putting handcuffs on him. It was none other than the Duke of Groveland. Knowing which, and that he supposed his duchess still within the asylum, what wonder that with his own hand he hurriedly opened the gate, strode'im- petuously up the broad walk, and was the first to enter the asylum.

"I mahe to say that as yer grace has watched ivery night with the sick men for at laste two wakes, woff't you rest a bit jist, as becomes a great gintle- meon like yerself."

Leave me now, Michael, and see that you keep within call." "I'll do that same immadiately, yer grace," bow- ing himself out of the room, and mentally anathe- matizing the duke for his want of confidence in him. "Sure," said he, "and has n't Michael O'Nail   THE DUIK1S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    179 just as good taste for taking care of the sick as the best duke that ever was born?

Here Michael's soliloquy ended in whistling "' The Wearing of the Greer." The duke adjusted his lounging chair out on the portico, so as to command as full a view as possible of the line moon-lighted landscape, and was about to compose himself for the night, when the sick man moved-the duke was instantly on his feet-rose up, and leaning on his elbow looked scrutinizingly around, and called in a half whisper: "Jake, did they get away?" "Who?" said the duke, coming forward.   180   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "The duchess and Milly. But who are you?" rubbing his eyes. "Am I dreaming?" "I do n't think you are, my doubly-tried friend," said the duke, taking his hands in his, and laying him gently back on the pillow, kneeling by his bedside, and still pressing his hands in his own. "The duchess has indeed gone, and has not been heard of since." "Since when, five minutes ago? I'm sure it is n't longer than that since I told Milly to drive off. But who are you, any way?" "Nobody but your afflicted friend, George Win- ton." "His grace, the Duke of Groveland! Why, how does your grace?" making an effort to rise, but the duke held him down. "Are you the Duke of Groveland though?" looking him full in the face. " ou do look like him. And yet it can 't be; it is n't reasonable to suppose that three min- utes ago I was' in the road defending the duchess from two ruffians, and now in bed, with the Duke of Groveland kneeling before me. It can't be so, unless I've been tampering with Rip Van Winkle's flagon." The duke laughed in spite of himself, as the vision of Rip, as he awoke from his long sleep, rose before him.   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   181 "No," said he at length, assuming his wonted look of melancholy, "you have not been tamper- ing with flagons exactly, but villains, who handled you so roughly that for two weeks you have been just balancing between life and death. This is the first day that your physician has been able to give me decided assurances of your recovery." "Have I been wounded then? But how, and where?" trying to rise. "Do n't try to rise," said his grace, hblding him down. "You were wounded in the abdomen with a dagger, but we think that you must also have received a blow on the head, as at the time we found you you were entirely insensible, and lay weltering in blood. The best surgeons to be found in Canada, and also in New York, pronounced your wound dangerous, if not fatal; and to arrest and prevent any tendency to inflammation, recom- mended that you be kept lethargized with mor- phine. To-day it was thought advisable that it be discontinued, for a time at least, and this is the first sign of intelligence that your lordship has shown since the tragedy. And now, my true, tried friend, let me earnestly entreat you to keep quiet, to turn your mind off these exciting topics until you are stronger and better able to bear them.  5   182  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. Do n't you think yourself that such a course would be advisable?" ' "I think, with your grace, that in such cases- all excitiqg causes should be avoided, where such a course is feasible. But Iv have studied medicine, have studied surgery, have practiced as assistant, surgeon in her majesty's army, and have never yet met with an instance where an effort to ttirn the mind off that which it longed to investigate did not cause a tenfold greater tendency to feverish excitement than the most rigid investigation would. In the present instance, I think that a pretty thorough investigation would almost work a cure. If your grace will condescend/ to satisfy me as to where I am, how I came here, what has become of the villains, and how your grace happened to ar- rive just as the tragedy was being acted, I think I can rest as contentedly and quietly as a lamb." "Well done! Your lordship is so much of a philosopher, and plead your cause so well, and I am so firm a believer inl the proverb, 'Suspense is worse than reality,' especially in the case of active minds, that I think that I will venture to comply with your request. In the first place, then, you are in Thorncliff's Private Lunatic Asylum!' "What!" said his lordship, well nigh leaping out of bed.   THE DUK E'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   183 ( That 's nsot very lamb-like," said his grace, lay- ing him back on the bed and passing his hand soothingly over his forehead. "Not as a lunatic, your lordship. I should modify the expression; you are in what was Thornclift's Private Lunatic Asylum. It is that no more; it is to be razed to the ground, or changed into some institution of benevolence, which I have not as yet fully deter- mined. You are here by my order, until you are able to be removed to some better place." "But how came your grace to get here just at that particular time, the very night of the trag- edy?" asked his lordship, with flashing eyes. "Ah, that requires a little going back. Some six or eight months ago, two little girls were walk- ing home from Sabbath-school, in Western New York. As they walked along, hand in hand, en- gaged in their infantile prattle, a mysterious and very suspicious man-whom I judge to be Dr. Stranton himself-came suddenly upon them, and after questioning them very closely, intrusted the elder of them with a letter to a man who passed himself off as their father. As he did not return home that night, she-having been charged not to let it be known to any other person that she had the letter-kept it about her person, and being the   184   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. next morning sent on an errand, carried it with her. While on this same errand, when attempting to cross a dangerous creek on the ice, she suddenly went into an air-hole, and was about drowning, when she was overheard and rescued by Mr. and Mrs. Mills-foster parents of my duchess, who at my request had come over to the United States, with a view to residing about in different localities, with their eyes open, in order, if possible, to dis- cover the place of concealment of my family-- who while here passed by the name of Iamilton. On removing her wet clothes, this letter was found, which Mr. Mills read with a design of ascertaining who the little girl was. But, some- how, he could n't understand the letter. It was exceedingly ambiguous. As he re-read it, however, a suspicion of the truth flashed across his mind, and the more he read it and questioned the little girl, the more he was convinced that she was my child-my Estella. He finally sent a copy of the letter to me, and a few weeks after returned to England, bringing the little girl with him. She proved to be, as he supposed, my own lost Estella. I instantly recognized her from her resemblance to her mother. By questioning her and studying the letter, I had every reason to believe that my duchess and my other child, though still alive, were in great MY   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. -  185 peril. What to do I did n't know. To reach and rescue them would be a difficult, and for them a dangerous operation; for, very likely, on the least alarm their keepers would murder them. I knew not whom to consult, as men of high standing were evidently in league with him-I mean Dr. Stranton. Everywhere were his agents, ready to inform him of every move I made; and as they were evidently determined that the duchess should never be taken from them alive, on the least ap- proach of danger they would, probably murder her, and then take to flight. With this startling fact in view, I dared not show signs of having any- thing unusual on my mind; I durst not be seen to have confidential conversation with any one. In- deed, I did not dare to appear to own my own child. Estella does not know that I am her father; she passes as a pupil of Mr. Mills, and is not allowed to communicate with any one when not in the presence of Mrs. Mills. I do n't sup- pose I ever left home for a day but the fact w2rs communicated to Dr. Stranton. Thus I went on from day to day, suffering the most untold agonies of mind, feeling that something must be done, and that speedily; and yet how could I proceed with- out defeating the very end I was aiming at? Then it was that I thought of your lordship;  i.   186  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. ,I of all your true, tried friendship; of your wisdom, and your tact in managing everything almost as you pleased, without arousing suspicion. As I saf one morning in my library, wishing you were only present, judge of my joy when his royal highness, Prince Albert, the very soul of h9nor, wisdom, and prudence, was announced. A long consultation with him resulted in his asking me, taking care that it was in the presence of others, to take a ride with him into the country. I, ac- cording to our preconcerted plan, declined, alleging. as my reason that I was not at all well. He insisted that the country air would do me good. I finally, though very reluctantly, yielded to his importu- nity. We went immediately to an out-of-the-way residence, which his royal highness was often in the habit of visiting, and had it rumored that I was taken dangerously ill. He dispatched mes- sengers for his physicians, with whom he had an interview before they saw me. On examining my symptoms, they shook their heads and pronounced my case a very critical one; said that my only hope of recovery was in my being kept absolutely quiet; forbade my seeing any company whatever, even my own attendant, whom I pretended' to want. "In reply to the many questions with which they were assailed, as to my disease and the possibility of   THE DUIKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   187 my recovery, they invariably Ahook their heads, looked solemn, and answered that, 'His grace's do- mestic troubles had proved too much for him; that tley feared for his mind.' And just as all England was in a commotion about the severe illness and prob- able insanity of the Duke of Groveland, I was dis- guised as an Irish peasant, and on my way to Bel- fast, where, with a letter from the prince, sewed in between the lining and outside of my blue round- about, to a confidential friend among the authorities here, and another to the governor-general, I em- barked for Canada. "I landed here on the first day of April; but the tug of war was not yet over. Iindeed, it was hardly begun. The letter gave no clue as to the part of Canada in which the asylum might be found; and we durst not inquire, lest some of these same agents, stationed here very likely as well as in England, might take the alarm and I yet be defeated. The few friends admitted to the secret of my mission held consulta- tion after consultation as to the best method of pro- cedure. After all our deliberati6ns we concluded that, on account of the great need of caution, the safest plan would be for me to take the field myself, in my peasant garb, and they be ready with assistance when the right time came. Not knowing exactly where to look for the asylum, I went over to the   188   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. State of New York, thinking some hint might come from thence. I walked through the oak-openings where my little daughters had been surprised last fall. Welnt to the little frame school-house where they attended Sabbath-school. Then searched for the miserable hovel they called home, thinking to see my other little one, but found that it had. been burnlt to the ground only a short time before. I did n't dare to inquire for the inmates. I visited Pine creek, where my child came so near losing her life. Went to Lake Island, where my beloved duchess had spent so many sorrowful days, and then returned to Catada, determined to findt her if it was in the. power of man to do so. "I traveled from town to town, lingered about stables, billiard saloons, kitchens, bar-rooms, any place where I thought there was any hope of gain- ing the inlfor'mat'ion I sought. Set on foot con- versations respecting lunatic asylums and doctors. Did everything in that direction, in short, but actually ask for Thorncliff's Private Lunatic' As3ylurn or for Dr. Thornclilf. iBut no one ever broached the sub- ject. I began to think that there was no such place. "When at length the day arrived on which the fatal deed was to be done I was frantic. The thought that ny ducteiess as that day to die by the hands of foul murderers was more than I could bear. I had   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE    189 dreamed of her all night; and finally, with her dead and mangled body clasped convulsively in my arms, I awoke, thankful- that it was as yet but a dream. It was just dawn. I hurried on my rough clothies and rushed out into the road, and walked with nerv- ous speed straigltforward, I knew not whither, call- ing on God as I went, to-as undeserving as I was- have mercy on me and mine. Once I stopped, and kneeling by the road-side, told Him, in the agony of my soul, that if He would save my duchess, my es- tates, title, family, myself, and everytliing that I had or could have, should henceforth be at his service. As I resumed my walk I obeyed an irresistible im- pulse to turn off to my right on a little by-road, where I shortly after observed two men on horse- back coming toward me, but so deeply engaged in conversation as not to notice me. As we approached ,each other I recognized one of them as no other than Dr. Stranton. I confess to have been a little startled at fidinding myself, alone and unarmed, almost face to face with my mortal enemy. And although the recognition was evidently not mutual, I felt a good deal relieved at spying a foot-path leading off into the woods. This path I followed, intending to 'watch them from a distance. What was my surprise, however, when I heard them turn down the same path. Wrhat was to be done? I supposed that a   190  THE DUKIE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. collision was now inevitable; and, to tell the truth, had I been placed on anything like an equal footing with the-villains, nothing would have suited me bet- ter than a combat with them. As it was, I resolved to sell my life as dearly as possible; but they passed on without giving me even a,passing glance. My' havring turned oft before them, their turning and finally passing me gave me the best opportunity in the world for following them, which I did until they stopped at a little inn. I stopped also; but instead of going into the house loitered about the stable with the hostler. Pretended to be an hostler' from Toronto. Remarked on the beauty of the hoirse he was cleaning. "'Yes,' said he, 'the doctor always rides -fine horses.'  "' The doctor!' said I. ' What doctor?' "' Why, Dr. Thorneliff, him what has the crazy folks.' "'Crazy!' said I. 'Is he crazy?' "'No, no! he keeps 'em what is, at- his house. It's him what lives in that big house up on the hill like, as you goto Toronto. You must a seen it as you come along from Toronto; or did you come the big road?' "'I do n't know what road I did come on. I come on two or three,' replied I.   THE DUKIE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   191 "'Well, it's the one what the path leads to.' I now noticed for the first time that the narrow foot-path was the only medium of access to or from the house. I noticed further that this path only communicated between the by-road and the house. This, then, thought I, is the rendezvous of the villains. There is n't much travel on it, and not many housen; there is n't any housen between here and the 'sylum, and it's- as much as twenty mile.' "' CWhat! said I, 'twenty miles of straight road, and not a house on the way?' ' That 's so,' said he. ' You go out at that are path to the road, turn to your right, and walk straight on-the road's mighty crooked, but then it 's all the same road-for twenty mile, and then you look off to your left and see a beautiful place, and that's the 'sylum. I've. been there often to carry coffins. Do n't be frightened,' he continued, as I gave a little start at the mention of coffins, 'crazy folks has to die as well as other folks. I carried a coffin there yesterday for a boy or a woman; it was a little thing.' "The allusion to a coffin for a woman was quite too much for me, and I turned to walk off without replying.   192  TIE DUIKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "'Hello! are you going without anything to drink?' asked he. "'Yes,' said I, as soon as I could speak as care- lessly as I thought the circumstances demanded. 'I only just came in because I saw you was a brother hostler, and I wanted to see how you man- aged horses, and how wages was now; and I guess I 'll have to go now, as- I've got a good deal to do afore I go back. I want to go' to the main road, but I do n't know how to manage without going back the same way I came, for this path do n't go any further.' "'I could tell you,' said he, with a knowing look, 'if I was sure you'd keep dark.' "Trust me for that,' said I, winking and placing my finger on my nose, after the manner of some of the class I was trying to personate, and added, ,Perhaps I shall have a chance to do as good a turn for you some time when you come to To- ronto.' "'That's so,' said he, giving the air a tremen- dous blow with his curry-comb, and coming to-the door, said, ' Do you see that tree a few yards ahead of you?  -, I nodded assent.' "'Well, if you go to it, you 'll see it has a nick on one side, and three or four yards straight ahead   TfH'E D UKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.  193 from that you'll see another tree sawed the same way -; a little ahead of that is another, and so on from here to the high road. Now keep dark.' "I again winked, placed my thumb on my nose, bade him good day, and set out, with my brain in a whiirlwind of excitement. I hurried forward; find- ing my pack impeded my progress, I left it in the woods, and ran as no man ever ran be'ore. Could I only reach the road in ti me for the stage froni Toronto, which would be along in a short time and would go directly through the place where I knew the sheriff-with whom the governor-general had held a private correspondence-was in waiting for nle. "Thanks to Him to whom I had that day com- mitted my cause, I reached the road a few minutes before the stage passed; the horn was then blowing. I had a few minutes to takle breath before it came up. It was full, but the driver, seeing that mine was no ordinary case, took me on the box with himself. I told him of my great haste; that it was a case of life and death, and that if he could land me at-- by six o'clock, no reward would be considered too great. He said he should be glad to accommodate me, but with his heavy load it would be impossible. Re said, however, that at the next inn he thought he could assist me to procure a good horse that, he   194  THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. had no doubt, would enable me to make the time. In five minutes after we reached the inn, I was on my horse, and rushing along the road with the speed of lightning. I reached the sheriff's head- quarters at precisely eight minutes before six! He told me that Dr. Stranton had but just gone; that to blind his eyes, and lull to sleep any suspicions that might possibly have arisen at his being in this part of the country at this lparticular time, he had received him with unwonted cordiality; that they had drank together, and pledged to each other their eternal friendship. "' But,' said he, 'how terribly will we undeceive him before morning, if we are prospered. Good enough for him though, for having palmed himself off on me for an honest man for so long a time!' "In an hour's time the sheriff's posse were collected, and we all ready for a start. We had five hours wherein to ride thirty miles, which we could easily do if all things proved fair. But the road was long, crooked, and unimproved. In addition to which the recent rain had in many places completely cov- ered it with water, and in others it was very muddy. The night was extremely dark, and none of us accustomed to the road or that part of the country. I was in an agony of apprehension; every delay or mishap made me frantic with fear for my duchess.      \   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    195 The kind-hearted men seemed to feel for my distress, and made every possible effort to make the time. But, alas! we were behind the time by two hours. Forever too late had not your lordship been here before us. Too late to rescue her; but just in time to save her preserver! We were just in time to ar- rest the hand that was already raised to give the finishing blow to your lordship's life. "Sir James Glenchest er, who it seems had flown to your relief after the first thrust of the dagger, had, after long contending, been stabbed and laid at your side, and the villain Stranton was in the very act of aiming the knife at your lordship's heart, when the sheriff cried, ' Hold!' They were all arrested, and are now on their way to England to await trial for their lives. Jacob Wettelly, my former horti- ' culturist, was, it seems, drawn into the plot unwit- tingly. Hle astonished me with an account of the long train of wire-working brought into play to seduce him. Letters to Dr. Stranton, purporting to come from me, were shown him; in,which I was represented as denying the legality of my marriage with the duchess, and declaring my full intention of marrying Lady Glenchester, and imploring Dr. Stranton to remove the poor duchess as soon and far as possible from the scenes of her shame and sorrow, giving him permission to take such of my   196   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. servants as he chose to assist him. Poor Wettelly- who would almost walk on his head for my sake- felt honored in being, as he supposed, the first one selected, thinking he was not only doing me a great favor, but the duchess also, in saving her feel. ings. On his knees ho craved mj pardon, not from punishment, for that he feels he deserves and is willing to suffer, so he can know that he is once more re-instated in my favor. I assured him of my good opinion and wishes, and promised to use all my influence in procuring his full pardon, which promise I shall keep; but in behalf of the others I have as yet no plea to offer. Is your lordship satisfied?" feeling his pulse, and then laying his hand on his forehead, which he found quite cool and moist. "No," said his lordship. "There are a few more points on which I wish to besatisfied, and then I can rest contentedly for the present. In the first place, this Sir James Glenchester-is he a lunatic?" "He was;, at least, so I have heard, and I have several timesbeen given to understand that he was in a lunatic asylum; but I never dreamed that it was here." "You say he was; what is he now?" "He is now passed to that bourne where lunatic3 are unknown!" * i 1   TE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   197 "Did he die of the wound he received in my be- half?" "He did." "Immediately?" "No; he lived till the next day." "Was he crazy to the last?" "We can not tell certainly, but we think not. He never spoke; but he evidently recognized me, and he seemed very happy, which they say was not the case when his crazy fits were on him." "His not speaking was another evidence of his sanity; he generally spoke too much; though it's likely he was very weak from loss of blood." "he was very weak from loss of blood, but that was not the immediate cause of his loss of speech. It seems that the knife, which was aimed at the neck, entered it in such a way as to sever the vocal cords. That, to be sure, would not prevent his whispering, which he did ; but as it requires great strength to be able to articulate distinctly in a whisper, what the poor fellow said w\as not under- stood, for he was indeed very weak. He some- times laughed, gesticulated, and from his whole appearance you would take him to be in the enjoy- ment of the most ecstatic delight. He gave me one piece of information for which I shall ever be. thankful, and which spoke a volunle of my duch-   193  THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. ess. Every time I came into the room he seemed distressed to speak to me. He motioned me to. him, pulled my head down to his, and tried to whisper in my ear. But, alas! with all his efforts, and my own too, I understood nothing. At last, as one of the surgeons stood over him examining his wound, he happened to spy one corner of a piece of paper that the surgeon had put into his pocket to write prescriptions on. Quick as thought he caught at it, possessed himself of it, and mo- tioned for a pencil, and with the greatest difficulty he finally succeeded in writing, 'She prayed for your grace.' Then, motioning me to him, pressed it into my hand, and with a smile of satisfaction threw himself back on his pillow, so completely exhausted that in a few minutes he breathed his last." "Where is the poor fellow's body?" "Sent on to his brother, Lord Glenchester, who was veiry fond of him. I sent his lordship a letter of explanation, with a few words of condolence, though my own grief was so poignant that I could. say but little." "Yodur grace is under greater obligations to Sir James than you are aware of. But for him, the duchess would at this moment be where he is. He first heard her cries and pleadings, the clanking of   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   199 her chain, and her nervous steps as she paced the floor. He first spied out the spring locks and trap doors that led to her garret, and administered to her comfort. And when I arrived before the gate, he, fortunately for the duchess, was the first to meet me. He assured me that she was here; told me of her retreat, and how to find it. But for him I should have been poisoned by the porter. But for the knowledge which he gave me respect- ing the library's being the only means of access to the duchess, I should never have thought of put- ting the porter to sleep; and had he not been asleep, the gate would have been unlocked to the ruffians long before your grace arrived. I arh well convinced that he was a good man, though insane. It's strange how soon the name of Jesus or Savior would calm him when in his wildest paroxysms. There are a few other matters that I wish to speak of, or rather ask about. Has your grace heard anything of a mysterious passage extending from garret to cellar? Has it been explored? I have heard of a catacomb being connected with the asylum; has your grace any knowledge of that?" "There is indeed a catacomb, and the mysterious passage you speak of leads to it. Why they fixed upon such a mode of entrance is as yet a mystery. We found that the passage led from the roof, down   200   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. . through four stories and the cellar, to the cata- comb, which is under the cellar." ' Have you explored the catacomb?" "Partially, and have found between eighty and ninety dead bodies under its pavement, most of whom, the doctors give it as their opinion, are men of rank. Whether they were lunatics, and how they came to their death, is yet to be ascer- tained. In the stomach of one of them, whose death appeared to be of a more recent date than the rest, there were found large quantities of ar- senic, while the brain seemed to be in a per- fectly healthy state. This is all that we know at present, but their cause shall have a hearing, the story of their wrongs shall be known, and they shall be righted, as far as it is possible to right the dead." "I think I have it in my power to assist in right- ing them, but I will not speak till the proper time," said Lord Ransler; and reaching out he began to stroke the duke's hair, and said, "Trouble tells on your grace, as well as on your duchess. Although your hair is of that beautiful color that seldom turns gray, I see it is already streaked with white. Her grace's is all as white as snow!" Tile duke groaned aloud, and rising, began to pace the floor.   TIIE DUKEIS WONDERFUL ESCAPE.  201 CHAPTER XII. 4IS is thee's room as long as thee wishes to stay," said Mary Goodheart to the stranger, who had given her name as Annie Ca-mpbell. "Thee will say this is the best bed thee ever slept in," she continued, turning down the clean, cool linen sheets, and thlen, opening the door of a little bath room, added, "In here thee will find plenty of clean water, soap, towels, and brushes, which I know will rejoice thee's eyes, for the goodly mind always loves cleanliness. In this drawer is fresh linen for thee, and I will bring thee a clean gown and cap in the morning before thee needs them. Thee need n't be in any hurry -about rising in the morning. Thee 's so tired thee may lie as long as thee pleases, and rest thee's self; and let thee come down when thee will, thee shall find a nice warm breakfast awaiting thee. And now I will leave thee here to thy rest, while I go down to wait for Thomas Goodheart, my husband, who has been absent since morning, attending a meeting of Friends. Why does' thee sigh, Annie? Does it   202  THZE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. remind thee of seven years ago, when thee sat up all night, one night, to wait for thy husband, who did n't come till morning, and then brought thee only trouble? But Thomas will come; he is an honest man, and never yet deceived me. Good- night, my poor, weary, hunted lamb!" pressing Annie's hand, and kissing her forehead. "Thee s had much trouble and -sorrow; but dry thee's eyes, for I feel that the Good Shepherd hath sent thee to me; and with Thomas Goodheart's consent, thee shall never more want a home." So saying, Mary tripped down stairs, and with knitting-work in hand seated herself in an antique settee with rockers. But as she gazed down the road in the direction from whence she expected Thomas to come, the knitting needles stood still, and the clear light of the moon, as it came stream- ing into: the porch, revealed not only the drab dress, white handkerchief pinned across the breast, plain cap, and usually tranquil forehead, bit tears on either cheek. As she brushed themaway, there was a rustle, a footfall, and, "A penny for thy thoughts, Mary!" said Thomas Goodheart, Istep- ping into the porch. With a little start of joy, Mary rushed forward, exclaiming, "Thrice welcome to thy home this night, Thomas Gtoodheart!"   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    203 Thomas folded her to his broad breast, saying, "What aileth thee, Mary? What means this tremor of voice between laughing and crying, and those tears that I saw thee brush away? 'Did thee think I would n't come?" "I knew thee would come, Thomas, if thy life and health were spared, for thee is an honest man, and never yet deceived me. The tears were not for thee." "Then what were they for, dear? Thee must let thy husband know!" leading her to the settee and seating himself beside her. "They were not for thee, Thomas. Thee is too -good a husband to cause tears. Does thee remem- ber that it is just fifty years to-night since thee first brought me to this house a bride?" "Let's see; the .fifteenth of June. So it is! And'we sat in a settee, I remember, and thee wept at thy new responsibilities, and I kissed away the tears. Shall I do so to-night? There!" said he, after bestowing a dozen kisses. "Now thee must weep no more! I can not bear it, for I love thee a hundredfold more to-night than I did then, Mary!" pressing her to his heart. "Thee has ever been a faithful, loving husband, Thomas. In all these fifty years thee has never caused me to shed a tear I "   204   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. CAnd thee has been a true, devoted, and afCec- tionate wife, Mary!" pressing his lips to hers. "Does thee know the old settee, Thomas? It is the very one we sat in that night; the one we rocked our first baby in, before we got a cradle. I had it broiught down to-night for thee to see, and that we might have our golden wedding in it!" "Thee is a thrifty, thoughtful little wife!" tight- ening his arms about her, as if afraid his treasure would escape; "and I think we will keep it here for us to sit in every night, and I will always pre- tend that there are tears to kiss away. Sit still! Thee can not leave my arms till thee has told me all about what caused the tears.' "Well, husband, I will tell thee. Does thee re- member that passage in Hebrews which says, ' Be not forgetful to entertain strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares?"' "I do, Mary. And has thee been entertaining strangers in thy husband's absence?" "( Yes, Thomas; I have this day entertained an angel!" "And did thee weep because the angel ahd de- parted?" "She hath not departed; she now sleeps in our front chamber. Her husband was not true like thee, Thomas. It was her sad story that made me   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   205 weep. She is a poor, weary, hunted lamb, and with thy consent-after thee has heard her pitiful story- she shall hereafter make this house her hrome." "It shall be just as thee says, Mary. I can trust to thee." "Nay, Thomas, it shall be as thee says. If, after hearing her pitiful story, thy superior judgment does not say she had better remain with us, then I can say,' Go thy way, Annie, and may the ' Good Shepherd' go with thee!' " "That's just the way thee always does, Mary. Thee always defers to me, when thee knows that thy wise little head can judge better than I can. But thee shall have thy way in the matter. Thee may tell me her story, and I will weigh it well, and then give thee my honest thoughts on the subject. Annie Campbell, I think thee said her name was? -That is a great and honorable name, as the world- looks upon honor. It originated among the high- land clans of Scotland. I'll engage thee she is Scotch. The Campbells are a branch of the re- nowned and persecuted McGregor family. It hav- ing been made a crime to bear the name of McGregor, they were obliged to assume other names, and one very powerful branch took the name of Campbell., Rob Roy was of that clan. He, as thee knows, was not very angelic. I think   206  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. that this angel that thee speaks of must be very different from the rest of her name." '6 Thomas, she is angelic because she hath been with Jesus--Him who could have made an an:gel of even poor Rob Roy. She is meek and lowly, like our great Elder Brother. But thee shall hear her story from her own lips, and judge for thee's self." 'She fell into good hands when she fell into thine, Mary. How came she to find thee ' " "Perhaps thee remembers a very godly fugitive slave, by the name of Milly, who spent a week with us, four or five years ago, while ion her way to a land of freedom, whom thee took to Canada in a covered wagon? Well, this same Milly ac- companied Annie as far as the boundary line be- tween Canada and this State, and, not daring to come into the United States, directed Annie to us. She came dressed in the very suit that we gave to Milly; I knew the old bonnet as soon as I saw it. After wandering about for more than a week, meet- ing with all kinds of unhandsome treatment, sleep- ing every night in the open air, and having scarcely anything to eat, she arrived this morning at our door, and was so overbcome at hearing a kind word, that, when I opened. my arms to receive her, she wept on my bosom. But I can not tell thee her   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    207 story so as to make thee feel the full force of it. Thee shall hear it from her own lips at the first favorable time." The next pleasant evening found Mary and Annie seated at one end of the long porch, while Thomas sat at the other, out of reach of their low earnest conversation, leaning forward, with his hands folded on the end of his staff, looking out into a quiet moon-lit field, and apparently lost in deep thought. "Say what thee will, Annie," said Mary Good- heart, "he hath treated thee very unhandsomely, and I can not think that he ever loved thee; for how could any one treat the dearest object of his earthly affections as he has treated thee? Nay, there can be no excuse for him. Oh, Annie! how he has tortured thy loving heart. First made sure that thee loved him for himself alone, by coming to thee in thy low estate, lonely orphan as thou wast, and pretending to be a poor lame sailor, of lower rank than thyself, and as such wooed and won thee. Then when he knew thy heart was all his own, threw off his dis- guise, took thee a bride to his grand home, and almost immediately, and frequently, right before thy eyes, when he saw how it grieved thee, began to give another all- those little loving attentions which he should have given only to thee--often rudely repuls. ing thee, when, in the presence of others, thee, in thy   208   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. tender solicitude, asked after his health or welfare in other respects, requiting thy loving kindness with cold, short, harsh answers, which would be inexcusa- ble in him even in speaking to an enemy. And how cruel of him to welcome to his home, against thy wishes, those whom he knew habitually treated thee with insolence. And that time, when insulted and almost heart-broken, thee timidly sought his side in the drawing-room as thy only protector, how heart- lessly he withdrew from thee to the other side of the room and joined in the laugh that was there going on at thy expense at thy unrequited love. What man of any heart could ever have done it, even if thee had not been his wife, and he had never pre- tended to love thee? And finally, after thee had given him two interesting children, he actually mar- ried this Lady Glenchester, and gave thee over into the hands of ruffians, who not only made thee marry one whom thee could not love, which I think must have been the greatest of all thy trials, but threw thee at last into a lunatic asylum. Oh, Annie! let me entreat thee to think no more of him, for indeed he is not worthy of thee. The quicker thee relin- quishes all thoughtof him the better for thee. Give all the love which thou hast lavished on him to thy Redeemer, who will not only not slight thy pool offering, 'but will never leave thee nor forsake thee."'   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   209 This last was said in so loud a tone as to rouse Thomas from his reverie; and moving his chair to- ward the middle of the porch, after a moment's silent prayer, he said, "Well, Annie, are thy feet so firnly fixed on the 'Rock of Ages,' that come wlat will, thee will never want to turn back to the 'beggarly elements of this world?"' "I hope so," said Annie, after a moment's pause. "Then I have news for thee. I had the same news this morning, but feared to tell it thee, lest thy woman's heart might lead thee into trouble. But if thy feet are really planted on the 'Rock of Ages,' and thee does not trust too much to thy own strength, that 'Eye which never slumbers nor sleeps' will watch over thee and keep thee from harm. I feared to tell thee, because, in relating the history of thy eventful life, I observed that whenever thee spoke of thy husband thee made such an effort to soften away all the hard points in his character, and thy voice took on such tenderness of tone whenever thee pro- nounced his name, that I saw that thy heart was still full of his image, which is perhaps all right in itself, only thee should love thy Maker most. Well, Annie, 'safely moored' as thee is in the 'Port of Peace,' with this 'Rock of Ages' towering up between thee and thy enemies, supposing thee should hear that thy husband, the Duke of Groveland, was in this   E DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. country searching for thee; that he had been in search of thee ever since thee was taken from him; that he had at last succeeded in tracing thee to 'Thorncliff's Private Lunatic Asylum,' and going thither with a body of men sufficient to rescue thee, arrived just after thee had escaped; and should say to thee through the public prints that the story of his having married another was false; that his heart was still all thine, and he should call on thee to re- turn to him that he might atone for the mistakes of his youth by devoting the rest of his life to thy hap- piness, what would thee do?" "Fly to him immediately!" exclaimed Annie, rising to' her feet, in a perfect flutter of excitement. Well, such is my news, Annie! The papers are all teeming with it. It is just as I feared, how- ever. I knew just what the woman's heart would say! Oh,/woman's love! what wilt thou not en- dure? what obstacles wilt thou not overcome?" said he, looking fondly at Mary. "It is natural, and all right for thee to love thy husband, if he can still be called thy husband, Annie.  But I advise thee to be cautious how thee decides what to do. Thee had better think and pray much over it be- fore thee takes any steps in the matter. Sit down, and let us reason the case. I told thee this news just as it came to me, not because I believe it,   but to do as I would be done by. Is it not very likely a ruse of thy enemies, just to get thee into their hands again? Is it not in.perfect keeping with their proceedings all along from the very outset? Does it not remind thee of that fatal let- ter of some two years ago, which was thrown in to thee, as thee sat watching thy sleeping babes, calling on thee to come to a certain place, where thy husband, the duke, was in waiting for thee, but did not dare to approach the house? And has thee forgotten how, when thee left thy chil- dren to obey the call of love, as thee neared the spot, expecting to fall into the arms of thy hus- band, thee was seized, gagged, blindfolded, and bound, and hurried off to a lunatic asylum ? And what warrant has thee that thy case would not be a still harder one this time ? What surety has thee that they would hesitate to 'break within the bloody house of life ?' And even if it is the duke, and he calls on thee in good faith to return to him, I do not think that thee is bound to go; for, to tell the truth, Annie, I think he is a man of very little heart! Why such conduct as his treatment of thee has been, is a stench in the nostrils of every true man of honor! And, besides, I do not know as thee has any right to go to him! Thee has been married to another, remember. But let that be as   212  THE DUKEIS WONDERFUL ESCAPE. it may, I think thee should look far above such a man. Thee, on whom the 'God of Jacob' hath looked with such especial favor! Yes, Annie, the Sovereign of the Universe hath sought thee out! He did not look coldly on thee because thee was despised by others. But when He saw thee sor- rowful and forsaken by all earthly friends, He came on swift wings to thy relief; found thee in thy humble prison-house; broke in pieces the chain of thy spiritual bondage; boight thee with a price; adopted thee intol His family; made thy heart l1is residence; thy body the temple of His spirit, thereby raising thee far above all earthly potentates, so far are earthly kings, even, below a true child of God! But even in an earthly point of view, thee is far superior to the Wintons! Thee is a McGregor! Thy father, Hugh Campbell, whom I knew well in his boyhood, traced his de- scent directly back to the great McCullum More, Marquess of Argyleshire, whom everybody knows was descended from the persecuted but royal McGregors. And the MacIntoshes, on thy mother's side of the house, are of very ancient renown. They took their name and badge from the wild cat of the forest. Thy family is far ahead of the Wintons in all except wealth, and who regards that as a mask of nobility? But what is nobility?   THE DUIKES' WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   213 We of the United States do not thhiuk xnlmch of second-handed nobility. We do not ask what was a man's ancestry, but, 'What is he? what is himself?' As for myself, I acknowledge no man as noble who has'not been made free by the New Birth. '" To all this expostulation Annie made no reply. Indeed, the latter part of it was wholly lost on her, for as soon as Thomas suggested that it might pos- sibly be all a stratagem, she felt sure it was; and the sudden revulsion -of feeling, the sudden fall from the highest hopes to the depths of despair, so completely paralyzed her that she seemed to have lost the power of utterance, and sat gazing straight before her, in mute agony; mentally accus- ing God of injustice. "Why had He attuned hez heart so nicely .to domestic love, and then removed all the objects of its gratification;' and why had He to-night permitted her expectations to be raised to an almost dizzy height by presenting hei with a cup purporting to be full of bliss, and lo I as she stooped to drink, it contained nothing bill a serpent." "Oh, God!" she at length exclaimed aloud, it the bitterness of her soul, looking upward, ' wil Thou -pursue Thy worm to death?" and without further remark, with a heart full of rebellion, she   214   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. sought her own room, closely followed by Mary, who, 4alarmed at her strange appearance slipped her arm around her waist, saying, "Poor Annie! Thy case is a hard one, but look to Jesus--He can make it all come right. Put thy hand ifi His and follow Him. 'He is thy Shepherd; He will lead thee into green pastures, and by'the side of still waters.' Good night, poor lamb!" Annie spent most of the night in feverish wake- fulness. Now pacing the floor with nervous ra- pidity, and anon, her elbows resting on the window- sill, andiher chin in her palms, she looked out at the pure, calm heavens, which, instead of mocking her grief, seemed to soothe her and speak of better days to come. She slept at last, a brief, troulled sleep, waking with the dawn and feeling that her brain was still on fire. She pressed her hand to her aching forehead, and wondered whether she had not really become a maniac, and whether she should not like to set out on a walk and walk straight forward forever? As she bathed her head, the cool, grateful water, as it trickled down over her throbbing temples, reminded her of the water of life, in which her parched, jaded soul had once been washed. She thought, too, of Jesus, and of the sweet peace and communion she had once enjoyed with Him, when, lo! He stood before   TIE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    215 her, with His crown of thorns, His bleeding side and hands and feet, and fixing on her a look which seemed to reproach her with His death. She fell at His feel; the fountain of tears opened, and she wept as if her heart were waters. An hour after, when Mary tapped softly at her door to announce breakfast, she was singing: "Lord, I make the full surrender, Every thought and power be Thine- Thine entirely, Through eternal ages Thine." She entered the breakfast-room with a sweet smile on her face, and a deep consciousness that God was all around about her, and that Jesus was at her side-that He was looking down upon her and smiling. "Well, Annie, how is it with thee by this time?" said Thomas. "Oh, well! All is well. Jesus is very precious to me, and my 'Peace is as a river.'" "And how about the duke?" "I love him still-I shall always love him! I have never been able to blame him; something within me always pleads for him. But I feel that I shall never see him again in this world.

The sun is within a few miles' march of Cedar creek, and the birds have been singing this long time, but Farmer Elton's folks, though very early risers, are not yet up. They are all asleep in that large bed-room off the dining-hall. Fredy, the little three-year old, is nestled in with her fa- ther and mother, while John, Will, and Hen-as they are called-occupy the frundle-bed. A pleas- ant sight, you think, but away out in the kitchen loft is one of still greater interest. Here, amid dust, cobwebs, barrels, boxes, heaps of beans, ears of corn, stacks of old clothes, with cast-off boots and shoes, besides multitudinous bunches of herbs suspended from the rafters, at the side of a cot kneels a little girl, possibly ten years of age. She is a-very timid child, and has often begged the privilege of sleeping near the family, which being refused, she has asked to have some of the children sleep in the same room with her, and that too being denied her, she has frequently gone to bed trem-   218   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. bling and weeping with fear, covering her head and face until she was almost suffocated. But last night-having worked very hard yesterday, besides being scolded and threatened with a whipping for something over which she had no control, and not being permitted to retire till almost twelve-she was too tired and sorrowful to think of being afraid. But as soon as she attained her garret, she threw herself on her knees before that Superior Presence of which she had-always felt a vague consciousness, a sort of indefinable sense inwrought into her very being, which grew with her growth, and which was corroborated by the teachings she had received in Sabbath-school. Into the ear of this great Omnipotent Invisible she poured her tale of sorrow, not in words, but in suppressed, overpowering sobs and tears, until over- taken by;" tired nature's sweet restorer." But here comes the sun, peeping cheerfully into the room, while one of'iis stray bearns walks boldly up and caressihigly kisses her on the cheek. Hark! "Greet! Greet! You goin' to lay thereall day? It's time to git up! and do n't let me have to call you agaii!" shouted a coarse, masculine voice. She rose hastily, showing an interesting-face, from whichD, with the exception of swollen eyes, all traces of last night's grief had disappeared, and in their   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   219 places sat the sweetest smiles. On going down stairs, and finding no one up, she first washed her- self in the little iron kettle which stood on a bench near the cistern; then, after making a fire in the kitchen-stove, she filled the tea-kettle with fresh water from the well, and set it over the fire; then washed some potatoes very nicely, cutting off the ends, for they were old, and put them into the oven to bake for her breakfast; after which she took two buckets and went out to the barnyard to do her share of the milking, which was generally seven cows, Mr. Elton and the hired man milking the other sixteen. --Two or three times she came in with a bucket in either hand, brimming full of white, frothy milk, which she strained into a large cheese tub, placed for the purpose; when Mrs. Elton said, "Breakfast is ready," and they all washed their hands and went in to eat; where occurred quite a lively conversation in reference to some company from the village, which Mrs. Elton expected would spend the day with her, though she said she would much rather they would stay at home, and mind their own business, in place of coming there to hin- der her when she had so much to do; yet if they did come, she supposed she should have to give them something to eat, which Mr. Elton had no doubt was all they were coming for, and he ordered the   220  THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. hired man' to kill half a dozen chickens. After breakfast, Mrs. Elton told Greeta she must fly about, and be very spry, and do most of the work that day, for she should be engaged with company. All this was said in a tone so much kinder than usual, that Greeta, who, when rightly treated, was one of the sweetest tempered little girls in the world, immedi- ately forgave all the ill-treatment of her mistress on the previous day, and determined to do all she could to please her byibeing as useful a child as possible. Her first step was to clear off the table, which, though seemingly of trifling importance, must be done with great neatness and precision, for Mrs. Elton was a very nice housekeeper, and had taught Greeta just how she wanted everything done. First of all, the knives-lest anything should get on the handles-were collected and put, handles up, into a'pitcher kept for the' purpose. The forks were put into a separate and smaller pitcher, lest they, being shorter, should get their handles soiled from the blades of the knives. These being con- veyed to the sink-room, all the spoons, little and big, were gathered up, and placed in the slop- bowl; then the remaining contents of the coffee- cups and saucers were poured into one, and the rest piled up on the waiter; after which all the plates were scraped off clean and piled up, with   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   221 the largest at the bottom. These being carried to the sink, the table-cloth was to be shaken-not on the grass or anywhere about the door, but aWay out in the chicken-yard-and then folded in the exact creases that had been ironed in it, and laid. away in a cupboard on one side of the dining-hall. The table was put back, the room swept, and, lastly, the yellow-painted floor washed with clean water. All this Greeta did in a very short time, and then passed to her work in the kitchen. Soon she heard a carriage, and in a few minutes more the door flew open, and she knew from the loud greetings that the guests had arrived. She would have liked to see how they looked, but con- tented herself by thinking how well she would try to please Mrs. Elton-how she would try to do everything just as she liked to have it done. Antl as she had always told her to attend to the knives and forks and spoons first, she washed and scoured them without wetting the handles; then, wiping them very dry, she got the knife-box, and put the knives and forks in one side of it-the knives at one end and the forks at the other-and the spoons in the other side, putting the large ones at differ- ent ends. On putting them away, she took the large linen milk-strainer, and, having washed it in cold water till she thought the milk was all out of   222  THE DUIKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. it, she washed it again in warm water and soap, and put it in a kettle of water on the stove to boil. After which she took all the tin milk-pans, some thirty in number, through the same process as the strainer, washing them in cold, then in warm wa- ter and soap; then poured boiling water on them, and, wiping them with a nice clean dish-towel, taking great pains with the creases at the top and bottom, and up and down the sides; and, last of all, she carried them forth to a table in the back yard, where she set them out singly, to go through with an all-day process of sweetening in the sun. The strainer having now boiled, she took it out, and, rinsing it thoroughly in cold water, spread it on some asparagus bushes in the yard. This done, she proceeded to wash and scald the cheese-tub and basket, as also the milk-buckets, and was  about to finish washing the breakfast-dishes, when it occurred to her that, perhaps, it would please Mrs. Elton to' have the pantry-shelves washed, and, thinking there was plenty of time for both them and the dishes before there was. anything else to do, she commenced upon them. When they were nearly finished, and she was thinking how nicely they looked, out came Mrs. E., who, on seeing the   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   223 unwashed dishes, broke forth into a great rage, saying: "You lazy, good-for-nothing thbing! what on earth have you been about? Here it is almost ten and not a dish washed!  Dernl you! you 're enough to try the patience of Job!" raising her hand to strike Greeta, whose lips began to quiver, as she said, imploringly: "Please do n't strike me, Mrs. Elton; I thought perhaps it would please you to have me wash these shelves, or I would n't have done it." "Do hear the fool,talk! Just as though I wanted you to go to house-cleaning on a day when I had company, and so much extra work to do! Leave it all this minute, and go and pick them chickens I You do beat all the fools I ever saw in my life!" and with that she flounced into the parlor, ex. claiming: "You think I have -nothing to trouble me, but here it is almost ten o'clock, and there that girl has been, ever since you came, and not a dish washed!" "Why, you do n't say!" said Mrs. Goodman. What in the world has she been about?" ex- claimed Miss Goodman. "That's more than I can tell! Sitting dowr with her halnds folded, I s'pose. I told 'her partic   224  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. ularly this morning, that I wanted she should work unusually well to-day, for I wanted to visit; but nothing you can say to her has any effect on her. It's the same thing over and over every day, no matter how much I'm hurried. She's- enough to try the patience of Job!" "Well, I declare I would n't put up with it. I'd whip her if I could n't make her mind in any other way," said Mrs. Goodman. "That's just what she ought to have, but I'm not strong enough to whip her myself, and Mr. Elton says he hates to strike the little thing, for her father might possibly come back and then there'd be a fuss about it." "Where is her father." "That's it; nobody knows. He brought her here about two years ago; said he was going to Europe; paid us for keeping her six months, and that's the last of him. When the six months were up, and he did n't come nor write, we put her to work, and this is the way she does. I wish Mr. Elton would whip her." "I can whip her, mother," said John. "Yes," said Will, "let us try it; we can make her stand round." "And I'll help," said Hen. .   THE DUIKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.  225 As no one replied, the three boys were instantly on their feet and started for the kitchen. "You John, Will, and Hen, come back here,' said their mother. "You want a fuss, don't you? You know if you go out there and 'get her to cry- ing she'll never stop, and will be of no more use all day. You'll have to wait till there isn't quite so- much to do." "Well, if we wait till night, when the work is all done, may we try it then?" urged John. "Yes, may we whip her then?" said Will. "Oh, hush up!" said their mother. "You don't know what you're talking about!" With that the three boys laid their heads together to consider upon the subject. They knew well that they could do whatever they pleased to Greeta after the company was gone, without their mother's inter- ference. "I'll tell you what, boys," says Will, after they were out, "let's go down into the woods and get us three good big gads, and after the company's gone we'll give her a good sound one." "One that she'll remember as long as she lives," said John. "Oh, let's," says Hen. And away they went, fully intent upon carrying their satanic purpose into practices   226  THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. CHAPTER XIV. REETA wiped her eyes and picked the chick- ens, then washed the dishes; after which she had ample time to finish the shelves, which she did, trying all the time to keep from weeping and to be cheerful, but the big tears would come in spite of her. Mrs. Elton was very unkind to her all the rest of the morning; and after dinner told her, in a very taunting manner, to see if she could be all the after- noon washing a few dinner-dishes, and after they were done to churn that cream that she had put into the churn. j For a very long time after the dishes were done did'Greeta turn that great box, two-thirds full of cream, from side to side, with a crank, till her little hands were nearly blistered, her arms ached clear up to her shoulders, and she was so tired all over. But the butter came at last, and, oh! how glad she was. After taking it out into a large wooden bowl she worked it with a wooden ladle till all the milk was out, then washed it in some clean cold   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    227 water, worked in some nice salt, and set it away in the cool cellar. As she stood before the pantry window, working the salt into the butter, the three boys passed shak- ing their long whips at her, and saying, "You'll take it to-night, Miss Greet. You'll take it." At first she smiled very innocently, supposing them to be only in sport; but when she took a second look, and noted the expression of savage determina- tion pictured on their faces, she felt fearful that they really did intend doing her some mischief. And feeling that she had no human protector her thoughts flitted silently away to the Mercy Seat, imploring protection from those naughty wicked boys, who were stronger than she, and in no danger of moles- tation from their mother, let them do what they would to her. Mrs. Elton now made her appearance, telling G-reeta to make' a fire and put the tea-kettle over, and then go out to milking, for Mr. Elton had gone to town and would not be back till late, and she must do his share of the milking and her own too. As Greeta passed the carriage-house on her way to milk she was again assailed by the boys, who put their whips tauntingly in her faoe, saying, "Oh, you'll take it, old Miss Greet! You'll catch it to- night after the company's gone; you'll catch it."   228  A'THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. Scarcely half the milking was over when she heard the ladies come out, and after urging Mrs. Elton, again and again, to visit them at an early day, they got into the carriage and drove off. "Now let's at her, boys, before father and Nate come!" said Will. "Oh, not in there! You'll raise the old Harry with all the cows; wait till she goes in with a bucket of milk. I'll stand down here and give her a cut or two; you give it to her when she gets to the gate; when she gets along by the cellar door Ren 'll come down on her with his whip, and while she goes up the steps Tude'll throw a whole basin on her from the porch," says John. Accordingly, as she came out with two buckets of milk, John gave her two or three such severe blows across the naked feet that she writhed with pain. As she came weeping along, with her head down, and not thinking of being attacked again, Will assaulted her, and treated her much more roughly than John had just done. This caused her to scream aloud, and to spill a great part of her milk. On seeing Hen, with his whip, she begged Mrs. Elton, who stood on the porch, not to let. him strike her; but that lady replied, "Oh, you fool you! Come along, he's not going to hurt you!" And  hen she did attempt to come, and he com-               .   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE..  229 menced to beat her with all his might over the neck, head, and shoulders, his mother only laughed and told her to come along, or she would come and help him. This was too much for Greeta's human nature to bear, and dropping the buckets, spilling all the milk, she ran off into the corn-field, and was making her way to the adjoining woods, when Mr. Elton, who had just come up in time to see her drop the milk, jumped out of the wagon and took after her with his horsewhip. He overtook her just as she was entering the woods, and, after giving her a cruel whipping, obliged her to return to the house. Poor Greeta was now almost heart-broken; not a ray of 'hope seemed to be left her. As she sat there on the porch, woepiug, and feeling---her- self utterly crushed, not even thinking of the Great Presence to whom she had the night before made complaint, Nate, the hired man, came by, and see- ing her th re alone, put his head down, and said, "Poor little Greeta! I saw it, and it's too bad! I'd run away! I would n't stay here another night, for they do n't treat you right!" And putting a silver dollar into her hand, he continued, "Here's all the change I've got; if it 'll be any help to you, you are welcome to it." Then, looking all around to be sure that no other person saw or heard, he added, "If you 're a mind to go, and are afraid to -!   230 -THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. go alone, I'll wait for you, up- at the orchard gate, as I go home. You wait till they're all asleep, and then you can steal out and come up there." "I 'll go!" said Greeta, brightening. With -two or three leaps Nate crossed the back yard, and passed into the corn-field, in which he walked until he was some quarter of a mile below the house, when he jumped over the fence into the road, and came whistling along up, as though he had been off somewhere, and was perfectly igno- rant and indifferent as to anything that had hap- pened to Greeta. He paused in front of the house, and called out to Mr. Elton, who was sitting at the front door, saying, -"I guess I'll go 'round home to-night, if you 've no objections, Mr. Elton; there's things't want tendin' to. I 'll be back afore sun- rise." "Very well," said Mr. Elton; "aid as you go along past Croy's, jest drop in and see if 'Bast'll come over and help us cut that red grass to- morrow." "I do n't believe I'll have time to-night, for I want to git home afore the folks is abed a spell. Won't in the mornin' do as well?" "Well, I do n't know but what it will, so you see him before he's off somewhere else." "I'll take good care of that!" said Nate, as he   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   231 went whistling off across the lots, the nearest way home. But no sooner was he out of sight and hearing, than he took a circuitous route, and came backl to the orchard gate, where, after waiting some time, he began to grow uneasy, fearing that Greeta had either concluded not to go, or had already been there, and, not finding him, had returned, or, per- haps, gone off alone. "It's too bad! It's a burning shame the way they do treat that child, and a better little thing never walked! If I was settled, she'should never; want for a home," mused Nate, stepping forward a little, " and if Mittie was of mind we'd be mIar- ried right after harvest; but-she thinks she. can t be ready afore Thanksgivin' no how. If I could persuade--." The last benevolent sentence was broken off by the appearance of Greeta. "That 's you!" exclaimed Nate. "1 was begin- nin' to think somethin' must've happened, and you would n't come. How did you manage? Did they mistrust anything was up?" "I do n't know whetter they mistrusted anything or, not," said Greeta. "Pretty soon after you went away, Mrs. Elton came out and told me that 'I could go to bed now, and see if I could get up some time to-morrow.' So I went right up stairs and put these things into this basket"'which Nate   232   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. gallantly took from her, saying, "I guess I can manage these better than you can!"--" and as soon as I thought they were all asleep, I slipped down stairs and came out here." "I'm glad you got away so easy, and, if you ain't too tired to trot on tol'rable fast, you 'll soon be out of their reach!" Greeta replied that "she was a pretty fast walker."  But little more was said for some time, as Nate was a man of few words, and Greeta was too much out of breath trying to keep up with him. They walked on and on; the moon rose, shedding her soft light over hill and dale, woods and clearings, greatly enhancing the beauty of each, and still they walked mutely on. Greeta-an impressible, imaginative little creature.-was enchanted with the holy quiet and loveliness of the scenes through which they passed, and looked wistfully at Nate, but he seemed in a very thoughtful mood, and not in the least inclined to talk. "Hallo!" he exclaimed at length, as they were just passing a little cross-road, "I guess we'd bet- ter turn off here, if we do n't want to go to Beech Lawn!" "To Beech Lawn?" said Greeta, with emphasis. "Yes; why?" asked Nate, at the same time turn-   THE DUKES tWONDERFUL ESCAPE.   233 ing toward Greeta, and partially doffing his straw hat, began to wipe his forehead with his red cotton pocket handkerchief. "Is n't that where Mrs. Gartmor lives?." asked Greeta. "Yes; but what of that? What do you know about lber? Do you remember her?" "O, yes! You know she was at Mrs. Elton's last spring, do n't you remember? And I like her so much; for one day when I was waslbing the dining- room floor, and the boys kept mu(ddying it all up as fast as I could wash it, and throwing (dirty water in my face with their hands, she nmade thenrl stop, and said they should n't trouble nie so much." ' A"ld what do you think I heard her say once?" said Nate. "I do n't know, what was it?" "Why, on9 day, whlen Mrs. Elton was running on against a little girl by the name of Greeta Mack, she said she 'd like to take you. She said she wa' n't afeared but what she could make something of you." "Oh, I should love to live with her!" exclaimed Greeta, fairly dancing with delight. Just then they heard the slight bark of a dog, and a large New- foundlander came bounding and prancing and whin-   234 .  HE D UKRE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.

"Yes; and this is my home, walk in," opening a rude gate into a small garden, back of which stood a humble, but neat and comfortable-looking log-house. '"Is that you, Nate?" said a big fat woman, poking her head out of the window with her night- cap on. "Yes, mother," said Nate, "are you abed?" "I was; but how late you are! I hadn't the leastes idee of seein' you to-night!" "Nor had I three hours ago; nor I should n't a come, if it had n't a been I wanted to bring you this little girl." "Is that little Greeta?" she asked, fly ing to the door and opening it, and exclaiming, "Come in, you poor little creeter! my heart's been a bleedin' for you this long time. Ever sence Nate's been a tellin' of me how the Eltons treated you, hare I been a longin' to git holt on you.

"   236  ETHE DUKEZ S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. CHAPTER XV. OME in!" :called out an oily-tongued man to a little barefooted girl, who stood at the door, with her sun-bonnet in one hand and a small bundle in the other. She had just come in out of the night, the sun having disappeared some hours before and the moon not yet risen. She had been walking by starlight; and judging front the number of lighted. windows that she must be in some village, she had rapped at this door to inquire if the village was Beech Lawn, and if so, to ask to be directed to Mrs. Gartmor's. Her rap was answered--as [has been seen---by a "' Come in!" from the oily-tongued man, who, having, caught sight of her bundle, and con- clutding her to be some poor child, in search of a place, repeated with some  eagerness, "Come in, come in, Sis; and take this chair!" pushing one to- ward her with his foot. "You are doubly welcome: we've been looking for you all day, and are very glad you've come." Whly, Travus!" exclaimed his wife, reaching out and giving his foot a push with hers. c   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    237 ,Why, it 's a fact! I 'll -leave it to Cutly, if I did n't ride all day yisterday in search of just suhell a little girl; and when I did l't have no success at all, I said this morning I'd sit down and wait for one to come; and sure enough, here she is, just the girl I wanted! I never was gladder to see anybody in my life!" Confused at such a reception, Greeta at length -faltered out, "Is this Beech Lawn?" " . Well, it ain't nothing else," said Mr. Travus, winking to the company'. "Well, will you please to tell me where Mr. Gartmor's folks live?" CGartmor! Gartmor!" repeated he, tapping his forehead with his fingers, and at the same time winking behind his hand to Mr. Cutly-a nman with black eyes and a face full of low cunning-- then turning to his wife, and winking to her also, he said, "Lucind, do you know anything about them?" "Do n't ask me," she replied; "I 'll have noth- -ing to do with any such lies." "I1 do," said the man of low cunning; "they 'vo moved away. I saw them start." "Thank you! thank you!" exclaimed the oily- tongued man, bringing his hand down; with torce on the other one's knee. "'You're the man for   238  ATHE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. me! I could n't have suited myself better in an answer. You always know what to say, and jest when to say it," Greeta burst into tears. Her cup of happiness was dashed to the ground. She had taken all this; long walk and got the headache for nothing. Oh, if she had only listened to Mrs. Parsons, and waited till Mr.- Nate could come with her. "Oh, do n't cry!" said Mr. Travus, his tongue having suddenly received an unusual accession of oil; "was Mrs. Oartmor any relation of yours?" "Oh, no; only I wanted to live with her. She was going to make something of me." "Make something of you? Bless my soul,! you just stay here with us, we'll make something of you. I dare say you've heard of us. Have n't you ever heard of Travus, the greatest bread and cracker maker in the State? My wife--Lucind there-can learn you to appear in any company.

She can learn you to sew and do all kinds of work, and when you want to go out into company she can lend you silks and   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    2389 merinos to dress in. You have a black silk and a green mering, have n't you, Lucind?" "Yes,"' in a tone that implied no thanks to you, though. "Yes, she has; and when you want to go out into company you shall wear 'em. Come, lay down your things and stay; you're just the girl we want and 've been looking for, far and near." "I know she's smart. I liked her the ve?,y first glimpse I had of her," said the man of low cun- ning. "What do you say to laying down your things and flying round and washing them dishes, and let us see how smart you are?" resumed the man of the oily tongue. "Come!" The last was said in a tone that was more per- emptory than oily, and so startled Greeta that, without farther delay, she rose and proceeded, as directed by Mrs. Travus, to remove a pile of dirty dishes from a table, which stood in the middle of the floor, to one side of the stove hearth; and, after washing them in a kettle of hot water that stood on the stove, placed them in a pile on the other side. The stooping posture and heat of the stove not only increased her headache, but made her dizzy. Just as she was thinking, "'Oh, if I had only listened to Mrs. Parsons!"-"That's the   240  THE D IKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. talk!"; exclaimed the oily-tongued man. "She's not afraid of spoiling her hands by putting them into hot water." "Nor of burning her face "-as he saw how red she was--chimed the man of low cunning, giving her cheek a pinch. "She'll make a jam-up wife one of these days"-said and done in a manner which roused Greeta, who, usually gentle, could also hl violent when tried beyond certain bounds. This man had gone too far, and she turned on him a look that made. him quail. It was not altogether a look of reproof and menace, but of a superior human soul rising up in the grandeur of its inno- cence, and passing sentence on an inferior and heinously guilty and presuming one; and, taking up the dishes, she carried them to the table, and, with her back to the company, began wiping them. "Gods! such a look as that from a child! Did you see it?" exclaimed the mtanl of low cunlling, after partially recovering from the stunning blow of the look. "No, not fully; what was it?" "It was such a look as the devil himself might have given. I believe she is a devil. I should like to bring her proud looks down a little. She would n't be the first one I 've humbled."   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    241 "You'll not do it about my house, sir!" said 'Mrs. Travus, who in a flash of indignation, flew in a pet out of the room, muttering, "Poor little innocent thing!" as she passed Greeta. "I tell you, Cutly, 'tain't best to say much on sich pints before Lucind. She's peculiar on them pints. I generally liave my own way, but on these pints she's onmanageable, and I find that the safest way is jest to knuckle to her." "I'm glad I have n't a wife to knuckle to," mut- tered the man of low cunning, taking his hat and sulkily stalking out to the bakery. "You're right, Lucind, perfectly right. I'm glad to see you stick up for your sect. I'm proud to think I have a wife that ain't afraid to stick up for the right," said Mr. Travus, as his wife re-entered the room. "Stick to it, and say and do what you please, little woman," he continued, slipping his arm around her waist, the oil fairly oozing out of his mouth, "only do try and not offend that fellow, for if he should take a fit to leave I do n't know what I should do, for it would be impossible to fill his place." "No, it wouldn't be impossible 'to fill his place either. Old Wilder would be glad to come, and I'm sure he's a better baker any day than ever Cutly was." "But he's such a drunkard there's no depending  N   242   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. on him," replied the oily-tongued man? slipping be- hind a curtain that shut out a little recess frorh the rest of the room, and was soon in bed. The lkicking, crying baby, put into Greeta's arms as soon as the dishes were completed, was not long in ascertaining, that though very fond of children, she was utterly incapable of amusing them, and made such loud demonstrations of his decided dissat- isfaction that his mother was glad to take him again. "I guess you may empty the water out of them tubs now, if you want anything else to do, while I git him to sleep," said Mrs. Travus, referring to two or three tubs full of suds and rinsing water left since the washing dbne two or three days before. "You' may dip the water out into that bucket with the wash-basin, and carry it of' a good ways from the house and throw it on the ground." Bucketful after bucketful did Greeta carry forth, till the contents of the three tubs was fairly disposed of, and they and the benches on which they stood set outside of the door; by which time the baby was fast asleep and in . his cradle, and Mrs. Travus hav- ing suddelnly come to the conclusion to be very neat and orderly, now that she had help, bade Greeta to sweep and scrub the floor while she cleared out the cupboard-which stood in sad need of such atten- /    THE 'DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    243 tion-cut the meat, and washed the potatoes for breakfast. As Greeta gave the finishing touch to the floor, Mrs. Travus remarked, "I guess the fire's down by this time so't you can clear the ashes out of the stove, and then you can put in kindling and wood all ready to touch a match to it in the morning." This done, Greeta was shown into the front room, the carpetless floor of which, was all littered with straw and feathers. At each of the two windows hung a tattered paper curtain, partially rolled up and tied with a string. There were four or five chairs in the room, no one of which possessed a whole bot- tom, besides two unsightly unmade beds, and a brass candlestick literally covered with tallow that was positively green from having lain so long on the brass. In this candlestick was a stump of a candle, which Mrs. Travus-lit, and said, "After making the beds you can get into this one with the blue cover- let. It is my mother's; you will sleep with her. She will be here pretty soon; she has just gone out ito one of the neighbors. You need n't be afraid of the men that sleep in the other bed; they are honest 'stone masons.' Cutly never sleeps in the house; he sleeps in the bakery," and so saying Mrs. Travus' left the room. ,   244   THE DUKE S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. CHAPTER XVI. OTHER says, Greet wants to leave," said Mrs. Travus querulously to her husband, one night as they two sat talking by the stove previous to re- tiring to rest. "I'll warrant," responded Mr. Travus, in a tone which gave unmistakable evidence 6f the oil's being quite worn off of his tongue. "It's no more'n I ex- pected, though. It's jest the way with all these hired girls. By the time't you get'em spruced up a little and teached all how you want'em to do things, they're ready to run off somewhere else." "The dear knows poor Greet' has n't spruced up much, for she has n't had anything to spruce up with since she has been here." "She never did have much since I knew her," said he, with a sneer. "Well, Mr. Travus, if she had little when she came here she has still less now. Here she's been, five or six months, and not a rag bought for her. The few old duds she had when she came here are just ready to drop off of. her. She hasn't a stockin' to her   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.   245 foot, nor any shoes but some old things't I threw away and that are so-large for her't she can hardly keep 'em on her feet. It's them't gives her such a shufflin' gait when she walks." "But what makes her want to leave? What's up all of a sudden'?" "She wants to go where she can earn somethin' to keep her from goin' naked! That's what's up; who wouldn't want to go if they was her?" "But can't you fix up some of your old clothes for her?" "I have to wear my old clothes myself. I have n't anything else to wear." "Well, but them old barrages and lawns't you used to wear't you don't any more? Won't they do?" "I would n't talk like a fool, Travus! Barrages and lawns for such weather as this, and to do such work as she has to do in! I'd talk some sense if I was in your place, or not talk at all!" "Well, what will do, if they won't?" "Tow-cloth, rather than barrages and lawns. She wants some good, strong calico dresses 't won't tear every time she moves." "Well, I expect I shall have to shell out enough to git her a dress or two. Is she pretty good to work?"   246  THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Good? You know she is. She saves us a dol- lar and a half a week't we'd have to pay a big girl if we had n't her." "Well, how much'll a calico dress cost? I ex- pect she 'll have to have one." - "Ten cents or a shillil' will buy very good calico." "Well, here 's fifty cents; and if that ain't enough tell Seymore't's for a poor orphan 't we 're a tryin' to clothe up, and perhaps he'll throw in a little. And, when you bring it home, make her think it cost an awful big price; tell her't things has ris' beyond all account lately, and then, you know, she 'll .be more likely to be satisfied with a little." "If you have any lyin'- to do, do it yourself! Don't ask me to do it." "Very well, leave it to me; I can say whatever is necessary. For my part, I don't think the truth is always to be spoken." "I do. But that ain't all-she wants to go to school." "To school? Thunder and lightnin'! A girl of her cloth, and her brains, talk about goin' to school! Why, she ain't half-witted, is she?" "I don't know. I never could tell much about her, but mother thinks she is a very bright child." "Bright? Why, our little Will here has more   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESC'APE.   247 wit in his little finger than she has in her whole body. Why, do you suppose a girl of common sense could live here as long as she has and not find out't Gartmors lived in the place?" "That's nothin' to the purpose. She 's an hon- est child, and believes everything that is told her; and then you know as well as I do that every pains has been taken to keep her from knowin' any one't could tell her about the Gartmors." "Honest? I know she's honest; but that's one evidence against her bein' smart, for smart folks are never honest. But she must be persuaded off the notion of goin' to school; that never 'll do, for you can't possibly spare her nohow, as I see." "I know I can't spare her, but there's no use of tryin' to persuade her off the notion of it, for mother and me's both tried. We've told her all such a girl as she need think of was to do all kinds of work, so to command the highest wages as a hired girl, but it only made her mad; she turned as red as a beet, and said she didn't want to be a hired girl." "Gittin' above her business, eh? Well, leave her to me; I 'll manage her!" said the oily-tongued man, snuggling down in bed to dream out some method of again deceiving poor little Greeta. "I 'll tell you what, Lucind," said he, a few min-   -248  0TfE' DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. utes after, "I 've jest thought. Hopkins was 'round  here to day to see me about gittin' up cakes and pies for a dance't they 're-goin' to have. Hie says 't they 're goill' to -start a dancin' school, and he and Cutly is to be the principal managers of it. Now, why would n't it be a good plan to have Greet go to that instid of any other school? You know they only meet once a week, and do n't go till four in the afternoon; you could spare her to go there well enough, couldn't you? Make her do up all the work before she starts-" "I do-n't know as she ll want to go to dancin' Bchool." "Oh, she'll never know the difference; tell her't's the way they do at all schools, and she'll be jest fool enough to believe it. She's never ben to school, has she?" "I do n't' know whether she has or not; she can read." "Well, then she.'s ben; for such a fool never'd learn anything out of school. That's the great evil of this country, teachin' everything that can walk to read, and makin' 'em feel above their con- dition. But if she makes any fuss, and says't she's ben to school and this ain't the kind she wants to go to, tell' her't, this is a new improvement-that the others have all gone out of fashion.

"Well, I guess I had better leave it to you, for I ain't quite so used to lyin' as you are. But what's she goin' to wear? She'll have to have something if she goes to dancin' school, among all them stuck up boys and girls." "Where's your black silk and green merino? Why can 't she wear them?" "Oh, you need n't be always talking about my black silk and g:een merino! Do you suppose I want everybody to wear 'e, and to every place? Anld besides, how's such a little thing ever goin' to wear my dresses? Why just the waist would come almost to the feet, and would u't begin to touch her, and the sleeves are twice too long for her!' "Well, you can tuck up the sleeves and skirt, can't you? Come, little woman," sleeking his tongue down as much as possible, "you fix 'em up for lher; she'll not go long, mark nly words for that! I' l give Cutly the wink-he hates her like poison--to manage it so 't she 'll be sick enough of school after a time or two, and if they get injured, I 'll take the money we 'd have to pay to a large girl, and buy tyou two new silks!

You can't change us no more 'n you can change the nater of a woman." "I don't believe she'll go with Cutly if he comes for her." "Never you borry any trouble about that!

It was evening twilight after a hot day. How refreshing is the cool breath of the sea to that excited gay group gathered on the quar- ter deck; and how grateful and soothing to the care-worn brow of that gentleman off there by him- self, at the farther side of the deck. As he stood with his arms folded, looking now at the clear, calm heavens, and then off on the sublime, rolling deep, some of the fair ones were just remarking on his majestic figure and royal bearing, when a reverend father in, a black gown made his appearance on deck, and, after touching his hat and bowing low to the gay company, passed on toward the gentleman in question, but who was so completely lost in thought as to be wholly unconscious of the presence of any second party, until the priest finally broke the silence by saying, "The Duke of Groveland, I :alieve!" ( The samel" said the gentleman, extending his   252  ,E D UKKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. hand in the most friendly manner possible; and con- tinued, "If it were not for this gown, I should say Lord Ransler stood before me." "Call me Father Ransler," said the priest signifi- cantly.           , The duke thinking it all a trick of his foxy young friend, Lord Raiisler, looked comically; and as they took seats, remarked, "I was not aware, Father Ransler, that you contemplated taking orders." "Then your grace had never heard that old Lord Ransler, of Belfast, was a rigid Catholic, and had his son educated for the priesthood?" g No0. "( Well, it is even so; but knowing myself wholly unfit for so holy an office, I never could persuade myself to be so hypocritical as to assume the gown, until now I have taken it into my head to try to pay the devil back in his own coin.'" "Ah!" said the duke, bestowing a quick, sharp look of inquiry. "( The truth is, I have a scheme on foot, and have come to entreat your grace to join me. It is a scheme in which your grace's most vital happiness is deeply concerned." And then followed a long, low, and very earnest i  , *   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    253 conversation, the nature of which the reader will gather by piecemeal. "I should be likely to know the little girl; but your grace would be the most likely to recognize the mothler." "Oh, that face, that form! Can I ever forget them!" exclaimed the duke, rising from his seat. "But your grace must not expect to find her looking just as she used to; her hair is now blanched, and her face thin and marked with lines of sorrow and suffering." "But I shall know the voice, the sweetest that man ever listened to!" "The voice, though weakened and saddened, is still beautiful. Your grace woould probably know it." Here their conversation again assumed so low a key as not to be heard by a third party. Whatever the scheme was, and whatever might have been the duke's objections to it, the reverend father had, be- fore the close of the voyage, succeeded so entirely in winning him over to his way of thinking on the subject, that when they parted in Liverpool their next meeting was to be in Rome.   254  ZTE DUKES WONDEIFUL ESCAPE. CHAPTER XVIII. HE Convent of the Sacred Name was situated in a most delightful spot, on the right bank of a noble'river in America. Its grounds were in- deed ample, five hundred acres of land having been donated to it by its pious founder. Its extensive buildings were of the nicest material and finish; and it was a new institution, not ten years having elapsed since the laying of its corner-stone. It was new, and therefore not as corrupt as an older insti- tution might have been. Many of the sisters were among the best of women. At the time of which we speak, it was in a flourishing condition, and just on the eve of making its annual retreat. The re- treat is an observance in this convent, in which the sisters-for the space of a number of days or weeks- do not allow themselves to speak to any one, but give themselves wholly to prayer and to receiving religious instruction from some one of the Jesuit fathers. It was to commence at six o'clock in the evening, and, in this instance, to continue two weeks. The minute the great bell tolled for it to   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    255 begin, every voice was hushed; and the groups of sisters, gathered here and there, in the halls, vesti- bule, and grounds, immediately dispersed to the sub- terranean chapel, to receive spiritual instruction. Not a voice was heard from any sister, save now and then, when they chanted their prayers, "Have mercy on us, have mercy on us," etc., in a tone so piteous and so beseeching as to impress all listeners with a feeling of unwonted solemnity. Doubtless the whole soul of the majority of those poor sisters came out in these heart-rending tones. The por- tress and two or three cooks, who were excused from making the retreat, in order that- they might wait on the Protestant boarders who were there spending the summer, walked softly and spoke in whispers. For two long weeks did those sisters move about like so many statues, without ears, eyes, or speech. If you chanced to meet one of them in hall or grounds she saw you not. If you ventured to speak to her she crossed herself, moved her lips in prayer, and passed on without seeming to notice you. They were often to be seen in the grounds; but each sat or walked apart from the rest, and seemed intent on reading her prayers. Such a change, from the usual busy hum and ap- parently chastened cheerfulness, so affected one poor Protestant lady, who loved gayety, that she declared *l .              .   256   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. she must leave-she couldn't possibly stand such gloom. But the two weeks ended at last; and now there was to be a gala day. The twenty sisters, who were to take either the black veil or the ring as soon as the bishop returned from Rome, were instructed to continue the retreat until he arrived, which would be in the course of one or two weeks. And now for the gala day. first of all, the greetings of the sisters to each other. Two weeks'silence made them feel as if they had been absent from home. Then high mass in the chapel, after which some choice music by the sisters and some of the reverend fathers and Jesuit broth- ers. Then a sumptuous repast, in the great parlor, for the priests and visitors-the sisters never eat with priests or any but sisters unless they happen to be traveling, when they are sometimes, obliged to. Meanwhile there are crowds of visitors going and coming, either parents or other friends of the sisters, who have been deferring their visit till after the re- treat, or strangers who, wishing to place their daugh- ters in the school, desire to be shown over the -con- vent. ' The poor parlor nuns are kept busy the whole day, scarcely taking time to eat; and the portress-   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    25T who thinks of her, and of how tired she must be, going to the door so often? She has consumption; and though pale, thin, and weary, she is quiet and pa- tient, for she expects soon to be laid beneath the subterranean chapel beside the other sisters that have died since the convent was founded. They died of consumption. Most of the sisters die of consumption, and very young. It is seldon that any of them in this convent live to be over thirty. As one of the mother superiors sat on the eastern portico, in close conversation with a reverend father, a traveling agent from Rome, who happened to ar- rive on the evening before this day of rejoicing, the portress approached and informed her that an old gentleman and lady wished to see Sister Xavier. "Oh, those old Quakers again!" exclaimed the abbess, throwing up her little white hands in the prettiest manner possible. "This is the third time that they have called within the last six weeks, and have been put off with the promise that they should see her as soon as the retreat was over. What shall I tell them?" "Why not let them see her?" asked the reverend agent. "Her retreat is not over. She is one of those who take the ring, and it is thought best that they con-   258   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. tinue their retreat until Bishop Dill comes, which you, father, say will be in two weeks." 'Yes; both he and Archbishop Athng may be expected about that time. They may be delayed a little, and they may start somewhat sooner; but one of thoem at least, and very likely both, will be here not far from that time." "But these old people, how can I face them again and tell them that they can not see her yet? They are such a decent old couple and seem so thoughtful, how can I face theri?" "Why not let them see her? What will be the harm?" "It would be impossible, father; for according to our rules no sister can either see company or speak- to any one during retreat unless especially excused by the bishop or her father-confessor." "Well; where is. her father confessor? Who is he? Can't he give her permission?" "Father Lanoy is our confessor; but he will not excuse her of all others." "Why not?" "Because we do not think her a true Catholic, to tell the truth, father?" "Then why is she here?" "That is a secret known only to ,the- bishop; and whenever we complain of her saying that she do n't   THE D UKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.     259 want to go to confession, or pray to the saints or the Blessed Virgin, and that she do n't believe the pope or any other human being has power to forgive sins, he exhorts us to patience, and says that if we can only contrive to keep her the church will be greatly enriched, and that if we pray enough she will in time get over all these heretical notions, and espe- cially after she takes the ring; and we know that if she sees these old people she Will never take the ring, and the church will thus lose a great dower." i "She's an heiress then?" ",I do not know as she's an heiress, but I know that we shall get money as long as we keep hel." "Let me see these old people," said the reverend agent gallantly. "I can say anything that is neces- sary;" and as he strode away with the portress he evidently took a deeper interest in the matter than just to relieve the abbess. "You wish to see Sister Xavier?" he said to the old people as he entered the parlor. "We wish to see Annie Campbell," said Thomas. The father looked after the retreating portress, who informed him that Annie Campbell was Sister Xavier's secular name. "I am sorry to disappoint you; but it seems to be the rule of this house that no sister can see visitors         .      .   260  TIME DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. or even speak to any one during her retreat," said the priest. "But the superior told us that the retreat would be over to-day," said Mary. "The retreat for the convent generally is over; but those who take the black veil and the ring, it seems, are to continue in retreat -until the bishop gets back, which will not be much before two weeks. He was expected to-day, but as the term of his stay was extended two weeks her retreat will have to last that much longer." "We shall never see Annie again, Thomas," said Mary solemnly. "It seems so," responded Thomas; and then added, "She seems to have escaped from the jaws of a wolf only to be taken by a dragon. ]But, Mary, that Eye that never slumbers will watch over her." "Is she your daughter," asked the priest. "Oh, no!" said Mary; " she has no parents or true friends. She's a poor, hunted lamb, but ] know the Good Shepherd will watch over her " "She seems to be wealthy?" "Oh, no, she *s not wealthy; we gave her a home with us, and just as she began to recruit a little, somebody persuaded her to come here to get an education, so that she could support herself and be independent. That was seven years ago, and   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    261 though we have written and called a great many times, we have neither seen nor heard anything of her. Poor child!" said Mary, wiping her eyes. The priest wiped his eyes also, and asked Thomas for his name. "Thomas Goodheart," was the reply. "And address?" It was given. "Now," said the priest, shalking hands with them most warmly and sympathetically, "if you do not hear from me before, you can call here two weeks from to-day, and I think you will either see Sister Xavier, or hear something satisfactory regarding her." "We want to see her before she takes the ring," said Thomas. "Just so!" said the priest. "I want you should see her before that takes place." And he spoke with so much interest, and with so much signifi- cance, that both Thomas and Mary looked up in- voluntarily, to see if they were not talking to some friend instead of a priest. ,c You may trust me!." he added, in an under- tone, as they took their departure. "I can tell thee what it is, Mary, thee may mark my words, that man is not a priest!"   DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "Think not, Thomas? He was dress'ed like one." "He was dressed like one, I grant thee; but has thee never read of wolves in sheep's clothing] This time we have a sheep in wolf's clothing." "I hope thee is right, Thomas, forAnnie's sake." "It may be; Mary, that God will see fit to rescue her at the last minute, just as in the case of faithful Abraham, who was saved from slaying his son. The knife, remember, was already raised, when, lo! a ram caught in the bush!" "Oh, Thomas! Thomas! let us pray mightily unto Him who alone can rescue her!" said Mary, and thus the two journeyed on. "How did you manage?" asked the abbess, as the reverend agent re-appeared on the portico. "It was pretty hard work, but I got them off' at last by telling them to call two weeks from to-day. Was that right? It will all be over by that time, will it not?" "I hope so; for indeed, father, we have had our own times and troubles with this Sister Xavier, she ll the time warring with our holy Mother Church, and the bishop, meantime, urging us to do all in )ur power to detain her." "It is strange that, so much at variance with our aoly religion, she has not broken away from us en-   tirely before this time, though, I suppose, she must be very youthful?" "Youthful? No!" with   a sneer, "she's at least thirty-five. Why, she's the mother of three children, and the only thing that keeps her here, or makes her profess the Catholic faith at all, is the solemn promise of the holy bishop and father con- fessors, that her children shall be produced as soon as she becomes a good Catholic." "Are they in the convent?" with an interest that greatly puzzled the abbess. "No; but the bishop has given her to understand that he knows where they are." "Does he?" with the same unaccountable in- terest. "No; or, at least, I think not. He instituted a. search for them before he went to Rome, but I think no trace was found of them. You have no idea what a rigid Protestant she is; there is no con- vincing her. And she's very intelligent on the subject, too. All my arguments are as nothing be- fore her; she deals with them as though they were cobwebs. There she is now. out there in the grounds." The priest gave a terrible start, at which the ab- bess laughed heartily,' saying, "Do n't be afraid, father, she s perfectly harmless if she is a heretic;"    264   THE DUIE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. and continued, "She has her prayer book open, but I have no idea that she is reading prayers. She's more likely contriving some plan for getting rid of taking the ring now at the last moment. We have to watch her continually, and it is such a task!" ,' I expect you'll change your manner toward her when you get her wholly into your power?" "I shouldn't wonder. But go from us she never can!" bringing the little white hands together With energy. Father Lanoy now made his appearance, com- plained of a severe headache, and begged the rev- erend father, the agent, to officiate in his place at vespers, and sit in the confessional. The real rea- son was, this was Father Lanoy's birthday, and his housekeeper was making grand preparations to celebrate it, and he wished to spend the evening at home. The reverend agent was entirely willing to grant the favor. During all this conversation between the rever- end agent and the holy mother superior, Sister Xavier was walking in the grounds, engaged in earnest prayer directed to the right source., She had her prayer book in her hand to be sure, but it was bottom side up, purposely so, that her mind need not be distracted. She knew she was watched,   THE DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    265 but she knew also that there was but one Ear that could hear her prayer. "( To Thee and Thee only do I pray, dear Heav- enly Father, and not to my fellow-servants the saints; not to angels; not to the Virgin Mary, nor yet to the pope, or any priest; to Thee alone do I make my plea! Wilt Thou have mercy upon me? Wilt Thou be pleased! to save my children? Wilt Thou restore my children to their sorrowing mother? Oh, if it be consistent with Thy holy' will, wilt Thou restore them? But oh, if Thou hast other- wise determined, enable me to say, ' Thy will be done,? and give me strength to refuse the cup that Rome holds so persistently to my lips! Oh, I be- seech Thee, suffer me not to perjure my soul, even to save my children. Oh, Righteous Father, may I put all my trust in Thee, for Thou only canst save. Oh, give me faith, even as faithful Abraham. Enable me to 'hope against hope.' May I have strength to do right, and to believe that Thou canst provide a way of escape at the last moment, even as Thou didst in the case of Abraham." Sister Xavier's mind was now made up, and, trusting the consequences to the Savior, she went to confession that night with the solemn intention of telling Father Lanoy that she could not take the ring. -         1    266  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. "I am not your confessor," said the reverend agent. Sister Xavier started when she saw her mis- take. "But," continued he, "I sit in his place, and will give you the best advice in mypower. In the first place, daughter, I am glad, for one, that you have come to this conclusion; for we do not want any one in our hloly Mother Church who does not come willingly and subscribe fully to all her blessed teach- ings and doctrines. Most especially do we object to the presence of heretics here among the lambs of the Sacred Name. And now, to avoid all trouble to yourself, and to the holy sisters who have charge of you, continue your retreat until Bishop Dill or Archbishop Athng returns from Rome. Say noth- ing more of your intention not to take the ring; but when the hour arrives put this on your finger, and present yourself with the other candidates." So saying, he put into her hand a diamond ring, and said, "When the archbishop sees this, he will have no more to say about the church ring." To the mother superior he said, "I have spoken with this reprobate Sister Xavier on the subject of taking her last vows. After hearing my views in the case she seemed quite resigned, and assured me that she would present herself with the other candi- dates for the ring; and I would advise that the   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    267 matter rest. Too much said might make her change ,her mind again; the less said the better." The'next morning the reverend agent was far on his way toward a distant city. When news at last came that the ship with the bishop on board would pass up the river past the convent in a few minutes, all the sisters and mothers assembled on the top of the convent; the great bell was tolled, and the sis-' ters waved their handkerchiefs, some of them ex- claiming, "There he is!" and others, "There is his flag, with the keys of Saint Peter!" During all this excitement about the bishop, Sister Xavier was entirely forgotten, and availed herself of this first opportunity, when not watched, of exam- ining the ring. "Oh, precious treasure!"  She pressed it to her lips; for oh, joy! joy! it was her own old ring, given to her in happier days by- well, never mind mentioning his name, for she had years before given him all up into the hands of her Savior; had long since ceased mentioning his name, and had tried to banish him from her thoughts. What happiness came to her with that ring, and what sorrow too; how she had loved the giver, but he had been very cruel to her. That loved image which she had once shrined so carefully and ten- derly in her heart had gradually assumed all the semblance of a venomous reptile that she would   26.8 o-AE  DUKES WONDERFUL ESCAPE. gladly forget. As the thought of how he had -trampled on all the rich:love of her young heart, and requited it by following her all these years with so much malice and torture, stood up before her, she cried out in agony, "Oh, fiend! Oh, cruel, cruel fiend!" -and wiping her lips, as though the touch of the ring had been pollution, she was about to cast it from her with indignation and disgust, when the sight of One standing by her, wearing a crown of thorns, and the thought that she had helped to plait the crown, arrested her hand; and when the wearer of the crown seemed to say, "Forgive as thou wouldst be forgiven!" she threw herself at his feet and said penitently, "Blessed Savior, not as I will, but as Thou wilt!"Then returning the ring to its hiding place, she resumed her walk in the grounds, wondering how the reverend father came by the ring, and who the reverend father could be. It cer-- tainly was the ring taken from her years before by a cruel monster. Late in the evening word came that the bishop had been detained in Rome; but that Archbishop Athng, who had just commenced a visiting tour to the dioceses of his various suffragans, would offi- ciate at the taking of the veil and ring, at eight o'clock the next morning, "Archbishop Athng." The sisters had heard of   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    269 , but neither they nor any of the reverend fathers had ever seen him. The bishop's parlor, which had been put in order during the afternoon, was re-arranged, re- ceiving some extra touches in honor of his grace the archbishop. The altar also, already prepared, received additional decorations. At half-past seven in the morning, the arch- bishop, attended by a goodly art-ay of father confessors, was in the sacristy. Soon after word came from Colonel McDuffey, who with his regi- ment was stationed a few miles from the convent, stating that never having witnessed the ceremony of taking the veil, if agreeable to the lady su- perior, he with some of his men would like to be present this morning. The matter was referred to the archbisliop, who signified his entire willing- ness. Accordingly the .colonel and one of his comlpanies filed into the chapel. At the first low note of the organ, the sisters who were to take part in the ceremonies marched in; at the right of each walked a young girl dressed as a bride's maid, and carrying a lighted wax candle. Soon after the entrance of the arch- bishop, arrayed in his pontificals and attended by the priests, there was a stir in the audience. Some one had fainted. It was Sister XavierI   270  THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE. The archbishop followed her with his eyes as she was being borne out by four sisters. He turned very pale and his voice faltered. During her ab- sence he glanced frequently toward the door, and seemed quite disconcerted. They all thought,- 4' What a kind-hearted man!"When she returned his-eyes wandered continually to where she sat. When it came her turn and- she put out her hand, lo and behold! the finger that was to re- ceive the gold ring was already-encircled by a flashing diamond! The archbishop was deeply moved and speech- less. The abbess reached out her hand to take off the ring, but his grace anticipated her; and, taking it in his own hand, examined the inside, and, fixing on poor, trembling Sister Xavier a look of ineffable tenderness, he pronounced a name which she alone understood, and opened his arms. She rushed into them! All were amazed, while the archbishop, utterly regardless of anything save the being he held in his arms, stood pressing her to his heart. Colonel McDuffey now stepped forth and said, "Ladies and gentlemen, behold the Duke and Duchess of Groveland!'  Then speaking to his men, they escorted the rejoicing pair to the car- riage.   THE DUKE'S WONDERFUL ESCAPE.    271 The sisters and priests, having recovered from their first shock, pressed around the carriage; offering their congratulations, and begged them to remain for refreshments. But the duchess, nes ling closer into her husband's arms, positively refused, and the duke, not willing ever again to relinquish his precious burden, also declined; and the colonel escorted them to the ship, where they found Thomas and Mary awaiting them, and where they were soon after joined by the reverend agent from Rome, who proved to be no other than their friend Lord Ransler. At six o'clock, as they sailed out of the bay, they met the ship on board of which was the veritable Bishop Dill, and who, as he saluted the duke with profound reverence, had no thought that the little lady, dressed in a full suit of Quaker costume-the parting gift of Mary and Thomas- leaning on his grace's arm, was Sister Xavier, his fugitive prey.
