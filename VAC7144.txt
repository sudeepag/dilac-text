TO PATRICK DONAHOE, ESQ., WHO, DURING A LONG AND HONORABLE CAREER, HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN PROPAGATING AMONG HS COUNTRYMEN IN AMERICA AN ABIDING LOVE OF FAITH AND FATHERLAND: This Volume, is Respectfully Dedicated BY THE AUTHOR.     PREFACE. A STORY OF IRELAND. That is all this volume pretends to be; it is written of a period when thousands of Irish hearts were warmed with visions of liberty, and, when that liberty seemed possible of attainment. 1 NINETr - EIGHT." The year when the men of Ulster, and Wexford, and other parts of Ireland, chose rather to meet their Eng- lish foes upon the battle-field, than remain quiescent bondmen under the rule of a foreign power. Such a period has a charm still for the men of Ireland. They can look back upon it and find little, if anything, to con- demn, so far as concerns those who took an active part in that memorable struggle-much to lament and stig- matize as concerned the English soldiery, and Irish yeo- manry-the latter, as alien in their instincts, and as de- void of mercy to those within their power as the most ruthless hordes that ever cursed our Sacred Isle. It were easy to have written a Tale of this kind, full of sensation and sentiment; but, the author chose to delineate his characters, as they really existed; to show the spirit that actuated them in their different spheres, and to adhere strictly to such a description instead of following the beaten path, and dwelling magniloquently' on fancies of the imagination, gathered from a few inci- dents of the time of which he treats. The facts related in this Story will be readily recognized by many who are acquainted with the local history, or traditions of the places mentioned. To those unacquainted with such 5   Vi         PREFACE. topography, the general description will be sufficient to keep before the reader's mind all that is necessary in properly understanding the main drift of our story. The aim of the author, in the following pages, has been simply to direct the mind of the reader through the pleasing channel of narrative to the knowledge of a few things connected with the Rebellion of Ninety-Eight, in the North of Ireland. It is well known, that the mass of our people retain historical facts received in this man- ner, with greater tenacity than when presented to them in the dry order of chronology. He also intended to foster among his countrymen, a continued love of those who dared everything for their dear country,-believing that the spirit thus created eventuates in the propaga- tion of those opinions which precede a Nation's Resur- rection. He would instil into the heart of every Irish- man who is cold to the interests of the land of his birth, a living faith and an ardent devotion towards that Land. To those who require no incentive to such faith and de- votion--nd thank Heaven, they are the majority-lhe would inspire with a hope that must never be extin guished but in death--that a day must come when Ire- land, freed from the unholy alliance of English connec- tion, shall stand forth arrayed in the glorious panoply of liberty. Such sentiments as these may, by some, be con- sidered unbecoming-and it is possible that their ex- pression may militate in some way against the success of this volume-but, after all, it is better to boldly run one's flag on high, that friend and foe may gaze upon it in the light. EXCELSIOR! It opens its folds to the breeze, and see, its color is- OUR OWN IMMORTAL GREEN." THE AUTHOR. NEW YORK, May, 1869.   INTRODIUCTION. "Who fears to speak of Ninety-Eight? Who blushes at the name? When cowards mock the patriot's fate, Who hangs his head for shame? -e's all a knave or half a slave, Who slights his country thus; But a true man, like you, man, Will fill your glass with us." THREESCORE years and ten have rolled away into the abyss of time, carrying with them joys and sorrows, dan- gers and difficulties, passions and perturbations, hopes disappointed, and hopes realized, crowns and dynasties raised, while others have fallen, since the memorable year of NINETY-EIGHT in Ireland--a year when the daring sons of Uladh, and brave old Wexford, rushed to arms in order to restore the lost independence of their beloved country. These were stirring times. America, then an infant Republic, just new from her bloody swaddling clothes, stood forth before the nations of the ld World, arrayed in all the glorious panoply of liberty. France, steeped in blood and crime, lay sweltering and panting after her terrible excesses; her ancient noblesse killed or banished, while the giant mind of a young Caesar was engaged in moulding the future destinies of that powerful nation. IRRBT Aw --ervent and holy Ireland-with the yearn- ing aspirations for freedom still gnawing at her heart,   Viii       INTRODUCTION. with the memories of long centuries of terrible persecu- tions still green and fresh before her, with the sweet taste of liberty yet hanging on her lips-seemed calling on her sons to join in the strife of nations, and rescue their motherland from the hard and tenacious gripe of the stranger. Such was Ireland in the terrible year of  NINETY- EIGHT! There are those still living who can recall to mind the yet unwritten stories of the barbarism of the English soldiery and Irish yeomanry of that period. There are others whose fathers and mothers were eye-witnesses of strange scenes, sufferers in the " troublous times," who have listened to the recital of deeds that sicken the heart to dwell on, and heard with rapture the tales of gallant and heroic daring, when our kindred chose the bloody arbitrament of war, rather than live to possess a country degraded and enslaved for the benefit of an- other. So comes the history of Nations. Song and Story hand down to posterity that which dare not be written at the time of its occurrence; with hushed voice and bated breath, the horrors of NINETY-EIGtT were repeated by the turf fire on a winter's evening. A strange and powerful fascination possessed all, as those who spoke exhibited the marks of what they suffered. "I remem- ber it well," said an elderly matron. "Our house stood within forty yards of the main road, near Aughagallon. 'Twas a Sunday afternoon, and none of us had been to Mass that day, in consequence of the vile conduct of the 'sogers? and Downshire's yeomanry towards those whom they met coming from chapel. A loud knock was heard at the door: it was opened, and in rushed twelve or four- teen of Mackenzie's black yeos. They wanted arms; at least they said so. Father's old rusty gun -was slung across the fire-place; one of them reached for it, and   INTRODUCTION.         ix as I happened to come against him, he struck me with the butt end of it, and I fell hands foremost into the fire. I was then only four years of age,-and see, I bear the marks of the burn on my hands to this day. Never shall I forget the awful curse of that brutal man as long as II live;" and the tears rolled down the cheeks of the speaker. There were those listening who are men now, and if the tear did not bedew their cheek, the words just quoted were seared as with fire into their brain. This may go some length in explaining the constantly recurring disaffection of Irishmen towards England Irishmen are incapable of loyalty to that country. They will not let it into their minds, except to be dwelt upon with feelings of satisfaction and thankfulness, that they never can, and never shall be, loyal to that power. I stay not to inquire whether they act rightly or wrongly in permitting themselves to be actuated by such feelings. I know my own in the matter, and probably so do most of my readers. My line of duty lies another way. I have got to chron- icle facts of men and times, of brave men and bad men, of stirring and eventful times, when creed and country were paramount in the minds of those who suffered much for both.   t r   CONTENTS, PAGE DEDICATION.          - P1'EFACE.

CHAPTER I. CHRMSTMAS DAY IN 1797. "And happy and bright are the groups that pass From their peaceful homes, for miles O'er fields and roads, and hills to Mass, When Christmas morning smiles!" GTLORIOUS Old Church I  How oftet is poor humanity soothed and blessed as it listens to the rapturous strains of exulting hosannas, alleluias, magnificats, litanies, and solemn  vesperal chants ! Al these, and many more such like, hast thou for ages used to raise man's heart to heaven, to quiet the spirit that has been tortured and racked by the world, to calm the passions of nature out  raged, or soothe the weary fluttering heart. But where, ^1: in all thy rich and glowing calendar, can we find aught: to equal the sweet and tender invitation of the Adeste Fideles, on a Christmas morning, in some silent nook of holy Ireland! Our story opens on Christmas morning, 1797. We take our stand for a little, on the rising ground of the main road leading beyond Randalstown, in the county Antrim,  north of Ireland. The snow lies thick 1   2    THnE IRISH WIDOW'S SON ; OR, upon the ground like one vast winding sheet. Icicles hang from the trees; like diamonds, they sparkle in the bright starlight. See-there are dark figures of people who cross over the fields noiselessly and hurriedly, i Not a footfall is' heard, although the silence of the grave reigns around. Yonder, amid a clump of fir trees, stands the humble chapel. We can discern the cross from here. See the aged people, wrapped and hooded, bending the lowly knee as they approach within sight of the emblem of salvation! The lights glisten through the frost-cov- ered panes. Come, we'll enter. What an humble spot; and yet there is life and warmth within. The walls are rough and whitewashed; the Altar and its surroundings plain and homely, clean and neat; no seats, no pews, as in the rich and splendid city temples- of to-day. Hollys and laurels, festooned in rustic fashion, adorn the holy place. And there is a band of choristers too, but no pealing organ to accompany them. Oh  how sweetly they sing Venite Adoremus; we join them in our hearts, and real- ize the mysteries of the Manger better perhaps for the poverty of the place. Mass begins, and the people bow themselves to the earth. One glance at them, and we feel'that they have' just emerged from the dreary days when penal laws for- bade them even such a place to worship in. The sun is breaking in the east; and, as the hands of the good old pastor, Father John McAuley, are raised to heaven to impart his holy benediction on his flock, a ray shoots forth upon the serene countenance of the holy mn, and imparts to his face something of the hidden glories and mysteries of the Altar at which hbe stands. Listen: LAUDATE NOMExN DOMNE, peals forth from the choristers, and, as the priest bends his knee for the last time at Mass, he slowly rises and stands buried in med- itation for a few moments. Again, he ascends the Altar steps. One-half of the congregation retires; the others   THE PTKTEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       3 remain, and soon again the little chapel is filled. Ite Missa est is again pronounced, and a third Mass com- mences, the chapel half emptying as before, and filling again as rapidly. Glorious morn I The sun is now well risen, and with it a sharp and bracing air that gives life and strength to the young, most of whom go cheerfully along, while the older people remain loitering about in the chapel yard, some to have a talk about the times, and others, chiefly old women, who, after exchanging kindly salutations of "a merry Christmas to you, and a happy new year," re- enter the chapel as if loth to leave the sacred spot. Many of these good people had a sort of foresight that they might never enjoy the happiness of another Christ- mas morning within its walls again. Most of them be- lieved that before another winter came round   they would be quietly gathered to the company of those who preceded them. Others thought, and with good reason too, that the dark cloud of persecution and suffering was gathering ominously around them, betokening ruin to them and theirs. Various were their thoughts and surmises, as the priest entered his humble abode which adjoined the chapel. "Won't you come in Mary," said one "old woman to another, "and take a breath of the file in Father'John's kitchen, before we start on the road?" "I'm just waiting for that same," said her companion; "but, poor man, ] wouldn't like to disturb him till he gets some breakfast." "Ah! that's true; I forgot. He's fasting, and was up the greater part of the night, and the night before, too." "What in the world would keep Father John out of bed for two  nights? Are any of the Dolans worse, did you hear?" "Well, some of them can't be much worse than they   4    '8THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, are. Phil. is better, I'm told, but Ned. andthe father are still confined to bed."  "That was an unlucky market day for them. May God -bless them and preserve them, poor fellows.' "To be sure, woman dear; but just the same luck might have happened to any of ourselves. Pat. Dolan was advised not to, go to Antrim, as there was a likelihood that some of Mackenzie's crew would be there, on pur- pose to raise a row because the Dolans went." "The Lord help us; but isn't it a sad thing that strangers in the country, who hate the look of every one of us, have it in their power to maim and injure folk, without the smallest chance- of punishment to them- selves." "Yes; and there is worse even than that. If we are known at all to be what we are, sure there's not one of us free from jibe or insult, go where we may. It was only the other morning I was going across Flanigan's field with a bit of butter and a grain of meal to old Molly, beside the hill, when a young brat of the Bryce's saw me, and called out, ' there's another of them papishes that we are going to string up some fine morning, for cursing the country with their beads and Mass books.' I never once turned round, but just passed on as if I had not heard a word uttered." "The very best thing you could do. Old Molly is im- proving, I hope?" ' Sure wasn't she at Mass this morning, thanks be to to God, and isn't she gone home with Mike Canavan and the -family to spend the day." "s And is this the way that Mary McQuillan and Nelly  McLeesh spend their morning, instead of coming in to see an old friend, and wish him many happy returns of the, season." Both speakers turned round, and there was Father John, with a hand outstretched to each, and wishing   THE PJIMEN OF NINETY-EIGO   T.   5 them good health, and many Christmases might they see. "The same to your reverence,"  curtseying. '          ' d Mrs. McQuil-an, curtseying. " s. t lIcLeesh and myself were going in to see Kate; but we just thought as you hadn't breakfasted that we would bide here a little." ' "Come away, come along," said Father John; "nor have I breakfasted yet; but do you think that the sight of one or other of you would taIe away a hungry man's appetite ? ot a bit of it," and the kindly old man rubbed his hands, chatting away as they entered. Father John's housekeeper was young Kate O'Neill, his niece, and an orphan besides. Her mother, the priest's sister, died when ate was merely a child. ther father was but lately dead, and since then the handsome girl appeared to be stricken with years, although she had not passed her twenty-second summer. Before her fa- ther's death, her uncle had prevailed upon her to come and make his house her home; she did so, and one year afterwards, her father was laid in the grave beside her mother eside her Kate had been at communion that morning, and Father John observing her kneel by the Altar steps, just as he was leaving the chapel, and guessing too that her thoughts were divided between the ]anger and the souls of her deceased parents, did not venture to disturb her. Presently she entered, and blushed to find that her uncle 'had been waiting. "Now, Kate, chld,' said Father John, "let us hurry. There are two of our friends come to see your old uncle, and to bid him all sorts of happiness for another twelve month, and what do you think but both of them were waiting outside till I had got my breakfast, just as if I were going to m ake a meal of them, I  suppose." Kate felt she had acted wrongly, but fell to with a will sand shortly produced a savory breakfast of ham, eggs,   6    THE IEISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, and tea, and all the other et ceteras of cream and butter, and home-made bread. The white linen diaper table- cloth, so invitingly spread out, the warm plates, and steaming cups of tea, made Father John anxious to begin. The two women were heartily invited to partake of breakfast, but declined. They wanted, as -they said, just to speak with Kate for a while, and, accordingly, Father John was left alone in his humble but comfortable parlor. "I wonder," he said to himself, "if Mrs. McLeesh has heard anything more about that rumor; she appears as if she had, and probably wants to learn from Kate if I have heard anything about it." What rumor did Father -John allude to?' Let us try if we can understand it. It was observable after last Mass that morning, that the male portion of the congregation did not remain only a few minutes -on the roadside, as was their wont; neither did they loiter in the precincts of a house of call kept by one Paddy Farren. It was also observable, that this same Paddy, a rough, but honest specimen of an Irishman, was absent at the very hour when he used to see his neighors who had come a long distance, and who enjoyed the comforts of his great fire- -side, where Paddy usually kept a good stock Of turf, to send a genial heat through the whole kiteken. What, was up? Something was going on, but what was that something, and what did it mean'? We shall find some explanation in the following chapter.   THE -PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       7 CA PTER II.

MCQxjTTLTA-^ and Mrs. McLeesh were sisters-in-law. .= They had known Kate O'Neill's mother and father from the time they were married; and either of these good women would have been happy to have taken care of Father McAuley's niece, if he had permitted them. Mrs. McLeesh was quite restless from the moment her son told her that, when passing by the priest's house, he observed him go round the chapel with a lantern in his hand, and closely examine all about it as if something lay concealed in its vicinity. This was enough to rouse her suspicions, for, she had heard it reported before, that the chapel was soon to be wrecked or burned by a party at-that time in the country, known by the name of Wreckers (Orangemen). She thought she was the only ond in possession of the secret, and endeavored to learn from her neighbor, Mrs. McQuillan, if she, or Miss O'Neill, knew of any danger. Finding that both were alike ignorant, she determined to keep the matter to her- self, lest the poor priest might come to hear of it. He must certainly have had some reasons for his minute ex- amination of the grounds around the chapel; but she hoped it had nothing to do with what she had heard.   s8   'I'fTHE IRISH WTIDOW S SON; OR, Thus it was in those days. The people trying to hide unpleasant rumors from the priest, and the latter trying to hide them from the people. "Kate?" "Coming:, uncle."' "This fire is getting low, child. Bring some turf, and let us have a cheery glow." Kate obeyed; and, knowing that the command to make up a new fire, meant also to come and sit at her uncle's knee,- was soon beside him. Laying his hand on the girl's head, Father John said: "How long is it, Kate, since mother died?" "You told me, uncle, it was nearly twenty years." "Twenty years. Aye, let me see-twenty and twenty, and -twenty-four. Thatfs right, Kate; I am over sixty- four years of age. Now, what will you be, child, when you are sixty-four?" -I hope to be in heaven long before that, dear uncle, and to be beside you, and father and mother." "What! and you would really like to die at an early age, and leave poor Cormac breaking his heart behind you. See here, now, my child," and the good old priest feigned a strength and spirit he did not possess. "Sup- pose that any one--always excepting Cormac, of course -came near this house to injure us; or, suppose any- thing to take place, such as any annoyance, I mean; wouldn't the strength of other times, girl, come back to this old arm, and make it just what it was forty years ago, when I beat the biggest McQuillan in the parish at every feat of strength he could invent." Kate looked up in her uncle's face, and saw thathe-was merely trying to divert her mind. "But would you really like to die, Kate, before your--" "Now, dear uncle," replied Kate, putting her soft white delicate hand upon his knee, "I know what you are go- ing to say, and I could laugh and enjoy all the good   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       9 stories about young Cormac, but to-day, uncle, to-day you know is doubly sacred to your poor Kate, the birth of my God, and- the death of my father. -I feel happy, dear uncle, in thinking how many Christmases are re- served for us all above. Father John saw with pleasure that his niece had as yet learned nothing of the evil rumors which were afloat around the whole country for some days past. iHe knew the inward nature of the sweet girl beside him, andonly dreaded that what appeared to be a sort of melancholy with her, was perhaps ,the result of fear, arising from what she might have heard. His pleasant banter about young Cormac Rogan was merely a ruse. Kate O'Neill was beautiful in person, and as pious as she was beautiful. It was seldom that her piety betrayed itself in outward actions, except when alone in her little oratory, before the dear image of her whom she had im- plored at an early age to be a mother to her. Hers was an inward piety, whereby her whole nature was regulated by the highest standard of virtue, and, although she be- lieved she was shrewd enough to conceal all this from the world, yet the actions of her soul werevisibly stamp- ed upon her face, and gave to her natural beauty, that supernatural charm   which the eye may witnpss, but which the tongue cannot describe. C0rmac Rogan was a  young farmer, about twenty-four years of age. His mother, who resided in the townland of Ballygrooly, lost her husband when Cormac was only seven years old, so that there was this in common be- tween himself and Kate O'Neill, they were orphans at nearly the same time. Widow Rogan's farm was poor and barren; but, with the help of a  couple of servants, known by the name of the   " two Mullans," the unfruitful soil was made to be sufficiently productive so as to keep all four in good cir- cum stances.   10   PTLE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, John and Peter Mullan were twins, and resembled each other very strongly. Oftentimes the neighbors found no small difficulty in distinguishing one from the other, and as not a few laughable incidents occurred in consequence of this resemblance, it was agreed on all sides that the pair should henceforth be known by the name of the two Mullans. I shall relate one instance that partly led to the adop- tion of this course. John Mullan was-known to be on rather " good terms " with a fine young woman named Bridget O'Hara. An appointment was made that each should see the other coming home from Antrim Fair; but, as John was busily engaged at out-door work on the morning of the ap- pointed day, his brother Peter was sent instead, not knowing that John was selected by Cormac's mother to perform that duty. On his way home he met Bridget, and gallantly asked her to take a seat beside him in the cart, as the roads were soft and damp. She at once con- sented, as this was part of the arrangement between her- self and John. To Peter's utter surprise, the girl began to banter him on being late, and quizzed him a good deal on that fact. He acknowledged that he was rather be- hind time, but laid the whole blame on Peggy Dolan and her father. "E And what has Peggy to do with you?" naively in- quired Bridget. "Faith, not much; only she beguiled the time while her father and I were taking a dram at McQuillan's counter before starting on the road." "Maybe it's fond of you she was getting," said Bridget. "Sure then I wish that that were the fact," said Peter, "for a pretty girl is this same Peggy." Bridget was glad that the darkness of the evening pre- vented her emotion being observed by her compan- ion. Peter wondered that she kept so quiet, and thought   ITHE PTKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      " that he had offended her in some way, little knowing, poor fellow, that he had indeed offended her, but in a manner he little dreamed of. Bridget's home lay up a loaning about forty perches from the roadside. When Peter assisted her to alight, he did so as gently as possible, and with a sort of quiver in his voice, bade her good-night; but Bridget never re- plied; she hurried onward lest he might hear the sobs she had tried to smother. Peter whistled an Irish air, and endeavored to forget the whole " bit of nonsense," as he termed it. After a little I while he said to himself: "Well, I took that girl to be a r totally different person from what she is.: I did tell Jack, more than once, that he was a happy fellow in having, such a wife in prospect. My goodness! how she did wonder when I mentioned Peggy Dolan's name. Phew I maybe she's in love with myself and is jealous of Peggy. 2 Tis a good joke; and I'll keep it to myself till some day when I want to annoy Jack about his sweetheart." Next evening when work was done, John Mullan thought he might just as well take a race over to the O'Hara's and see Bridget. In he dashed in his usual off- hand way; but the moment Bridget saw him, she arose with all the dignity she could command, and left the place. "That's too much of a good thing," saidlJack to him- self. "I came here on purpose to explain how it was I didn't get to the Fair, and kindly to inquire how she got home, and here she passes me by as if I were a Turk. Nothing like seeing a little temper when there's time to mend matters," thought Jack. After staying a short time he arose to leave; and, whether by accident or design on the part of Bridget, I cannot tell; but he met her " straight in the face " outside the door. It was but the work of an instant to take her by the hand, and throw his arm around her neck. i   12   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON    OR, "Let go my hand, John Mullan," said Bridget, imperi- ously. "Certainly," said John, and he did so. "I have been trying my best to believe that you weren't sober last night, in order to account for your conduct; but no matter how I strive, I cannot banish the convic- tion from my mind, that you were under the influence of drink." John Mullan stood there like a " dumbfounded ass," as he expressed it. He must have heard her--he was not deaf; but what did she say, or what could she mean? "Might H- " "Certainly not," said Bridget, in a decided tone. "Come, come," said John, assuming his former kindly attention towards the true-hearted girl; " there's a mis- take somewhere. You know I take no drink, Bridget, and, besides, I never left the house from four o'clock till Peter drove up to the door, when I went out to stable the horse." Bridget was quiet as the whole truth flashed upon her mind, and, flinging her arms tightly around her lover's neck, kissed him, then darted down the pathway that led from the house. John certainly had some reason to be nonplussed be- fore; but now he was in a sort of muddle, and began to question himself quite seriously as to whether he should ever have permitted himself to disbelieve in fairies and fairy lore. He followed the girl, but whatever took place at that interview was never made known. A duet of ringing laughter ahd a hearty "good-night," were- the only evidence of a reconciliation: thus John and Peter were called the " two Mullans," and not without some show of reason, either. "Kate," said Father John, " you are tired, child, and re- quire some rest, being up so early this morning. I think   THE PTWEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.        13 I'll accept that invitation of Mrs. Rogan's, and go dine there to-day. What if you accompany me? Old Nell can mind the house, and we will all spend a happy evening. Come, child, prepare." "Dear uncle, excuse me," said Kate. I am a little tired, and walking would not refresh me; and you know, Fath- er John "-she sometimes called him by that name, espec- ially in the presence of others--" the three old women, the blind man, and the two little boys are to be here to dine with me to-day, as it is Christmas." "But Mrs. McQuillan and Mrs. McLeesh will help Nell, and you won't be missed," said her uncle. KaLte persisted in remaining, saying,- "Take my kind regards to Mrs. Rogan, and tell her I'll be over to see her during the week, if the weather keeps fine. And be sure, uncle, to be back in time for tea, and I shall have it nice and hot for you." Father John gave a nod of his head, and bent his way towards the Rogans. --?..' '1 t    "   -THE IRISH WIDOW'So SON; OR, CtA PTER IIl. THE WRECKERS- CHAPEL BURNING    CORMAC ROGAE. "Yes, we have strength to make Irishmen free again; Only UNITE-and we'll conquer iour foe; And never on earth shall a foreigner see again, Erin a province-though lately so low." EARLY in 1794, there was established in several districts of the North of Ireland, especially in Armagh, Portadown, Dungannon, Banbridge, Antrim, Randalstown, Troon, Cookstown, and many other places, a society of men known by the name of "Wreckers," (in reality, Orange- men). A portion of this organized band of foreign con- spirators extended southwards, and even to this day, their deeds of violence and bloodshed are remembered with horror by the inhabitants of Ferns, Callan, Wex- ford, and adjacent districts. I call them foreign con- spirators, for, although unfortunately born in Ireland, they were not of Ireland, and never claimed it as their country. They were chiefly the descendants of the Cromwellian troopers, and some of them sprang from the Scotch, who were brought over by James during the Plantation-of Ulster; the latter are to be distinguished, however, from that noble band of Presbyterians in Ul- ster, whose lives were often freely sacrificed in the cause of their country. From the moment this barbarous col- ony got settled down in the country, they became the bitter and unrelenting persecutors of the Irish Catho- lics. Their power arose not from their numbers so much as from the knowledge that their strength lay in the   THE PTIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      15 maladministration of the laws, and that the executors of the laws were one with themselves. That portion of the Irish Catholics who possessed sufficient manhood to resist this band of marauders, was known by the name of Defenders. From the Wreckers, as I have said, sprang that infa- mous curse of Ireland, Orangeism, and, to. the eternal dishonor of the British government be it for ever re- corded, this Society, whose avowed and proclaimed ob- ject was to " wade knee deep in Popish blood," received the protection of that government by Royal Charter. Father John McAuley, whose life was as innocent and guileless as that of a child, was marked " for doom " by the Wreckers. His house and Chapel, within an easy distance of Fairnfleuch, were " chalked for vengeance", and sentenced to be wrecked and burned. Others were included in the list but not finally agreed upon, and these things arose chiefly from the fact that fair Bridget O'Hara had disdained to accept the hand of a man named Cameron, a wealthy bachelor, who enjoyed as good a farm as the country could boast of. John Mullan was aware of this, but neither he nor Brigid ever thought that any evil would arise from the rejection of Cameron. Mrs. McLeesh, was a sharp, shrewd woman, who, not having much business to attend to, visited her neighbor's houses pretty often, and was on tolerably good terms with all whom she visited. About a week before Christmas she happened to make a call, or, rather, intended to make one at Duncan Cam- eron's; but hearing the noise of many voices inside, re- treated her steps a little, and, in order to be unobserved, quickly stole round to the " back of the house." A small window was open, and she could hear distinctly all that passed. This practice of open windows was often availed of   16  T  IELE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, for such purposes. In country places, where residences were few and scattered, but little precaution was ever taken by those whose deeds were likely to be screened by the authorities;- it was different with those who were opposed to the government. A hot debate was just then going on regarding the burning of the Chapel on Christmas Day, and-the only matter of dispute was, whether the sacrilegious act should take place in the morning, during Mass, or at night, when least expected. Some of the more violent were for the perpetration of the deed early in the morn- ing, but Cameron, wily, cunning, and crafty as a fox, saw at once the impracticability of the scheme, and pointed out that no number of Wreckers in that part of the country were able to perform such murderous deeds when men were present. Finally, he prevailed in his scheme by appealing to the cowardly feelings of his bru- tal gang, and pointing out the dangerous character of the boys of Fairnfleuch. It was arranged then that the wrecking of both house and Chapel should take place on Christmas night. Father McAuley's visit to the- Rogans had a double purpose: first, to protect the property of the Cath- olics by entrusting a number of his- own brave fel- lows with the defence of the Chapel, and, secondly, to get young Cormac to go for Kate, well knowing her re- pugnance to leave the place on that particular day. If Kate remained obstinate, then Cormac was to insist that her uncle's orders must be obeyed. The good old man's anxiety was to keep the whole matter a secret from his niece till all would be over. He knew her reverence and love for the old spot; he knew the depth of her love for him, and so far as it was possi- ble for one in his position to bear human love within his heart, he bore it for that dear girl. For Kate's own sake,ms well as for the memory of his sister who loved him much, Father John almost doated on his niece.   T1iHE PIKFMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      17 The festivities that day in Mrs. Rogan's were of a very humble kind.          I Those in the priest's house were of a happier descrip- tion. Kate O'Neill got to be quite joyful as she saw with what satisfaction her uncle's guests partook of the good food she had placed before them. She joined them in everything, and often wished that her uncle had fore- gone his promise to Mrs. Rogan, in order to see the happy faces around her. Even the blind man looked as happy and as cheerful as the rest, and would turn round to each speaker as if looking them full in the face. Kate was happy! She retired to her room for a short time, in order to thank God for his blessings, and to partake in some measure of the joy of the Queen of the Manger. For a few minutes she was wrapt in thought; then lifting her eyes to a statue of the Madonna, a strange sensation of fear took possession of her soul; an unaccountable dread overpowered her senses, and instinctively she cried out, "Health of the weak, pray for us." The poor guests in the kitchen ran into her room, crying "Miss O'Neill, dear Miss O'Neill, the chapel's ablaze, protect us, O God!" But Kate still knelt; not a muscle moved. The statue before her was not more immovable than was she who knelt there with every sense stunned, with every nerve strung to the utmost. The cries of the poor people con- tinued: almost frantically they shouted, "Save us, save us from the wreckers!' Before calling on Kate, Cormac and the two Mullans were to scour the country for help. Many were waiting for the word,: and would have been on the spot to pro- tect that which was dearer to them than life, but Father John continued to believe that matters would not as- sume so bad an aspect after all. Shortly afterwards, over fifty men arrived upon the spot, but the fire had extinguished itself. Chapels in 2   18    THx'B IRISH WIDOW'S8 SON ; OR, those days had, for the most part, thatched roofs, so that the hands of the miscreants had but little to do in the prosecution of their nefarious schemes. Not a rafter of the building was burned. A light wind had sprung up at the time, and carried the burning thatch into an adjoining field. Not even qaspark could be found in the interior. Father John entered, and with him all those who rushed to save the building. With one accord they knelt at the Altar and poured forth their thanks to God. There were those among them who would have had a hard struggle ere they could have prayed fervently for their enemies. Humbly thankful they were for the protection of the old spot, endeared to them by so many hallowed memories. Many and rapid were the inquiries as to who the vil- lains were who had concocted such a plot. Only a very few were aware of this. Father John knew well that if it were known, bloodshed that night would have been the result. Not even to the faithful Cormac did he disclose the name of his informant, and he felt quite confident. that those who imparted the information tQ him would religiously observe the injunctions he placed upon them as to secrecy. Shortly after, he entered the house in company with a few of those who had hurried to the scene of fire; Cor- mac accompanied them. 3Kate was just leaving her room, and instantly- on beholding her uncle, she rushed toward him as a child, who had escaped some terrible danger, would rush to its father. 'Twas a solemn moment! That instinct of the Irish Catholic heart, which manifests itself on some occasions, prevaded all present.' They felt, they knew, that Kate O'Neill had, by the power of prayer, stayed the ravages of the flames. Cormac Rogan loved her with a deep and almost holy love. He knew that none but himself pos- sessed a place in her pure heart; yet on that instant he   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       19 stood awed in her presence, and turned his head away to conceal the emotions that made his heart beat with a strange uneasiness. Some few remained in the priest's house, lest another attempt should be made to fire the chapel. Contrary to expectation, Kate remained with the com- pany and became quite attentive to the comfort of her guests. She listened with marked interest to the con- versation, and paid particular attention to every utter- ance that bespoke a good wish for Ireland. She was no longer the doubting, childlike girl that she appeared to be in the earlier part of the day. Her faith became strengthened as she listened with pleasure to the re- marks of her uncle on a subject which previously had seldom escaped his lips. Next to God, Ireland was to her the dearest and holiest thought to dwell upon. She had often felt this to be so, but not having much oppor- tunity of learning anything on national matters, she considered it unwise for one of her class to advance her opinions before others. "Then you consider that-a nation whose existence is in jeopardy is a matter for the consideration of its peo- ple independently of its rulers," said Cormac Rogan to Father John. "Certainly not, Cormac. You misunderstand me," re- plied the priest. ' The rulers are the appointed guar- dians of the liberties of a nation, and it is for them to undertake the work of regeneration." "But, if they refuse, or cannot see, or will not under- stand the grievances of a people, but remain persistent- ly blind in their ignorance, what then are the people to do?" inquired Cormac, with much animation, "Then, as all rulers are the servants of the people, it is the duty of those who are sovereign in power, either to make the rulers fulfil the mandates of the people, or remove such rulers as refuse to acquiesce in the nation's demands."   20   *-1: IRISH WIDOW'S SON, OR, -? Are such things applicable only, when people like -ourselves for instance, are subjected to the lawlessness of a mob of Wreckers; or, do your teachings refer to the entire country?" inquired Kate of her uncle. "Certainly, to the whole country," said Cormac, who was anxious just then to stand high in the good graces of the fair querist, and undertook to answer for the clergyman. "Why, really, Cormac," said Father John, " you appear to be as well versed in politico-religious questions as if you had made the matter your particular study. I think you are right, however, but as I have-often told you be- fore, there is no persecution after all so great as persecu- tions for conscience sake." "But who made our rulers the appointed guardians of our liberties?" insisted Kate, "I am sure we never did." "Quite right, Miss O'Neill," said an old man, sitting in a nook by the fireside, quietly smoking his pipe, but lis- tening to all that passed as if he had half a dozen ears. "That involves another and a more serious matter," said Father John. "You know we are bound to acknowl- edge -" "The powers that be" said Cormac, " well I don't; un- less those powers are lawfully constituted, and even then if they outstep their proper line of duty, and tyrannize over a people, making that people to bear burdens whi'ch oppress them, then I go in for their removal." r "So do I," said Kate. "So do we all," cried each in turn. "Hold on, hold on a little," said Father John, rousing himself up in his old chair, his keen grey eyes sparkling as if about to defend some favorite thesis of his own that was being unmercifully handled by clever opponents. "To go in for the removal of any existing authority, without the positive assurance of possessing the means to successfully remove that authority, is to commit a   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      21 greater blunder, and to place the people under a greater tyranny than that which they experience from any rul- ers, be they good or bad." Cormac, Kate, and in fact, the whole of the company were silent, thus permitting Father John to enjoy his triumph. "And must a people be unanimous all in one day, in order to effect what you say?" asked Kate. I'm sure our people never will, they are so frightened of the con? sequences."' "It does not necessarily follow," said her uncle. "Then I suppose they may prepare and organize to at- tain that unanimity," said Cormac, gathering strength and force of argumentative power from the remarks of ate. - "Most decidedly," said Father John, "hbut they must first make sure that they live under an oppression that entitles them so to act." "Quite so," said Cormac, "I understand. But as to the organization?" he inquired. "That will do now, children," said Father John, who began to think that enough ground of that particular kind had been travelled over. While -the old Irish priest and a few of his faithful flock were thus discussing the merits of resistance to their own and their nation's sufferings, quite another kind of conversation was being carried on not a mile off from where they sat.   22   .t  m IRISH WIDOWS SON ; OR, TT AAPTER IV. ORBAlGE CONSPIRACIES-A SHOCK TO THE NERVES- MTT'r GCLlN'Tr. "The wailing of women, the wild ululu, Dread tidings from cabin to cabin convey; But loud tho' the plaints and the shrieks which ensue, The war-cry is louder of men in array." BEAU'Tr1'ULLY situated at the foot of a small hill, was a well built house, remarkable for its snug and cozy ap- pearance, and giving a stranger to understand that its occupants were people well-to-do in the world. Not for -many miles around could a finer homestead be found. The out-offices were in perfect keeping with the house, and gave an air of comfort to the place. Opposite the front entrance was a haggard, well filled with the fruits of the past Autumn. To the left lay piled large heaps of fuel for the winter. This was the house of Duncan Cameron, a Scotch ad- venturer, who only had arrived, in the country some six or seven years ago.          i Duncan Cameron, Esq., as he was sometimes called, was a man of rather unscrupulous character. tHe was about forty years of age, and his appearance was that of a crafty man of the world. Any. one to look steadily at him, would find that he was very much inclined to shift his head in an awkward fashion; not that there was any- thing delicate or bashful in his nature, but that he ap- peared to feel uneasy, and choose not to look a man straight in the face, unless that man were a poor de-   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      23 pendent, and then Mr. Cameron was wonderfully bold, His-.whole appearance was sensual; not openly so, but covered, as far as the canny Scotchman knew how to benefit himself, by the aid of hypocrisy. The farm which belonged to this amiable and highly favored individual, consisted of some sixty acres, and bet- ter land could not be found in the whole province. A for- tunate man was Mr. Cameron, in not having a mill-stone around his neck in the shape of a conscience. Less for- tunate men might have looked upon him as a paragon of wisdom in that respect. Only two short years ago, that farm and homestead, of which the Scotchman felt so proud, belonged to a family named Dorrian, who inherited it from their fath- ers, on the strength of a long lease from Lord O'Neill, and who, in their turn, again inherited it from another family named Dorrian, who also held it from a noble pro- prietor, of the name of O'Neill. In other words, the farm was in the possession of the Dorrians for a longer period than I can tell. Mr. Duncan Cameron was a sort of drover in his earlier days, and, as most people in country parts will talk ill of their neighbors sometimes, by way of lively recreation (especially when said neighbors are well off, and in com- fortable circumstances), it was currently reported that he suddenly came into possession of a sum of money, which he had not honestly earned, neither was it be- queathed to him by legacy, or otherwise. Be that as it may, he managed to get acquainted with an under- strapper on the O'Neill estate, named Fleming.. This man, Fleming, was a great tyrant in his own small way, as most men of his stamp are, when acting in the same capacity. He contrived, on every opportunity, to create an ill feeling between his employer and the Dorrian  family. At first, little heed was given to his stories, for the Dorrians were well liked, and respected; but then,   v24 4   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, Fleming could have no incentive but the discharge of his duties. His opportunities in this way were not few, and, as the family whose destruction he was seeking, knew nothing of his villainy, he managed at last to find a wil- ling ear, and soon succeeded in his efforts in creating a misunderstanding between the Dorrians and-the agent on the estate. Why dwell on the manner in which this was effected? The story is written in blood I The Dorrians, if not legally ejected, were forced to the neces- sity of leaving the country. The younger son, finding out the villiany of Fleming, and meeting him one night, nearly killed the wretch. This hurmried their departure; and Mr. Cameron, being known to be a respectable, thrifty man, had little if any difficulty in obtaining entrance to, and possession of, the house and farm which he coveted so much. This was about four or five years previous to the date at which our story commences. Cameron found himself much disliked, by every one in the neighborhood, although he used every artifice to conciliate his neighbors. By none was he so intensely hated and disliked, as by a poor wandering boy, named Glinty. This lad had been found handy and useful in doing rough work for the Dor- rians, and was at liberty to take up his quarters there whenever he cliose, and to work or not, just as he pleased. After that family had left the place, poor Glinty used to wander about the farm, and involuntarily commenc- ing work, sometimes, just as in former days, he would instantly stop, saying&--"The pip-pip-oor Dorrians are gig-gig-gone, nin-nin-now, and that blib-blib-blag-g-gard has their home, sis-sis-sis-so he has?' If Mike Glinty had a stammer in his speech,--and the first words we hear him utter prove that,-there were moments wlen he could roll out a torrent of words with- out that impediment inconveniencing him in the least. Cameron did not like him, and one day observing him   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      25 near the house, ordered him away, using an oath, at the time, that Alike never forgot. The night after Christmas was bitter cold. A piercing wind whistled through the leafless trees, sounding like a dirge. Not a star shone in the heavens, and not a ray of light was visible, but that which came from the snow that lay covering the earth like a shroud. There were bright fires in the house of Duncan Came- ron, Esq., and a motley company was gathered around them. This company was composed of men, some of whom were well-to-do, and others were of a much lower class. Cameron himself was busily engaged in keeping his party in order; for they talked and shouted in rather a high pitch of voice, at times, for the business they were, engaged in. "Who was appointed to carry out that affair last night?" said one of-the men. "Graham," answered Cameron. "Was he to be here to-night?" was next asked. "He promised us he would." "( He should be strung up by the neck like a dog," said another of the party. "We had one chance, and that having failed, the place will be too well guarded to per- mit us to punish that nest of idolators and traitors." "Never mind," said Cameron; "the worse luck now, the better again. I have news for you, boys; there were no less than five fires last night, in different parts of An- trim and Down." "Bravo!" they all shouted. "Another glass, Cameron, to wash down the news, and to help us to say 'no sur- render,'" said one of the party. This was just what Mr. Cameron wanted to arrive at. He had a plan in his head, and did not care to moot it, till he had- his men well primed. "And what is better than all," said the host, two of the fires were inside of Mass houses."   26    THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; -OR, "Hurrah, boys!" resounded on all sides, " and here's that Cameron may flourish, and that the devil may soon get his own.9" This last was in reference to the Papists. At this-moment a loud knock was heard at the door, and each man sprang to his feet. Cameron and a few of the company rushed out; but, dark as was the night, it appeared doubly dark to them, coming from the well lighted kitchen in which they had been sitting. Came- ron rushed back again into the house, and instantly pro- curing a lantern, ran round about in a11 directions, fol- lowed by those who were brave enough to follow him. Not one man amongst the lot but felt terrified all that night. Cameron and the men returned without the slightest clue as to the cause of the disturbance. Owing to the situation of the house, they believed that no mor- tal being could have been the cause of the loud knock, without being detected, so suddenly were the men in pur- suit. To add -to their perplexity, the dog-house was close by, and Tiger stood up wagging his tail whenever he saw his master. What could it be? That question was easier asked than answered. After some time the party endeavored to forget the in- terruption; but not a man among them could banish from his -thoughts the strangeness of the circumstance. After some more drink had been partaken of, it was finally arranged that one or two " traitors" resident in that part of the country, should be made to quit it. There was the Rogan family, for instance, harboring a pair of rascally United Irishmen, by the name of Mullan, and under the pretence that these men were servants. That scheming mother of Cormac Rogan's was no better than she should be; although the neighbors did endeavor to make it appear that she was a wise and kindly sort of person. But wise here, or kindly there, men's feelings   THE PKT-FMEN  OF NINETY-EIGHT.    27 were not to interfere with their duty to their king and country.  "What say you, boys?" asked Cameron. "To h-1 with the whole lot of them, seed, breed, and generation. So long as the country is cursed with such vipers, there will be no peace for honest people." Such was the infuriated cry of this pack of Orange- men, against those who never did them a wrong, or har- bored a thought of injury toward one of them. And this was the response to Cameron's drunken ap- peal! "But what's to be done, and how -is the work to be carried through?" asked one of the men. "Is it the faggot, or the pistol?" asked another. "Is it waste powder on the likes of them," chimed in a drunken brawler. "Both's best; and whatever is best is surest," put in a -fourth. Finally, it was agreed that word should be sent to the Antrim men to meet a few of the "brethren,"-at the "thorn in the gap," on that night week. ' Of course you'll be there yourself?" said one of the men to Cameron. This was the very thing that Cameron wished to avoid; but the question coming so pointedly, he could not de- cline answering. "Be there myself I he said. "Yes, the first man on the ground!" Coward that he was, he endeavored -to make it appear that his courage was not behind that of any present. After a good deal of dirty hand-shaking, griping of thumbs and fingers, and pressure of horny nails into each other's palms, the company separated, pledged to each other by oaths and curses, to meet like brothers; while the post of honor was awarded to Mr. Cameron; which meant that he was to set fire to the dwelling of the Rogan's.   "E IRISH WIDOW S SON; OR, Quick as the flight of the deer, sped Mike Glinty over the country on the following morning. His face was beaming with intelligence, and every now and again he would suddenly stop short in his career, remain standing buried in thought, then he would cross himself, strike his breast, make a peculiar sound by slapping his open mouth with his hand, and then proceed as quickly as be- fore. Mike was evidently in a great hurry. The morn- ing air was sharp and raw, but Mike was quite in a per- spiration. On his way he met Kate O'Neill, who stopped to inquire the cause of Mike's hasty strides. "Kic-kic-can't tit-tit-take time to-to-tell you, Miss O'Neill," said Mike, scarcely stopping to- speak, " an'-an- an'-even if if-f-f-I had time, wou-wou-wouldn't tell you, Miss O'Neill, nin-nin-no, wou-wou-wouldn't tell you," and on he hurried. Kate watched him for awhile, and presently saw him take a short cut across the field, in the direction of Widow Rogan's. Arrived at home, she found Father John just rising from his knees, having been engaged at some act of devotion. She acquainted him with the fact of having met Mike Glinty, who was crossing the country at a rapid rate, and appeared wild and excited. That he was the bearer of some news to Widow Rogan she believed, and he refused to tell even her his mission. Looking up into her uncle's eyes, Kate inquired if he had heard any news since she went out, or if he thought that some new troubles were at hand ? "Well, my child," said the priest, "I have heard no news, and we are all getting so used to troubles that, when they do occur, we seem to have expected them, and -so they fall lighter on whoever receives them--glory be to God. If you think that Mike was the bearer of any bad news to Cormac or his mother, I have no doubt we shall shortly hear of it. What if I would take a walk over that length, and speak to them, I might learn something? "   "Yes, dear uncle," said Kate, "pray do; my mind is very uneasy regarding them." "To speak the truth, so is mine," said the priest; " and yet, if I were questioned, I could not tell the reason why. However, we shall soon learn." Kate was not long in bringing his overcoat and walk- ing-stick, and Father John stepped out of the door with a light step, but, somehow, with a heavy heart. On he went towards the widow's house, but Mike was there long before him. On entering, Mike saw that Cormac was about to leave on some business. He did not take time to tell him anything, but rather astonished Cormac by catching him tightly by the arm, and returning into the house with him. Mrs. Rogan was engaged in the performance of some household duties, and the two Mullans were just finishing breakfast. Mike sat down, wiped his face with the cuff of his coat, and having invited them all to listei, asked them if they remembered the day after the Dorrians had left, how Cam- eron threatened him with the dog Tiger, if he did not leave off coning about the place? Yes; they all remembered it well enough, and told the poor fellow not to think of such things. "Bib-bib-but Mike will th-th-think of them, just as Mim-m-m-ike pleases, so he will," said the natural, a good deal roused at the recollection of the wrong ; "an- an' if Mim-m-mike hadn't th-th-thought of-f-th-th-that day it would ha-have been worse fif-fif-f-for the whole of you. Lil-lil-ook here, now," he said, and his face was swol- len with rage, " th-th-that threat was worth sis-sis-some- thiig, after all, for, if-f-f th-that devil Cameron hadn't sis- sisL'said it, Mim-m-mike might have been in his bib-b-ed last night, instead of tit-tit-teaching Tiger nin-nin-not to heed pip-p-oor Mim-mim-mike, even for Cameron." He was not long in communicating to these astonished   30.   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, people all - that had taken place the night before in Cam- eron's: how he had gone there at nightfall, as usual, creeping about the place, until he got near the dog- house, where he sat down and held converse, after his own fashion, with the dumb brute, feeding him with his own hands, and telling him, "Mike fond of him, but him not bite Mike-Cameron not good, kicked Tiger one day," and the dog half growled, as if he comprehended every word Mike said. Next he described how he heard the loud talk, and the cursing and swearing of the men; how he went from window to door, and back again, listening to every word, and finally, how he thought if he only had a blazing turf in his hand, how heI would have burned the house over their heads, "only they were not drunk enough, nor sleeping," added Mike. Again he described his feelings when he thought of good Cor- mae and his mother, and John Mullan, and Peter Mul- lan,-and Mike looked bewildered, and seemed to forget one half of all he had to say, as he looked at Peter and John alternately. "I give a jum-m-p like that"--and here Mike cut a caper, and sprang upward fully three feet from the ground--" an'-an' with a-a-big stone was go- go-goin' to kill Cameron, but just give th-th-the door one th-th-thump, an' out they all-ran." Mike then described the race in the dark, to find out the cause of the noise at Cameron's door, and laughed heartily at the idea of the search, while he himself was quietly concealed in the rear of the turf-stack watching Cameron run here and there like a Will-o'-the-wisp, with his lantern} in hand, and, as Mike shrewdly remarked, afraid to venture twenty yards from his companions. He assured those whom he addressed, that not one of the men could find out what he did, and that they did not for a moment ascribe the interruption to the right cause. When Mike had finished the recital of his wonderful news, Mrs. Rogan had taken a seat beside the fire, and, witfljher head bent down, was lost in thought.   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.        31 Cormac's eyes flashed fire, and, as his mother looked up at him now and again, it was evident that thoughts of her son and the course he was likely to pursue under these circumstances, were as trying to her heart as the grief occasioned her by the tidings which the faithful Mike had just communicated. The family circle joined in conversation as to the prob- able motive of Cameron in selecting a widow's house for such vengeance. It was well known that he was the friend and favorite of the yeomanry under Lord Massarene and Lord O'Neill. In consequence of this he was dreaded by the country people, and secretly hated, as he was dreaded. There was nothing for it, therefore, but to await the current of events, and prepare to meet them as best they could. The reign of martial law, and the suspension of all lib- erty as far as the poor Catholics were concerned, had rendered their lives miserable. The magistracy of the country was, without exception, in the hands of Orange landlords, and even the poorest attempt at redress was never dreamed of on the part of the persecuted race. Cormac Rogan was evidently in a bad state of mind. He felt that the independence of his position, which he had fought so manfully against adverse circumstances to attain, was the cause, in some way, why Cameron and his myrmidons had selected his mother's house for de- -struction. To say that he loved his mother with a full and ardent affection, would be trite and commonplace. He owed everything to her devoted care, and right loy- ally did he repay that mother's anxiety for his welfare. He was both husband and son in one; and felt as proud of the widow as ever son felt for a mother. His obedi- ence to her every wish was proverbial all over the coun- try; and, for the first time in his life, he meditated the *             *he:   32    ThE IRISH WIDOW' SON; OR, taking of a step which she had often disapproved. In yielding to her wishes heretofore, Cormac did so more to- please her, than from any reasonable objections which could be urged against the course he felt inclined to follow. In the middle of a dead silence which prevailed, and during which the brothers watched, with a deep inter- est, the unspoken dialogue between mother and son, Father John entered, and, after his usual salutation of peace to all present, shook Cormac warmly by the hand. The priest knew that Kate's surmises were true, in some way, and one glance at the family, and then at Mike, confirmed his worst suspicions. "It is pleasanlt to get near the sweet-smelling turf-fire, on a day like this, Cormac," said Father John. "Yes, your reverence," said the young man; " the com- fort of one's home is the happiest comfort in life." "True, my boy, quite true; just the very thing I often say to Kate, and the poor girl smiles her answer to her uncle, Cormac." "But, as times go, Father John, the comfort of home is a thing that we enjoy on sufferance. Let some villain stick a pike-head in the thatch, or conceal a'pistol about a poor woman's premises, or even harbor an ill feeling, without cause, and the bloody Yeos are ready, with sword and faggot--." "Oh, never mind, Cormac. Of course, these are times of wearisome trouble for the whole of us; but there is no use tormenting ourselves with misgivings and fears, that, I trust in God, will never be realized." a' I'm not given to either, Father John," said Cormac- and the young man stretched himself to his full height, his hands clenched, and his breast heaving, as the words of the priest were causing thought after thought to rise in his mind--" but when there is just cause, not only for fears and misgivings, but for our lives, our altars, and our homes, I think it is high time to act a man's part."   THE PIKEMEN, OF NINETY-t'lU .  Father John looked bewildered; things were evidently worse than he had supposed. "Fif-f-for one, I'll be a man," said poor Mike. "I'm just in receipt of bad news, shortly before you came in, Father John," said Cormao. "That poor fellow there " he said, pointing to Mike," has brought us intelli- gence, that a meetinmg of Orange scoundrels was held last night at Duncan Cameron's, and the blood-hounds have selected my mother's humble roof for destruction, and -the lives of us, one and all, to be sacrificed, if neces- sary, to the hellish designs of that man and his crew." "What course do you intend to follow?" asked Father John, with a mildness that ill became the private feelings of the old man's heart. "What course do I intend to pursue?" said Cormac, repeating the priest's words;, "what course would you pursue, if you were in my place, and under such circum- stances?" asked Cormac. "Defend myself and my property to the last moment," said the old man, sternly; "if I thought I were fit to ac- complish either the .one or the other." Peter and John Mullan jumped to their feet, while Cormac caught the priest by the hand. "Defend my mother's roof-tree! Yes; by --- "Take care, Cormac," said Father John; "stain not your lips, myboy, by dishonoring the name of Him whose obedient child you have ever been." The widow sighed, and silently clasped her hands to- gether. "Your blessing, mother!" said Cormac; and he knelt down beside her. "God bless you, my child, and have you in His holy keeping. Do nothing rash, my son; nothing that will ever cause you a moment's pain in after life; nothing that will tarnish the memory of your father, nor defile the name you bear. 3   34    THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "Never fear," said the young man; " we are a pack of slaves on the land God gave us for an inheritance; we are shackled at the foot of the altar; widows and or- phans cry to heaven for help, and vengeance is burning in the hearts of the people, if they would but acknowl- edge it. Come along, John, and you, Peter. Let mother and Father John have a chat by themselves; we can have the same outside; and, Mike, you sit and warm yourself, like a good fellow." "Do-do-don't like to be a gig-gig-good fellow," said Mike ; "warmenough, sis-sis-so I am-go out, too." "Come along, then," said Cormac, and the young men, accompanied-by Mike, left the house. After some conversation with Widow Rogan, during which he used every effort to comfort and console her under this heavy affliction, and endeavored to make it appear that Mike may have been mistaken, or that some- thing would interfere to prevent the expected catastro- phe, the good pastor took his leave. Widow Rogan was a woman of few words ; her strength of character had, nobly carried her through many of the world's difficulties. Cormac partook largely of her own nature, and it was not without some misgivings that she observed his ap-. pearance while listening to Mike Glinty, and conversing with Father John. Inwardly she admired her young son for his determination to preserve their hearth from the threatened desecration of Cameron; but she dreaded the results of this determination, lest they should lead to her further bereavement, if anything should happen to him.   THE PIKE MEW   OF NINETY-EIGHT.     35 CHAPTER V. ORIGIN OF THE UNITrED IRISHMEN-ORANGE CONSPIRACY TO BURJN WIDOW IOGANSS HOUSE. "Bide your time, the moM is breaking, Bright with Freedom's blessed ray; Millions, from their trance awakling, Soon shall stand in firm array. XMan shall fetter man no longer; Liberty shall march sublime: Every moment makes you stronger- Firm, unshrinking, bide your time!" THE facts related in the foregoing chapter, are the barest epitome of the hardships and trials endured by the Catholics of the North of Ireland, in '97-'98. The same is true of their. sufferings for five or six years pre- vious, and for many years afterwards; but the horrors of those two years are unequalled and unparalleled, so far as Ulster is concerned. The quartering of soldiers and-yeomanry on the poor inhabitants, the destruction of dwellings, the firing of chapels, the hangings and flog- gings, the embowelling of dead bodies, the religious and political disabilities of those who were graciously per- mitted to live, the danger of attending market or fair, the terror of those who had cattle or provisions to dis- pose of, lest they should offend their Orange neighbors- all these things combined, roused a portion of the peo- ple to madness, and made them only too glad to join any association that promised them relief. When we bear in mind that the governmental pretext for all these cruelties was the subjugation of the Catho-   36   ?tMiE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, lies, who merely sought their own emancipation, the heart of every honest man must writhe in agony at the memories of that period. England felt it necessary to crush the independence of Ireland, and for that purpose scrupled not to grant every license to her agents, in' whose behalf it maybe said, that so far as evil ingenuity could go, they unflinchingly a'nd perseveringly carried out her behests to the' veriy letter. In the May of 1791, the first meeting of United Irish- men was held on McA-rts Forth, the summit of-- the Cave- Hill Miountain^,near Belfast. That was the inauguration meeting, at which Wolfe Tone, Sam Nelson, and others, were present. The object of the Association was simply to obtain for the people of Ireland, the full and free exercise of their liberties. Although the first adherents of this body were Presbyterians--to their eternal honor be it recorded- Catholic Emancipation stood prominent on their pro- gramme. That programme was intended to regulate the acts of the Irish Parliament; and had- the latter been really what its name implied, instead of the monopoliz- ing oligarchy of England, it would have adopted it at once.  It ran as follows:- "We have agreed to form an association to be called the Society of United Irishmen; and we do pledge our- selves to our country, and mutually to each other, that we will steadily support, and endeavor by all means to carry into effect, the following resolutions: ' That the ,weight of English influence in the government of this country is so great as to require a cordial union among all the people of Ireland, to maintain that balance which is essential to the preservation of our liberties, and the extension of our commerce. That the sole constitu- tional mode by-which this influence can be opposed, is by a complete and radical reform of the representation of   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       37 our people in Parliament. That no reform is practicable, efficacious, or just, which shall not include Irishmen of every religious persuasion."'  There can be no doubt that the French Revolution- gave an impetus to the founders of this society, and there can be as little doubt that its members sought by the use of legitimate means alone, the fulfilment of their programme, before the idea of having recourse to arms ever crossed their minds. The first great impetus given to this society was in July of the following year, on the occasion of a review of the Ulster Volunteers, in Belfast, " in honor of that day, which presented the sublime spectacle of one-sixth of the inhabitants of Europe, bursting their chains, and throwing off, almost in an instant, the degrading yoke of slavery." The popular sentiments of the people found expres- sion in mottoes on transparencies, such as: "May the example of one revolution prevent the necessity of oth- ers." "May all governments be those of the laws, and all laws, those of the people." "May the free nations of the world vie with each in promoting liberty, peace, vir- tue, and happiness among men." In that same year, the Belfast Light Dragoons issued a declaration, 'stating that a government by King, Lords, and Commons-the Commons being freely, and frequently chosen-is the best adapted to the genius of the country. The first petition that emanated from any Protestant body, praying for the immediate and unconditional eman- cipation of the Roman Catholics, came from the Protes- tants and Dissenters of Belfast. A leading spirit at that time was Mr. Thomas Milliken, the father of Israel Milliken, who will figure in the future chapters of this historical tale. This gentleman, togeth- er with the Thompsons, Sinclairs, McDonnells, Mont-   38   'TH1E IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, gomerys, Magees, and Nelsons, addressed the inhab- itants of Belfast, in 1792, in the following terms:- "As men and as Irishmen, we have long lamented the degrading state of slavery and oppression, in which the present majority of our countrymen are held; nor have we lamented it in silence. We wish to see all distinc- tions on account of religion abolished, - all narrow, par- tial maxims of policy done away. We anxiously wish to see the day when every Irishman will be a citizen,-- when Catholics and Protestants, equally interested in their country's welfare, possessing equal freedom and equal privileges, shall be cordially united, and shall learn to look upon each other as brethren, the children of the same God, the natives of the same land, -and when the only strife among them shall be -' who shall serve their country best!" Such programmes, resolutions, and declarations, soon produced a feeling of brotherly love among all true Irishmen. To obtain 'redress, by every legal and con- stitutional means, was the aim of the founders of this society; but finding that their efforts in this way were of no avail, that they were treated with contumely while they themselves were despised by those to whom they appealed, the society merged from an open into a secret one. Its progress in the latter character was even great- er than when its councils were open and aboveboard. This is partly accounted for by the secrecy of the Orange society, whose members were enabled to effect their evil purposes with greater certainty anal security on account of that secrecy. Many of the country people joined the society of lUnited Irishmen; not so much in opposition to the government, as such, but for mutual protection- of their lives and properties. John and Peter Mdulan had been active members - for some time, and used their influence to make Cormac   THE PIrKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     39 Rogan " one -of themselves." Cormac resisted all their persuasions, not from any feeling that he entertained against the society or its members, but from a fear that his enrolment would displease his friends. The late con- versation with Father John had, to some extent, removed his fears, so that the entreaties of the Mullans were gaining on his mind every day. The attempt to burn the chapel, and the selection of his own dwelling for destruc- tion, finally overcame all his scruples, and made him as anxious to join the United Irislmnen, as he was previous- ly averse to such a step. After leaving his' mother and Father McAuley, Cor- mac, in company with the Mullans and Mike, proceeded across the country to Pat Dolan's house, a well known rendezvous of the United men. Suddenly turning at the base of a hill, Mike grasped e Cormac by the arm, and pointed to a dog. "What do you mean, Mike?" said Cormac. "Did-did-don't you see, th-th-the dog, the dog?" "Yes; I see a dog,--but what of that?" "Ti-ti-Tiger," said Mike,"-"Cameron not fif-fif-far off." "The lad's right," said Peter Mullan. Cormac suddenly stood still. His whole body quiv- ered with emotion, and it was evident from his appear- ance that, if Cameron crossed his path just then, a seri- ous encounter would take place. In a minute or so, they saw Cameron, in company with Mackenzie, the Captain of the Yeomanry, and Fleming. Their direction lay in- a different way, and so the parties did not approach each other; neither did it appear that Cameron had ob- served Cormac or those in whose company he was. Ar- r i rived at Dolan's -house, Cormac was not long in an- r nouncing his desire to join the Society of United Irish- men. Dolan clasped him kindly and warmly by the hand, and when Cormac confided to him the news he had learned that day, honest Pat Dolaln' surprise knew   40    THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, no bounds. Dolan was a blacksmith by trade. He had two strapping sons, Phil and Ned, as they were familiar- ly called, who, besides assisting their father, took charge of a small farm. Their mother was a true type of the Irishwoman, who had conceived a strong liking for Cor- mac Rogan, and was anxious that her sons should " throw themselves more in his way," as she preferred his com- panionship to that of others, for Phil and Ned. Pat Dolan expected a stranger that night from Belfast, and expressed a desire that Cormac would return again in the evening with the Mullans. Cormac assented, but could not leave his mother alone; so that either Peter or John must remain in the house during his absence. Peter proffered himself, and matters being thus ar- ranged, they returned, not wishing to cause the widow any anxiety additional to that which she had to bear. Father John had a heavy heart after parting with Mrs. Rogan. "It is a sad thing," he said to himself, " that the best and dearest of my poor people are thus exposed, daily and nightly, to the vengeance of those infamous men whose hands atre never clean of the blood of inno- cent people. Is there to be no end to this state of things? or, what will the final result of them be if they continue to go on at this rate?" Arlived at home, Kate betrayed the greatest anxiety to learn if her surmises regarding Mike's hasty march over the country were correct, "Alas'! too correct, too true; " said her uncle; "and my fears are, that they do not know the worst of it." "It was some good power that directed poor Mike to Cameron's," said the girl. "God often makes use of the humblest instruments to carry out His -designs." "Quite true," replied Father John; "and my sincere prayer is, that matters may appear worse at the present moment than they really are, perhaps." "Aye, perhaps," Uncle.   THE PTKCEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      41 "Yes, perhaps;" he repeated, and the sorrowful feel- ings of the good old man found vent in tears. With a loving tenderniess, Kate tried to soothe him, but it was no use; he was overwhelmed with sorrow and affliction, and earnestly besought heaven to spare him any further pain in witnessing and hearing the terrible scenes and details that were so constantly before him. That was indeed a sight to behold. The old Irish priest standing almost on the brink of the grave, looking around him mentally, and beholding those who in happier days he had baptized, now suffering the heaviest persecutions .for the promises, "I BELI;EVE," which were uttered, through their sponsors, at the fount of holy baptism. To behold that weeping girl at his side, whose purity of heart and goodness of mind were stamped on every action of her life, dividing her sorrow with her beloved relative and those whose sufferings caused his own. Well was it that such affliction was hidden from the sturdier portion of Father John's flock. The sight would have been too much for the one-tenth of them to bear. "It's a good point, after all, to be forewarned of the danger," said Kate. "In one way it is, and in another way it is not," ret plied her uncle. "Yes, I understand," she said. "No doubt Cormac will make preparations for the defence of his place, and, God help us, there may be lives lost in that same defence." "It is hard to say," said Father John; "l but, if I am to judge by the young man's appearance to-day, there was some terrible resolve working in his mind. His mother, too, God help her, saw danger brooding in his looks." Kate was silent. The workings of her mind were va- ried and perplexing. Father John retired to his room, there to reflect on the wonderful and mysterious ways of God, who permitteth things to happen which no hu- man power can divine.   42    TEl'  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, CHAPTER VI. ISRAEL MTTT, I k:N--DEATH OF /TTAM O RR-F --HS DYING. DECLARATIONi . "He dies to-day," said the heartless Judge, Whilst he sat him down to the feast; And a smile was on his ashy lip, As he uttered a ribald jest." PROCEEDING quietly on his business, a man dressed in the garb of the Society of Friends might have been seen wending his way, from an early hour, on the Belfast road, toward Antrim. As he approached the village of Templepatrick, he betrayed some signs of uneasiness, especially when he saw the residence of the Rev. Mr. Por- ter strictly guarded by soldiers. This reverend gentle- man, the, author of a very seditious song, known by the name of "Cruiskeen Lawn,"-' was suspected of being a member of the Society of United Irishmen, and from re- ports which reached the ears of the authorities, his house was visited regularly by soldiers and yeomanry, as a pre- caution against the visits of strangers, and to watch that the premises concealed no firearms. Our Quaker friend had to intention of loitering on his journey; but, happening to possess an inquistive turn of mind, he approached the house of Mr. Porter, and, in a :*The Rev.

"Is the rebel A friend of yours?" "Easy," said the Quaker; " thou-and-he-are-alike -my--friends; you-are-my-brother, and-he-is- --my--brother."a "Oh, stuff! you're all alike, black cloth, and drab cloth, I see no difference," said the soldier. "Why-not-say-red-cloth-also, friend?" "Come, go your way, old fool," said the soldier, in an irritated tone. , Hmust--fst-t-speak--with-my-brother, if-thou pleasest, friend," said the Quaker, quite unmoved. "'Be quick, then," said the soldier; " we can't remain here, dawdling away our time with the likes of you. Here, Sandy, see this man inside, and remain there while he remains. Don't be long." "A' richt, Major; I ken hoo to act as weel's ony ither. A sharp een, an' a quick lug for a'." So saying, the Scotchman and Quaker entered. The Rev. Mr. Porter was in the act of speaking very hurriedly to his servant-maid. On seeing the Quaker in company with the soldier, he betrayed some uneasiness, and inquired their business. A steady glance atthe eyes of the Quaker, through the large spectacles which he wore, caused them instantly to shake hands, Mr. Porter apolo- gizing, in an off-handed why, for not instantly knowing his old friend and neighbor, Josiah Wilson. "Will ye no' step in a wee, an' tak' a mouthfou' o' something to sen' the heat through your shiverin' banes?" said the servant, addressing Sandy. "Gin ye speir after my health in that fashion, lassie, I canna weel see what richt I hae to refuse your kind- ness," said Sandy, not in the least displeased at the rough and ready invitation. "That girl is worth her room," said the Quaker to Mr, Porter.   "  'TlHEI IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "Her services are invaluable," said the latter; "but what in the name of heaven, Milliken, made you dare so much-?" "( ever mind," said Israel Milliken, alias the Quaker, Josiah Wilson. "I'm four Randalstown, to-night; going to preach, you know. Whato about the two wide mouths?" "Safely stowed away at the foundation of the meeting- house." This was in reference to two field-pieces, presented by a-merchant in Belfast, who was a leading member of the organization. "Mony thanks, lassie; an' gin ye be a sojer on duty, o' a cauld day, I warrant ye, I'll stan' as muckle." Sandy now appeared, smacking his lips, just as the Quaker and the clergyman were taking leave of each other. "I'm in nae hurry," said Sandy, quite patronizingly; -ye may talk awa thegither there as lang as ye please." "Talk-is- always--dangerous--friend," -said the Quaker,-" bu-never-more-so-than-now;" and the two passed out together. Josiah proceeded on his way, sometimes walking as if afflicted with rheumatism in his knees, again, moving on briskly, and humming the air, "Cruiskeen Lawn." ,That night there was a large meeting held in a barn be- longing to Pat Dolan. Dolan's house and workshop, the latter commonly known by the name of "Smiddy," were well situated for the purposes to which they were often de- voted. Four houses stood at the angles 'of a square, about five hundred yards distant from each other, and Pat's oc- cupied a position nearly in the centre. Each of these houses was occupied by friends; and MHilliken used often to aver, that he never felt comfortable except when in- side Pat Dolan's Smiddy. There were reasons for this, which will become apparent as we proceed. Late that evening there was a grand muster of men in Dolan's house, and in the forge also. Mr. Milliken was   ITHE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      45 momentarily expected. "Speak o' the deil, and he'll ap- pear," said one of the men, as our Quaker friend just en- tered. "Any news, any news?" cried several at the same mo- ment. "Take your time a little, boys," said Pat, vWho appeared in excellent spirits that eveinng. "I have first to intro- duce to you, Mr. 5Milliken, our friend, Cormac Rogan, as true a boy as ever sprang from the sod. Mr. ]Milliken, Mr. Rogan;' and the Quaker grasped the hand of our young friend with cordial warmth. "Any news?" cried some of the men again. "Lots of news-good news and bad news," said Milli- ken. "Just as I left Dublin, after an interview with the leading members of the Directory, it was reported that Lord Charlemont was turned rebel, and as such must be strictly watched." Bravo!" shouted several voices. "A letter had been found, said to have been written by his lordship to a friend. In that letter the following words occur: 'Indeed, among the sad effects of the present abominable transactions, none is more striking than that our feelings have been blunted by the perpetual repetition- of horrors; and the man who would formerly have wept over the loss of an individual, can now bear, unmoved, the death of thousands.'" "The copy I hold in my hand," said Milliken, " was ob- tained by one of ourselves, who occupies a post in Dub- lin Castle." I'm afraid, boys," continued the speaker, "there are some in our body who are keeping the government post- ed in the matter of our private transactionS; and, not knowing who they are, we have adopted the enemy's tactics, and sent our spies into the Castle itself. Let the Viceroy find them out if he can. And now, boys, one of the chief purposes of my visit here to-nighti is to warn   "   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, you against any strangers who, may come amongst you in the guise of friends." "Never mind," said Dolan, "we have our eyes open. Since that day of Orr's execution, we have learned a les- son. That villain, Landy, never showed his face in these quarters since." "Poor Orr!" said the Quaker, and his eyes filled with tears. "The last time I shook him by the hand, lifttle did I think that in a few short weeks his body would be hanging from the gallows. His poor wife is broken- hearted, and won't be long behind him, I fear, and then what becomes of the five poor orphans?" "God look to them," responded several of those present; "sure we'll support them and rear them our- selves." "All that is provided for," said Milliken; "but who can restore their father?" The fate of William Orr, of Ferranshane, in the Coun- ty of Antrim, did more to influence the minds of the peasantry than all the councils of the United Irishmen. That man's death was simply a butchery in cold blood. He was accused of administering the oath of the United Irishmen to a soldier named Whleatley. That same sol- dier came forward afterwards, and made an affidavit that his testimony against Orr was FALSE! It was of no use. The government wanted victims, and must have them. Two of the jurors also made an affidavit, that, on the night of the trial, a quantity of spirituous liquors had been conveyed to the jury-room, that they, and sev- eral others, were int xicated---that one of them was threatened with being prosecuted as an United Irishman if he did not concur in a verdict of "GUILTY!"-that at length he did so, contrary to his judgment-worn out by fatigue and drink, and- subdued by menaces. Subse- quently the whole of the jurors substantiated the sworn' testimony of the two-all did not save Orr.   THE1 PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       47 On the day of his execution, the people closed up their houses and places of business, and retired into the country, their whole appearance betokening grief at the untimely and cruel death of their- innocent friend and neighbor.       .                 1 The execution took place on the 14th day of October, 1797.

How far they have been so, I leave to that country from which they have been chosen to determine; and how far they have discharged their duty, i leave to their God and themselves. They have, in pronouncing their verdict, thought proper to recommend me as an object of humane mercy; in return, I pray to God, if they have erred, to have merey on them. The judge who condemned me, humanely shed tears in uttering! my sentence; but whether he did wisely in so highly conm- mending the wretched informer, who swore away my life, I leave to his own cool reflection, solemnly assuring him, ancd all the world with my (ying breath, that that informer was foresworn. The law under which I suffer, is surely a severe one; may the makers and promoters of it be justified in the integrity of their motives, and the purity of their own lives. By that law I am stmped a felon, but my heart disdains the imputation. My comfortable lot and industrious course of life best refute the charge of being an adventurer for plunder; but if to have loved my country, to have known her wrongs and to have felt the injuries of the persecuted Catholics, and to have united with them, and all other religious persuasions, in the most orderly  and least sanguinary means of procuring redress; --if these be felonies, I am a felon, but not otherwise. Had my counsel, for whose honorable exertions I am indebted, prevail- ed in their motion to have me tried for high treason, rather than under the Insfurrection Lat, I should have been entitled then to a full defence, and my actionsandintentions have been better vindicated; but that was refused,and I must now submit *The dying Declaration of Orr was published at the time of his execution- but the Government of the day, dreading its in- fluence, had it suppressed.

CARICKFERGUS JHAIL, Oct. 5th; 1797. ,; N. B. The declaration was signed by William Orr, in the presence of the Rev. Mr. Savage. , There was work done in Pat Dolan's that nigt. Thirty stand of arms, and nearly a hundclred pikes, were unearthed from  their, hiding-place, and delivered to those in attendance. The pike-heads were the handi- work of Pat Dolan and his sons, Phil and Ned. It was amusing to hear Pat ridicule those who possessed the guns, telling them they were sure to be shot while Ioad- ing them, while the fellows with the pikeswere compli- mented. "Not thatI should praise the goods," said Pat, "be- cause I Smade them myself. But don't you all know, boys, that the British are famed for their charges; and when I say the British, I mean our own poor fellows also, whom bad luck has cast into the red-coat frater- nity'.

Now whlat is a bayonet   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     49 but a pike-head spoiled?"And so he continued expatiat- ing on the merits of his favorite. It was a beautiful, clear, moonlight night, and Milli- ken took out lhis men to allow them to stretch their limbs, as one of them remarked. Scouts were placed in commanding positions while the men were put through their drill exercise. Cormac Rogan was provided with a gun-an article' which he was used to handle long before--and repeated- ly expressed his satisfaction to John Mullan, at the step he had taken. "uHad it not been that I knew you well, Cormac, and knew your love for the old country, it's many a time I could have felt angry with you," "Better late than never," said Cormac; "I must just  now endeavor to pull up for lost time. What is your opinion about mentioning that affair to iMr. Milliken?" "Don't speak of it. I have been thinking the matter over in my own mind. Such a course might lay you open to suspicion, and I cannot bear that." "Suspicion! How?" said Cormac, quite roused. - "Understand what I mean. Some of the men present might think that you joined us merely through fear, or to obtain assistance." "Such a thought never entered my mind," said Cormac, warmly; " and I would not accept it if offered to me!" "I know that,'" replied Mullan; " but you are a young hand among us yet, and I am too anxious that the men ietain the high opinion they have of you, than run any chance of losing it by taking the opportunity of telling them anything." Cormac assented to this arrangement, as he began to view the matter in the light that Mullan saw it. "Besides," said the faithful fellow, "you and Peter, Pat Dolan, and perhaps the two boys and myself, will be more than a match for all that Cameron can bring."   50   fTHE  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; Ot, "Yes; " said Cormac--" it is quite natural for the Do" lans to' take a walk over, and sit awhile; and now that I look deeper into the matter, the less preparation,-seeing that we are supposed to know nothing of what has happened, the better, I think, after all." "We can prepare as we like, and we must prepare, and well, too; but I tlink it better not to have large num- bers." "Pikes to the front and muskets in the rear,' shouted, Milliken. "Didn't I know it," said Pat. In the moment of dan- ger, it's in the front the pikes will be." "Sling pikes, and rest on left knee-quick!" shouted the commander. "There it's again," said Pat, half wild with delight. "Sure that's just the same order as ' prepare to receive cavalry.'" ' Quite right,' said Milliken, coming up to Pat at the same moment. After an hour's sharp work, the men re-entered, and Israel Milliken complimented them on, their precision and attention to orders. He encour- aged them to perseverance, and spoke of the high hopes that animated the members of their body. His position enabled him to speak positively of their in- creasing numbers, which, even then, were little short of 250,000 men, ready to take the field at any given moment against the troops of Britain. TrueF a good round num- ber of their best men were in jail, but, such things were expected; they were the natural result of the organiza- tion; but no matter what happened, the rank and file of the men were to remain pledged to each other like brothers, and nothing was to separate them in the good work they were engaged in. After a few more encourag- ing remarks, and giving instruction to- Dolan, to employ a couple of extra hands in the forge, Israel Milliken tookl his leave to attend a similar meeting in Randalstown.   ITHl PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      51 CHAPTER VII. ATTEMPT TO BURN A WIDOW'S HOUSE--THE WRECKLSJ8 GA T,TANTLY DEFEATED. "Take courage, now, my brave boys, For here you have good friends; And we'll send a convoy with you, Down by their Orange dens. THE wildest rumors were now flying in all directions over the country. At one time, Wolfe Tone had effected a landing, with one hundred thousand Frenchmen, who were joined by the peasantry, and carrying everything victoriously before them. At another, the Dublin Di- rectory had been surprised at one of their sittings, and every member made a prisoner, One thing, however, was certain. Daily outrages were becoming more frequent. The Government, acting on the stories of Edward John Newell, the informer, were filling the jails to repletion, although that arch-fiend subsequently confessed that these same stories were neither more nor less than the works of his own imagination. What thoughts arise in one's mind, at the idea of statesmen laboring under the most terrible hallucina- tions, and shalingwwith fear, at the stories of an unsup- Ported informer, one of the vilest Villains, even on his own confession, that the world ever produced. And the fact is now a matter of history, that this same. Newell, in his examination before a secret committee of the Irish House of Commons, threw his audience into a   52    THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, perfect panic, by describing things that never happened, ' and which sensible men would have known could never happen. What Newell was to the North, O'Brien and Major Sirr were to Dublin and its vicinity. These things considered, and keeping before our minds the protection offered to such men as Cameron, Fleming, and Mackenzie, by the ct of Indemnity, it is not to be wondered at that pike-making was so ardently followed by the Pat Dolans of the period. On the same evening that a meeting of drunken. Orangemen was held at Cameron's to arrange the attack on widow Rogan's-prompted solely by revenge because its humble roof gave shelter to the accepted lover of Brigid O'Hara-Cormac and his friends were in consul- tation as to their method of defence. Pat Dolan was present, and in no very amiable mood, either.  "You go over, Mrs. Rogan, to my wife,-she will be lonely when we're all away. Leave this business to us, we'll settle it-and if Cormac would take my advice he would go also. Things wont turn out as badly as we expect." Cormac at once dissented,but advised his mother's go- ing. With a heavy heart the widow, accompanied by Peter Mullan, left her dwelling, not knowing if she would ever enter it again. Cormac's proposal was, for all to leave the house, and, under the darkness of the night, take up a position where they could best guard the place. John Mullan and Dolan opposed this arrangement. They would remain inside for better protection to themselves; they were well armed; the scoundrels who might come there would surely be the same. If blood were spilled, it was not at their seeking. Cameron had provided himself with a warrant from   'THE PIKEMEN OP NINETY-EIGHT.      53 Col. Barber, of Belfast, to search Rogan's house* for fire- arms, believing the same to be concealed upon the prem- ises. It was near midnight when the quick ear of Cor- mac caught the sound of voices outside. He and his companions sat breathlessly listening. The fire had been allowed to burn down, and the place was nearly in total darkness. In a few minutes a loud knock was heard at the door. No attention paid to it, another and a fiercer one was given; Cormac demanded to knowwho was there? He got for his reply: "Open, or we'll burst in the door!" "Do so, at your peril," he shouted, "and the first man that crosses the threshold will be carried out a corpse!" The door was, strongly barred, and, after repeated efforts to break it in, a voice was -heard outside giving the word to fire into the roof, " and set the popish den in blazes." "I knew how it would be," said Cormac, almost fran- tically, as he made a rush to open the door,--but Dolan prevented him. "Remain as you are," said Pat, authoritatively, and he posted his own sons at each side of the door; John and Peter were placed one at each window, while himself and Cormac occupied the centre of the kitchen, at an angle with the window. Tmmediately a  shot was fired outside; the windows were shivered to atoms, and, at a signal from Dolan, all six fired at the same instant. The report was terrific, and the wreckers, some fifteen or twenty, fell back, as if an army had been confined within the house. Two of their number were wounded, and Cameron wisely beat a retreat, amid the curses and execrations of his men at the doom that had befallen them. Gig-gig-gone like hell-hounids, shouted a voice out. side.   54   TI'IEl IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, -Mike's voice was instantly recognized. The door was quickly unbarred, and the whole party rushed out. The shot fired into the roof had taken no effect, as the thatch was damp from frost. Word was instantly despatched to Cormac's mother how matters stood, and Cormac's friends remained with him till morning. The report quickly spread over the country of what, had happened, and a new spirit was roused among the people. Father John and his niece were not long in learning the state of the case, and right thankful were both that no greater damage had been effected. It turned out that the wounded man belonged to the party who attacked the Dolans at Antrim Fair, and one of them, a man named' Mallon, said, that better luck- he didn't deserve. When his wife was on her death-bed, it was the widow Rogan who came to see her, and to assist her with many a little comfort that she could not other- wise have received. Remorse of conscience added not a little to Mallon's sufferings. He maintained, that if ever he got well, he would certainly do all in his power to make restitution for the evil he had committed. After leaving in hot haste, Cameron's party-went, with their gallant leader, to his residence. Their " brotherly love" seemed to have cooled down in proportion as the drink they had partaken of lost its effects. "It was a prudent act, boys, to retire," said Cameron. Ill lay my life there wasn't less than sixty or seventy Croppies in that house, and I'll make affidavit to that effect."  "There's no use in talking," said one ,of the party, ( there wasn't a dozen in it. I)o you think, if there had been as many as you say, that they would have remained inside? Not them, indeed. They would have been out   THE PlIKa MEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      55 before you could have-said ' Jack Robinson,' and let fly at the whole of us." "I say it's a lie!" said Cameron, considerably roused.  "Didn't we hear the report of thirty or forty guns at once?" A loud laugh was the answer of the previous speaker. "I say, Cameron," he continued,"did you ever hear the report of forty guns, at 6nce, in all your life?" "I want no more talk with you," said Cameron, in a sulky mood. "No, of course you don't," said the other, "for fear I'd tell you that you were the first to show your heels." Cameron could ill brook this allusion to his cowardice, and adroitly endeavored to change the conversation. The rough nature of his companion, however, would not per- mit this, and the result was a bloody fight among the party. Tumblers and pewter measures were freely used, on both sides, and left evidence sufficient on the faces of the combatants, to show the strength of the hands that used them. The fellow who had accused Cameron so roundly of cowardice, had plenty to side with him, and, before they left off, 1Mr. Cameron's comfortable kitchen presented a scene of confusion, blood, and disorder, that was sickening to behold. He, himself, managed to come out of the fight with a whole skin, and not all the rough allusions of those who had come there, determined on bloody deeds on their inoffensive neighbors, could rouse Cameron's sluggish blood to fighting heat. One by one they departed, some of them in a state of beastly intoxi- cation. Cameron was as good as his word. CEarly next day he repaired to Captain Mackenzie, and swore informations against Cormac Rogan and the two Mullans. He fur- ther averred, that, empowered by a warrant from Col. Barber, of Belfast, he, "Duncan Cameron, gentleman,  \ well known for his loyalty to His Majesty's government, *   5i   TTHE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, did, at a certain time, call upon Cormac Rogan, and de- mand peaceable admission to search the premises of said Rogan for fire-arms; that while so engaged, was fired up- on by said Cormac Rogan, or otthers within his place; and further, it is the belief of informant, and of others by whom he was accompanied, that Rogan's house is used as a rendezvous by members of the organization known by the name of United Irishmen; and that said Cormac Rogan is assisted by two men, named John iullan and Peter Mullan, who are said to act in the capacity of ser- vants to the delinquent Rogan, but who are well known to belong to a rebel party. All of which is true as depo- nent saith, on the Holy Evangelists." In the middle of his triumph, Cormac and the Mul- lans were summoned to appear at the petty'sessions, held in Antrim, to account for the refusal of admission to Cameron, who, by law, was entitled to enter the widow's house and ransack it in the search, and burn it to the ground, if that were considered advisable by Cam- eron, or by any of those by whom he was accompanied. Three days must elapse before Cormac and the 3lul- lans would be called on to appear, and in that time Mr. Milliken was to revisit the Randalstown District. Pat Dolan's advice to Cormac was to make no arrange- ments, nor decide on anything, until Mr. Milliken was advised of the whole affair. This arrangement was assented to by Cormac ; but he could not help thinking of the terrible injustices to which he was subjected by that man Cameron.   i "Should he cross my path before that day," said Cor- mac, "I'm afraid he won't appear in good trim after- wards." "I would prefer making his acquaintance first," said John Mullan, with great bitterness. "For my part, I won't even attempt to seek him; but, if by chance he comes in my way, I won't promise that rll kindly inquire after his health. a.*   THE Pu K EMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      57 More trouble! Times get darker, and the poor perse- cuted people cannot see ihe end. They have a sort of dreamy and uncertain knowledge, that the time is not far distant when they will be required to meet their foes in open warfare. They had hoped and hoped again for aid from France. Their bold leader had made a full and perfect declaration or report to the French Directory in their behalf. In that report, Wolfe Tone pointed out conclusively the unhappy and degraded position of the Irish Catho- lics, as compared with zthe adherents of the Protestant Establishment. At lthe time when Wolfe Tone drew up his report, i there were in Ireland over three millions of Catholics, not near half a million Protestants, and about nine hundred thousand Presbyterians and Dissenters. A little study into these figures, and into the state of serfdom  in which the Catholics of that period were plunged, will go far to form a correct estimate of the peo- ple's minds, and to account for any extravagance of opinions which they held, or for the performaice of any acts, either by way of retaliation or otherwise, which they performed. Wolfe Tone succeeded in his efforts, and- the Fiench lEepublic sent to aid the cause of Irish independence a fleet consisting of forty-three sail, of which seventeen were line-of-battle ships, and thirteen frigates of thirty-six guns; the rest were transports. On board this fleet was a force of almost fifteen thousand soldiers, veterans of four campaigns, all under the com- mand of the young and gallant Hoche, one of the great- est Generals of the time, and a genuine Republican be- sides, and a sincere and attached friend of Ireland and her cause. For the second time, England was saved by the treach- erous winds of the channel. That splendid fleet and army of soldiers were driven about by storms around' the coast, until the vessels were separated from each other and obliged to return to Brest.   58    THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, CHAPTER 'Vill. A MO'TB'EliS ADVICE TO HER SON TO SERVE HS COUitrBY -CORIMAC ROGANr AVOWS HS LOVE FOR lKATE O'NRiTT, -  ATE9S ACCEPTANCE OF CORMB-AC- CORMACUS ARREST AND STBSEQUENT RESCUE. !" 'Tis love that murmurg in my breast, And. makes me shed the secret tear; Nor day, nor night my heart has rest, For night and day his voice I hear." THE day before Cormac's required appearance at court, Israel Milliken was true to his appointment. When made acquainted with the state of matters, he strongly advised th6 removal of Cormac to another part of the country. "C There was no use," he said, " in walking right into the lion's den. There was no justice to be had, and, for a certainty, Cormac would be imprisoned." Milliken detailed several instances that had just occur- red in'Belfast, where parties were flung into prison, some after the mockery of a trial, and others without any trial at all. To be suspected was sufficient, and the Govern- ment did these things in order to outrage the people, and drive them into the commission of acts that would enable the authorities, with some show of reason on their part, to treat the people with any amount of- harshness. About one hundred men were present at this meetinig, and the unanimous voice of the whole was, that Cormac Rogan, and his trusty companions, Peter and John Mul- lan, should retire from that part of the country, at least for some time, until better advice was had as to the fu- ture course they should adopt.,   THE PTKFCMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      59 The brothers at once consented; but Cormae, still be- lieving that some remnant of justice existed in the coun- try, and especially not liking to part from his mother, appeared obstinate. "Your mother shall receive every attention," said honest Pat, "and nothing shall be want- ing on the farm, that kindly hearts and hands can do. I'll guarantee that much." Cormac consented, and Israel Milliken promised thiat all three should accompany him on his visit to Newry, where the county delegates were to meet. Next day, Cormac's mother was made acquainted with this arrange- ment, and to the young man's pleasurable surprise, she uttered a hearty " thank God." It was the very thing she most desired. "Go, my son," she said; " and what- ever your country demands of you, do it with your whole heart and soul. Kate O'Neill shall visit me often during your absence, and both of us will pray that every bless- ing mnay attend you; and as for the brave fellows who go with you, they have my blessing and prayers, and should I be spared to live to see you all again, this will be their home as long as they choose." Cormac's heart was relieved. He felt that he was a different man, and, after embracing his mother, left the place to pay a visit to Father John and Miss O'Neill. The latter had received intimation of Cormac's resolve. When Cormac arrived at the place, Father John was absent. Kate received him with every mark of kindness. "And so you are about to leave us for awhile, Cormac?" she said. "Yes; I came to say as much, and to bid you good- by. But how did you learn the news so soon? I should not like to have it travel so fast." "Oh, never miad that. My informant, poor fellow, knows well wlhat he's about."- "ike Glinty?" said Cormao. "The same," replied Kate.   60    TH' IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, Cormac was satisfied. "' There is no use, Kate, trying to mince matters," said the young man; "I came here expressly to learn your mind concerning myself." "You have my good wishes, Cormac," said Kate, while she busied herself in the performance of some unimpor- tant duties. "I guessed as much, from the evening we walked to- gether, after meeting accidentally at the old toll-bar. But I require more than that. I am just now about to commit myself partly to an unknown course, and I wish to know if I occupy any higher position in your regard than that of mere ordinary friendship? ' Kate hung her head; her face was almpost colorless. Cormac took both her hands in his. "One word, Kate," he continued; 'I have loved you since we were children; I could not mention the exact time when that love for you entered my heart. The greater my love for you, the better I became, and more dearly was I beloved by my mother. Say, have I a place in your affections-do you return my love, Kate?" The dear girl brightened up, as if some happy train of thoughts had just then Winged their course through her pure, unsullied mind, while, with a warmth that aston- ished Cormac no less than herself, she answered: "Yes, Cormac, I love you with a whole and undivided love." And Kate bent forward to meet the happy kiss that Cor- mac joyously imparted. "You know nothing, I presume, of the'time of your return?" asked Kate. "Nothing whatever," replied Cormac; "I am advised to leave quickly, and will not see Vrou again until some change has leen effected, that will deprive Cameron of the power to injure me." "I trust in God, Cormac, that, no matter what happens, you will keep yourself pure in His sight, nor deign to commit an act that your conscience disapproveas' said the noble-hearted girl.   THE PTKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      61 ' My dear Kate, whatever may be in store for me, rely upon it, no dishonor will attach to my father's name. The avowal of your love shall be to me a strong incen- tive to virtue and to patriotism. I trust to the prompt- ings of your good heart to visit my amother as often as possible. She expects as much; and my dear girl will be a comfort and a solace to her during my absence. I am afraid I must take my leave without the sad pleasure of saying good-by to Father John." "Oh! no, no," said K;ate," you must not go till he comes back. He won't be long, Cormac, and he would be very much annoyed at not seeing you before you left." "He is aware of my intention, I suppose," said Cormac. "He is, and approves of it highly; but did not think j you would leave till to-night."  At that moment, a loud noise was heard at the door, and a voice in command, shouting--" ground arms," too plainly revealed the danger in which Cormac stood. The young man looked wildly around him, but saw no means of escape. Kate trembled from head to foot, and became as pale as death. In a few seconds, Captain Mackenzie and three men entered. "Secure your prisoner," roared out the captain. Cormac was instantly laid hold of, and his hands se- curely tied behind his back. One piercing scream of anguish from Kate, and the poor girl fell fainting at the feet of her lover. Cormac's heart was like to break. -The hot blood was coursing madly through his veins. He was entrapped just at the very moment when the influence of his be- loved Kate was moulding his mind for future action. The whole current of his feelings became changed, and, had he the power, he would have slain the four men who stood before him. "Proceed," said Mackenzie, and he pointed to the door. Kate clung to her lover with a gripe like death. She   62    THE IRiSH WioOW'S SON; OR, was insensible, and Cormac could not move a step with- out hurting her. The poor fellow begged that one of the men would lift her and place her in a seat. "6Do time for scenes like this," said one of the gang, in the most brutal manner; and he caught the girl by the waist and dragged her away, leaving her still lying on the floor. When just on the point of leaving, Father John entered. Cormac felt inclined to turn away his head, but the old pastor came close to him and gave him his blessing, bidding him be of good heart. His voice faltered as he spoke. Cormac directed his attention to Kate, and the brave fellow was marched off a prisoner. Turning a sharp point on the road, Mackenzie, who was a little in advance, was observed to raise his musket; but before he had time to comprehend his position, he and his follow- ers were surrounded by a party of men, about a dozen in number. Cormac was instantly unbound, and, quick as the spring of the tiger, he dealt the ruffian who insulted Kate a blow that laid him prostrate. One of the party of unknown friends-Cormac did not know a man of them-seeing the spring of the young man at his oppo- nent, judging that he had good cause for what he did, kicked the brute until he groaned. "Villains," roared Mackenzie "you shall answer for this with your lives." "- Another word," said a man, who appeared to be the leader, " and your brains will be at your feet." -Mackenzie and his party were instantly disarmed, and permitted to go their way. Cormac's rescuers remained until the others were out of sight, then breaking up into twos and threes, took different routes across the country.   THE PT!KITEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       63 CH0APTER IX.

INETTTITGOENCE A was at once conveyed to Cormacts mother; also to Father McAuley and Kate, that immedi- ately after leaving the house he was bravely rescued, I and that he had the hearty satisfaction of striking to the earth the ruffian who assaulted his beloved Kate. Israel Milliken was almost ubiquitous at times. He was here, and there, and everywhere. Men seemed to spring out of the earth at his command. He had gone through a good schooling, in consequence of the acci- dents which happened to many of his friends, by not being sufficiently cautious and guarded in the presence of those who would not believe in the treachery of Newell and Hughes, the two Belfast informers. Milli- ken, as he used to boast of it, could raise from twenty to a hundred men in as many minutes, for a distance of thirty miles, in any direction from Belfast. He heard without the least surprise that Mackenzie was seen hurrying toward the chapel, and guessing that the party could not be engaged in any work, especially when armed, at that time of day, instantly hastened to   "   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, the spot, gathering assistance' as he went. Standing behind a hedge with his men, he gave them instructions how to act rightly, guessing that Cormac was the prize sought for by Mackenzie. It cannot be denied, that those who were known by the name of Defenders, were often guilty of acts of ag- gression. It is not to be wondered at, when we remem- ber that the state of Ireland, at that period, was such that those who could not or .would not fight, were sure to lose all they posesssed. When the charge of a district was given to., or voluntarily undertaken by, a party of Defenders, it sometimes happened, nay, it was a thing of common occurrence, that while engaged in the de- fence of one place, probably some poor widow's dwelling- house (for the Wreckers were generally very brave when they had none to contend against but women and chil- dren), three or four places would be destroyed in some other part of the country. If the Defenders believed that they were able to hold their own in any townland, tey were not slow, some- times, to act by way of retaliation; and many unneces- sary acts of cruelty were perpetrated by them at times. Without becoming their apologist, I can safely affirm of them, that they never acted cruelly towards a weak party, nor injured anything belonging to the poor. What- ever they did in this way, was eithler to overawe some des- pot in authority, like Mackenzie and his satellites, or avenge themselves on those who were able to bear their attacks. That night, as Tilliken, Cormac!Rogan, and Peter and John Mullan were on their way to \ Newry, the sky-was lit up by the glare of a conflagration, in the direction of Cameron's house. On approaching it, it became evident that the whole premises was one mass of flames. Not a soul was within sight. Cameron was distracted. He ran about in the wildest manner, shouting, and calling   'THE PIKEMEN OF NINE TY-E1IGHT.      65 for aid. Most of the farm servants were absent; a strong wind was blowing at the time, and the agony- of Camer- on's mind was intense. The sight of the flames attracted some of his friends to the spot. Three men arrived only to add to the madness of Cam- eron. All, were powerless to act, the supply of water was small, buckets and ladders were few, and almost useless; the barn, which was stored in the upper loft with grain, was like the interior of a kiln. To add to the horror of the scene, the haggard was in a blaze, either by the hand  of an incendiary, or by burning material alighting on the corn stacks from the surrounding build- ings. One man placed a short ladder against the wall of the barn, while another handed him a few buckets of water. Such attempts appeared only to increase the flames. When stretching himself, in order to reach a certain part of the fire, he fell and dislocated his shoulder. He lay there shouting for help; but Cameron called on the man who was handing him the water to come quick-  1y withl the ladder to another part of the building, so that the unfortunate man was left to shift for himself. The fire burned fiercer and brighter, and drove back the few who attempted to stay its ravages. By degrees, more help arrived on the spot; but Cameron could not avail himself of the services of his friends. They were too late arriving; the fire had gained complete, mastery, and there he stood, a prey to the fire that raged no less fiercely within his breast. That night, Cameron's whole place was one mass of ruins! No second thought regarding its origin seemed to en- ter the minds of those who witnessed the disaster.  i None but the bloody Wreckers could, or would, have dared to commit such an act, and yet those who were blamed had nothing whatever to do with the business.   "   'thiel IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, Even as an act of retaliation, it never entered their minds. Was it caused by accident, or, had some hand secretly, but surely, applied the brand? We shall see. Pat Dolan was busy in the smiddy. Phil and Ned, and some extra hands, were there at work, and Mike Glinty, in order to earn the retard of a good supper, and leave to stop all night in the smiddy, had been posted outside of doors to anmuse himself, and, at the same time, to an- nounce the arrival of any stranger coming that way. Several times, Mike came into the smiddy to warm' him- self, and, as his entrance always caused a cessation of work, and the concealment of. curious shaped pieces of iron, Pat ordered him to take out a few sods of turf and make a little fire for himself down in a hollow of the ditch, at the place where he was to keep himself station- ed. Mike did so, and, for some little time, enjoyed his small comfort merrily enough. "Nin-nin-nobody comin' here," said Mike to himself. "( Mike roast some pip-pip-potatoes for himself ;" and he did so, not having far to go to obtain what he required. During his preparation of a meal after this fashion, a practice that he often indulged in, and not a bad one either, according to the poor fellow's philosophy, he be- gan to ruminate on the possibility of burning Cameron in his bed that night. As a sharp breeze sprung up, Mike rubbed his hands with glee, and cackled, and laughed, at the strangeness of the ideas that took pos- session of him. He wished it were cdarker, and soon his wishes were fully realized. The night fell as dark and as black as night ere fellbefore. Mike lifted two or three  half-burned sods of turf, and covered the burning parts over with a thick coat of ashes. After. glancing around him-not to try to see if he was observed, but to fulfil his contract with Pat Dolan-he stole qUickly, away over the fields, in a manner that, few 'could equal. Shortly   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       67 he arrived at Cameron's, and, after pacing about in all directions, he climbed on the top of a water-barrel that stood close to the barn door, and instantly flung .the burning sod into the middle of the building. His acts were like those of a well-trained Indian, so noiselessly, and, at the same time, so adroitly did he carry out his plans. Another brand was safely stowed away into a corn-stack, at the rear of the haggard; then he retired a short distance to see if any one appeared. Shortly, he crept round to the back of the main building, and mount- ing the same ladder that had been used in the attempt to extinguish the flames, he thrust the burnings coal in the spot most likely to succeed in setting the whole fab- ric in a flame. After removing the ladder to what he 'believed a place of concealment, the natural walked quietly but slowly away. Several times he turned around .to witness the effect of his design, and not see- ing any result, he sat down on a big stone to wait awhile, planning all the time in his mind, that, when next he tried to pay Cameron in his own coin, he would make surer of his business. As Mike arose to leave, he saw a flash burst out of a side door, in thie barn; then came a thick volume of smoke; another, from the roof of the dwelling-house, soon convinced him of the success of his work, and instantly he sped across the fields, back to his old spot. The remains of his own little fire were a lot of warm ashes, which he scattered with a kick Of his foot; then rushing into the smiddy, his wild and excited manner alarmed those within, who, without waiting for one word of explanation, caused them to damp the fires at once. In two minutes the place was in utter dark- ness, and all had retired, Mike along with them, never dreaming that his appearance had caused them to thus leave off. Well was it they did so I During Mike's temporary absence, one of Mackenzie's      68   -'nE IRISH, WIDOW'S SON; OR, yeos, who had been specially sent for the purpose, ap- proached unobserved to Pat's smiddy, and, withihis open eyes, beheld the unconstitutional work of pike-making going on. The man happened to be a stranger to that particular locality, but he soon managed to return and give information to his party. Five men, together with Mackenzie, instantly accompanied him. He knew not the names of the places he passed through, but that made little difference, he being selected for his mission. ?    on account of his being a stranger, so that if observed, he was likely to pass unnoticed. After walking for a con- siderable distance, Mackenzie got to be uneasy; his in- formant seemed restless as he led the men near to every house where a bright light appeared. There they were, marchivng and counter-marching, wandering here and there, and repeatedly going over the same ground three and four times. Mackenzie's temper was evidently sorely tried, but the chance of finding out where pikes were manufactured was too good a thing to lose, at a time when the govern- ment was showering golden rewards on all who assisted to crush down the rising power of the United Irishmen. They kept at it bravely. The square indicated by the four houses referred to in another chapter, was the - favorite ground for the informant. He felt, he knew, he was near to the place; but where had the house gone to? O;L! he must be altogether astray! He half-acknow- led'ge'd-as much, and so the search continued. "Ha! yonder it is; see the lights from here," said the fellow. Mackenzie looked in the direction pointed out. "Hurry on, boys," said the chief; and they did hurry, and finally reached Cameron's house as the last few flickers escaped from the ruins. Cameron was first to recognize Mackenzie. Never thinking but the latter had come specially to give assistance, and to protect the house, Cameron half-yelled out: "Time for you to arrive." "What's the matter? My God! what is this "   THS PTKEIMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      69 "Don't you see what it is; are you blind?" said Cam- eron. "My whole place gone--burned to the ground- turned into a hell! ruin, devastation! and all through the agency of your confounded papishes!" exclaimed Camer- on, like a man thoroughly bereft of his senses. "/ How? By whoal ? Explain?" said Mackenzie; and all that was known was soon told. Bewilderment would but ill express the state of mind into which all were thrown by the appearance of the place. Cameron seated himself on the stile opposite , where the door of his comfortable house had stood a few hours before. - His face was blackened and burned. Those who assisted him   where in a similar plight. There stood the smouldering haggard, the ruins of house and barn, roof-trees burning and crackling, fitful flashes of flame starting up here and there, wherever the devour- ing element got hold of anything it had not previously reached. Nothing could exceed the horrible appearance of al1 around. The Dorrians were avenged; yes, cruelly and fatally avenged by, the hands of an idiot, who looked upon his work with grim satisfaction, and was just then wonder- ing in his mind if Pat Dolan had known what he was engaged at, and likely to refuse him his supper and leave to sleep in the smiddy in consequence of his act.  Mackenzie and his troop forgot for the time 'what had brought them  there. In vain he endeavored-to get one reasonable word from Cameron.   He .fi'My believed all he heard: that a party of Defendersli 'AvLs- ited the place, and committed all the ruin he beheld. Those who came first to the assistance of Camieron, told all they knew. Cameron was sitting at his fireside, sud- denly a glare of light shot in through the kitchen win- dow. tie'rushed out to learn the cause, and there he beheld the barn on fire. He attempted to suppress the fie, but all his efforts were unavailing. Instantly the l   70    THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; -OR haggard became covered with a thick cloud of black smoke; then arose a flame, bright and strong from the roof of his dwelling. He became panic-stricken, as did those also who hurried to assist him. Finally, he gave up all hope, and could only stand a witness to the devas- tation that fell around him. Mackenzie's men were ordered to retire homeward. ;,   u "It was now apparent," he said, " that every man '* Ad: should guard his own place as best he could. If the :; . government did not instantly strengthen his hands, that i ? part of the country would soon be laid in ruins." : -    He endeavored to get Cameron with him, but the in- fatuated man could not leave the place. He seemed rooted to the spot, as if by some fatality. Mackenzie called some of those around to his aid, and literally car- ried the afflicted man away.

"Is there no call, no consecrating cause, Approved by Heaven, ordained by nature's laws, Where justice flies, the herald of our way, And truth's pure beams upon the banners play?"

"Th-th-they're. all did-did-dam-ned bib-bib-by this time," said poor Mike, totally unconscious of Pat's dis- pleasure. "Why, what the devil do you mean, you stuttering jackass?" said Pat, enraged. "Nin-nin-no jack-k-k-ass," said Mike, also roused. "Come, now, you haVe spoiled my patience, as well as spoiled some work. What made you rush into the smiddy, in the manner you did?" "Tit-tit-tit-to tell you--" "Sing it, sing it out," said Pat, rising from his seat.

"Quite right," said Ned Dolan. "' Father, poor Mike is hungry and cold; let's get him some supper.2 And Mike was accordingly provided with all that his capacious stomach required. He very soon explained the whole thing to the utter bewilderment of all who heard him. He maintained that he felt called upon to do the work, from the day the Dorrians left the place. His narrative BI was a strange mixture of his belief, that he was bound to do what he did; that he was favored by the darkness of the night, and that his work was blessed with success; that the wind kept urging him on to his work, saying, every now and again, "Hurry, Mike, good fellow, hurry." Pat Dolan saw at once the effect which all this would have upon the place. Inwardly he rejoiced at the fate that befell the thief of the Dorrians' property, and thought he could perceive something like a retributive - vengeance in the act of the foolish Mike, whom he half regarded that moment with feelings of something akin to affection. Mike perceived the good looks of Pat return- ing, and being satisfied with his meal, asked Pat didn't he do right. 1 rl tell you some other time," said Pat. It was nothing strange for those who knew poor Glinty to take all he said for truth. He never told a lie; never ;    dissembled; always believing that whatever he did, he was bound to do; and thinking that all who knew him were secretly engaged in punishing the Camerons of the country, he imagined that his duty was to assist his friends in some way or another.

His intimate knowledge of his own part of the country was most valuable. He knew the place, and the people; those who were likely to msake them- selves useful,those who were likely to join them, and those who were in all probability to be their enemies. "You will probably know some of the Kiellys and Iaq gills of 3agheralane?" said MicCracken to Cormac. "Yes, I know nearly every family of them; in fact, I know all of that name in the place you mention." "What is your opinion of them?" "The Magills I don't like, although I cannot give you any specific reason for my dislike of them. The Kiellys are few in number, and not remarkable for one thing or another. There are several families of the Macolorys- honest, fine people. They don't seem to care much, about those whom you have mentioned, and it -is prob- ably on account of their dislike, that I dislike them also,9 said Cormac, in the most ingenuous manner. i You will also know something of the people of Fee- nagh?" asked Neilson. "That," replied Cormac, "is a fine place. My two friends here, Peter and Jack Mullan, were born there, I tlhink, and I believe they know more about that place than I do." "Not better families, sir, to be found in the North of Ireland,' said John Mullan. "That's because the O'Haras came from that quarter,' whispered Peter to'Cormac. "You will know the O'Boyles, probably," suggested McCraclken. "Yes, sir, I know the- whole of them; some of them are married in the families of the O'EKanes and the Don- nellys.' - "Quito right," said Henry Joy MeCraelen, who seemed Tl Crl./PiX T04r;ALT hcr  JoSMrch o y r   74    THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "Excuse us for a few minutes, said the last speaker, as he and Samuel Neilson retired to speak to each other privately. 4"I knew Rogan's father well," said MeCracken.

I'm afraid, however, that that idiot of a soldier, Sandy, has ferretted out who he is,9 said Neilson. "I don't think so. But suppose he has, Israel can keep clean scores with all such." ' Does Mr. Porter know Rogan, do you think?" "Not to my knowledge; but if we make out the young fellow's credentials, it will be all right.' , "Or, wait till they return from Newry? ' - "No at once; it will assist them there.? Cormac was called in, and shortly afterwards insluct- ed in a new line of duty. He was appointed leigate for the districts of Ballygrooly, Magheralane, MXag- hereagh, and Feenagh. Under the direction of Millilen he was to proceed at once on duty. His instructions were to keep a sharp eye on Mackenzie, to watch every movement he made, and to report to headquarters im- mediately everything he considered of importance. He would return from Newry in a few days. His chief bus- iness there, was to see other delegates, to become ac- quainted with them, and to produce the credentials then given to him. Meantime, he was to have the brothers Mullan near to him, to engage them in whatever way seemed best suited to hin; and, if found necessary, to entrust either one or other of them as .secret envoys to Belfast, in case of any emergency arising in his part of the country. Cormac felt elated, and promised obedience to all the - instructions given him.   THE PIKieMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       75 After speaking with the brothers, in the presence of McCracken, Neilson, and Milliken, the latter and his party started at once for the office of the stage-coach, from which they proceeded to their -appointed place. Milliken was well acquainted with the driver, and hired outside seats for himself and companions. When fairly started on the road, Israel, who had se- cured a seat beside the driver, entered into a long con- verslation with Cormac, as to the necessity of his pru- dent management of affairs, enrolment of soldiers for the army of United Irishmen, and the cultivation of a feeling of brotherly love among those of different reli- gious persuasions. A few hours brought the stage-coach to a place called Hillsborough, at which horses were clhanged- About a mile before leaching the "Head Inns," 'there fresh horses were in  readiness, all the travellers dismounted from  their seats to walk up the hill, through the town. The demesne of the Downshire family are situated here, the entrance to which was guarded by a body of yeomanry. To this day the same practice exists, and a more ludicrous sight is not easily seen, than five or six of the Downshire yeos, dressed like parish beadles, sauntering about the entrance to the Castle. They are old men, mostly the sons of '98 yeos. They are dressed with cocked hats, large white rollers of cotton cloth round their necks, plush breeches, swal- low-tailed coats, profusely embroidered vests, that be- speak capacious stomachs, white stockings, that from their thinness betray the padded calves, and shoes with large antique buckles. It was a common practice for the guards of this noble mansion to get into conversation with passengers on their route to Dublin, and other towns on that line. Milliken instructed his companions on this m:atter, Cormac and himself were peddlers, John    and Peter were farm servants. All were to appear to be good and   7 6   T 1aT IRISH  WIDOW'S SON; On, loyal people, and no matter wh'at sentiments were heard uttered in their presence, they were to remain quiet; or, if they did speak, to join in with all that was said. Peo- ple who "knew the road," were sensible of the necessity of this line of conduct, for Hillsborough was remark-, able for many a scene of bloodshed in those days. After the tiresome walk up the steep hill, and the ap- petite generated by the drive through the fresh coun- try air, the passengers betook themselves at once to the large room, where the comfort of a good fire awaited them. Refreshments were loudly called for, and shortly a spirit of hilarity became prevalent among the fellow- travellers. The bar-room was thronged by the yeoman- ry, who were anxious to learn if anything stirring was taking place in Belfast. "Any news from your quarter?"' asked one of the yeos, addressing 3fillilren. "Which quarter do you mean?" inquired our friend. "Belfast," said the yeoman. "I don't belong to that place," said Milliken. "Do you, young man?", inquired the same speaker, addressing Cormac. "No, sir," said Rogan, rather emphatically. "There is some news," said one of the passengers, joining the company. "Some bad news, too, as far as I can learn." "Let's hear," said the yeoman. "Col. Barber has been applied to for forces from Bel- fast, to be stationed at Antrim, Randalstown, and dis- tricts." Cormac and Israel became attentive listeners, but neither gave the slightest indication of any particular interest in the conversation. A slight tinge of red was- visible on Cormac's cheek. Hiilliken's keen eye observed this; the others were not so attentive. "Regular forces?" said the yeoman. Regulars and yeomanry both,' said the stranger,   THE PIKEMiEN OF NllNETY-EII6T.     " "Any report of disturbances about those places?" was the next inquiry. "Nothing but the burning and laying in ruins of every bones, man's property," replied Israel Mfiliken's fellow-traveller. Do you mean the property of those who are trying to save the country from the horrors of a civil war?" asked the yomnan, who evidently appeared to be above the ordinary grade of those of his class. "I mean the property of mlean who won't be dared into the acknowledgment of any treason against the crown Or sovereign of these realms, replied the stranger, Quite so; that's what I mean, also." "The report to-day is, that a gentleman named Dun- can Canmeron, had his house, barn, and haggard com- pletely destroyed." "Cameron, did you say?" asked John Mullan. "Yes; that's the name, I believe." Milliken gave a glance at Mullan, and drawled out: Bad, very bad, indeed!" "Diarmled bad," said the yeoman, excitedly. "I tell you what it is, my friends," he 'said, addressing the party, " our government thinks itself very wise, and very cute; but the fact is this: it is onlyallowing matters to go to a certain head, thinking to crush them whenever it appears necessary; but the same government will very likely find itself mistaken, before long, and then they'll wish that they had taken active steps before this." "Quite right; quite right," said Israel. "If I only  had the chance," said the other, "I'd very "Take your places, take your places," roared out the guard of the mail-coach. There was a general rush of the travellers. The sthange gentleman was an  inside passenger.  He nodded in a friendly manner to Israel. The latter was no sooner seated beside the driver, with Cormac on the opposite         .   ..,   78   THE  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, side, and Peter and John behind, than instantly he in- quired: "Who is that fellow with the drab vest, Darby? There are two ladies with him, I think." "' Whisht,." said the driver; " that's the devil!" and he made the whip give forth a loud crack as he spoke. "And his name?" inquired Israel. "'Beelzebub," said Darby. Milliken could not help laughing at the appearance of Darby, as he used the -ord. "ML ister Beelzebub, I call him," said Darby; "when I'm speaking to myself, or to a friend, and when nobody else hears me." "I saw him before, somewhere," said .Milliken, and for the life of me I cannot call to recollection, this mo- ment, where I did see him." "You saw him in the Star Inn, in Belfast," said Darby, "the night you were nearly nailed." "What, Murdoch! '" asked Israel, evidently alarmed. "The same," replied Darby. "Mister Murdoch, the friend and companion of Mister Newell. God bless the purty pair o' them, over the left," said the driver. "Pull up suddenly whenever you pass McShane's, about five or six miles beyond Loughbrickland,!' said Milliken. "All right; I know your ground," answered Darby. Cormac's mind was evidently "ill at ease" since he heard the- news about Cameron. Peter and John, the latter especially, felt rejoiced, but neither of them divin- ed the right cause of the burning of Cameron's prem- ises. Peter ascribed it to Pat Dolan. John said, "that was all stuff." He would lay his life that some of the O'Haras had a hand in the work. As the darkness increased, the conversation began to lag, and but little transpired among our party until the journey's end was reached. The driver pulled up quickly, and Israel Milliken and his party dismounted, without any notice being taken of them.   THE PIKEM[EN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      79 CHTAPTER XN. A CON VJaSATION BETWEEEN FATHER JOHN AND KATE-- KATE VISITS WIDOW ROGAN'S--MEETS BRIGID O'HABA. -WHAT THEY DID AND WHAIT THEY SAID. '"Still do your happy souls attune The notes they learned on earth to move; Still breathing o'er the chords, commune In sympJathies of angel love."  IT was a bitter cold night, as Father John McAuley drew his arm-chair closer to the fire, and desired Kate to come and sit beside him. Kate obeyed; and having provided herself with some needle-work, for Kate was master of that humble but essential little article, the needle, took her place beside her uncle, in a cheery and light-hearted manner. She had made her uncle acquainted with the details of her inter- view with Cormac, omitting the little episode of the rat- ification of what transpired at said interview. "Kate, my good girl," said Father John, "you were anxious to know if I 'was pleased with your conversation with Cormac Rogan, and with his conduct in addressing you as he did. I am quite pleased; or, rather, I ampartly indifferent. I must tell you, however, that you did well to mention to me  all about it. I never fail in telling others, when I  consider they have done right. iI Ipok upon it, my  child, as much of a duty to point out what pleases me, and to show my appreciation of good con- duct, as to warn against errors, and condemn improprije     8[0   THL IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OE, ties, and graver faults. It is a mistake, Kate, to withhold praise when really due. It is an incentive to do better still; and the father, mother, or friend, who feels pleased, and inwardly rejoices at some good or brave act of a child, companion, or friend, and who fails to notice that , which pleases them, commit a great mistake." "Many years/ago" replied lKate, "I observed you, dear uncle, earleavor to establish that fact in the minds of your people. I did not properly understand your meaning, for I was just returned from Miss O'Hara's school. But the lesson seemed to grow on me, as it were, and since I came to properly understand the goodness of your motives, I have felt it as necessary to open my mind to you on matters wherein I was to blame, as on things the reverse." "That was the point I aimed at, and therein lies the true 'germ of education. I was proud to see it so beautifully exemplified in the conduct of Cormac's mother. That woman, dear Kate, knows more of real education than many of those who take upon them- selves the performance of such a duty." "That, perhaps, is the secret of my regard for her?' - . "Might you not just as easily have said love for her, and been nearer the truth?" This was a sharp, practical hit on the subject both were talking on. IKate acknowledged that her uncle was right. "And therefore," he said, "comes the great necessity of speaking out really what we think, under such circum- stances as these." c( But would it be wise to use such freedom with those whom we actually do love?" asked Kate. "Why ask such a question, after the plain matter-of- fact interview with Cormac??" said Father John. "You know;' he continued, " if you were in presence of Widow Rogan, and spoke of the-*egard you had for her, she   THE PIKEMEEN OF. NINETY-EIGHT.     81 would probably speak of her regard for you, and you would not feel at your ease. But if you spoke of the love you bear to her, her own instincts would rightly lead her to know that your love for her arose from your love for her son." Kate acknowledged the full force and truth of what her uncle said; but expressed her unwillingness to treat everyone alike, and openB proclaim her likes and dis- likes in their presence. "That is not at all necessary, my dear girl. You are quite right in what you have said. Your own good sense, and the unerring instincts of your nature, will always prompt you, when necessary, as to the sort of person to whom you should speak the honest truthful- ness of your mind. For instance, I don't think you would speak to a person of the regard you have for me." "No, dear uncle, I could only speak of the warm- hearted love I bear to you," said Kate, with an. anima- tion that bearned from her eyes, and lighted up her face with a radiant beauty. "I knew that," said the priest, and his iuee shone with pleasure, "while on the other hand you would never dream  of telling everyone who mentioned Cormao Rogan's name in your presence, and perhaps inquired what you thought of him, to say instantly -that you loved him."3 "Then we are as one on such matters?" said Kate. "I should think so, my child." "But you did not tell me yet, uncle, if I have your sanction for what I have done?"  "You did nothing wrong; and some other time I shall speak on this subject to you again. I suppose you understood me in the proper way when I mentioned Cormac's name to you on Christmas day?" Kate replied that she knew the spirit and meaning of her uncle's words on that CoapSion. 6   82   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "I am in great doubt but that the burning of Came- ron's place will be laid to the charge of Cormac, in con- sequence of all that has happened,' said Kate, with a tremor in her voice. "I am of the same opinion," said her uncle. "Circum- stances all point to him; and thus we learn how easy it is to fall into errors and mistakes in our judgment.." "And do you think the government will not use every exertion to trace his whereabouts, and arrest him?" in- quired Kate, quite nervously. "I have not the slightest doubt but they will, neither have I the slightest belief that they will succeed." Kate thanked her uncle warmly for this assurance. She had great, almost implicit, faith in his judgment, so true it is that we desire to believe what others say in whatever concerns us most. Next morning, Kate paid a visit to Widow Rogan's, and was a little, just a little nonplussed, to find charm- ing Brigid O'Hara there before her. There was nothing wrong in Brigid's presence, but then-aye, but then, Kate, speak out, and don't forget last night's conversa- tion with uncle! Well-yes; go on. Brigid is John's sweetheart, and 'Kate is Cormac's, and both the young men lived in this same house, and Mrs. Rogan is Cormac's mother, and knows something about Jack Mullan, and Brigid often laughed at the mistake between Peter :llan and herself. Peter had disclosed the whole affaiiine night, and nearly killed Widow Rogan and Cormac with his droll recital of it-and Kate would rather not have met Brigid just then. There- was something queer about it- However, there they were, both met under the one roof, and who knows but Cormac and John Mullan were un- der one roof, too, and perhaps just talking about these girls at that very moment; aye, who knows? And what matter if any one knew?   THE PTKI'EMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      83 Widow Rogan was heartily glad to see both the girls, both of whom began at once looking about them to see if there was any work to be done. There is no more excellent trait in the character of our Irish maidens than the one here alluded to. They make 'a visit to a friend's house, and before they are five minutes in the place, they look around to see what is going on, in order "to lend a hand," and this is done with such freedom and hearty good will, and so well performed, besides, that it would appear as if the work was indeed a labor of love. Should the " woman of the house" be ailing, should there be a sick child to occupy the mother's time arid attention, some neighbor is sure to "drop in," just in the nick of time to milk the cows to make supper for the" boys,' or do anything else that won't permit of delay. I have witnessed these things with the extremest sat- isfaction; and at a time when there is "trouble" in a house, perhaps a death, such acts of kindness, quietly performed in the most unobtrusive manner, win upon us and dignify our nature by the effect of their innate love- liness. Often, too, may be observed the maiden blush on the face of a young girl, if she thinks she is looked upon by some one with favor, in the performance of those valuable acts of kindness. It was natural, therefore, for both Kate and Brigid to look around the kitchen to observe if anything required to be done. But all was orderly, neat, and clean. The widow rightly interpreted their looks, and knowing that idleness was a negative point in their character, said-. "If you haveyour needles, girls, we'll take a spell at a new quilt I'm making." Out came the pincushion, and the needles withdrawn. They were soon seated at their work, and talked on everything but that which lay nearest the heart of feth. Cormac engrossed two-thirds of their thoughts, and     ,        .an   84   IxHiE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, John Mullan the other third. Whoever likes may an- alyze the problem for themselves, and find out the cause of the unequal division. The widow changed the conversation by alluding to the disturbed state of the country. The transition from that subject to those who were devoting their lives to their country's cause was easy and natural, "Sometimes I fancy that I will never see my son again," said the widow, who had scarcely spoken the words than she regretted having done so, for the blood came and went on Kate's cheeks in a manner which at once- showed the effectthey had on her. "The same thought crosses my mind about Jack," said Brigid, quite artlessly; " but my father says, ' there's no fear of him," and then I begin to think to myself he's just able enough to take his own part, no matter where he is," and Brigid gave her pretty head some- thing like a jerk; in fact, a saucy jerk, for the curls all shook responsive. Kate could not help smiling at this act of faith, so boldly pronounced by Brigid in regard to John Mullan. "Let us hope," she said, "'that nothing will happen to any of them." It is a sad duty that calls them forth, and forces them to take the steps they have taken. There was no resource left," she continued, " and they would have been less of men to simply wait until their doom was on them." "Ah! that's true, my dear Kate," said the widow. "That thought reconciled me to Cormac's absence. His poor father-Gpd rest his soul "-"Amen," said both girls in the one breath -- would just have acted in like man- ner. - I even question if he would have taken so long to deliberate." "Cormac was nothing the worse for deliberating,"' urged'Kate. "When anything is deserving of beingwell   THE PI KMEN    OF NINETY-EIGHT.   85 done, it is also deserving of being well considered before being undertaken."  Brigid laughed heartily at the remarks of Kate, for she gave a different interpretation to them than that which actuated the mind of the speaker. Kate looked up at her with some surprise, but Brigid only laughed again. "Let me explain," she said to Kate, and mind you mustn't be angry. I was just thinking that K1ate was nothing the worse for wisely deliberating within herself whether she would love Cormac Rogan, when her good little heart had given its consent before the deliberation commenced---" "There, that will do now, Brigid--. " "And then, when the heart had done its work well, Kate thought it was deserving of being better considered before the mutual contract would be undertaken"--and all three laughed, as much at the roguery beaming out of Brigid's eyes, as at the stranger metamorphosis of Kate's words and meaning. After spending a considerable part of the day with the widow, Kate returned. It was arranged before leav- ing, that Brigid was to obtain leave to remain for a few days in Widow Rogan's house, and Kate promised to make her visits as often as she could spare time for that purpose.   86   'TMH 1 IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, CFRAPTER XII.

The handle, of the best of ash, Is smooth, and straight, and strong." THE magistrates of the county of Antrim assembled in meeting a week after the burning of Cameron's house and offices, and issued a proclamation, in which 500 were offered as a reward for the conviction and prosecu- tion of those, or any of them, who were accessory to the incendiarism. Several additional districts were pro- claimed; but that proceeding was totally uncalled for, iin- asmuch as the soldiers and yeomanry had license to en- ter any dwelling, so long as the pretext of searching for arms was acted upon. The enrolment of members in the society of United Irishmen proceeded at a vigorous rate. Sometimes this was openly performed in broad day- light, and within a very short distance of the headquar- ters of both yeomanry and soldiers. The members were getting bolder and more defiant in their work every day. For many districts around Belfast, Carrickfergus, Larne, Saintfield, Ballinahinch, Antrim, Randalstown, Toome- bridge, and on toward Magherafelt and Cookstown, sev- eral influential gentlemen were fast joining the organ- ization, and, by aid of their large fortunes; supplying   THE PTIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      87. those who were too poor to provide themselves with arms and ammunition. Assistanee from France was looked for day after day; and many members of the Dublin Directory, depending too much on this aid, thwarted the designs of the more energetic, who held to the belief that they should rely upon their own exertions to further the cause that one and all had most at heart, The manufactur;e of pikes continued steadily on the increase, and large foraging parties were appointed throughout the country districts to lay the doneesnes of the large landed-proprietors under tribute, for the pro- vision of pike-handles. No small danger attended this description of work, as the shafts or handles were usually chosen from planta- tions where young ash trees most abounded. Pat Dolan, according to previous instruction, held- a meeting of one of those parties, consisting of about twenty men. Lord O'Neill's estate being the largest in the country, and being provided with the sort of sap- lings required, was selected as the rendezvous for Dolan's party.' A dozen of saws and hatchets were provided for the business, and, at the appointed hour, the men were on the ground, ready to proceed to work. About three hundred were required, and arrangements were made to proceed to a pretty little wood that sloped down toward the edge of Lough Neagh. Patrols were placed almost nightlyin those woods, and it was necessary that the utmost caution should be observed. Fleming, the understrapper, was often appointed to this work. He was provided with a guard, and all were heavily armed. It was a bright, moonlight night; the air was as still as in the cool delicious evenings of July;--the tall trees cast their shadows on the water, w]6Ll the moonbeams sported on the tiny waves. Nature was asleep.   88    THEi IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "A pleasant night for work, boys," said Pat, address- ing his followers, " if there was just a good breeze to disturb the branches." "The sound of the hatchet travels far, a night like this," said his son Phil. "Let us use the saws, and cut clean -through, without any breaking," said the father. Scouts were posted at proper distances, who were to give the signal at the approach of danger. They were also to travel from those who were engaged at the work, and learn at what distance the sounds ceased. One of these men returned hastily, and informed Pat that he saw four or five men, with muskets slung across their shoulders, moving in a direction to the left, where the men were at work. He could distinctly hear the sound of the branches crackling, and advised a cessation of the business. "We must continue the work this night, at every haz- ard," said Dolan. "I am bound to have the pikes in readiness for the Magheralin men, and some are to go down to Belfast and Lisburn in the hay and turfcarts, to-morrow." The words were scarcely out of Pat's mouth, when an- other scout came hastily forward, with word that men were coming that way. Instructions were given for the party to cease work, to divide, and lie down. That instant there was a flash of light, then the report of a gun, and five or six men were seen approaching in the direction of Dolan. Pat crept slowly backward. The report of the gun had set the wood astir with rooks, flying from tree to tree. This aided Pat's party, who, talking advantage of the noise, kept retreating into the thicker andtnser -part of the wood. Flemin Sg'^ t s he who led the party, saw where -^ several young tx ere recently cut down, and, know-   THrE PIKEMEN OF NINET7r-EIGHT.     89 ing that he had passed the same spot during the day, came at once to the conclusion that the depredators were then secreted in the wood. He did not see clearly what was best for him to do. There might be few, or many; and the result might be unpleasant to himself. Dolan kept his eye on the party, and watched every movement of Fleming. So far, all was going on well enough to Pat's satisfaction. He believed that Fleming had examined the place, and had probably thought to himself that, as the damage was done, the perpetrators had taken to flight. "I have that dog, Fleming, covered with my gun," said a voice to the right of Pat; and, before the latter could speak, the man fired. Fleming tottered against a tree, wounded in the leg. "Curses on you for a fool!" said Pat, hastily, and hiss- ing the words through his teeth. "You have spoiled the whole game to-night, and perhaps forever." The man who fired was a hasty-tempered fellow, who bore unmistakable hatred toward Fleming, for his con- duct to a poor family whom he knew. He thought he was in duty bound to not lose such an opportunity, al- though Pat's order had been disobeyed. Dolan, perceiv- ing the companions of Fleming beat a hasty retreat, or- dered a general discharge at their heels. A thousand echoes resounded through the silent wood. Fleming fell to the ground, in hopes that he might escape. He be- lieved that several hundreds of rebels were concealed somewhere near at hand. After a brief consultation with his men, Pat ordered three of them forward to secure Fleming, and take him some distance away, there to remain till the work was gone through, so that Fleming might not be able to learn anything of those engaged at it. Fleming's wound was a dangerous one. Hehad fainted from loss of blood. In his unconscious state he was re-   90   -TItEK- IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, moved to a neighboring house, where he was speedily at- tended to, but nothing could stay the inflammation that supervened. The wretched man was soon in the raging delirium of fever, and, for some days, his life was de- spaired of. The pike-handles were speedily cut down, and, as many hands made light work, the pikes were got ready with all due despatch, and carefully transmitted to their des- tined places. Dolan had word sent to Milliken concerning what had happened to Fleming, and was instructed to have him taken to a distant part of the country immediately. Pat performed the work himself; neither was he one hour too soon in accomplishing his task; for, Fleming being missed, every exertion was wMiade to find out his whereabouts. The patrols who were with him in the woods, gave out a report that he had wandered from their company, and that, after a diligent search, they had concluded among themselves that he must have gone homeward. They did this in order to screen their own cowardice. As the report spread, Dolan's men were not in the least dissatisfied that their midnight excursion had thus escaped public attention being directed to- wards it. Pat used every effort to make the rough journey as easy as possible to the invalid. During their progress, Fleming appeared to get much worse; the delirium in- creased, and Pat was not a little astonished to find his own name frequently mixed up with that of others, well known to him, and, which the unconsciousness of Flem- ing led him to divulge. Curses, threats, and blasphemy, were mixed up with a revelation of the intentions of Captain Mackenzie, whose brave fellows were determined to take revenge for the misfortunes of Cameron. "Let us move on quickly," said Fleming; "there-   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      91 stand back, I say, from that blaze. Where's the dog-the men-the men--ready, there?  Cormac, the hound, is absent; another brand-well done-ah! I like those screams; ha! ha!--good, good, boys, down-down--" and the raving of the man overpowered him. He would gather himself up, as if about to make a spring, and then fall back again into the bed of hay that Pat had pro- vided.  Pat's heart nearly stopped beating, as he listened to the wild and terrible words of Fleming. What could they mean? How he wished that his task were over; a fearful foreboding took possession of him. At times he felt inclined to pitch Fleminfg on to the roadside. What right had he to trouble himself with a fiend like him? Must he obey orders? That was the sore point with Pat, just then, and he felt it. His way lay up a steep hillside, and he thought that he would never accomplish his journey before nightfall. He was strangely uneasy, and every effort he made to calm his mind was useless. At length the end was reached. Fleming was carefully placed in a comfortable bed in a house kept by a man named Roddy Flynn. Roddy's wife was to take charge of him, and if he showed signs of speedy recovery, he was to be confined to the house until word was brought or sent to Dolan. The latter made all haste in returning. He barely took sufficient time to refresh himself, and give a feed of oats and water to the horse. Fairly started on the road-fully a distance of twenty-five miles from his own house-Pat felt lonely and dispirited, whether owing to the fatigue of work the night previous, and to the long drive which he had now to repeat, is not easily told. Perhaps he felt that his presence was required at home. What could Fleming mean by his allusion to Cormae   92    TU'H  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, and to another fire?"Surely to God!" he exclaimed, "the villains will not make another attempt on the widow's house!" The thought half maddened him, and he lashed the poor beast unmercifully, as if it should fly instead of trotting. The best part of the ground was gone over. The night was cold and chilly, and poor Pat was half-benumbed. Just as he was congratulating himself on the prospect of nearing home, one of the wheels broke down, and Pat was pitched out of the cart. He was stunned, but not much hurt. There was little time to deliberate on what he should do. The horse was unyoked, and, mak- ing a sort of straddle for its back, Pat soon mounted, having removed the injured cart into an adjoining field.   'THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     93 CHAPTER XTTT. BURNIN'G OE 'WIDOW nOGANS HOUSE--ARRIVAL OF PAT DOLAN AT THE SCENE-DEATH OF CAMERON-RESCUE OF  BRIGID O'ARA--DEATI OF CO0]MAC'S MOTHER- HORRIBLE ATROCITIES, "Sacred the cause that Clan Conaill's defending- The altars we kneel at the homes of our sires; Ruthless the ruin the foe is extending- Midnight is red with the plunderer's fires!" iSHOR'TLY after Pat Dolan had started in charge of leming, Phil and Ned were made aware of another attempt to burn the dwelling of Cormac's mother. The young men where so bewildered that they knew not what course to follow-Cormac and the two Mullans absent, their father absent, and additional yeomanry and soldiers in all parts of the country. That was not the time for inaction, however, and the two brave fellows started to work at once. Word was sent round the country by trusty messengers, and every %vailable man ordered to attend that nigh, at an early hour, in the smiddy. About nine o'clock, over thirty men were on the spot. Ned Dolan explained the cause of his father's absence, nentioned the report he had heard, and took upon him- elf the duty of calling the men together to see what ehould be done under the circumstances. Scarcely had ed finished speaking, when two men, who had been ummoned to attend, rushed in, exclaiming:   "   THE IRISH WDOW'S SON; OR, "My God, the widow's house is enveloped in flames!" Dolan's sons sprang to their feet, and grasping a pike each, shouted to the men to follow. Little encouragement was needed. The men rushed out, some armed, and some unarmed. They were joined by others on their way. The glare of the flames had lit up tlt sky, and, as the brave fellows approached, they found the house surrounded by yeo- manry. Hastily collecting their men, Phil and Ned Dolan passed the word, "Surround them." One half of the house was completely enveloped in flames. "Curse the contrary wind," said one of the yeos. Before the word had more than escaped from his lips, a portion of the building fell. A loud and piercing shriek issued from within the burning house. Ned Dolan sprang to the door at the risk of his life. "Good God!" he exclaimed," the door is barred, or nailed, and some one within." A shot was fired at him as he sprang through the win- dow in the gable of the house, Where the fire had but par- tially reached. The place was filled to suffocation with a thick smoke. He found Cormac's mother lying speechless on a bed. it was the Work of an instant to carry her to the win- dow. Three or four men sprang forward on the instant to receive her. "There 's somebody else within," gasped Ned, and the brave fellow re-entered. The yeomanry tossed the burning material with the points of their bayonets over that part of the house not, yet destroyed.   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      95 Four of them rushed forward to the window through which Ned had carried out the widow. The heat was intolerable, and they retreated. The moment he re-appeared, he had Bridgid O'Hara in his arms. Her dress was on fire 1 "Back!" cried a voice, presenting a gun at the noble fellow, who was thus sacrificing himself in rescuing the girl. That moment the speaker, Duncan Cameron, fell dead where he stood. Pat Dolan's hand had struck him lifeless to the earth. One bound, and Ned was free of the devouring ele- ment. "Close upon them, and bury them in the ruins!" shout- ed Pat Dolan, with a fierceness that sounded like a death- knell to many who heard it. The surrounding glare had partly concealed the force which arrived with Phil and Ned. The yeomanry thought that a much larger force had arrived with Pat, whereas not a soul accompanied him. He witnessed the rush of his men to the spot, and saw that his two brave sons had learned all about the dan- ger. The first words he heard uttered set his blood on fire. An indiscriminate fight took place, while every mo- ment was heard the fearful doom- "In with them; bury them in the burning pile!" and two of the leaders were driven into the flames at the point of the pike. The yells and imprecations were fearful. Widow Ro-  gan and Bridgid O'Hara were tenderly conveyed a short distance and laid down on some straw. ! The widow never spoke. The scream that-startled the men, and set their hearts on fire with vengeance, was the last utterance of the poor widow. Bridgid lay beside   96   -THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR} her in a swoon, and as pale as the corpse of her whose soul had ascended to the judgment seat of heaven. "The widow is dead!" shouted one of the men beside her. A rush was made to where she lay, to attest the truth. Several of the yeomen made good their escape. "Oh, heavens, the poor boy, Cormac!" exclaimed Do- lan. "Death to every man of them!" was shouted again and again. Those who fled were pursued; those who could not fly, engaged in battle for their lives. They were overpow- ered. In some instances, their bodies were transfixed with pikes, others were shot through the heart, and, as already related, two of the number were hurled into the fire created by themselves. Ned Dolan engaged two of those who sought their safety in flight. One he pierced through the body; from the other he received a wound in the head that stretched him on the ground where he stood. A dozen arms were raised in his defence, and his opponent lay a corpse be- side his companion. Death, desolation, and ruin, reigned around. No ef- fort was made, for none could have availed, to stay the ravages of the devouring element. The corpse of the widow was borne to Dolan's house. Brigid was carried to her father's. Several of the brave men who accompanied Phil and Ned Dolan were injured. Some were wounded, but none dangerously; six of the yeomanry, including the villain Cameron, were left lifeless on the ground; others were injured, some of them maimed for life. Of the latter, no correct account was ever learned. Ned Dolan, the most recklessly daring and gallant of   ate PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      97 all he led, sustained a severe scalp-wound, but it was not likely to prove very dangerous. *   .

A double incentive to Cameron was the fact which he had learned that day, of Brigid O'Hara being the com- panion of the widow during the absence of her son. As Ned Dolan said, the door of the dwelling was in- deed nailed, so were the wind ows; but Ne d's impetuous spring had carried all before him, and t he latter fact was unobserved.

These, and such like addi- tions, found ready listeners and believers; for it is well known, and attested by history, that crimes like these were but too common in many parts of Ireland, and were generally the concomitants of other outrages, perpetrated by a debased and cowardly soldiery. No, the body of Widow Rogan was not consumed to ashes. That holy tenement was preserved for Christian burial. In death, as in life, the impress of virtue was stamped on every feature. The rare goodness of her heart, -the purity of her soul, were traced by the divine hand in visible characters on that face of loveliness. Behold it now, with the winding-sheet beside it, soon to enwrap it from the gaze of those who fondly loved her in life, and now offer up their prayers for the repose of her soul. A solitary light burns on the altar of the little chapel. A coffin is laid on a plain deal table at the altar rails. Beside it kneels a girl, with face as pale as marble. The storm of sorrow has passed over her soul, and the calm- ness of grace supersedes the violence of her sorrow. That girl is Kate O'Neill,- who loved the widow as the child loves its mother. For hour after hour she has knelt there, almost afraid to move, lest her sorrows return. One by one the devout worshippers have left. A gentle hand touches the girl on the shoulder; she understands that touch; it is her uncle. The old man gently takes her by the hand, and kindly leads her into the house, There are kind friends there who sympathize with Kate by looks and deeds more than words. The blow is too great for words to express their feelings. Mrs. McQuil- lan and Mrs. McLeesh are there to attend on Kate. They anticipate her wishes, and lead the poor heart-broken girl to her little room; she kneels again; they join her, and silently they offer their prayers before that statue of   THE PIEMEN O     INETY-IGT.     99 Mary, which Sate had loved so much, and to which she became specially endeared f om the night when the chapel was almost miraculously preserved from the hands of the in cendiary. forse alothe scene, but to s withdraw the veil from be- fore anotoher.

For ages rapine ruled our plains, And slaughter raised his red right hand; And virgins shriek'd!--and roof-ttrees blaz'd- And desolation swept the land." THE report of the burning of Cormac Rogan's dwell- inL, the death of his mother, and the injuries sustained by Bridgid O'Hara, formed the sole topic of conversation among the peasantry of those places in which the deeds took plaee., The death of Cameron, the supposed murder of Flem- ing, were eagerly discussed by the Orangemen and the Government party, who, powerful in means and posi- tion, although vastly inferior in numbers, induced the military authorities at Belfast to send out two companies of soldiers extra, to be quartered on the inhabitants of Feenagh, Ballygrooly, Magheralane, and  Magheragh. Nothing could exceed the terror with which the inhabit ta'ts of these districts received the intelligence of this additional burden. Pat Dolan found it necessary to leave his home in care of his wife and daughter Peggy. He and his sons retired to a place called Tamlaghmore, where, by instructions from headquarters, he ontinued his work of pike-making ridgid 'ara  house was one of the fist selected in Bridged O'Hara's house was one of the first selected ins   102   THE  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, the country for soldiers to be quartered on. Her father, by the advice of ]Kate O'Weill, and with the consent of Father McAuley, had Bridgid remored to the care of Kate.. The poor girl was Still suffering from the effects of the shock she sustained at the death of jWidow Rogt, as well as from the inj uries she received during the noble and daring act of Ned Dolan at the time of her rescue from the flames. iany and anxious were the inquiries she made after Ned; and thought, as the father and sons had left their place, that something fatal had occurred to the brav fe- low Such was not the case. Ned continued to rally, day after day, and was soon afterwards in the enjoyment of his usual health and strength. Bridgid's father and family were easy-going people and neither felt nor took much interest in the affairs that were then distracting the country. After Bsidgid's removal, a party of soldiers were sent round the country in search of arms. Sometimes they went in pairs, and sometimes singly, to prosecute their Work. One of this party enteredthe house ofBridgid'sfather, and proceeded to make the usual search. Behind the door leading into the kitchen stood a step-ladder, by nmeans of which a "loft" was reached. This"loft was the usual receptacle for lumber and things of that nar ture not immediately required for use. Sometimes the "Ioft " was used as a sleeping-plave for farm servants; and, as the latter were wellknown to be activelyemploy- ed in the " united business those " lofts " received spe- cial attention at the hands of those employed to search for arms. A soldier entered O'Hara's house for this pur- pose, and immediately proceeded up the step-laddler, at the foot of which he left his gun and bayonet. The step-ladder was a narrow one, stood nearlyup- right in its dark corner, and consequently was difficult to ascend.   THE PIKEMEN    OF NINETY-EIGHT.   103 After being engaged at the work of exploring for arms, the soldier descended. In doing so his foot slipped, and he fell, transfixed with the bayonet of hiis gun. He died on the instant, and O'Hara was suspected of foul play. In consequence of this, he was taken to Antrim, and af- ter a preliminary examination, was thrown into prison. At the trial he was acquitted of the charge of murdering the soldier, and was accordingly released. His readiness in permitting two soldiers to be billeted on him, and the fact of his never being known to have joined with the United Irishmen, served his cause better than the at- tempt which he made to establish his innocence. Such was the easy-going character of this man O'Hara, who was neither liked nor disliked by his neighbors. His family would have passed by unnoticed had it not been for the warm-hearted virtues of Bridgid, who was respect- ed and loved for her generous disposition. One of the soldiers stationed at O'Hara's was an Eng- lishman, who took little pains to conceal his dislike for the unmannerly and rebellious Hirish. The other soldier was our friend Sandy, the Scotchman, who took such a sudden liking to the Rev. Mr. Porter's servant-maid. Although Sandy did not relish " the mad harum- scarums who were aye kiclkin' up sic infernal squabbles in the hale kintra," yet it must be confessed that he bore a very small amount of love for his companion-in-arms. Whatever authority existed in their case was vested in the Englishman, and this was another source of irri- tation to Sandy, who did not by any means relish the order to go out of nights, after suppertime, especially when the nights were cold and dark, and the comforts of a large kitchen, with its great blazing turf-fire, were so invitingly at hand. The Englishman knew Sandy's repugnance to night travel, and often imposed disagree- able duties on himself in order to annoy the Scotchman. Mike Glinty used to visit the O'Haras only occasionally.   104   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR.9 Since the advent of the red-coats, he seldom missed a day without paying one or more visits, and sometimes stopped over night. Both soldiers enjoyed Mike's company very much, as he afforded a good subject for their banter. Mike was not displeased in the least at this mark of their attention toward him. He rather enjoyed it; and, fool as he was, managed to learn some things which subsequently proved to be matters of no small importance to Pat Dolan, and others of Mike's friends. "Who killed Duncan Cameron, Mike?" said Sandy, one day, as he sat at the fireside enjoying his pipe after dinner. "Do-do-don't know who kic-kic-killed him, nin-nin-nor don1t care, sis-sso I don't.-" "The people a' say 't was you, Mike." "Pip-pip-people do-do-don't say anything of the kic- kic-kind," retorted Milke; "all th-th-they say is, th-th- that I wouldn't pray for hm." "There's no muckle use in prayin! for folk when they're dead," said Sandy. "Th-th-there will bib-bib-be little use in-n-n praying foryou, wh-wh-when you're dead, fif-fif-for the devil won't lil-lil-let you gi-gigigo, once he kic-kic-crtches you," re- plied Mike, laughing at the thought of Sanldy and the devil being engaged in a pugilistic encounter, in which, according to Mike's notions of such things, every red- coat was to come off second-best. Depend on't, Mike, auld Nick will thrapple you yet for your misdoin's, an' I ken he'll clap you in a hot neuck, once he lays hauns on you."

He and his brother had lived like members of the family, and had experienced all the care of a mother at the hands of the widow. Their sorrow was consequently very great, and they longed to see poor Cormac, and to try to comfort him in the sad hour of his affliction. Israel Milliken also lamented the misfortune that had overtaken his young friend. On all sides, Cormac met with unbounded sympathy, so warmly and so heartily tendered, that a few weeks after the sad occurrence of his mother's death saw him en- gaged devotedly in his work of organization. Many young men who had held aloof before, were now only too willing to enroll themselves under Cormac's leadership. His manly bearing under his sufferings, to- gether with the innate worth of his character, rendered him the beloved of all who knew him, and the heads of the movement in which he was engaged, found in him one worthy of their confidence in every respect. He soon found out the full value of Mike Glinty, who, since the death of Cameron had not so much to occupy his mind as before, and who believed that he owed a large debt of gratitude to Cormac and Pat Dolan; to Cormao for the loss he had sustained at the hands of Cameron and to Pat Dolan for ridding the earth of a villain who ruined the Dorrians. Mike was consequently employed by Cormac in visit- ing those houses like the O'Haras', where the soldiers were quartered, and reporting regularly everything he heard or saw.   106   THaE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, CHAPTER XV. EESTllVlM'S AT SHANEES  CASTLE -MTHTES INTFT TT- GENCE PU13THER- DISPLAYED-DANGER AT BA3SD- MRcANS ARTATC' TO ARREST IT. "When Saint Patrick our order created, - And called us the Monks of the Screw, Good rules lhe: revealed to our Abbot, To guide us in what we should do." IP what was true of the state of Ireland in 1735, when Swift described its sufferings to Pope, the evils of that, state became intensified in '97-98. "This kingdom," said Swift, ' is now absolutely starving, by the means of evelryoppressionthat can be inflicted on mankind. Shall I not visit for those things, saith the Lord. We are slaves, knaves, and fools,-and all, but bishops and people in employment, beggars. The people of Lapland, or the Hottentots, are not so miserable a people as we; for, oppression supported by power will infallibly in- troduce slavish principles." Thus said Swift, over sixty. years before the horrors of '98 had driven the people into premature rebellion. In Ireland as in France, a few years previous, those of the aristocracy who chose to remain in the country were solely engaged in the pursuit of pleasures, careless of the suffering condition of the people over -vhom they reigned, with all the power and oppression which the feudalism of bygone centuries enabled them to exercise.  Shane's Castle, . famous as the residence of the descendants of the -great chiefs of Ulster was, at the time   Aid) PIK-lSF? N OF NINETY-EIGHT.    107 of our story, occupied by John O'Neill, who was elevated to the peerage in 1793, in consequence of the part he took in offering the unrestricted regency to the Prince of Wales. This Baron O'Neill, in whose blood there was not the slightest- tincture of those whose name he in- herited, was a type of the ruling landlords at that pe- riod, so far as his castle presented scenes of luxury and revelry; but in other respects he was a moderately good landlord, and his tenants enjoyed many privileges which others of their class were not permitted to enjoy For a period of fifteen years, the festivities at Shane's Castle were known to be carried on without any regard to expense, and the people around Randalstown could not be blind to the fact, that the money which their toil and sweat had gathered friom the fruits of theearth was thus spent in, debauchery r Aod pleasure, and for the grat- ification of that English-Irish nobility who hated the people if they dared to lift their heads on their own lands. Some idea of these matters will be gathered from the rules which Lord M3ountjoy drew up for the regulation of festivities at Shane's Castle, and to promote regulari- ty at the meeting for the representation of Cymbeline in the  performance of which, the famous Mrs. Siddons took a part. The style is supposed to be after the ironi- cal manner of Dean Swift.  "I. That no noise be made during the forenoon, for fear of awaking the company. 2. That there shall be no breakfast made after four o'clock in the afternoon, \nor tea after one in the morn- ing. 3. To inform any stranger who may come in at breakfast, that we are not at dinner. 4. That no person be permitted to go out driving till the moon gets up, for R fear of being overturned in the dark. I. That the re- spective grooms may put up their horses after four hours' parading before the hall-door of the Castle.  6. That there shall be one complete hour between each   108   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON     OR, meal. 7. That all the company must assemble at dinner before the cloth is removed. 8. That supper may not be called for till five minutes after the last glass of claret. 9. That no gentleman be permitted to 'drink more than three bottles of hock at, or after, supper. 10. That all M. P.'s shall assemble on post-days, in the cof- feo-room at four o'clock, to frank letters.'-  Although evidently drawn up in a humorous vein, the above indicate but too clearly the manner of life in which the Irish landlords and their satellites enjoyed themselves at the expense of their rack-rented tenantry. It was during a carnival of dissipation that the splen- did structure, Shane's Castle, was burned almost to the ground. The ruins to this day attest the magnificence of the building. Among the many suites of rooms in the Castle was an apartment called the Banshee's room. This place con- tained a bed, and as regularly as these rooms were heated for the comfort of visitors, the Banshee's apartment re- ceived like attention. It was during such preparations that the Castle was destroyed. Around the Castle are many subterranean passages, believed to have been wine-vaults at one time; but the probability is, they were used as a refuge for the O'Neills' retainers in times of war. In one of these passages, in which there were several ways of exit and entry, Cormac had given instructions to have consigned about eighteen hundred pikes, the majority of which had been carefully brought from Newry. Owing to the vigilance of the soldiers and yeomanry, it became a matter of difficulty to find a secure place for the storage of arms and ammunition. The latter being * Correspondence of the Marquis Cornwallis,   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGY1T.       109 much less in quantity was easier managed than the for- mer, and did not require so much expertness to secrete them. At nightly drills, those who were to use the pike were put through their exercise as readily without that weap- onl, as wilth it; so that a place of safety for those articles was looked upon by Cormac and his companions as high- ly essential for the forthcoming day of their special use. Pat Dolan had ftie charge of six forges, in different parts of the country, from  which about one hundred and fifty pike-heads were turned out daily. - Parties were regularly counted off twice a week to pro- cure the handles and necessary fittings; and at a meet- ing of Provincial delegates, held at Belfast, on St. Pat- rick's Eve, the highest praise was awarded to Cormao HEogan for the well-drilled and efficiently-armed condition of his men. Reports of the most encouraging character were com- ing in daily from all quarters. Nothing could daunt the spirit thathaad been aroused.  The treacheries of Newell, of Hughes, and Magin, in the North, of Major Sirr, Rey- nolds, and O'Brien, in Leinster, all failed to quench the fire of enthusiasm.  But it soon became evident, from the action of the authorities, that the death of Cameron, and others of Mackenzie's- yeomanry, would, if possible, be avenged. Many difficulties existed in carrying out thezintentions of the Government. Those who were guiltyvf setting the widow's house on fire were afraid to acknowledge - their complicity, and thereby prove their presence at the place. If they had known   better, they would have been only too glad to have given all the evidence required. Others of them got afraid of being visited by the ven- geane of the people, and so for these reasons the au- thoritieS were compelled to forego their intended prose- cutions. Cameron's death, therefore, was simply a  nine   "O  'T'Hi IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OE, days' wonder, after which he was regretted by none, not even those who were his chief companions. Brigid O'Hara, for one, did not shed many tears at his end, nei- ther did KIate O'Neill. Pat Dolan was busily engaged at work, when Mike came to him with some news. "Scotchman aa-and Englisman bib-bib-oth ig-ig- go-going out-t-t-t-nin-nin-nin-night to trap Mim-Mimn-Mr. Yllliken, an-an-and Mike thinks he-he-he will gig-gig-go outs too, along with them."

Jast then, Cormac Rogan entered, and Pat detailed what he had learned from Mike. ' There must be some truth in it" said Cormac. "Mr. Milliken and McCracken are to hold a private meeting, either to-night or to-morrow, in Bev Mr. Porter', and that fellow Sandy, the Scotchman, knows Milliken. There must be word conveyed to him at once."  Mike wasinstructed to go back and stay about O'Haras house, and watch and listen to everything that passed between the two soldiers. Should he learn anything, he was to make baste over to Pat's with the news. "An-an-and won't I gig-gig-go with them, and th-th- throw them off the scent?"   T7HE  PTKEMEN .OF NINETY-EIGHT.   ill No, not now, Mike. Do as I tell you, like a good fel- low," said Cormac, clapping him on the shoulder. "e-ye-yes, Cormac, Mim-Mim-Mike is a good-d-d fel- low," and away he ran as fast as- he could to execute his orders, "He's a lucky creature, that same Mike," said Pat. Cormac stood buried in thought for awhile, and paid no attention to Pat's remark. "See, Pat!'" he said hurriedly. "Out with the horse. Give it a feed as quickly as possible. I'll be off for John Mullan at once. He must go to Belfast, and intercept llliiken and McCracken.- I believe their business is the distribution of those pikes to the Templepatrick and Saintfield men. John Mullan was speedily on the road, and Mike had returned meantime with the news that there were six soldiers in a1ll going off, and that they were all ready to start. They were to drive on a car. This was dangerous looking, and Cormac felt that there must be some means whereby the government were put in possession of Milliken's movements. After a brief consultation with Pat, Cormac decided on following John Mullan, accompanied with Pat's sons and Johns brother. He would take the old road, and make all speed. Pat would have gone also, but there was a drill meeting that night in McCallum's grange, and Pat would be required to fill the place of Cormac in the latter's absence.   "2  'Tui IRISE WIDOW'S SON   OR7 CHAPTER XYI. JOHN MrT TANS M[ISSIO-A DTTIMUMMA-MT T^. AN M'CBACKEN RESCUED FBOdM THE SOLDIEBS-A PlO- CTAMATION. "Our heads so stout have got us fame, For soon 'tis known from whence we came e; WhLere'er we go they dreadthe name of Gayowen in glory.' THE same pass-words which had been adopted only a few weeks previously by the Dublii Directory, were in use in the North, and, in consequence of intelligence lately received from headquarters, Milliken, Porter and MdcCracken, were n 'king arrangements for a speedy ch an ge.--- The government received information of those words from the infamous Reynolds, and the consequences were sure to prove serious, unless a change were effected im- mediately. "Wheres McCann? Is Ivers from Carlow come?" were the pass-words. By the use of these, the meeting at Oliver Bond's house, in Dublin, was surprised, and fifteen leaders of the organization sent toprison to await their doom. Fourteen .armed soldiers entered Bond's house, and were within the merest chance of arresting Lord Ed- ward Fitzgerald. Dr. XacNevin, Thomas Addis Emmet Salmpson, and others, were all arrested. Lord Ed-ward, on turniulg a corner of Bridgestreet) on his wzay. jo the meeting, perceived the English mercenaries prowling   THlEs PT TTME W OF NINETY-EIGHT.   113 about, and, with the aid of his faithful body-guard, effect- ed his escape! This was the first great blow the organization re- ceived. It is sad, but true; traitors are always found, for the sake of gold, to betray the dearest interest of a nation. Our indignation is divided between the traitor and the government who employs him. It is indeed no small difficulty to say which is worse. The intense selfishness 4 of the informer merely proves the weakness of poor hu- manity; the despicable act of the government proves two things: the knowledge that oppression has created the necessity of seeking for the informer, and the desire to rule a country in opposition to the wishes of its people. John Jullan dashed along at a good rate. Darkness, however, was overtaking him, and consequently he -had to slow his pace, lest he should miss the object of his mission. Arriving at a place called the White-well-brae-a lone- ly spot, in the vicinity of the Cave-Hill mountain-he hastily pulled up. Two men approached. A jaunting- car was -in advance, which made it evident that its oc- cupants were those who were " walking the hill." Suddenly John dismounted, and approached the men. They instantly went aside- to allow the stranger to pass. Mullan was uncertain whether to approach them or not. The light was not sufficient to enable him to recognize the features of the party. The others were apparently not over-willing to permit themselves to be too closely scrutinized by the stranger who had dismounted. Hav- ing passed each other, Mullan remained stationary for a few minutes, thinking what was best to be done under the circumstances. He at once decided to speak to the gentlemen, but meantime they had taken their seats on 8   "4   '1tHE IRISH WIDOWS$ SON; OR, the car, and were driving forward. Mullan followed them, and, in order to overtake them, had to put his ,  horse to a smart gallop. In less than five minutes he overtook them, and, just as he did so, the soldiers who had started to intercept Milliken, appeared on the road. "Pull up," shouted John, in an excited tone of voice. A crack of the whip by the driver of the car was the only reply. The red coats of the, soldiers were quite visible; and their appearance seemed to make the gentlemen in the car undecided whether to proceed or turn the horse's head in the opposite direction. The latter plan was quickly adopted, thus enabling Mullan to again approach the gentlemen. He did so quite closely, and again begged of them to stop. A pistol was snapped at him, which made the horse he rode suddenly rear itself on its hind legs, and nearly threw the rider to the ground. The flash from the pistol made, the soldiers quicken their pace. In a few minutes they had surrounded the car; and the Scotchman approaching closer, at once identified Mr. Milliken. Orders were given to have both gentlemen-the other was Henry Joy McCracken-handcuffed, and driven toward Belfast.  John Mullan was now considerably in advance, -and kept so for a while. He at once saw the error that had been committed. He had no doubt now that the very party whom he had hurried forward to intercept upon their journey, were then in the hands of the soldiers. What was he to do under such circumstances? His-reflections were most painful. Although he had acted strictly in accordance with the instructions he re- ceived, yet, there was the painful result. .  .   j   HTE PTKtElEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.    115 Wllat would Cormac say? What would Pat I)olan think? Surelyhe must have been to blame in some way? pSuch were the unpleasant reflections that speedily passed through the brave fellow's mind, as he kept well ahead of the escort. The soldiers had lost sight of Mullan, and were proceeding with their prisoners at a moderate rate along the road. Shortly after, the moon rose call and clear, and John "Mullan kept debating within himself whether to go forward or return. But then, how could he be the bearer of the bad news R? e who was sent specially to prevent what had occurred. C  e was well armed, so likely were qnilliken and Mc- What if he would attempt a rescue? They were only three to six; but John felt, just then, that he alone could match any two of them, probably three. But the prison- ers, no doubt, were handcuffed, and John did feel mis- erable indeed,             d feel mis. At a point where the old and new roads verged into one, John pulled up for a moment. Hlis quick ear caught the sound of horses' feet. Presently a c ar peared, on which were seated four men     ap- One moment more, and off sprang Cormac Rogan. "Any word ?" inquired Cormac, hastily. John Mullan's heart bounded with delight. "No time for explanation," replied John, flinging him- self othe horse;" they are both prisoners-, "Both of whom  ?" asked C ormac, quite excitedly. "Miliken and McCracken. They are coming this way." In a few seconds, Cormac had his men close beside the hedge. The horse and car; and the horse used by John, were brought alongside into the shadow of the trees, and placed in charge of Peter Mullan. The soldiers were quickly approaching.   "6  rTEE 1 IRI  WIDOW'S SON; OR, "Nail the horses first," said Cormac; " then fling our- selves with a simultaneous bound upon-thie soldiers. The others will quickly comProhend the whole ting."p The words had scarcely escaped from Cormac'slips when the cars approached. As no person could be seen, the soldiers were taken completely by surprise The reports of two or three pistols had scarcely ceased to be heard on the- night air, when Cornac and his com- pasions made a spring upon- the soldiers, and disarmed them. Not a moment was lost on the part of Millilrell and DMcCracken, both of whom started off as fast as their feet could carry threrm It was with some difficulty that Peter Mnllan overtook them, and, to their joy, they learned that a means of conveyance was at hand. The soldiers, it can be easily imagined, were thrown into a panic. , The attack was so unexpected; the-quick demand, or, rather, the taking of their arms, was the work of a moment, the soldiers believing that a larger felce of men were present than what, really were; allthis,too, with the uncertain light, rendered them unconscious of how to act. The great joke, as it afterwards turned out, was, that they believed the attack to have been made solely for the firearms, and not with any intention of releasing their prisoners, who they believedmanaged their escape during the momentary disorder. The horses at- tached to the two cars were not even killed. In a few minutes, Cormac and his party were on their way, arranging for their work that nightwhichhad been so unexpectedly interfered with, and so suddenly put to rights again. The explanation of Milliken, to the effect that he had taken Iqullan for a spy, and who was borne out in his suspicion by McCracken, caused a good hearty laugh to all concerned. They had certainly as good reason to ia- dulge in their merriment, as the soldiers had to lament the misfortune that deprived them of their fielocks, and   THE PIKEMEN    OF NINETY-EIGSHT.   11 7 forced them to return unarmed and without their pris- oners. "The de'il tak' those murderin' crooked caries, wha made sic a raid on his Majesty's forces," said Sandy to his companion; "but I suppose," continued the canny Scot, "we maun be thankful to the rebel rascals that they did na tak' oor lives as weel." "There ain't much use hollerin' till we're out of the wood," replied his English companion-in-arms; said arms being just then despoiled of what Corm:ac called "loyal marks and tokens." "You dinna .think the rebels will return and shoot is-?" indignantly demanded Sandy. "It is hard to say what the demned fellas may do, or may not do," said the Englishman in reply; " they had scarcely demanded the arms when you held out your gun to them." "That's ae strapping lee," retorted Sandy, with consid- erable vehemence, at this imputation on his bravery. "But gin I cat to min', you sprang owre the machine (car), and left your gun ahint you." This was a pure fabrication on the part of Sandy, who felt there was some truth in the imputation of his com- panion, and wished to fasten some guilt on him. The Englishman appealed to the others to bear wit- ness in his behalf, that, when his gun was grasped by the tall fellow of the party, he held on by it till he missed his hold, and was dragged from the car. Sandy kept repeating his offensive language, calling the Englishman a liar, till the latter, feeling himself out- raged by the voluble charges of Sandy, raised his clenched fist, and sent the Scotchman floundering in the mud. Sandy was speedily assisted from his undignified posi- tion, and dared his antagonist to repeat his offence. The appeal was answered by another blow, which, not being relished by the recipient, an interchange of pugilistic,   "8   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, compliments took place,leaving visible marks of the striking affection -which those representatives of differ- ent nationalities bore to each other. The ill-feeling thus engendered did not tend to the promotion of harmony among this particular portion of the British forces. Others of the men took different sides, according to their likes and dislikes, and, before they arrived at their quarters, they presented the appear- ance of men who were brave enough to fall out and fight among themselves, if not quite able to prevent themselves from being disarmed. Next morning, when giving an account of the whole transaction to the officers in commiand at Antrim, Sandy, who had asked and obtained leave from the others, acted as spokesman, and did his work well, even to the satis- faction-of the Englishman. "By the sheerest accident we got hold o' the culprit Milliken, and anither, nae doot a rebel companion, lwha looked as if aboon the chiel WFiliken, an7 in a jiffey we had baith o' them tightly handcuffed, and proceeded on oor way. It was gettin' michty dark at the time, for the moon hadna risen. A' of a sudden, and afore ane 6' us could say ' chappin9 aboot a hundred men sprang owre a hedge, fired ,bang at the horses' heads, an' afore we could catch a gun-stock in our hands, wrenched the firearms frae us.

The canny Scot succeeded even beyond his expectar tions. Every man of the lot were praised for their dar- ing heroism, their conduct would be reported to the proper quarter, and, there could be no doubt of it, pro- motion would be sure to follow. A few days afterward, Cormac and his friends enjoyed a good laugh-at-the fol-   THE PIRRTAMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      119 lowing paragraph which appeared in the newspapers - C VHESEAS: --On the night of the 6th inst. a body of armed rebels, about one hundred in number did, at a place on the Antd road, known by the name of the White-well-Brae, at tack a small military guard in charge of two prisoners, and af- ter maltreating them in the most cowardly and ruffianly man- ner, took, or robbed them of their faear]Rs.

DOTINGS the night both Milliken and McCracken were secretly conveyed by Cormac and Pat to the subterra nean passage or vault beneath Shane's Castle, where the pikes were safely stowed away. ' What a splendid place of retreat," said McCracken, viewing the place. There are several of the same kind hereabouts," said Cormac;u and now that Fleming is removed, we are al- most safe in anything we choose to undertake hereabouts. A couple of boats on the Lough, one or two scouts at different points, and the exercise of a little caution on the part of those engaged at work, make us all right.7 "1What of Fleming?' inquired Milliken. - "Is he still improvinga 2- C Improvingevery day," replied Pat Dolan, who had joined the party. ^ He has not the slightest idea where he is, and Roddy FPlynn tells him some'strange stories,- how he happened to be conting home at night and found him lying in a ditch, bruised and bleeding. Flem-    ing is grateful to Roddy, and asks him quite a num- ber of questions, which Roddy declines to answer, on the ground that he is a poor ignorant man, and knows nothing about controversy." bU Never mind Roddy," said Cormac,"he's up to his business." "Hie will be very kind to Fleming as long as the latter is confined to his bed, and gives no trouble in looking over the country to find out where he is,' suggested Pat.                 .     ' "Roddy's wife," said John Mullan, "has no particular .

It was now far advanced in the night, and McCracken -".  asked his companions' advice as to whether they should - return to Templepatrick, or send a messenger for Mr.  Porter to meet them there.               v^ "Porter should see this retreat, and the interview can * " " best take place here," said Milliken.  PormaT and the others were of the same mind, and  Phil and Ned Dolan volunteered to start on the road. , Milliken took out his pockethook, and, writing a small U note, handed it to the brothers, who went on their mes-  X sage. By Cormac's orders, Peter Mullan was despatched for more oil for the lamps, some fire-wood, and if Mrs. Mc- Quillan had anything " special" to send, she was to make haste and send it. In the course of a short time, Peter returned with all the requisites for making the select partyas comfortable as could be under the circumstances. Seated around the fire, whose cheerful glow imparted   122   T1hE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, additional animation, the members of this revolutiona- ry party enjoyed each other's conversation with special relish. Cormac was aware that Milliken had had many hair- breadth escapes, and requested him to favor them with the recital of some of the incidents. "You remember," said Cormac, "you were about rehearsing something of that sort when we thought it prudent to dismount from the stage-coach before arriving at Newry." "I do, and it was concerning the place we had just then passed," replied Milliken. You remember the night after the appointment of Russell to the chief com- mand?" said the speaker, addressing McCracken. "I do, well," rejoined McCracken; "you had two or three commissions to execute in that time.' "No less than five of them between Belfast- and 2Newry,"' said Milliken; "and I was scarcely two miles beyond Lisburn when I got a reminder to be sharper on the lookout in future. I had been two nights without sleep; and, although the night was cold and frosty, the exercise of walking kept me comfortably warm. The warmth would force on drowsiness; and, in order to avoid the sensation which was creeping over me, I opened my overcoat and unbuttoned my vest. It was no use. Sleep would overcome me; and several times I found myself sleeping and walking at the same time. I would give a start suddenly, and feel refreshed on  awaking. However, I happened to stand for a few minutes at the post of a gateway leading into a field from the roadside, having heard the sound of approach- ing footsteps. I leaned against the post and fell fast asleep. How long I remained so, I could not then tell. I was just feeling sensibly refreshed with my nap, when a violent shaking- of my arm awoke me. There stood two men, wrapped up in heavy coats, before me. ' Who are you, and what the deuse are you doing here at this   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      12 ,'  time of night?' they inquired, in a tone of voice not altogether calculated to strengthen my nervous system. I at once comprehended that they were yeomanry pa- trols, and determined to set them at defiance as boldly as possible. ' See here, now,' H said, ' who are you, and what the deuse are you doing here at this time of night? "'Come on,' said one of the fellows to the other. 'Don't you see he is some drunken old tinker? said the speaker, lifting his foot and kicking an old flat box that had been lying within about a yard of where I stood, and which gave forth a most discordant rattle. To my utter surprise, they both departed, believing, no doubt that I was what they said. As soon as they were gone .  Istooped to examine the 'old tinker's box, and only - - judge my surprise when I found it to be"- -     7i' "A box of pike-heads," said Pat Dolan, laughing. "Precisely so," replied Milliken, not a little astonished at Pat's remark. "Flung down there that same night by Sweeney and his cousin," repeated Pat, "after being chased for two good Irish miles by a lot of Orangemen coming home from a lodge meeting at Broomhedge. I remember it well. They told me all about it on the following day, when they came   home, after searching for their lost treasure." "I found out afterwards," continued Milliken, "that I had not been over ten minutes dozing when I was so opportunely shaken up by my passing friends. A meet- ing was to be held that night about two miles further on, in a barn belonging to one Murphy. The girls were to turn out as well as the boys. I was soon at the place, and, passing through Murphy's house, speedily put on my Quaker garb; then, entering the barn, proceeded to work with the Bible spread open before me. 6' The place was but dimly lighted, and the young men   124   THE IRISH WIDOWS SON; OR, were coming forward to be enrolled as fast as I could en- ter their names, when Murphy, who was stationed out- side along with some others, entered, and gave the word that a party of soldiers were coning in that direction. - "About one-half the young men quietly slipped out,  the older ones and all the females remaining. -'4iuWt As I 'had arisen to my feet, with book in hand, ini adlash  a sergeant and about a dozen of soldiers. Without pretending to even as much as notice them, I proceeded with my Scriptural reading slowly and quite solemn-like. - The soldiers stood stillfor afew minutes; then, looking over my spectacles, I addressed them with the following words:-'Friends- what -cometh - thou -to -seek? We-are-people-of--peace-and-like-not-the-war paint-on-your-coats.' "' We know ourselves what we come to seeks replied the sergeant, in a voice which at once satisfied me that he did not intend mischief.  -  "If-thou-and-thy-friends-wish-to-join-with- us-we-shall-thank-the-Lord- for - the - happy- change.9 "' We have something else to do just now. Go on, old man, we won't disturb you,' said the sergeant, as he and his party took their leave.' "The faintest murmur of a distant laugh sounded on my ears, as the soldiers withdrew. Some of the boys who had gone out, remained eavesdropping, lest the sanctity of our proceedings should be profaned, and I believe they heard all that passed. "Business over, a fiddler was speedily procured, and the night's proceedings wound up with a good country dance." ';In that case, you changed your religion, Mr. Mli- ken," said M'Cracken. "H-ow?"i saidMliken.   lilt PIKEMEN OP NINETY-EIGHT.       125 Oh, merely by changing from Quakerism to Shaker- ism!   C "But I didn't dance," insisted Miltiken. aHere are our friends," said Cormac, as the sound of advancing feet was heard. The Rev. Mr. Porter, with Phil and Ned, were speedily in the presence of the others. A warm shaking of hands took place, and Mr. Porter could not help remarking on the strangeness of the place they had met in. "I had not the pleasure of knowing my two young friends," he said "but the notefrom Josiah Wilson, aias Israel Milliken,-at once decided for me thatthey were al right. Aswedrove along, howeverI felt somehow dis- satisfied, and once or twice felt inclined to return." I observed that, sir," said Phil, "and was just think- ing to myself that you didn't believe us, when we said these gentlemen were in a place like this." "Well, to speak candidly," replied the rev. gentleman, I had a few doubts, and, entering here, I felt convinced that somehow   I was being led into a trap, although I could not, explain it as ifght, see how to be mistaken in either one or other, or both of my guides." McCracken, and, in fact, the whole of the party, hearti- ly enjoyed the difficulties of the rev. gentleman. It never even once occurred to them that he would have any scruple in proceeding at once with his guides. "Now, when I look better into the whole affair," said Milliken, "you had some reason for what you say. How- ever, let that pass; you probably heard that McCracken and myself were made prisoners?" "Not till I was well on my way here," replied Mr. Por- ter.               , The matter of the arrest and rescue was fully explain- ed, and caused not a  little astonishment during its re- cital. The question of the intended rising was discussed in   !:.  126    HiE  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; eOR allits bearings. Government were- driving all things be- fore them; and what with the free quarters of soldiers, and the conduct of the yeomanry, the people would shortly be compelled in defence of whatever liberty was left them, to take the field, and resist by force the tyranny and oppression then grinding them down so fearfully. "I see no other course open for us," said Cormac," but one of open resistance. There is nothing left us what- ever, that we may call our own. Whatever is ours to-day, may not be ours to-morrow. Neither altars nor hearths are free to us. I differ from some of you, gentlemen, in principles of religion." "Pass all that by," said the Rev. Mr. Porter. "But," continued Cormac, emphatically, "the altar I knelt at, the hearth at which I was reared, have been set in flames; the one saved as by a miracle, the other burn- ed by fiends, and my poor mother ruthlessly sacrificed at the moment of our home's destruction." And the tears trickled from the eyes of the speaker, as he thus gave vent to the thoughts that were burning within him. "And what was his home was ours also," repeated John Mullan. "tHis mother was a mother to us, and to- night my brother and myself are orphans in a double sense, since that fatal day." '"For my part, and that of my poor family," said Pat Dolan, " we must either quit the country, or fight for leave to stay in it. My own life, and the lives of these poor fellows," he said, pointing to his two brave sons beside him, " are not worth that,'"-and he gave a filip with his thumb and finger-" since the day we fought to save ourselves from being murdered at the fair of An- trim." ( None of us," said, McCracken, "'are safe, either from persecution, or prosecution-" "Or worsen" said Milliken.   T7HE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       127 "Quite so, or worse," repeated McCracken; "and, so far as I am enabled to see, things are not improving." "My own personal experience, and the information I have derived from authentic and reliable sources," said the Rev. Mr. Porter, "enable me to come to this conclu- sion: Better, a thousand times over, to shake off the in- cubus of slavery that is dragging us all downward, and die in the attempt, supposing us to be unsuccessful, than lead the lives of suffering we are compelled to endure." Arrangements were then made to distribute all arms at once, to those not already supplied; to attend strict- ly to nightly drills, and, wherever feasible and safe, to have midday drills in barns and fields. If surprised by soldiers, or yeomen to fight to the death, rather than to allow one man to be made a prisoner. To avoid as far as possible all conflict with the' enemy; but, if attacked, to act resolutely, and give no. quarter. After discussing other matters, and exchanging items of news, the party quietly separated, each pledged to the other to redouble their exertions in the work in which they were engaged.   128   '1't1  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, CTFAPTER XVII. BRIGID AND AATEC, OR, APRIL FOOL--ATE AND BRIGID, A JOKE REPEATED--A CON4 vYSBSATION ON COMMON SENSE.           - "The cause is good, and the men they are true, And the Green shall outlive both the Orange and Blue! And the triumphs of Erin her daughtersi shall share, With the full swelling chest, and the fair' flowinghair." BRIGtHTLY rose the sun in new-made robes of splen- dor. His refreshing beams were calling forth the im- prisoned odors of earth and tree. Buds were thickening on the slender branches, ready to unfold themselves in all the loveliness of their emerald dress. Birds were trying their earliest notes, half frightened lest the cold of winter had not yet departed. They hop- ped from branch to branch and chirped, then flew a short distance, and gave forth a dozen notes of melody; still timid on wing, and uncertain in song. 'T was a beautiful spring morning, and Brigid O'Hara and Kate O'Neill were admiring from a room window the early blushes of the season. "As I live, there comes Cormac Rogan," said Brigid, with a smile. "Where?" asked Kate, with the least shade of tremu- lou-sness in her voice. a Oh, April Fool!" cried Brigid; and Kate blushed at the anxiety with which she had asked, "Where." "What a lovely rogue you are, Kate," insisted Brigid,   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       129 "to try to look dissatisfied with yourself for noticing my trick on your temper." Kate could not help laughing at the rosy smile that played around Brigid's mouth just then. "I forgot it was April Day," she said, " and it is indeed a delightful morning." "O, very delightful; and a delightful little attempt, too, to change our conversation," said Brigid. "Do you know," she continued, " the thought of mak- ing a fool of you came into my naughty mind just as I had finished my prayers?" "Then make an act of contrition for your naughti- ness," cried Kate, "and I'll forgive you." "Not till you repeat a beautiful act of Hope for poor old Ireland," replied Brigid, catching Kate by the arm. "That the spring-day of Freedom may one day dawn on this blessed Isle as calmly beautiful as dawned the golden splendors of this delightful morn, is the prayer and hope of my heart," said Kate, with animation. "And from my heart, I say, Amen," replied Brigid. "But there will, I fear, be a long night of sorrow and trouble ere that hope be realized, Brigid." "It is hard to say," answered the girl. "Troubles, no doubt, are in store for the poor country. She has borne much, and may yet have to bear and suffer a great deal more." "Too true, too true! dear girl." "I often wonder, Kate," continued Brigid, "why there is such disparity of mind among those who try how best to serve their country in the hour of their country's need. Look, for instance, at- the enthusiasm of Cormac Rogan " "And of John Mullan," said Kate. "Yes; of the whole of those whom we know. And then look at my own father." O   130   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "Men will often differ in these as in other thinigs,' said Kate. "I can understand their differing in the usual business of life; but when their country is in question-and that involves their -highest interests on earth-it does seem strange to me." "And to me also," replied Kate; " but men differ about the truth that leads to heaven." "a h, yes," sighed Brigid, "'I see it now, when they differ on that point we may well expect them to differ on anything." "After all, I don't think there is so much difference among our countrymen, as we are led to believe. We all know," maintained Kate, "that those'who are called, Irishmen, merely from the accident of their birth, are not of our people; their interests, their practices, their sympathies, their intentions and their hopes, are all different from ours. They know that everything they possess depends in a great measure on the success 'of English rule in Ireland, and naturally enough they de-, fend their position. The real Irish, however, are pretty o unanimous in their wish that the United Irishmen may ' succeed."  "That's the very thing; that's what I blame them for," said Brigid. "When people wait to see a grand success, who thanks them for joining in the hour of triumph? Not me, I'm sure." "My dear Brigid, you have spoken my mind as accu- rately as if you had guessed the very thoughts passing tlhrough it before you spoke. Men condemn enterprises, national ones especially, when success does not crown them; whereas, their own cold and indifferent conduct was the greatest barrier to that same success which would otherwise have been sure, but for their indiffer- ence. Men of that stamp are, perhaps unknown to them- selves, the greatest enemies our brave fellows have to contend against."   THEl PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     131 '"I have no patience with them?" said Brigid, with somethirng like a disdainful jerk of her head, and an un- Pleasant pout upon her rosy lips. "Just see them and hear tfhem preach their nos'trums. Itell yo, Kate, what I believe of them: they are cowards, rank and unmiti- gated cowards, who prefer to live from hand to mouth rather than hold up their heads," and the speaker began to strut across the room. "W;hisht! whisht!'" said Kate, almost in a whisper; "here is John Mullan just coming in at the door.' R un you out to meet him, Kate, and I'll hide behind the door," said Brigid, pushing Kate forward. Kate nearly fell with lauging. As she tried again and again to utter the'words, "April Fool," they always stuck in her throat; but Brigid comprehended what the other rmeant to sayand could not resist laughing, also, at the ability with which she was caught in the playfultrap of her own making. "We are both guilty now," said Brigid;"but I must say, you betrayed far greater anxiety, Kate, when I men- tioned C^ormae s name, than I did when you mentioned Oh, who ever heard the like?" cried KIate. "Betray anxiety!   Now, what do you mean?" t Simply this," nodded Brigid, "that you would pre- fer every day in the year to be Apil the First. just to ex- perience the little fright you got when you fairly thought that Cormac was coming."  qitell, note, really, Brigid, this is too bad, my dear girl, quite too bad." "I know all that; but you know I told you when I was recovering from illness that I would plague the life out of you; now surely you wouldn't have me to tell you a lie?" "'Both girls up this morning and enjoying the early smiles of Spring I exclaimed Father John, entering the room.   132   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; O, i "And enjoying one another's smiles just as well, dear Father John," said Brigid O'Hara, who had for some time past divided the attentions heretofore paid only to Kate. The good old man was never better pleased than when these girls were in company with each other. Brigid had, in the liveliness of her own nature, restored a great deal of the former animation that belonged to Kate. With all her sprightliness of character, Brigid had a thoughtful mind; but to the ordinary observer this was not so. There were .two persons who knew this well; these were Kate and her uncle. Perhaps there was an- other; but Brigid could not believe that he knew any- thing concerning her nature. "Dear Uncle, do you really believe that Brigid O'Hara will hereafter become a thoughtful and common sense woman?" "Certainly not," said Brigid, answering for herself. "Well, Kate, I really hope so. Let us always hope," said the old man, laughing, and entering into the spirit of the good nature that exhibited itself in Brigid and his niece. "Now see, Father John," said Brigid, crossing the forefinger of each hand, in a manner to claim attention to what she was about to -say; 6"1there is far too much of that thing in the world known by the name of com- mon sense. I don't like that which is so very common, after all. If you were common, if Kate O'Neill were common, I wouldn't like either of you." "You wouldn't like either of us!" said Kate, with feigned astonishment. "Not half so well," continued Brigid, quite seriously, "as I do now, because both of you possess more than common sense." "Upon my word, Kate," said Father John, "I think you had some reason to make such an inquiry, after all.   TIE PIKEMiIEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     133 [I am just debating in my own mind this moment whether Brigid ever will make a common sense woman." "Your old trick, Father John," replied the girl, lean- ing with clasped hands on Kate's shoulder. "You are just trying to keep back all the good things you think of poor Brigid. I got your blessing last evening," she continued, " and I know its good influence will remain with me forever." "Well, well, I must away;" said Father John, prepar- ing to leave. "No, you won't," said Brigid, "till I show you some- thing that kept your dear Kate for nearly an hour in her room last night, when poor uncommon sense Brigid thought the dear girl was at her prayers." Brigid put her hand into her pocket and drew forth a sheet of crumpled note-paper. Kate made to grasp it; but Brigid sprang backward, and putting herself into a mock dramatic attitude, said:- "Here's a production for a young lady, to be dropped carelessly where Cormac Rogan will be sure to find it." "A letter, oh; I won't stop to hear such things," said Father John. "No, no," said Brigid, "no letter; only listen. 'IS THE OLD LAND WORTH IT ALL? 'Is the land that gave us birth, boys, Worth fighting for or no? Is Erin, Holy Erin, but a prize for every foe? Shall we dare to claim the Island As our heritage once more?

Kate, you spend your time -" "Never mind, dear uncle," said Kate, " only a fly-sheet I was scribbling over, when thief Brigid snatched it up, and ran off with it," 'C Yes, I did," said Brigid, approaching Kate, and -taking her by the arm. "But, come, we shall have a stroll, and see if there are any primroses wanting to be plucked." "That's right, girls.

"He said that he was not our brother- The mongrel! he said what we knew; No, Eirre! our dear Island-IMother, He ne'er had his black blood from yOU." THE hard trial of adverse circumstances had wedded together two of as loving and pure young Irish hearts as could be found in an entire province. Kate O'Neill was made to be loved by all who knew her sweetness and goodness of heart. Her isolation heretofore had, to some extent, given a serious aspect and grave coloring to her character; but since the arrival of the light-hearted Brigid O'Hara, at her uncle's, Kate became much more of the girl, and less of the woman. Her uncle was rejoiced to observe this change, for there were moments when the pious old man believed that all -that was left to him on this earth would be likely also to take its departure, and make him lonely indeed. Brigid, on more than one occasion, desired to return home; but the entreaties of Kate, backed up by Father John, were sufficient to prevail on her to lengthen her stay; and knowing that she owed much to IKate during her recent illness, she consented. The two girls had a favorite haunt which they visited regularly. It was a sweet little dell, about a quarter of   136   THEI IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, a mile from Father John's house. Here they could ram- ble at pleasure, and enjoy each other's society without intrusion. The days of spring were yet young; but when the sun came forth with something more than his usual ardor, it was almost difficult to believe that summer had not- ap- proached. The two companions enjoyed the sweetness and fresh- ness of the season with childlike delight. Kate was a fervent worshipper of nature. ,'Not a leaf or bud, not a moss-covered stone, or neglected lichen could escape her observant eye. Everything had beauties which others failed to perceive. In this respect, Brigid was also an enthusiast, and for these reasons the dell was a great favorite. "The prettiest primrose from this to Sleamish," said Brigid, running forward to pluck the flower, which had come to a luxuriant growth, nestled amid withered leaves. Scarcely had she done so, when the report of a gun was heard near at hand. Both girls started, and looked at each other with a sort of surprised and inquiring look. "' What can that mean?" asked Kate. "' I'm sure I cannot tell," answered Brigid; " but it does appear to me to be rather strange." "Oh! now when I think of it," added Kate, "it is probably some sportsman. I think we'll turn back, Brigid."  "I think so, too," said the latter. But they had not proceeded far, when another shot was heard, followed by a most uproarious laugh. Looking toward the place whence the sounds proceed- ed, there they beheld Mike Glinty, kneeling on one knee, with a gun in his hand, and a long-handled pike lying beside him. His hat, or, rather, the article denominated by that title, was placed on a thornbush, at a distance of twenty or thirty paces.   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      137 Being bareheaded, and caught in the unlawful act of firing a gun, Mike looked rather sheepish, as Kate -and Brigid approached him. "Good morning, :Mike," said Kate. "But what, in all the world, are you doing down here?" Tit-fit-tit-trying to shoot Mim-mim-Mackenzie through th-th-th-the head," said Mike, as he pointed to his hat. "Tut, tut!-bad boy, Mike, to be engaged at such naughty work," said Brigid, advancing closer to him. " in-nin-not naughty work," insisted Mike. "If I'm- m-m nin-nin-naughty, sis-sis-so is John Mullan;" and both Kate and Brigid joined in a simultaneous laugh. "And what is this for?" inquired Kate, stooping down to look at the pike. "Did-did-don't t-t-touch that," shouted Mike, " mim- mirn-might hurt you." . "There is no fear of it hurting me," insisted Kate, who really was glad of an opportunity to examine a specimen of the favorite arm of Irish warfare. Brigid and Kate lifted and examined the pike with great curiosity, and evidently against the wish of Mike, who thought that girls should mind their own business, and leave such articles for men I "Who intrusted you, Mike, with these weapons?" l Nin-nin-nobody," he answered; "Pat sent mim-mim- me with them to-to-to old Roddy, bib-bib-but he gig-gig- gave me leave to have tit-tit-two shots at my own hat on-n-n a bib-bib-bush, and I mim-mim-must now away." As Mike prepared to depart, both Kate and Brigid would have liked to learn something about Cormac and John; but, fool and all as Mike was, these girls felt a sort of bashfulness in alluding, even remotely, to either of the young men. "What a pity," said Brigid, " he didn't speak of John or Cormac.7" "What matter?" replied Kate.   138   T'; -IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OKR, "Oh, of course not; but I just wanted to know if there was any stirring news. I'll call after Mike, Kate, and inquire." "No, no, Brigid, there's no necessity." But Brigid did make a show of following Mike, and Mike, thinking that she followed him with some design of retaining the arms intrusted to him, quickened his pace, and soon left Brigid far behind. Hle had not yet gone out of sight, when a man was seen approaching, and remain some minutes in conversation with him. Kate and Brigid both observed some angry gestures on the part of the stranger. Mike kept himself in motion, going round about as if to avoid too close a contact with the stranger. The sound of their voices could be heard, and it was plainly evident that an altercation of some sort was going on between Mike and the stranger. Sud- denly the latter made a spring on Mike, and snatched the gun from him. Mike dropped the pike, and caught his antagonist by the neck. When roused, poor Glinty was a match for any ordinary man. A scuffle ensued, during which Mike became master of the gun. Snatch- ing up the pike from the ground, the poor fellow re- treated his steps to where Brigid and Kate stood. He was closely pursued by the stranger. When Alike ap- proached the girls, he bawled out, "( Th-th-that devil-1-l Flemingwantsto-torobme. Here, Mim-mim-lMiss O'Neill, you and Brigid ji-ji-just watch these -articles fif-fif-for a minute, ti-ti-till I pitch into him." Saying which, he deposited both gun and pike on the ground, and made a spring with such force on his antagonist, as brought both of them to the ground. Mike kicked up his legs, rolled about with Fleming as if he were a bundle of straw in his arms, hitting and biting whenever he got the opportunity. Kate kept screaming at him to desist, but all was of no use. He kept Fleming pinned down to the ground,   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      139 and whenever the latter endeavored to regain his feet, Alike was sure to give him another toss. The only artic- ulate sounds heard during the encounter proceeded from Mike, who, at every blow, kept up a running volley of, "Wud ye-wud ye-wud ye?" Kate and Brigid were such interested spectators, that they did inot observe the approach of a man who was hastily crossing a field leading to the spot where Flem- ing was in the unrelenting gripe of Mike. Suddenly the man was down on the combatants, and, releasing Fleming, held him by the arm, looking straight intohs face. Mike gave a"cry of joy when he beheld Roddy Flynn, to whose house he had been commissioned to take the gun and pike. "Axnd so you would leave your lodgings, young man, before settling your bill," said Fleming's pursuer, who proceeded deliberately to bind Flemi ng's hands behind his back. Kate kept insisting on Brigid to return, but Brigid kept as persistently repeating, "Wait awhile." "Here, Mike, give us a hand," cried Roddy. Mike was quickly obedient, and assisted in tying Fleming's hands, the latter crying out, "f I'll make the whole of you rue this, yet. Your kindness was a plot, a devilish plo, 'to keep me to be murdered," he said, ad- dressing Roddy. "Ji-ji-just you-u-u be quiet, now," insisted Mike, "till you're rir-rir-roped, and then talk," and Mike laughed and giggled at a great rate. "I suppose you two young ladies saw the attempt to rob this poor fellow," said Roddy, addressing Kate and Brigid. "We saw him strike the poor fellow, and snatch some- thing from him at the same time," said Brigid, speaking for herself and Kate. "It's a lie," said Fleming, dashing a fiendish look on Brigid, which startled both girls into a speedy flight.   "O   ThiE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, But the word had scarcely passed his lips than Mike sprang at him again, and would have inflicted heavy punishment on the speaker, but for Roddy, who made him desist. "Turn now, ungrateful creature, and march back the way you came," said Roddy, addressing Fleming. "Yes, tit-tit turn now-w-w, 'grateful crea3tue, and- trot off-f-f with you th-th-the road you come," added Mike, imitating the words of Roddy. Kate and Brigid, not a little frightened at what they witnessed, returned homeward as quickly as possible. Judge their astonishment, to find John and Peter Mul- lan, Cormac Rogan and Pat Dolan, with his two sons in the kitchen, engaged in earnest conversation with Father John. After an interchange of compliments, Kate rehearsed what had taken place. Cormac looked at Pat, as much as to say, "What's best to be done?" Soldiers and yeomanry were out that day scouring the country, and danger was impending everywhere. An appeal was made to Father John for advice, but he declined, leaving those around him to be the judges of their own business. Cormac and Pat retired outside, and after a few min- utes' conversation, returned. It was arranged that Pat, accompanied by his sons and Peter Mullan, should at once proceed to follow Roddy Flynn and Mike. The carrying of arms in open day might probably bring them into trouble. Pat was not aware when he entrust- ed Mike with them, that anything could have occurred with Fleming, who would now, in all likelihood, call out for help if he saw any one near at hand, and likely to be able to render him any assistance. This arrangement was an agreeable surprise to Kate and Brigid, who never dreamed that it was made by the young men in order to afford them an interview. I   THE PTKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       14t Father John had retired to his room, and John Mullan proposed that all four should go out to enjoy a walk. Kate alleged that she and Brigid had just returned. "Of course," said Cormac, approaching, and taking the girl by the hand, "we know that, dear Kate, but come, now, and we shall shortly return." "ere are two cloaks and two hats," said John, ap- proaching these articles. "Just you alloWv them to remain there," said Brigid, saucily, seeing that John was singling hers out. "Kate has not decided yet whether we are to go out or remain within." "But, surely, Brigid O'Hara has something to say to that matter herself?" inquired John. "Nothing, whatever," replied Brigid; "I leave all such arrangements to Miss O'Neill." Kate consented, and the party went forth. For a while they walked together, but then separated; Kate and Cormac remaining behind at some distance from John and Brigid. "Matters are coming to a crisis with us," said Cormac to Kate; " we don't know the day we shall be required to take the field, and, till then, whenever it does take place, we shall be as busy as possible, and, in some places, night and day." "I was. just beginning to think as much," said Kate. "I suppose we shall not see you again for a long time." "That is what troubles me, Kate," replied the young man, taking the girl's hand; "I cannot tell anything as to how or where I shall be situated. I am under orders. and shall follow them. I may mention to you that the late numerous arrests made by the Government have somewhat disheartened and distracted the leaders here in the North. The Commander-in-Chief of the insurgent forces, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, is not sure of his life a single day, and, after to-morrow, I shall be engaged be- tween Belfast and here as dispatch carrier." *   "2   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, ,Kate leaned heavily on Cormac's arm, and the young man interpreted that to a feeling of anxiety as to his safety. "And has my dear Kate so little to say??" said Corma/c, in his most familiar manner. Kate was silent. "I thought to find you remarkably glad to see your friend Cormac, and to wish him all sorts of good luck, and give him lots of promises of fidelity, and-"' I was glad to see you, Cormac," replied Kate, "and wish you all sorts of good luck; but as to my promises of fidelity--" "s Excuse me, Kate," said Cormac. "Yes, yes-I know," said the girl, " it was only banter. You shall have all I can give you-my heart's love, and prayers for your safety, and for the triumph of the cause you are engaged in." Cormac stopped walking, and, turning round a little, gazed into the sweet and truthful eyes that met his with a loving tenderness. "Kate," he said-and he evidently spoke with emotion, for his voice trembled--"I am poor, at least moderately so; I am engaged in the cause of my country--" "And of my country," eagerly said Kate. "Yes, of our country, Kate; but independently of my poverty, should I come safely through the trials which -are common to all those engaged in the same good cause, I shall then, dear Kate, be able to lay before you, for your acceptance, an undivided heart, and the labor of a life which shall be yours till death." The earnestness of Cormac's language, his manner, which amounted to enthusiasm, and the kind, loving look of his face penetrated deeper than ever into the pure soul of the half-silent, gifted girl, who stood before him. She felt the full influence of the truth that beamed from his every look; and her clasp of his hand was a suf- 'l   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       143 ficient index of the goodness and faithfulness of her own heart. "I can only hope, Cormac," she said, " that you shall ever find me worthy of your manly and unselfish love." Tears filled her eyes as she spoke. She would have said more, but that suppressed language which appears, although not spoken, beaming in every look, plainly con- veyed to her accepted lover the fulness of her heart. "But see, Cormac, we are far behind John Mullan and Brigid. Let us overtake them." Cormac paid no attention to this gentle reminder. He walked along with his head half bent, half sorrowful looking, and somewhat dejected. "You hear what I have said," repeated Kate; " we are lagging behind. See, John and Brigid await us." "Pardon me," returned Cormac; "we shall shortly overtake them." In a few minutes our party joined. "This is rather a friendly sort of walk," said Brigid. "It was your fault," answeredl Kate, "you walk so quickly at times." "And Miss O'Neill walks so confoundedly slow, some- times, you know," said Brigid, addressing John. "You are a better judge, Brigid, of the pace at which Miss O'Neill walks than I am, or can pretend to be." "Quick or slow, here or there, I think we are all to blame; or, rather, none of us are to blame," said Cormac. "We shall return, then," said Kate. They did so; and this time it was John and Brigid who were behind. It is almost unnecessary to repeat what took place between them. The light-hearted girl was serious looking; so was John Mullan. Arrived at Kate's residence, they all entered; but as yet there was no appearance of the other party. Father John was present, and all were laughing and chatting, when' Mike Glinty entered, the tears rolling down his cheeks.   "4   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON,1 OR, Captain Mackenzie and his black yeos were out. Rod- dy Flynn, Pat Dolan, Phil and Ned, and Peter Hullan were taken prisoners, and were now on their way to An- trim. "Quick, Jack. Let us be off; we can call at the smid- dy. There is a meeting there to-day. This looks like work," said Cormac. There was a hurried hand-shaking; and neither Mul- lan nor Rogan heard the prayers that Kate and Brigid offered at their departure. \,   21af 1ItKKERIN OP NgiETY-EIGHT,    145 CHAPTER XX.

PAT Dolan had only proceeded about a mile and a half on his journey when he saw Roddy and Mike ascend a hill. Fleming was walking in advance. Suddenly he ran forward, and two men approached him, then five or six others; and Pat hurried forward. Fleming was quickly released, while Roddy and Pat Dolan were immediately put iunder arrest. Pat's sons and Peter Mullan were permitted to go away; but, at the instigation of Fleming, they were re- called, and also put under arrest. Mike retreated with the swiftness of a deer and was fired at. The party then marched forward, and in the course of a short time, were reinforced by additional members of the yeomanry corps under Mackenzie. Fleming's hilar- ity knew no bounds. He informed Mackenzie that he was taken prisoner by a body of United men one even- ing when returning after a patrol. Roddy heard him, and knowing that such was not true told him " not to sin his soul with a parcel of lies. You know," said Roddy, "hat you were found wounded, 10   "6   ai' IRISE WIDOW'S SON; OR, nd that after taking care of you for severalweeks, and attending to your recovery, you ran off to-day without so much as saying, by your leave. rm poor man, anl as I thought I was entitled to something for all my trouble, I followed you to make you return."

"No, I don't think it, I now it;" answere d Flem- ing            ang detrne- Mackenzie then gave the word to halt, and turned his men in another direction. Pat and the others saw that their chances of escape were thus lessened by that order; however,they never betrayed the slightest uneasiness at the turn of ill-luck. Peter ]ullan showed an undoubted stubbornness, which subjeoted him to a good deal of violence atthe hands of his captors. Phil and Ned Dolan were more guarded, and learned by a few glances from their father, that their better p!an was not to speak, and to appear to treat the whole thing with indifference. Their father began to whistle some: popular air, but was instantly ordered to stop. Roddy Flynn kept up his banter with Fleming, main- taining that this-referring to his being made prisoner- was a poor reward for all he had done for Fleming, from the night that he found him all but dead, and kindly took him intohis house. Fleming at last began to think that probably he had   THEV PTKEIMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     147 been over hasty in his suspicions of Roddy; however, in order to be on the safe side, he did not allude further to that part of the business. Cormac and John were not long in arriving at the smiddy. The meeting was over, but some ten or twelve young men were loitering about, smoking and chat- ting. To these Cormac immediately issued instructions, and told them what had befallen Dolan and his sons, and John's brother. Mike had inadvertantly conveyed word to Pat's wife and daughter. The latter ran out of the house half dis- tracted, and besought Cormac Rogan to hasten to her father's assistance. "And poor Peter," she exclaimed. " Oh, I see how it will be. They'll be taken, and once that villain, Mac- kenzie, gets his toils around them!" and the poor girl ran up and down half frantically, shouting, "Oh, my father, my poor father!" "Sis-sis-send Mackenzie  after Cic-cic-cic-Cameron, by the-hokey," shouted Mike, as he witnessed the girl's suf- ferings. "Come on, lads," shouted Corinac, after he had arrang- ed his men. Naturally enough, Cormac took the road on which he expected to meet Mackenzie and his prisoners; but after travelling a good distance he found, to his great grief, that he had missed them. Undecided as to whathe should now do, Cormac felt wofully perplexed. How happy he felt only a few hours ago, and now he was perfectly miserable. His heart yearned for action against the en. emies of his country, and all these were enemies, bitter enemies of his creed, although there were many brave and noble hearts engaged in the same movement with + himself who differed from him in religious opinion. After a short consultation with. a few of the leading spir- t^    "8    "E IRISH WIDOW'S SON; On, its that surrounded him, Cormac ventured on the bold expedient of turning, and by another route enter An- trim. For this purpose he divided his men into parties, of twos and threes, and these he sent in different direc- tions, but in such a manner as to be within easy distance of each other. The plan succeeded, for immediately on entering the town, Cormac perceived Mackenzie and his prisoners entering by a narrow way adjoining Shaixe's Castle de- mesne. A sharp whistle collected his men, and Mac- kenzie immediately found himself surrounded by Cor- mac's party. To show fight was the thing farthest from Mackenzie or his men, for their chances of victory were not only doubtful, but their lives likely to be imperilled. As Cormac approached, Mackenzie addressed him:- "In open violation of the laws of the country, I find that you, sir, and your followers, are about to forbid my passage with these prisoners." "In open violation of the laws of the country!" replied Cormac, with a bitter sneer. "It is you, sir, and your cowardly minions, who violate and outrage every law." Here Roddy Flynn cut a caper on the road, which very much resembled an inclination to dance a jig. "Come here, my fine runaway," he said, grasping Flem- ing by the arm. "Never you run away again, till you pay' your lodging money, you thief that you are! When my wife gets hold of you, she will--' "Hold," said Cormac, after a short parley with John Mullar and Peter Dolan. "Captain Mackenzie," he added, "s consider yourself, and these men who accompany you, my prisoners. You will require to retrace your 'steps for some distance; on your acquiescence to my or- ders depends your own and the lives of others." Mackenzie appeared irresolute; observing which, Pat Dolan pointed the way, desiring the men to move for- ward. Fleming had the hue of despair in his face, and   THE PIKEMEN    OF NINETY-EIGHT.  149 his good looks were not restored by the banter ofRoddy Flynn. On their backward route, Cormac was joined by about fifty men, so that the capture of Iaokenzie as- sumed the character of a demonstration. The people turned out of theirhouses, and gave vent to their feelings in loud cheers. Hang every man of them!", was shouted from many a lusty throat. Cormac had taken the precaution to proceed with his prisoners through by-roads and places not often trav- ersed by the general public.' He had arranged with lullan and Dolan to take them on towards the middy There was an old house in the vicinity, and in that house disposed rac determined the prisoners should be kept, and disposed of according to orders from headquarters. He knew, right well, that the report would soon spread that Mackenzie had been arrested, and therefore it became necessary to send intelligence of the event as quickly as possible to Belfast. Arrived at the place, Cormac informed Makenzie that he should remain in the place selected for their deten- tion. A proper guard would be placed over the house, and the penalty of theslightest attempt at esape, would, on discovery, be immediately followed by death to the Party so attempting. Mackenzie  was silent and morose. Afterhis capture he spoke very little, either to h is captors or to his own nen. -   "This is an important piece of work," said Cormac to ohn, after their prisoners had been properly attended to "tThere cannot be a doubt of it," replied M ullan; , , but we may make up our minds for ho   t w ork, immediately after it is discovered iately I k now it well," replied Cormac, thoug.

Shortly afterwards, Cormac proceeded on his mission. It was late when he arrived in Belfast, and, in conse- quence, required to act with exceeding caution. Meetings were then being held every night in differ- ent parts of the town, and especially in the suburbs. These meetings seldom consisted of more than five or six persons, and were not unfrequently held in utter darkness. Cormac proceeded to a certain rendezvous, where he expected to find either McCracken or Milliken. After some difficulty, he obtained permission to enter, and was not a little surprised to find himself surrounded by others whose number he did not know, and whose faces he could not see. He gave the password correctly, and, on that account, was admitted. Finally, he began to think that he had fallen into some trap, when, a light being procured, he found himself among a party of - seven men, sitting round a small table, in the basement story of an old house. For some minutes Cormac was undecided how to pro- ceed. At last, he determined to take his leave, but im- mediately on attempting to do so, was peremptorily ordered, by what appeared to be the chairman of the company, to be seated, and make known his business. This he declined to do, merely stating that he came there in expectation of seeing a certain gentleman, and not finding him, he did not care to remain. The company looked into each other's faces with a sort of undecided look. Some of them glancing furtively at Cormac, made him feel anything but easy in his position. "We must learn the exact nature of your business here," said one of the party to Cormac, in a tone of voice not very assuring. "The exact nature of my business you shall notlearn;'   THEE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      151 replied Cormac, most emphatically. "I have already told you," he continued, " that I came here expecting to see a gentleman whom I knew, and not finding him here, I wish to leave." "What's his name, young man?" inquid one of the party, rather mildly.       J "Mr. Israel Milliken," answered Cormac. "Is your business with Mr. Milliken of such a nature that it cannot be postponed until to-morrow; or, have you any objection to make it known, and it will be con- veyed to him?" "It cannot be postponed; and I will not make it known till I see him," said Cormac. The others whispered together for a minute, when one of them turned to Cormac, and told him that a messen- ger would be dispatched at once to bring Mr. Milliken; but if he' could not be had, and there were some doubts regarding that, they hoped the young man would recon- sider his determination, and make known his business. These were not times when a person might intrude him- self, although he was possessed of a pass-word, and learn anything transpiring at such meetings as the pres- ent. They presumed that " it was all right " with the young man; but he himself knew he was a stranger among them, and if he w'ere what they all believed him to be, he would readily consent to make known his mission, or, at least, a part of it, so as to convince them that they were right in admitting him. Cormac felt there was some good reason in all this. He was guarded in all his acts, and why should they not be the same? Yes; he was quite agreeable to their proposal. A messenger was then sent for Mr. Ii'lliken. He had not been more than a few minutes gone, when the sound of footsteps were heard approaching the door. The   tJMi  IRISH WIDOW S SON ; OR, light was quietly extinguished, and Cormac thought he could distinguish a movement, as if those present were secretly retiring, either into some other apartment, or leaving the house by some secret door. This had the reverse tendency of assuring him tiat he was yet in safe quarters. In a few seconds, however, he was delighted to hear the sound of McCracken's voice. The light was suddenly restored, and Cormac beheld his friend engaged in a hearty hand-shaking with all present. On recognizing Cormac, McCracken was instantly be- side him, inquiring after his health, and how matters were proceeding about Antrim and Randalstown. Cormac -was not long making known to him the na- ture of his business. Judge of McCracken's astonishment, at hearing from Cormac a confirmation of the news he had just received not half an hour ago. McCracken immediately made known to all present what he had just learned. " But my astonishment to find that our young friend here, was the cause whereby MIac- kenzie was made prisoner," said McCracken, "almost overwhelms me." The men sprang from their seats, and jostled each other in their anxiety to get hold of Cormac's hand. From doubts and doubting, there immediately sprang hearty congratulations and praises of the intrepidity of Cormac. The latter detailed his fears and anxieties since he en- tered, much to the enjoyment of all present; while the members of the company were nothing backward in de- tailing theirs; and some of them even went so far as to tell Cormac the plans they were revolving in their minds to make Cormac either confess the nature of his busi- ness, or force him to an involuntary stay beyond his in- clinations. Just then the messenger returned in company with    THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      153 Mr. M-illiken; and if Cormac stood high in the estimation of those present since the arrival of McCracken, he stood higher still since Mr. Milliken saw him. The latter informed Cormac, that, owing to new ar- rangements concerning Antrim, the removal of Mac- kenzie was of the utmost importance.    154   T1HE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; -OR CT APTER X x {.

"There's no one within, but Peggy." Peter and Mike both entered. "Your fif-fif-fif-father wasn't long a prisoner," said Mike; " nin-nin-nor Peter Mullan either," he added, ad- dressing Peggy. "No, Mike; thanks to Cormac and John, they were speedily and unexpectedly released." "Thanks tit-tit-to Cormac and John!"Mike sneeringly repeated.

"Had it not been for your pair of speedy heels, the whole of them would have been, by this time, in a worse place than that occupied by Mackenzie." Peggy and Peter agreed that Mike was the chief cause of the rescue; and the poor fellow, always keenly alive to his own merits, felt delighted at this recognition of his services. .,? "It is a long time, I suppose," said Peggy, addressing Peter Mullan, " since you saw Miss O'Hara?" "Who, Brigid?" said Peter. "No; not very long. She is stopping, I believe, with Kate O'Neill and her uncle." "Yes; I heard that. Then you're not as regular a vis- itor there as when she was stopping at home at her fa- thers?" "Regular visitor!" said Peter, with the least degree of astonishment. "I don't think I ever was twice in the house." "Oh, indeed! I thought I heard some one say that you and she were very- intimate," said Peggy. "It is the first time I ever heard that said," replied Pe- ter. "What led you to think so?" he inquired. "I didn't think anything about it. I only say, that I heard that Mr. Mullan and Miss O'Hara were on very in- timate terms." "Oh! I see, I see," exclaimed Peter, laughing; "very likely, indeed. But you forget there are two of that name, Peggy." "No," said the girl, "I don't forget anything of the kind; but I always thought it was you, Peter, and, in- deed, I wondered at it, for Miss O'Hara condescended to speak of you rather slightingly at one time." "When?" eagerly inquired the young man. "I am not very sure, now," was the answer; " but I be- lieve it was shortly after the time I saw you at Antrim fair."   -156  mTHE IRISH WIDOW'S SON     Oa, "Quite so; I remember it right well," said Peter, laughing heartily. "I left you and your father, you re- member, behind me, and hurried on homeward." "Yes; that is the very time," said Peggy. '"I overtook Brigid, and very kindly asked her to take a seat in the cart. She was evidently displeased at some- thing; and what do you think, but I believed her to be quite jealous of you that very night, Peggy." "Dear me! how in all the world could she be jealous of me, Peter? I'm sure she never had any cause." -"Not the slightest, I know; but I just happened, in answer to her inquiry of what detained me, to say that 1 had been kept behind a little, speaking to you and your father," said Peter. "And surely that couldn't have annoyed her?" "Not at all," replied Peter, still laughing at the recol- lection of the mistake that occurred on that evening, when Brigid believed she was in company with John. Peter rehearsed the whole circumstance, and Peggy listened with evident pleasure to the recital, not in the least displeased at Peter thinking of Brigid's jealousy when he mentioned Peggy's name. What small things please us at some time of our lives. Peter was long anxious to get on intimate terms with Peggy Dolan; and, especially since that evening, when, in presence of her father, he kindly drank to her "very good health," and hoped, when she married, her choice would fall on a young fellow worthy of her. Probably Peter never uttered five words in all his life that partook of so much gallantry. Peggy's kind glances was the inspiriting cause, and, as his opportunities in that way had been very limited, so, in like manner, his tongue was seldom eloquent. Even yet he was not quite sure of his position toward Peggy, but the freeness of her speech gave him great hope that he was not altogether unacceptable to her.   T'HE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      157 As for Peggy, she had long since harbored some sort of a not unpleasant feeling toward Peter. She could not exactly explain what it was, but she found herself often indulging in it, and wondering why she did so. Yet this pair of young people would not, for any con- sideration, have made known to each other the workings of their own hearts, each dreading that a want of reci- procity might thereby become known, and so destroy the day-dreams in which they loved to indulge. When Peter drew his seat closer to Peggy's, she did not even attempt to forbid him the exercise of such fa- miliarity. Gently sliding his arm around Peggy's waist, he looked right into the girl's eyes, and, after a pause, said: "Peggy, I love you!" The girl naturally thought that something was ex- pected of her in return, and artlessly she replied, with her head bent, "And I, dear Peter, love you, too." And this was the full and unsophisticated courtship of Peggy Dolan and Peter Mullan. True, they had known each other for a considerable time, and probably had, on more than one occasion, investigated the state of their hearts toward each other; but further than this they had not ventured. The readiness to acknowledge what they felt, one to the other, somewhat astonished the pair after their mutual avowal. Peter believed that nothing could be more difficult -than to act asihe did, and now he wondered at getting over the matter so easily. Peggy would have fainted only one hour ago, if any person had told her she would so readily accept the ad- vances of Peter. Now, however, when all was over, she thought nothing of it, not even the plain avowal of her love for him, a thing she would have carefully avoided had she been a skilled or proficient prude. But neither one nor the other ever imagined such a thing. They were alike ignorant of the cunning and selfish manner of those who were trained in the world's ways,   158   THUE^ IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, Peter was aboutfto take his leave-just as Peggy's father entered. "You may rest yourself contentedly, if you like," said Pat Dolan, addressing Peter.  "Our boys beyond there," he continued, nodding his head in the direc- tion of Mackenzie's place of safety, "are carefully watched and attended to." Peter resumed his seat, expressing his anxiety for Cor- mac's return. "I, too, wish he were here,' responded Pat. "We don't know the minute when the iwhole country may be up about our ears in consequence of what has hap- pened." "The people themselves are all right; at least the great- est part of them," said Peter, " and anything else must happen through the soldiers or some others of the yeo- manry." "Yes, that's quite true," Pat replied. "Here comes John." John entered, and casting a knowing glance at the proximity of Peggy's seat toward Peter's, laughingly re- marked, "Both comfortably seated, I perceive." 'I was just about remarking something of the same thing," said Pat, quietly; " but that Peter was in the act of leaving when I entered, I suppose he resumed the seat he had just quitted before I came in." Peggy sprang to her feet and made to rush into a room, but Peter gallantly detained her, telling her to never mind his brother's nonsense. It was evident, however, from the appearance of both Peter and Peggy, that they had been engaged in some sort of conversation that had nothing unpleasant about it. The three men engaged in conversation, and Peggy re- tired. Mike had betaken himself to the place where Mackenzie waslocated, half suspicious that matters could            .

Mike could never be made to believe that danger was absent whenever Cormac was not there to superin- tend everything himself. "We can form no opinion,-I presume," said John Mul- lan, " of the nature of Cormac's instructions concerning the disposal of our party?" ".No, not easily," replied Pat; "but I hope they'll be removed from this quarter, soon and sudden. I have a sort of feeling in my mind that their capture might up- set a good- many of our plans unless things are wisely managed." "I wish to goodness there had been a fight before we got them this length," said Peter, emphatically. "That would only have made matters worse," replied his brother. "Most decidedly," insisted Pat. a Besides, they were far too few. What would five or six men be to our num- ber?"  "Quite so," added John. "I hope, too, that Cormac may have some further news home with him." "The very thought that was in my own mind," cried Pat. "He will doubtless have heard something as to how matters are proceeding in another quarter." "You mean Dublin?" inquired John. "Yes." "I would fain hope so." Mike came in with word that some of Mackenzie's fel- lows were fighting among themselves. One of the men on guard told him to bring the word. "This is a ruse," said John, rising to leave. Pat agreed with him, but thought it would do no harm to go in and see how things were getting on. Peter was also about to leave, but Peggy, hearing John and her father speak of going, came into the kitchen, seeing which, Peter remained.   160   1THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, To John's inquiry, one of his own party told him that angry words had passed between some of the men. One of them told Mackenzie it was all his fault. "Shall we go in?" inquired Pat, speaking to John. "Yes, we'll both enter." ' They did so, and as the door opened, one of the men made a rush, as if to escape. He was a tall and power- fully-built man, but Mullan sprang before him, and threw him with full force upon the ground. Mackenzie merely looked on, but did not interfere. "Try that game again," said Dolan, " and by heavens, I'll give you the contents of this," presenting a horse- pistol at- the fellow's head. "And, moreover," contin- ued Pat, "if there be any attempt at kicking up a row, or making any noise, it will be worse for those attempt- ing the like." Both left after locking the door, and placing their guards in proper positions. Scarcely had they done so, when they observed two men corning toward them at a rapid pace. For a few moments, Dolan felt somewhat annoyed. "I think," he said, addressing John, " that man on the near side, is Cormac." Pat was right. Cormac and Milliken approached, and shook hands heartily with John and Pat.   THE PIKKEMFN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      161 CHAPTER X   1. THE GREEN FLAG OF IRELAND--MT-WE GLNTY7S DE- "GHT AT BEHOLDING IT---HOW IT WAS PRESSi'JiD AND REC]EIVE"D. "Drink the faithful hearts that love us, 'Did to-morrow's thickest fight; While our Green Flag floats above us, Think, boys, 'tis for them we smite." A LARGE meeting was convened for that night, at which Milliken insisted that a strict guard should be kept on Mackenzie and his party. It was just possible that an exchange of prisoners would take place erxe long between the people of Ireland and the British govern- ment; and, in that case, the body of Mackenzie would turn out to be of some value. He strongly recommend- ed the utmost vigilance and secrecy. Matters were fast ripening, and he doubted not, but the hour would soon be at hand when every Irishman, who wished to prove his devotion to his country, would have an opportunity of trying the issue of battle with his country's enemies. Great enthusiasm prevailed, and the men, according to custom at separating, broke into squads of twenty-five, to go through their drill exercise. Mike Glinty was on his high horse with excitement, as he watched Pat Dolan go through his work with his men. "Right about, wheel, quick-march l" were words charged with electricity for poor Glinty. Neither was he alone in this respect. The men's hearts beat high "   [E IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, with hope and gladness as they engaged in their work, and little wonder, either. What work so noble as the preparation and training to defend or to rescue one's country? The world has never yet beheld a nobler picture, than that of the soldier who prepares to battle to the death in behalf of his fatherland. Pat Dolan felt this, so did Cormac, so did John Mul- lan, so did they all; and it must be confessed that Kate O'Neill, Brigid O'Hara, and even Peggy Dolan, were un- der its influence also, and that no small portion of their love arose from the fact that these young men were prominently and ardently engaged in working for their c.ountry's redemption. The missing of Mackenzie and his party had caused considerable stir among the yeomanry and government authorities. They left nothing undone to ferret out their whereabouts, but every effort proved abortive. With one or two trifling exceptions, spies and inform- ers were nearly unknown. A:s time wore on, it was evi- dent the government knew not the hour in which the in- surrection would break forth. Nothing was left undone to reach the heads of the conspiracy. Secret service money was freely lavished about, and pensions and pro- motions held temptingly forward to induce the recreant and weak-minded to aid the corrupted minions of Dub- lin Castle. Thus has it been down to our own day, and thus shall it ever be. England and Ireland will never live contentedly to- gether; and the sooner the unnatural connexion ceases, the better it will be for all concerned.

Father John hoped they were equally attentive to their prayers as they were to their self-imposed tasks. "Prayer without good works," said Brigid O'Hara, "don't avail much." "There are those living," replied Father John, "who would quickly venture to dispute the term 'good,' to the work you are at present engaged in performing." "There were those," replied Brigid,." who could see no good even in Him who was the essence of every good itself." "Well done, Brigid," said Kate, "that finishes the whole business; but Uncle John is not one of those who believe we are not engaged in a good work." "Far be it from me," said the kind old man, "and I only wish that every girl in the Province of Ulster, could claim kindred in patriotic intention, and act with the girls I see before me." "And, oh how I wish from my heart, that every girl could boast of an uncle like mine," exclaimed Kate with wonderful animation. "Then, indeed, would our young men and maidens be animated with one love and one hope in the impending struggle." "The sentiment is well expressed, and does credit to the speaker," said Cormac, as he entered the place, accom- panied by John Mullan and Mike Glinty. Mike had guessed the route the young men were taking and followed them. Kate and Brigid were startled, and hastily rising from their seats, endeavored to conceal the work they had just then finished.   164   'Tm   IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "We expected you had gone to Belfast, and would not return for some time;' said Brigid, addressing John Mullan. "No," he answered, "Cormac took that job into his own hands, and has fulfilled his mission." "We heard all about it," Father John declared. "And what arrangements have you made concerning the safety of Mackenzie?" he asked. Cormac informed him, adding, that the leading men of Belfast were so pleased with what occurred, that they left the entire -arrangement and management of Mac- kenzie to himself, and those who belonged to his party. "He is a bad man, full of evil intentions," said the priest. "Many a sorrow he has brought into the homes of the poor, and I myself would advise his strict deten- tion, but that no harm should come to him," kindly added Father John. "He-he bib-bib-burn-n-ned poor-r-r sis-sis-Sally's house, fif-fif-for' cic-cic-calling him a brute," said Mike, quite fiercely. "Oh, many a home he left desolate, poor fellow," re- plied the priest, laying his hand familiarly on Mike's shoulder. "But we must not think too much of these things, for there is a Power before which Mackenzie and all such must one day render an account." "Aye! bib-bib-but th-th-that day did-did-don't frighten Mackenzie, nin-nin-nor Fleming, fif-fif-for the day is- tit- tit-too far off;," remarked Mike, looking steadfastly on all around him. "I don't know," said Father John, anxious to change the current of Mike's thoughts, " whether I should men- tion that Kate and Brigid were preparing a little surprise for Cormac and John, and for Mike too," the priest added, anxious to conciliate the outspoken poor fellow, whose heart beat as warmly as that of any present. ' Oh, nonsense," cried Kate, "never heed uncle John.   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      165 ]He only wants to create expectations in your mind, Cormac. We, were but amusing ourselves. Brigid was anxious to---" "Oh, Kate," remonstrated Brigid. "It was you first thought of it. Now wasn't it, Father John??" she said, appealing to the clergyman. "Upon my word," rejoined the latter, "if there is any difference as to who thought first of the work, I don't know it; both have shown the same anxiety regarding it, and both have wrought at it with a will." "You but stimulate Cormac's curiosity, and my own, said John Mullan. "At first I imagined you had some little feast prepared for us." "There now, I knew it," said Father John. "Get ready, girls, quick; spread the table, and Mike and I shall see that the kettle soon boils." Mike at once busied himself, and in a few minutes Kate had the table set. Tea was speedily prepared, and our party was shortly afterwards enjo ing the hospitali- ties of Father John's humble board. After tea, Kate produced a beautiful green flag, the result of her own and Brigid's handiwork. "Oh, hokey-by the Lord!" rapidly exclaimed Mike, with unusual fervor, and the speaker sprang to his feet, dancing around the room and gesticulating in the most singular manner. Kate and Brigid could not help laughing at Mike's an- tics. As the flag lay unfolded before them, with a beautiful harp wrought in yellow silk on the green field, and sur- rounded with shamrocks beautifully interlaced, Cormac and John were equally struck with admiration. There may be many such like," exclaimed Cormac, "unfolded in the presence of the blood-stained flag of our enemies; but this one shall be dyed in gore ere it falls into the hands of a foe of Ireland." "To that, I say, Amen!" cried John Mullan.   166-  Tr1   IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "Tit-tit-ten Amens, echoed Mike, touching the flag with his finger gently, here and there, and expressing his admiration of it after his own fashion, but in a man- ner to indicate his feelings. "I only hope," Father John remarked, "that there will come a day when Ireland will indeed have a flag of its own, acknowledged and saluted in every clime, and floating proudly on every sea." "Such a day we hopefully pray for,' added Kate O'- Neill. And such a day we should hopefully fight for l" said Brigid O'Hara, with her hand uplifted., Cormac was delighted, and John was overjoyed. "It would be a grievous pity to receive such a present, and from, such a pair of girls, without others to be pre- sent"' said John; " and if you have no objection, Father John, I shall go off for awhile and return shortly with a company of musketeers and pikemen, as fine a body of brave fellows as twenty parishes round about can pro- duce." "Ha, hal" cried Brigid, "that, now, is something like you. Of course, Father John will consent, for we'llllall consent, and Miss O'Neill will present the flag." Kate could not help laughing at the animation of Father John had no particular objection to offer, and John Mullan started off, accompanied by Mike. 'Pat Dolan, Phil and Ned, Peter Mullan, and all those who could be gathered at a short notice, were speedily collected by Mullan, and being informed of the business for which they were required, soon put themselves into order, and with John at their head, marched in military style toward Father McAuley's. The boldness of John in venturing on giving permis- sion for flutes and drums to be used, had the effect of collecting a larger number than he had anticipated. He   THE PTK'iEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     167 did not even thinkr of this part of the programme when he left Cormac, and, accordingly, could not tell whether it would be agreeable or otherwise. Young men belonging to the organization heard the sound of the drums, and many of them hastened to join their comrades, not a few believing that the long prom- ised hour of a call to arms had then arrived. Such were speedily informed of the nature of the business going forward, but their spirits were nothing damped by the intelligence. On they came, with hearts buoyant, and with firm and steady tread. Arrived at Father McAuley's, John drew up his men with the sharp command, "Halt." Kate and Brigid, Cormac and Father John, came forth, and were received with three thundering cheers. Kate stepped forward, leaning on Cormac's arm. Her face was flushed, and her eye gleamed with unwonted brilliancy. Taking the flag in her hand and unfolding it, another and more thrilling cheer, broke forth, as the men beheld their own immortal green! "My brave countrymen," said Kate, with a voice trembling with emotion, "with heartfelt -pleasure and pride, I present you with this token of love and hope, the joint work of Miss O'Hara and myself. We cannot share your fortunes, in the hour of peril, when confront- ing the enemies of our country and race. Let this stand- ard remind you that the daughters of Ireland will pray, with heartfelt earnestness, that it may never be lowered or dishonored while it waves in presence of a foe." Cormac received the flag amid reiterated cheering. Father John, whose eyes were moist with tears, spread forth his hands, and implored a blessing on all before him. The men uncovered their heads and knelt, while the aged priest besought the blessing of heaven on every enterprise intended to benefit their country.   168   .THJ IRISH  WIDOW'S SON; OR, Cormac returned thanks for the men. He doubted -not but that the flag presented to them under such fa- vorable circumstances, would often lead them on to vic- tory! John Mullan also addressed a- few kindly words to his comrades, and the body of men separated, the flag being entrusted to the keeping of Pat Dolan's sons. Shortly afterwards John and Cormac took their leave, Kate's hand resting softly in Cormac's, as he took his leave.   THE PTKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     169 CTTAPTER   xxl f. PAT DOLAORS MSSION-GENERAL ORDER FOR THE RIS- ING--CORH(AC'S WISH REATTZED. "What deeds we vowed to the dear old land I What solemn words we spoke: How never we'd cease, or sleep in peace, Till we shattered the stranger's yoke; And not with a storm of windy words, But many a soldier stroke." WITH the rank and file of the United Irishmen, all went bravely on. Nothing could daunt them in their arduous and toilsome work. In the majority of cases,. they knew little, if anything, of the leaders of the national move- ment. Whatever they did know, was fromcommonreport and conjecture. Some of the heaviest blows sustained by the imprison- ment of the leaders, were either unknown, or carefully concealed from the mass of the people, lest the knowl- edge should discourage them. Russell, who was originally intended to head the forces in Down, was imprisoned in Newgate, Dublin, with Em- met, McNevin, Sweetman, O'Connor, Jackson, Bond, and others. But the most fatal blow to the whole organiza- tion was the capture and death of Lord Edward Fitzger- ald. Up till within a few days of the rising in Antrim, it was not known, only partially, that Henry Joy McCrack- en was to be commander of the insurgent forces. Inde- pendently of this, however, the men intended for the field kept steadily at their drill.   170   TL fl RISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, There was a dangerous lull, or cessation, in the out rages committed by the yeomanry. Many of the soldiers who had been living at " free quarters " on the farmers, were recalled to the camp at Blaris Moor, others to Bel- fast, and some to Antrim. This proved- that the Government were in some way or other in possession of the secrets of the insurgents. Cormac Rogan had had another interview with Mc- Cracken, and received from him an appointment as cap- tain in the Randalstown district. Cormac, in his turn, appointed Pat Dolan and John Mullan to commands in the same companies with him- self. - Byinstructions from headquarters, he was to place a secret guard on the vaults adjoining Shane's Castle, and to point out the place to Colonel Samuel Orr, as soon as the latter would call upon him. This officer was brother to William Orr, then. lately executed at Carrick- fergus. About a fortnight after Cormac's appointment, he was privily waited on by the Rev. Mr. Porter, accompanied by Orr, and some other leading rebels. Pat*Dolan and John Mullan were commissioned to proceed with a guard to Mr. Porter's residence, where his servant-maid would point out to them the hiding- place of -two pieces of cannon, six-pounders, which had been concealed in his meeting-house. Dolan proceeded on his mission carefully, and suc- ceeded in passing through Antrim town to the appointed rendezvous with his supply of artillery. This was a hazardous undertaking; but Dolan showed not only his pluck, but displayed his wisdom in the necessary arrangements. When he got possession of the field-pieces, he had them carelessly thrown into a cart, with a few farming implements along with them, and about as much hay as would feed a horse. He sent his men forward in twos   ,THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-E1IGHT.     17 and threes, detailing them to certain positions on the outskirts of Antrim. Having carefully placed a pair of loaded pistols in a belt, which he wore concealed under the waisthands of his trousers, he flung off his coat, and throwing it into the cart, sprang in himself, and apply- ing the whip, proceeded on his way. On he went, quite boldly, as if encgaged in his daily occupation. A less daring course would doubtless have subjected him to suspicion, perhaps worse. He shortly afterwards arrived safely with his charge, and, by instructions, deposited them in a place of safe keeping. McCracken's previous imprisonment threw the government authorities completely off their guard, so that they never dreamed that he would endanger his safety so far as to hold the position he then held. In his efforts to have some of the Armagh Orangemen punished for their barbarous conduct toward poor and unoffending Catholics, he 6arned the ill-will of the mag- istracy. This rather urged him on to his patriotic course, and filled him with the strongest desires to overthrow the galling despotism under which his country labored. He was now busily engaged in concentrating his forces, and giving directions to all under his command how to act. He encouraged them by every possible means within his power, while he himself was encouraged by his noble- hearted sister, and other members of his family. With the keen eye of a commander, fitted in every respect for the due performance of the responsible duties devolving upon him, he saw the necessity of making a bold dash in the first pla e on the town of Antrim. That town was garrisoned by the Royalists,- and was supported by the garrisons at Belfast and Blaris Moor. So long as Antrim was so held, there was no probability of the Insurgents making a good stand at the begin- ning of their campaign; or, of co-operating with those in   J 172   THE  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, Derry and Donegal. Antrim must, therefore, fall at the outset. McCracken accordingly made known his views to the rebel leaders. Some were satisfied of the correctness of his views; others were not very sanguine of the success of an attack on such a stronghold, and recommended a desultory warfare at the beginning-. The majority, however, yielded to his plans, and DIc- Cracken accordingly issued the following order:-- "ARMY OF ULSTER-To-morrow we march on Antrim;- drive the garrison of Randalstown before you; and haste to form a junction with the Commander-in-Chief. HENRY JOY MCCRACIKEN. First Year of Liberty, 6th day of June, 1798.2' His plan was to enter the town with four columns, one from Templepatrick and vicinity, starting from a point two miles south of Mr. Porter's house. This column was to enter Antrim by the Belfast road. The second from Ballynure, and Doagh, to enter by the Car- rickfergus road. This column was to join the first con- tingent at a point called the Scotch quarter. The third was to arrive from Connor, Kells, and Ballymena, and to enter by a place called Paty's Lane. The fourth, in which were Cormac Rogan, John and Peter Mullan, and Pat Dolan and his sons, was from Shane's Castle, Randals- town, and Dunvilty, and was to enter by Bow Lane. The first three were to make their attack at half-past two o'clock, and the fourth, under the command' of Orr, to join shortly afterward. The whole country was now fairly aroused. The Brit- ish forces in Antrim were not in the best of spirits. General Nugent, who was in command of the whole of the north of Ireland, issued orders at once for the rein- forcement of the garrison,-and the second light bat- talion, consisting of the 64th regiment, the light com- panies of the Dublin, Armagh, Monaghan, Tipperary,   Trl't PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.    173 and Kerry militia, then stationed at Blaris, were ordered to proceed at once to the scene of action. They were joined by one hundred and fifty of the 22nd Light Dra- goons, two curzicle 6-pounders, and two 5i-inch howit- zers. The Belfast cavalry were under Colonel Durham. The other commanders were Colonel Clavering and Colonel Lumley. Major Seddon commanded the garrison, and, from the reports which hourly reached him, he felt anything but satisfied with his position. Cheer after cheer resounded on all sides, as Cormace Rogan gathered his men and put them into order. Those who had been placed on guard over Mackenzie, found it hard to restrain themselves, now that they saw their comrades under arms. They accordingly sent word to Cormac to be released from that sort of duty. Cormac, while admiring their ardor, impressed upon them the necessity of strict adhe- rence to their duty. "Bib-bib burn th-th-the rascals," shouted Mike Glin- ty, and the words were echoed from mouth to mouth. "No quarter to the Orangemen and yeosj" was repeat- ed on all sides. t Cormac at once communicated with Col. Orr. The latter had not been made acquainted with the detention of Mackenzie, and not knowing exactly how matters stood, ordered his release. Cormac told him of McCracken's orders. "I am here in full command," sternly repeated Col. Orr," and I must be obeyed in every particular." Cormac assented most unwillingly; but, in order to show to those around him, the necessity of prompt ' obedience, did not urge the case further. Small as was this incident, its results were fatal. Col. Orr had wasted time which was all-precious, and what was worse, his mistaken notions of humanity actually   174   nTHE IRISH WIDOW'S SON;    OR, aroused a feeling of bitterness toward himself personally. The men over whom he was placed had suffered and bled in consequence of Mackenziels treatment of them and theirs. These people looked on their Colonel's in- terference as partaking of pity and sympathy with their enemies, and consequently many of them refused to fight under such a commander. Matters were brought to a climax by the report that Mackenzie and his men had escaped! It required no small nerve on the part of Cormac and his friends, to restrain their indignation on receipt of this intelligence. It was not that he cared so much for the fate of the villain Mackenzie, but he dreaded the effect of anything having a tendency to dishearten his men. He soon assumed a cheerful appearance, and endeav- ored, for the moment, to forget what had transpired. By orders of Major Seddon, the drums beat to arms, and the loyal inhabitants of Antrim were called out to join the King's forces and save the town. There were about four hundred capable of bearing arms; but when the moment of danger arrived, not more than half of them were forthcoming at the time. Antrim town consists chiefly of one main street, about a mile and a half long. It is, in fact, but a con-  tinuation of the Belfast road, leading on to Randals- town. At the end of the town is Massareene Castle, with a massive gate, in a wall about sixteen feet high, to- wards the street, and four feet high in the inside, thus forming an excellent breastwork. There is another high wall near to the gate, command- ing Bow Lane, where a body of the insurgents were to enter the town. Half-way up the main street, to the light, is a church standing on a piece of elevated ground. These positions, remarkable for their strength, were all occupied by the British troops, and especially- by the artillery and cavalry.   TlIEk PT!EMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     175 The British commanders had thus secured the strong- est and best posts in which to meet the attack of the in- surgents. The latter were full of heart and in excellent spirits. Orr's column of men-thanks to Cormac Rogan, Pat Dolan, and their brave, dauntless comrades--gave all the appearance of good training. They' were quite of a military stamp. Even those only armed with the pike presented a soldierly appearance, and elicited from all who saw them the highest meed of praise. The colors presented by Kate and Brigid were intrusted to young Phil Dolan, and right gallantly did the standard-bearer fulfil his duty. As the men marched along, and as cheer after cheer arose as new squads joined, Cormac's heart was elated with joy; and often did he wish that Kate was near to see how proudly waved the " gloriousgreen" in front of his gallant men. Had he but known it, his wishes were realized. Un- der the care of Mrs. McQuillan and X[cLeesh, both Kate and Brigid were enabled to take v";a long, sad, lingering look" at that band of Irish loyal hearts, marching forth to meet the enemy of their race. Kate O'Neill's face was flushed and pale, alternately. She easily distinguished Cormac, in consequence of his position, and for a few minutes her heart was like to break. A thousand feelings rushed through her mind at once. At one moment, she beheld him shot dead on the battle-field, surrounded by enemies who gave no quarter; again, her imagination pictured him leading on his men, and then fancied she heard the loud and ringing cheer of victory as Cormac performed some feat of personal daring in the presence of his men. She was really sick at heart'as the cruel thought passed her mind, that probably she had gazed for the last time on one who had won from her the declaration of her heart's young love.   176'   THG'  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, Brigid failed to obtain even one glance at John. Nevertheless, she endeavored to keep up a cheerful ap- pearance, and to assist Kate in doing so likewise. Her heart was none the less sorrowful, but she was better able to endure than Kate. "Well, may God bless the poor fellows, and grant them a safe return," said Mrs. McQuillan. "Amen!" replied her companions; " and, as for those who fall, may the Mother of Heaven be beside them, and comfort them in the moment of their agony." "-It is hard, hard, when one thinks of it," said Kate, in a mournful tone, " that so many of our nearest and dear- est should be required to imperil their lives, in order to obtain as much freedom for their country as enables them to live in it, and to worship God after the fashion of their fathers before them." Not a -bit of it, Kate," asserted Brigid, half laughing- ly, and anxious to keep the brighter side of the picture present to her comrade's mind. "There is nothing hard about it. It is just what every man, and every nation of men should do, either when their liberties are curtailed, or, when they are lost to them altogether." Brigid then referred to the conversation she and ]Kate had together, during the pleasant hours when they sat working at the flag for Cormac's corps. By such gentle means did this true-hearted girl en- deavor to lighten the sorrow of others, while she herself felt no less keenly the sorrow of parting from her lover. / ,    \   THE PFTfEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     1" CHAPTER x I V. THE BATTLE OF AWTRIM --GAT TAWNT FIGHT OF THE, IRISH. "Brothers, if this day should set, Another yet must crown our freedom,- That will come with roll of drum, And trampling files of men to lead them." AccoRDING to McCracken's orders, the insurgents en- tered Antrim at the time and places mentioned. The difficulty which Colonel Orr experienced with the men placed under his command, in consequence of his conduct in the case of Mackenzie, was no slight obstacle to success. That officer did not know his men sufficient- ly, and many of them believing that a thorough exter- mination of the Orangemen and Yeomen was part of the general plan in the " rising," scrupled not to leave their ranks, expressing themselves as being deceived at Cor- mac Rogan not being placed first in command. Although Cormac had dispossessed himself of every feeling on the matter, both John Mullan and Pat Dolan were of the opinion held by many of the men. Their devotion to the cause in which they were embarked, and their personal devotion to Cormac, made them act as he did. As the insurgents entered the town, the soldiers dis- covered some fire-arms concealed in the thatch of a house. They at once set the house in flames; and this being seen by a large number of Orr's men, the latter in- terpreted what they witnessed to mean the triumph of 12   178   T1RE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, the royal forces, who, they believed, were setting fire to the town. Many desertions took place in consequence. Cormac was not slow to perceive how critical the situation was becoming, and immediately applied to Orr to join the' forces of insurgents which he observed hastening into Antrim. Orr at once consented; and Cormac, turning to those he led, informed them of the consequences likely to fol- low on any delay. "As many as wish to follow me," he said, grasping the dolors from Phil Dolan's hand, "this is their way;" and he pointed to a route across a field by which they could join their brethren in arms. A cheer, sudden and sharp, like the fire of musketry, was the answer he received, and pike and musket were flourished in the air, as-over two hundred and fifty of his own brave fellows dashed on to the point he indicat- ed. That cheer was taken up by their comrades whom they joined, and many a loyal British heart quailed as it reach- ed their ears. The first division of the "rebels"' was now engaged with the enemy. McCracken gallantly led them on. They advanced to meet their foes in close columns of twenty. About 800 musketeers were appointed to the front. These were the best marksmen, and contained every man in Cormac's corps who bore a musket. McCracken readily recognized Cormac and his friends, and looked his welcome. It was all he could then do. Whenever the insurgents came in sight of the British forces, they commenced firing in steady order, and con- tinued till within a hundred yards of the army. The British troops met this onslaught by a steadily increas- ing fire. Some disorder appeared in their ranks as they heard the cheering, and saw Cormac's party rush for-   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.        179 ward to join the insurgents' attacking column. Having approached the troops so closely, it was evidently AIc- Cracken's intention to dislodge them from their position in the churchyard. During the fighting necessary for the attainment of this object, the insurgents fought like lions. They were exposed for more than an hour to the deadly effects of the cannon used so mercilessly on their ranks by the soldiers. Cormac beheld some of the bravest of his followers fall dead at his feet. At one time, a rush was made by troops under Col. Lumley, to prevent the occupation of the churchyard. Cormac observed this, and instantly made a wheel with about fifty of his men. He led them on to a sharp engagement. In the thick of the fight he was completely surrounded by the troops, and the en- counter became sanguinary. Hand-to-hand the men on both sides were engaged, and Cormac Rogan felt a fierce. ness within him he never experienced before. A dragoon made a slash at him  with his drawn-sword. Cormac narrowly escaped the blow, which had been aimed at his shoulder. His men got partly divided and confused, as the troops with which he was engaged were reinforced. Phil Dolan kept near to Cormac, and wherever the flag of green waved, there the bloodiest conflict'ensued. One of the field-pieces was ordered immediately to be brought forward. At the first discharge f -grape: shot, three yeomen-one of them  belonging to Mackenzie's body--two artillerymen and five dragoons were left dead on the spot. On its second discharge, the piece was dis- abled by its own recoil. Nothing daunted, Cormac's no- ble followers pressed onward to the goal, encountering a vigorous resistance from the artillery, who kept up a constant and well-directed fire. A shot from a musket, aimed either at Phil Dolan, or at the colors he bore, smashed the flag-staff, and the brave fellow -fell. His father was the first to observe what happened, and   180   'iH:' IRISH WIDOWS  SON; OR, sprang forward. In his way to reach his son, he aimed a deadly thrust at the musketeer with a pike, and liter- ally transfixed him. In one moment more, Phil had sprung to his feet, amid a loud and deafening hurrah. The gallant young fellow caught a sword from a wounded soldier, and, with the flag in one hand and the sword in the other, sprang for- ward toward the churchyard wall. A rush was made, and the British troops reeled, fell back, and vacated their position! The advantage thus gained was immense, and com- pelled the royal troops to withdraw their cannon from that point. No wonder that Maxwell, an English authority, was forced to exclaim: "That the rebels fought with great determination at the battle of Antrim, is not to be denied." As the enemy evacuated that portion of the town, they concentrated themselves in the lower part; for the sec- ond division, under McCracken, had now entered by Bow Lane, bringing with them their remaining cannon, with which they opened fire on the infantry stationed at the castle gate. Here Lumley charged the pikemen at the head of his cavalry. Pat Dolan had about fifty men under his command, and the resistance this body offered to the General was severe and obstinate. His object was to cover the re- treat of the cannon, from the churchyard to the castle gate. About eighty dragoons took part in this action, by galloping furiously against the pikemen. They were also exposed to a fusilade from behind the walls of the churchyard, occupied by the rebels. They broke the rebel column, but the rebels soon formed again, and left seventeen of them dead upon the street, and about forty wounded. Fifty horses were killed, although *- {i   THtE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      181 the action only lasted a few minutes; some say two, others three. The very flower of the English engaged in this fight, The officers who made the charge with Colonel Lumley, were Major Seddon, Capt. Baker, Cornet Dunne, Cornet Reid, and a Mr. Gamble, a friend of Mackenzie's, who be- longed to the yeomanry. Dunne and Gamble were killed on the spot; the for- mer shot through the heart, and the latter perforated with pikes, his horse being shot under him. Quarter- master Simpson was likewise killed in this bloody en- counter. Col. Lumley and Major Seddon were wounded. Both cavalry and yeomanry retreated; the latter tak- ing possession of Lord Massareene's gate. Lord O'Neill and a clergyman had remained at the gate during the whole of this terrific struggle. Pat Dolan was badly wounded by a shot in the left arm. Although the blood streamed down his clothes, he heeded nothing but the work in which he was engag- ed. It was the action of the pikemen, and Dolan thought nothing of his own safety. On he went, directing and encouraging his men. A second shot in the wounded arm brought him to the ground. Not one of his com- panions were near to him at the moment, and brave Pat had almost to crawl into a place of safety. He was soon recognized, and received assistance from two of his men. He was weak from the loss of blood, yet he showed his 'anxiety for those who had beaten back the British troops, by his earnest and oft-repeated inquiries concerning how the battle stood. The King's forces were now concentrated in the lower part of the town, protected by the town hall, and by the houses on either side of the street. The street is large enough for the action of cavalry, and the artillery could sweep it from end to end. These positions offered a means of security to the sol-   182   THal IRI SH WIDOW'S SON; OR, diers, and almost defied any power to take them. Nev- ertheless, McCracken determined to make the trial. He made it, and succeeded! The insurgents were again and again repulsed, whole lanes being made in their ranks. In one of these terrific hail-storms from British can- non, the gallant Phil Dolan fell, pierced in four different parts of the body. The spot on which he fell was frightfully exposed to fire, yet John Mullan sprang into the middle of the storm and caught the riddled flag. With the greatest difficulty he loosened the-death-grasp of the dauntless young Irish hero, who grasped it with the gripe of death. As the insurgents advanced up to the very muzzles of the enemy's guns, Col. Lumley, who was badly wound- ed, seeing the loss he had sustained in his charge against the valorous pikemen, ordered a retreat, and the guns to be abandoned. In the retreat, many of the yeomanry were detached from their comrades, and, as they scampered into places of safety, a rush was made by a man from the rebel ranks, right into their midst. It was poor Mike Glinty, who had discovered Macken- zie. With a yell like an Indian, he made a desperate thrust with a pike at the yeomanry Captain. Mackenzie was quick enough to see that the aim was made at him, and, with a well-parried blow, struck the pike from Glinty's hand. Mike sprang on his opponent, and hurled him to the ground. Both tumbled and wrestled for a minute, when a shot, delivered with un- erring aim, reached Mackenzie's head.

When shot, he literally bounded in the air and fell dead, without uttering a groan. Not so Mackenzie; death was not half so kind to him as to the poor natural. He lay deserted, writhing and moan- ing in intense pain, calling on some one to put an end to his existence; but no one heard him. After two hours' intolerable suffering, he lay an undistinguished corpse on the bloody street of Antrim. The soldiers continued their retreat, and half an hour afterwards McCracken was master of the town! The clergyman who remained with Lord O'Neill, urged that nobleman to leave; but the latter, not taking his advice, was killed by a thrust from a pike. The clergyman, in company with Mr. Staples, another captain of yeomanry, and member for the county, got into a boat, rowed across Lough Neagh to the county Tyrone, and informed General Knox, at Dungannon, that : Antrim was lost to the King. After minutely relating to him the events that had taken place, the General assem- bled 1500 yeomanry, and prevented the rebels of the county Derry from joining with the successful insur- gents of Antrim. Those of the insurgents whom Orr held together, were taken to Randalstown, but nothing was likely to happen there just then, and the men separated. Now occurred one of those mysterious and unfortunate turns of war that appear to be irreconcilable with the success of insurgents. The rebels at Antrim were about being joined by others of their cause, according to the instructions of their Commander-in-Chief; but, seeing the cavalry in hot re- treat from the pikemen of Pat Dolan and the musketeers of Cormac Rogan, they mistook the RETREAT for an at- tack, and became panic-stricken,   184   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR,  The news of this ignominious disaster -was speedily brought into Antrim, and demoralized the rebels in the very hour of their triumph. McCracken, aided by the faithful Cormac, did all that man could do, but in vain. With madness burning in his brain, he seized a pike, and, placing himself in front of his men, menaced with death the first man who even dared to flinch from his colors. Terror, however, had taken possession of the men, and they actually bore down in the confusion of their re- treat the very men who, but an hour before, had proudly led them to victory. They were met by a body of cav- alry, and cut down without leave or grace. Only one hundred and fifty of their number were left dead on the field of battle, while nearly double that number were cut down by the cavalry. Thus ended the Battle of Antrim, one of the noblest episodes in Irish history, accompanied by an inglorious termination. No wonder the brave heart of Cormac Rogan was de- pressed. Now that he had time to reflect, and thought of Dolan's wound, the death of darling Phil, and the unlooked-for end of poor Mike, would that Cormac could have wept. John Mullan approached him, and the two young men fell into each other's arms.   TLEP PI K EMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.    185 CtTAPTER   xV. BATTLE OF BATTNAHTAINICHa-CORMACS DANGER, AND HOW HE EVADES IT - ANOTOJHEI M-ISTAKE. "The danger is come, and the fortune of war Inclines to the side of oppression once more; The people are brave-but they fall; and the star Of their destiny sets in the darkness of yore." DISTrMARMA:TD, and almost broken-hearted, McCrack- en called a council of war. From the reports which had reached him, it was evident that the unanimity of action he had promised to himself as a means to succeed against the English forces, was broken and disturbed, not through want of faith or pluck on the part of the men, but through the blunders almost necessarily and inevitably occurring among the leaders, in consequence of their plans being made known. McCracken was strongly advised to betake himself to a place of safety. He had nothing now left to him but to make his escape as speedily as possible. Accordingly, for that purpose, he requested John Mul- lan and Cormac Rogan to accompany him. Cormac wished to be excused, as he had to see after Pat Dolan, and Mullan was anxious not to be separated from Cor- mac. In the middle of the deliberations, word was con- veyed to those assembled that the insurgents in Ballina- hinch had risen, and -were then actually engaged in mor- tal combat with the English. "That finishes our deliberations," said McCracken. "We must hasten every man of us to the assistance of our countrymen."   t86   THE -IRISH WIDOW'S SON;. OR, Scarcely had the words escaped his lips, when a body of English soldiers were seen approaching. Cormac grasped McCracken by the hand. "Let us separate," he said. "God be with you; take care of yourself," apd Cormac at once departed. John Mullan also grasped McCracken kindly by the hand, and, with the tears streaming from his eyes, urged upon him the necessity of concealment. McCracken cordially returned the friendly grasp of Mullan, and the latter followed Cormac. "To Sleamish," repeated one of McCracken's men. McCracken consented, and the party separated. Cormac being overtaken by John, after a short consul- tation, both agreed to proceed to Ballinahinch. They did so, and on their arrival in that town learned, from a trustworthy source, that Pat Dolan had- been taken into the house of a friend, and that everything conducive to his comfort and recovery had been attend- ed to, Peter Mullan and Ned Dolan were in attendance and admi-nistering to his comfort. As John and Cormac proceeded on their way, they fell in with a number of people preparing to go to Saintfield, where the insurgents, it was alleged, were en- gaged in conflict with the British troops. This report turned out subsequently to be correct; but Cormac and John continued their route toward Ballinahinch, as they had learned that another stand would be made there to retrieve the losses sustained in the flight at Antrim. -Cormac speedily made himself known to General Mun- roe, and introduced John Mullan as his companion and friend. Munroe made known to Cormac that he had encamped, the night before, on Creevy Robks, at Saintfield; but hearing of the disasters that followed the victory at An- trim, determined on securing Ballinahinch as a basis of   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      187 operations. He had'already learned how Cormac had distinguished himself, and wished to appoint him to a command. Cormac resolutely refused. His own men were dispersed, and he would accept of no post save that of a soldier of Ireland. Munroe had taken up a good position on a place known as the Windmill Hill. A portion of his forces had been left at Creevy Rocks to intercept the English soldiers. Learning that Generals Nugent and Barber were on their march to attack him, he posted some of his best musketeers in ambuscade behind the fences which skirted the Windmill Hill, and assigned that post to the command of McCance, an officer in the rebel army, and a man of determination of character and undoubted courage. Both Cormac and John joined the musketeers, as they were likely to be the first engaged in action. The main body of Munroe's men were drawn up on Ethnavaddy Heights, in a south-westerly direction, about a quarter of a mile from the town. The selection of these places bespoke the exercise of particular skill and caution on the part of Munroe. The approach of the English forces was presently an- nounced by a blaze, which kept constantly extending. They had fired the country in alldirections as they passed along: a favorite piece of warfare with English forces, at all times when engaged with a power weaker than them- selves, and especially when in the enemy's country. Nugent evaded the ambuscade, seeing which, both Cormac and John sprang out into the road, and nar- rowly escaped a shell, fired from the artillery under Barber. Two English officers, beholding Cormac and John thus partially separated from their companions (they were endeavoring to join the rebels on Ethnavaddy), rode forward at a gallop. Cormac instantly wheeled   188   THE IRISHE  WIDOW'S SON; OR, about, and, as the foremost approached, took deliberate aim and fired. Horse and rider came both to the ground; the shot had taken effect in the breast of the horse. The second turned to escape, but the unerring bullet of Mul- lan's musket reached him, and left him a corpse on the roadside. Having joined the main body, Munroe entrusted Cor- mac with a message to McCance on the Windmill Hill, ordering him to retire from that position. McCance- refused to obey; and, shortly afterward, lNu- gent, having been reinforced by additional troops from Downpatrick, formed between the hill and the town, and directed a fire on both sides. McCance and Munroe answered bravely, and the men under both commanders fought with a wicked determin- ation to win. Parties of pikeme'n sallied forth in compact masses to besiege the cannon of Barber. An English authority, speaking of these attacks and repulses, says: "The rebels were so furious in their charge as to lay their hands on the carriages of the bat- talion guns, and some of them were almost burnt to a coal by the explosion." Again was Cormac despatched on the same mission to McCance; the latter still refused.*  * It ,does not pertain to the duty either of the impartial his- torian or the author of a work like this, to pass opinions on those Irish generals; but as the persistency of McCance, who did not consent to retire till the third order was given, migllht partake of the character of obdurate blindness and disobe- dience, I consider it right to state that, having often visited the Windmill Hill, where McCance was stationed, I was al- ways firmly convinced of the advantage, in a strategic point of view, which that place held over Ethnavaddy. The author, has often visited these battle-grounds, and, after an impartial in- vestigation into all the circumstances, believes that, had Mc- Cance been strengthened, instead of being ordered to retire, the history of '98 would have been differently fashioned fromr what it is at present.-   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      189 McCance persisted in his refusal, and yielded reluctant- ly, and with visible agitation, at the third order. Toward nightfall, the British troops engaged in the most frightful excesses. They became beastly intoxi- cated, and, in their fury, spared neither sex nor age. They gave themselves up to pillage and murder, and indulged in these propensities of theirs till an advanced hour in the morning.    . Munroe had thus placed within his reach, one of the grandest opportunities ever offered to a commander of '98 in Ireland. He and his men both saw the ravages of fire and sword committed on the weak, the poor, and defenceless; and yet, that General refused the advan- tages of a night-attack on the despoilers of his coun- try. Cormac joined his entreaties with those of the leading men, to induce Munroe to give the word, but all in vain. The whole British force lay at his mercy; yet the gen- tle-minded Munroe would not move a step to secure the victory thus placed by fate at his very feet. A false no- tion-of gallantry was the cause of this mistake. "We scorn to avail ourselves of the ungenerous ad- vantage which night affords," exclaimed Munroe. "We will meet them in the blush of open day; we will fight them like men,-not under the cloud of night, but the first rays of to-morrow's sun." $, A loud murmur was heard among all at this expression of his determination. Word was soon conveyed among the entire body of men under his command, and fretful imprecations were heard on all sides. In vain did Cor- mac and John urge upon those near to them the neces- sity of silence and obedience. Cormac had already won for himself the good opinion of his comrades; but all his efforts, and the efforts of those in command, were unavailing. Over seven hun- a: dred of' Munroe's men left the field. These were nearly   190   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, all armed with muskets, and the-loss was consequently greater. Those who remained were nothing daunted. Like a brave fellow who was hanged on Windmill Hill, who exclaimed that he came there to die, and it mattered little what spot was chosen, they were determined to fight against any odds, and bravely they adhered to that determination. In the morning, Munroe commenced the attack by a discharge from eight pieces of cannon, which was promptly replied to by the heavy artillery of the enemy. Munroe and his forces were filled with enthusiasm, and, giving the order for a general attack, the men rushed forward and bore down all opposition. In the midst of a destructive fire from musketry and cannon, and in the middle of a storm of grape-shot, sharply poured into their ranks, pikemen and musketeers advanced onward and onward, till they were compelled to fight at the very mouths of the British cannon. Cormac grasped the sword of an English Captain, who lay wounded on the field, and fighting his way forward, added to the general enthusiasm of the moment by word and deed. John was by his side, armed with a pike, and gallantly urged on all around him, to remember the fate of Orr. "Remember Orr!!" was shouted from every mouth, and the inspiriting words flashed like an electric spark through the ranks of the "rebels."- After an arduous and almost superhuman struggle, Munroe gained the centre of the town; and, although exposed to a cross-fire in the market-square, he charged with such irresistible impetuosity, that the rebels were victorious, and the British sounded a retreat. It is hard to write it, and harder still for brave Irish hearts to read it -that bugle-note of victory was the death-knell of Ireland's hopes for another century. The rebels, unacquainted with the trumpet's notes,   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     19': and being enveloped in the smoke, and surrounded by all the carnage of war, mistook the order for retreat to one of attack; and, believing thatthe English were about to be, or had been re-inforced, fled in great-haste by the southerly direction of the town, while the British forces, with coward haste, were leaving by the northern outlet. A body of the 22d Light Dragoons attacked the flying rebels, and the English infantry, recovering from their panic, joined in the massacre.  Cormac and John Mullan, instantly perceiving how matters stood, rallied a small number of their comrades four times, but only to be overborne by the pressure of the enemy. Mullan had received a sharp wound in the shoulder, but heeded it not. Munroe galloped up to Cormac, and, pointing to a horse whose rider had been shot, motioned him to fly. Cormac heeded not the safety of himself. He saw those around him stagger from weakness, and did all in his power to further their progress. Munroe was evidently making for Ethnavaddy, in or- der to rally his men. Some of them congregated there, but the hill was speedily surrounded by Royal troops, and out of seven hundred men, Munroe retreated with less than two hundred. Many of course had left in con- sequence of his unwillingness to make the night attack, So terminated the battle of Ballinahinch, long after- wards the seat of Orangeism, and intolerance to the Irish cause. Carnage!  It was the fight for a nation's freedom! Long live the memories of those who fell in ninety-eight,   192  'THE  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, CHAPTER XXVi.

"OOKINGF back at that period when the people of Ire- land, after the loss of their leaders, were forced into premature rebellion, some will be found thoughtless enough to pass their puny and adverse criticism on those who permitted their impatience to urge them into the field. It is easy to judge at this date, with our increased knowledge, and the spread of science and improvement in the art and articles of war, and to pronounce how such and such an undertaking might have been successful, if this plan, and that other sort of action, had been adopted. Let us keep our criticism to ourselves. The present generation of Irishmen are probably the safest judge of what their brethren performed in NIIETY-EIGHT. Better, a thousand times over, to see a gallant fight, and to create the necessity of such with the oppressors of our country, than tamely to lie down at the backs of ditches, and die the death of hunger. Millions of our race have so perished; and, when death on their owr soil is to be their lot, a stand-up fight on the field of battle, encouraged and sustained by the conscious patri- otism that we are performing our duty to our country, is preferable to death by starvation, in the presence of   T'HE PTIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     193 the fruits of the land being carried off to feed the stran- ger. In the confusion .that followed the dispersion of the rebels, John AMullan got separated from Cormac, the latter not knowing whether his faithful companion was wounded, killed, or saved. He suffered in consequence a perfect agony of mind. To return to Pat Dolan's was an adventure he dared not to undertake just then. Ac- cordingly, he bent his steps in the direction of Sleamish, in hopes to join McCracken. It added little to his comfort to behold the ruin and desolation he witnessed on every side. The town he had just left was reduced to ashes its inhabitants, about two thousand in number, were spread over the country, afraid offalling into the hands of the enraged soldiery. The majority of those who had taken part in the struggle, were either dead or wounded, wandering or concealed, from their bitter enemies-the yeomanry. Cormac knew  the danger he incurred by travelling during the day, and had therefore to conceal himself as much as possible, and travel chiefly at night. The slow- ness of his progress disheartened him very much, and the fatigue he had undergone rendered him truly miser- able.  Lying behind haystacks, sleeping for a few hours at a time in some deserted outhouse, and living on the chance bits and sups afforded. him by some one pitying his condition, was all poor Colmac could procure to sus- tain his remaining strength. On the third day succeeding the battle of Ballinahinch, he found himself only some seven miles on his stolen march to reach McCracken's place of concealment, and not knowing even if he were there, if he should succeed in finding the place. Tired and footsore, he was proceeding on his way, when he found himself compelled to enter a cottier's 18   394   THE IRISH ,WIDOW'S SON; OR, house, and ask for a drink of water. He had observed it as a rule to select the poorest looking houses, whenever he wished to obtain any refreshment, An aged-looking woman was the sole occupant of the kitchen when he entered. She kindly invited him to be seated, and speedily provided him with a refreshing draught of new mnilk. He drank it greedily, and offered the woman some small payment in return, but which she modestly declined, remarking, that she did not know but her own poor boy was just then seeking some place to rest in, like the stranger. Hardly were the words spoken, when in dashed a young man, about Cormac's own size and age. The moment he appeared, the woman uttered a shout of joy, and fell into his arms. "Alive and safe, my son! Thanks be to God, your preserver, for this blessing " The young man replied not, but eyed Cormac steadily. The latter felt anything but easy, and rose to leave. '"Let me not disturb you, young man," said the wo- man; " my son has-been absent for the last few days, and I'm thankful at his return." "Remain a little," said the young man, "and have something to eat." Cormac was easily induced to remain, and/so resumed his seat. Cormac fancied he had seen his new companion some- where during the fight in Ballinahinch, but was afraid to ask him. Not so the other, who thought he recognized' in Cor- mac one of the leaders. He instantly inquired if his surmises were correct.        . Cormac acknowledged he had been so engaged, and instantly the young man held out his hand, which the other kindly grasped in return. The mother of the young fellow was rejoiced beyond *^*          TIlE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.    195 measure at this mutual recognition, and kept repeating a string of prayers and praise while she hurriedly pre- pared the humble meal. Every little incident or sound was magnified into ap- proaching danger, and when the quick ear of Cormao heard the sound of approaching footsteps, he went to- wards the door to have a look out. The old woman intercepted him, saying she herself would occasion no notice. She returned in a moment, intimating that it was two men just then passing. As they did so, Cormac stationed himself at a spot where he could see them. The color came and went in his face as he beheld Fleming accompanied with another man. For a moment or two he could not speak. The young man was the first to break the silence, and inquired if Cormac knew either of the strangers? "Yes!" replied Cormac, "one of them is Fleming, a deadly enemy." "What!" exclaimed the other, "Fleming of the estates?" "The same," answered Cormac; and the young fellow sprang to the door, but his mother had caught him by the arm. "Barney," she said, "remember your promise to your dying father!" "Oh, that I had never, made it!" groaned forth the young man, while his whole frame shook with excitement. He turned towards Cormac, and begged to be excused. "But," he exclaimed, "if you knew the villainy of that unhanged dog, you would pity me for not being able to take his life." "I know him well, too well," said Cormac; " but there is a hand will overtake him yet;" were he but on the field of battle I would have sought him out at the risk of a thousand lives, and given him the rich reward of his life. But to-day-"   196   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "I understand you well," said the poor woman; "but an attack upon him now would be nothing short of mur- der." She then informed Cormac, that by the intrigues of Fleming, she, and her husband and son, were dispos- sessed of their comfortable little holding. Her husband never rallied after his change, and died soon after. "Did you ever hear of a family named Dorrian?" in- quired Cormac. "What! the Dorrians! whose place was given to one 'Cameron?" said the woman. "The same," answered Cormac. "Why, they were friends of our own," she exclaimed- "The hand of Providence overtook that man Camer- on," said Cormac; and he rehearsed to the astonished mother and son, the history of Cameron's death. Noth- ing could exceed the astonishment of his hearers as Cor- mac described the burning of his mother's dwelling, her death, and the miraculous escape of Brigid O'Hara. Shortly afterwards, the old woman prevailed on Cor- mac to occupy her son's bed. The young man also in- sisted, as Cormac was so tired, and meantime, having learned Cormac's intention of proceeding in search of McCracken, acknowledged his readiness to start at once on that business, assuring Cormac that he would more readily succeed as he knew that part of the'country well. Matters were so arranged, and Cormac retired to par- take of that rest he so urgently stood in need of. 'He slept soundly for several hours, and was at length awakened by the sound of voices at his bedside. The young man had returned, and being commissioned by a person instructed for that purpose, was .obliged to create a noise so as to rouse up Cormac, to inform him of all he had learned.        , Cormac hastily sprang up; he was in the middle of a dream, and had fancied he heard the order to " advance," just given.   'THE PTKE]\IEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.    ]97 He was quickly put in possession of all the informal- tion the young man had learned. McCracken had been pursued, and fled over the moun- tains by himself, Munroe was caught that morning, and confined in jail. Mullan had safely made his way to Pat Dolan's, and both were safely concealed in Roddy Flynn's. The yeomen were searching everywhere for Cormac, arid Dolan's advice was that he should at once disguise himself, and haste to their quarters with speed. Cormac eagerly inquired from what source the infor- mation proceeded, and, by the description he received of the man who communicated it, he at once learned it was no other than his old friend, Israel Milliken. He at once saw the position in which he was fixed, but could not find the way how he was to better-it. The good old- woman at once proceeded to plan a dis- guise. The old clothes belonging to her husband at once suggested itself as the only remedy at hand. In these, Cormac was quickly arrayed, and, as the old, bespattered trowsers were drawn on, he could not help smiling at the great change they effected in his appear- ance. The old coat and vest were also speedily put into use, and an old bruised hat completed his attire. He certainly had a changed appearance; and, as with heavy heart he bade his kind hostess adieu, the young fellow announced his intention of accompanying him a part of the way. After repeated blessings and prayers for his safety, he was prepared to, start upon the road, promising that if ever he possessed the power of rewarding his friends for their kindness to him in the hour of his need, he would do so. "Never mention it, my child," said the old woman; 6" sure, if more I could do for you, wouldn't I do it, with a thousand welcomes! May God take care of you and spare you, is my hearty prayer; " and the tears fell fast from her eyes, as she shook his hand warmly at parting. 5-c vP ,-   198   THE IRISH WIDOWS SON; OR, CTTAPTER  XVL.

'tis to repeat Our vows, both night and day, To dear old Ireland-brave old Ireland; Ireland, boys, hurrah!" CORMAc found himself wonderfully refreshed by his short stay in the widow's cabin. Bitter as was the news he had learned, it partly relieved his suspense, and he found that he could travel much better than he had at first expected. Nothing transpired for the first four or five miles on the journey, and Cormac besought the young man who kindly accompanied him, to return, assuring him that now, as he was in a part of the country which he knew pretty well, he could proceed alone. Reluctantly the young man consented. "If I thought," he said, warmly, " that any danger was likely to come across you, I would not think of parting with you; but, as it is, you are probably as safe alone." "I thank you from my heart, my good fellow," said Cormac, in reply, " and have but to repeat the assurance I gave your kind-hearted mother, that I hope one day to be able to repay your kindness." "Not another word, Captain," replied the young man, taking Cormac by the hand. "I only wish that every man who grasped a gun or, pike in behalf of his coua- fry's cause, was half as good a man as you." th a   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       199 Cormac returned the compliment, and they separated. As he trudged along, sometimes briskly, and some- times in a halting manner, when he met any one on the road, Cormac could not help surveying himself, and giv- ing a melancholy smile, as the thought crossed his mind of the manner in which Kate would receive him if she saw him in his disguise. About an hour -after he had parted with his friend, a countryman, riding in a cart, overtook him, and kindly invited the " old man" to take a seat beside him. Cormac excused himself on the ground that he would not be able to climb into the cart. '"We can soon arrange that for you," said the country- man. "Sure, I can help you in, poor old fellow; " saying which, he dismounted, and assisted Cormac into the ve- hicle. The pair drove on together for a considerable distance, without exchanging many words. Cormac's companion showed some anxiety to engage in conversation, but he himself, troubled as he was with a constantly recurring cough, such as any old man might not feel ashamed of, betrayed no such anxiety. In fact, he made it appear that the jolting of the cart, and the stress of coughing, were as much as he could reasonably be expected to en- dure. "These are rather nasty sort of times," said the driver. "'Yes," replied Cormac; "'things are a good deal dull, but the want of rain is chiefly the cause. The hay crop in particular -" "Oh! I don't mean that at all. I mean the country is a good deal disturbed of late." "Ugh--I know-to be sure-to be sure," groaned the old man, following up his not very interesting reply by a series of hard, dry coughs. 'Do you belong'to these parts?" inquired Cormac's companion, with a dry sort of leer.   200   THllt  IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "Aye, aye; to be sure. All parts are alike to the poor. God help them." "There's no call for people to be poor here, were it not for the d-d rascally rebels, who won't be at peace." Cormac's cough was evidently getting worse. "Do you see that pair of- trees over there, my old friend?" asked the countryman, pointing toward two stately ash trees in an adjoining field. Cormac looked up, and casting a glanicearound him, said," Where?" as if he had not paid sufficient attention to what was said. "Over there, in the field we are just passing.' "Aye, aye; bonnie fine trees, true enough," remarked Cormac, in a most decidedly careless sort of tone. "Yes, bonnie fine trees you may call them, my good old fellow," replied the driver, giving a crack with his whip. "Them's the trees where I helped two trouble- some customers to their death a day or two ago." "Indeed," remarked Cormac. "Yes, sir," the other continued; " a short rope and a good strong bough, for every rebel, is my motto; and if his majesty's gallant fellows, or our own loyal-hearted yeomanry, who are out scouring the country to-day, can lay hands on one or two more of the blackguards, I wouldn't mind' giving them a helping hand at the same work over again." "Oh, a sad, sad thing to take away life in such a man- ner!" quietly remarked Cormac. "Nothing sad about it. It is the duty of every loyal man, at a time like this, to shrink not from the perform- ance--" "Of acting the hangman," suggested Cormac, antici- pating what the other was about to say. "Yes, my good friend, even to perform the unpleasant duties of that same limb of the law."     - "Bad work, bad work!" continued Cormac, half heed- less. of the other's remarks.   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      201 Just-then a patrol of soldiers came in sight, and Cor- mac half doubled himself up where he was sitting, and became afflicted with a strange wheezing sound in his -throat. He was evidently uneasy, and wished from all his heart that he were a mile or two out of sight of the red- coats just then. As they came forward, the soldiers halted, and the driver pulled up the horse. "Any luck to-day, boys?" was the question asked. "( Och, aye; the deevils ain luck," was the answer, and Cormac recollected the sound of a voice which he had heard before. "Wha'll thae auld gingerly loon be aside ye there?" inquired the same speaker, who evidently was acquainted with the driver. "Oh, only an old man travelling a bit of the road, and as the cart was empty, I gave him a lift on the way." "You should aye act wi' great caution," said Sandy, peering into Cormac's face, rather keenly. "These are nae the sort o' times to show muckle kindness." "True, quite true; but just you catch a chap like me nodding, and I'll give any man of you leave to call me a fool." "Nae doot o't; ye'll no' likely hae a bit o' bladderskin aboot ye," exclaimed Sandy. "Would a whole one not be as good as a bit of one?" said the countryman, stooping down, and poking among some hay in a corner of the cart. A small jar of whiskey was produced from its hiding place, and immediately handed to the soldiers. It was common in those days to employ soldiers as revenue police when not engaged on other duty, and the request about the "bit of a bladderskin," referred to this practice.

After several congratulations, none of which sounded very musical in the ears of Cormac, the soldiers went on their way. Having taken their departure, the companion of Cor- mac offered him a drop of what remained in the jar. Cormac declined, but the other insisted that it would do his cough good. Rather than appear unfriendly, Cormac applied +the jar to his lips, and, in doing so, thought he observed the driver lustily engaged in pulling off his coat; then lift- ing his hat suddenly, and pulling something off his head, instantly replaced the hat. Handing back the jar, he thanked the driver, and, although not caring to gaze too intently into his face, was sure that he observed some kind of a change in the owner of the cart. "Take another drop," said the driver; but the request was politely refused. "Then here's your very good health, Cormac, my boy; and many happy and better days to both of us I "Say- ing which, the driver of the cart took a long pull from the jar. Cormac certainly heard him, but did his ears deceive him? How could he tell? He muttered something like thanks, and bethought himself of jumping out of the cart,and proving how an old man, with a bad cough, could cover a certain amount of ground in a given time. Then those trees to which his companion allud- ed! that allusion was not calculated to compose his nerves. All these thoughts flashed quickly through his mind, only to be dissipated and laughed at, as Israel   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     203 ,Milliken held forth his hand, to be tightly grasped by Cormac, who suddenly found out the true character of his companion. "Gracious heavens! Who would have thought it was you, Milliken?" exclaimed Cormac, suddenly cured of his cough.        - "Or, rather, who in the name of this good day would have thought it was you, Cormac? " "But you see you were the first to recognize me. I need not ask if you knew me when you first saw me." "Certainly, I knew you; but allow me to give you full credit for your disguise. I don't mean the old garments alone, but the character of the old man was well sus- tained. One thing only you forgot: your hair should be unattended to, and your face a little less acquainted with water, considering the means that an old man like you, you know, could be expected to have, roaming over the country." - "And you almost instantly recognized me." "Not instantly. Believe me, my good fellow, I should -never have known you, but for young Barney, who helped to deck you out." "You know him, then?" "Know him, yes; a finer fellow, nor any honester, can't be found in these parts." "He is, indeed, a kind, brave-hearted fellow." "But the soldiers, Cormac? You forget what danger we were both on the point of encountering there, my boy."5 "No, far from it. I was just about to ask you if they knew who you are?" "One of them knows.2" "The Scotchman " half shouted Cormac, in amaze- ment. "The very same," answered Milliken; " a good loyal- hearted fellow, who would sell His Most Gracious Majes- ty, and the half o' his dominions, for a yeafs payl"   t x 204   'Tnz IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, Milliken then rehearsed, to Cormac's astonishment, the fact of his being out for the past week, in company with some others, on the search for McCracken. Dur- ing one of their patrols, they fell in with Sandy and a companion. After some conversation, a proposal was made, which both soldiers swore to abide by; it was that they should render all the assistance in. their power to help in discovering McCracken's whereabouts. One hundred pounds was paid to each of them, and a like sum was to be given them in the event of their being' successful. "But the Government reward is likely, nay, is sure to be larger than that; and should these villains succeed in finding out McCracken's whereabouts, rest assured-they would be the very first to claim the reward and give him up to the government." , "Decidedly so. We know all that," continued Milli- ken; " but our object was to bribe them to give no at- tention to those who were really on the look-out for McCracken. Besides, we had them sworn to fulfil their contract under pain of death." Milliken continued to inform Cormac of many matters with which the latter was unacquainted. He had bor- rowed the horse and cart from a friend, carried a dis- guise about with him, prominent among which was a delightful wig of red, unkempt hair. iHe was about pro- ceeding toward Belfast, when he learned from friend Barney, that Cormac was gone on his way to meet with Mullan and Dolan at Roddy Flynn's. He then and there changed his mind, and turned to overtake him, affirming that had it not been for the information he had received he would never have been able to recognize Cormac. Both had many things to relate to each other, and the time wore on pleasantly enough, without any further ad-. ventures, till they reached the house of Roddy Flynn. Arrived there, Milliken bawled out to bring some water   THE PTKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      205 to his horse. The order was obeyed, slowly enough, by Roddy's wife. As the horse was engaged allaying his thirst, Milliken, who had assumed his disguise, keptup a running banter with Mrs. Flynn. "Any loiterers hereabouts?" he inquired. "'Deed no, sir. It's a poor, lonesome district, and few call this way." ' "That's the very thing induced me to make the inqui- ry," said Milliken. "Yet this is just such a place as ona would select for concealment," he continued, partly ad- dressing Cormac, and the good woman at the same time. "Of course you can make a meal ready for us?" in- quired Cormac. "I don't think it, sir," she replied. "Besides, there is no one in the house but myself; my old man is over -in the field beyond." "Oh, nonsense!" said Milliken; " didn't we hear sever- al voices just as we pulled up?"' ' Certainly," responded Cormac. Mrs. Flynn was no adept at dissimulation, and sharply told the strangers " it was none of their business what they heard;" saying which, she retired into the house. Milliken and Cormac dismounted, laughing heartily as they did so. In a few minutes the disguises were thrown aside, and both Milliken and Cormac were heartily and warmly re- ceived. Pat Dolan and John Mullan had greatly improved. Their injuries were severe enough; Pat's especially. John Mullan was even better than Cormac had dared to hope. They had one and all many things to talk over, but Milliken insisted that he must leave. "Sure you came in to get a meal," said Roddy's good- hearted wife, " and you can't think of going till you get the best the house affords." There was nothing for it but submission, and Milliken postponed his departure till he had partaken of the hos- pitalities of Mrs. Flynn.   206   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, CHAPTER   xvnl.

"O, give uS but one trial more, And count the men on either side; Two to one we'll give you o'er- But let the ground be clear and wide." AFTER wandering about for some weeks, McCracken found that his continued safety depended on the merest chance. By his advice, those of his friends who had stood by him, and were willing to do so till the last moment, had left his company, and he was now alone. Once he received word from a poor old woman, who had con- cealed him for some time, that parties of soldiers were constantly seen about the mountains. Accordingly, he thought fit to leave that part of the country and did so. His determination was, if possible, to reach the sea- shore, and depend on chance for a passage across the channel to France. His funds were at the lowest ebb, and he had no means of communicating with his friends, to get his purse replenished. One day he was, observed by a couple of yeomanry, who evidently knew him, and he had, in consequence, a hard race for his life. At an- other time, on turning into a by-road, in order to allow a number of country people to pass by, he encountered two patrols, and was pursued and fired at. These revers- es disheartened the fugitive, and rendered him nervous and timid. At length, being worn out with constant vig- ilance and want of rest, he entered a house and made his   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      207 case known, depending on the honor of the people in whose hands he placed his life. This was a step gener- ally successful in the case of others, for the people were seldom, if ever, known to betray the trust reposed in them. In the midst of a1 sorts of disasters, the Irish people have ever and alwayS proved their honor and de- votion to whoever was so circumstanced as McCracken. Unfortunately for him, the place which he had entered belonged to an Englishman, who, after receiving from the noble outlaw all he possessed in money and cloth- ing, immediately gave information to the authorities, and the Comnmander-in-Chief of the " rebel " forces of Ulster was taken prisoner. Both Munroe and McCracken were hanged and quar- tered! England has often seen danger in the corpse of an Irish. "rebel," and that may probably account for the inhu- manities perpetrated on the bodies of the dead. 'Talk of mercy! England knows nothing of that term in her treatment of Irishmen, especially when an attempt has been made by the latter to slip the bonds in which they live. It is, probably, a good thing after all, that Irishmen have so many examples of hangings and quarterings kept constantly before their eyes. Such lessons not easily forgotten, and should never be forgiven until the cause which called them forth shall triumph. Then, and not till then, shall Irishmen mix forgiveness and forget- fulness together. Word had been brought to the party at Roddy Flynn's of the execution of both these men. They expected as much some day or another, but still the news fell like a thunderbolt in their midst. They were grieved and sad- *  dened beyond measure. "The blow is heavier than the death of my son," said Pat Dolan.   208'   THiE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, There was no reply to his remark; for, hide it as he might, Dolan felt keenly the loss of his boy, and Ned's heart refused to be comforted since the death of his brother. John Mullan still endeavored to sustain the spirits of all around him. His good nature shone forth stronger, if possible, whenever he observed a tinge of sadness in his fiends. He bantered Cormac on several occasions, by relating lhis fancies as to the future career of Kate O'Neill, whom he prophesied would be the mother of 16ots of rebels." And I'll be godfather to the whole of them," cried out Roddy Flynn. " Justl if it's pleasing to me," said his better half. "Come, Mullan," said Pat, " give us a song, old boy. We weren't beaten after all." "With pleasure," said John; and, after shifting his seat so as to see all the company, he commenced to the tune of Viva La:- "( O, GIVE US BUT ONE TRIAL MORE.

'Deck yourselves in armor bright, Raise your blood-stained flag on high,- And then we'll show you how to fight, Before we show you how to die.

' Whene'er again we bow the knee, It will be at the word-' Prepare! ' To make your riders backward reel, And with our death-shouts rend the air.'" The simple strain produced its natural effect. The minds of one and all reverted to the part each had taken in the battles of their country. "But they'll never give One trial more," said Pat Dolan, addressing the singer. "They haven't given one yet," replied Mullan. "We got a chance, and took it." "And the plan will be, to make our chances surer of success in time to come," said Cormac. A conversation took place as to the best means of in- suring a continuation of the safety of those present.. The Government was losing no opportunity to find out the places of concealment of those who had taken an active part in the rebellion. Cormac and Mullan maintained there was but one course open to them-emigration. Pat's heart was, as he expressed it, in the Old Land, where his gallant son f had fought and fell. "And as for the old woman and myself," said Roddy Flynn, " we shall lay our bones together, if the soldiers quietly permit us." X No word had been obtained from Father McAuley's; and both Cormac and Mullan were anxious and uneasy on that account. It was probable that none of them "   210   Tllt IRIS"WIDOW'S SON; OR, knew whnether their friends outlived the battles in which they were engaged. Cormac suggested that all should endeavor to make their way to the vaults at Shane's Castle, as, in t'hat case, they would be nearer their friends, and their chances of safety secured. Pat Dolan would not listen to this proposal. The chances were that Fleming either had found out the place, or would succeed in so doing. Besides, that part of the country was too close to those places where the English. soldiers were, encamped. Any place in the immediate vicinity of Antrsn or Randalstown was dangerous, es- pecially to those who were known to have been residents in that quarter. Milliken advised that John and Cormac should go with him en route to Belfast. There was danger in the pres- ence of three men together, but there was also some chance of safety in their strength of numbers. He was sure if he had the two young men in the neighborhood of Belffast or C arrickfergus, they might easily escape to Scotland, from which place they could sail for America as soon afterwards as convenient. This plan was looked upon as the most feasible, but Cormac would not listen to it at that time. He openly avowed his motive. He wished to see Miss O'Neill, and to learn that there was no probability of anything hap- pening to her in the event of his departure. It is need- less to say that John Mullan was of the same opinion, and earnestly seconded the views of Cormacq Milliken, shortly afterwards took his leave. He was not certain if he would ever again have the happiness of Tnixing with any of his friends then present.' One thing only he was certain of: as long as he lived he would bear a kindly recollection of them one and all. The parting .with ,Milliiken was enough to try- the nerves of the strongest among that party of refugees.                  .   1H1J PIlU MEN OF NINETY-EIGHRT.      2" He was well beloved by them all, and he, in his turn, had always shown the warmth of his affection for them. True, they differed in religion, but, on the question of their country, they were ONvE in heart and soul. Brave and gallant Milliken! no truer heart than thine ever beat in the breast of an Irishman I Israel Milliken lived to a good old age. Nearly fifty years subsequent to the date of our story, the stately form of lMtilliken might have been seen, as he wended his way through immense crowds to take his post as chair- man at the Repeal meetings held in Belfast. His hair was long, and as white as snow, which gave him quite a patriarchal appearance. The chair used on such occasions was of carved oak. It had seen some duty in '82, having been used at the Volunteer meeting in Dungannon. Israel used to lay his hand upon it, keep gazing at it for a moment or two, then shake his head as much as to say: "You and I, old chair, have seen the time-we two belong to a past age." In his old days he was a man of few words, but always earnest and sincere; and if, as often happened, any speaker alluded to the affair of '98, the spirit of the old man waxed warm, as the memory of those days flashed across his mind, bringing back the active scenes of that troubled period. After Milliken's departure, Pat Dolan advised that Cormac should proceed to Father   McAuley's, and learn some tidings of their friends. Night-time was the safest for travelling, and it was expected that Cormac would reach the place by morning. Cormac readily complied-infact, he inwardly thanked Dolan for the suggestion.  Assuming his disguise once more, he shortly afterward started on the road. ,    .                 .   212   THE  IRISH WIDOQWS SO13; OR, CHAPTER 3XX  COQRMAOS ARRIVAL AT FAT'hEi JOHN'S--HOW HEU WAS RECi VM U. it One blessing on my native Isle- One curse upon her foes! While yet her skies above me smile, Her breeze around me blows." IT was Saturday evening when Cormac undertook his pleasant mission. With a heart lighter than he had known for many a day, he walked on, briskly and buoy- antly, humming snatches of airs to beguile the time. His thoughts often reverted to his dear mother, and he felt a holy consolation in offering up the tribute of a prayer for the repose of her soul. Never before did he realize so fully the state of his orphanhood. Had he succeeded with his companions-in-arms in redeeming his country from English bondage, he felt that her death had been avenged.                   C As it was, he had done all in his power, and if the spir- it of his sainted mother could see his heart, she -would behold nothing there to displease her. One- great point in Cormac's character throughout life, and especially after his mother's death, was to live and act in all things to please her. The sterling principles of practical, but unseen piety, which he had imbibed in early years, became for him ever afterwards a standard by which he ruled and-governed himnself. In this respect, the IRISH WIDOW'S SON was greater than in all others   THE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.       213 put together. And it is in this light he shouldbe judged and his example followed. His true-heartedness as an Irishman arose from his virtues; and observation has at all times proved that where these excel, so, in like man- ner, is the patriotism that springs from such of more genuine and permanent value than that ephemeral sort born of a false enthusiasm. Cormac met with no adventure worth relating on his way to Father McAuley's. He arrived early in the morn- ing, and paid his first visit to Mrs. McQuillan's, whose house stood in the path he was taking. Nothing could exceed the surprise of the good woman, on learning who her visitor was. "Sure, God be praised!" she exclaimed-and she kept wringing and twisting at her fingers-" it was just last Sunday night myself and the whole neighbors were talk- ing about you. Some would have it that you were killed on the first day; others, that you had been taken and flung into jail; but sure it was myself that never gave up heart nor "-and here she whispered into Cormac's ear -" allowed others to do {hat same." Cormac thanked her, and was rejoiced to hear that Fa- ther John, Kate and Brigid were as well as might be ex- pected. He thought proper to take off his disguise, as he wish- ed to be present at -Mass. "You Jtad better hurry, then," she said, " for last Mass is said an hour earlier than usual." Cormac did not require to be twice told. He Was just in time. The little chapel was about half filled. A few minutes after he entered, he cast his eyes over towards the spot usually occupied by Kate, but she was not present. His heart misgave him. Had Mrs. McQuillan informed him correctly. The thought had scarcely passed through his mind, when Kate entered. She looked well, and inwardly he thanked God.   2] 4   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR,   Passing out witlh- the crowd after Mass, Cormac was speedily recognized by a few friends, and right hearty were the greetings he received. He endeavored to con- ceal himself as much as possible, and succeeded. Half an hour afterwards, he was about entering Father John's, and, for that purpose, had to proceed through the chap- el yard. A few old women knelt here and there among the graves, according to custom. Cormac glanced over toward the spot beneath which rested the remains of his mother. To his surprise, he saw Kate O'Neill bent down in prayer beside the grave. He stood for a moment immovable. This, then, had been her practice. He felt it, he knew it. He sighed and passed on. On entering Father John's, the first person he met was Brigid, who uttered a scream of delight. Without ever thinking of proprieties or improprieties, she rushed right into his arms, and-yes, we may as well tell the truth- kissed him.  The next moment she was off in search of Kate; and, before Cormac had time to take a seat, rushed in with her truant. Kate received Cormac less demonstratively, but none the less kindly. Cormac's manner toward her was warm, but reserved. She knew nothing of his intended presence there that day, and when he beheld her at the grave of his mother, the whole current of his feelings became changed. He was attached and devoted to Kate, as the reader knows; but his attachment and devotion increased as they never were before.  Whenever he heard that Cormac Rogan was in the house, Father John shouted out, 1 Where, where, let me see himi " and the aged priest ran about everywhere in his -anxiety to behold his "favorite child,' as he called himJT    TIIE PIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGIT.     215 In his hurry, Father John ran into places where no one would expect to find a stranger. He got partly ir- ritable as he entered the kitchen to make further in- quiry, and there beheld his favorite. What a meeting! The priest could not restrain his tears. For some time past he indulged in hope, then imme- diately thought it impossible that Cormac could have escaped with his life. Many a prayer he had uttered for the young man's safety; but believed that if he had escaped, he was then far removed from that part of the country, and the chances were that he would never see him again. Great, therefore, was his joy, and so unexpected I "Well, God's ways are wonderful!" said Father John., Many were the inquiries concerning John Mullan and Pat Dolan. The excitement grew intense, as those pres- ent learned that they were all safe. News of Phil Dolan's death had reached them, but that was all. Brigid's cheek grew pale and red, alternately, as Cor- mac described the heroic conduct of John during the battle at Ballinahinch. Cormac's eye detected the tell-tale signs, and improved the occasion by sounding Mullan's praise, while he mod- estly kept his own brave conduct in the background. "And what is better," continued Cormac, "he has something to show for his conduct. He bears the no-  blest badge of honor that a soldier ever delighted to wear." "And what is that?" inquired Kate, half guessing the mind of the speaker. ",The scars of wounds received in his country's cause," replied Cormac; who every moment grew more enthusi- astic, as he saw how the words he spoke were relished. c; And our flag?" asked Kate.   216  ' TH[E IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, "Is in John Mullan's possession this moment," said Cormac'; " and I'm afraid that if ever an unpleasant word passes between us, it will be for the ownership of that bit of green." "For shame, Cormac!" cried Kate. "By your own ac- count, he is the most deserving." "I have it," said Brigid. "Two of us were engaged in making it. Give it to me, and I'1 divide the hon- ors." "Never!" urged Kate. "Im sure that Cormac would never condescend to see that little emblem of his coun- try's cause divided." "Right, my girl!" exclaimed her lover; " disunity is not for me. Let us hope that some day it may wave again in the cause of Ireland." Amen!" replied Father John. "Although I will never see it, nor live to hear of it." The patriotic Father John was blithe and merry over the occurrences of the day. Much as he valued the company of Cormac Rogan and his "-other children," as he was pleased to call them, yet he had some " duties to perform," and must retire. He begged Cormac to be watchful, and advised his quick return to Mrs. McQuillan's. Her place was one- of the safest in the whole parish, and she was a shrewd woman besides. Cormac promised obedience, but did not honorably fulfil his promise, at least so far as his immediate depar- ture was concerned. He had a plan or two in his mind, and these he wished to divulge to a certain person. They were not of much consequence,--but we shall probably hear more about them. It is needless to remark that Cormac Rogan- protract- ed his stay at Father McAuley's as long as he could. It was like entering on a new life, and the trials and vicis-   THE PIIKEMEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.      217 situdes he had lately passed through entitled him to whatever relaxation he could obtain. Before he left the place, he had an interview with Fa- ther John. He briefly and manfully opened up his mind to the good clergyman. He made known to him the danger in which he stood. "I know it, my son;" said the priest; S" and my most earnest wish is that you see to your own protection as quickly as possible. "Protection to myself," said Cormac, " is not the only thing I must think about. I intend, with God's help,"' he continued, " to leave the country as soon as I can; and if you have no particular objection to offer, dear Father, I should like to be accompanied by another person." "And leave the poor old priest to live and die alone?" replied Father McAuley. "I know I am selfish; pardon me," said Cormac. "Not selfish, by any means, my dear boy. In fact, I half-suspected this the moment I saw you to-day. I was only in jest, Cormac. I have full faith in your honor and integrity. Go, and consult with poor Kate, and I am willing to be guided by your conclusions. Cormac bent his knee, and humbly requested the old man's blessing; after which he took leave of him till the day following. He requested Kate's company a part of the way.--a re- quest which the good-hearted girl yielded quite readily. "Mind you don't go too far," said Brigid, as shy saw Kate prepare to accompany Cormac. "Only a very short distance," said the latter, "and Brigid will accompany us." Brigid refused, but acknowledged her willingness to await Rate's return, if Cormao promised to return with her. The promise was given, and Mrs. McQuillan hurried on her way to prepare something nice for Cormac,   218   THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON; OR, It was a beautiful July evening; the air odorous with the fragrance of flower and leaf. The sun was awaiting the presence of Cormac and Kate. All around was still and silent. Cormac soon made known to Kate the nature of his interview with Father John. He renewed the pledge of k his unalterable love to the dear sweet girl by his side. Frankly he acknowledged his poverty, but was strong in hope that, under other circumstances, he would be able to offer to the girl he sought, a happy and a pleasant home. Kate listened silently to all she heard. The beating of her heart prevented the use of many words; besides, that heart was too full of the past and the future to per- mit her to indulge in the free expression of all she wish- ed to say. Her true maiden, modesty filled her breast with some sort of grief. She loved Cormac Rogan well and truly, and she knew he was aware of that,-yet she felt troubled and sad. Cormac continued his suit with renewed warmth, and, if possible, with stronger promises of his fealty through life. "I doubt not your love, nor its continuance, Cormac," said Kate; 1" but you ask for too much. I can never con- sent to be your wife, and leave this place at once. Had Providence so ordained it, I would willingly have joined my lot to yours, but for some time to come that cannot be." "You refer to Father John," said Cormac. "I do," was the reply. "He is willing to abide by any arrangement we see fit to make- W  "I know it.

COM-IAC kept his promise to Bricid. He returned with Kate, and showed such a disposition to renew his visit, that Brigid and Kate were necessitated to remind him several times of Mrs. McQuillan's last injunctions, not to remain long behind. He had, therefore, no resource left but to hurry after the good woman, who had prom- ised to have " something nice " for him on his return. Father John had said that 1Mrs. McQuillan was a shrewd woman. All who knew her gave her credit for that character. Cormac found her most valuable as an adviser. He did not attempt to conceal from her that he ran some risk in coming to that part of the country, just then. Next, he informed her of the real nature of his visit, and the success that attended it. "And did you really believe that Kate O'Neill would marry you right off, and start for America?P" inquired Mrs. McQuillan. "I certainly did; but I confess I did not view the mat- ter in the same light as I do now," replied Cormac. "Then you don't know the girl youintend to make your wife," composedly remarked the good womanl. "Kate   220   Tsl IRISH WIDOWSS SON; OR, O'Neill," she continued, "owes a good deal to Father John's care, and she knows that if she left him now, it would shorten the old man's days, and she would never forgive herself afterward." Cormac confessed that he saw it in that light now. "But, I'll tell you, Cormac,' added Mrs. McQuillan, who was delighted at being made a confident in the matter,-" to ease your own mind, my boy, get married, and proceed as soon as you like to America. You will have up-hill work there for some time. Then, when you have a competence earned, send for Kate or return here; but don't ask her to leave her uncle." Cormac promised to consider the matter, and retired. Next morning, Mrs. McQuillan told him that she had a "trifle of money" saved, which she did not then require to use. She offered it to Cormac, and gave her blessing with it. The sum amounted to twenty pounds, and Cor- mac, after thanking her, told her he would repay it the first thing he did. During another interview with Father John, Cormac informed him of his intention to depart as speedily as possible. He had changed his mind, and would post- pone his intended marriage. He had wished, all along, to -have that ceremony performed by the kind old priest who had been his adviser through life, and at whose hands he had received the holy water of baptism. "You have my heartfelt blessing on your projected union, wherever and whenever it takes place," replied the priest; " and I can see the time when your days will pass pleasantly and peaceful," he added. Nothing now remained for him but to take his leave of Kate, and the parting was sorrowful enough on both sides. During the day, Cormac received word that he must not return to Roddy Flynn's. Dolan and Mullan had left, and Cormac was to proceed at once to Carrickfergus.

This intelligence had been communicated by the faith- ful Milliken, who ,also informed Cormac that he had se- cured a passage in the ship for him, under the name of "Patrick Magennis." The last words were spoken between Cormac and Kate in the old chapel yard, standing beside the graves of their parents. A. kind farewell had been bestowed upon Brigid, with the hope that ere long they would all be re- united in a happier land, and Cormac took his departure. There was deep and openly-expressed sorrow in the old priest's ho use that day; but when the inmates learned that Government police were hunting up and down through the country for these men, they felt satisfied that one, at least, was likely to elude the clutches of his enemies.   S: Three days afterwards, Cormac was on the Atlantic. He had not the privilege of bidding farewell to his friends, whom he had hoped to see before his departure. CONCLUSION. TPrREE years had elapsed from the time when Cormac sailed for the Land of the West. Often and again, dur- ing that long perio d,he suffered in mind and body. Twice only did he receive a letter from Kate O'Neill, while he had written more 1han a dozen of times. He had remit- ted the money lent him by Mrs. McQuillan, together with, a handsome present; the latter she retained for the sake of the giver, but tLe money she privately bestowed upon Kate O'Neill. Matters had quieted down in the North of Ireland, and, after long and tedious wanderings, Pat Dolan had re-   222   'THE IRISH WIDOW'S SON;   ,OE turned to his own place. At first he felt rather insecure; but if danger appeared, he went out of the way for awhile till it passed over. Strange as it may appear, the first wedding among our friends was that which followed the nuptials of Pe- ter Mullan and Peggy Dolan. Peter had proved himself an honest man in the absence of the master of the place, and when offered payment by Pat Dolan, gallantly in- formed the latter that he thought he was entitled to his own terms, Pat's wife was of the same opinion,--hence the changed, condition of Peter's life, and the happiness of Peggy Dolan. "Mrs. Mullan, will you please to close that door, and let us all sit around the stove,-for it is a bitter cold night?" "Yes, Mrs. Rogan, I was just peeping out to see if Cor- mae was coming." ; Oh, he'll be here presently," was the reply. As the words were spoken, in dashed a -strong and stal-- wart-looking man, wrapped in a huge coat, and covered with snow. "Behind time, good wife," said Cormac. "But I just thought I would make a call on my way home, and learn if our young priest had any objection to spend a part of Christmas day with us." 'And he is sure to come," said Mrs. Kate Rogan, with one of her pleasant, happy smiles. "Yes; and he promised to bring John McXA/ley Rogan a Christmas present," added Cormac, taking a young cherub from its mother's arms. Next evening was a happy one in the house of Cormac Rogan. There was the priest at -the head of the table. There were John Mullan and his handsome wife, Brigid, acontented pair, and well-to-do in the world. True, they were three or four thousand miles away from     rhtHE PIKErIEN OF NINETY-EIGHT.     23 the kith and kin of their own dear Ireland. But such is life. After many a cheerful discourse on times and friends now passed away, Mrs. Mullan insisted on having a song from Cormac. "I would willingly comply, but I'm afraid I would make Kate too happy and too proud." "Never mind me, " replied his wife. "I am happy and proud as it is, and not likely to have my vanity increased by anything you can say or do just now." "All right, then, here goes," exultingly exclaimed Cor- mac, who sang the following:-- "MY OWN DEAR KATE. "My own dear Kate, my peerless queen, Girl of my heart, I love thee! The proudest maid that e'er was seen I would not place above thee. Dear to my heart in days gone by, When danger hovered o'er mue, When love-light beamed from every eye, To see was to adore thee. "My worship was the flame of youth, As pure as incense burning; My heart the censer filled with truth, And yours the truth returning. No wonder I recall the spell That held me closely bound; It wove my destiny so well, - A prize was by it found. "A prize? ah! yes; a priceless pearl,  A gem so brightly gleaming; And thou'rt the prize, my own dear girl, With love and virtue beaming. Then here's my Kate, my wife, my all, My joy, my light serene; And here's the men who at my call Came forth to guard the Green;" saying-which, Cormac dashed off the contents of a glass that stood before him,      A   224    TiHEi IRISH WIDOW'S SON. "No increase of- vanity, Mrs. Rogan?, inquired Mrs. Mullan. "Not in the least, " answered Kate. "Before song and sentiment," said the young clergy- man, who, by the way, was a relation of the Rogans, "I like to hold conversation with those who took part in the Irish Rebellion of NlNE'LTY EIGHT!" The conversation was resumed by Cormac and John. It consisted chiefly in rehearsing the facts already related in the foregoing chapters. That was a happy meeting. Cormac became eloquent in telling how Father McAuley died-full of innocence and hope, expressing his love of Ireland, and Ireland's glorious Church. Pat Dolan kept his promise, and lived out his time in the Old Land. His son-in-law, Peter, helped to make his last days glide on in peace and prayer. Cormac Rogan faithfully remembered his promises to all those who had befriended him. When he and his wife were dead and gone, his family fulfilled his wishes in every respect. There are descendants of that family alive and well. No truer hearts beat for Ireland to-day than theirs; and whether they are members of a certain Irish organiza- tion is left to the reader to imagine. One thing may be said of them: they are the worthy descendants of the IBISH WIDOW'S SON! ' Alas! that Might can vanquish Eight- They feU and passed away; But true men, like you, men, Are plenty here to-day." THE END.
