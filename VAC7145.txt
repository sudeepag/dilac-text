                 THE LOST ROSARY; OR, OUR IRISH GIRLS: THEIR TRIALS, TEMPTATIONS, AND TRIUMPHS. BY CON O'LEARY.  BOSTON : PUBLISHED BY PATRICK DONAHOOE. 1870.    DEDICATION. 3 THE EVER FAITHFUL IRISH GIRLS IN AMERICA, OSE AFFECTIONATE DEVOTION TO THEIR KITH AND KIN IN THE OLD LAND, HAS PROVED THAT VIRTUE AND CHARITY, RESULTS OF PIOUS AND CAREFUL TRAINING IN  YOUTH, UNLESSENED BY DISTANCE AND END ONLY WITH "FE ITSELF, THS VOLUME, IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.   PREFACE. AT the suggestion of Patrick Donahoe, Esq., the emi-  nent Irish and Catholic Publisher of America, and aided by his wise experience, the Author devoted himself for a short time to the production of this volume. The Story is necessarily a simple one, although it is to be hoped that. the style and aim of the writer will prove sufficiently attractive to redeem the book from the charge of weakness or tameness. Those who have made the question of which it treats, a study for themselves or others, cannot fail to recog- nize in these pages a few, at least, of the startling truths which it reveals. Emigration from Ireland to America has not been, and is not, either a permanent or an unmixed good. True, it has given to many the means of a better material ex- istence, sometimes, it must be acknowledged, at a fear- ful cost, namely-the loss of faith. From this it must not be inferred that a large number of OUR IRISH GIRLS have fallenfrom their religion, or, the practise of those virtues which adorned them at Home. Whatever expe- rience I possess-and I flatter myself it is somewhat ex- tensive-leads me to an opposite conclusion; and I am happy and proud at the opportunity thus afforded me, of bearing my impartial and unprejudiced testimony to the pleasing fact, that our emigrant girls have, in the face of many troubles and vexations, heroically adhered to that Faith, and to those rare virtues which were their dis- tinguishing traits in Ireland. Even some of our best intentioned writers, from some cause or another which 5   vi         Preface. appears plain to no one but themselves, have lamented the fall of the poor Irish emigrant from the high estate of virtue and religion. It is not true. If, in this in- stance, we look for angelic perfection, we shall be disap- pointed as we would in any other case; but if I am to believe the evidence of my own senses, and the willing testimony of many good pastors, I emphatically assert that the emigrant Irish girl, taking that body as a whole, is equally as careful of her religious training and the du- ties of her state, as the most ardent friend could desire. There is a very prevalent fallacy in Ireland on mat- ters under this head. Some people there believe that life in America is destructive of morality. This betok- ens either a want of faith or ignorance. In nearly every instance, the opportunities of attending to all es- sentially religious duties in America are just as good as at home. There are some exceptions undoubtedly; but these very exceptions- are as much in favor of America, as others may be in favor of Ireland. It would be folly to deny that temptations in our large cities, and those especially on the eastern seaboard, are more numerous than may be found in the towns of Ire- land. That only proves that in the midst of a teeming population, there is more vice and wretchedness than in the smaller country towns and country places where temptations less abound. The genuinely true hearted Irish girl is safe wherever she goes. Her virtue is a wall of adamant, supported by the Sacraments of the Church, -which are as effectual here as elsewhere. We would guard the Irish maiden, whether alone or protected; and we feel confident that the perusal of this book will afford something to feel thankful for, whether on the part of ourselves or others. , The title of this book is divided as to Ownership. There is not much in that, but I choose to notice it here.   Preface.         vii "The Lost Rosary" belongs to the Author; "Our Irish Girls, their Trials, Temptations and Triumphs," belongs to the Publisher. The very title is indicative, in some measure at least, of the nature and character of the Story. I am not aware that the subject has been treated by others. It is a fruitful theme; and a vast, unexplored field is still open for others to cultivate. The majority of our IRISH GIRLS are honest hard workers. Their leisure time for pleasant or instructive reading is rather limited. This, in itself, is an evil; and all such evils re- coil, less or more, on the heads of families and others in whose employment they are engaged. I trust it will not be deemed impertinent in the Author of this volume to bespeak at the hands of the employ- ers, and especially Catholic employers, of our Irish Girls, a careful and kindly supervision, which will include op- portunities of attending to religious duties. Such kind- ness brings its own reward, besides fostering virtue in the minds of those whom we are bound to protect. Op- portunities should be given for reading and for learning to read; and I venture to hope that heads of families, and guardians of children, will freely give all the aid in their power to have this book widely circulated. Those who know the Author, will readily understand that there is no motive of selfishness in thus desiring a large circulation for such a work. Higherrand, I trust, nobler aims -were kept before the Author's mind, in bring- ing out the work. It is difficult to speak on this deli- cate point, for the world is so fast verging on universal materialism, that the best motives and the best acts of some are misunderstood. I bespeak for this book a kindly reception, therefore; and I hope that our IRISH GIRLS will profit by every line of what is written specially for their benefit. 4                i   viii        Preface. The general reader will not, I hope, feelless interest in following the history of the LOST ROSARY, any more than the class for whose benefit the volume is produced. We all require encouragement in the discharge of our duties in life. I have endeavored to do so in my line,- will the PUB- "C-that great guide and mover of men's minds--afford me some in return? There are many hard days of trial, in writing a volume, when every thought and word has to be carefully weighed, before it is put on paper; so that virtue and goodness of heart may be rendered beau- tiful for their own sakes. Compensation for all this, is seldom looked for in the commercial transaction that calls forth the work; at least, it is not so in this instance; but due compensation is afforded by the spread of the writer's views, as an antidote to the filthy and deadly poison that issues in streams from the immoral and irreligious press of this country. I feel confident that the Catholics of America do not sufficiently, as yet, realize the enormity of the evils that result from an impure literature. Many of them do; but we should one and all do our part. Carelessness in this respect, is an unpardonable omission. Should the present volume succeed in banishing some portion of the prevalent bad literature from the family circle, where it may inadvertently have obtained admis- sion, and, above all, should it be the means of pointing the right way or guarding against evil in any shape, the Author will rest satisfied that his labor has not been per- formed in vain.

"1 would not give my Irish wife For all the dames of the Saxon land- I would not give my Irish wife For the Queen of France's hand: For she to me is dearer Than castles strong, or lands, or life,- In death I would lie near her, And rise beside my Irish wife." "GOOD evening, O'Leary." "Good evening, Mac."' - Still busy at work, I see." "Doing a little, occasionally." "What are you up to now?" "Nothing particular-just thinkinga little. I had the pleasure of a very lengthened conversation with Mrs. McAuley to-day, and I have been ruminating over it." "She's a fine woman, is Mrs. McAuley. I rather like that daughter of hers; that is, when she is dressed up of an evening. But, hang it, she looks very like a country maid during the day, with her arms bare to the shoul- ders, and as red as carrots." "Yes, she is healthy. Smart, too, don't you think?" "Well, after a fashion." "Do you think she looks like one who would give much for your opinion of her?"   2       Introductory Dialogue.  "'Pon my word, I never gave as many thoughts about the girl before. But what are you driving at? Are you quizzing me?"  "O, dear, no. I'm only wondering what the young lady would think if she heard you." "Heard me! Why, I believe she would be very highly pleased with any notice I might deign to offer her." t "Most likely." "Look here, now. There you sit, O'Leary, in that con- founded old machine of a chair of yours, wrapped up in your antiquated notions of things, not fit to understand a fellow, and persistently humbugging me whenever I speak a word." "Heavy charges, Mac, very heavy." "Well, why; but you thinkl and speak like an ordinary mortal?" "I don't choose." "No. You don't choose, because you cannot. You never go out of an evening. I never saw you, not even once, pitch your work overboard for a day, and mix in an hour's gaiety." "How long is it, Mac, since I first saw you?" "About a year, I suppose." "About a year!-and your, unmitigated puppyism makes you talk to me in that fashion. Why, my good fellow, I have mixed more in society-and, what is bet- ter, to some advantage-in six months, than you have done in all your life." "I know you have. I was only jesting, and you knew it., "To be sure, I knew it. But, didn't I see your usual vanity spread itself over your nostrils, when 'speaking of Miss McAuley." "I wouldn't give a dollar for the girl." "Nor she a cent for you." '" rm not sure of that."   Introductory Dialogue.       3 "There it is again." "There's what again?" "Why, your vanity, of course." "O, bother! vanity! I want no lecturing. Come, are you for a spell to-night?" "Where?" "At the Athenaeum." "What's up?" "A lecture on 'Woman's Rights,' by a glorious crea- ture." "On ' Woman's Rights?' " "Yes." "I'm your man." "At 8 o'clock." "All right."   Next morning, I received another visit from friend Mac. He was one of those who are easily caught by the noise and glare of new questions. He was also a sort of stickler for this thing called "Woman's Rights," and I determined to have a turn with him on his pet subject. In he walked. "By Jove, O'Leary, I'm as proud and as glad as possi- ble, that I had the good luck to mention about the lec- ture to you yesterday. I saw you were pleased, but my engagement with Miss --, deprived me of calling for you, and of hearing your opinion when all was over, about what you saw and heard. How did you feel?" "Disgusted!" "At what?" "At all I saw and heard." "Ahem! You weren't disgusted with the company, I hope?" "4 Most decidedly." "And you, yourself, one of the party?" "Even so. I was disgusted at myself, too, for not ris- ing and walking out."   4      Introductory Dialogue. "Oh, I see; you're in one of your sulky, cynic moods; disposed to find fault with everything and everybody alike. Take rest and physic, O'Leary. Good morning." I "Oh, good morning, and good luck to you I Be off as soon as you like." ( What if I, too, got ill-natured, like yourself. Now, that I think of it, I'll do so. Here I am now, down in your best chair; and, goodness knows, your best is bad enough. Come, now, I want your opinion candidly about ' Woman's Rights.' Don't you think there was a good deal of truth in what the fair lecturer said last night? You remember where she said, ' The genius of the so-called woman's movement is not generally com- prehended.'" "Yes; I remember that, and I agreed with her. It is not so easy to comprehend that which is incomprehen- sible." "But mind what followed. She maintained that it meant' woman's complete enfranchisement and eman- cipation from the control of her masculine master.' Do you recollect that?" "Oh, perfectly!" "Andj don't you think she was quite right, now?" "Oh, by all means! and especially when she said, ' Wo- man's Rights intended, among other things, that the se- lection of companions in the most sacred relation of the sexes shall not be the exclusive prerogative of man; if, indeed, as physiological laws and comparison would seem to indicate, the first right to woo be not surrender- ed to woman.' That's the point, Mac, my boy." "Well, it wouldn't be a bad thing to be courted by a pretty girl, after all." "What about the ordinary looking, or ugly?" "Not so pleasant, I confess." "What about the bold and bad?" "Reject them." ,R m WmTn' Rns Ri-ht a will enforce vour acceptance."   Introductory Dialogue.        5 "I don't like that part of the business; but, as to the matter of courtship, a woman can reject a man if she don't like him; so that the present order of wooing is, after all, perhaps, the best."' "But worse follows. See with what emphasis the lec- turer declared--' I hereby warn all who are favorably inclined to this question, that in its granting, the knife is placed at the throat of the present marriage system. Those who would preserve that system inviolate as the keystone of the arch of social safety, should understand this.' '" "Well, that's a plain and candid avowal, at all events. You can't deny so much." "I deny nothing, Mac. I defy any one to use worse language; to propound any doctrine of a more hellish tendency. Its boldness, presumption, and coarseness are only equalled by the hidden villany contained in such announcements. 'Woman's Rights,' as understood by your fair lecturer, are devil's rights, calculated to destroy virtue; to prostitute all that we love and admire, even to the lowest depths of infamy; to raze society to its foundations, and plunge the good and true into the same maelstrom of vice which the promoters of this question are creating!" "Strong language, O'Leary, very strong indeed." "Admitted. How can we speak tamely and respecte fully of those who talk about placing the knife at the throat of the present marriage system?" "After all, you cannot deny that women are entitled to full and perfect freedom?" "They have that freedom, socially, as far as I can see." "But, politically?" " "I'm not thinking, just now, of political freedpm; I have only spoken of social freedom, you'll observe." "But I go in for both." "Go in for whatever you like."    6      Introductory Dialoguze. "But women really deserve to possess the fullest free- dom in all things." "No, sir. Neither men, women, nor children, deserve to possess the fullest freedom in all things." "I have said what I believe.' "Yes; but your belief don't amount to much." "You are not over complimentary, O'Leary." "No, nor didn't intend it at the beginning of this con- versation; for the subject won't permit me." "Well, we'll drop it, old fellow. I confess, candidly, I know less about it than I had believed." ' I know that. After all, I am rather pleased at its introduction."  "If you are pleased, so am I." "Quite so. The question of Woman's Rights, like many others of the present day, is one of those bubbles that float on the air as long as there is a ray of sunshine -public attention-to make it attractive. The first lit- tle breath of wind explodes the delusion, and-nothing remains., "Well, then, seriously, what are your views on the whole question?" ' My views are simply these:-Woman has been raised to the highest pinnacle by the Church of God." Ah! I like that." "I knew you would." "You are thinking of our Blessed Lady, now." "I am. I am just thinking of the Blessed Virgin lMary, the Mother of God-I always chose to speak of her in that homely old Irish way-anld, in consequence of the dignity attached to her name, to the mystery of her life, to the stupendous graces vouchsafed to her, woman has been raised to the most exalted position, and , dignified beyond anything that society can confer."  "It is impossible that I should disagree with any-  thing you say, when you take such a standpoint as that."  - That is the proper standpoint to take."      )   Introductory Dialogue. ' Catholics will be sure to agree with you in all you couldadvance on that subject. But there are others, not a few of whom will laugh at you; some, again, there are, who will long for an opportunity to jump at you and clutch you by the throat." "And may there not be some, even non-Catholics, who will gently nod their heads, and say-' He's quite right?" "I don't doubt it in the least. Do you intend making public your views on this matter?" "I am not quite certain that I shall. I have had it in contemplation to write a work on our IRISHE GIRLS, and shall probably introduce it with a report of our conver- sation last evening and to-day." "Qui bono?" "Well, I shall find an opportunity of guarding those who are yet clean of this social leprosy, against its con- tamination, and that will be something gained.'" "Then you will introduce-it into your new work?" "Not directly, perhaps. It is sufficient to make virtue attractive, without the diabolical subterfuge of exposing vice in all its deformity, in order to make our readers love the one and shun the other." "True. But, in a worldly sense, there is little pros- perity attends such a course. The use of a strong brush in depicting the vices and follies of mankind, is better received now-a-days." "That is the chief curse of the literature of the pres- ent day. It is so easy and pleasant to say-' T am only i depicting vice, good reader, in order that you may shun it.' Many people hug this delusion to their hearts, -who would otherwise have remtained pure, and escaped the snare so artfully laid." "You know the penalty, O'Leary, of appearing virtu- ous, I suppose?" "Oh! hang your penalties, and your jeers of fools; no man dreads them. There is no class of people I am so   i                    \ 8      Introductory Dialogue.  intolerant of, and impatient with, as those Catholics who consider it manly to prate in such fashion." "I see you understand me. " ' Perfectly. I know something of that class. Fellows who try to laugh if they hear you say you go to church of a Sunday; that you were present at Mass on a holi- day; or that you considered it your duty not to join them in eating flesh-meat on a Friday." "I hope you are not getting personal, O'Leary. " "If you find anything I have said applicable to your- self, you may apply it or not, as you like. " - Remember we are in a free country, and people here are different from what they are in the Ol Country. " "I know it. But why should they be different? Are their souls less valuable here than in Ireland?" "I should think not." "Yet it would appear so. Are our chances of salva- tion better here than at home?" "Not that I can see." "And yet, you talk of a free country as a sort of excuse for liberties taken, for duties omitted, and as entitling you to sneer at virtue and religion. " 1 must admit the truth of what you say, but is it not rather boldly announced?" "I like boldness in speaking of such matters, and for this reason: those whose practices are as I have stated, are hypocrites. They are also moral cowards, for moral cowardice and hypocrisy are nearly akin. Such people speak differently from the promptings of their - own hearts, therefore they are liars, and in silence they regret their deviation from the line of rectitude to which they were attached by early trainig A" "You will embody these things in your story.  ' I shall make the attempt. " "Then I wish you every success, O'Leary. " "Thanks, Mac. I know you do. We are friends after all-good-by. "   THE LOST ROSARY; OR, OUR IRISH1 GIRILS: THFiTR TRIALSj TEMPTATIONS   AND TRIUMPHS. CHAPTER I. MAY EVE-SPORTS OF THE PEASANTRY. "The young May moon is beaming, love, The stars are gently gleaming, love. How sweet to rove Through Morna's grove, While the drowsy world is dreaming, love." MAWY EVE, MA&Y DAY.   MAY, the Mother of the Months! What sweet recollections spring up in the mind at the thought of May! Recollections dear to every heart, recalling the May of youth, the happy hours of innocence, ere yet the shadow of sin had obscured the bright hours of boyhood, or maidenhood; when the morning of life was tinged with the roseate hues and glowing charms of a vivid imagination; when the heart thrilled in responsive melody to the music of the lark and the thrush, twin choristers of Spring. Dear to us all are such recollections; dearer in consequence of those days being passed and never to be recalled, exceptin the   10       The Lost Rosary. shadowy outlines of a memory made treacherous by its  conflicts with the world.  HAPPY MAY! When the bloom of the hawthorn offers its incense to nature, and gladdens every eye with its milk-white beauties. HAPPY MAY! When the light-hearted youths of Ire- land, frolicsome and gleeful, go a-naying over moss and L glen, to gather the golden flowers, whose magic spell  around the cabin door preserves the humble home from  all the spiteful influences and tricks of fairy-land. i It was May Eve, and old Corny O'Donnell determined - to give the boys and girls of his neighborhood a night's  fun. Wise old Corny. He had a three-acre field, damp, sour, and marshy, over which he wished there were a dozen or two cart-loads of good dry ashes thrown. What so easy as for a lot of the boys to wheel a " wheen  o' barrowsful -of turf and sods into that -field? set  them going in the morning, and, by evening, have the  ashes scattered over the ground, thus giving good May f sport to as many as wished to join in the work. "Just as good -as lime, every bit of it, an' cheaper," said Corny to himself.  That was the old man's plan of converting a festive  occasion to some account. The chances were, he would not have succeeded so well in making his arrangements, if he had not included the extravagant undertaking of providing a fiddler, and giving the use of his barn for a wind-up to the evening's sports.          \ The cost of the fiddler was only a warm supper, anid  his "chances" among those who would "occupy the  floor " but, if blithe Barney McAuley or Timothy Heg- j garty could be reckoned on being present, the fiddler's  "chances " were good for half-a-crown.        Barney McAuley and Tim Heggarty were cousins,   ; nearly of the same age, not unlike each other in features,  about the same weight and height,.and both capital    The Lost Rosary.        " dancers. Few finer specimens of manhood could be found in their native townland of Mazheramore, in the parish of Clonmany,Donegal, than Barney and Tim; and any undertaking of the kind proposed. by old Corny O'Donnell, was sure to be successful, if the cousins could be prevailed upon to join it, or give it a helping hand. Corny had a beautiful young daughter, whose be- witching smile had played all sorts of pranks with Bar- ney McAuley's heart. Corny knew this, but nothing could be further from his mind than the idea of accept- ing Barney as a son-in-law. Then Mary O'Donnell had a cousin called Ailey, an orphan girl, who resided with a cross, old aunt, and Corny half suspected that Tim Heggarty had found favor in his niece's eyes. At the in- terview with the young men, he slyly hinted that Mary and Alley were sure to be at home that evening, and would tidy up the barn. In consequence of this timely hint, Barney and Tim were easily prevailed on to transfer their allegiance from a neighboring dance, in- order to light the Beltaine in Corny's field. As the morning of May Eve dawned, Barney and Tim, with over a dozen comrades, gladdened the heart of old Corny with a grantd turnout of fuel for the fires. "Marciful gracious! Biddy, look here," exclaimed Cor- ny to his wife, as he beheld no less than six cart-loads of good turf, and as many wheelbarrows, heaped and packed with the same sort of fuel, all wending their way to the appointed ground. Sods were speedily turned up by a dozen spades, and, in less than " no time," thirty or forty fires were set a-going, sending up their columns of fra- grant smoke, and giving good promise of being in fine order for the evening. Corny stood by, rubbing his hands in great glee. Boys, I see,' said he, " that you intend to have some sport ere nightfall. 'Pon- my word, it's a good half-   ! 12       The Lost Rosary. guinea you ought to pay me for the use of such a fine level field, so it is." "Mind your eye, old weathercock, or half a guinea I won't free you in the expense of a treat, this good May ' Eve morning," replied one of the party. Corny chuckled at such an idea, but said nothing fur- ther, lest he might get himself into an " unpleasant fix- ture," as he termed it. Some of the girls from the neighboring farm-houses  observed the procession of turf-carts, and, knowing that  wherever they stopped, there the evening sports would run fast and furious, had gathered together on the road- side to watch the operations in which the young men were engaged. Corny was delighted to see them, and told them to be sure and deck themselves out in their best for the even- ing. These were his friends in the field over beyond, who had insisted on lighting their May fires there, and he wouldn't be the least astonished if they forced 7 him and Biddy, against their will, to yield up their barn to them for the evening. "Sly old Corny I " said one of the girls to a companion; "the barn is newly floored and he wants it well beaten, without the expense of inviting the neighbors." "Troth, an' we'll bate it for him," said another; " an' it's maybe into holes we'll bate it, afore mornin9." Evening came, and, a little after sundown, the young men who lighted the fires in the morning, hastened to see how sped the good work. The whole " country-side i was up.'2 Young and old were engaged in rambles and  athletic sports, some in the meadows, some on the road- \ side, and some on the Alls. Everywhere there was rac- ing, and chasing, and harmless amusements. If those engaged in them had been asked why they did so, they  would probably have replied-'Because it was May  Eve."                       i   The ILost Rosary.        13 "But why on May Eve, more than on any other Eve?" "Well, it is customary," would iave been the answer. "Just so; and a right good custom it is; descended down from the time when our forefathers were Pagans, and in ages after permitted by the Church to continue as a recreation; thus proving her wisdom in changing, and in many instances sanctifying,instead of destroying popular customs." Lots of exercise and fun-the best medicine and the best doctor ever yet discovered; and these votaries of both were splendid examples of the care of the doctor, and the freshness and usefulness of the medicine. There they were, boys and girls, with breaths as sweet as the fragrance of the herbs and wild flowers crushed beneath their feet; and with cheeks that bespoke the crimson and purity of roses and lilies in June. Girls romping about, neither last in the chase, nor behind at a good spring or hop over ditch or hedge; comely and beautiful, artless and innocent, but withal modest in speech and in act. Many of them had the hard and bitter struggle with life,-up with the dawn, and down .with the starlight; concealing from the eyes of the- world their struggles with poverty; preserving a decent exterior, and, in not a few instances, the only support that was left to aged I  and helpless relatives. In what other part of the world may be found so many instances of devotion among girls? Even those of a tender age, well and carefully reared, yet willing in the hour of distress to forget everything but their love for those depending on their exertions, have gone forth to help in field labor; to work on farms in any capacity whatever that would bring relief to those at home. And how often do we hear the bitter and cruel taunt, "so coarse, so Irish, so Biddy-like,"-words that fall on our ears like blasphemy, for those who utter them -are the flippant nonentities of our cities, who know as much about real worth as their mothers did to rear a family.   "       The Lost Rosary. Was it -their seclusion from the busy world; was it their poverty, or their rustic habits and simplicity, that  made them so beautiful? Beautiful they certainly were, I those girls to whom I allude, although- their toilets were neither fashionable nor costly. It may seem strange to ' make the inquiry, if their poverty had anything to do \ with their personal charms; yet, it is the fact that ad- i versity often begets beauty -that did not exist under better circumstances. When resignedly and cheerfully  ! borne, even poverty is a beautifier.          7 This hint is thrown out for the benefit of those who are only middling-looking, and who tremble at the frights they would become if poorer than what they are. Then, as to the young men, some of them were good looking, and some were not; that is, judging by their features. They were all cast in a manly mould, of good stature, lithe of limb, strong of muscle, broad-shouldered, deep-chested; i with crisp curling hair, and rough hands that had never made the acquaintance of scented soap or kid gloves.  I Indeed, in the latter respect, they were on a par with the girls of the country. The clothing of these young fellows partook in some measure of their own character. It was of strong, home- made frieze cloth, made to resist a tugand a pull, as well as a good down pour of rain; for, these fellows worked in the fields winter and summer, in sunshine and rain. Take in those groups at a glance as they catch hands and whirl around the May fires now blazing all over the' country; but, pay marked attention to those in Corny -  O'Donnell's field. You may travel a good distance and f  lack again, from the country they were born in, before yu find their equal. There is little method or order in the fun in which all are now engaged. There is a circle of young people around one of the fires, sitting on the margin of dry ground, telling stories about fairies, in which the most   The Lost Rosary.        15 wondrous incidents are related. Such, for instance, as that of the farmer, who insisted on removing a large thorn bush that grew right in the centre of his potato field. Everybody advised him against the act, but he heeded neither warning nor advice, and the morning following this act of agricultural desecration, he awoke with every hair on his head as "white as a streak of flax." Then there was another, who ploughed too closely to a rath his child was bewitched in its cradle six weeks after it was born, and its eyes were turned in its head. As the clouds of night darken all around, the young men amuse themselves by jumping over the fires. It is but fair to state that many attempt the feat, because there are dozens of pairs of bright laughing eyes among the promiscuous audience. Tim Heggarty gives a hop, step, and jump, and shout- ing out, "Follow the leader, boys," scampers away, jump- ing clean over one fire, then another, and another, fol- lowed by all of the daring spirits present. Those who were seated enjoying themselves as described, hastily sprang up lest some mishap might befall them. Many of the young fellows are longer in the legs than others of their companions; this, and the uneven build of the May fires, some high, some low, accounts for the accidents a la posterior, which fall to the lot of some, and makes the air ring with the laughter of the bystanders. Corny enjoys the fun vastly, for, in a short time, the field is cov- ered with the burning turf and sods. Many of these are flung on high, and those who attempt to escape from the falling sparks generally manage to run to the very spot where the largest numbers fall. Tired and delighted with their sport, those who were in Corny's field, accompanied by their female compan-, ions, retired to the barn. Rude seats were placed around, and the place was illuminated by a full dozen of candles.   16       The Lost Rosary. Such extravagance was never observed there before, and the visitors imaained that sometling had happened to "S^^^T'f^'^S^-Shav inule friend Corny, otherwise he would never have indulged in such a display. Some of the more knowing ones guessed rightly that Mary and Ailey O'Donnell had some- thing to do with the arrangements, and surmised there- from that the whole was an effort to catch the attentions of Barney and Tim. In such smallmatters, criticism is just as sharp in coun- Insch smallmatters try life as in more pretentious and costly entertainments in the oities, but wanting in the ill-natured stings that accompany the latter.

Memory wakes her magic trance, And wings me lightly through the dance; Let me, while the wild and young Trip the mazy dance along, Fling my heap of years away, And be as wild, as young as they." BLIND Darby, the fiddler, was on his high horse; that is, he was seated on the top of a barrel, with a sack doubled under him to make his position "nice and aisy,' for it is well known that all musicians must be comfort- ably seated before they can perform either to their own satisfaction, or with pleasure to their audience. Darby rosined his bow, tuned his instrument, screwed and unscrewed the pegs, and performed all the unpleas- ant overtures that rack the hearts and ears of the impa- tient crowd, whose toes are tingling for the floor. "Arrah, bad cess to you for a pack of asses," cried out one of the company; " don't you see that the rheumatiz is in Darby's right elbow." This was a hint for an in- ward " rosiner," which Darby seconded by a smack of his lips. To the astonishment of all who knew him, old Corny rushed out, and instantly returned with a drop of real Inishowen. He charitably brought it in a cup, which deprived the eyes of the inquisitive from seeing how 2   18       The Lost Rosary. much it contained, but the effort of Darby to swallow the contents at one operation, spoke eloquently of Cor- ny's large-heartedness. Some  hanged knowing winks, and disrespectfully hinted thatCorny had made an attempt to become poP- ular at somebody's expense. True or false, it is often so with the world. On this occasion, Corny gave what be- longed to himself; hut it cannot be denied that he had tted the mountain dew himself, and this might account for his liberality. A1l being-ready, a dozen pairs of feet engaged in the merry jig and reel. On they went at it with as much blithesome spirit as if they had known no fatigue with day's work, or out-door evening sport. It was soon evident that blind Darby required all he got to keep up the steam. The demands made on him for "Cabbage and Pork," "Laugh and grow fat," I Bury my wife an' dance on the top of her," Moll in theWad" and "Irish Washerwoman," kept his greased elbow go- ing at the rate of " a forty horse power;" at least he said so himself, and no one had a better right to kinow. The first three or four sets over, Corny could stand it no longer. He was a changed man that night. Barney McAuley didn't make the slightest attempt (so far) to engross his daughter's attention. True, Ailey and Timn appeared inseparable,.but he didn't care for that; iln fact, he rather liked it, so here goes. Up he sprang like a young fellow, made a clutch at Biddy, who screamed withl the pain occasioned by the sudden jerk she had received, and, to the astonishment of all and delight of some, call- ed out to Darby " to make the fiddle spake and scrape a bar of ' Tatter Jack Walsh.'       f Wonderful performance! Corny and Biddyfooted it right and left; up and down they went most creditably; for, was n t Corny's field well dusted that day at as cheap a rate as even he could wish. "Hurrah, for Corny!" was   ?The Lost Rosary.  oil to his joints, while, "Go it, Biddy," made his partner forget the half of her age at least. A few minutes sufficed for the old couple, who sat down quite exhausted; and would have kept on cough- ing till now, but for the thoughtfulness of Tim Eeggar- ty, who, like a skilful physician, immediately came to their relief with a cough mixture of his own. Biddy maintained that Tim was a gentleman. This was said while she threw a discouraging glance at Bar- ney; and Corny boldly asserted that "Tim was more than a gentleman,-he was a rale doctor." The dancing exercise, and cough mixture made by Tim, soon produced a sort of drowsiness in Corny and his wife, who begged the company to excuse them while they retired to their rest. Corny gave a jerk of his head, motioning to his daugh- ter to leave also; but Biddy, remembering that a tender flame once lighted up her own existence, gallantly took her old man by the arm, remarking at the same time, in a tonie loud enough for all who had ears to hear, "Come on, you crazy ould dolt; she's in better company than ever her mother was when I was just her age." Corny was anything but a hen-pecked husband; but his wife's arm appeared as if renewed with some of its youthful vigor, and the jerk he received drove every idea, if he had the like, of remonstrance out of his head. Corny O'Donnell had very few 11 strong weaknesses." He had a few,-however, and one of them was his love for his cutty pipe. In the use of this article he indulged pretty freely; but it was immediately before retiring to bed that he went about the work of filling it with all the deliberation of a philosopher. To see his face beaming with radiance as he applied a piece of hot turf to the bowl of the pipe, was enough to make a man envious of his happiness. He could pick out the best burned nut of turf on the hearth, and as he lifted it between the tongs, and   20       The Lost Rosary. placed it near his mouth to blow away the fine dandrift that enshrouded the sparkling gem, his cheeks were diffused with the glowing heat that lent a charm to every wrinkle of his leather-skinned face. The first whiff awakened the cogitations of his heart in those silent hours of the night, and Biddy was at these times generally treated to a full digest of the inner workings of his mind. "Into that bed I'll not lay a side this good night, till Mary O'Donnell is under her own roof," began Corny. There was no reply, for Biddy was at her prayers. "It's mighty deaf you're gettin', all of a sudden," he continued. Silently there came a few well-timed puffs, puff-f-f, puff-f-puff-f-f. Corny was thinking; a bad sign for his peace of mind. "I think that hussy is long enough out of her house. D'ye hear me now, I'm sayin'?" then raising his voice to a higher pitch: "Maybe it's slippin' out yourself will be when I'm in the middle o' my first innocent sleep, for an hour's gallivantin' with some o' the young fellows. That's jist what comes o' a bit o' kindness, and ' Tatter Jack Walsh,' but I'll watch both o' you." "--into temptation, but deliver us from all evil. Amen!" floated incoherently to Corny's ears. Then laying down his pipe with a terrible resolve, he slipped over to an old cupboard, and applied something to his- mouth, after which he exclaimed, "I'll let you see whether there's no temptation or not," saying which Corny unbolted the door, and went out. "Sorrow's in the ould fool," exclaimed Biddy; "what is he about at all, that he can't let the young ones have a minute's pace by themselves?" Scarcely were the words out of her lips than Corny rushed in like one demented. "Biddy, Biddy!" he shouted, as he came bump up against her at the entrance of the door.   The Lost Rosary.        21 "What on earth is the matter with you, you old do- tard?" asked his wife. "Gone, lost!" he shouted, letting himself slide down into his old rush-bottomed chair. "What's gone? Who's lost?" she asked, eagerly. But Corny could only point toward the barn. Biddy ran to try and find out the meaning of her old man's perplexity. There, sure enough, was the barn quite deserted, the most of the candles blown out, for the doors had been left wide open. Back she ran into the house wringing her hands, shout- ing, "Corny, dear, I see it all, I see it all I O, mother o' Moses, what's all this for, at all at all?" If Biddy was deaf before, Corny was now dumb. "Can't you spake?" she cried, shaking him by the shoulder. "No," he drawled forth," I'm spacheless!" Then there came floating on the night wind the sounds of distant laughter; atone time hollow and hoarse, anon shrieking and weird-like. "Presarve us an' bless us, Corny dear; did you hear that?"            \ "Do I hear it, you say? Yes. I hear it, an' am glad that you hear it, too. You could n't hear me a few min- utes ago, when I bawled out to you." "Yes, I heard you, Corny, but I was at my prayers when you spoke." "You may go to them again, I'm thinkin'," was the surly reply. "There it 's once more-between us an' all harm," said Biddy, blessing herself, and falling down on her knees, giving a side glance at Corny at the same time. The sounds were indeed strange. Heard at that hour of the night, when all was still and quiet, they appeared like the wailing of ghosts-ghosts always wail whenever they condescend to make a noise-so unearthly loud   22       The Lost Rosary. were they, now distant, now near, mingled with shouts and screams, such as were never heard before. "Were there any May-flowers scattered before the door to-day?" inquired Corny, while drops of perspira- tion oozed out all over his face. The tortures of his mind may be guessed at, by the violence of nature in forcing such huge drops through such a surface. "That accounts for it, Corny dear," cried Biddy, through her tears, while her right eye kept blinking. Corny accepted this as an answer, and groaned as he fully comprehended the whole nature of this neglect. "Lay aside a dish of meal for the first poor wander- er that comes to this door," said the old man, almost rev- erently. Biddy attended to his instructions, muttering half aloud, as she did so, prayers for the safety of her daugh- ter and for Barney. "Don't speak of him," cried Corny, passionately. "He is the cause of all this. Rather, pray for poor Tim, so kind-hearted and so good, and for poor Ailey; poor things! Where on earth have they been taken to?" and Corny buried his face in his hands. . If an electric bat- tery had been placed beneath the seats occupied by this humble and sorely-distressed pair, they could not have experienced a greater shock to their nerves than they re- ceived by the loud and sudden crowing of the cock, roost- ed nearly over their heads. The cock crowed but once, yet it seemed as if the crowing power of an ordinary bird's lifetime had been crowded into that one effort. Ah was again still as death; the laughter and screams had ceased. Corny had re-filled his pipe; Biddy was tell- ing her beads, praying that a certain poor man, who was credited by the country people as the possessor of super- natural knowledge, might be the first to enter the house in the morning to get the meal. Then there came home to the listening ears of both,   Tl'e Lost Rosary.       23 the softest, sweetest sound that ever greeted the disturbed senses of a lonely pair of afflicted mortals. There could be no mistaking that music. 'T was a fairy Laudamus for the haul they made that night. Presently the music appeared nearer and more distinct. Then all was silent again. What strange and undefinable feelings disturbed the minds of Corny and Biddy O'Donnell! ' Corny was greedy, and, like most greedy people, was far removcd above the possibility of want. He was fond of "gathering money," and paid the priest's dues at Easter and Christmas very reluctantly. Sometimes, but very seldom, he bestowed an alms upon the poor who came his way. He seldom made calculations so carefully as those in which the priest and the beggar were concerned. He would travel many a good mile on foot to borrow some farming implement which he required; and had he been wise as he was ungenerous, he would long since have arrived at the knowledge that the time thus spent was more valuable to him than the compliments he re- ceived from his neighbors so grudgingly. He had only one child to support, and Mary O'Donnell was worth more than she cost him. He had no friends or relations to trouble him for anything, and he was fast approach- ing a good old age. True, he and Biddy had heretofore enjoyed good health; but he had often heard that those so blessed were most likely to fall easy victims when their time came. These and such like thoughts now coursed through his mind and added to his pain. As for Biddy, she was trying to sustain herself as best she could. She was anything but sorry at the perplexi- ties of her husband. She did not exactly understand the unaccountable proceeding that left the barn tenantless; still she was shrewd enough to partake of all the horrors that beset Corny, and, if she did not add to them, to re- frain from mitigating them. Any little indulgences that she had ever obtained for Mary or for herself, were won   24       The Lost Rosary. by preying on her old man's fears as to what the neigh- bors would say, and such like little stratagems. "What is that, Biddy?" he exclaimed, as the sound of a fiddle was distinctly heard. "Faith, Corny, darlin', it's mighty like Darby's ould spaker." Up he jumped, and, after peering out, desired Biddy to follow him. Biddy grasped him tightly by the arm, and made her movements very slowly, as if anticipating some dire disaster; she breathed hurriedly and very distinctly, which had the desired effect of keeping poor Corny's nerves strung to their highest pitch. Both approached the barn door, and, peeping in, there, sure enough, they beheld the whole party dancing away, "just as if they had never had the glammery thrown over them, and transported, poor things, to some place of witchery." "The Lord be praised!" piously ejaculated Biddy, to which Corny responded with a devout "Amen!" The old couple retired to the house, and, after a mu- tual agreement that neither should ever breathe a sylla- ble of the horrors of that -night, Corny paid a second visit to the old cupboard, and-soon after fell asleep in his favorite old chair. The first blushes of May Day were streaking the East when the party in the barn broke up, and, after mutual leave-takings-of a different character from those which distinguish our fashionable balls-wended their way in groups of two and three to their respective homes. Mary O'Donnell prevailed on Alley to remain with her for that day at least, and, after a little coaxing, Ailey consented.   Tlhe Lost Rosary.        25 CTA PTER III. MATCH-MAKTING EXTRBAORDINARY AND HOW IT WAS CON- DUCTED. "'The flower of the valley was Mary Machree, Her smiles all bewitching were lovely to see; The bees round her humming, when summer is gone, When the roses were fled, might her lips take for one; Her laugh it was music, her breath it was balm, Her heart, like the lake, was as pure and as calm; Till love o'er it came, like a breeze o'er the sea, And made the heart heave of sweet Mary Machree." CORNY took a long sleep that morning. He had been dreaming, and, what was better, his dreams were pleas- ant. Biddy and her daughter had a quiet conversation be- tween themselves, while the " head of the house" lay wrapped in the mantle of Morpheus. "I'm sure you must all have had a pleasant night of it?" said Mrs. O'Donnell to Mary, by way of a beginning. "Pleasant! aye, it was indeed a pleasant, innocent amusement while it lasted; but that thief, Tim Heggarty, the moment he saw you and father safely into bed, noth- ing would do him but start that game of forfeits of his, which makes everybody split their sides laughing." "Thief you may well call him; but did he actually say he saw me and your father safely into the house?" in- terrupted her mother. "He said you were all gone to bed, and then shouted out: 'Come, now, boys and girls, the old people are   26       The Lost Rosary. snoozing by this time, let us enjoy ourselves;' saying which, he made poor Darby dismount, took his seat, and commenced giving out forfeits." "Well, and who got the first forfeit?" asked Mrs. O'D. "Who do you think, but Tim himself," said Mary, laughing heartily at the thought of what followed. Mary's was a good, hearty, ringing laugh, that made Corny turn in his chair, and brought Ailey O'Donnell on the scene. At the sight of Alley, Mary laughed till she was scarce- ly fit to move. Ailey joined her, as the remembrance of the cause -of their merriment was indeed sufficient to make them enjoy themselves. "Let us hear all about it," insisted Mary's mother. "Here's just what it was, aunt," said Ailey. "Tim Heggarty lost the forfeit, and Barney McAuley was ap- pointed awarder of punishments. He gave out that Tim Heggarty was bound by the laws of the game, and it was ordained there and then, that the said Tim should be carried by the girls from where he then was to the bog-hole at the foot of the meadow, placed in the mid- dle of it right up to the knees in the water, and in which place he was doomed to remain till the girl he loved best should release him from his captivity, by giving him a kiss, without wetting her foot." And fairly overcome with the thought of Tim's ridiculous position, and what followed, Ailey burst forth anew into another fit, hold- ing her sides as if they were like to split. By degrees, Mrs. O'Donnell learned the whole secret of the barn being deserted. No sooner was sentence pro- nounced than half a dozen sturdy girls surrounded the unfortunate Tim. One or two wicked glances at him were enough. He knew not at what point the attack would commence, and just when whirling his arms about him to guard off all and sundry, Tim was lifted off his feet, and fairly hoisted. His gallantry forbade the   The Lost Rosary.        27 expedient of kicking, and away his tormentors hurried him. Arrived at the spot, the difficulty was to get him in, without others incurring a like danger. It was neat- ly managed, however, and Tim was planted right in the middle of the bog-hole. The screams of the girls, and the loud roaring laughter of the boys, was enough to have roused half of the country from its slumbers Tim was in a sad plight. He maintained that a big eel had caught him by the leg. No one went to his rescue. At last, Ailey was literally dragged to the edge to release poor Tim, who begged of her not to keep him standing there all night in the cold. Barney, assisted by two of his companions, held Ailey by the skirt in her attempts to reach Tim. The latter stretched forth his neck till he could stretch it no more. Once or twice, Ailey nearly fell in, and was in momentary danger of dragging the others after her. Finally, the whole party took hands, with Ailey standing on the brink. Thus secured, Ailey stretched herself forward, and when within a few inches of reaching Tim, the chain of hands broke right in the middle, and nearly a dozen fell plump into the water. Tim, in his efforts to save Ailey, forgot all about the eel, and sprang on to terra firma with the girl in his arms. It was then helter-skelter back to the barn, and not one in the lot of them was quicker of foot, or enjoyed the laugh of others equal to poor,-blind Darby. AMary's mother was satisfied. She only hoped that Corny would remain fixed in his belief, and for this pur- pose she hinted something to her daughter and Ailey, which made the young women look at each other quite knowingly. The mother advised them to look sharp about, and geti engaged at work immediately if they wished to keep on good terms with the old man during the day. There was   28      The Lost Rosary. plenty of carded wool at hand, and a pair of spinning wheels lying idle. Nothing pleased Corny like the mu- sic of these wheels, and Mary and Ailey arranged to have a duet in the barn. Of all employments in the country, there are none so hearty and pleasant as that of spinning. Young women can talk and laugh as much as they like while so en- gaged, and the wheel goes faster withal. Young men, too, it has been remarked, conduct their courtship beside the spinning wheel without the slight- est chance of lessening its speed. Mary and Ailey knew all these things quite well; for it must be confessed that they were observant of all the little odds and ends of life as well as the sharpest-sighted among their neigh- bors. Indeed, so clever were they in this respect, that they knew what things to avoid, and knowing them, they did truly and carefully avoid even the semblance of prac- tices too often indulged in to the detriment of those less cautious than themselves. "Come now, girls, look sharp," said Mrs. O'Donnell. And they did look sharp and active, not requiring to be twice told. "Where will we have most room and plenty of quiet- ness?" inquired Mary. "a Where but in the barn?" slyly answered Ailey. To the barn they went. Was it plenty of room, and peace to work, that actuated Ailey? But why ask such a question? It is not necesssary to peer too closely into every little motive,-so let that pass. A couple of hours had nearly passed, and the threads sped quickly through the nimble fingers of the workers. Corny entered the barn, having learned that the girls were busy at work. "That's what I like best of all," cried the old man. "Nothing for me like lots of homespun woollen yarn," he continued.   The Lost Rosary.        29 "Yes, uncle, there is hope for your new stockings yet," cried Ailey. "And a new coat," added Mary. "And blankets for Biddy," cried Corny, quite cheer- fully. "Work away, girls," he said; " nothing like mak- ing hay when the grass --." "When the sun shines, uncle," repeated Ailey. "Aye, when the sun shines;" and Corny left quite pleased-with himself. Entering the house, he commenced in his slow me- thodical fashion to fill the pipe, remarking to Biddy, as he did so: "Them girls deserve an hour's sport, now and again." "To be sure they do, poor things," answered Biddy, looking out of the window at the same time, and behold- ing Barney McAuley and Tim Heggarty enter the barn just as she spoke. "No play, and always spinning," said Corny, " is not the best, at times." "6 All work and no play," replied Biddy. "Aye, that's it," said Corny, " makes the girls dull." "They are well entitled to give a good spell at the work to-day at any rate," said Biddy, knowing well how to humor her lord and master. "Don't be too hard on the poor girls, Biddy ' insisted Corny. "We were once young ourselves, and enjoyed the prospect of a May eve as well as any of them." "True for you, old man; and no later ago than last night didn't we show the young ones a pattern?" "Troth, that we did, Bid." Corny always called his. wife Bid, when he enjoyed the luxury of a good tem- per. '; Still I feel as if it were cruel to ask them youngsters to- sit working all day." "e Oh, never mind them, they would rather be at their employment than idle,"   30       The Lost Rosary. "I suppose it would never do to mention to them what happened last night," inquired Corny. "Not for the life of you ever breathe a word to man or mortial living," said Biddy, most emphatically. "Well, Biddy, I'm a changed man, anyhow." "Changed, to be sure. Aren't we all changed, God help us, when we see an' hear a11 we saw an' heard. But what's the use of a change, Corny dear, unless we stick to it?" "I'm changed," repeated Corny, " an' I mean to stick to the change." Biddy was half incredulous. Her good man was not at all a bad man. He had a surly temper at times, acted and spoke harshy to the poor- occasionally, betrayed a miserable disposition rather often to the great annoy- ance of wife and daughter who wished to always appear decent before the neighbors; but, with the exception of these defects, Corny O'Donnell was very much like other samples of humanity scattered over the world. Either Biddy was doubtful of the strength of his resolu- tion to become a changed man, or, she had experienced resolutions made and broken too often before to attach much weight to the declarations of Corny founded on the fears of the previous night.' Accordingly, we find Biddy, who was only human herself after all, busy at- tending to little jobs of work in her kitchen and sing- ing- "When the devil got sick, The devil a saint would be; But, when the devil got well, The devil a saint was he." If Corny had the temper of a saint, he could not stand that "blasted song." He spoke his mind to Biddy in pretty plain terms, and told her that any shortcomings with which he was afflicted were clearly traceable to her. Corny always retired to his own room whenever tor-   The Lost Rosary. -       31 mented by his " better half," and she, wise woman, often tormented Corny for the very purpose of getting him to perform that act of self-banishment. On the present oc- casion, she was more desirous than ever of assisting her husband to continue in his good resolutions of amend- ment; but the boys were in the barn, and if Corny should learn that fact, there was sure to be a " rumpus." So it "went against her grain," as she said to herself, to be hard on the old man just then; but her desire to allow Mary and Alley, poor things, a minute or two'by them- selves, especially when Barney and Tim "were just ask- ing them how they enjoyed themselves after last night's fun," was the sole cause of her lilting the obnoxious stave. To her astonishment, however, Corny made no appearance ef retreat. He filled his pipe, and went out. Biddy's keen eyes were upon him, but he was uncon- scious of her vigilance. As he approached the barn- door he heard loud laughter, something almost like what he had heard the night before. He stopped a moment, just to think a little, perceiving which, Biddy bawled out, ' Barney"-she intended to call Corny, but had been thinking of several names at the one instant. Barney and Tim both came to the barn-door and looked out. Corny saw them. "What the devil brought these fellows here?" muttered Corny to himself. He entered the barn; Mary and Ailey were spinning away, but the tell- tale blushes were playing hide-and-go-seek on their faces. !"There's hope for my new stockings yet," sneered Cor- ny. There was no reply. "And for my new coat, too," he drawled out, looking towards Mary. "And blankets for Biddy," he added. Neither Barney nor Tim knew anything of what he meant, and consequently were silent. Mary and Ailey kept -spinnirg away, as innocent-looking as the animal whose wool flew swiftly through their fingers   32       The Lost Rosary. "I'll take a smoke with you, Mr. O'Donnell," said Bar- ney. "Better mind your work, and buy tobacco for your- self," answered Corny, making toward the house, and followed by Barney and Tim. "It's not your tobacco, you unneighborly cratur, that I'm wanting," urged Barney, who quietly took a seat un- asked, and spoke to Biddy in the most off-handed man- ner. "Never mind him, Barney," said Biddy. "We were tired from last night, and he has scarcely come round yet. I'm sure he acted very well to you all, so he did ;" and wise Biddy looked approvingly on Corny, in the hope of softening him for what was coming. "There's the pipe," said Corny, " fill it if you like." "Keep your pipe," said Barney. "I came here to-day on a special business, which I wished to conduct in a friendly way; but seeing that there is no possibility of ever finding you in the temper of a Christian, I won't postpone my business on that account any longer." That was the very plan, to attack Corny in such fash- ion. Barney winked -at Biddy, as much as to say, "Didn't I do that well." "An' what is your business, pray?" inquired Corny.- "My business," said Barney McAuley, in a most em- phatic, dramatic, and ecstatic tone of voice, "is--to- make--you-my-father-in-law."' Corny cocked his ear to listen. Some one was sing- ing in the barn. Yes, there it was- "Impudent Barney--'" All was silent again. "Do I understand you," said Corny, puffing away most vigorously at the pipe, " to mean--" "That I want Mary as my wife," said Barney. "Never, till the day of judgment I " cried out Corny most passionately.   The Lost Rosary.        33 "I'll give you till to-morrow to think of it," said Bar- ney, rising to leave. "Mind you," he continued, "I don't want one farthing out of your old stocking-but the girl rI'l have. I have her own consent and her mother's, and if I don't'get yours, I know what I'll do." Saying which, the young men took their departure. Corny sought the retirement of his room, and Biddy went forth to talk to the girls, delighted at the way that Barney had acted.   34       The Lost Rosary. CRAPTER IV. A CONVERSATION AND A PLAN NOT UNDERSTOOD- PRIVATE MOTIVES AND T'1IJl-K CAUSE. a He sat in his chair, all wrinkled with care, And tried to be uncivil; But his heart was as far as yon shining star, From any concern with the devil." NEXT morning, Corny and his wife, Ailey, and Mary, sat down to breakfast. It was a wonderfully quiet per- formance, for some little time. "Bad cess to' it for a May Eve," said Corny, in a sort of half soliloquy. No one appeared to notice the remark, although Cor- ny intended it as an opening to conversation. "A pret- ty time of it I've had indeed," he continued. No one deigned a word in reply. "It's a conspiracy," thought the old fellow to himself. "Do you call that tay?" he said abruptly to his wife. "Yes, Corny darlin', that's tay," replied Biddy. "Don't darlin' me," he said, very -surly; ' I say it's no tay," he continued; " it's weaker than water, and only fit for spoilin' the good milk that's in it." "Uncle, see therel!" cried Ailey, pointing to the win- dow. Corny turned round, and beheld Barney McAuley and Tim Heggarty slowly approaching. "The devil it is I " he exclaimed, as the two young men entered. "A pair of them, an' no less," said Barney, laughing.   The Lost Rosary.       35 "An' how are you, this good morning?" he inquired, holding out one hand to Mary and another to her moth- er. "Troth, we're all purty well, thank you, Mr. McAuley," said the woman of the house. "Mr. McAuley!" repeated Corny. "Aye; an' as good a name as yours, although she did stick the Mister to it," said Barney. "Well, it's better than Heggarty, any day," said Corny, looking closely at Ailey, and in a tone of voice quite changed from his usual style. "Can you sit there quietly, Ailey, an' hear the likes of that?" urged Tim, who sat beside the girl, nudging her with his elbow at the same time. "I would rather have that name any day than McAu- ley," replied Ailey, giving a sly glance at her cousin, and then at Barney. Mary was silent.' She knew that her lover had come that morning to ask her hand, in the presence of her fa- ther and mother. She knew that her cousin and Tim were betrothed, and she did not wish even to appear to treat the matter with levity. Her father knew quite' well, that Barney and his daughter were spoken of as a pair that would " make a nice young married couple." She knew, moreover, that her father, although rough- tempered, was not without a good deal of sound sense; but she dreaded his opposition when Barney would make known his intention of emigrating to America. Barney had told her that he would not- deceive the old couple, under any pretence whatever. He was candid and truth- ful in his nature, upright in character, to any degree; and. by the advice of his cousin Tim, who was his ster- ling friend, he determined to follow this open course. "Mr. O'Donnell, I hope you have changed your mind in that little matter I was spakin' to you about," com- menced Barney.   36       The Lost Rosary. "I don't see any raison to change my mind. Mean- time, I'd prefer to see you both daicently wait for a couple of years yet; and I think you'll be nothin' the worse for it," repeated Corny, in quite a friendly way; and he appealed to Bid:to say if he wasn't right. "It's a thing I don't like to interfere with, farther than for the benefit of all consarned," said Biddy. "The very thing I mane, an' more or less I don't want this good day," said Corny. Barney gave a wink to Ailey and Mary, which both girls comprehended to mean that it was then time for them to retire. "I would have no objection, not in the laste, to abide by every word you have said," replied Barney, when both girls had left; " but, the truth is, Mr. O'Donnell, I'm mak- ing azrrangements to go out to America next month, an' I would like to get married before I go. Cousin Tim here, an' myself, are both of one mind in these matters, an' I believe that Ailey an' himself have their affairs all set- tled." This was hard news for poor Corny. Tears stood in the old man's eyes, and his head shook a good deal as he tried to speak. Biddy was also affected.' Here was news for her; and it was some comfort to Corny to find his wife seated beside him, and comforting him with her sympathetic looks. "To lave me in my ould days,' muttered Corny, "an' not knowin' which of us, her mother, or myself, will be called away first. No, sir; I'll never consent to that," he repeated, firmly. Corny began to think that this notion of emigrating  arose chiefly from the desire of Barney to better his con- dition. Such; however, was not precisely the case. He had a brother living in a distant part of the country, whose eldest son had been guilty of a " dirty trick," and uncle Barney determined not to remain in the country   The Lost Rosary.         37 with the name of McAuley dishonored. The "dirty trick " referred to, was the theft of a heifer. His nephew was tried for the offence, and, by some flaw in the man- agement of .the case, got off. Barney advised the re- moval of the delinquent, but did not succeed, so deter- mined on taking the steps alluded to. Thus Corny was arguing with himself from false premises, never dream- ing that Barney had any other reason for leaving the' country than the very common one of poverty. To some, it may appear strange that one disgraceful act should influence others than the immediate relatives of the guilty person; while some may be found to dis- credit such things altogether. It is notorious, neverthe- less, that among most families in the country districts of Ireland, a single blemish in any member is felt to at- tach to all who belong to that family. In not a few in- stances, especially in the case of females who may have fallen from their high estate of virtue, the memory of the offence is carried down to generations. Such an of- fence as that of giving birth to an illegitimate child- one of the rarest crimes in Ireland-begets a social os- tracism that time will not cure. A dishonest act is sel- dom forgotten by the people, and we often find parties, whose position in life is one of comfort and respectabil- ity, considering it their duty to voluntarily banish them- selves, in consequence of the delinquency of a relative. This was the case with Barney McAuley. His real motive was known only to cousin Tim, who also shared in the feelings that actuated Barney. Was it prudent and wise of Barney to conceal from Corny, and even Mary herself, his real motive for emi- grating? Well, we need not anticipate. Time will tell. "Well, I'll give my consent to your marriage with my child," said Corny, sorrowfully enough; "but only on condition that you banish every thought of separating yourselves from us afterwards."   38       The Lost Rosary. This was a great deal for Corny to accede to, and he felt he had gone at once to the point, and as far as he could or would go. Barney felt himself in " a sort of a quandary," as he afterwards expressed it The old man's offer was fair, and implied a generosity that Barney did not expect. This was the difficulty. He anticipated some reluctance, but foolishy believed that his emigration scheme would further instead of retarding the progress of his' suit. "I'm firmly resolved on goin' to America," resumed Barney. "In fact, I have most of my preparations made for the journey." "I have said all I wish to say on the matter," said Cor- ny, quite cool and collectedly. "An' how about Mary's opinion of these things?" asked her lover. "Mary will be guided by her parents," said the mother, not a little changed in her views by the conduct of Corny. "Will you both be guided by Mary's verdict in the matter?" inquired Tim, who felt in his brave, manly heart for all concerned. "I'm quite prepared," said Barney. Corny and Biddy were both silent. "I think that she is the principal ope to be consulted, after all," insisted Tim. "Well, I'm prepared to abide by her decision," said her father, " provided she knows my mind first, an' be- fore she's asked any questions." Barney was satisfied, and felt conscious of a triumph. Little did poor Mary and Ailey dream of the turn affairs had taken in their absence. Both girls were chaffing each other on the respective merits of Barney McAuley and Tim Heggarty. Ailey and Tim went forth for a walk, and Mary was seated beside her mother. The conversation which had   The Lost Rosary.        39 taken place was rehearsed in the presence of the girl. It was a sad change that had taken place in her feelings. Only a few minutes ago, and she was innocently engaged in pleasant banter with her cousin; now, she was sitting a judge in her own case. Her young heart was torment- ed with a conflict she had never experienced before. She wished earnestly from her heart, that the matter had been decided one way or another, without being called upon to interfere; yet she felt she must take her part, unpleasant though it was, and sliding down on herknees before her father, calmly told him that she would never take such a step of importance without his and her mother's consent. Barney looked upon her with mingled feelings of love and respect. He wished he could retract; and then came the feeling of honorable pride asserting itself to be heard. All were silent for a few minutes, and Tim and Ailey entered. Ailey approached her cousin, and loving- ly raising her, led her into her room. Both girls wept, and found relief in tears. Corny and his wife preserved their silence, and the looks exchanged between Tim and Barney showed how deeply they felt at the result. Tim had guessed rightly how matters had gone. The young men rose and took their leave, both shaking hands warmly with the old couple, and promising to ' look in," in a day or two.   40      The Lost Rosary.   - CHAPTER V. D1b'1'JlENT ViJWS OF DIERENT PARTIES--ONE CAUSE FOR ALL. "The words she said were hard to bear, And hard to her who spoke them; And he had wished he could not hear The spell that thus had woke him." ON their way homeward, Barney felt very much deject- ed. He never contemplated Mary's refusal, even at the risk of offending her parents. "There was more than risk implied," said Tim, very wisely. "There was disobedience," he continued, "an', for my part, if I were you, Barney, Mary's conduct would please me as much, nay, would warm my heart more towards her for her conduct, than if she had acted otherwise." "Oh, it's aisy for you to talk, an' admire conduct in others, when the thing don't concern yourself," said Barney, with not a little sharpness in the tone of his voice. "That's neither fair nor manly, Barney; an' what's worse, you know it. I can excuse you, however, under the circumstances," replied Tim. "I wish to God I hadn't asked her," uttered Barney. "Then it's your pride that's wounded, not your heart." "No, Tim--you're wrong.  It's not my pride that's wounded. I need not deny from myself that filial obe- dience in a girl before marriage is not a bad sign, is it?"   The Lost Rosary.        41 "I'm really glad you take that view of it. Then, what in the name of goodness are you so displeased at? . in- quired Tim, who felt keenly for his cousin's trouble. "I'll tell you what I'm sorry at. Im sorry for the de- ception I practised towards these people.-" "Deception!" cried Tim in amazement. "Why, are you trying to deceive me, too, Barney? What can you mean?" "I'll tell you. Mary had no particular objection to our emigration. She always made our contemplated mar- riage to rest on the leave of her parents. If her father was likely to offer any objection, she rblied on her mother to change his mind. But, neither of us ever looked for- ward to what has happened."  '*But where is the deception in all that?" inquired Tim, eagerly, imagining that his cousin was accusing him- self unnecessarily.  "The deception lay here. I allowed Mary to believe that my sole object in proposing to emigrate was to se- cure our future happiness, as neither of us ever thought that her father had a desire to show us a kindness. Find- ing, then, that he offered no particular objection to our union, but only to our going to America, she would nat- urally think that I should have abandoned that scheme. Do you see now?" "Yes; I begin to comprehend your meaning," an- swered Tim. "Now had I been truthful at the beginning, an' not to hide from her my real motive, the chances are, she would have admired my reasons; but now she misjudges me, an, I have to bear all that without explanation. She will consider my love for her not worth much, when I would not yield in a matter that is intended to benefit us both. ', Tim fully coincided in all his cousin said. He endeav- ored to make him change his mind, but his resolution was fixed.   42       The Lost Rosary. What a simple thing was all this; and yet how impor- tant in its relations on all concerned. "i He is stiff an' stubborn," said Corny to his wife, " an doesn't deserve our girl. I'm sure I never intended -to do so much, an', after all, you see he wouldn't yield, " "I wasn't opposed to their union," said' Biddy, "for Barney is a likely young man, an' I'm far mistaken if a more honorable fellow can be found in the whole of Mag- heramore; but, seeing as how his circumstances were ^ safe here, he might easily have yielded his desire of America." "It will cost that dear girl a hard struggle," continued her father,-" but I think she'll get over it." "Don't make so sure of that," said her mother. "Ma- ry is very wise. She would sacrifice every feeling of her heart rather than do one act contrary to her duty; or, give the example to others of doing anything she knew to be wrong. But she will suffer none the less for all that." The mother was right. She knew her daughter well. Mary O'Donnell could not boast of her large amount of knowledge of this world's ways. She was too good- hearted for that. She would never shine in a brilliant circle; it was even doubtful if she would desire so to shine. She had on one or two occasions seen " a little society," and little as it was, she thought it was enough of the sort for her to see. And yet the great majority of young women--or young ladies, if the reader prefers it- and young men of the world, would like to indulge a good deal in what Mary O'Donnell saw. I am not certain but some old ladies and old men would also like the- same thing. What was it that Miss Mary O'Donnell had seen that people would be so anxious to know all about? Merely a trifle. -But readers shouldn't be trifled with.   The Lost Rosary.         43 Unfortunately, too many are trifled with, and, what is worse, they permit themselves to be trifled with, and their time to be wasted, by the perusal of works that should never have been written, but when written, should never have been read. Mary O'Donnell had the advantage of a boarding school education. She had actually spent three months at such an establishment; and, strangest of all, she re- quested to be removed. A foolish neighboring farmer, named Clarkson, had two daughters at a boarding school in Derry, and their progress was so satisfactory to their father, who was scarcely able to write his name, that he induced Corny to send his girl to the same establishment. Mary was dispatched accordingly, and, at the expiration of the first quarter, hinted pretty plainly that she wouldn't remain. The conductors of that boarding school gave weekly parties, which the scholars relished very much. In fact, it was by this means that the scholars were made to re- main in the place. They all looked forward to what they termed "the beautiful social re-unions," with evi- dent .pleasure. Three days in the week were spent in talking over matters connected therewith; and, at least, the other three were spent in rehearsing the incidents that took place atthem. The young men of the neighbor- hood were invited, and things were made very pleasant. The young ladies dressed themselves, or, rather, undressed themselves, and appeared with shoulders and necks quite bare; their dresses descending still lower at times, until it became doubtful whether they desired to expose their bosoms in toto, or were constantly engaged in the task of attempting to cover them with shreds of scarfs, utter- ly unfit to effect that purpose. The conversation and general conduct of all who participated in " the beautiful socialre-unions," were of such a character that few people used to such things could find fault with. But all such   "       The Lost Rosary. entertainments, it must be remembered, are judged by their general appearance, and not by their results. Mary O'Donnell unwillingly took part in them during her stay at the place; and, being a sharp, observant girl, saw both sides of the little social picture, before and after the en- tertainments. Mary's earliest days were grounded in virtue, both by her mother and by her teachers, at the Old Chapel School of Clonmany. She was thus enabled to discriminate between good and evil; and, although the latter might have been pleasanter to follow, she knew right well the value of after contentment, although it cost a pang or two to cherish virtue for virtue's sake. "Still, I'm inclined to think," said Corny to his wife, "that in a month or two all will be well with her again. The thought of losing her forever would make it all up with me, that's so much certain." The old man was quite right in the knowledge of his own strength. He doated on his child; and mother and daughter knew it, by judging from their own feelings more than by his acts, although the latter were tender enough at times. When Ailey and Mary had sat together for some time indulging in mutual grief, Ailey with her arm around her cousin's neck, and Mary with her head reclining on her cousin's shoulder, both girls rose to go out for a short walk. "I dori't deny," said Ailey, " that Barney McAuley is a young man of rare merit. But I think, after all, cousin Mary, that you will find good cause for thankfulness hereafter, although things don't seem very bright at present." Mary looked up at Ailey, and tried to smile her thanks. There were moments when pleasant banter would have befitted Ailey's tongue and Mary's temper, but it was not just then. "It would be folly in me, dear cousin," said Mary, " to   The Lost Rosary.         45 deny the affection I have for Barney. I know he loves me, and that he would willingly make me his wife, but it is hard to say what changes will come over him soon." "My life on Barney's constancy," said Ailey. "I would scarcely exact so much, seeing that he'll occupy one side of the earth, and me the other," said ary. "I'm not at all certain but he'll be glad to change his mind 'shortly, and give up that notion of America," said Ailey, emphatically, accompanying her words with the least indication of a jerk of the head, which, by means of a free translation, meant plainly enough, " we're just as good as they are, perhaps a trifle better." Mary read the little jerk in a like fashion, and smiled as she comprehended its meaning. "You are wrong, Ailey," she said. "Barney is no way- ward child. I know he has his mind settled on going to America. He would scorn to lead a life of drudgery, and he don't see many openings for bettering his condition here." "But couldn't he wait a couple or three years here, and be young enough to marry, and emigrate for that matter, even then?" insisted Ailey, who desired just then an opportunity of exercising her influence and eloquence on Barney McAuley. "Well, there's some truth in that, I acknowledge," re- plied Mary; " but it is not for me to try to detain him." ' Then I'll try," cried Ailey, joyfully, as the thought crossed her mind that, humble as she was, she might be the means of restoring peace and a proper understand- ing between all parties, even at the eleventh hour. She appeared as if she had some plan of her own, which she did not care to disclose just then.   "      The Lost Rosary. CTrAPTER VI. EN XPLA1ATIO1-  -A GIFT AND AN ADVICE --VOLUX- TARY SACRIFICES. "Thy pilgrimage begins in tears, And ends in bitter doubts and fears, Or dark despair; Midway so many toils appear, That he who lingers longest here Knows most of care." BARNEy made his call according to promise, and when he entered Corny's house was fortunate in finding none present but Mary. She could not avoid wondering at his altered appearance, but made no allusion to it. Per- haps he o]served something of the same in herself. This was exactly the case, but neither guessed what was passing in the mind of the other as sometimes happens under similar circumstances. "I'm glad to see you, Mary," he said, shaking hands with her, and seating himself beside the girl. "I'm glad to see you, too," she replied, without the slightest attempt at concealing her feelings. "Mary," he said, "I want to be very open and above- board with you to-day, an' to learn your mind about our- selves. Do you still abide by your former resolution? I mean your refusal to get married, an' accompany me to America." "You might know  me better, Barney, than ask me such a question," said the girl.   X ne Loss nosary.      4I  "I thought perhaps you might have changed your mind since I saw you." "I'm not stubborn, Barney, at least to you, and if I had any chance of changing my mind, I might have done go, but I have none," she repeated, affectionately, but firmly.  "You mean by that that you still adhere to the will of your father?" he inquired. "I adhere to my duty to the desires of both father and mother," she answered; "C and seeing that it is duty com- pels me, I did think that, as you had nothing so severe as that to contend against, you might have yielded in a matter of taste and convenience to them yourself." a  So I would, willingly, but for one thing." "And what can that be?" she earnestly inquired, as a ray of hope shot across her heart that after all she might be able to settle any difficulty that lay in the way of their union. I'll tell you, on condition that you don't mention it to any one, except Ailey. You may tell her, if you like." "I promise you," said the girl, who was all attention. Barney then gave her a detailed account of his reason for the step he was about to take, adding that his heart was greatly relieved by the opportunity he had of telling ler. "An" now,' he continued, " after all I have said, you see that it is my desire to save you and yours from mny disgrace that would attach to myself, that induces me to again urge you to accompany me." Mary acknowledged that she appreciated his motives )f honor. She did not deny that small as the whole thing was, her father might see in it either an impedi- ment to their marriage, if he knew it previously, or it might become a source of bitterness afterwards. "If mything could endear me to you, Barney, more than leretofore," she said, " it is this proof of your open-heart- Ddness.?   48       The Lost Rosary. He clasped the girl to his breast, and pressed his suit more ardently than ever; while, on the other hand, Mary steadfastly maintained that to leave her parents would be the death of one or other of them; probably both; and if- anything should happen to them, she would always-believe that she was the cause of it; and this, of itself, would ren- der her days miserable ever afterward. Barney could not but acknowledge the force of what she said, and ex- pressed himself satisfied, if Mary promised him to remain constant in her love, and proceed to America to him after' the death of her father. "Your mother," he said, " will not have the same scru- ples as your father; an' if it please God that she lives af- ter him, I'll be to her as dutiful a son as a husband to yourself'                   , ]Mary faithfully promised him that no other would ever t find a place in her affections. She would have said more, but her heart refused its utterance. "The only thing I care to leave you, is this," he said; and he took from a breast-pocket a neat little Rosary, which Mary had seen and admired before. "It is the dearest thing to me on earth," he added; " the dying gift of my mother, an' the greatest treasure I ever possessed." Mary took the present, and pressed it to her lips, prom- ising again most faithfully to remain " constant and true to her first, her only love." "After all, Mary," continued her lover, " the prospect of working for a dear object will not be wanting in my case, an' I shall endeavor to keep that before my eyes, both as an incentive an' as a guard against evil courses." "These were the thoughts nearest to my heart," said Mary. "I felt some difficulty in expressing them; but now that you have, as it were, opened the way, Barney, for me to speak, I beseech of you, when far away from me, and from all your old friends and- acquaintances, never, even for a moment, forget the straight and honors 1.   The Lost Rosary.        49 able path you followed here. Something tells me that there is little danger of any change in you." "Your advice will be always present to me," replied the young man; 1" an' as we don't know what a strange country, strange companions, strange customs, strange everything, may effect in any of us, there is nothing like being fortified against even the chance of evil, by the good counsel of those we love." "Your words give me great hope," said Mary. "They renew within me feelings that I have been trying to ban- ish since the hour I saw it necessary, Barney, to act as I did." Ailey entered, and expressed how glad she was to see Barney. No one who had witnessed the pair at their last meeting, would have thought it even likely that in so short a time they would have had the reconciled ap- pearance which Mary and Barney then presented. "By-the-by, Ailey, I should have told you that Tim promised to call this way on his return from farmer Clarkson's." Just then Tim entered, with the salutation, "spake o' the deil, an' he'll appear." "Was there a race between you an' Ailey, as to which would be in first?" inquired Mary, addressing Tim, and placing a seat for him. "I saw her in advance of me coming down the road, and ran to overtake her," said Tim; " but she hurried on, not knowing, I'm sure, that her own bould Tim was so near hand." "What if I did know, and just hurried on with my- self, for fear of you overtaking me," said Ailey, with a little coquettish air. "Not a bit of you knew I was behind you," said Tim, "or you would have taken your time,--just till I would have got my arm round your waist, in this fashion," said Tim, suiting the action to the word. 4   50        The Lost Rosary. "Hands off with you, till you account for your visit to them Clarksons," said Alley, removing her seat some dis- tance from Tim's. Alley and Tim were delighted with the happy-looking appearance of Mary and Barney, and were glad to get bantering one another. ' You've early begun to be jealous," said Tim to Ailey. "Signs on it, I should be," she said, " when I find you hanging up your cap in that quarter." "They are two fine girls, them daughters of old Clark- son, Miss Jenny and Miss Nelly, an' I'm sure---" "That they would just be the very ones to suit the likes of you," said Ailey, Tnaking for the door, and pur- sued by Tim. Once outside, these young people walked arm-in-arm for a short distance. "Has Mary consented to accompany Barney, do you think, Ailey?" inquired Tim. "I'm afraid not," she said; "I might as well say, I'm sure she hasn't." "Well, they look thoroughly reconciled, at any rate," said Tim; " an' troth that's a comfort, I can assure you; for poor Barney was- nearly broken-hearted." And so was Mary herself, poor girl," added Alley, sympathetically. "I suppose," she continued, " there would be little use trying to get Barney to forego his in- tentions."7  "No use whatever," said Tim, " an' I'm almost certain that you'll learn the cause from Mary herself, before to- morrow; at least, Barney told me he would explain his reasons fully to her, giving leave at the same time to tell them to you." Ailey was downcast. Her little plan was defeated. If Barney had reasons which would urge him to go to America, she might not hope to make him change his mind. This, however, was not the cause of her dejec-   The Lost Rosary.        51 tion; but she had hoped to make her own plans-which she determined to put into execution whenever she saw Tim-a means to procure a change in those of Barney.. Tim offered the girl a sum of money to make prepa- rations for the day that was to make him the happiest man in Donegal. Alley seemed in no hurry to accept that mark of Tim's goodness, which the young man in- terpreted to mean a delicacy on her part to accept a money gift. "You need have no scruple, dear Alley, in making use of this small sum," said Tim. "Any reluctance to take it, and spend it, would make me believe that you objected to it on account of its value; but I assure you----" "There now, that'll do," cried Ailey. "I know that what you say is only a trick to make your kindness easi- ly accepted. But it's not that, Tim, that troubles me." And the color came and went on Ailey's cheek as she es- sayed to continue the conversation. Tim half suspected, by her appearance, what was coming. "You know, dear Tim," she said, slowly, and the words were like to choke her, " after what has happened between Mary and Barney it would ill become me, who owes so much to my cousin, and to uncle and aunt, to even seriously think of mar- riage at the present. They would all-aye, every one of them-think that my example would have a bad effect on Mary's mind; and it is better, all things considered, to postpone our wedding till we see how matters stand hereafter." "An' that means, I suppose, that you give up the idea, also, of going to America?" inquired Tim. "For the present, yes," answered Ailey. "Very well," he said, quite composedly. "Perhaps it's all for the best." Tim was satisfied, and did not push the matter further. They both returned.

"Build me straight, O worthy Master, Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel, That shall laugh at all disaster, And with wave and whirlwind wrestle." ON the first of June, 1845, the good ship "St. Patrick" sailed from Liverpool for New York, with a human car- go of six hundred souls. On board this ship were Ber- nard McAuley and Timothy Heggarty-two young men who "kept themselves by themselves, " as an old Irish woman remarked. There were also from the same place, Farmer Clarkson, his wife, and Jenny and Nelly Clarkson. What a strange assemblage of people were gathered together in the steerage of that ship. The large major- ity of the passengers were Irish, and of these there was every description of every class of people, old and young, good and bad; some comfortable, others poor; some with cash in their possession, others without a penny; some well provisioned, others without a bite to eat other than the ship's allowance; some, and they were the fewest number, with some prospects before them on landing; others going out on speculation, ready to face and to dare hardships of any kind, rather than submit to those at home, without even a chance throughout life to better their miserable condition. As a rule, all were light- hearted. They had passed the bitter ordeal of leave- taking with friends and relations; they had looked for   54       The Lost Rosary. the last time on the graves of parents and children, gazed tenderly and affectionately on the weli-remembered spots of their childhood, with feelings which no pen has ever yet -or ever shall be able to describe. Some had left fathers and mothers, and sisters and brothers; some had left wives and young families, dependent on the mercies of a cold and callous world, who sustained themselves with the thought that, with God's help, be- fore long, they would be able to send the first remit- tance to cheer the desolate homes they had left forever. Others again were there, whose families were indirectly the cause of their expatriation. Parents, whose want of forethought and foolish notions about their children, had permitted themselves to be wrecked in the middle pas- sage of life, relying solely on the strength of the ship's hull, rather than on the proper management of the ship's sails, that were carrying them and theirs over life's billows. That ship, the "St. Patrick," was a miniature of the world's life. Two passions were predominant in the minds of the emigrants: pure and unalloyed love;, open and undisguised hatred. How  strange that such men- tal antitheses could live and flourish at the same time in one human breast. Both passions were absorbing, and yet they were co-existent. Love asserted its supremacy and filled their whole being. Hatred, the opposite, most antagonistic and repugnant to love, was welcomed and fostered with as much assiduity as love itself. There are lessons here for the statesman, if he will con- descend to learn them at such an humble source. These lessons are worth a world full of statistics, for they pre- cede them, and are the cause, the other being but the effect. This hatred extended to those who were the au- thors of the desolation that afflicted the people who were driven from their homes. The spirit of religion battled strongly for possession of the minds of those so afflicted,   The Lost Rosary.        55 and whatever result followed, was the change of hatred from persons to principles of government. The love owed much of its intensity to the hatred that we speak of, for the sufferings of those left behind induce I the one and helped the other. It was a matter of considerable consolation to those, of the passengers, who knew it, to find that two young clergymen had taken passage in the same ship. These were young missionary priests braving dangers early in life, so as to follow their own people, driven forth by the cruelties of landlord tyranny to seek the means of liv- ing far away from the spots they loved dearest of all on earth. These clergymen were but lately ordained, and as they walked the quarter-deck arm-in-arm, engaged in lively conversation, not a few unhappy hearts took cour- age, and felt their desolation of spirit disappear. "God bless them, for two fine young cratures," said an old woman to a crony beside her. a "Amen!" replied the other. "It's tihe aisy conscience they have, dear, as ye can see by the music o' their laugh." "Wasn't- God good to us wid the luck that brought them on board?" continued the first speaker. s"Musha, then, true for ye; but, sure, it's just when we don't desarve a single blessin', that heaven sends them in pairs," "D'ye hear that, Barney?" asked Tim. "The ould Faith is strong, even on the ocean." "Do you know the old woman?" inquired Barney. "Which of them?" "The one who spoke last." "Not I. How should I know her?" "I do," said Barney, approaching the pair of old peo- ple, who were seated on an old barrel, and partly remov- ed from the general throng who crowded the deck, for the day was warm and fine.   56       The Lost Rosary. "If Moll Hanley isn't dead, I see her sitting croning there this blessed day," said Barney, holding out his hand to the old woman whom he addressed. "Musha, then, heaven be praised, it's yourself that's here, Barney McAuley, when I didn't expect to see a friend or neighbor before landin' in Ameriky." "Faith it's just myself, an' heartily glad I am to see you, Moll. But how on earth did it happen that I never saw you till this minute?" "Och, dear, sure it was the sickness kept me down be- low; an' wasn't I just as good as dead, but for the kind- ness of this good-hearted woman here, Mrs. McGlone, who never left me a minute by myself." Tim was listening to the conversation, and whenever he heard the name of McGlone mentioned, he stood clos- er to the old woman, and in a few minutes was recogniz- ed by that person. Tim was rejoiced that Barney had found an acquaint- ance; while Mrs. McGlone was the same to find that Moll Hanley had her heart cheered in like manner. It was Barney's time now to wonder at Tim, and Moll's to express her astonishmnent at Mrs. McGlone's good luck. "Is there never a bit o' tobacey in the company?" in- quired Moll, " that we may have the pleasure of a smoke and a. chat together." "Troth Where is," replied Barney; "I've lots of it, an' mayn't we use it up as much as we like, for there's. plenty I'm tould in the land we're goin' to, of the same tobaccy."  ".iot exactly the same," said Mrs. McGlone; "but there's plenty, as you say, an' a great deal better than any you were used to at home."   \ I was about to say, that it was a pity that two such-fine old Irish women were addicted to the use of the tobacco- pipe occasionally, but, on second consideration, deem it   The Lost Rosary.        57 better to leave the reader to his own opinions as to whether it was or was not a pity. A smoke of the pipe, even in an old woman, is just as harmless as in an old man; and it is not the first time that I have observed a great deal of virtue among these same old folk-aye, vir- tue and knowledge combined, that, when thoroughly ex- amined, would make many of us ashamed. So we will allow them to smoke away, and enjoy the fragrance of the weed, with a taste of something else, discovered in a corner of the trunk of the expert Tim, who knew the ex- act spot where to put his hand on it, while we listen to a few remarks of the Clarksons. Jenny and Nelly Clarkson were both fine-looking girls, and had attracted a good deal of attention from the mo- ment they came on board. The majority of the young girls around them were quiet and reserved in their man- ners, seldom speaking in a tone louder than a whisper, while many of them were buried in grief. Not a few of them envied Jenny and Nelly Clarkson for being so light- hearted. which arose no doubt from the fact of their be- ing accompanied by both father and mother. So they thought. These girls would, in all probability, have been lighter hearted still, but for the restraint of their father at least; the mother was to them of very small account, although they were far from letting that be known. The father was rather weak-minded in permitting himself to have been ruled by his wife, who was many years his junior; but such was the case, and the result was, there they were that daybound for a new land, when they might have been enjoying the sweets and comforts of their own country home. But DMrs. Clarkson looked upon her daughters as rare and gifted girls, who would, in all prob- ability, have been mated to some ignorant clodhoppers at home, if they had been stupid enough to remain in the old country. Her girls required a little license occasion-   58       The Lost Rosary. ally. They were fit "to appear in society," and why bury herself and them in obscurity merely to please the erratic temper of their father, -who knew little-and it might have been added, cared less-about what was due to young ladies? She did often wish that her lot had been cast otherwise than it was; however, that was past remedying now; and there was nothing for it but to bear with "her troubles" on account of her darling girls. Thus reasoned Mrs. Clarkson, who naturally -enough thought something of herself, and was vain enough, al- though the mother of two young women, to seek for the smiles of some of the male passengers, and return the compliment whenever paid her. She knew both Tim and Barney; had heard something of them, and, as they were " good-looking young fellows," would have permit- ted them to address her daughters if they felt so inclined. Their inclinations did not make them so disposed. She would willingly have accorded them that liberty onboard the vessel, as a means of attracting the attention of others; but she laughed when she thought of the differ- ence between an acquaintance under such circumstances and when settled down in America. Neither Barney nor Tim were edified by any knowl- edge of the attention thus paid them by Mrs. Clarkson. They were stupid enough to relish the conversation of old Moll and Mrs. McGlone, and to exhibit by theirhearty laughter the interest they felt in said conversation. "Did you ever hear the like?" remarked Jenny Clark- son to her sister, as the laughter reached their ears. "Och, bless you, what do they know, poor ignorant fellows?" replied sister Nelly. "And what a pair of old crones they have taken up with, to be sure." "Good enough for them, I should think," remarked the mother. "I wonder," continued that exemplary personage and proof against sea-sickness-all such women are proof   The Lost Rosary.         59 against the like; account for it, physiologists, if you can--" how that affair was broken off between them, and the two cousins--what's this you call them?" "Mary and Ailey O'Donnell," replied Jenny. "Yes, to be sure," replied her mother, "I did hear some one say that old Corny, Mary's father, wouldn't listen to any proposal of marriage,--while her mother was just dying to see the pair together." "Oh, what matter," replied Nelly Clarkson, " the bit was as good as the sup, I presume." "I hope none of them will bother us; but see, as true as death, there's father speaking to them," uttered Jen- ny, quite hurriedly. Farmer Clarkson had often spoken to the young men since he came on board, but none of the family were aware of that most extraordinary act, it would appear. Terrible things do happen at times, even at sea. Moving along with the farmer, Barney and Tim ap- proached the sisters and mother, and inquired how they were getting on,-did they like the voyage, and were they comfortable? It was a trial of speed among the three, as to who would be the first to speak. They answered the inqui- ries, and hoped the young men were comfortably situat- ed in their part of the ship. After half an hour's rapid and pleasant conversation the party separated: the young ladies, and their mother, too, for that part of it, expressing themselves in a man- ner quite different from their former remarks. In fact, they were all three blessed with convenient memories, and speedily forgot what they had said, even to each other.   60       The Lost Rosary. CHAPTER V1l. A STORM AT SEA--REFLECTIONS THKpRtO0W. "Then fell her straining1 topmasts, Hanging tangled in the shrouds; And her sails were loosened and lifted, And blown away like clouds." FOURTEEN days at sea, and everything had gone well. Every lonely heart was beginning to raise itself. The passengers had nearly all become acquainted, one with the other, and song and dance, and jest enlivened the monotony of ship life. The heart-wrung pangs of sep- aration were, if not forgotten, fast yielding to the gentle wooings of inspiring Hope. The merry laugh, with its silvery tones, displaced the smothered moan. The rosy cheeks of youthful maidens, so long bedewed with tears of sorrow, now beamed in all their guileless beauty, showing the gladness that reigned within, and tinged their thoughts with the light of a happy future. The moon rose from the ocean depths, like a globe of fire. The dull red beams she sent athwart the waste of waters, showed the rising billows of the sea, cold and angry looking, and sending forth a deadened hollow murmur. A few clouds sped quickly overhead, followed by a sharp and broken whistling of the wind. The rig- 3ing of the ship began to creak uneasily, and a weird- like music played among the shrouds. The glass gave indications of unsettled weather, and the ship rolled un- easily. In a little she began to heave, and rose and fell   The Lost Rosary.        61 in obedience to the whitening waves on which she rode. Suddenly a sea dashed across her bows, and the noble craft staggered with the force of the blow. That was the indication of a storm which the skipper had foreseen for hours before, and did his best to guard against. The passengers had gone below, but 'were soon awak- ened by the unusual motion of the vessel. . They looked uneasily at one another, and not a few were flung back into the full horror of the sickness they had but lately passed. In a couple of hours the storm had fairly broken over the gallant bark. At one moment she was lifted by a giant wave, to be plunged in the next down, down in- to the gulf below. Anon, she lay on her beam ends, as if unable to right herself again. It was during these struggles the people suffered most. They held their breath in painful suspense, and a dead silence prevailed, save when some exclamation reached the ear, such as, O0 God, we're lost I " and the stoutest heart quailed at the despairing tone of the sufferer. "Double reef every inch of sail," shouted the skipper, overhead, " and keep her head close to the wind-mind, there!" "Aye, aye, sir," was the response; but the voices seemed to proceed from treble their distance. "Fasten down the hatchways." "They're down, sir," was the reply. Yes! they were nailed down; there was no alternative on that dreadful night. It was death without, and death within. The storm raged with ruthless fury, and the' bright hopes experienced only a few hours pre- vious, blended with the sunshine of promise, were driven back upon the heart, black and despairing. The berths of the ship became stifling with an imprisoned mias- ma,-while seas washed overhead, and swept the deck of every movable article. Louder and fiercer, was the war of the elements;   62       The Lost Rosary. crash followed crash, as the stout ship tried, like a thing of life, to face the power that beset her. A moment, and every timber strained and shook, like the nerves of a full-blooded steed, suddenly reigned in by the hands of its rider. "Heavens! did you feel that shiver?" asked Barney of his companion. "Feel it, aye; who could miss feeling it," replied Tim. A report, like the boom of a cannon, was heard over- head,-then another-and another! "God an' His blessed Mother presarve us," exclaimed poor Moll Hanley, " what is that?" Then there arose a long and piteous wail among the females, old and young. They had tried to suppress their fears, but the awful noises overhead seemed created to banish hope from their. hearts . The mainsail was rent in a thousand pieces, and the mast that gallantly bore it was snapped in twain, as if a cannon ball had struck it. The ship lay on her side, dis- abled, and as if frightened to rise from the trough of the sea. Every hand was at work to clear away the wreck, and these indications of life formed the only con- solation to those distressed hearts below. Hundreds of young women were engaged in what they believed were the last prayers they would ever offer to God in this life; others were speechless with silent horror; while the strong beatings of many hearts proved the terror of the men. Hour after hour passed away. It seemed the reflex of eternity. Not a few were pitched here and there through- out the compartments allotted them,-while others, again, overcome by the sickness engendered by foul air, lay stretched like corpses on the floor. How like to the voyage of life was that passage of the "St. Patrick 1"Its first days out, were the spring of life- everything happy and cheerful; then came the summer-   The Lost Rosary.        63 joyous and short-lived; and the winter, with its storms and wrecks, sufferings and privations, fears and tribula- lations. But not a soul was lost I And there was a com- munion of prayer, too, in the noble ship, unknown, for the most part, to those who participated in it, and joined in by those thousands of miles removed I So it is with those who have the happiness of being born in the Catholic Church: storms and tempests as- sail her children; the blackness of despair surrounds the tortured soul, and destruction seems inevitable. Bear up, brave soul, thou art overwhelmed with dark- ness and suffering, but prayers ascend in thy behalf. See! a light beaming in the young EastS-fresh and holy as the first dawn in Eden. The goodly mast is gone, that bore thee gallantly through the storm, but Heaven has still a smile for thee. The first soft streaks of day are blushing at the work of night. The storm is passed, and gladdened hearts are busy repairing the good ship's loss. Profound thankfulness now stirs the souls of all who were endangered. No purer, holier offering ever ascend- ed to God, than the humble tribute of those lonely girls, those pure daughters of Erin, who had risked the storms of the sea, and those of the world, to prove their devoted affection to those who had cared for them when unable to care for themselves. Storms and trials you will meet, brave hearts,-but re- member your night of storms upon the sea. Tempta- tions will surround you; sin will encompass you; aye, as the dark waters surround you now. Then remember your only hope. Call back the Faith that saved you when Hope was trembling at your hearts. That will be your anchor, brave Irish girls, when alone and battling against every storm. Cling to it, like the tempest-tossed mariner who feels his heart grow stout and warm with- in him, as he gazes on the anchor of his ship.

Thy virgin modesty will be shock- ed, and thy ears assailed betimes with language un- known to thee before. Fear not. Vice will cunningly allure you, with its deformities hidden beneath the garb of wealth. Be on thy guard. Soft words and honeyed speech will rain upon thy hearing, in order to reach the purity of thy hearts to destruction. Be as those who are deaf. Foul words and practices will cross thy paths; curses will fall around thee, but remember the waves against the sides of the ship. If thy souls be troubled, remember the roseate dawn that followed the Night of Storms:! Be true to the old father, and the old mother. Let th9 music of their voices be always in your ears, to guide and guard you. lPemember their gray hairs, and their faltering voice. Mind the Old Chapel and its hum- ble Cross. Think often of the hours you spent within its walls; of the evenings spent at the "four roads," Think of the old hearthstone, and the bush before the door of the cabin. But, before and above all, think of God! . . .- . . Be cheerful, too; enjoy life hearti- ly and well. Let thy temper be as sweet as the dews of May. Laugh till you're tired; work with a will; get married; but mind--aye, there's the rub, girls-- mind the choice. Never let your hands be sullied by a RING THAT THE CHURCH CA NNOT BLESS. Your own, and the salvation of others, aye, of generations, depend on that one act of your lives. Choose poverty, rather than run the risk of marriage with one that professes not your faith. You need not wait to examine the advice here tendered. It admits of no examination. Under any cir- cumstances, a mixed marriage is an unmixed evil. The trials and cares of life are numerous enough, under the best circumstances. Add not to these the never-ending strife of union with one who differs from you in religion. Not even if your intended partner be of easy mind, and careless of his own belief. This often aggravates such   The Lost Rosary.        65 unions, for indifference in one partner often begets the same in the other. Above all, a mixed marriage in America, where you will be removed from the holy in- fluences of home, and the care of those who are dear to you, and you to them, is worse, a thousand-fold, than un- der other circumstances. Fly the very thought of such unions, as you would the vilest snare. Heed not the ex- ample of others, whose pride and passion lead them to look on such things as quite common, and of no conse- quence. Beware even of associating with those who might lead you into such a state. af   "       The Lost Rosary.

Who, through death, have unto God ascended  Ye have arisen From the cares that keep us still in prison." Fjv En had broken out in the ship, but fortunately not till she had nearly made the passage. Farmer Clark- son was among the first stricken down. His wife ap- peared attentive, but the only real attention paid to the poor man was given by Barney and Tim. His daughters seldom approached him, but they proved their devotion to their sick parent by a good deal of crying and lamen- tation. Theywere very distressed in mind, but they were so frightened of feverI Strange that strangers were not so frightened I Barney and Tim were almost constant in their atten- tions to the poor sufferer. Even during the night they sat in turns by his bedside, rministering to his wants with a devotion, under the circumstances, almost heroic. Only a few days after the farmer had been stricken down, the joyful word "land" was heard toiresound throughout the ship. That word passed like electricity through a multitude of hearts, but the poor farmer heeded it not, or, if he did, could not join in the general happiness of the other voyagers.

"In  t nam e of goodnss, then, what is it?" Barney then rehearsed to T im, that before he    68       Twhe Lost Rosary. minutes beside old Clarkson, he turned toward him and asked him for a drink. He was very weak, and not fit to speakscarcely. He asked Barney if he was afraid to stoop over to him, and keep his ear near to his mouth as he wished to have a talk with him. Barney replied that, with the help of God, he was not in the least afraid of anything. Old Clarkson then slowly rehearsed to him the leading incidents of his married life. His wife was a Protestant, and he was a Catholic. For the first four years he had everything his own way. His wife was baptized, so were his children. This much he in- sisted upon having performed, and he regretted it, i his wife's case, ever afterward. He thought that his own good example would, in time, make her sincerely at- goodexapedly et in,7  a  cedro  butn he good,  ouatcl tached to the faith she had embraced, but he found out his mistake when too late.

He got down-hearted and careless, thus giving his wife full power over his daughters. She ruledhim, and gave them their will in all things. e saw the dan- ger, but neither tried nor cared to prevent it. Indiffer- ence speedily set in, and, from being a good, practical Catholic, he became both ashamed and afraid of acknowl- edging himself as such. Now he was stricken by the hand of Go4t-stretched, as he believed, on his bed of death, withoute the slightest aid or chance of saving his unfortunate soul. Barney comforted the old man, and told him, if he de- sired it, that even then and there he might obtain the services of a priest. The poor mal looked wildly about him, and inquired if Barney was mocking hid Whenhe leamed thbat there was a possibility of having a Catholic clergyman beside him, the tears streamed down his cheeks. Shortly afterwards, Barney proceeded to search for the berths of the two young priests whom he had   The Lost Rosary.        69 seen walking the quarter-deck.  For some time he was unsuccessful, and he received more opposition than as- sistance from the person in charge of the cabin, who insisted there were no clergymen on board. It must have been the noise of voices in altercation that awoke some of the passengers; for, no sooner were thewords " priests"- and " clergymen " so distinctly pronounced, than one of those alluded to instantly arose, and ap- peared on the scene to learn what was the matter. Bar- ney took the gentleman aside, and promptly informed him of the state of matters with old Clarkson. The cap- tain and doctor of the ship were very anxious to keep the matter dark, that a fever patient was on board; but Barney considered it right to make the young priest ac- quainted with the fact beforehand. The priest thanked Barney for his kindness to the poor man, and a few minutes afterward saw him beside the sick bed, minis- tering comfort, consolation and relief to him. The cler- gyman saw and spoke to Barney, after his lengthened interview with Clarkson, and told himi he had acted very properly and wisely in what he did, adding- ' But there's no use, Tim, tellin' what he said about myself." "To be sure, there's every use," urged Tim. "Well, then," added Barney, " he said there was lots of luck in store for me; to keep always prepared and ready to do a good action for another, an' there was no fear of me, here or hereafter." Tim was glad to hear all he had heard, and both pro- ceeded to see how their patient was getting on. He ap- peared better, tut paler. He smiled when he saw his two friends, and shook hands with them. He turned on his side, as if desirous of keeping quiet, and Barney and Tim quietly withdrew. "He won't long be a trouble to any one," remarked Barney. I    70       The Lost Rosary. "I think we should inform his wife an' family,9 said Tim. "I know it would be right to do so, if they were the right sort of people; but, in my opinion, it might do him no good." ' If they were the right sort of people, it's not to the care of strangers they would haveleft him," Tim bitterly repeated. Had these two generous-hearted young men only known it, they might have saved themselves any talk on the matter. Poor Clarkson's soul was in the presence of God! He felt from the first that the hand of death was on him, and the bitter reflections that he should die in an emigrant ship, and without the least chance of being comforted in his last hours by the sacraments he had so long neg- lected, caused him many a pang. It never entered his mind that, by any possibility, a priest could be on board, and the intelligence by Barney McAuley nearly upset him. He thought he perceived in this fact, the last and crowning mercy of God. The conflict of his tortured mind, in looking back upon the past, now that his end was so near, and the intelligence conveyed to him by Barney, caused a wonderful change in the old man. That change continued, and after the priest left him, with his blessings still warm upon his head, the poor sufferer experienced a peace he never experienced before. His time was short, but not too short for Him who knowetlh not time, and while continuing in the act of returning thanks to God, poor Clarkson breathed his last WITHlN SIGHT OF LAND! When it became known that Farmer Clarkson was dead, his wife and daughters gave full vent to their grief. It may appear hard- to judge them thus, but it did seem as if they desired to show to others their tenderness of heart, rather than indulge in silent grief.   The Lost Rosary.         71 The captain, without being asked, kindly permitted the corpse to remain where it was, without hurting the feelings of the distressed family, by consigning it to a watery grave. He did this as he was so near to port, and in order to afford the privilege of decent burial to the deceased. Tim Heggarty maintained afterwards, that he believed that the captain did that in order to punish Mrs. Clark- son with the expense of burying her husband. It may have been an uncharitable thought of Tim's, but he ad- hered to it nevertheless, and thought he had good grounds for his suspicion. At length, the order was given to let go the anchor, and now all was bustle and turmoil, preparing for dis- embarkation. There was the noble ship, weather-beaten, partly dis- masted, and bearing all the signs of a stiff and hazard- ous voyage. Arrived in port, it bore the appearance of a thing of life with the marks of the struggles it had passed through. It seemed as if proud of its own con- duct, as the Stars and Stripes were run aloft. It felt a victory had been won, just like a soldier who has passed through the carnage of the battle-field. Its cuts and scars were its honors, not to be hidden, but to feel proud of, indeed.

CHAPTER X. MOLL HANLEY'S ADVICE TO THE YOUNG GrILS -BA- 1NY AND TIM FALL IN W'ITH N IlW FBRIKN DS - ALICE AND MRS. M'SWEENEY. "Good girls! - poor things now far from home, Who crossed the ocean's darkling foam; There's many a way of sin and shame - And many a way of peace and fame." ALL are now landed, and the majority are engaged in seeking work, Barney and Tim among the rest. There are at least one hundred and twenty poor and desolate girls, whose ages average fromn eighteen or twenty, to thirty-five. Thle large majority are;all young. Moll Hanley and Mrs. McGlone are giving their part ing advice to those whose acquaintance they made on board.  ( Mind now, girls," said Moll, in the presence of some -strangers who were present, and who had the appearance of employers on the look-out for hands; "keep your eyes open. You're just as sharp an' as- smart as the best you'll serve. You needn't be a bit impudent, nor you needn't be abit cast down or afraid. If anyone injures you, ye have the laws that'll protect ye; not all as one as the place we all know (this was evidently an allusion to Ireland, although Moll did not like to implicate her own country with the mal-administration of English law), an' hould up your heads, not above your shupayriors, but above a dirty action," and Moll looked as if she were the r:f .nJnn p Ha V Ado An "A Cnanin   The Lost Rosary.        73 "Mind everything Mrs.} McGlone tould you," contin- ued Moll; "she knows more nor I, for she's been to Ameriky before, an' you may rely on her advice, an' nev- er forget the ould faith nor the ould shamrock, God bless both o' them." "Amen!" was the reply to Moll's last words. It was pleasing to observe the confidence this poor woman's words raised in those whom she addressed. "Well done, Moll- Hanley," said Barney, approaching her with extended hand. "Are you goin' to remain in New York, or do you travel farther into the country?" "Both of us," replied Moll, speaking for herself and companion, " will remain in New York City, an' if we can get a place, troth it's a good lodgin' house we intend to start, where neither son nor daughter of the ould country will ever have cause to complain." "By this an' by that," said Tim, " but if that's your in- tention we'll both be customers, if we remain in this place." Barney followed suit, and, after getting an address from Mrs. McGlone, where she or Moll might be found at any time previous to their starting business on their own account, they all took leave of each other, Barney direct- ing his steps to a friend's house, where he expected that a letter from Mary would be waiting for him, and proba- bly one from Ailey for Tim. The house to which our friends Barney and Tim di- rected their steps, was the humble but comfortable home of Alick McSweeney, a distant relation of Barney, who had left Ireland many years ago, and was then a married man, with a fine young rising family. The meeting between the friends was hearty and agreeable, and repaid, at least to some extent, the trials and sufferings of Barney and Tim. Alick's wife was a woman of very considerable intelligence, and showed her worth by the admirable manner in which she seconded   74       The Lost Rosary. her husband's efforts to get on in the world. She had left Ireland when a mere child; both her parents died shortly after they had landed in America, and she was left completely at the mercy of the world. She engaged at service, and, by minding her own business instead of minding the business of others, she succeeded well; and when Alick McSweeney first saw her, she was the posses- sor of more dollars than her intended husband. "That's as true as I'm living," said Alick, addressing Barney and Tim in presence of his wife. "But it's also true," said Mrs. McSweeney, "that you never dreamed of my having so much as a penny at the time you came gallivanting after me, and hurrying me to get married." "Now, do you hear that," replied her husband, with a knowing wink; "sure it's because I knew you were hiding your money and all your good qualities from my sight, that I was so fond of you." "Sorra bit of it, Alick," laughingly replied his partner; and if it hadn't been that you never inquired if I had anything of the kind, I wouldn't have given you the least encouragement, that I wouldn't, and right well you know it." "Right again, old girl," said Alick, slapping his wife familiarly and affectionately on the shoulder. "Such thoughts never crossed my mind. I just said to myself, well, if that girl has served strangers so well, and passed through New York life so scathlessly, by my dickens but she ought to be able to undertake the duties of a good and faithful wife to an honest fellow like my- self." "There he goes, now; only hear him, and you would think that nobody in all the world was as good as him- self." "And my wife along with me, for aren't we two in one," added Alick.   The Lost Rosary.,       75 "Tim, I think that you an' I will have to look sharply about us, if we wish to overtake Sick in the race," said Barney. "He has got too much of a start of us," replied Tim; "an' then look at the help he got." "Just look out for the same help," said Alick; " but be as wise as I was, and don't take the book by the cover." ; Who ever heard the like?" asked Mrs. McSweeney. ;' You would just think -- ' ' That you were a duck of a good wife," said her hus- band, drawing his seat closer to hers. "There she sits, Barney," he continued, " and there's not a girl in all America came through more nor she did. She had to face the strangers, when only a little girl. Temptations stood open pretty wide before her. Sometimes she had a good place, but oftener a bad one. The good places were those where, somehow, she never could remain long. She was laughed at, jeered, and jibed for a poor idola- trous thing, that it were a blessing to take care of against her will. She was a stinking piece of dried up goods if she refused to accompany other girls in their evening rambles; and many a hard, bitter hour she had of it, among her fellow servants, if her work was better done or earlier finished, because she deprived herself of use- less idling. At other times, I have known her tobe E   struck on the mouth, for being five minutes behind her time, when she was hurrying home through blinding sleet, after spending an hour in church, and that hour she might have spent in some low dancing saloon, if she had so pleased." Barney and Tim wished to be informed on the matter of dancing saloons, and were somewhat surprised on learning their nature and character. "There are few people who come to America," said Mrs. McSweeney, " especially those of my own kind, but   u       bine JLiost Rosary. can learn as much evil as good, if they are so inclined." Both Tim and Barney listened attentively. "The great difficulty," added Alick's wife, " that young girls meet with here on their arrival, is their utter ina- bility to know those parties who surround them and ad- vise them how to act The poorinexperienced girl, who has no friend here before her, often finds herself in a sad plight. Low lodging-houses are the only places, as a rule that such poor girls can go to, and, dear onlyknows, they too often find themselves exposed in those veryplaces to their first hard trials. They are oftentimes discouraged from making proper applications for work, so that they may remain longer than necessary with the keepers of those places. As soon as their last cent is spent, they are necessitated to part with little articles of dress, to meet the demands made daily on them, by the very ones who professed friendship for them on their first appear- ance, and who would be the first to turn them out of doors when all they had was gone."  "You don't mean to say," inquired Barney, " that lodg- ing-house keepers would act in that mariner to poor fiendless girls, who were detained from seeking for work by such parties themselves, an' all for the sake of what they could wring from the emigrant's poverty?? "Troth, she's right, Barney in every word she has said, replied Alick, with a shake of his head. "An' what's more, many a girl she has saved from the worst oaf ruin and at very considerable trouble to herself, too, that I know." "Botheration! Alick, dear," cried his spouse; "but haven't you somethingforthetwo youngmen?   It'sjust wthis minute that I'm thinking of it,-the letters, you know.

Here it is; here they are, both of them; one for Mr.-" but, before Alick McSweeney had time to read the superscriptions, Barney had dashed toward him, and, getting one glance at the hand-writing, snatched them from him, bhanding one to Tim, while he nervously opened the other. The letters must have been very comforting to the young men, if the contents were to be judged by the hap- piness beaming on the face of Barney and the rosy smiles that played about the lips of Timothy Heggarty. "Good news, I hope? boys," suggested Alick. "Musha, then, but your impudence still sticks to you," remonstrated his wife. "What harm is there in hoping, I would like to know?" he inquired. "No harm in the least,", said Barney. "The news is good enough. This letter, Alick, is from a young woman at home, a friend of mine, an' I hope to make her some- thng else before I die." "Bravo I Barney," exclaimed Alick. "MayI live to see you as happy a dog as I am myself." "And what of Tim's little missive?" asked Mrs. Mc- Sweeney, seeing that "Alick's impudence still stuck to him," in spite of her desire to improve his manners. 6 "Just as good, ma'am, as Barney's, every bit of it; an' from as good a girl as Magheramore can boast." "Her name?" inquired Mrs. McSweeney. "Ailey O'Donnell," replied Tim. "Ailey O'Donnell!" repeated the good woman. "( Magh- eramore!"! and she began to collect her thoughts, as if something strange had passed before her mind.   78       The Lost Rosary. CTTAPTER XI. SEPARATION OF FRIENDS - BARNEY IN A W W SPHERT. "Where'er you go, be leal and true To Faith and Country ever; These be your marks. my honest friend, Let naught them ever sever." THE letters received by Barney and Tim were welcome visitors. They had a home fragrance about them most grateful to the hearts of the receivers. They were pure and holy in their nature, and probably the young men thought them too sacred to lay open before the eyes of their friends, Mr. and Mrs. McSweeney. That is the on- ly way to account for their desire to conceal the heart- 'felt effusions which had reached them on their arrival in New York. Barney McAuley had received a tempting offer to en- gage with a gentleman at Port Jervis, N. Y. At first he refused, unless he were accompanied by friend Tim; but the latter stoutly maintained that no such consideration should interfere with their " first piece of good luck." "But I had it in my mind," urged Barney, "from the day we left home together, that in good fortune, or bad, we should stick to one another in the New World." "An' I had the same thing before me," replied Tim; "but it's only for a while, an'if the same offer were made to me, I'm afraid I should take it, whether the conditions included your company or not." This was not exactly the truth; but Tim endeavored to   The Lost Rosary.         79 make himself believe that he would have acted as he said. The fact was, he saw that their prospects of work were neither so plentiful nor so numerous as he had ex- pected before landing, and he wished that Barney would not reject, on his account, the excellent offer he had re- ceived. 'Well, if that is the way you see things," said Barney, "perhaps it is as well that I should go." "Of course it is," urged Tim; " an! then, only think that if I don't succeed, sure I'll have to ask you to ren- der me some assistance, till such time as I do fall in." This finished the whole matter. Barney accordingly took a warm-hearted leave of Tim, the latter in all con- science feeling that he had been a thousand times better pleased if things had been so ordered that his cousin might have remained near to him. His departure was the renewal of sorrows lately experienced, but partly forgotten. For the first time since he left Ireland, Barney McAu- ley felt a bitter loneliness of heart, such as he had never felt before in all his life. He questioned within himself whether it were better to suffer separation from his friend Tim, for the advantages to be gained; and, for a considerable time, debated whether he should not return. Did Tim feel as much as Barney? That was a predomi- nant thought in Barney's mind. There was the least tinge of selfishness in dwelling on it; yet Barney did dwell on it, and, had he but known, poor Tim did feel the separation as keenly as possible. "But, sure, we didn't come here all the way to indulge our friendship at the expense of our chances of success," said Barney to himself, the first morning after his arrival at his new place. Quite right, Barney! True friendship is valuable and pleasant, but must not be indulged in at the expense of the great battle of life. Neither is there any use in torturing oneself as to whether those we respect and   80        The Lost Rosary. love feel the pangs of separation as much as we do. There is generally many a good trait of character trace- able to this feeling, and we may rest assured that Barney McAuley was nothing the worse for such thoughts, es- pecially when we find his manly resolve brought quick- ly to his aid the reflection that the earnest work of life must not' be interfered with by our friendships. Barney settled himself down to work, and, as he found that most things were new to him, he exerted himself to the utmost to learn all that was required of him, both for the purpose of pleasing his master, and with a care- ful eye to the future. In this he succeeded admirably, and shortly found that he had little time left to indulge his feelings. Contentment and work kept him in good health, and, when he found leisure on a Sunday after- noon, he did not forget to employ that leisure in writing to Mary O'Donnell, once to Ailey, and often to Tim. As he did not generally finish his letters at one sitting, he had time to reflect; this reflection begot study, and proud was Mary O'Donnell to find that he aimed at ex- cellence in letter-writing, as well as in whatever related to his daily calling. A glance at one of his letters to Mary will enable us to see things that we would not other- wise learn concerning Barney. It was as follows:- PORT JERVIS, Sullivan Co., New York State,) September 18, 1845. } MY DEAR MARY:-This is the third letter I have written you since I came to America. Of course, as I said in my first, Tim an' myself received one each from you an' Ailey, shortly after we landed. We were then stopping for a few days in a friend's house. I showed your letter to Tim, an' he showed Ailey's to me. Perhaps the both of you did something similar. I am engaged with a farmer out in a very pleasant part of the, coun- try, at twenty dollars a month, found in everything. That's not bad, Mary, I'm thinking, especially for one who didn't know much about the work out here; but I have learned a good deal, an' am now quite fit to beat the best of them. We have no hedges here, none of the singing birds, like as at home; no roads of any consequence, for, you see, they com- menced railways here before they commenced to make roads, an' that leaves them very little necessity for the other kind of roads. The potatoes out here, at least some of them, are as sweet as our pears-that is, your pears, at home-but not half   The Lost Rosary.          81 so nice-looking. The master is never called master, but just bosh (boss), an' a very good bosh he is; He leaves a good deal to one's own decency, an' that's just where he shows himself a wise man; for, I do believe the servants do, twice as much for him as they would do for old Dick, at home, who used to get himself carried out in his chair to watch the potato setters, when one of them daren't lift his sleeve to wipe the wet off his face without a string of curses flung at him, poor thing. Well, as I was saying, the servants all like the bosh very well, an1 the whole country is very beautiful. There's the river Delaware, would do your heart good to see it; an' the Dela- ware hills, where one may shoot whatever they like without any one serving you with a summons to appear at the 'size court, for taking your share of God's creatures, that run wild about an' the very sightof them, giving you a good appetite for your dinner, if you haven't got your dinner before you see ther. Grapes grow outside In the open air here, and bosh has a whole lot of them growing that way. You just put up five or six sticks in a row, and nail thin ones across them, and the grapes run up them, before they become grapes, you know iust like kidney beans at home, an' sweet peas, an' I'm told they pay well. Turnips an' other things are much like as in Magheramore. An' now, dear Mary, as I said in my last, I was very sorry to hear of your father's poor health, but hope in God he is im- proved by this tilme. I often think of you, an' wonder would you like the place. rhe sky is beautiful blue, an' very clear, just like the clear blue eyes of a girl I used to know in your parts. It gets darker here far sooner than at home, and gets lighter in the morning all of a sudden, so that, in the evenings, there is very little time for a fellow to take a walk; not as at home where one could walk for a couple of hours, an' the shades of night falling round you so gradually. I'm very glad you prize the Rosary as you do. I knew you would never use it without a prayer for one whose life -is de- voted to you, just as if you were my wife already. Give my love to your father an' mother, an' to Aley, an' the neighbors, not forgetting blind Darby, the fiddler. Note the address an' write to me by return of post, when you have leisure. Ever Tour affectionate         BERNARD MCAULEY. P. S.-,Tim is working away like a brick, an' is carrying mor- ar.

A kiss, dear Mary, an' a sweet good-night. Provisions just the same as at home, but fish is more plenti- ul, and eggs a trifle bigger.         B. McA. Barney read his letter over repeatedly to satisfy him- ,elf that he had omitted nothing of importance. "I would have liked to, if I could just have hinted at ny expectations about herself; but I suppose she knows 6   82       The Lost Rosary. them without writing about them," soliloquized Barney. "Dear only knows," he continued, " what may happen, after all. I may see her sooner nor I expect, an' I may never see her at all." And Barney fell into a train of thinking, the reverse of comfortable. Like most people, he was at times light- hearted when his mind pictured the future with happi- ness and. success, and correspondingly down-hearted when he thought of the distance that separated him from the girl he loved. Everything was very- strange about him, and so widely different from the same state of things in Ireland. He did his utmost ,to reconcile himself to his new mode of life, and, if he had only known it, was succeeding admirably. But he did not know it, and believed his natural restlessness at times was a sign of incurable discontentment. The tone of Tim's letter led him to think that his cousin was much better off, and in the fuller enjoyment of an easier mind. He oftentimes wished he were near tot Tim, and some- times thought that New York was the best place, after all, for a stranger, especially a stranger from Ireland. One saw one's own kind there, and did not feel half so lonely; but then it was a good resolve, after all, to learn all about farming i n America, when that was to be the work hereafter. Right, Barney! There is wisdom in thy thoughts. Time will prove you right in the long run. He who comes to America, and has any knowledge of farming, should stick to that work devotedly. It may not have immediate attractions, but a few years will make the steadfast worker a landed proprietor,-and the day that sees the first spadeful of earth turned up on one's own farm, is the proudest day of our lives. That is the hour when the sun of independence dawns kindly on the rude conqueror, and hails him as a Man!   The Lost 0osary.        83 CHAPTER XIL Sq[TAN'GE OF A EV[E AD ITS CONSEQUENXCE--A. SCNo I WHCH MOLL HANLEY ACTS A PART. "I do not like you, Helen, love, I'd rather have my Nelly: A dirty action she's above-- Her name is lNelly Kelly. " JENNY and Nelly Clarkson were not long in settling down in New York. Their mother had got speedily over her bereavement, and felt somewhat lighter-hearted in consequence. She had a few half-respectable acquain- tances, and through their influence her daughters got employment: one of them as saleswoman in a shoe store, and the other as overseer in a dry goods concern, where some fifty girls were employed  at slop work. Jenny, who was situated in the shoe store, lived at a considerable distance from her sister, and seldom had any opportunity of seeing her. Theirmotherwas com- fortably situated as housekeeper to a poor Baptist min- ister in New Jersey; and divided her time between news- paper reading and attending to her employer's personal wants and the care of his dwelling. She visited the church where his ministrations were held, and took es- pecial care to note down all the good  things he said, so that she might pleasantly refer to them on Sunday after- noons, and show him how appreciative she was of his ef- forts at spiritual instruction It was wonderful how she succeeded aip , o rning a permanent fixture in the min-             : ^zzy   84       The Lost Rosary. ister's house. But, after all, there was a softness in the character of the Rev. Ebenezer Sookes which suited Mrs. Clarkson's little stratagems very nicely. They were both about the same age, but the housekeeper appeared the younger, and took particular pains to maintain her su- premacy in that one particular. Nelly had on more than one occasion severely repri- manded some of the girls under her charge, for calling her by her name. She wished to inform them, once for all, "that her name was Miss Clarkson-her Christian name being Helen"  It so happened that one of the girls who came out in the same ship with Nelly--that is, with Miss Helen Clark- son-was also named Nelly; and the lady overseer, when- ever she heard that girl called by her Christian name, was  often in the habit of turning round, as if she herself were called or spoken to; and that, of course, was very annoying, and necessitated some change. Besides all this, the Rev. Ebenezer Sookes used to visit the estab- lishment presided over by Helen Clarkson, and that young lady soon found out that "Nelly "was not half so respectable as "Helen." Nelly Noonan was, somehow, an object of hatred to Miss Helen Clarkson, and if she could have got rid of her, would have considered her tranquillity very much enhanced thereby. Poor little Nelly was a good girl, and very attentive to hler work, and very regular; and, indeed, was neither half so bold nor so forward as the other girls. She was also very beautiful, and was much liked and respected by her shopmates and by her employers. She did not know, however, that she had been guilty of three grave crimes: she was called Nelly; she came out to America in the same ship that carried Miss Clarkson; and she lived under the roof with those horrid creatures, Moll Hanley and Mrs. McGione.   The Lost Rosary.        85 "What a fine large family you have under your charge," said the Rev. Ebenezer Sookes to Miss Clarkson, one day, when that gentleman visited the lady at her place of business. "Yes, sir; pretty large, and pretty good upon the whole," replied Helen. The girls, hearing the sound of a gentleman's voice, raised their heads simultaneously, and, seeing the visit- itor, commenced to giggle. The overseer looked daggers at this manifestation of disrespect, after the compliment she had just paid the girls. The Rev. gentleman also felt a little annoyed, but managed to walk up and down among the workers, pretending not to notice the youth- ful improprieties which now beset him on all sides. "He's come a-courting Nell," said one of the young rebels. "No, he ain't; she goes a-courting of him, on pretence of seeing the old woman," said another. "Begor, his nose and his chin will soon make a pair of nut-crackers," said a young Hibernian to a girl be- side her. "Happy children!" mildly suggested the Rev. Ebene'zer to Helen. "Should we join in any exercise?" he in- quired. "I'm, afraid not, sir," replied the lady overseer. "They are in one of their giddy moods to-day, I perceive," she continued," although I was led into giving them a good character when you entered." "Oh, merely the thoughtlessness of youth; and, then, their home-rearing, Miss Clarkson, is seldom better than it ought to be," remarked the pious man, with the least sign of displeasure in the tone of his voice. "Where's your old woman, Sniggs?" was shouted out from among the girls, and a general chorus of laughter followed the query. Miss Clarkson could stand this thing no longer, and,   86       The Lost Rosary. dashing in among the flock, gave a ringing box in the ear to Nelly Noonan. The Rev. Ebenezer had made himself scarce, and, on looking at himself int a mirror, in a shop window, saw that an unnatural redness overspread his pale, mild face. "Good for her that she did not strike me in that fash- ion," said a girl, who saw the blow admninistered to little Nell. "If she smited me, I'd be after returning her compli- ment," said another; but Helen Clarkson either did not hear, 'or did not heed the remarks then made. The girls seemed by their manner to know more about the Rev. Ebenezer Sookes than did their mistress. Next day, Moll Hanley accompanied little Nell to the work-place, and requested an interview with "'Nelly Clarkson, the mistress." That personage presented herself at the door, and pertly inquired the business of Moll. "I just came over to learn, ma'am, whatever made you strike poor Nelly Noonan, yesterday?" "It's none of your business to come here to make any such inquiry," was the reply. "Och, in troth, an' I'll make it my business," said Moll, advancing towards the speaker, who retired a few steps backward. "She misbehaved herself in presence of a gentleman," said Miss Clarkson. "That ain't true," shouted half-a-dozen voices at the same time. "There, now; do you hear that?" triumphantly asked Moll, still advancing, and with a suspicious looseness about her arms. "These girls are rude, and don't speak truth," vehe- mently exclaimed Miss Helen. "Not half as rude as you," was shrieked in the over- seer'S ears.   The Lost Rosary.         87 "She's an impudent, naughty thing," persisted Miss Helen. "She is neither so impudent, nor so naughty, nor so ungrateful as the wretch that says so of her," roared Moll.  ;Do you call me a wretch?" frantically exclaimed Helen Clarkson, now fairly roused, and betraying by her white visage the strength of the passions raging within her. "What the divil else are ye; wouldn't I be callin' ye out of your name if I called you anything else?" contin- ued Moll, whose face was of a color the very opposite of the lady she addressed. "A wretch ye are, or ye would niver have left yer ould father to be attended on his dy- in' bed wid the strangers," persisted Moll, who paid the penalty of her outspoken nature by a well-directed blow on the nose from the gentle fingers of Miss Helen Clark- son. "Take that, Nell, in return!" shouted Moll; " an' that, too, for interest," she cried, following up her first attack. The noise and disorder of the place, consequent on this interruption, caused one of the partners of the establish- ment to rush in to inquire the-cause. The moment he saw  Moll and the overseer, he speedily comprehended how matters stood. Helen Clarkson endeavored to show that she was the abused person, and, so far as appear- ances went, they we're decidedly in her favor. The blood was rushing from her nose, and Moll Hanley stood quiet- ly by, holding her apron up to her face. An investigation into the whole circumstances of the affray was entered into on the spot, and resulted in a severe reprimand to the overseer, for outstepping the limits of her duty by striking any girl in the place. "An' a good girl, too, an' not ashamed to be called Nelly, either, not all as one." "That will do, my good woman," said the gentleman,   88       The Lost Rosary. "while we will- not permit any one to be badly used here, neither shall we allow you nor any one else to enter this place to create disturbances." "Faith an' when there's no one badly used, there will be no call for the likes of me to interfere," said Moll, with a very modest courtesy as she retired. When Moll Hanley reached home, she called for a drink of water. The excitement she had gone through continued after the cause had ceased. She had taken a liking to little Nelly Noonan, and would have gone through. fire and water either to serve her or "stand up for the poor thing's rights." "Musha, then, but it's flurried ye are, Moll," com- menced Mrs. McGlone; " where ha' ye been, an' what's the cause of your nose bein' swelled?" "Faith, an' its fightin' I was, an' ye would niver guess. with who." Mol then related the whole particulars of the siege she. had passed through, neither adding to nor-diminish- ing the facts of the case; and when she had thoroughly relieved. her mind to Mrs. McGlone, the latter laughed again and again, but poor Moll Hanley was bathed in tears. "Troth, there's nothin' to be ashamed of in what ye did for the poor orphan child," urged Mrs. McGlone. "rm sure your conscience would just tell ye as much"- and the good woman busied herself in preparing a cup of tea-for herself and Moll, keeping up a running fire of remarks on the character and conduct of Nelly Clarkson, all the time. "Dear be thanked, ye are not behouldin' to her, the saucy blade; or if ye were, I'm afraid yer lot wouldn't be an aisy one, any how," said the good woman, as she displayed her activity in arranging the tea-table.

"Y MARY and SORROW are nearly the same, SORROW is MARY in all but the name: Mary is Hope, in the hour of despair, Scattering gloom, the offspring of Care." AFTER the departure of Barney and Tim the affairs of life moved on quietly enough in Corny O'Donnell's household. At the earnest solicitation of the members of his family, Ailey remained permanently with Mary, and-contributed in no small degree, by her blithesome nature, to the happiness of her uncle, aunt and cousin. A good girl was Ailey. Her heart was often lonely and gad, but she kept her loneliness and sadness to herself. Any one she ever chose to lay open her mind to, was nat- Irally her cousin Mary. Alley's aunt (not the wife of Corny) had persecuted her on more than one occasion, mnd in many a subtle way, too, in behalf of a young gen- ;leman who had fallen deeply in love with her niece. rhe latter had borne all this quietly enough, until one Evening her aunt persisted in the exercise of her author- ty to an extent that became insufferable. Personal vio- ence had been used, but Ailey concealed that from the world. Her state of dependence, and her desire to keep rom public service among strangers, were well known ;o her aunt, who used that knowledge too often to the pirl's disadvantage. Things of this sort were at the worst before Ailey had even seen, much less became ac-   90       The Lost Rosary. quainted with, Tim Heggarty,--so that her obstinacy to her aunt's desires did not arise from any pre-engage- ment of her heart. The young man, in whose behalf the aunt had done so much, was called Morris. He was the youngest son of a land steward, and, as maybe supposed, had many opportunities of visiting Ailey's residence. From the first hour of their acquaintance, Ailey treated. him with indifference, especially in the absence of her aunt, who managed to leave the young people as 'much as possible by themselves in private. Ailey felt her maid- en modesty insulted by this conduct, and used every stratagem to defeat the intentions of her relative. She was never bold nor insulting in so doing, but rather ap- peared the defender of her aunt's thoughtlessness, as she termed it, On one occasion, when thus deserted by one who should have sheltered her next her heart, ratter than expose the virtuous maiden heedlessly to temptation, Ailey told the young man Morris to desist at once from visiting the place, otherwise she would make known to her friends a matter that she preferred keeping secret. The matter to which Ailey referred, was an indecent and dishonorable proposalmade by Morris to the girl, on his last visit. She flashed a look of scornful disgust at her insulting visitor, and left him at once, never imagin- ing for a moment that the base fellow would venture to repeat his annoyance. He made one more visit, and one only,-and the chances are, poor Ailey would have been spared that repetition but for the presumption on - the part of Morris, consequent on his position with the aunt. Ailey had never shown him any conduct even approach- ing to rudeness, until the spoiled puppy had degraded whatever character for manhood he possessed, and then he was made to understand the exact position he held towards Ailey O'Donnell. Disclosing her mind on these matters one day to Mary, she declared that 'she never knew the meaning of hatred till that moment of her life.   Thle Lost Rosary.       91- "I saw at once," said Alley, " that my foolish aunt en- couraged Morris in the hope that he would assist her to a renewal, of the lease of her place. When she first pro- posed that I should accept his addresses, I looked at her in astonishment; and asked her if she did not know that he, and all belonging to him, were Protestants. She half laughed at such an objection, and do you knowwhat she told me, Mary?  "How should I?" replied the other girl.   t ' That Clarkson and his wife were of different persua- sions before they were married." "I heard my mother say the same thing before," added Mary; "and, by all accounts, the poor man never did well afterwards. For certain, I know that during the time Jenny and Neily were at school in Derry, the mother tried hard to give them an appearance that ill became her means."  "But when my aunt," Dcontinued Ailey, " pointed out the like of that for an example that I might follow, I did indeed, cousin dear, feel how lonely I was in the world," and the tears ran down the cheeks of the speaker. "One would have thought that if she had found you careless enough to give any encouragement to the advances of Morris, that she would have guarded you against such imprudence, by citing the example of the Clarksons as a warning," said Mary. "And that was, in substance, what I told her myself," said Ailey. "Tim, I suppose, never learned anything of this?" inquired Mary. "No'" was the answer; "I thought that perhaps he did, but he never once alluded to anything of the kind; and I know his good nature so well, that I an! sure if he had heard of it he would have told me, or hinted at it in some way. There was this much I could see in Tim: he did not like my aunt, but he studiously refrained from telling me so."7   92       Tle i'ost Rosary. Times were going hard with Corny O'Donnell. He had lost a portion of his land; and, as he had made up his mind to a sort of certainty that he would get leave to retain it, the blow came- on him with greater force. Then, again, the potato crop had shown symp-- toms which he had never observed before. He had al- ready suffered considerable loss by that part of his farm- ing, and, although he endeavored to appear, to those around him, as-indifferent as-some of his neighbors, yet it was evident that he was brooding over these things in his mind, and his health gave evidence of a very con- siderable decline. Mary was the first to perceive these things, and she left nothing untried to raise her father's mind from con- templating the result of what was happening. She was constant and ceaseless in those little attentions that, singly, are of no consequence, but which, when taken in the aggregate, amount to the greater part of the conso- lations in life. Alley discovered this, and backed up the grateful conduct of Mary. She often used to laugh him into a sweet temper, and had the strangest possible ways of reaching the old man's heart. She was a great little philosopher, was Alley. Nearly every act of her life towards others had a meaning in it, which meant as plain as smiles and good looks could convey--"What are all our troubles, when placed alongside the sufferings of others?" Corny was seated, one evening, in his usual corner, re- galing himself with his one solace--the pipe-when he made the inquiry of his wife, if she observed anything wrong with Mary and Ailey for the last few days. "To be sure I have," was the reply to Corny. "They didn't like, poor things, to say anything about it to you; but Mary, the cratur, has lost a present she got, an' they're half wild about it ever since." "What was it?" inquired Corny, with evident con-   Th]e Lost Rosary.        .93 tern; "I wasn't aware the girl was gettin' presents from any one." "Well, it wasn't very much of a value, I suppose-but it was of value to her, I know. It was a nice little Rosa- ry, given to her by Barney McAuley, before he went to Ameriky." "Och, is that all?" said the old man; "you may buy her o e if you like; one's as good as another, I sup- pose." "'Deed an' I don't think it, especially in this case, Corny," said his wife. "Well, unless it's because that-itcame-frolm-him, I suppose," drawled forth Corny. That's just where the value is," said Biddy, warm- ly. "Besides, every one knows there's a good dale in the kind of the present, and a good dale, too, in the person it comes from, and the one who receives it, and the cir- cumstances of givin' it, and that's what makes the loss what Mary says of it." "An' what in the world does she say of it?" asked Corny, inwardly satisfied that every word his wife had uttered was true. "Well, here's the girls themselves, an' you just ask them," said his wife. Mary and Alley had been in a fruitless search for the little treasure, and had just returned, Mary looking pale and careworn. "Your mother's just after tellin' me," began Corny, "that you lost somethin' yesterday, or the day before, or Sunday last, or-lately, an' that you're uneasy about it." "Dear uncle," said Ailey, drawing a  seat beside him, "it is only a little Rosary that Mary has lost, but I think she will likely find it." "Well, I'm sorry for it; an' only that she values it on account, I suppose, of the giver. Can't she get another as good as it?"   "       The Lost Rosary. "Yes, yes, uncle, of course; but there are many little things - at least, I suppose so - that would render that particular Rosary of great value to Mary; and I'm sure that none that you or any of us could purchase would have the same value in Mary's eyes." "Very likely, very likely," said Corny O'Donnell, thoughtfully; " an' that just reminds me--" and Corny retired to his little room. "Had yees no luck?" inquired Mrs. O'Donnell, "since you went out?"  "None, mother," answered Mary. "How miserably stupid I must have been," continued the poor girl, her voice trembling with emotion. "I kept it locked up in my own drawer for over a fortnight after he left, and then I thought to myself I might carry it carefully enough in my pocket." "Well, I'm sorry for it," added the mother; " but as the ould sayin' is, 'all's not in danger that's lost.' Sure, we can all keep our eyes, open, and who knows?"- she added. "I that's in danger, may not be lost," said Ailey, correcting her aunt, and in a cheerful voice. Very little more was said on the matter. Mary was truly miserable. The Rosary given to her by Barney, be- longed originally to his mother. It had been a present from his father to her before their marriage. Attached to the beads was a small silver Cross, with the letter"M " on the back. Mary knew right well that there was not another living being to whom Barney would have given that same Rosary. The gift contained within itself a world of thoughts to the giver and the receiver. On the part of him who gave it, it meant that he parted with that which he treasured far above all else he possessed. It was a memento of the early days of his dead mother; when her heart first awoke to the promptings of a holy and an abiding love. It was a prdof of the faith and   The Lost Rosary.         95 sincerity of him who gave it; eloquently speaking of the bond of true religion that bound two fresh and hope- ful hearts. Again, it had been used for almost similar purposes; but, before its second use, it had been sancti- fied in the eyes of a faithful son. When Barney McAu- ley received it, there was no kind word to accompany the gift. It was the last piece of matter on earth of which his mother's soul was conscious. Reverently he loosened it from her fingers in death. Her last kiss was yet warm on the Cross, from the lengthened pressure of that sacred emblem on her lips. No wonder if the son's hand trembled as he deposited the relio in [ary's hand. The single engraved letter had reference to his mother, whose name was Mary. It had also a singular significance in the eyes of her who received it, as her name also was Mary,-and especially as the devotions it was used for kept another holy name ever present in the mind of whoever made the circle of its beads. Bar- ney knew that it would serve as a kind remembrancer to the beloved recipient, to think of him, and to pray for him when far away.   96       The Lost Rosary. CHAPTER XIV. THE FAMTNE PERIOD- DEATH OF CORNY O'DONNELL. "O Christ! Thy people died-- Died of hunger, I am told; And their voices to Thee cried- 'Save the remnant of Thy fold.'" MARY, assisted by Ailey, and those few to whom she communicated her loss, made every effort to discover THE LOST ROSARY, but all was of no avail. Did Mary speedily forget her loss? Ah, no! She mourned for it, and prayed for its restoration most fervently. But she did not then discover the little treasure. Even her fa- ther felt more in the matter than he chose to make ap- pear. He was strongly of opinion that some one in the. neighborhood had found it, and not knowing to whom it belonged, retained it Corny O'Donnell felt much for his daughter; and al- though not regular in his attendance at Mass, even on Sundays, promised Mary he would keep a sharp look out in future, to try and assist her in the discovery,--for Corny was a changed man in his feelings toward Barney McAuley, although he kept that to himself as well as he- could. And so Corny got into the habit of regularly attend- ing Mass nearly every morning, still hoping to comfort- his daughter some day with a sight of the Rosary. He  did not succeed in finding it; but it was some consola- I tion to Mary to know that he had found something else whic] she often prayed for when using the same little Rosary.    - o      --\  *   The Lost Rosary.         97 The affairs of the world went badly with Corny O'- Donnell, and just in proportion as they failed him, his practice of looking for the Rosary increased. Bad times came again and again, until the full storm of the famine of '46 and '47 burst over the land, and left thousands upon thousands, who had never known want in their lives, exposed to the full fury of the desolation that swept over the warm hearths of the affrighted people. That was a period of much desolation and woe-a pe- riod, the distress of which appalled the stoutest, and made men's hearts sore with witnessing what they could not relieve. Full-freighted ships, bearing foreign grain, were floating on the ocean, destined for Irish ports. But from these same Irish ports went forth home-grown grain -in abundance-thousands upon thousands of heads of cattle and other live stock! Ireland was undera heavy visitation, for that country is under the rule of a for- eign power, and the visitation was made by England. It * is not meant by this that the loss of the potato crop was the work of England; but the effects of the famine arose more from mis-legislation, than from any work of nature. It is easy to advance proof of this, but such a proceed- ing would be out of place in a work of this kind. The subject is introduced here for the purpose of accounting for Corny's " heavy down-come in the world," as he him- self termed it. Coming into his house one morning after a careful ex- amination of a large field of potatoes, he sat down in his accustomed seat. He was evidently excited and ill. Observing his condition, kind-hearted Biddy, his wife, endeavored to cheer him by pointing out the misfortunes of others-greater than those he had to suffer himself, and not so able, in point of worldly circumstances, to bear them. s"There's that ten-acre field; an' I needn't attempt to get a spade put into it. Three days ago it looked fresh 7   98       The Lost Rosary. and green, an' to-day it's as black as that crook there over the fire." "Well, welcome be the will o' God," fervently added his wife. Aye, aye; I can say that now,too, but I couldn'thave said it twelve months ago." "Yes, you could," replied Biddy;." but you just thinkl you couldn't." "What's to become of us, Bid?" he inquired. "I feel it here badly, badly," he said, passing his hand over his heart. Corny O'Donnell, it's flyin' in the face o' God ye are, so it is, to be bringin' bad health on yourself with your thoughts about the poor carcass of a body that you can't keep an hour in life longer nor God wills it. Raise your spirits, man, an' be above the like. I don't deny but you might raisonably give some thoughts to what's happen- in' with yourself, an' with many others around us, but to fly in the face of Providence the way you're doin', is a sin before the Almighty, so it is," said Biddy, with a warmth that touched the old man keenly. "What's to become of us, Biddy?" he inquired, with a very dejected air; "what's to become of us, an' that poor thing Ailey-must we send her away? Mary will break her heart after her. Aye, what's to become of us?" "Corny O'Donnell, rm sorry to hear you," replied his wife, who knew the strong passions working in her hus- band's'breast, and wished to counteract them; " sorry to hear you, indeed. Here we are, both old, with only one child to support, an' we never knew want since the hour we were born, an' now, at the first darkenin' of the cloud, you dare to despair of that Power that kept you an' yours well off in the world since the hour we came into it. One would think, man alive, that God had become -less, or that he hadn't the power to watch o'er us as for- merly, to see you take on so." .   The Lost Rosary.         99      1 Corny was silent. A spasm had passed over his heart. A strange feeling of pain such as he had never experi- enced before, rendered him almost as pale as death. It was with considerable difficulty he managed to retire to bed. His good wife helped him, and used every little stratagem she could think of to lighten his mind. She was not far astray, in ascribing the change she observed in her husband to the terrible fatality that was bringing desolation to so many homes; still, there were other causes, of which both she and her husband were unaware, to account for Corny's suffering. It was not altogether mental pain he endured, although that was, in all prob- ability, the original cause. When Mary and Ailey entered, they were terribly sur- prised at the change they witnessed. Without taking much time to consider what was best to be done, Ailey drew her cousin aside. "I don't know what to make of uncle's changed ap- pearance," she said; "L but, in any case, it can do no harm to send for a doctor." "I would as soon Father James saw him, and at once,"9 replied Mary. '"Tis a long distance to go for a doctor,". she added, " and Father James is known to be very skil- ful.' "Both are best," said Ailey, hurriedly, and accordingly messengers were at once dispatched for priest and doc- tor. In less than half an hour Father James arrived, and, hurrying into the apartment where Corny lay, saw at one glance, that the case was much more critical than he had expected. Those who were present retired, and, in about ten min- utes, the clergyman came forth, and inquired if there was any word of the doctor. There was none. Both Mary and Ailey ran distractedly out on the road,   100       The Lost Rosary. to see if there was any appearance of that gentleman. Neither spoke to the other, but each felt that a crisis was at hand, as they beheld the agitated appearance of the priest. Corny's wife flung herself down on her knees by the bedside, and groaned aloud. It was pitiful to behold her grief. The suddenness of the blow was such, that she could not realize it. Only an hour or two ago, and she was bantering her poor husband; and, although her mo- tives in doing so were of the purest nature, yet poor Biddy now blamed herself as being the cause, in some way, of what had happened. She mentioned these things to Father James, but the good priest told her to make her mind easy in regard to that. He was afraid, he maintained, that Corny was stricken down, either by par- alysis or some disease of the heart, and, as either of these came on very suddenly, she had no cause to attrib- ute anything of the kind to herself. Corny endeavored to make her understand by signs that he knew what was preying on her mind, and stretched forth his hand, with considerable effort, to- wards her. His wife grasped the hand, and affection- ately pressed it to her lips, and then to her heart. At that moment, Mary and Ailey rushed in with the word that they saw the doctor descending the hill. He was on horseback, aud coming along quickly. Both girls, seeing how matters stood, were soon upon their knees beside the mother. Corny had heard them en- ter, and opened his eyes to look towards the heart-broken girls. There wasa sudden passage of pain across his face, but it vanished quickly, and was superseded by a sweet smile. The doctor entered, and, after the first sight he got of the sick man, inquired if he had spoken lately? The priest informed him that he had, and distinctly, too, till within a few minutes ago.   The Lost Rosary.       101 I'm afraid," said the doctor, "he has spoken his last." The wife, daughter, and niece, had caught the words, and burst into renewed grief. Corny opened his eyes and closed them, alternately, for the space of a quarter of an hour. It was evident, now, to all, that a great change was at hand. The doctor saw that nothing he could do would avail the sick man. Taking Father James aside, he told him there was a strong probability that another fit would take place before morning, and that would be the last; if not, he would pass quietly away. He then retired. Father James knelt, and the suppressed breathing of those around the bed of the dying was all that was heard for some time. A low moan escaped the lips of poor Corny, his eyes closed tightly, and an ashy tear fell on the -pale cheek. There was a quiver over the body, then another, of greater pain than the one previous. The priest was the only one who observed these, and he fully expected that the doctor's predictions were about to be verified, even then. He was mistaken, however. All that he saw of Corny O'Donnell was the poor remains of mortality; the soul had fled to its Creator, ere those loving ones who surrounded the body were aware ,that Death had been present I A minute or two passed away, and then, as the truth dawned on the minds of those friends, whose souls were holding converse with heaven in behalf of a departing soul, a loud piercing wail burst almost simultaneously from the three bereaved ones. Father James remained standing, and his heart was buried in grief, as well for those present as for poor Corny, whose nature he knew well. He did not even attempt to soothe the sorrow that welled up around him. He allowed it to find expression, as he well knew that by such means calm would sooner be re- stored to the bruised hearts of the friends. Then he knelt again, and quietly asked them to join him in a Rosary.   102      The Lost Rosary. Meantime, word had spread over the country that "Corny O'Donnell had been struck down dead!?' Some had it that the visitation of God was so sudden, that the poor man had not time to bless himself. Others maintain- ed that he had burst a blood-vessel, and had bled to death. Various were the numerous and highly exaggerated ac- counts, as generally happens, when anything pertaining to sickness or death takes place in country districts. The house of Corny rapidly filled with people, and many and genuine were the expressions of sorrow made for the dead and the living-for Corny and his rela- tives. During the " waking of the corpse," the loss of Mary's Rosary was incidentally mentioned among those of the neighbors present, and one old woman maintained that she saw a strange-looking lady walking behind Mary, one morning, as the latter proceeded from Chapel, and observed her stoop and pick up something, which the lady stood examining for a few minutes, and then trans- fered to her pocket. The bearer of this intelligence was a shrewd old person, who readily connected the act she had witnessed, on the part of the strange lady, with the loss which Mary O'Donnell had sustained. She men- tioned these things, but then arose the question who was the lady-where was she from-where going to-could she be found? All these questions were duly proposed; but as might naturally be expected, were left unanswered, and any hopes that Mary had entertained heretofore of recovering the Rosary were now banished from her    mind. The lady must have been the person who found it, and, as no one knew her, there was not the least like- lihood of ever finding out her whereabouts.     ! The funeral took place, and the remains of old Corny  O'Donnell were consigned to their last resting-place in the Old Chapel Yard, there to await their final resur-  rection. Corny had never known what it was to be well   The Lost Rosary.        103 liked by his neighbors. Now, that he was gone, there was nothing but kind words spoken of hin: He did no one any injury, and just had a way of his own, and "God help us, who is there who hasn't that same." Such were the feelings entertained regarding him; while on the other hand, kind, and, even affectionate, were the feel- ings entertained for those who were left behind. Warm- hearted Irish people! It does not require the visit of Death to bring forth the kindly impulses of your nature; but when that stern visitor does appear, soft and tender, as the sweet affections of a child, come forth those sterl- ing qualities of the heart that render your name a theme of gratitude for ever.   104       The Lost Rosary.

"From the cabins and the ditches, in their charr'd uncoffin'd masses, For the Angel of the Trumpet will know them as he passes; A ghastly spectre army before great God we'll stand, And arraign you as our murderers, the spoilers of our land." CO:RoY'S wife continued ill long after the demise of her husband. They had battled life together for over twenty years,-had their days of hardships and struggles, of ill-temper and repose. Many a difference had cloud- ed their lives, but there was generally sunshine after the storms; and so they jogged along together, leaning closer toward each other as the years they had passed made their infirmities more visible. Times got worse with those whom Corny O'Donnell had left behind. Indeed, his wife and daughter were ill- suited to bear the burden which had fallen on them.  To add to their sorrows, the correspondence with Amer- ica had ceased. This was, indeed, perplexing to the whole of them, especially as the letters they had received from both Barney McAuley and Tim Heggarty breathed the utmost affection, and were filled with a frank avowal of the love the young men entertained for Mary and Ailey. The latter in turn, although not altogether too plain in l the avowal of their love, as might naturally be expected from girls in their position, towards the young men, were at least warm-hearted in their admiration of their f   The.

In fact, the letters of the girls were all that could be expected, and those to whom they were written looked upon them as welcome visitors in the land of their exile, recalling many happy memories of pleasant days and bright hours spewt at Home. Many and anxious were the inquiries made by Ailey to Mary, and by Mary to Alley, concerning the falling off of the letters from America. They both agreed that some- thing must have happened. But what was that some- thing? Therein was the whole mystery. If they could have discovered that something, how  many weary thoughts would have been spared them; how many tortuous windings of thought; looking at this side of the difficulty, and at that; raising questions that- could not be answered, and trying to account for impossibilities. Thus is it ever and always with those who, separated by great distances, have their hearts so knit together that time nor space cannot sunder. Probably if all things were known, Barney and Tim were just as much, nay, more annoyed and confused at the non-receipt of their usual letters, which, to them, were as precious as all they possessed. But they were men, and had not the tender hearts and minds of Ailey or Mary. They were rough, and could bear such things better. Ah! how few are able to judge of these matters. A rough exterior is but the outward coat that conceals the finest feelings that ever played within a human breast. Men are too often misjudged.  Outward appearances are not the safest guarantee to guide us in forming our judgment. They who use no other standard are sure to form a wrong estimat 1 of that which they try to compre- hend, and so fail to perceive the noble traits that rough exteriors conceal. Wonder as they might, neither Ailey nor Mary ever !                    X   106       Tlhe Lost Rosary. managed to divine the cause of the silence they lament- ed, and while others would naturally have laid the blame on the absent ones, neither of these girls, even for one moment, ever dreamed of ascribing the silence of the young men to indifference toward those they left behind. What! No doubt that change of scenes would beget other, perhaps pleasanter, companions? None. No anx- iety that changed circumstances would entail changed minds? None. No fears that contact with others would create a desire to throw over the loves of a distant land? None, whatever. Noble girls! So much is true of you. No shadow of such things ever crossed your minds. Constancy and fidelity were with you the very essence of existence. Clear and bright as your own virgin purity was the faith that Barney and Tim were as true as yourselves, and as deserving of being so considered. That was the en- nobling thought that rose superior to every other, and that sufficed to still, at least in some measure, the anxie- ties that now beset you and caused you to feel so un- happy. So sobn, too, after your late sufferings.' But remember, that one trouble seldom comes alone. Life is made up of contrarieties, and the unevenness of its paths are the proofs that it is the road of life on which we travel. Mary O'Donnell felt keenly, indeed, the altered circum- stances of her life.^ Yet the true-hearted girl endeavored to rise superior to the difficulties that -surrounded her. The poor mother drooped day after day, and seemed buried in her sorrows. She took a sad pleasure in brood- ing over them, and few words except those of lamenta- tion ever escaped her lips. At every appearance of renewed energy on the part-  of her faithful daughter, ably seconded by cousin Ailey the old woman but felt her unhappiness increase. s"Where's the use, poor things, in yer tryin' to work?" she would say, half reproachfully.   The Lost Rosai-y.        107 "But it is our duty, mother, to try. Unless we try our very best, how can we hope to succeed?" would be \ Mary's reply. "God help yees; God help yees!" she would mutter. "The only bit o' land taken from us when poor Corny- God rest his soul--was called away. What can we do? what are we fit to do?" she would ask, while the rock- ing of her body to and fro indicated the want of hope that darkened her mind, and caused her to brood over her difficulties. "What is it we can't do, dear aunt, if we only have courage to try?9 " gently urged Ailey. "I'm sure," con- tinued the faithful-hearted girl," that one half of our miseries are created by ourselves, and the other half would vanish in presence of a stout heart and a firm wil." "Oh, dear, to be sure," said her aunt  "youth is al- ways youth; clear-sighted to see the fine weather break- in' out o' the black cloud. There was a time, Alley, when your uncle and myself were as light-hearted as larks; but he's dead, an' poor me, I'm left alone in the world, with a cowld corner to gaze ,at, an' not knowin' the day when we must lave the ould spot, an' trust our- selves to the keepin' o' others as poor as we are, an' that's poor enough, ochone!?' "Indeed, I don't think, dear mother?" said Mary, who had just entered, after performing an honest day's work for a neilghboring farmer, in the fields, " that we have so much cause to complain, after all." "How can you say so, Mary?" indignantly inquired her mother. "Look at your poor hands, an' your face, an' the whole o' you, then hear how you talk," and the broken-hearted mother covered her face with her hands, and gave vent to the feelings of sorrow crowding thick and fast upon her mind.             b "A little fresh water anid a towel will soon put that all   108       The Lost Rosary. right," replied Mary, quite cheerfully, who, whatever her own feelings as to her changed condition in life, succeed- ed admirably in concealing them from her afflicted moth- er. "A pretty sight we would be, indeed," continued the faithful daughter, " if we would sit down and mope at every little discomfort, instead of making use of the good health that God has given us to work for our liv- ing." "And then, the sin of it, too," followed up Ailey: " fly- ing ungratefully in the sight of heaven, instead of hum- bly accepting what is evidently intended for our good. Hey-day, indeed! A fig for your poverty and trouble, as long as we have the health, and when we ourselves are guiltless of what has befallen us." "Is there no word from the Big House yet?" faintly inquired the old woman. 'Not yet," said lMary; 'but I suppose we may just make up our minds for the same treatment the others are receiving.  On came the woes of that dreadful period. Darkly and thickly they fell, like blighting curses, sparing none, not even those whose comforts had never known the power of a rude hand, from their cradle days till their old age. The bright and happy harvest days were on the people, but the reapers' song was hushed, and the dull workers in the field, from mnorn till eve, plodded out their lives in the hopeless task of saving their bits of land. Starvation first, and next toil, unceasing toil to meet the demands of landlord rent. True, some of the more humane of that class remitted a tithe of the peo- ple's burdens, and did not press too heavily for immedi- v ate settlements. But that was of small avail to those who saw the second and third years' crops lay rotting in the earth, while the wheat and corn were harvested, not to be eaten, but for sale in the English markets, so that the ever-craving call of rent might be satisfied. Hard times, indeed!   The .Lost Rosary.       109 Fever followed, and the people rushed in streams into the larger towns, so that the sickening sight of the daily misery before their eyes might be diminished. 'Twas a glorious Sunday morning. The sun shone forth with unusual brilliancy. Every hedge-row, and lane, and loaning, were sweet with the balm of Nature; and the stricken hearts of the people felt the influence of -that morn. On their way home from the old Chapel, Mary and Aliley had learned from a friend that during the ensuing week they might expect the fatal missive, a i' notice to quit." That is a common death-knell in Ireland; a more powerful slayer than Famine. "What's best to be done?" inquired Aliley. "There is nothing left us in the way of choice," replied Mary, downcast and spiritless, in spite of all her efforts to the contrary. "We must arrange at once to leave, for if my poor mother learns the truth she will go delir- ious." Both girls were of the same mind on this point, and on their return Ailey informed her aunt that there was a strong probability of herself and Mary getting good employment in the town of B--. The old wo- man was rejoiced to hear the news, and wished to start just then. There was a dangerous-looking expression in her face and eyes that pained Mary and Aliley very much, but the poor things scarcely dared to speak their fears to each other. Next morning they started forth on their journey, trav- elling a part of the way on foot, then lessening the dis- tance on post-cars, until they reached the town where seats on the stage-coach might be secured that would take them the greater part of their journey.   "O       The Lost Rosary. CHAPTER XVL. IN THE I^ErER WARDS-A GLIMPSE OF THE LONG-LOST ROSARY. "Down the broad valley, fast and far, The troubled army fled; Up rose the glorious morning star, The ghostly host was dead." ARRIVED at the end of their journey, our three forlorn travellers felt weak and ill. Biddy O'Donnell's face, poor woman, was flushed and dry. Ailey, also, was in a sad plight, and her attempts to appear better than she really was were sickening to behold. The means at Mary's dis- posal, as may be readily guessed, were not large; how- ever, she scarcely ever once thought of -that. I Her mind was altogether occupied with her mother and cousin. To relieve her suspicions, Mary at once called in the aid of a doctor, who spent only a very few minutes in glancing at the old woman and at Ailey. "1 Typhus!" he exclaimed, and hurriedly wrote out an order for admis- sion to the hospital, recommending their removal at once. Mary's heart sank within her. She retired to a small apartment for a few minutes, and flinging herself on her knees, cried out in the perfect agony of her heart: "Ac- cept this sacrifice, O God! and thou, O Holy Mother, whose name I bear, obtain for me strength to bear this suffering, this terrible burden which--" and, overcome by the strength of her emotions, she remained in a semi- fainting fit, her poor heart lacerated with the tumult it   The Lost Rosary.        1" was doomed to bear. Hurriedly preparing her patients, who were still able to move slowly along, she bent her way toward the hospital indicated by the doctor. With tottering steps she bore the weight of her mother on one side and her dear cousin on the other. Arrived at the hospital gates, a sight presented itself to her such as she had never witnessed, and could not have believed to ex- ist'except in imagination. Stretched on the hard pave- ment of the street, on either side of the gate, lay some thirtypoor creatures, some of them in an advanced stage of fever. The building was an old barrack converted into a hospital for the time being, and filled with beds hur- riedly prepared for the reception of the large numbers who sought admission. Some of those beds were erected in the open yard, under temporary sheds hastily thrown up to protect the sick from the heat of the sun. As Ma- ry surveyed the sick group, she felt that her own misery was eclipsed by what she saw. It: was yet early in the morning, and many of those seeking admission had trav- elled all night. They lay gasping and moaning, burned with a scorching thirst, the one reclining on the other, packed and huddled together in a manner most pitiful to behold. Spreading an old cloak upon the ground, she assisted her mother and Ailey to rest thereon, and in- stantly girded herself to the task of assisting others. She looked wildly about her for a  few minutes, and then dashed off to the first house she could reach. No one was yet astir. She knocked loudly at the door, and was asked her business. 'She craved for a pitcher of wa- ter, and was refused. "Do rise and give me some water, for God's sake!" she urged; and a coarse-looking man appeared before her. O' O speed, and God will bless you See," said the girl, "those poor beings lying over beyond there; they are dying for a drink of cold water, and there is none to give them."   "2      The Lost Rosary. The man quickly supplied her, and Mary hastened on her work of mercy. Lowly she bent over them, and raised their weary heads while she assisted them to drink. Old men and old women, their gray hairs matted with heavy perspira- tion and dust, these she attended first. In a few min- utes she was off again for more water. Those she had already supplied, now craved for more. She supplied them again; spoke words of comfort in their ears; raised their drooping spirits, and rendered them every assist- ance it was in the power of one human being to per- form.

Cast your eyes, each haughty dame, from the glare of the ball-room, and behold in Mary O'Donnell the embodi- ment of a glory you can never possess. Divest your- selves of your pomp and your false splendor, ye lady in- triguers and scandal-mongers, whose tongues are blister- ed with defamation of your kind, and see if you are ca- pable of the heroism that shines in the every act -of the friendless Irish girl. Look on her, worldlings, and hear the blessings of youth and old age uttered in her regard, and say to your hearts, "Am I as worthy as that devoted daughter?"The answer is known but to yourselves. Let it rest there, and fructify until the hard covering of your hearts be eaten away by the oft-repeated question, "Am I as worthy as she?" And Mary O'Donnell is but a specimen of her class. Had Moll Hanley been beside her, she would have had a friend and helper, although the two had never exchanged -a word before. Had little Nellie Noonan been at hand, we cannot doubt that the poor child-girl would nobly have aided Mary.

Yes, my girl, success in the acquirement of anything at that expense, is, after all, a miserable failure.

See poor Mary O'Donnell, now indeed an orphan I She has stood by the grave of her mother, surrounded by strangers, without even one kindly heart to comprehend her sorrow. She hastens from the grave to the bedside of the sick. Ailey demands her care, and the heart of -the poor girl is thankful that she has at last obtained leave to nurse her cousin through her sickness. Weary days passed on, and Ailey O'Donnell's life hung trem- bling in the balance. Doubly watchful, now that her care devolved on only one, Mary sat at that post of duty, and carefully tended the sick one until all danger was past. Not even in those weary hours did Mary permit an opportunity to pass, whereby she might minister to the wants of others less cared for than Ailey. One night, when sleep was overmastering the patient watcher, a moan of pain fell sadly on her ear. Gently she approached the sufferer, and, as she kindly bent over her-a young woman about Mary's own age-she ob- served the hands convulsively clasped together, and raised from time to time to the parched lips to kiss some object which they held. A shriek escaped the lips of Mary, as she saw in the hands of the fever-stricken girl her long-lost RosARY! A ward nurse entered, and, beholding what she be- lieved to be a, struggle between Mary and the patient, ordered Mary to leave the place at once. The distract- ed girl endeavored to explain, but, in her effort, the nurse interpreted her words to cover an attempted act of theft! Mary was violently ejected from the place; and now behold her standing outside the gate of the hospital,   The Lost Rosary.        115 threatened, if she did not leave at once, to be handed over to the police, and cautioned to avoid returning there again. Poor Mary I Severe shocks to the nervous system often bring on disease; and sometimes, we are told, such shocks. avert the same. Mary's care of her cousin, and the trouble oc- casioned by her mother's death, had rendered her weak and feeble. She seldom bestowed a thought upon her- self, and it never entered her mind that the infection of the disease which surrounded her might poison the cur- rent of her own life. IThus it is often the case, that those most exposed to disease are oftentimes proof against all contagion. At all events, Mary passed through her ordeal trium- phantly. During  all her sufferings, her thoughts often wan- dered to Barney McAuley, and, especially since her harsh removal from attending on Ailey, his image was often before her; and we need not wonder if, in her heart, she earnestly desired that he was beside her. Ailey was fast improving, and one day she received a letter from Mary, acquainting her with all that had trans- pired regarding the Rosary, and asking her to seek out the girl, and inform her of the proper ownership. Ailey was unfortunate in being of any assistance. The young woman had got better, and had left, and, a few days af- terwards, Ailey herself was fit to leave. '(* ?

"He was a timid, gentle slave, Who often wished to be as brave As those of his sex he saw around, But bravery yet he never found." THE Rev. Ebenezer Sookes had some trouble occasion- ally with the members of his congregation, and where is the pastor who has not had that same. Some averred that he did not pay sufficient attention to the " waifs and straws " to be found floating about in all directions in the great City of New York. There were those benight- ed things from Ireiand--servants in places, and out of places-poor, ignorant creatures, sent across the Atlan- tic by the hand of Providence, who, in order to reach the hardened hearts of idolators, punishes and afflicts them for His wise ends. Others attached to that holy body, were of opinion that the new housekeeper occupied his time too much, and prevented the pastor from ful- filling his mission. Some were of opinion, that the good man's visits to the establishment presided over by Miss Helen Clarkson were too frequent for the results ob- tained in the way of Biblical exercises. Even things like these came to the ears of the ladies of that over- watchful congregation. Others held to the belief that, after all, the Rev. Ebenezer did not believe in his own advocacy of woman's rights; that he felt as if he had   T-he Lost Rosary.       117 gone too far in that respect, and required to cool down a little. "I certainly have heard it said, that he informed Miss Longhow that we were quite too far advanced in our opin- ions," said a lady member of the congregation to anoth- er lady member of said body. "Strange creature!" added the latter lady, " what can he mean by being too far advanced in our opinions, I should like to know?" "I am sure I cannot divine his meaning," said the first speaker. "What are we seeking for?" "Yes, what are we seeking for?" echoed her compan- ion. "Nothing but equality; and, after all, to be only equal to the likes of him." "Yes, indeed, the likes of him " "And I'm quite certain the day ain't far distant when we shall look for our proper equality." "Our proper equality is just the proper sentiment," chimed in lady No. 2. "If he were a high man, one could be satisfied with equality." "But he is far from being a high man; not even as tall as----" "You miscomprehend the inevitable meaning that I attach to the--to the-term high. I should say exalted, elevated, raised, excelsior-like, morally, mentally,-not physically." "Of course, my dear; that is just my meaning, also." "And then he insinuates that we should not be carried away by popular enthusiasm, and forget which ballot- box to use when we obtain the franchise." "How very weak-minded, indeed. Perhaps he thinks we are all as near-sighted as he is himself." "And he keeps saying that women are just fitted to minister to household duties, and that they should never   "8       The Lost Rosary. aspire to things not given them to know; and that we mistake our mission whenever we speak of our claims, and should rest satisfied to be no better than the poor drudges of females who lived for thousands of years be- fore us; forgetting that this is the age of progress and steam power; and is not the least afraid to insinuate that it is only noisy brawlers who take on as we do; and that -that we would be acting a decenter, better part, and one more becoming our sex and age, if we refrained from our glorious agitation "-and the speaker sank back into an arm-chair, fairly exhausted, physically, and men- tally tortured at the obliquity of her pastor's perception in making such terrible charges. The companion lady ran to the last speaker's assist- ance, and, by fanning her, and applying a goodly quantity of eau-de-cologne, eventually restored the eloquent "blue stocking " to her usual equilibrium. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to state that the poor Rev. Ebenezer never was guilty of one iota of the cliarges so impertinently laid against him. The fact was, the great- er part of his congregation consisted of aged spinsters, who managed to make their pliable pastor much more like a good-natured sheep, than one used to taking charge of a numerous flock of lambs. He was everything they wished him to be, and, strange to relate, he failed to please. One great failing the poor man had, which was much in his disfavor-he kept a housekeeper! Alas, poor Sookes! Had he kept two or three dozen, the chances are he would have stood higher in the favor of the spinsters. But there was not enough of Brigham Young about him, and so he had no defenders. Was the Reverend Ebenezer aware of the world's opinion of men in his position; or, if aware, did he care to conciliate that opinion and render it subservient to his own interests? We are afraid that the good man Sookes knew very little of the world, over and beyond his intercourse with the   The Lost Rosary.        119 members of his congregation. He was a Methodist, a Revivalist, a Baptist, an advocate of woman's rights, an earnest worker in the field of missionary labor, provided said field consisted in gliding here and there to nice-little evening parties, shaking hands-or, more properly speak- ing, finger tips with ladies whose age forbade the cus- tom of whole-hand shaking. In such gentle exercises, the Reverend Sookes was a missionary of the highest or- der. Mild tea-drinking, a little sherry, claret occasion- ally, and other helps of a spirituous kind, did go some length in elevating whatever there was of man- hood in his composition to thoughts of heroic work and conversion of sinners. Perhaps he couldn't help it, but the sublime desires that filled his bosom to overflowing, when under the influence of eyes made bewitchingly ra- diant by the same good things that fired his inner man, generally failed him in proportion as the ruby of the glass descended. This special weakness was often the cause of some hard hits at the character of Ebenezer; but as he seldom felt the hits, he did not suffer much in consequence. One evening, just as he had taken his seat in his par- lor, with his feet newly transferred to a pair of warm slippers, and the tea-table arranged for himself and Mrs. Clarkson, who had patiently awaited his home-coming, the Reverend Ebenezer gave a  glance at a little corner cupboard and heaved a  sigh, which his housekeeper in- terpreted to mean  "( an evening appetizer." Gently laying her hand upon his shoulder, she asked, in a tone of voice that would have defied half the world to know that she had ever been a farmer's wife, "Would he have it strong or mild?" "Neither too strong, nor too mild," was the answer, given in a tone of unction that would have melted the heart of a savage, it was so tender, so sweet, so plaintive, so melodious, so mellifluous, and combining within it-   120       The Lost Rosary. self such exquisite softness, that its charms reached the heart of the speaker himself, who wished there had been a score or two of appreciative Clarksons present to be bewitched by the one effort he had made. "That voice I " said Mrs. Clarkson, as she proceeded to fulfil the pleasant duties imposed upon her by her po- sition. The aroma of Cogniac now blended beautifully with that of the Oolong, and produced a fragrance most grate- ful to the elderly nerves of Sookes and his servant. Be- hold this worthy pair comfortably seated at the table; Sookes with his chair drawn lovingly towards Mrs. Clark- son's crinoline. "Do you know, Mrs. Clarkson," softly repeated Sookesr "that I have had it in serious contemplation to propose a momentous question to you?" "( Yes," answered the housekeeper; and, as a vision of future happiness arose before her mental vision, a sudden knock came to the door, instantly dispelling the rose-col- ored imagination of Mrs. Clarkson's mind. Quickly ris- ing to attend to the duties of her calling, a hardened frown overspread her previously composed features. "What the divil brings you here at this time?" were the first words addressed to the visitor on entering, who happened to be the speaker's eldest daughter, Miss Helen. "Don't be displeased, dear mother. I justthoughtyou would be alone," replied the girl, hastening into the par- lor, and giving the gentlest shriek imaginable as she be- held the Rev. Ebenezer Sookes. "My heart rejoiceth at this unexpected visit," gallantly exclaimed Ebenezer, rising and cordially inviting Miss Helen to be seated. The mother had found it necessary to be a minute or so behind, in order to smooth down her ruffled feathers. Presently she entered, and found the seat she had just vacated now occupied by her daughter.   The Lost Rosary.        121 "Really, really, I am charmed with Miss Clarkson's healthful appearance," said the Rev. Ebenezer to his housekeeper. "What a fine girl you must have been Mrs. Clarkson, when you were about--'-" Another rap at the door caused the gentleman to pull up, before the doubtful compliment he was about to pay the elder lady had finally escaped his lips. "Oh, it's only our Jenny," exclaimed Miss Helen. "She promised me the other night -to call over about this time, to see mother." Mother's temper was in a delight- ful mood. She smirked her sweetest smirks, and endeav- ored to be so very, very glad at seeing her dear daughters. "An' how do youi like your place, Nelly?" artlessly in- quired her sister. "Learn to know your sister's proper name, before you make any inquiries," said the mother, rather severely. Jenny Clarkson looked very confused, and began won- dering if her sister had changed her name. "You must know, Jenny," remonstrated the Rev. gen- tleman, " that Helen is much more befitting the honor, dignity and character of your sister, than the vulgar name of Nelly. Only think of the ridiculous aspect of the great Trojan war, my dear, if the cause had been a common Nelly." "Yes; only think of that war," chimed in Mrs. Clark- son. "Well, if she's to be 'Helen' I may as well be 'Jane,'" quickly retorted the younger daughter, with as much acidity in the tone of her voice as indicated her displeas-e ure at mother, sister, and Ebenezer included. "However, it's not about names I came here, but to see if we can't arrange to live together, and not be sepa- rated as we are at present," said Jenny. The clergyman opened his mouth, but Jenny quickly informed him that she did not think of including him in the arrangement.   -122      The Lost Rosary. a You had better go home, an' mind your business,' said her mother, very sharply. "I have no home to go to," answered the girl, with a sad tone in her voice. - Then go to your lodgings," sneered Miss Helen. The clergyman, finding that his happy evening was thus rudely broken in upon, told Mrs. Clarkson that he would retire for a little, as her daughters would very likely have private matters to speak about to her, and which another person should not be witness to. In order to reach a private room, the Reverend Eben- ezer Sookes had to pass the hall door, and while in the act of so doing, a third knock, sharp and thin, was heard, which caused a sensation of pain in the region of Eben- ezer's stomach. Mrs. Clarkson was by his side in a mo- ment, but the gentleman told her he would attend to the summnons himself, and that she might remain with her dear girls.

"'Twas quite a row, I do declare- The ladies tore each other's hair, And shrieked and fainted right away, At whlat they heard each other say." EBENEZER Sookes was a man of nervous temperament, a disability which he naturally ascribed to his female sur- roundings. For a long time he had debated with him- self whether he should have that useful appendage-a bell-pull attached to the outer door of his dwelling. He - was afraid of his nerves, but late experiences had taught him that the use of hard skinny knuckles, when applied to the door, was nearly as bad upon his delicate tympanr um as the startling sound of a bell. He had nearly set- tled the point, so long debated with himself, as he opened the door to the command of the last knuckles, and, to his astonishment, another lady made her appearance. "Good evening, Mr. Sookes," said the new comer. "Why, why, my dear, good Miss Longhow," exclaimed Mr. Sookes, c I amlso glad to see you; come in, come in; this way, please;" and Mr. Sookes, miserable Mr. Sookes most exquisitely miserable Mr. Sookes, led the way to his little private room.

' On-on-yourself, dear Ebenezer!" and Miss Long- blow endeavored to fall into the Rev. Ebenezer's arms. "How stupid I am," cried the gentleman, handing the lady to a seat. A slight noise, like a smothered cough, was heard at the door of the apartment, but no attention was paid to it, probably in consequence of the excited state of feel- ing of both parties. "I shall proceed at once to my sister," gasped Eben- ezer, like a drowning man catching at a straw to save himself. "Not for the world I " said Miss Longhow, grasping the arm of her companion ever so tightly, but imagining the act to be as gently performed as the touch of one rose leaf to another.

"Impudent Irish boor I " said Miss Longhow. "Vile Irish wretch," echoed Miss Sookes, the Jezebel forgetting all about the vixen, and the vixen all about the Jezebel. And what are we all but Irish?" naively inquired poor Jenny Clasldson. "Hould yer tongue, huzzy" saidher mother. "Ain't this awful?" said Afiss Sookes to Miss Long- bowl as these ladies departed, virtuously hating each other, but both agreeing as to the " awful" state of mat- ters in the Rev.

McGloue for permission   The Lost Rosary.       127 to occupy the room with Nelly. This she at once ob- tained, and Jenny Clarkson was thankful for the change. Finding her situation in the shoe-store likely to be per- manent, Jenny had gone to a boarding-house, and, for a few months, had lived a life of misery and temptation. She was surrounded on all sides by a set of female sharp- ers, whose conduct and language had terrified her into a train of thought unusual to her, and, for the first time since she had left Ireland, the full force of her lonely sit- uation burst upon her, and caused the poor thing to in- dulge reflections the opposite of those her previous gid- dy nature had imposed upon her. Finding her mother and elder sister treat her father's death so lightly as they did, it is not to be wondered at that one of her tender years should have been rendered thoughtless by the ex- ample of those so near to her. Since her entry under the roof of Mrs. McGlone, and especially since her com- panionship with little Nelly Nonlan, Jenny Clarkson be- came a changed girl. She had been to Church with Moll Hanley, quite regularly, too, for some time; and latterly, the disposition of the girl tended to the desire of bring- ing her mother and sister to the same belief with here self in regard to their living together. It was that which induced her to visit her mother; and the sorrow she ex- perienced at the result of that visit, had well-nigh brok- en the poor thing's heart; and, but for the comforting assurances of Moll Hanley, " that when one does their 'best in everything, they may rest satisfied, and leave the rest in the hands of God," she would certainly have lost all hope. Jenny rehearsed to Moll Hanley and Mrs. McGlone the whole particulars of what she had learned during her visit at the house of the Rev. Ebenezer Sookes. "The Lord be 'atween us an! harm, but did you ever hear the like?" said Moll, to Mrs. McGlone. "Is it hear the like o' that story l" said Mrs. McGlone; goodness save you from the knowledge of worse."   128       The Lost Rosary. "I tell you what" continued Moll Hanley, " that house that Jenny Clarkson has left is a perfect 'monium of hell. How them two blackguards that keep that place ever ex- pect to enter the presence of God, is more nor I can ever imaoine. A man calling himself a clergyman" main- tained Moll Hanley-whose notions of American morality were necessarily imperfect, owing to her slight knowl-  edge of the place-" to have so many'characters' about him!" "That's as common as dish-water," urged Moll's com- panion. "The rale evil an' injury to God's craters here is them other vagabon' women, who watch every corner of a street for poor greenhorn girls, who maybe only want to know the number of a door, an' then decoy the friendless bein's into some hole of a basement, where, if tile victim isn't beyond everything in stren'th of body an' mind, a black curse falls on her in twenty-four hours af- ter she enters l" and the speaker kept wringing her hands, as if the thoughts then coursing through her mind were beyond endurance. "But isn't there law an' justice for punishin' the vil- lains?' inquired Moll. "Law an' justice of a kind, to be sure there is," an- swered Mrs. McGlone; " but do you forget, woman dear, the kin' o' place this same New York is, with its hun- dreds an' thousands o' people landin' every other day, and the poor things, some o' them, without a penny or a friend, God help them, an' glad to take sarvice any- where; an' it's right into the lion's den they walk some- times, where they're drugged an' stupefied into insensi- bility, an', after a while, become dead lost to every -sense o' shame. What is there left them but the streets ever after?-an' it's them that goes their len'ths when they do fall; sure they're worse nor common, an' them tryin' to drown the thought o' what they were before. O keep us from ever knowin' what they come through!" fervent- ly ejaculated the speaker.   - "v v Uvo Hr-/votyw.  129 Moll mranley as horrified, and appealed to Mrs. c- Glone if she hadn't overstepped the limits of truth In her general portraiture of the pitfalls made for poor Ilish "It's as true as I'e tould you, an' worse nor anybody knows about" added Mrs. McGlone. ' Imspakin', Moll Hanley, from the experience ol the poor victims them- selves," she continued, "an what can be truer than" that?" atoll mournfully nodded assent. "Don't you mind ould McKeoun's young daughter Aggie? i' inquired the plain-spoken Mrs. -McGlone. "The young fair-haired girl? )' responded Moll. "No; that was her sister, Who's in heaven, I hope." I know the one you mane-the youngest of the faiiily." "Yes, that was Aggie. Well, that poor girl led a most miserable life after she came out here. She got into a dacent family, an' was no ctime till she took up with ac- qutintances who led her a wild race." So much for evil companions, as I told Jennlly Clark- son the other day," said Moll. "Just so. An' if she had taken her mistress' advise, it's happy an' dacent she would have been but she didn't, an' the worst of all ruins happened her. At first she went out o' nights; thei' to them low dancin' saloons -pits o' hell, I calls them; then she began to thieve, was put away from her dacent home, went as a bar-maid into a low den, an' before ten weeks, that girl, come o' dacent people, was, a public strumpet on the streets-an' all through gaddin' about, an' settina her heart on duds o' finery. Och! God look on them that haven't the firm hand to guide them. Sure we never can be thankful enough that so many escape the allurements of the devil." "That's true, echoed Moll, mournfully, who soon 9   130       The Lost Rosary. found out that her estimate of evil in the Rev. Ebenezer Sooke's house was small in comparison to what she had just learned. Alas! there was too much truth in the rehearsed expe- riences of Mrs. McGlone. Pitfalls for the innocent and unwary are too common, not only in New York, but in most of the large cities of America. Not more in pro- portion to other places, probably, but certainly more dangerous, in consequence of those most likely to be af- fected being utter strangers in such places, and recog- nising in the voices of the tempters the patois of their own language. That, and the kindly offer of some friend- ly act-base art of hell's agents-too often succeed in leading astray the wearied heart of youth. Let it not be imagined that those who thus trade upon the inex- peri-ence of female emigrants, are themselves debased children of Erin. In some instances they may be; in the majority of cases they are not; but their opportuni- ties for acquiring Irish habits of speech, and learning points of Irish character, are such as to enable them to successfully impose on artless people. The soft-spoken word, the proffered help, the kind in- quiry, touch the emigrant's heart to the quick, and ex- poses him, or her, to the well-laid schemes of the land- sharks. There are those in New York City, who. by practice, have become such adepts in deception, that they are fit to recognize, by the sound of the emigrant's voice, what particular county in Ireland he belongs to, and who use the same dialect, when addressing the new-comer, so successfully, as utterly to deceive the emigrant. Even this should not be sufficient to throw one off their guard; but it often does, and great evils follow.   The Lost Rosary.       131 CHAPTER XIX. MARY AND  ATr. I LAND I  AM  RA-   .  EXPERIENCE. "Behold them in the Promised Land, Where fairest flowers by zephyrs fanned Make sweet the air , AFTER Ailey O'Donnell's return to good health,she and lary found themselves poor indeed. The little funds they possessed were gone, and all their extra cloth- ing disposed of to meet their small equirements. Small requirements, indeed, for both girls managed to pass through that period of distress on an allowance that would, at least should, make many of their sex shamed of themselves,--those o  f them ....r sex ashamed of themselves,-those .of them, especially, who consider their chief duties of life to consist in spending mon ey, and who seem incapable of any thought above theirmis- erable self-love and vanity. Ailey was the first to find employment. and the poor girl's joy at that same was unbounded. She wished to prove her devotion to Mary, as if that were necessary for all the care bestowed upon her du ring her illness. Ailey's employer happened to be a gentleman of exel- lent character, and when he heard the history of the two girls, told them if they had their minds made up on em- igrating, he would pay their passage money. Such good news nearly upset Ailey. She maintained she felt twice as strong; and Mary, too, felt a thrill of new life come over her. Their hearts yearned toward   132      The Lost Hoscary. America, for, was not Barney there, and Tim, too? and, although no word had been heard from them lately, were not the chances in favor of something being learned concerning them when 'L one's on the ground," as Ailey remarked. The great mass of the people, when thinking of Amer- ica, do so with very circumseribedideas. They still keep thinking of their own parish, their own townland, or their own county; forgetting, or, rather, not knowing that they might be in the same State with friends for a lifetime, and never know it; nay, that they might hap- pen to be residents of the same city, and never see each other., Still, both Ailey and Mary believed that once in Amer- ica, they would -not be long in discovering the where-i abouts of Barney and Tim. Their wish-is gratified I Behold them standing on one of the New York piers. Ten weary weeks they passed on sea; scarcely daring to speak during that time, ex- cept to each other, and keeping together night and day for mutual protection. The ship they sailed in was a floating hell. Immorality stalked abroad in; daylight, as well as at night-time, in that little world, contaminat- ing many innocent hearts, overshadowing some as with a pall, worsea thousand times worse, than death in its most cruel form, and disgusting others with the loath- some conduct seen and practised among so many. The ship in which Mary and Ailey had taken their passage, sailed from Liverpool, -faking a large number of those who had been kept behind for several weeks, in conse- quence of the vessel in which they intended to leave be- ing overcrowded. .Some had been two weeks, others three, walking idly about in that city of dissipation, and having no friend to guide them, but, on the contrary be- ing exposed to every wile and to every evil character, were in that short space of time initiated into evils and   JL wt jOvs uiosary.      133 vices they had never known before. Recklessness set in, and resulted in misconduct such as only a few weeks ago the guilty ones would have blushed at. True, their suf- ferings and misery were manifold and severe; but those who break down at such hours of trial, are unworthy of the responsibility they take upon themselves; and better would it have been for them if they had lived and died in poverty at home, than face those dangers they were not competent to withstand. One enemy faced them at everyturn. Drink maddened them - cursed them, polluted them, and stopped not till their souls were plunged into the deepest abyss of sin! Then drink, like an unyielding tyrant, kept them sur- rounded by the misery it had created, and the unfortu- nate beings thus circumstanced landed in the New World beggars, and readyfor the commission of any- thing that would give them drink. That was their bap- tism of fire - fire that consumes all it touches - on en- tering their new life. The number of those who thus lost self-respect was comparatively small; but only a few of the vicious class are required to contaminate many, when all classes .are thrown  together and mixed in disorder on board an emigrant ship. It is just to infer that neither Mary nor Ailey would have ventured into this social pest-house, could they have foreseen the misery they were compelled to endure. Their conduct was dignified, and commanded respect even from the vicious. At first, their ears were assailed with immodest remarks about themselves, but they heed- ed not what they heard, and never attempted a remon- strance or a reply. That was their safeguard, and they found it to be also their comforter. The attacks of im- modest tonigues soon ceased, and the poor virtuous girls had comparative peace. It is worthy of remark, that Mary never alluded to these things even to her cousin,   134      The Lost Rosary. while Ailey, the lihthearted, was equally as silent con- cerning them. They certainly gathered strength in each other's company; but it was the strength of grace, the strength that springs from rectitude that was their sup- port, and God knows they required all they possessed. To Iiave spoken even in terms of condemnation of what they saw a-nd heard, would, in some way, have defled them -would have tarnished the innate beauty of their souls, which, after all, can, if we but try, remainasspot- les as polished gems even when our bodies are surround- ed by vice in its deadliest form. Mcattes conpetead with the emigrant ship are much changed now, because the emigrant ship scarcely exists; and even where it does, the system of vigilance is much improved. Nevertheless, there are still daners to be apprehended to the virtuous, even under the best regu- lations on board, but these are comparatively few. For the viciously inclined, opportunities are not wanting, but, on the whole, there is safety for the unprotected. but, on  s the prhole ctos ea an espeOially It isessential at all times, that females, and especially those who are ygoung and unused to mix with uncertain classes of people, should, if they wish to avoid bad co- sequences, conduct themselves as did, ary and Ailey O'Donnell. Silence is good, when to speak might in- duce irregular conversation, but, as a rule, cheerfulness and good nature, without forwardness or boldness, will earry the best through the ordeal of emigration, and be- get kindness and protection in return. With the tears trembling on her eyelids, Thaty O'Don- nell gazed on the ship she had just left. That look spokevolumes. The long-heaved sigh bespoke a release from anguish of mind and suffering of body. "Just a penny, for God's sake," said an old crone, ad- dressing A-ileY.             u h The girl's hand was instantly in her pocket, ad the womaul's request was s00o complied with.   iL n we LjOS a r osary.   1I0 T That box beside yee's, will be your luggage, I'm think- in," continued the beggar-woman, while she pocketed the coin from 1C the good ould country." "Yes," answered Mary; and then addressing Ailey, said, c This poor creature would likely be able to direct us to a decent place to go to, for a few days." "Is it a dacint place yer spakin' of, sure then, it's me- self that will direct yee's?" said the old woman, at the same time calling a young man, and directing him to "take up that trunk at wanst, and take the pupty girls, God bless 'em, right away to Paddy Farren's comfortable lodgin'-house."  The person spoken to did as directed, and, thanking the old woman, Mary and Ailey followed the carrier. They were soon installed in their new quarters, and received a good deal of extra. attention from the keeper of the boarding-house. Toward nightfall, a fiddler "dropped in ;" then an acquaintance or two, young men and young women, who had all the appearance of not being over a couple of months in the country. Mary was quick. to perceive that she had fallen into a trap. She communicated her fears to Ailey, who also felt dis- contented with the place. "To remain here for to-night would make it more dif- ficult to leave in the morning," urged Mary. "That I agree to, at once," said Wiey; 1; and we must seek a remedy without further waiting. Just you re- main in while I take a walk outside to cast my eyes about me." Mary agreed, but not without some misgiving. It was necessary that one of them should remain to watch their baggage, and, after cautioning her cousin to note well the direction she would take, Ailey departed on her first little mission of business in the New World. She moved quickly about, knowing that to stand anxiously looking round her would be sure to attract attention. It was   136      The Lost Rosary. not a great business, after all, that Ailey engaged in, yet she prayed most fervently. Her loneliness of heart led her to ask for help and guidance. Sneer at it, worldings! That poor girl did pray earnestly, and besought God to guide her steps. And she succeeded. In less than an hour, Ailey returned in company with two tolerably strong women, and Mary's heart got "as light as a feather." The girls had been but a short time, indeed, in their new quarters; yet they were charged for that short time at a rate that few hotels would venture upon aslidg, But poor-looking people are seldom wel- comed to hotels, and seldom care about patronizing even second-class places of the kind. Shall we dare to write it again    uld Mary O'Donnell, too, had prayed that iley would suc- ceed in finding some place "where theymight rest them- selves after their weary voyage." "Just take that side o' the trun," said the stouter of the women, addressing her companion," an' follow us," she added, nodding to Mary and Ailey. The girls did so with a sense of relief The stout woman was no other than our friend, Moll Hanley, and her companion was Mrs. MicGlone. In a short time Mary and Ailey were seated comforta bly in company with their new friends, and rehearsing not a few incidents of the voyage now happily termin- ated "Oh, then, glorybe to Godl But ye had the narrow i escape from that den o' thieves," said Moll Hanley, affec- I tionately addressing the girls. "But what in all the world tempted you to put a foot into sich a place?" iley recounted their interview with the old woman after they had landed. "Oh, the ould, ensnarin' divil! how can she expect to get to heaven after all the evil she does be doinl'?" said Moll, as she clasped her hands and raised her eyes.   The Lost Rosary.       137 "Then, God knows, you both had an escape " said Mrs. McGlone, whose heart beat kindly towards Mary and Aliley. "That house o' Farren's is one o' the worst in the whole City of New York. The lowest, vilest class o' characters attend it. They ensnare young men, as well as young women, into every vice, and that, too, before they're very long on American soil." "The place can't be good," said Mary; "and I saw it would never do to spend our first night within its walls." "An' now may I ask you," said Moll, looking towards Ailey," how you thought of comin' in here? But sure it must have been chance, just, that directed you." "Not altogether chance,"  replied Ailey. "I passed your door, I'm sure, half a dozen times before I entered. I observed there were no men lounging about, and, as I peered into the window, I saw a picture of the Virgin hanging on the wall; and the wall itself was the whitest I had seen; and there was an air about the place that won upon me, and, in fact, I was just smart enough to see that the place was suitable." Now Ailey gave her reasons very pertly, and very correctly, for one who was destined for some time to bear the ridiculous name of " greenhorn." She believed she had made a good selection of a place, and wished, if it turned out as deserving as it appeared, to notice what caught her eye, so that the two women in charge of it, knowing what a stranger thought of its appearance, might take the hint and improve on what they heard,   138       The Lost Rosary. CHAP'TER XX. A SAD PICTUJ2E---WH AT MA  ND A TTrY ESCAPED. "'Twas a place of sin and crime, Where deeds were done that never will be known Till the earth dissolves, and nothing leaves To hide their great deformity." "AN' what's come o' the two young ones I sent you?" inquired the beggar-woman, as she entered Paddy F ar- ren's, and failed to recognize the whereabouts of Ailey and Mary, whom she believed were safely in the clutches of her employer. "How do I know?" said the owner of the house, in a tone of displeasure, and with a gruffness and coarseness of manner that was most repelling. "Ye let them slip nicely, I'm thinkn', after me watch- in' them afore their foot touched the ground." "Hould yer prate, and be d--d to you. They weren't half as green as ye took them to be," was the ill-natured reply. "An' couldn't ye have made them green enough, Paddy, had ye been so mindin', an' not have deprived me o' the chance o' one o' them, at laste, as a waitin' maid in the place, ye know?" urged the woman, with a sense of her disappointment, and in a callous and hardened man- ner, that was enough to thrill the blood of any one who knew her meaning. "Aye, like enough, ye wud have had a chance o' your tin dollars, ye divirs chick, if ye had got your hands on them."   'The Lost Rosary.   '   . 139 llDivil's chick, here or there, I worked for ye, an' ye lost the game; but, I suppose ye thought their swag too light, or ye would have managed to have kept them for wun night itself," urged this female touter, whose tem- per was nothing improved at being deprived of the op- portunity of trying her hand on the unwary girls thus mercifully rescued from her clutches. "Git out o' that, an'go to the divil, ye harmagan, or, by the holy ---, I'll sind yer rotten carcass into a dozen piers!" said Farren, roused by the taunts of the woman. "Pay me, thin, every fardin' o' what ye owe me, an' it's transferrin' me sarvices I'll be to wan that'llgive an ould crater like me a chance o' earnin' a dollar extra, when I bring him in a pair o' as purty girls, fresh and bloomin', as- iver crossed a threshold." This threat, although a thing of very common occur- rence among touters and their employers, contained within it a. sting that mortified Farren, and, without an- other word, he caught the old woman by the throat, and fung her heavily on the floor. The place was half-filed with a miscellaneous company, and not one of those present ever thought of the slightest interference. There was a party of four or five dissipated loafers engaged at a card-table, and, turning an innocent amusement into a gambling practice, were cursing each other's souls to perdition with a heartiness of profanity that was perfect- ly appalling. Here, another batch of a like number were drinking, and recounting their experiences of the day. Such occurrences as a blow and a fall were common in those places; and, as it was expected that every keeper of a like house, if not licensed to sell drink, was licensed to prove his brutal nature in whatever manner suited his temper, the altercation between Farren and the old woman caused no more stir than if it had not hap- pened. The victim of Farren's outrage laystunned and stupid;   "O      The Lost Rosary. and believing her to be acting a part, as usual under similar circumstances, he approached her, and, with an oath that is better not repeated, kicked her with his heavy boot. The woman groaned, and blood came from her lips. Farren went out, and in a few minutes return- ed with a policeman. He desired him to remove "the . ould baste out o' that," and, as a preparatory aid, half filled a tumbler with whiskey, and handed it to the con- servator of the peace, who drank it off at a gulp. The poor wretch was roughly huddled out of doors, and Far- ren, after repeating the whiskey trick' to quiet his con- science and soothe his nerves, took his place at the card table, with the remark that " it wasn't fair to sit there all night without some benefit to the house." "Give us half-a-pint, then, to begin with," said one of the party, who, being the largest winner, was expected to " stand treat for all hands," for it was one of the un- derstood rules of that establishment "to keep the up- standin' of the house" before the eyes of all and sun- dry who visited there; which, in other words, meant that willing, or unwilling, the poor dupes whose calling was in every sense a crime, must drink the poison vend- ed by Farren, under the name of whiskey-and heaven only knows the number and nature of the crimes which owe their inception and commission to the "drink" disposed of by the class of which Farren is the type. During the night, parties entered and left that house of infamy at pleasure. Prostitutes came there, in com- pany with men of their own class; at other times they might have been seen inveigling and enticing youths of tender years, under the disguise of recommending them to a place of safety and comfort for the night. Few who entered as strangers came forth without loss of vir- tue; others were robbed directly, or made to spend their money freely, which they often did in order to make   The Lost Rosary.       141 friends with the rough-looking cut-throats who fre- quented the place. Cards containing directions to strangers were suspended, here and there, displaying words like the following:- "Drink freely, act friendly, Pay kindly, and call again." And yet, with all this evidence of drink sold and used every day and every night, without a proper license, that place and thousands of a like kind are permitted up till the present to exist in New York, in open defiance of the law, and to the disadvantage of the decent, honest trad- er. And this was the first house entered by Mary and Ailley I How many such might they not have entered in New York? Alas too many. Too many where the temptations to sin were better concealed; where the fall from virtue is graduated; where brutal violence is not practised in the open manner such as we have witnessed in Paddy Farren's. This man was an Irishman, carelessly reared. His mother died when he was yet a child, and the cruelty of a stepmother brought forth only the evil qualities, of character, while whatever remained to him of good was permitted to become barren and useless. He emigrated to America, after having run the gauntlet of vice and crime at home, and feeling no disposition to look for work, or the means of living honestly, he gave himself over to low, coarse indulgences; and when he became proprietor of a boarding-house, believed he had gained the summit of earthly prosperity. Often and again he intended to reform his life, but he never tried sincerely to do so. Business at first did not prosper with him sufficiently to enable him to " make ends meet," and one day, when gloomily reflecting on these things, he swore, "By the living Holy G--," that he would make dollars, or know why. By that he meant, that under any circum-   "2      The Lost Rosary. stances he would acquire money, and money he did ac- quire; but somehow there seemed to be a burning curse sticking to every dollar of his ill-gotten gains. There was no profligacy, no matter how bad, that he did not permit and encourage. Why pursue the sad history of that man any further? He writhed with bitter agony at losing his yew lodg- ers, not for what money he might have gained by their temporary presence, but at the thought of a fresh victim rescued from his lust, and made profitable as a money speculation afterwards. Poor Mary! poor Ailey! weak, powerless, and inno- cent! Ye little knew that the hour when ye offered your- selves to Raphael, the Guardian Angel, and besought his care during your voyage on the Atlantic, was the happi- est of your lives. Dark and dismal seemed your pros- pects; but the dangers you escaped aye, what of them? Would that we always thought of what we have es- caped. Therein we could more readily comprehends the goodness of the Hand that protects us. But dangers past and unseen have seldom any terrors. 'Mary and Ailey O'Donnell did not fully comprehend the nature of the danger that threatened them. They felt they had been saved from the evils of a place they did not like, and were thankful on that account. Had they known the exact nature of these evils, there were not two hearts in the universe would have expanded more gratefully, humbly and thankfully to God, and to the resplendent Angel whose protection they sought, than those two good IrtIsH GIRLS. There are many, very many, species of evil our Irish girls know not. They have been reared tenderly, al- though, in too many instances, poorly. But their pover- ty, and even their ignorance, where the latter exists, are blessings of incomprehensible value, if we venture on drawing a comparison between these and other miseries   'ne iJost iosary.       143 too common among those of their sex in large cities. The blissful ignorance of Irish girls in matters pertain- ing to the worldly and carnal-minded, is a thing to feel grateful for, although there are some to be found who prefer the indulgence of passion and vanity to the pres- ervation of the soul's delightful purity. Even in a world- ly sense, girls who give themselves over to a paltry in- dulgence of tawdry dress, loss of time, when the time is legitimately their own, to the neglect of duties, are seldom admired by those whose admiration is worth anything. Modesty and retirement catch men's eyes much more than bold and forward conduct; and, while the latter may insure a season of successful flirting, they very sel- dom terminate in a prudent and happy marriage. Some of the best marriages that ever, were solemnlized in the world, were those where the young woman had never kept an hour's private company with her intended hus- band,--had never " shown herself off" at ball or party,-- and would rather have run the hazard of displeasing even by the breaking off of the marriage engagement, than venture into the precincts of temptation. These are the women who are virtuous for virtue's sake; these are the mothers fitted to rear wise daughters and brave manly sons--the very life of an empire, the ornaments of the: Church, and the builders-up of our civilization. Their progeny are not the insipid, idiotic creatures that make a shine like a bit of paste jewelry, and equally as worthless. They are the women who give birth to great men; for it is true of all times and places, that great men have had great, good mothers. Our Irish girls should bear these things in mind, as they are valuable, not only in themselves, but for other virtues to which they are closely alied. For instance, a modest girl, who has no pretension to vain and worth- less show, is sure to be an honest girl. She does not en- courage a taste for things beyond her reach, and thereby   "4       The Lost Rosary. indirectly she fortifies herself against all temptations to dishonesty. The girl who is retiring in her conduct, and does not make it her study to court attraction, has fewer temptations toward improprieties, which, although in- nocent and common enough in the beginning, generally terminate in ruin to soul and body. 'As the practise, therefore, of one solid virtue begets many others, so the indulgence of one passion makes the road easy for others to follow. A disposition for spending time idly, although the spare hours properly belong to us, and not to our employers, is too often the gateway to ruin, and should always be carefully avoided.  ,        .

MARY  1lCuS A PLACE-AILETT S DESIRE FOR WORK-- MOLL HAtNLEY THE COMFORTEIR "A heart full of kindness she had, Eor all who were friendless and poor, And it never was said of our Moll, That a creature was turned from her door." WnHER little Jenny Clarkson came to know that Mary and Ailey were to be her boarding-house companions, she thought she would have died with joy. "It was as good as a play," said Moll Hanley,-" to see the meetin' between  the children." Yes, only that the acting was natural, hearty, and truthful. Jenny Clark- son perfectly screamed with delight. She had always borne a good feeling towards Mary and Ailey, but her mother forbade her to keep their company, not "being fit society for her daughters!" But times were changed, since then, and it was quite within the bounds of   probability, that Mrs. Clarkson would have accepted the company of almost any one for her daughters. The widow was beginning to realize the uncertainty of her position in the house of the Rev. Ebenezer Sookes. Miss Longhow and Ebenezer's sister were very much displeased with the Rev. gentleman for continuing  "that woman" in his employment. Mrs. Clarkson saw all these displays so unfriendly in her re- gard, and she dreaded a change even in the Rev. Ebene- zer's conduct toward her. Willingly, therefore, had she 10   "O       X BIe -Dost wosary. known it, would Mrs. Clarkson have been, to find her daughter Jenny associated with the daughter and niece of her old neighbor. But she did not know of their ar- rival; and Moll Hanley had prevailed on Jenny to make her visits as few as possible to " that strange house, where the Rev. Naiser Nooks and his women were etar- nally gabblin' and groanin' about things that lneer a one o' them understood."  Jenny had full faith in the warnings of Moll Tanley, and strictly adhered to her advice. She had found it to be good, and had proved the devotion of her caretaker, who was more to her than her own mother. Mrs. McGlone's establishment had prospered very well, and the success she had experienced made the good wo- man still further desirous of performing all the good within her reach. Little Nelly Noonan had brought home word of some vacancies in the warehouse where she was engaged. "An' is it to sarve under yer Miss Helen Clarkson," sneeringly asked Moll, " that you'd expect Mary or Ailey O'Donnell to so bemane themselves? No, Nelly. They may be hard up, poor things, but God Almighty didn't give me these pair o' arms for nothin'. I worked before, an' am able to work. again; an' there's more nor three score dollars in a place I know, an' the divil astep aither o' them will ever take that road, if I can prevent it." Both Mary and Alley expressed their thanks to the good-hearted, generous Moll, but thought there would. be no harm just in trying. They were anxious for em- ployment, and were willing to try anything for a begin- ting. Moll replied very positively. She had it in contempla- tion, she said, to get some other place for little Nelly. She didn't like " the consarn by any manner o' means," and would much rather Mary and Alley would wait a while. "There was better things in store for them, if   ..... Rv ' a u- 14'7 they just patiently 'bided their time, an' made themselves comfortable, an' gave themselves no annoyance., "But for a beginning insisted Mary. Ad then i is s    o pleaant to be employed," urged Alley. "And I would give anything to have them near me," quietly remarked Nelly Noonan. Jenny Clarkson just then entered, and broughtthe in- telligence that her sister had left her place, and had gone to another situation provided for her by the Rev. Ebene- zer Sookes.# "O, just come to-morrow morning,' said Nelly Noonan, addressing Mary, "and I'm sure you'll get the place." "Well, that alters the barcumstanees very much," said Moll. "I can finderstan' your goin' now an' tryin', she added, with a satisfied look at her proteges; "but yees wouldn't have had anypace nor contentment under-I mane, yees wouldn't have liked to work with Nelly Clark- son as your mistress." Moll felt that she ought to speak, if not kindly, at least. not altogether as she felt, towards "Helen"Clark- son, in presence of Jenny. Next morning saw Mary and Ailey present themselves as applicants for employment, in the establishment re- cently presided over by Jenny 's sister. Mary obtained leave to enter on trial, but the other vacancies had been filled, and Ailey was not successful. The poor girl was downcast, and felt sorrowfu I enough. She knew well that between herself and h er cousin there was but one purse; one will seemed to govern them both; but now Mary was absent during the day, and that left Alley too much time at her disposal, and so she began to indulge in thoughts of a cheerless character. There is scarcely any trial greater than enforced idle- ness, to one who desires to work in order to earn a de- Den; livelihood, as well as for-love of work in itself.   "8      Thle Lost Rosary.          a Then Ailey's mind would revert to Tim, and she won- dered if Mary thought as much about Barney. One night after Mary's return from work, Ailey, who had been more than ordinarily desponding during the day, told her that she had formed the resolution of go- ing out and seeking for employment. Mary was distressed, but kindly inquired what kind of employment she would look for? "Anything I can get, dear cousin-no matter what, provided it be decent," answered Alley. "That place of mine appears to be suitable enough,? and I have little doubt that shortly you may obtain a post there," urged Mary, desirous of breaking Ailey's res- olution, and prevent a separation. "But it is so tedious waiting, and the uncertainty makes the trial greater, dear Mary; so that, after weigh- ing the matter over in my mind, I liave resolved to look about for a place. You know I may not succeed,". quietly remarked the girl, " and then I'll have to burden you as I am doing at present,' she added. ' To separate now, after all we have gone through and suffered together, is neither wise nor kind," promptly re- plied Mary, with the least tinge of disappointment in her voice. Now Ailey, with all her good qualities, was not alto- gether ingenuous in this little proceeding. She had in- directly learned that Mary was deceived as to the exact cost of providing for both in the boarding-house, and she had a strong suspicion that Moll Hanley had ar- ranged with Mrs. McGlone to keep the matter secret for "just a wee while longer." Ailey did not like to- make known what she knew under this head, and one of her reasons was, lest Mary should ask her the very pertinent question, How she came to know? It may be as well to state, that Ailey had learned as much from Nelly Noonan and Jenny Clarkson as enabled her to form her judg- ment correctly.   'Th e Lost Rosary.      149 Very few girls would have given themselves any con- cern in such things, seeing that they were so warmly welcomed by all alike. Not so Ailey O'Donnell. She dreaded idleness as a great temptation. She found that want of regular employment encouraged her to indulge in thinking and she always felt dissatisfied with herself after a lengthened indulgence of that sort. Perhaps Ailey scarcely ever said as much, and might not have cared to have the state of her mind made known, but cousin Mary knew her nature intimately. "I'm sure you do not speak after reflection," said Aley, "if you consider me as acting either unwisely or "I didn't mean it in that sense," M3aryquickly replied, and bbth girls were for a while silent. "However," exclaimed the last speaker, "if you have made up your mind to go-- " "Mary, you do me an injustice," sobbed Ailey, and the tears flowed from her eyes. "You know I have no desire, no' disposition to leave you, nor to part fi'rom you, even for a day. God help me, and pity me," continued the hearthroken girl, with her eyes and hands raised towards heaven. "Say no more, dear cousin," urged Mary. Our lot is, indeed, hard enough to bear. I'm sure you will not think worse of me   for my little selfishness in what I have urged. We are lonely and friendless, and except for these good women, our change into this part of the world would be hard indeed to bear." Afoll Hanley made her appearance just then. It was just possible that she heard the last remarks, for she ap- peared very kind-looking to both girls, and, without any apparent cause, began laughing, and used every exertion to make both Mary and Ailey as cheerful-as herself. Good, kind, Moll Hanley! Many, nay, the greater part of the wise humanity of the world would have passed you   150       The Lost Rosary. by as a very common sort of person. But this story, which is truthful in every line, must do you more justice than the said wise humanity would have done you, or any of your class or character. Moll Hanley had a good deal of unseen wisdom about her, and knew as much by her intuitive perception as many others would have learned from direct causes. Long before that night she had properly judged Ailey's disposition, and loved the girl for her hatred of idleness. Moll was a romping good worker herself, and relished the same in others. Her heart seldom shone in the fulness of its beauty and goodness. That was an exposure of too much hidden treasure, which Moll did not like to make before the world. Whenever she was afraid of be- ing extra-kind or good-natured, poor Moll used to pull down her brows, or try to do it, which was worse than if she had succeeded, and, in an assumed gruff voice, would " spake her sintiments jist as natur' taught her;" but any one, with the least pretension to sharpness, might have easily perceived under this the beauty of a kindly disposed nature, a warm and generous heart, that made Moll Hanley a perfect woman, and that is saying a good deal for her. "There's trouble here, an' plenty of it too, that's plain," said Moll, for a beginning. "Now, there you are, both o' you enjoyin' a hundred blessin's that many a one in your state niver knew a bit about. Only a short while in the new country, and not over an hour in Pat Far- ren's house. Troth it's a rale shame you might think o' yourselves, so it is, to be lamentin', an,' maybe, flyin' in the face o' Providence ye'll be afther doin', that guarded ye, as few have ever been guarded before." "But it's not my fault, indeed, Moll," began Mary; "I was only remonstrating---" "To be sure, now. That'll do, sure; it's all our faults, to be sure it is."   Tlhe Lost Rosary.        151 "The fault, whatever there's of it, is all mine," said Ailey; "but I'm sure---  " "There now, that'll do for both o' you, I say," perempt. orily added Moll. A few words sufficed to show the kind-hearted crea- ture how matters really stood, and to Ailey's great relief Moll sided with her, and Mary was quite reconciled, if not altogether satisfied, to the proposed change. It was ar- ranged that Ailey might seek for employment, but not to accept any situation that would deprive the cousins of meeting, at least on Sundays. "And now that we have that all settled, allow me just to sit here for a little, till I show you a parable that might make yees thankful to God and His Blessed Moth- er, forescapin' sickness and trouble, and maybe worse, an' poverty, after all, into the bargain." Mary and Ailey were anxious to hear, and as they felt thoroughly reconciled to each other, wished Moll to pro- ceed. Moll filled her pipe, preparatory to relating what she termed "A lesson for them that's willin' to learn."   152       The Lost Rosary. CHAPTER X   . x I . MOLL HANLEY'S STORY. "A picture of grief, sin. and shame, For a curse she had brought on her name." "LET me see," said Moll, with her head averted a little to the side. "It's now somewhere over one-and-twenty years ago since there lived a pretty girl named Alice McGrain. Her father, God be good to him, was a fine man, but very hasty in his temper. He had a wife- well, the least said the soonest mended; an' if we can't spake well o' the dead, we must jist keep quiet-at any rate, Attie McGrain's wife didn't rear her daughter as she might, an' before Alice was twelve years ould, her mother died, leavin' a purty large family o' young childer after her. Alice was the ouldest, an' her father bein' purty well to do, had her kept at school when she should have been at home attendin' to her brothers and sisters. That's the truth I tell you, for I mind it well. So, my dears, the girl got to think it would never be day with her, an' it's high enough she held her head, I tell ye. Her father used to be delighted with her, especially of a Sunday, when the weather was fine, an' she out walkin' an' visitin'., She was scarcely come eighteen when bad stories were circulated about poor Alice, an' of course they reached the father s ears, an' at first he got into a fearful temper. So one day, when the thing be- gun to dawn on his mind, off he marched, an' wasn't seen for six long days; then he returned, an' any   The Lost Rosary.        153 one who knew him before wouldn't have known him then, he was so awfully changed. He had gone to a dis- tant part of the country to see his brother, an' sure enough, he got to take the drink, an' was nearly dead afore he stopped it. However, as I'm tellin' yees, back he came, an'- as it was gettin' evidenter every day, that Alice wasn't a bit belied,-- so what does he do, thought- less man, but off he went, purchased a passage ticket for Ameriky, an' packed her off." "But what had she done?" inquired Ailey,who was all attention. "Jist wait awhile an' ye'll hear," said Moll. "She landed in Ameriky, an' the third day after, she gave birth to a fine child. Well, as God was good, the poor innocent was baptized, an' died the same day." "That, indeed, was a blessing," interrupted Mary. "Yes, my child, you may say that," continued Moll. "It was a blessin', jist one o' these blessin's that no one can tell the value of. Alice went distracted at the thought of her child bein' taken from her; an' I'm tould by them that saw it, that it took two men to lift her off the little coffin, an' her screams were so awful that near- ly everybody ran away. She would have killed herself if she hadn't been well watched, for she often threatened to put an ind to her own life. As it was, she took the fever, an' for two long weeks she didn't know scarce where she was. She was removed to an hospital, and got every sort o' good care. When she began to recover, she was like any ghost, an' nobody that ever saw her be- fore, would have known her then. However, to pass that over, she got quite well, and was turned out o' the place. One of the doctors who had known her, recommended her to a good situation, an' for five or six months she got on very well, and plazed her employers in everything she did. Her mistress, a good, kind-hearted Irish lady, knew a little of Alice's history, an' although she never   154   :   The Lost Rosary. allowed that knowledge to interfere with her goodness, still it made her, I dare say, keep a sharper eye on the girl's general conduct. An' sure, she wouldn't have been a lady at all, much less a good Irish woman, if she hadn't done that same. But poor, foolish Alice, couldn't see that a watchful eye was a -friend, an' so she got to dislike her home. "One evening Alice went out for a walk, as usual, and had two o' the childer with her, takin' care o' them, but mlsha, God bless us, it was the poor care she took o' them I She wasn't over half an hour gone, when she hap- pened to meet with an acquaintance, a young man that hadn't a bit o' a character to lose. Now, her mistress. had repeatedly cautioned her against all private meet- ings, especially with strangers; but,' out o' sight, out o' mind;' Alice didn't care a straw about who she met, so long as she wasn't seen." "One of the very worst things a young woman could be guilty of," said Mary, with particular emphasis in the tone of her voice. "A truer word never escaped your lips, dear," said Moll. "At any rate, the young man invited her into a saloon to trate her, an' Alice was nothin' loth to accept the offer. The two poor innocent childer were takenin, of course, an' my lady Alice was introduced to new ac- quaintances, an' so she sat there for nearly an hour." ATnd the poor innocent children seeing all the vice of the place," said Ailey. "Well, one o' them, at laste, wasn't much injured by bad impressions, any way," continued Moll. "What with the taste o' drink and the merry company, she paid little attention to her charge. - There she was, dear, sated on the young man's knee, an' she laughin' at the immod- est jokes that was spoken, an' jpinin' in the same herself. Oh! it was terrible to hear the account of it given by the young man who was a waiter in the place. All at once   The Lost Rosary.     .  155 there was heard the most awful scream that ever fell on a human ear. Every one in the saloon rushed out to the door, to see what it was, an,' God be good to us, there was the youngest child lyin' killed dead in the middle o' the street, an' its brains dashed all about. The poor little dear had been playin' about the door, and wandered into the middle o' the street, an' a big wagon was justpassin' at the time. The child saw its danger, an' the poor thing thought to get out o' the way, but it fell within half a yard o' one o' the wheels, an' its head was smashed into bits." Moll paused in her story, and covered her eyes with both hands, as she recalled the frightful scene. Mary and Ailey were terribly shocked, and could not keep back the tears that flowed in sympathy with Moll, and thinking; no doubt, at the time, of the sufferings of the kind master and mistress, who had committed the care of their children to so faithless a being. "You may guess the sad hearts the poor father and mother had," said Moll, " when their darlin' child was carried into them a corpse, an' a cloth over the poor thing's head, that couldn't be removed in presence of its mother, The good lady wasn't very strong, and the shock nearly killed her. For three long months she was confined to her room; an' it's often an' often her distracted husband thought his wife's life would pay the penalty of their misfortune. She was visited by the clergy an' the doctor every day; and after a while the unfortunate mother got roun' again, glory be to God, but she was never the same thing. The father's grief was just as bad, but he was a fine gentleman, an' his sufferin's were all buried deeply in his heart. So you see, it wasn't alone the unnatural death, o' the poor child that came as a punishment, but the sickness an' trouble that followed, for evil seldom comes alone." "And what was done to the girl?" eagerly inquired Moll's hearers.   156       The Lost Rosary. "Jist wait till ye see," replied Moll. "Her story was neatly got up: She was engaged runnming after the old- est of the childer at the corner where the accident oc- curred, an' while so doin', the youngest one attempted to cross the street. That was partly true, for, in the  hurry at the time, the oldest did, as Alice said, turn up a street, an' she had to follow her; but even it wasn't past four years' old, an' couldn't contradict the nurse. The crowd gathered so suddenly at the time the child was killed, that Alice was in the middle o' them in no time; an' after all that happened, she remained on in her place; both master an' mistress really believin' that the accident was none o' her fault, or, at least, that it did not arise from her bad conduct an' negligence. Alice was like one in a dream for a long time after the poor innocent thing was laid in its grave-Och! an'- sich a grave I and the weeney headstone--not the size o' that i" and Moll joined her hands together, to indicate the size of the little memorial erected over the grave, " an' jist two or three words on it-' OuR LITTLE ]3BRIDGET'-in a semi-circle.' Here Moll produced a small card and showed the above. "Why, as true as death, that's the same little head- stone, Ailey, that we saw last Sunday," exclaimed Mary. Ailey next examined the card Moll produced, and was startled at the coincidence. Both girls had taken a trip over to Long Island,and proceeded to the Catholic burying place on the Sunday previous. Ailey saw her own name on a tombstone. Mary saw the name of a dear friend of hers on another, and then both were attracted to a small grave, beautifully ornamented with shells and flowers. The little tablet, at the head of the grave, struck them as being singular, and during all that evening they could not help wondering at the simple announcement-"OUTB "TTLE BRIDGET."   Thle Lost Rosary.       157 - Then it's jist the self-same," continued Moll. "How- ever, as I was tellin' yees, Alice McGrain continued on in her place for over six months. But ye would jist have thought that a curse was about the house that con- tained her. Her mistress bein' so long ill, the master's business did not prosper, an' after awhile they had to give Alice her lave. Oh, the impidence o' that girl I She flew at her mistress like a vile thing, an' called her dread- ful names, an' raised such ructions that she had to be put out. She had kept up correspondin' with the young man in whose company she was the day .the child was killed, an' had arranged to get married to him in about a couple o' months after she was dismissed. God knows what damage she might have done before that time if she had the power; at any rate, she had to go to a boardin'-house, an' the young fellow quit her company afterwards. Now, strange as it may appear, it's a fact that the lady and gintleman began to thrive every day after that girl left the place. Many a time afterwards, she was seen in drinking saloons, an' dancin' places, an' finally she gave up all' thought o' herself, an' went clane to the bad.  She was a livin' scandal to any one that ever knew her."     , "Dear help her friends,"' said Mary, with much feel- ing. "Aye, God help them," said Moll; "an' now, my dear girls, listen: that girl was my own sister's daughter, an' it was to try if I could do anything with her that brought me to America. I saw her just twice, an' only spoke once to her, an' after all I learned I gave up the atr tempt." "  Then she 's living yet?" said Mary. "  Living, dear, yes," replied Moll, with a chokiig sensation  in her throat, "an' will, I hope, till God's good moment comes, if it ever comes. So make your mind easy, my   dear girl," said Moll, addressing Ailey;   158      The Lost Rosary. ' the want o' the bit o' work is unpleasant, but there are a thousand worse things than dependin' on a good friend like your cousin Mary there. Jist wait, in God's name, an' take everything smoothly an' quietly for, awhile, an' many a blessin' will come of it." -i "      i   The Lost Rosary.       159 CHAPTER X x i 1. . STRBNGE INCIDENT IN A GRBAVEYARD - bJIDING OF THE "ONG LOST ROSARY. "I've numbered these beads, By night and by day, And I know them with closed eyes, Whenever I pray." NEXT Sunday, Mary and Ailey felt irresistibly inclined to pay another visit to the graveyard, to look at the little grave. They now felt a double interest in it, and they waited almost impatiently for the day to come round. On Sunday morning, both girls went to an early Mass, and afterwards betook themselves to the graveyard. Let us enter with them. Here, indeed, is the City of the Dead! The Homes of the Departed are as thick as the dwelling-houses of a city. Each grave is a " tenement"-house: it contains many members of a family. See, there are other places where the poor are buried. They are as thickly packed together as in life. These are the real "tenement"- houses of the Dead,-piled one upon another, just as they were in life,-crowded and crushed into a narrow sepulchre, with a light sprinkling of earth over them, but sufficient for the one great purpose, to preserve their decaying bodies from distempering the air. Ye poor! ye were a nuisance in life, ye are the same in death. Why were ye poor? Speak out from your graves and   tell us, Why were ye poor? Close beside ye are hand- some marble monuments, carved and fretted in the high- est art of the sculptor; tablets, with letters of gold, de- tail the virtues of those who repose beneath. How many instances may be found wherein such tableted vir- tues are the only acknowledgment of dead men's good- ness. How often are such tributes to their memories sculptured lies. Alas, how often! Virtue and goodness lie huddled together, while in many instances, vice and villany occupy the reserved "lots " as they did in life. True, many of these tombstones, with their beauti- fully carved crosses and marble angels, cover the mortal remains of the sainted and good, but, as a rule, the mar- ble is as great a liar in life as in death. O, how sweet to reflect that, as we wander among the homes of those who have gone before us, that there is indeed a heaven I! how consoling the thought that there is a Judge who sums up the evidence of the heart,-who knows the feelings of those who would bear false testi- mony,-who sees, with His omniscient and inscrutable eye, the motive of every act, and who will render justice to all alike, irrespective of their poverty or wealth. That is the true consoler, that robs death of its bitterest pang, and gives to the troubled soul the sweet solace of an unmixed joy. Mary and Ailey walked arm-in-arm among the graves. They admired the stately erections placed by loving hands over deceased parents, and felt a sort of spiritual joy at the many manifestations of that ever living faith that delights the hearts of the virtuous and true, and which meet the eye at every turn in a place of sepulture, such as that visited by Ailey and Mary. As the two girls approached the spot sacred to the memory of "OUR LITTLE BRIDGET," they observed a lady and gentleman reverently engaged in decking the grave with fresh flowers. They immediately made a sudden Of        .   turn, not wishing to intrude, and guessing rightly that those engaged in that offce of love were theparents of the deceased child. Scarcely had Mary retraced her steps but a few yards when her eye restedon amarble Cross,thesight of which almost deprived her of the power of motion. She was leaning on her cousin's arm, and Ailey felt a convulsive movement that thrilled through every nerve of her body. She looked in Mary's face, which was pale as death, and in a voice fluttering with excitement, asked her what was the matter ? But Mary couldn't speak. Ailey got alarmed and turned to call for help. The lady and gentleman were about to leave, and, observing the distracted look of Ailey, approached the girls. Mary gasped, and pointed to the Cross while Ailey, with a bound, sprang forward to the object, and there, reverently suspended from  one of the arms, was Mary's LONG LOST Rosary! When Mary regained her treasure, she clasped it to her heart, then kissed it again and again.  Thegentle- man and lady'now became interested spectators,and, approaching nearer to the two  girls, inquired kindly if there was anything wrong with them? "Nothin , sir!" "Nothing, sir," replied Ailey. "We were just a little startled at finding a Rosary--a present of my cousin's.', "I'm very glad  you found it," said the gentleman. " Only a few minutes ago,"' he continued, "I was pass- ing, and saw the Rosary lying on the grave. I suspected that'some one had been kneeling there and had forgot- ten it, and I hung it on the arm of the Cross, in order to attract the eye of the owner." "O, how kind of you, sir; but for that my cousin would not likely have ever seen it." "But would  you not have known the     grave again where you dropped it ?" he inquired, somewhat puzled  162      The Lost Rosary. at the affectionate manner in which Mary had received what appeared to him as a thing of little value. Explain to the lady and gentleman, Aley," said Ma- ry, in a voice exceedingly tremulous. Ailey did so in as brief a manner as possible. The lady felt greatly interested both in the appearance of the girls, and in what she had heard. So did the gentleman, who felt highly gratified that he had the good fortune to not pass unheeded the little article of devotion which he had observed lying among he grass on the grave. Then you had no other business here, but to visit the grave of ' our little Bridget?' " said the lady, inquir- ingly. "None, ma'am' replied Ailey. "Your friend appears verymuch agitated,' said the gentleman, in a very friendly tone of voice. "Only a little, sir," answered Mary, with an effort that ill bespoke the thorough truthfulness of her reply. Both the lady and gentleman expressed their desire that Mary and Alley should pay them a visit whenever they had leisure, and for that purpose gave them their address. The girls promised to do as requested, and the lady and genleman kindly took their leave. Mary and Ailey remained, and when alone, both, with one impulse, knelt down just at the spot where the LOST RoseY was recovered, and silently engaged in prayer. The Cross on which the gentleman had so carefully and thoughtfully placed the fond remembrancer of B1ar- ney Mcauley, was somewhat singular and attractive. It was of plain dove marble, with a -sculptured wreath in the middle of the upright shaft, and the word "Mother," in bass relief, insidethewreath or oronal. The whole structure was simple, but was inexpressibly beautiful on that very account. "Who would have thought itl" said Ailey, quite   The Lost Rosary.        163 cheerfully. "Here we came out for a quiet stroll among the graves, and, just as sure as we live to-day, there's lots of good luck before us." "Yes; it is exceedingly strange," said Mary. "Com- ing out here to have another peep at the little grave; meeting the father and mother of the poor little Bridget; for I am sure," she continued, "they are none other; finding poor Barney's long lost present just hanging be- side the word 'Mother;' oh, it is very strange l" and Mary clasped the Rosary in both her hands, and kissed it again and again, with a fervor that meant something more than the recovery of a lost present of so little in- trinsic value, but invaluable to her for all the associa- tions connected with it,-and especially for that sweet and admirable devotion of which it is the emblem. "I think we will return now," said Aliley. "Won't you promise now, dear cousin, not to separate from me to look for work?" asked Mary, unconscious of Ailey's hint to return. "We611, Mary, you are a wonderful girl. ' Do you really think that I wish to separate or part from you?" said Ailey. "But you'll see what good will come out of this," add- ed Mary. "I know it, I feel it," she cried out most rap- turously.. "Well shouldn't we retrace our steps now," hinted Ailey, once more; for Mary really seemed rooted to the spot. "I was just thinking," said the latter, " that perhaps the person who dropped or left the Rosary here might return to search for it, and by that means I could learn all about it." Ailey consented to this arrangement, adding, "There can be no person but the girl you saw in the hospital concerned in it." "Even so," replied Mary. "The greatest part of my   164       The Lost Rosary. grief at that very time was to learn how she came by it." Both remained, and not finding any person as expect. ed, they strolled through the burying-ground for half an hour afterward, but failed to discover any one visiting the grave where the Rosary had been found. When Moll Hanley and Mrs. McGlone had learned the good fortune that attended the visit to the burying- ground, they shared in the general happiness of Mary and Ailey. "Och, but God's ways is like nobody else's ways;" cried MolL. "Jist to think of it now! Sure, an' if I hadn't tould yees that story about the misfortunate Alice McGrain, ten chances to one yees would never have thought of going to see the little grave. And, my good- ness, you might have been just an hour earlier or later, as not one of yees would ever have seen it. Well, to be sure, what strange things do happen at times!" and Moll seemed lost in meditation.!"It's no use," she cried out, "trying to unravel what's unravelable-there 's a high- er power nor us to do these things-but that's one o' the strangest occurrences I've met with this many a day. Next morning, Mary proceeded to her daily toil with a much lighter heart than she had experienced for a long time. Her troubles had been great, and were nobly borne. She had formed some notion in her mind, that if Ailey left her to find a place, that all she had gone through would rush back upon her heart, and be ever present before her mind. That morning, Mrs. McGlone had been and procured some needle work, at which Ailey was an adept, and poor -Mary had the gratification of beholding Ailey busy at her sewing before she left. Inwardly throughout that day she kept her heart raised to God, and in humble heartfelt thankfulness directed her thoughts to Her who had proved herself a Protect- ress and a Refuge in the dark hours of trouble and heavy trials. She felt she was no longer unprotected, and somehow her thoughts did wander to Barney McAuley,   The Lost Rosary.       165 and for flte first time since her arrival in America, felt some sort of assurance that she would yet see him. Would he be changed? Would Tim still be his com- panion? Did Ailey think more about Tim than she thought of Barney? These, and a hundred other such like thoughts kept coursing through Mary's mind all that day, and when she returned in the evening, Ailey was very glad to see what a delightful change for the better had taken place in the appearance of cousin Mary. Ailey, too, was changed, and lMary was not slow to per- ceive it; but Ailey attributed all her- happiness to the renovated looks of her cousin.   166       The Lost Rosary. CHAPTER xxi V. MARY AND AITT cY WI'rT 'rlal. ISiW FRlqJuS-- A SUIR- PRISE. "O Life and Love! O happy throng Of thoughts, whose only speech is song I O heart of man! canst thou not be Blithe as the air is, and as free?" MR. and Mrs. O'Meara, the lady and gentleman who met Mary and Ailey in the burying-ground, occupied a house in a highly respectable locality in New York. Mr. O'Meara was a merchant who owed his position to his industry, perseverance, and integrity in business. Like many others, he arrived in New York a poor penniless boy; but he possessed the right qualities that command respect and ensure success. In his earlier days, he suf- fered a good deal of annoyance and petty persecution. On one occasion, he was treated very badly by an employ- er: he was accused of appropriating a small sum of mon- ey, and was told to leave his place instantly. As he was leaving, he heard the remark--"What, could you expect of an Irish brat of a Papist, who hadn't a soul to recom- mend him?" Young O'Meara turned sharply round, and, with his face beaming with honest indignation, said:-"I am Irish, and a Papist, too, and that is just the reason that I wouldn't condescend to the commission of the crime you lay to my charge." "What's that you say!" roared out his master, a man   The Lost Rosary.        167 who was acting more on the information of others than on his own judgment. O'Meara repeated his words. "Come here, sir!" shouted the employer. O'Meara obeyed. "Do you mean to say that you didn't take that quar- ter?" "Certainly, sir, I mean to deny it," was the quick re- sponse, while the blood mantled the face of the speaker. A sharp blow on the cheek was the result of such plain speech,. and O'Meara departed. "Irish or Papist, Papist or Irish, that young fellow is as innocent as I am," said a gentleman who witnessed the whole proceeding. "Boss " was annoyed. He sent after the young man, but he couldn't be found. "Darn the young cuss; p'raps he is innocent, after all," he said. Six months afterwards, " that quarter " was found where it had no right to be, and "Boss " declared he felt both glad and sorry. "If I could only find O'Meara," he exclaimed, "I would make it all square with the poor fellow; " but he didn't then find him. Shortly afterwards a gentleman called upon this em- ployer, telling him that a young man paid him a visit that day, seeking after a place. When asked for a refer- ence, he said he had none to give except that of his first employer, and there was no use applying to him, as he had dismissed him for the alleged appropriation of a quarter-dollar. This seemed very strange to the gentle- man. It was like a self-accusation against the young man himself, and, feeling an interest in the poor boy, he determined to learn the truth of the whole affair. -"What he says is true," replied O'Meara's old employ- er. "He was accused, sir, but wrongly accused; and if I   168      The Lost Rosary. can find him out, either in your employment, or in the employment of any other person, I'll have him, sir-I'll -have him at any cost." "I am very glad I called upon you," said the stranger, "aas my visit may benefit the young man. I will send him to you, sir, straight away." Shortly afterward, O'Meara appeared before his first and only employer in New York. "Glad to see you," said "Boss," extending his hand to his former employee. "Thank you, sir," the young fellow replied. "See now," continued the master, "I did you an inju- ry, young man; nothing like acknowledging a fault of that sort, because there is no other proper way of repair- ing a thing of that kind. See now, go you into that store, raise yourself to a position in it, and when you want a friend, or a big thing done, just you tell me first, d'ye hear?" "Yes, sir," replied O'Meara; and the young fellow re- turned his thanks, telling at the same time that he had applied in a dozen places for employment, but was refus- ed in consequence of his story. When questioned, he adhered to the truth, and would not vary one jot, even to get a place. He was unskilled in the tricks of others, and for some time could not comprehend the cause of his being repeatedly refused. He imagined that the heinousness of the charge laid against him should have, at least, procured him commiseration; but those who required his services only laughed at him, and, of course, did not believe one word he said. He contrived to live by engaging at some menial employment, but his spirit yearned for decent work,-hence the attempt that at last found favor in the eyes of the gentleman who called up- on his former employer. Sink or swim, this young fel- low determined on following the maxim, "Honesty is the best policy;" and a lie he would not tell, even to gain himself the means of a comfortable living.   The Lost Rosary.        169 Things righted themselves in his regard, after all, as they invariably do, if attended to in a like manner. He had not now to win the confidence of the man in whose employment he was engaged; that was already won; but he had to prove his worth in a thousand dif- ferent ways, and he did prove it. For nearly fourteen years, he remained in the one em- ployment. At the end of that time he, by advice, start- ed business on his own account, and was very successful. His business was of that nature that his personal super- intendence was requisite almost hourly. After the un- timely death of his child, Mr. O'Neara suffered more in mind and body than his wife or nearest friend were aware of, and the consequence was a considerable falling off in the business of his place. As he recovered from the shock, his trade also revived, and at the time we are first introduced to this gentleman and his good lady, both were trying to forget the heavy affliction that had befallen them in the cruel death of "Our Little Bridget." Sunday came round, and Mary and Ailey wended their way to Mr. O'Meara's. They were very kindly received by Mrs. O'Meara, who, since the accidental meeting in the Cemetery, had conceived a strong liking for the two strange girls. "Mr. O'Meara is not home from vespers," said the lady; "-but he will be in soon, as he expects to see you both." "He is very kind," said Mary, who felt a little ill at ease in consequence of the grandeur of the apartment into which she had been introduced. "We are quite satisfied at seeing yourself, Madam, and hope you are quite well," said Alley. "Yes, indeed, thank you; I am- vastly improved these few weeks," replied Mrs. O'Meara, highly pleased with the modesty of the girls, and the kind inquiry of Aliley. Mary O'Meara, the only child of the lady and gentle-   170       The Lost Rosary. man whom Mary and Alley were visiting, was a sweet lit- tle cherub, with beautiful yellow hair and large blue eyes. Tnmrnediately on seeing Mary and Ailey, she kept close to them, and nestled in beside Ailey, as if she had known her long before. Ailey was delighted and amused with her. The bell rang, and little Mary ran to the parlor door, shouting out, "Pa, Papa a-comin'." It was just as the child surmised, Mr. O'Meara entered, and was well pleas- ed at seeing his two new-made friends. He saw at once that his wife was well pleased with her visitors, and he declared he had not seen little Mary so blithe and merry for a long time before. Mary and Ailey, it must be told, had not a superabund- ance of dress, and especially of that class of dress which; might have been expected by outsiders, as most suitable for persons visiting the O'Meara's. Their dress was ex- ceedingly plain and unpretentious. There was a ribbon or two visible, but that was all in the shape of shining colors. The girls' dresses, however, were exceedingly neat, and in excellent taste, and this was the secret that made them please both Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara so- wells Tea was ordered, and a right pleasant hour was Bspent. The only servant in the house was a general maid-ser- vant; the cook had her "Sunday out; " and no nursery, maid had been there since Alice McGrain. The maid- servant was a fine, sturdy young Irishwoman, with a face as rosy, and as pleasant to look upon, as the dawn of a fine summer morning in June. Servant Kitty was introduced to Mary and Ailey, and the two latter did feel a slight blush rise to their cheeks, as Kitty curtseyed, and hoped the "young ladies were quite well." Kitty joined the party at tea, and a right pleasant eve-\ lng was spent by one and all. Little Mary O'Meara was half wild with joy. She ran about in such a manner as %             \  .   '   The Lost IRosary.       171i she had not done for a long time before; and the merri- ment that shone in her eyes was like balm to the heart of both parents. She sat on Ailey's knee, then on Mary's, as if undecided which to like best, . It is somewhat strange that children are seldom if ever wrong in the instinct of their likes and dislikes towards strangers; and I have often heard it remarked by those who closely watch such things, that suchx a person can- not be good, as a child could not be coaxed into their graces, no matter what bribe was held forth. If this thing hold good, and I see no valid reason to oppose to it, Mary and Ailey must have occupied a very high place in the esteem of Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara; and they did, too, much higher than any of those concerned were aware. The conversation got to be quite general in its charac- ter, and both of the cousins shared an amount of intelli- gence and culture that rather astonished their new friends. It was evident to the lady and gentleman that with all their open-mindedness, there was something of a delicate nature specially reserved by Mary and Ailey in speak- ing of their home and their vicissitudes since landing in America. "As thrue as the divil goes about roarin! an seekin' who he'll ate, there's them pack o' ranters from New Jersey, be- ginnin'," said Kitty, as the sound of voices was heard join- ing in something like a funereal dirge. Ailey and Mary were not so very polite, although in a strange place, as not I to laugh outright at the remark of servant Kitty. It was not, however, the words she used, so much as the energy with which she used them, and the appearance of her face, which was quite flushed. "But Kitty,", observed Mrs. O'Meara, " we must not think too hard of these people. Perhaps they are sin- cere in what they do, and we must give therm credit at least for that."   172       Tlhe Lost Rosary. "It's well you saved youself, Ma'am, with all your 'perhaps,' for how could people like them be sincere, least of all that woman," replied Kitty. Just then, the door-bell was rung, and when Kitty an- swered the call, a voice was heard maling the inquiry: "Plaze, Ma'am, is it here the Rev. Naiser Nookes lives?" "Troth an it's not, Ma'am, God be thanked," was the instant reply. 3iary and Ailey looked at each other in. astonish- ment, and both Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara exchanged glances which plainly meant, "Are we deceived in those girls?" "An', maybe', my good, young woman, you could tell me where he lives?" "Troth an' I can; but it's sing'lar to hear the loiks o' you askin' for sich a man." "Och, an' it's God knows, I know little about the man; but it's a woman as lives with him, that has a daughter ailin', that I wants to see." "It is her, Aliley dear," said Mary. "It is Moll Han- ley." "Do you know the person speaking to Kitty?" inquired Mrs. O'Meara. "Oh, yes, Madam, dear," said Ailey; "a good, good woman." "Kitty," shouted Mr. O'Meara. "Yes, sir," was the reply. "Ask the woman to come this way, if she pleases." "Will you please step in, Master wants you," said Kitty to the person at the door, quite politely; and the person stepped in.   The Lost Rosary.        173 CHAPTER XXV. "The dawn is not distant, Nor is the night starless; Love is eternal, God is still God, and His faith shall not fail us; Christ is eternal." DEAT:H OF ,JN E1 CLARKSON. "GOD save you all kindly," was Moll Hanley's salute, as she entered the parlor, for it was she indeed, as large as life, and before she had time to collect her scattered thoughts, Ailey and Mary both sprang forward to meet her. "Musha, then God bless us all, but it's here I find you both," said Moll, accepting the seat handed to her by Mr. O'Meara. Moll Hanley speedily explained her business. Jenny Clarkson had taken suddenly ill, and wished to see her mother and sister. Her mother lived as housekeeper with Naiser Nookes.       l "The Rev. Ebenezer Sookes," interposed Mrs. O'Meara. "The same, Ma'am, an' sure it's the quare names some people have." A few minutes sufficed to explain matters fully, and nothing could detain Moll Hanley on her mission, when- ever she learned that she was near the house she was in search of. Rising and thanking the good lady and gentleman for   174-      The Lost Rosary. their kindness in affording her the information she re- quired, she took her leave, giving such a look of entreaty at Mary and Ailey, not to divulge anything concerning Alice McGrain, that meant all she wished to convey. "Poor Jenny!" said Mary, when Moll had retired.- t"Her's is a sad enough case." Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara ex- pressed their anxiety to know more about the girl, and Mary related her story. As she did so, Mr. O'Meara paid the most marked attention to every word. "And that is the woman you are living with?" said Mr. O'Meara. "Yes, sir," replied Mary. "We had the misfortune to be decoyed into a house when we landed," continued Mary, " which-which had some bad character, I under- stand, and we then went to live with Moll Hanley and a Mrs. McGlone." "Did you remain long in your first boarding-house?" inquired Mrs. O'Meara. "Just till we found another," replied Ailey; A" and we were not long about that-only about an hour, I think." Mary related, with considerable feeling, her own and Ailey's first experiences in America. During her recital the tears often sprang to her eyes, while Ailey held her head bowed down as she listened to Mary's pathetic re- cital. - Mr. and. Mrs. O'Meara were evidently much affected, not only with all they heard, but with the simple man- ner in which the trials of these friendless girls was told, from the moment they entered Paddy Farren's house up till the finding of the LosT ROSARY. "I still feel unsatisfied," said the lady, " about the his- tory of that Rosary. I understood you to say that a dear friend gave it you," she added, addressing Mary. "Quite so," replied Ailey. "And I have a strong suspicion," said Mr. O'Meara. "that there is a nice little secret connected with that same Rosary, and in order to give Mary, an opportunity   The Lost Rosary.        175- of making it known to you, if she feels disposed, I shall retire. You know," he continued, addressing his wife, "I have to call over at the new office to leave instruc- tions for the men to-morrow morning; " saying which, he kindly bade Mary and Alley good evening, and hoped to see them often again. "So often," said Mrs. O'Meara, " that if Alley is out of a place, and wishes to accept an engagement from me, I am ready and willing to have her from this forward." "I shall be most happy if you prevail upon her," said Mr. O'Meara, as he withdrew. "Iss, Iss," said little Mary, who comprehended more by- the appearance of matters, and the tone of the speak- ers, than by understanding. "Ailey comes home," and the dear creature looked up so lovingly in Ailey's face, that she could not resist the impulse of lifting the child and imprinting a sweet kiss on its ruby lips. A short time sufficed to arrange that Ailey should oc- cupy the post of nursery maid and companion to Mrsg. O'Meara. Mary was consulted in the arrangements, and expressed her perfect willingness, especially as she had found such warm-hearted friends in the person of Mr.- and Mrs. O'Meara; and that a promise had been exacted from her to come and see Ailey as often as possible, but, especially, never to allow a Sunday evening to pass by without a visit. "We sometimes see friends and ac- quaintances," said Mrs. O'Meara; " but, as a rule, our Sun- day evenings are lively enough with servant Kitty, and little Mary and papa, and sometimes one or two of the store men, of whom papa is very fond, especially the head man in his employment." Mary entered into a history of the Rosary; and not only that, but into a history of the greater part of her life, which she candidly related to her newly-found friend, omitting nothing, not even the position in which she stood towards Barney McAuley.   176       The Lost Rosary. "And you never heard of him since your arrival here?" inquired Mrs. O'Meara, with particular interest in all she had heard. "' Never heard a word about him," answered Mary. "Well, it does seem strange to me," said the lady; " but I feel, somehow, that I must have heard that name, Bar- ney McAuley, before now, but under what circumstan- ces, or where, I'm sure I can't tell." Poor Mary's heart beat almost audibly as she listened to every word that fell from the lips of the lady who ad- dressed her. Ailey, too, had listened with rapt attention to all that had been said. When leaving, Alley promised to commence her duties early in the week. She had some little preparations to make, and would require a few days for that purpose. Servant Kitty was very proud when she heard that Alley was coming to live with her. "O, good an' a gracious, but it's the fine mistress an' master you're comin' to sarve." "There now, Kitty, that's enough," broke in Mrs. O'Meara, who had oftentimes before experienced such grateful expressions from Kitty. The poor girl had been mercifully relieved from a most painful position by her mistress, and she had never forgotten the kindness. There are few in this world whose hearts are filled with a purer gratitude to those who do them an act of kindness at any time, but especially in the hour of need, than the friendless girls of Ireland. A life's devotion is not considered by them too much to repay such kind- ness as Kitty had experienced from her gentle and kind- hearted mistress. When Mary and Ailey returned home, they found that it was not without cause that Moll Hanley had endeav- ored to bring the mother and sister of Jenny Clarkson to see her. For some days previously the poor girl had   Thie Lost Rosary.       1" been suffering, but had managed to appear not so ill as she really was. Moll's experience, however, soon detect- ed the girl's well-intentioned efforts, and speedily pro- cured the services of a doctor to attend her. When she learned that Moll had not succeeded in finding her friends, Jenny felt much worse. Moll Hanley was correct as " to the letter of the law," in telling the poor girl that she had not succeeded in finding them; but she had found out enough to satisfy her that if anything serious or fatal happened to the girl,  the visit of either mother or sister or both would do her little good. "It was Naiser Nookes, himself, I saw," said Moll to Mrs. McGlone; ' an' when I delivered my message, he went back to some singin'-school, and shortly returned with the word that Mrs. and Miss Clarkson were just then engaged at evening devotions, an' couldn't attend 'to any message." "What a hard pack they must be," said Mrs. McGlone. "Did they not promise to call an' see the poor thing?" "Troth, I think Naiser is the best o' the lot o' them,', said Moll. "He asked the number o' the door an' the street, an' I suppose he will call." Mary and Ailey sat by the bedside of the sick girl dur- ing the entire night. They proved themselves sisters to the lone girl, for they had learned from Moll the ill-suc- cess of her mission. Their own kind hearts, however, would have shown them their duty in that regard, irre- spective of Moll Hanley's information. It was a weary night, and Jenny Clarkson moaned a great deal. Towards morning she felt something easier, and was astonished to find both Mary and Ailey beside her. She thought she had been alone. Mary spoke in a low tone to her, telling her not to dis- turb herself by speaking, unless she had something par- ticular to say. 12   178       The Lost Rosary. "Nothing," said Jenny; " but if it were breakfast time, I would like to see a priest." "Certainly, dear girl," replied Mary; and a messenger was quickly despatched for that purpose. Meantime, Mary and Ailey maintained their position -towards the sick girl. In a short time the clergyman ar- rived, and spent half an hour in the sick room. Jenny appeared much easier, both in mind and body. She con- tinued much in the same way for the remainder of the day, but as night advanced she became worse. Moll Htanley announced her willingness to make an- other trial to bring the mother and sister to see her; but Jenny did not wish to give them any trouble on her ac- count; in fact, she preferred not to hear them spoken of, but wished to remain " contented just as she was." "What's your opinion o' the poor thing, doctor dear?" inquired Moll, when that gentleman was taking his leave after a visit. "Well, if she continues as she is till morning," said the doctor, " she will last through to-morrow; but, if there be any change before then, I'm somewhat doubtful of the result. She is very weak at present, and won't hold out long, I'm afraid." "God help her, poor lonely thing," said the kind- hearted Moll, as she prepared to pay the doctor his fee. That gentleman, however, suspected that the person who addressed him was paying the money herself, and feel- ingly told Moll that he was entitled to do something in such a case, when others were doing so much for the poor girl. "In that case," said Moll, "I won't refuse your kind- ness;" and the doctor took his leave, after prescribing some unimportant things for his patient, and rather proud of himself for having detected the woman's self- sacrificing spirit, and not adding to her burdens. The morming came with its bright golden smiles, shed-   The Lost Rosary.       179 ding a rich yellow light on Jenny Clarkson's bed. The clean, white counterpane that covered the spot on which she lay, was not whiter than the fair face of the occu- pant. Jenny Clarkson was dead! A sweet smile seemed playing over her features. There was a softness about the youthful mouth, and the lips, even in death, retained a tinge of red that relieved the marble whiteness of the face. Out in the city, crowds are hurrying here and there- some with light hearts, and gay, laughing faces; there are poor, honest girls hurrying past to avoid notice; there are others with fevered brow and heavy hearts, who lived like demons through the night, their lips foul with blasphemy, and encrusted with their poisonous breath. The dress of the latter was gay and fashiona- ble twelve hours ago; now it is broken, torn and fad- ed. Death within the dwelling of Moll Hanley and Mrs. McGlone, and living death outside! Which was preferable: that dead innocent girl, with the loving smile upon her face, or those of her age with- ered with drink and dissipation, young in years, aged in crime; lost forever to virtue? Death for the young has no attractions, at least,'for the majority of youth; yet they should be taught to know its holiness, and to welcome it, rather than fall from the high estate of purity. Death is not always an evil, even to those who survive. The grave is as natural as the cradle. To those without Faith, the dissolution of the body and soul must always have its terrors. But to those fortified with the Sacra- ments of the Church, it is altogether different. The pure-minded Christian will often desire a continuance of pain and suffering, in order to purify the soul for the change it is about to undergo. Some such thoughts as these coursed through the   180       The Lost Rosary. minds of those who sat in the little bed-chamber after its-late tenant had been laid in the grave, not far from the spot adorned with the little hieadstone, inscribed, ' OUR LITTLE BRIDGET." Neither mother nor sister had attended the funeral of Jenny Clarkson. They did not even know of her death; and Moll Hanley maintained it did not matter much. "Don't you remember," she said, addressing Mrs. Mc- Glone, " how her poor father was left to the care of the two strange young men, on board the ship? Aye, in- deed, God help us," she continued, addressing Mary and Ailey, " them two young men, Barney McAuley and Tim Heggarty, God bless them both, attended that poor girl's father.9" - "Moll Hanley 1" called out Mrs. McGlone. "See I see! Mary's quite ill." "' Heaven bless you, my child!" cried Moll, springing over to where Mary sat.           M? "She has fainted!" cried Ailey, who also was as pale as death. "What is the matter?" said Mrs. McGlone, much frightened. "Mary and Barney McAuley are friends," said Aley, with very considerable effort.  , '   The Lost Rosary.       181 CHAPTER XXV1. SINGULARITY OF DREAMS-A LOST LOVER FOUND. "Two dreams alike in every way, To be revealed ere break of day; If not, they were'but misty air, Faithless to both our girls so fair.", AILEY had been nearly five months in Mr. O'Meara's house, as nurse and companion to the good lady of that happy dwelling, when one evening Mary, according to her custom, paid Ailey a visit. She was not long arrived when she had an opportunity of speaking with her cousin in private. s' I must leave that place, Ailey," said Mary. "I have borne with its private annoyances and insults as long as I am fit to bear them." "I was just expecting as much, from what you' told me last Sunday; and I approve, dear cousin, of your res- olution," replied Ailey. "From the moment that I obtained that small rise in my wages," Mary"continued, " the rude advances of that man, Miller, are positively disgusting. God knows how hard it is to put up with all this. None but a base na- ture could persecute me so, and I have no alternative but to leave. I would not have my ears assailed by the aspersions against my country and myself for all the place is worth." Mary O'Donnell had just cause of complaint, although there were, and are, too. many girls who would have on-   '182       The Lost Rosary. ly been too glad to have been in her place. A new over- seer had been admitted into the place where Mary was employed. He was a;Scotchman, who had been many years in America; and before he was three weeks in the place he had made himself obnoxious to Mary by his ill- timed attentions. He professed his love for her, and his desire to " stand by her." He got her salary raised a tri- fle, and thought he was entitled to act as he did towards the friendless girl. At first, Mary was obedient and care- ful not to give offence. She was not long allowed to re- main ignorant of his evil intentions. As soon as she discovered these, she very promptly compelled him to de- sist. He did so; but the peculiarity of his position en- abled him, without any risk to himself, to renew his im- portunities. This he continued to do, until, finally, Mary resolved to throw herself on the mercy of the world rather than put up with her persecutor. "We are a great deal better off now than formerly,"' said Ailey, quite cheerfully. "I have not, as you are aware, spent over five dollars of my wages. Mrs. O'- Meara is very kind to me, and I am right glad that you have resolved to leave that place for good and all." "As I was always in the habit of keeping Nelly Noonan beside me, when arranging the place after the girls left,.rm afraid he will be unmanly enough to take re- venge on the poor thing, and dismiss her," said Mary. "I shouldn't be at all astonished, for such men are capable of very mean acts," replied Ailey; "and you should bring her with you, Mary, for I'm fond of that poor, friendless little thing." "That's just what I had in contemplation," said her cousin. Well, that's settled now," cried Ailey; " you can fall to, and indulge yourself in making two or three dresses for both of us; Nelly can help you right well, and, as you won't require to be in a hurry to look out for another   The Lost Rosary.        183 situation for a while to come, your chances will be all the better; and now, dear coz, sit over there, near to the window, till I tell you a dream I had last night." "Wait a moment," said Mary; "that was part of my business with you this evening. Let me tell you mine first  " "Oh, now, is that fair?" asked Ailey. "Quite fair; for I have heard of persons dreaming at the same time and on the same thing, and I want to tell mine first," she added, " lest there should be any simi- larity between them, and then you might-- " "Oh, I know what you are going to say," put in Ailey, briskly; " well, let us hear; but, bear in mind, that dreams are worthless things, and, as these were Saturday even- ing dreams, they are of no use unless they come in true before midnight on Sunday." "On Sunday or Monday," continued Mary, " it is all one, for I don't believe in them, although I know that some things have happened in dreams that came true af- terwards." "Well, let us hear," said Alley. "I'm all impatience till I get telling you mine." "I was just gone asleep," commenced Mary, " for a few minutes -"- Here Aley burst out laughing. "That's just what I thought, too; but how can any one tell how long they were sleeping?" "I know well," replied Mary, " for I awoke soon after- wards, and found I had not been an hour gone to bed. But let me proceed. I thought I was walking down the old loaning which leads from the graveyard at home, when I met you and Tim coming along, walking about a yard apart. He looked downcast, and you were busy laughing. Now, thinks I to myself, Ailey is not acting fairly towards Tim; I can judge so much by his looks. Then he came. nearer to you, and you passed over to the   184       The Lost Rosary. opposite side. He stood awhile; then you went forward. He appeared irresolute still; I could see by him that he felt inclined to turn, and allow you to go on by your- self. Now, thinks I, if he comes this way I will hurry on and surprise him into a good temper. Then you stopped for an instant or two, and I also halted. A strange feeling came over me. I knew we had been in America, and somehow believed this was your first meet- ing, when suddenly there arose up a thin mist between you and Tim, and it grew thicker every moment, until I lost sight of you. As the mist increased, I could see that Tim wavered, and suddenly darted after you. In a moment he was lost to my view, and I called after him. I felt a choking sensation in my throat, and suddenly awoke, rubbing my eyes in the effort to look after both of you. There now, that was my dream; let me hear yours." Ailey's head was bent, and she seemed utterly lost in reflection.                      ^ "I am waiting to hear yours," added Mary, not half satisfied with the appearance of her cousin. Ailey rallied herself a good deal, but there was a pale- ness remained in her face that pained Mary to look at. "Well, as you said, Ailey, I'm all impatience to hear your dream." Aliley still kept silent. "O, very well, cousin," continued Mary, " if you think that's fair, I'm sure I need not trouble myself about your bit of a dream. What are they after all but a bubble in the air, or something of that sort." Ailey raised her eyes to those of her cousin, and as she did so, Mary saw  that they were suffused with tears. 4 She felt grieved, as she knew there must have been something in her dream that annoyed Ailey; or, that her rehearsal of it had awakened thoughts perhaps of too tender a nature in the girl's mind. In fact, she did   The Lost Rosary.       185 not exactly know what to think, and so felt worried, and displayed a little temper for a few minutes, either acted at the moment in order to arouse Ailey, or natural it may have been. It would be a blessed world if no greater evil ever happened than the betrayal of that bit of tem- per'on the part of Mary O'Donnell. It was like a rose tree shaking its flowers in obedience to a contrary breeze and shedding the full treasure of its odors on the fra- grant air. Mary arose from her seat and was about to leave, when Ailey asked her to remain for a little. The tremulous tone of her cousin's voice made Mary half angry and half ashamed at herself. "I know you are anxious to hear my dream, as I have heard yours," began Ailey in a slow voice. "Of course I was anxious to hear it," replied Mary; "but if it occasions you any pain, I would rather you deferred telling me till some other time." "No pain in the least," answered Ailey; "but I just thought that I saw a strange resemblance between your dream and my own." "What if you did?" added Mary, whose voice also be- trayed a little tremulousness, for she did not like that the two dreams should resemble each other. She- could give no reason for her feelings, nor did she care to ex- amine the question to find why she disliked the fact of their resemblance, but she knew she would have felt bet- ter pleased if it had not been so. "I thought," commenced Ailey, "that I was alone, and walking in the same loaning that leads from the grave- yard, when suddenly I saw Tim coming towards me. I did not just care to meet him face to face, least he might have supposed that somehow I knew of his presence there, and wished to put myself in his way, so I turned suddenly around with my back towards him. I could hear his feet as he made to overtake me. Then his ap.   186      T/he Lost Rosary. proach seemed to slacken, and I walked along very slow- ly, when the sound of his-footsteps died away altogether. I turned, and saw him with his hands stretch ed out toward me. I wondered what it could mean, and began to move toward where he stood. As I did so, a mist sprang up between us, and got thicker and thicker every moment. I did not look upon this as very unusual, but kept walk- ing on to where I believed he was still standing. Then I began to grope and search about, and finally called out his name. There was no answer, and I called again much louder. Faintly the sound of a voice was borne to my ears, and my name was pronounced as if with a dying gasp. I became quite faint, and swooned away. I lay in that state for some time, quite unconscious, and when I opened my eyes I was lying across my mother's grave. The mist had cleared away; the birds were singing in their clearest melody, butt here was not a hu- man being within sight of me. I felt that, my body gave a shiver as I arose, and in my efforts to get upon my feet I awoke, while a cold, clammy sweat overspread my face." "Well, yes, I acknowledge there is some resemblance," said Mary; "but, as you yourself said, Saturday night. dreams are of no consequence, nor Sunday's, for all that, I'll be bound." "Perhaps you're right," chimed in Alley; " we will slip into the parlor; I know Mrs. O'Meara would like to talk to you a little. She was dull to-day, and inquired about you, and what time you would likely be over.", In passing across the hall, Mary observed Mr. O'Meara engaged in speaking with a man at the hall door, appar- ently giving him instructions concerning, something of importance. The stranger kept looking at Maryland Aliley, as the former held her cousin by the arm, J'ust at the parlor door.   The Lost Rosary.       187: "Oh, only our nursery-maid and her friend," said Mr. O'Meara, who continued his conversation. When Mary and Ailey entered the parlor, little Mary O'Meara came out, and, running ulp beside her papa, caught the stranger by the hand. "-Oo just come in now, an' take tea," said the child, who was rewarded for her kind invitation, with a warm kiss. "  You may think it strange, sir," said the stranger-; "but may I inquire the names of those two young ladies?" "Well, upon my word, Tim, I did think you were pay- ing more attention to the young women than to my or- ders. Their names, I understand, are Ailey and Mary O'Donnell. One of them  lives here with me and Mrs.  " "Oh t did ever heaven see the likes o' this!" exclaimed Tim Heggarty, for sure enough, it was he indeed; one of the most faithful servants attached to Mr. O'Meara. '"The likes of what?" asked Mr. O'Meara; but Tim had dashed rather rudely into the parlor with little Mary in his arms. The mother sprang forward for her child, believing that something had happened to it, and observing a sort of wildness in Tim's eyes, eagerly inquired what was wrong? "Nothing specially wrong," said Mr. O'Meara, who had' followed Tim; " but so far as I can judge, there are some strange things happening about here these few weeks past, especially since Ailey came to live with us." Ailey O'Donnell looked up in her master's face, and Mary looked at Mrs. O'Meara. The latter did not com- prehend her husband; but she was quick enough to per- ceive by the twinkle of his kindly eye that nothing seri- ous had happened. Tim glided towards Ailey, but the girl's modesty for- bade her to look at a stranger, especially in presence of her'master and mistress.   188      The Lost Rosary. Mary looked around her, but failed to comprehend the position affairs were taking. "Ailey," said Mr. O'Meara, "I think I had better intro- duce you to Mr. Heggarty." "Dear Ailey!" cried Tim, as he lifted the beloved girl in his arms, and kissed her several times. Mary, as pale as death, had sprung to her feet, while the tears rushed to her eyes. "And, cousin Mary!" exclaimed Tim, half lifting Ailey across the floor. Impudently enough, Tim brought back the color to Mary's face, by subjecting .her to the same treatment that Ailey had undergone. "Oo won't get tea," roared out little Mary O'Meara, which caused a general roar of laughter. "How changed you are in your appearance, Tim," were the first words uttered by Ailey, whose heart flut- tered as she spoke, and gave a tremor to her voice. "In appearance only," said- Tim. "And now, when I have had time to draw my breath, how is your friend, Barney McAuley?" asked Ailey while Mary's eyes were rivetted on Tim. The' good fellow turned towards Mary, and offering his right hand to her, and the left to Ailey, which neces- sitated the crossing of his arms. "Barney McAuley," said Tim, "was at Church with me on last Sunday, having come into town the previous evening, an' in troth he's in as good health as the pair o' you could wish him. I can't say," added Tim, " that he's in the best o' spirits, for that would be a lie, Mistress O'Meara," he said, addressing that lady; 1" but if he only thought that Tim jgeggarty was in company this blessed evening with Mary and Ailey O'Donnell, troth it's on his head the poor fellow would dance a jig with joy." 1.   The Lost Rosary.        189 CHAPTER XXVII. A PLEASANT PARTY-TIM HEGGARTY MAKES FREEE--H MEETS OLD FRIENDS. "A drive in the cool fresh air, To drive away all care, When friends do meet, Each other to greet, There's nothing can compare." IT would be almost impossible to describe the unal- loyed happiness of the party at Mr. O'Meara's house on that Sunday evening. Mr. O'Meara suggested that Tim should get out the large carriage, and give the whole of them a good drive through the city. Little Mary would remain in charge of the servant, and Mrs. O'Meara would join them also. Mary O'Meara insisted on accompany- ing Ailey, and Tim obtained leave for her to come. "( The work's as good as done, sir," said Tim Heggarty, with a sort of laughing chuckle in his throat, and a bloom on his cheek as rich as the color of a rosy Irish apple.                i Mrs. O'Meara set about arranging her dress for the drive out, and was somewhat disappointed at the dilato- ' ry movements of Mary and Ailey. "You seem rather slow at your preparations, Ailey," said Mr. O'Meara; " and your cousin, too, does not seem to care much about our out-going," he added. "Pardon me, sir," said Mary, with her native modesty, "We are not used to carriage driving, and--" "Oh, I see," said Mrs. O'Meara, laughing right hearti-   190       The Lost Rosary. ly; "we are in America, Ailey, where mistress and ser- vant, especially a good servant like our Ailey, seldom make any particular distinction. You will offend Mr. O'Meara and myself, if you and Mary do not enjoy your- selves." Just then, Tim drove up to the door-the turn-out was gay and dashing-with a large family carriage, and a, pair of handsome chestnut horses in capital order for a spanking drive. The animals knew Tim's touch of the reins and the sound of his merry voice right well. A few minutes saw them all seated comfortably, and Tim seemed to have lost all idea of his former decorum. He turned around again and again to look at Ailey and Mary, and even had the hardihood to make some remarks to them about the night they pitched him into the bog- hole, and blind Darby roaring and laughing, as if he could witness the whole fun. To do Tim justice, he was guarded enough to indulge in these things only at certain places, where the quiet- ness of the place permitted himi to enjoy himself in his pardonable freedom. Mrs. O'Meara was happier than she had been formany a day. She could not resist a little banter at Ailey's ex-  pense. "He's a fine fellow, is Tim," said the lady. "I don't think that America has mended his manners, ma'am," replied Ailey. Tim's quick sense of hearing enabled him to catch the meaning of Ailey's remarks. "Faith, it's the improved boy I am," he shouted out; "but not half so fat as Barney McAuley." "That's intended for you, Mary, I presume," said Mr. O'Meara. "'Very likely, sir," answered the girl. "But he won't be as fat this day tWelvemonth, I'll go bail," laughed Tim, as he gave loose rein to the horses, and sped along in gay style.   The Lost Rosary.       191 Mary intended to keep her mind to herself respecting the whereabouts of Barney, until she would have a quiet opportunity of talking to Tim and Ailey; but she felt her heart getting lighter every moment. The drive through the cool, fresh air of the evening, the light mood and gay spirits of those around her, and, above all, the kind manner of Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara, enabled her to throw off some of h'r reserve, and without giving the matter further thought, she boldly inquired of Tim where Barney was located. Tim half turned his head to answer, and suddenly jerked it back again, but not till Ailey had caught one glance at the roguish expression of his eyes. Tim didn't answer. Mary blushed a perfect scarlet. "Miss O'Donnell is speaking to you," cried out Mrs. O'Meara. "And what is she saying, ma'am?" inquired Tim, with a tell-tale expression in his face, that plainly indicated that he did not require to ask that question. "Tell him, Mary," urged Ailey. Mary repeated her question, not in so loud a tone as at first, yet Tim heard every word she said. "Oh, an' indeed, but it's himself that's the thrivin' fel- low," said Tim, turning almost completely round in the driver's seat, so that he might have a fall view of the whole party; " an' never a bit of a rollin' stone is there about him, for he's in the one place since ever he came to this country, an' that's in a place called Port Jervis." Had Tim said Affghanistan it would have been all one to Mary. She was like all others newly landed in Amer- ica; and Tim, like many a would-be wiser man, thought that Mary should have known as much about the coun- try as he himself knew. Mary had lost her bashfulness for the evening, now that she had broken the ice by asking Tim a question,   192       The Lost Rosary. and finding that the gayety increased on all sides (chiefly in consequence of Tim's exuberance of spirits), she scru- pled not to speak in such a manner as betokened her particular liking for Barney McAuley. It is just possible that Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara may have observed an unaccountable silence on the part of Ailey, and so attempted to keep up the conversation. Ailey did not look half so well as when they had start- ed, and she had all the appearance of being just then en- gaged in thinking on some particular subject. Probably Tim was quick enough to observe this, as he pulled up under the shade of some fine trees, and asked Mr. O'Meara should he give the horses a rest. That gentleman nodded, and Tim immediately dis- mounted. Right under the driver's seat was a snug lit- tle recess for storing away odds and ends. Tim's leave to pull up meant something more than breathing time for the horses. With a knowing alacrity the good-heart- ed fellow drew forth a small carriage basket, but his carelessness in causing a jingling of glass brought a gen- tle reprimand from Mrs. O'Meara. "Faith, ma'am, it wasn't me that put that basket into its place," replied Tim, sharply, and with a good-natured nod at Mr. .O'eara. This was a home-blow to the lady herself, who hur- riedly had conveyed the little basket to the carriage at starting. Tim showed Mary and Ailey that he had improved in his manners since the night that poor Corny had paid him the compliment in the barn. With a particular gentility, that was well assumed for the occasion, he handed a glass of wine to Mrs. O'Meara, and then did the same to Mary and Ailey. "Will you, sir, take a glass of white wine?" asked Tim, addressing Mr. O'Meara. That gentleman assented, and told -Tim to take the same himself.   The Lost Rosary.       193 "All right, sir," replied Tim, whose grimace told plain- ly enough that the white wine bore a strong appearance to something very like Irish whiskey. Ailey regained her usual appearance. She had bat- tled bravely with whatever thoughts had tormented -her mind during the past hour, and had conquered them. Now she was as gay as the rest of the company, and the drive back was even pleasanter than in the earlier part of the evening. Little Mary O'Meara had fallen asleep on Ailey's knee, and that small circumstance gave a cue to Tim to keep up his pleasantry. He was very anxious to know if she would like to have a carriage of her own, and if she would take as much care of her own children as she was then taking of other people's? "Tim," cried out Mrs. O'Meara. "Yes, ma'am, I'm listening," was the answer. "Well, just you keep listening for awhile." And Tim did so. They were now re-entering the city, and Tim behaved, as he afterwards alleged, "like a gen- tleman." Arrived safely back, a pleasant hour was spent, and Ailey obtained leave to accompany Mary to Moll Han- ley's. "I suppose, Tim, you will be too busily engaged to- morrow to be in at work?" inquired Mr. O'Meara. "Well, sir," said Tim, " there are one or two things to be done in the morning; but afterwards, with your per- mission, I should like not only to-morrow to myself, but -the day following." "All right, Tim," replied his master; " your holidays  have been few heretofore. Make your own time, and I will be quite satisfied." Mrs. O'Meara shook hands very warmly with both Mary and Ailey. She did not attempt to conceal her joy at the unexpected meeting of the friends that even-. 13   194      The Lost Rosary. ing, and hoped that in future Tim would be more guard- ed in speaking of " other people's children." Tim prom- ised amendment, and he and Mary and Ailey took their departure. When they had gone, Mr. O'Meara said to his wife: "Well, that is about one of the strangest'meetings I ever beheld in all my life. Here is poor Ailey O'Donnell, so long in outhouse, and Tim all the time working away in the store as cheerful as possible, but still with the appearance of some little cankering care hanging over his mind. Isn't it strange?" "Very strange, indeed," replied Mrs. O'Meara. ".But to my mind, the strangest thing of all was the accidental meeting with Mary and Ailey that Sunday evening, at the grave of our little Bridget." "Yes, indeed," replied her husband. "I liked both girls from the first moment I saw them; and I took a sudden liking to Tim in the same manner, and have never had cause to regret either. Do you believe in first impressions?" "Well, not exactly," replied Mrs. O'Meara. "For in- stance, the first time I saw you, I thought you were about the--" But Mr. O'Meara had retired before the sentence was finished. He was speedily followed by Mrs. O'1leara, who no doubt insisted that, as she had been asked a fair question, that she was entitled to give a fair and unpre- judiced answer. When Tim landed in Moll Hanley's, with Mary! and Ailey, one on each arm, that good woman staredi with "both her eyes," and then rubbed her optics, to see if she still retained her sense of seeing. Tim endeavored to assume an- appearance of gravity, as he hoped by that means to impose on his quondam acquaintance. i Mary and Ailey both indulged themselves in peals of laughter, which so changed the usual appearance of their faces,   The Lost Rosary.       195 that Moll Hanley's doubts increased every moment, as to whether her eyes were not deceiving her. "A very good evening, ma'am," said Tim, advancing with his outstretched hand to Moll. "A very good evening indeed, sir, thanks be to God," was the reply. "Don't you know me, Moll Hanley?" was the next re- mark made by Tim. There was a steady look by Moll for a few moments. "Musha, praises be to Heaven, but it's yourself, Tim, dear 1 " and Moll held forth both her hands. Tim grasped them warmly, and in that instant the good fellow fully comprehended the kindness of Moll Hanley to the poor friendless girls. "I had a glass of white wine this evening," said Tim, "an' by the powers o' war, Moll Hanley, we'll have an- other.' Mary and Ailey discountenanced the proposal, but Tim told them to give themselves no trouble. Moll readily enough consented, if Tim would wait till Mrs. McGlone came in. Tim consented, and had not long to wait till he had the pleasure of beholding his old fellow-passenger. That was a happy meeting I Still Ailey felt ill at ease; something disturbed her. mind. At length she mustered courage to tell her dream, even in the presence of Tim himself. The tears streamed down Moll Hanley's cheeks with pure roguery and delight. "What a simpleton you are; Ailey, to be sure," said the kind-hearted Moll; " don't you see that it was bound to come true, as it did? What was the mist, but the thin 'petition' that divided you an' Tim since you went to Mr. O'Meara's to live. He was near you occasionally, and you were near him, and neither of you knew it." "But the graveyard?" suggested Mary.   196       The Lost Rosary. "Till death do us part i" replied Mrs. McGlone, seeing that lMoll was somewhat nonplussed at Mary's words. "O jabers I what I would give for a piper I " roared out Tim, as he heard the interpretation of the dream so sat- isfactorily given. Now it must be confessed that both Mary and Ailey felt annoyed at these dreams. When the nervous system has been severely tried it is always so; and who that has faithfully followed the fortunes of these girls will deny that they had been sorely tried,-that they had passed through a very trying ordeal, both Mary and Ailey. It is not to be wondered at, then, that tears of pure joy sprang into Ailey's eyes. As for Maiiy, she felt ashamed to say that she also had felt troubled in mind, not so much at the dream as at the similarity of hers with Ailey's. She refrained, however, from mentioning that cir- cumstance, and was glad that Ailey did the same, lest she should thereby lay herself open to some banter at the hands of Moll and Tim. Yes; it was a pleasant evening, indeed; and many were the stories told and the inquiries made. Tim listened with intense interest to the rehearsal of the death of Mary's father and mother. His heart was somewhat bowed as he learned the history of all that the girls had passed through, yet he maintained that he could see the hand of God visible in the whole thing. Nothing gave him so much pleasure as the relation of the incident by which Mary and Ailey had come under the care of Moll Uanley and Mrs. McGlone. To the astonishment of all, he related how Paddy Farrben had been sent to prison, only a few weeks ago, for an attempt to rob and other- wise injure a young woman and her little brother, who had been induced to take up their quarters in his place. At a late hour Tim took his departure, promising to return about noon next day. He kissed Ailey when leaving, much to the assumed annoyance of Moll Hanley, who bid him "C Get out or she would show him the door."   The Lost Rosary.       197 CHAPTER XVtIII. ME1ETING OF MARY A/D BARNEY-S    PLEASANT NIGHT OF IT. "But the night is fair, And everywhere  4 A warm, soft vapor fills the air, And distant sounds seem near." BEFORE noon next day, Tim, ip company with Ailey and Mary, were on their way bound for Port Jervis. This was the first opportunity that thei friends had of speak- ing, as it were, in private; and- yet they had little, if anything, to say that might not have been said in pub- lic; at least, before such friends as Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara, Moll Hanley and Mrs. McGlone. "And now that I have time to ast you, Tim Heggarty, how does it come that you dropped off corresponding with those you left behind?" inqui ed Ailey. Tim was certainly taken aback by the question. He was of opinion that he rand Barndy had just cause of complaint on that head, and that the fault lay with Mary and Ailey. "Well,' says Tim, " that's about the coolest question that I have heard proposed this many a day. It was just the very first thing I intended to talk about after the shock I received, when speaking to my boss, Mr. O'Meara. I just thought that in consequence of the troubles both o' you passed- through, that it might not be decent to introduce such a subject just then. But are you really serious?" asked Tim.   198       T/he Lost Rosary. "Are we serious, Tim? Is that what you ask?' said Mary. "Well, yes, God knows there is nothing to jest about in the like of that; at least, I think so." "It does seem rather strange to me," said Tim. "But finding that both of you are serious, we will defer any further talk upon the matter till we see Barney. In fact, neither of us have much explanation to offer. We both continued quite regular in our correspondence, till we got tired of waiting." "Precisely our own case," said Ailey. "But our pa- tience was more sorely tried than yours. Poor aunt Biddy used often to inquire, ' was there no word? ' Of course we did not attempt to deceive her, although we might have framed something like a letter from Ameri- ca." Tim was silent for a few minutes. "Well, well," he said, at length, " who knows, old girl," holding out his hand to Ailey, "we may all have happy and pleasant days hereafter; " then shaking lMary by the hand, " and as for Barney," he continued, " a truer fellow isn't on the continent of America. Many a dollar he has spent com- ing to see me, when he might just as well have remained at home, for all the comfort that I could give him. He still continued to believe that as I lived in New York, that maybe I might meet with some one landing here from Magheramore, or near the old place at home." The time sped on pleasantly enough until our joyful party reached Port Jervis. Tim knew the ground well, and so had no difficulty in finding out the place in which Barney McAuley resided. Barney was out just then, having gone to Middletown in the morning. "Boss " in- vited Tim and Mary and Ailey to take a walk over the farm, and that probably they would see Barney on his' home coming. Tim and the girls consented, and enjoyed their ramble to their hearts' content. M[ary and Ailey, for the :first   The Lost Rosary.        199 time since their arrival in America, saw the beauties of the. country. They were delighted as they wandered through the vineries, and their guide was exceedingly attentive to them. He pulled fruit of all kinds to treat them, and as he was very fond of Barney, did his best to show to Barney's friends how much he thought of him. Presently, a man was seen coming along the road, driv- ing a horse and wagon. "That's Barney, if I ain't mistaken," said the master. "You just stop here, and I'll send him straight along," saying which he went toward the house. At a turn in the road, the horse and wagon were con- cealed for a few minutes. "Now, I'll tell you what," said Tim, who felt as light- hearted as ever he did in all his life, "I'll stretch myself across towards the house, and let you two remain here just as you are. Barney knows Moll Hanley and Mrs. McGlone, and I'll just tell him that they came out here with some word from Ireland. Keep your ears open, an' when he comes in here, don't be in too big a hurry, you know, to lift up your heads," saying which, Tim depart- ed. Mary's head was, indeed, bent in thought. She was something paler from the moment Barney had appeared in view. She could not doubt, seeing how Tim had re- ceived them, but that Barney McAuley's heart was as true as ever. It must be acknowledged that Mary was glad, however, to have the - proof of Barney's steadfast- ness to his first love before she had the pleasure of see- ing him. Now that she had that proof in seeing Tim, and learning many things from him, she wished that it had, been Barney who came to see her, instead of Ailey and Mary O'Donnell coming to see Barney McAuley. This was a very small weakness on the part of Mary. It was just the least little tinge of pride, and--well, there's- no use moralizing on the private thoughts of   200       The Lost Rosary. Mary O'Donnell. There were many worse in the world, perhaps few better, but then Mary did not know as much. "There's Tim and Barney coming this way," said Ailley, who was peeping out among the branches, with an arch, sly look about her, nearly approaching to that of an eavesdropper. Tim was first to enter the vinery. He was evidently struggling hard to keep his features as rigid as possible, but it was a hard task, as was evident by his attempt to find something to laugh at, even the most trivial circumstance, such as tripping among some entangled leaves. Ailey had her face toward the en- trance, and was standing, while Mary sat with her back in the same direction; clear as a dew drop newly fallen on a rose leaf, a tear stood in Alary's eye, while a smile of ineffable happiness wreathed her handsome mouth. Her lips were gently apart, and her simple heart fluttered like a surprised bird. It was no wonder. In that in- stant or two, Mary O'Donnell's quick intellect had passed in review the whole scenes of suffering through which she and Ailey had passed; the sorrow and temptations both had endured since the happy time when last she looked on faithful Barney. "Two of our friends, all the way from-from-New York," said Tim, with a very fair attempt at acting. "A hundred thousand welcomes," said Barney, as he stretched forth his hand to Ailey. Ailey's hand was given with a languid carelessness that nonplussed Bar- ney. The place was shaded, and Barney peered into the face of Ailey, not doubting Tim's word as to the visitors who had honored him with a call. Barney looked at Tim, then again at Ailey. Tim's lips kept twitching at a strange rate. Ailey's head was still bowed. "Don't you know your old friend, Moll Hanley?" said Ailey.   The Lost Rosary.       201 At the sound of Ailey's voice, Mary turned her head and rose from her seat. Barney gave a glance from Ailey to Mary. He seemed dissatisfied, and looked again at Tim, but the latter was crunching some leaves in his mouth. At a bound, Barney sprang forward towards Mary, and grasping her somewhat roughly by the, arm, he turned her right round, and the smile that met his face revealed the whole plot. "Mary, Mary, is it possible, my long lost love!" cried the young man, and in a moment his strong arms encir- cled the waist of the half-fainting girl. At that moment Ailey was at his side, and the former languid hand now tightly grasped the hand of honest Barney McAuley. For a minute or two there was a dead silence at that meeting of friends. Tim laughed heartily, and for the time being, Barney had forgotten that his cousin tried to play him a trick. Mary complimented Barney on his fine appearance. Barney scarcely heeded her. He had a regular cate- chism of questions to ask her. Ailey perceived his anx- iety, and told him " all in good time." There were not many words spoken, but, on the whole, it was a, happy meeting,--so happy, that long-parted friends were satisfied to look upon each other, and think of the past. "O, thank Heaven for this happy meeting I " cried Bar- ney, from the fulness of his heart. "This morning, on going out on business for Boss, or Bosh, as I used to call him," he said, addressing Mary, "I felt so light-hearted that I couldn't account for it, no matter how I turned the matter over in my mind. At last, I cracked my whip, and said to myself, Tim Heggarty's a blackguard, if he hasn't got some news for both of us from home. Then I began to hum a snatch of an air to myself, an,' for a while, I kept wonderin' in my own mind, where the   202      The Lost Rosary. devil's this I heard that old tune, when, hurroo, I be- thought myself of the night when Blind Darby was seat- ed on his throne at the dance in your father's barn, Mary." "God rest him, an' the ould woman by his side," said Tim. "Faith an' there's some unlooked-for joy on the way before me, an' that, too, before Barney McAuley goes to bed this blessed night, I said to myself. But it's little I thought of seein' two o' the best girls in America, that's what it is; an' come now, Tim, 0uld times, boy, once more restored, let us get inside the house an' see if there's as much in this bit o' the New World as will make us happy for an hour or two." Our new-made party retired into the dwelling-house of Barney's master. Barney introduced his friends, at least the female portion of them, and "Boss" was quick enough to perceive how matters stood. If he did not at once understand them all, both Tim and Barney, the lat- ter especially, took good care to make known to him the position that all parties had held toward each other long ago. It was quite evident that Barney McAuley had speedily arrived at the determination of making " a night of it." His master was an open-hearted, honest American farmer, who, at an early date, appreciated the  faithful services of Barney McAuley. There were two other Irish servants engaged on the same farm; engaged, too, in consequence of Barney's integrity,-very often a recommendation, when those who are the cause of it are ignorant of the results of their own good behavior. An Irish piper was secured, although Barney McAuley had five miles to go, towhere the musician lived. He yoked a pony to a buggy in a few minutes, and asked Mary to accompany him. .Mary consented, if iley and Tim ac- companied them. Ailey was tired, at least she said so, and Tim thought the buggy too small for four.   Th/e Lost Rosary.       203 "Quite right," said Barney, as he forced Mary into the seat beside himself. "An hour and a-half," cried Bar- ney, as he darted away. It is very probable that Barney and Mary held a con- versation as he drove along the road. He was back at the appointed time, however, and had the prize he went for along with him. By the time he came back, a few of the servants, or more properly speaking, " help," from adjoining farms had gathered into the house, and in a short time were arranging with each other as to the best method of en- tertaining Barney McAuley, and his newly arrived friends. Mirth and jollity reigned supreme. Let them enjoy themselves as best they may. If ever long-divided friends were entitled to a bit of fun it was Barney McAuley and Tim Heggarty, in company with Mary and Ailey O'Donnell. They had much to talk about in the past, and hopes to forecast in the future, sorrow to lament, explanations to offer, plans to arrange, and a few, just a very few, visions of comfort and happi- ness to indulge in before they were realized. A deep- heaved sigh escaped from Barney at times as he saw the wonderful development of his faith and love-compan- ions of his toil by night and day. The same feeling of thankfulness pervaded all four, and further than that knowledge it is not fair for us to seek.   204       The Lost Rosary. "HAPTER XXj . MARRIAGE OF THE REV. EBENESWZER SOOKES TO HS -IN- T'JENuED WlFJb'S D AUGHTER-A--  BREACH OF PROMSE CASE. "Marriages are made in heaven, From which place all joys are given; But here is one of earthly make, And not for pure love's only sake.' A F W evenings only had passed when a crowd had gathered near to Mr. O'Meara's. The occasion was a wedding between the Rev. Ebenezer Sookes and"Helen" Clarkson. The " momentous question" which the rev. gentleman was so often on the point of putting to his housekeeper, Mrs. Clarkson, remained unspoken, till one evening, in the absence of her mother, the Rev. Ebenezer, in the fulness of his heart, and guided by what he pro- fanely urged to be a pure spirit, spoke the question to Nelly. The " pure spirit" that actuated Mr. Sookes might have been found in the coaxing ways of Nelly, and the slight disparagements that dutiful daughter cast upon her lonely parent. Miss Longhow mixed with the crowd,- and, wonderful to relate, spoke feelingly, and even kindly, to Mrs. Clark- son, who was also there. Some of those present were re- joicing at the happy nuptials of the minister and his housekeeper's daughter; others were present to shout themselves hoarse with indignity at the disgraceful con- duct, as they styled it, of a young woman marrying a man old enough to be her father. Nelly's mother, finding out what was soon to take place, left her situation, as her feelings would not per-   The Lost Rosary.       205 mit her to mix cogniac and Oolong for a man who was so forgetful of his promises. "But I'll make him re- member them yet-that I will," said Mrs. C. to Miss Long- bow. "And make him pay for his forgetfulness," said the outraged maiden lady, with as little anger visible as pos- sible in the tone of her voice.         "Git out o' this wid ye," said a policeman coming into the midst of the crowd, and bestowing a look of special recognition on Mrs. Clarkson and her companion, Miss Longhow. "Move aside, I tell yees," continued the man of peace. "' You wouldn't have the poor old man to commit thing- amy, wud ye, by marryin' the half o' the ould maids and widders as were runnin' him on to his ruin?" The crowd slowly dispersed, and as Miss Longhow cast a withering look at the window blinds, she muttered something half audibly, which made the " brute of a po- liceman" grin as if there wasn't an unhappy creature in the world. About a month after the marriage of his neighbor, Mr. O'Meara came in one evening, and as he sat down to tea in company with his wife, lifted up a newspaper, and, at the first glance he gave to it, burst out into an immoder- ate fit of laughter, which for some moments he was un- able to control, although pressed by his wife to explain the cause.            f A round of good hearty laughter is often infectious; it was so in this instance, for Mrs. O'Meara also laughed heartily, and her husband laughed again and again at his wife, who was utterly ignorant of the cause of his merriment. At length he managed to read from the pa- per he held in his hand the report of a case of Breach of Promise of Marriage, headed- CLARESON versus SOOKES. Damages were laid at $5000, and the jury, without re-   206,      The Lost Rosary. tiring, brought in a verdict for $100. The judge in giv- ing his award jocosely remarked that the majority of mothers would rather give their daughters a few hun- dred dollars as a marriage present, than seek to injure a son-in-law, as the plaintiff had done in that case. "He's none of my son-in-law," said Mrs. Clarkson. "I disacknowledge him for ever and ever;" saying which, that much aggrieved, much injured lady, left the court. The after career of Mrs. Clarkson was somewhat re- markable. She and Miss Longhow became fast friends, after a fashion. United in their scheme, they managed to make the place too hot for the Rev. Ebenezer Sookes; so that worthy, who married the daughter instead of the mother, betook himself and his blushing bride to pas- tures new. Many were the stratagems he was forced to adopt in order to obtain a livelihood. At one time he was a doctor; but, as he never managed to cure anyone, he changed from that profession to a lecturer, when he was oftener treated to " a beggarly array of empty box- es" than to audiences. After some years had passed, he obtained the pardon of his sister, who was rather well off in the world, and who assisted him by her influence and her money to obtain the charge of a small congre- gation, almost similar in character to the one he held at the time of his marriage. Nelly Clarkson, or, rather, Mrs. Sookes, never regretted her apostasy. When Moll Hanley came to hear all that happened in "Naiser "Nookes' house, she blessed God that He had tak- en poor Jenny to Himself before that poor girl became scandalized at the conduct of her sister, and the evil courses of her mother. An abiding friendship sprang up between Mrs. Clark- son and a number of women formerly benefitted by the ministrations of the Rev. Ebenezer Sookes. These formed themselves into an-association for the advocacy of Wom- an's Rights. Miss Longhow was induced to become act-   The Lost Rosary.       207 ing secretary, or secretaryess, to the society, and if the disappointment in love matters, which many of the mem- bers had suffered at the hands of thoughtless men, hurt them, they took their revenge in creating a good deal of noise in society. Mrs. Clarkson made vast improvements in picking up the usual -phrases used among her companions. She dressed as well as her circumstances permitted, and for a long time indulged the vain hope that chance or some- thing else would throw another Ebenezer in her way. But the fates opposed her wishes, and she took her re- venge accordingly, in denouncing men as " unprincipled demons," i' tyrants of the first and second water," and "irrational beings," who were as far below the sex of which she was a burning light and an ornament, as the earth was below the heavens. These women continued to get others as dissatisfied as themselves. They never could induce a good, edu- cated lady, married or unmarried, to mount rostrums with them--to join them in the propagation -of their disgusting principles, seeking to break up the holiest bonds that hold society together, and mouthing their in- famous doctrines to the disadvantage of decent, quiet women, who would suffer martyrdom rather than join with or encourage those whose poor vanity urges them into such deplorable exhibitions of themselves, making modesty blush at their pretensions, and elevating the loud-tongued to the disgust of all reasonable people, and to none more so than to ladies themselves. In private, the " ladies " of this modern cabal prove themselves, as a rule, to be no better than Mrs. Clarkson, or Miss Longhow, whose early life, if I had time to make it known, would go some way in accounting for the pro- clivities of that loud spinster. It was Saturday night, and Alick McSweeney was be-   208      The Lost Rosary. hind his usual time in coming home. His good wife wondered much at his absence. It was so unusual for Alick to remain out of his own house beyond the ap- pointed time of his return. Notthat Mrs. McSweeney begrudged Alick a spare hour when he wanted it, but that careful woman was afraid that something had hap- pened to her husband. In the midst of her cogitations, the ' man of the house " made his appearance in com- pany with a friend. There was an extraordinary sort of a twinkle in Alick's eyes as he entered. "Where have you been, and what in all the world kept you till this hour, Alick?" inquired his better half. "Well, old girl, as to where I have been, it's little use telling you, for I don't think you would know; as to what kept me, that's another thing, and as I always make it a practice to tell my wife the cause of my absence- not that I require to do so, but just--" "Just what, now, Alick?" said his good-natured wife. "Whyjust that I think it right to let her know." "Well, then, let me hear all about it." "That's just what I would rather keep you in suspense about, for awhile," said Alick. "Oh, botheration," said Mrs. McSweeney, with a pret- ty little pout upon her lips. "Well, botheration be it." "I'll tell you, myself," said the stranger," if he don't be quick about it. We were " "That'll do, now," said Alick. "Well, go on, yourself, if it's not a secret." "Who do you think did I see this evening?" said Alick, looking earnestly at his wife. "Gracious me 1 how could I tell." \ "Well, guess." "Really, I am sure I don't know, Alicke"   The Lost Rosary.       209 "Well, not to keep you longer waiting,--for 1 know what punishment it is to a woman to have her curiosity aroused, and not to gratify her as quickly as possible--" "Well, out with it," said Mrs. McSweeney, sharply. "There it is now. I told you how it would be," said her husband, evidently enjoying the growing uneasiness of his wife. "Oh, bless you, keep it; I'm sure I'm not caring one straw, Alick, either where you were, in whose company you have been, who you saw, or anything else." Alick enjoyed a good laugh, and then straightening himself up in his seat, said, "Well, I saw Tim Heggarty and Barney McAuley, and--" "You don't say so!" said Mrs. McSweeney, completely thrown off her guard in the matter of her womanish anxiety to know all about the little secret. "But I do say so," continued Alick, " and I say more, I saw their two sweethearts, Mary and Ailey O'Don- nell---" "Eh! what?" cried out Mrs. McSweeney. "Oh, if you won't listen, I'm sure I'm not bound to go on." "But I'm listening with both ears," insisted Alick's wife. "Aye, and talking at the same time," retorted Alick. "However, I saw both the boys and their girls; and now open your mouth wide, wide, wider. Both you and your husband-that's myself, I suppose--are cordially invited to both their weddings." "Both their weddings 1 " exclaimed the astonished wife of Alick McSweeney. "I have said it." "But don't you remember, Alick dear, that I men- tioned to you before about Ailey and Tim being second cousins?" "I remembered all about it, and spoke of it at once," "   210       The Lost Rosary. replied her husband; " and, by my word, it stunned both of the young men. I soon got the matter all explained. You meant the O'Donnells of the Grange, but Ailey isn't a drop's blood to one of them." "Then I'm  so glad", she repeated;" for that matter was lying heavy at my heart ever since the first moment I learned the name from Tim himself." "Oh, it's all right; and now, good wife, get that green silk dress made up at once, for the double marriage comes off on Monday next, at 12 o'clock. , There's a pow- er of quality to be there, and dear knows who besides' ." Mrs. McSweeney promised her readiness independent-  ly of the " quality,^ and so matters were arranged in that household that Mr. and Mrs. McSweeney should attend A the marriage of "Bernard McAtuley, Esq., to Mary, only a daughter of the late Cornelius O'Donnell, of Maghera- more, Clonmany, County  Donegal, Ireland;" also of "Timothy Heggarty, Esq., to Ailey OQ'Donnell, cousin of the first bride, at the same time and placed"       .            .

McSweeney was very glad and very happy to at- tend the invitation offered her, and especially as she had got her mind relieved of that very sad burden. The happy day at length arrived that was to witness a double marriage. Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara insisted that the weddings should be held in their house. This they lid in honor of a good and faithful servant, or, rather, ;ervants, for, although Ailey had been only a short time n her new place, yet short as the timewas, she hadprov- ed hergoodness of disposition, and her trustworthiness ,s a companion to Mrs. O'Meara, to e ntitle her to the re- pect shown to her on the part of those with whom she lad lately resided. "And remember," said Mr. O'Meara to Tim and Barney, I shall not feel happy as I other*ise- would, if you re- ain from inviting all your friendsjust in the same man- or as if your marriage festivities were held in any other lace." Both Barney and Tim returned their cordial thanks r the honor conferred on them. Alick lMcSweeney and his wife, together with oll nley and Mrs. lMc(1one, were the only parties invited. rney's master was spoken to for that purpose also, but   212       The Lost Rosary. his previous engagements did not permit him the pleas- ure of being present. In plainer terms, the previous engagements consisted of buying a neat little farm that adjoined his own, and concerning the purchase of which negotiations had been entered into before, on behalf of Barney McAuley. Barney had not sufficient funds to bring the bargain to a close. His master knew that, and now seeing the turn affairs had taken, determined to show his appreciation of Barney's past services by having a surprise for the newly married couple, and a surprise it really was; one, too, the indebtedness of which was never forgotten by Bernard McAuley, nor his wife, and every dollar of which was repaid with scrupulous exactness by him in whose behalf the kind action was performed. If Irish girls are seldom wanting in gratitude, neither are Irish boys, and especially those of them like our honest fellows, Barney McAuley and Tim Heggarty. "Invited to a weddin'!" said Moll Hanley, " an' in sich a house as Mr. O'Meara^s. Faith, an' it's myself has the right to be a proud woman, and you, too, Mrs. McGlone. Only to think of it, both of us seein' them two dacent fellows comin' over in the ship with us, an' their kind- ness in attendin' to the poor dyin' farmer. Och, to be sure, any one could have told that there was luck an' grace afore both of them." "An' are you actually determined to go?" asked Mrs. McGlone. "Arrah, is it fun you're makin'?" replied Moll; " would you have me to disgrace myself, and them too, by keep- in' away at such a time? 'Not I, indeed." "Idon't think I'll go," said Mrs. McGlone; but rm afraid that good woman said so either in order to tor- ment Moll, or-for the purpose of seeing if she could make her forego the pleasure of being present at the wedding.   The Lost Rosary.       213 "Troth, an' you'll go every inch of the way, an' take part in the bit of fun, so you will," said Moll, very de- terminedly. "An' who'll keep the house open?" asked Mrs. Mc- Glone. "Nelly Noonan must be present, you say, an' how can I go?" "The easiest way is the best way," maintained Moll -Hanley, "an' that's just to close the door dacently; an', indeed, I'm not sure but it's in a carriage we should go." "Ho,: ho!" cried Moll's companion, "ridin' in a car- riage, indeed; well, I'm sure I never " "Well, then, let us walk dacently, but go we'll go; " and they did go. The happy morning arrived that was to witness Mary O'Donnell and Ailey O'Donnell stand before the altar of God to pledge their troth, in fidelity and sanctity, to Bar- ney McAuley and Tim Heggarty. The young women were beautifully dressed in plain white dresses. Mrs. O'Meara had superintended that portion of the business, and was proud to find the taste of the girls in keeping with her own. Barney McAuley was " smiles all over," as Moll Han- ley afterwards described him. Tim was even paler than usual, and Barney maintained that the change in: Tim arose from the presence of Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara. The clergyman who performed the marriage service was a special friend of the O'Mearas, and the same for whom Tim had become " collector," from the first few weeks after he had landed in New York. Mass was said specially for the occasion, and after all was over, the clergyman was induced by Mrs. O'Meara to join the wedding party. That was a party; pleasant and joyful in the highest degree. Song, story, and sentiment, fun and frolic " till it was all hours;" and when Mrs. McGlone quietly hint- ed to Moll Hanley that it was time to retire, the latter   214       Tihe Lost Rosary. surprised all present by stoutly maintaining that Mrs. McGlone might go home if she felt so inclined, but for her own part "a step she wouldn't'budge from where she was until the whole affair broke up." Mrs. McGlone was half horrified at Moll's blunt man- ner. She had conveyed her hint in a sort of whisper, and did not intend that others should know what she meant. A good hearty roar of laughter followed the an- nouncement of Moll Hanley's determination. Barney McAuley danced with Mrs. O'Meara, Tim danced with Moll Hanley, Mr. O'Meara had the honor of "leading out" both brides in turn, and, to crown everything, Moll's health was proposed, in fine flowing terms, as one of the truest-hearted women in America. Moll was near crying at hearing herself spoken of in such a manner, and be- fore such fine company. Tim Heggarty responded for Moll, and Alick McSweeney could not resist the tempta- tion of following in the same line, although it soon be- came evident that the last speaker wished for an oppor- tunity to speak in terms -of praise of Mrs. McSweeney. The trick was easily seen through, and Alick's wife col- ored deeply as the tongue of her husband unloosed itself in her praise. It was a small fault, if fault it could be called. And now, good reader, permit me to drop the scene for a few minutes, and to raise it again after an imagin- ary lapse of nearly twenty years. Mr. O'Meara had induced Tim Heggarty to join his fortune with Barney McAuley. The latter did so, and continued for three years an inmate of Barney's house. There was a particular happiness thus afforded to Mary and Ailey, who, although very anxious that Tim, should take Mri O'Meara's advice, yet did not venture their opinion in a matter of such moment,   The Lost Rosary.       215 A slight estrangement took place between Barney and Tim, that caused them to be well laughed at by Mrs. McAuley and Mrs. Heggarty. Tim had laid a wager with Barney, that Mary's first child would be a girl. Tim won, and insisted on full payment of the wager, which consisted of a dress to Moll Hanley and one to Mrs. Mc- Glone. Barney did not begrudge the fulfilment of the wager, but he did feel considerably piqued at Tim win- ning, for he had determined to call his first-born after Timothy Heggarty. He could not readily do that, so he did the next best thing--he called the child MARY-and its mother hung a ROSARY around its neck at the time of baptism. The young woman who stood sponsor for little Mary McAuley was from the same part of Ireland that Mrs. McAuley was from. When she saw the Rosary around the child's neck she trembled, and got as pale as death. The clergyman observed her, and instantly placed her in a seat. She was soon enabled to describe the cause of her excitement. A lady met her one even- ing when coming from the Sunday-school at the Old Chapel of Clonmany, and presented her with the same Rosary, which the lady had found lying on the road. She accepted it, and preserved it afterwards. During her sickness in a public hospital, a young woman endeavor- ed to take it from her, but she resisted the attempt, and succeeded in retaining it. One evening when walking through a cemetery at New York, she knelt down at a grave to repeat a prayer. At the head of the grave stood a beautiful Cross of sculptured marble, and inscrib- ed with one word, "MOTHER." It was that which had attracted her. There she had lost her beads, and never saw them till that moment. Mary had never mentioned the loss of the Rosary to her husband. She had con- sulted Alley on the same matter, and she gave it as her opinion that " it would neither do good nor harm in not speaking of the loss." Mary had some childish feeling   216       The Lost Rosary. that if Barney knew that she had lost the Rosary that belonged to his mother, he might probably'look up- on her as careless, and so the matter had passed away until revived by the circumstance here related. Tim Heggarty and his wife had heard of the whole oc- currence, and it is right to state that when both of the men had learned the particulars of Mary's heroic con- duct in attending on strangers in the fever hospital, that their admiration of the noble girl was a thousand fold increased. Both Mary and Ailey had long since made known the chief trials and difficulties both had undergone since the time when Barney and Tim had sailed for America; but whatever related to their heroism they studiously with- held. They did not do so from any desire fo keep any- thing secret, but from a principle of innate modesty. Both had known themselves to be faithful and true in small things, but did not care to blazon forth such things, even to their husbands. They were right. "Give that poor fellow a few days' work," said Tim to Barney one morning. "No; hang me, Tim, if I can get over the scoundrel's villany." "Do you call that manly or fair?" asked Tim. "Don't bother me now about what is fair or manly. He did a thing that caused many a pang to you and me, and to others whom we both devoutly-love, and I never can forgive him." "Nonsense I " said Tim. "The affair is past and gone, and forgiveness is a glorious bit of revenge. Come, Bar- ney, let us forget his past errors. Give me your hand, old boy; our luck has been good; it won't lose anything in future by forgetting the misdeeds of the poor fellow, especially as things came all right afterwards." Barney had to yield. It was not Tim's powers of per- suasion, so much as that hint that "things came all right afterwards."   The Lost Rosary. -      217 This conversation took place in regard to an unfortu- nate Irishman whom Barney and Tim had taken a lik- ing to shortly after their arrival, and to whom they had entrusted the small matter of posting letters homeward. After Barney's marriage, he had learned that the letters sent to Mary and Ailey had been destroyed, for the pur- pose of retaining the small amount of postage given with each letter., It is right to state that Mary and Ailey felt this mat- ter even more keenly than did either Barney or Tim; but all was past, and their tender hearts were the ablest seconders of Tim's proposal that the affair should be forgotten. Barney yielded, and lived to prove the future fidelity of him who had thus been the cause of many a bitter sorrow to those whose love for each other had been broken by such petty means. Time rolled on, and Moll Hanley became proprietor of the boarding-house formerly owned by her and Mrs. McGlone. Moll's companion was dead and buried, and Nelly Noonan, the innocent cause of much trouble to "Helen "Clarkson dong since Mrs. Sookes), became the inseparable companion of Moll Hanley, who, although advanced in years, appeared to hang together so well, that those who knew her prophesied that Moll wouldn't die as long as she could help it. Mr. and tlrs. O'Meara had long since betaken them- selves to quiet repose. Little Mary had grown to be a fine young lady. Father and mother were very fond of her, and the daughter was fond of both. She came to learn the sad -history of Alice McGrain, and Mary's heart turned warmly towards God. She became a Sister of Mercy, and, during the late American war, "Sister Gene- vieve " might have been seen on the battle-fields of Vir- ginia, attending the wounded and dying, with a warmth of devotion that Catholic Faith could alone inspire.   218      The Lost Rosary. Tim Heggarty had a fine family of one boy. Barney McAuley had a finer family 'of nine children; and, in his humorous moments, when tormented by Tim Heggarty, used to say that he had a family of some ten or eleven children--"Mary could tell the exact num- ber, but he was hanged if be could tell the half of them." CONCLtUSION. "GOOD-MOmNING, O'Leary." "Good-morning, Mac." "( Still at work, I see." "Well, I'm just finishing that story that your con- founded impudence induced me to undertake." "You flatter me, old boy." "Well, believe me, Mac, I hadn't the slightest inten- tion of committing such an act as flattering you." "Have you considered the right of women to advocate their rights?" " "Yes." "Then you'll agree with me, that Miss Longhow was pursuing a wise and proper course in coming boldly be- fore the public, and threatening to strike at the root of those forms of society that keep women in the back- ground of the world, and give to men the supremacy of race?" "I happen to know Miss Longhow's antecedents, and I can assure you that her present course is chiefly dic- tated by revenge. She was disappointed in marriage, and then turned her attention to the abuse of that state at which she unfortunately could not arrive." "And you are really of that opinion?" "Most decidedly." "At all events, I hope you have acted fairly towards-   The Lost Rosary.       219 the sex, O'Leary. It would be very ungallant of an Irish- man to doiotherwise." "Trust me, Mac. I'm all right there. I have acted fairly enough towards one and all. I have shown by a kind of negative process the way to win 'Women's Rights,' as they are falsely termed." "What do you mean?" "I mean that I have shown the good side and bad side of ordinary female character in America, that in adher- ing to a line of truth as the basis of a story, I have, I hope, managed to point out ways to go and ways to avoid, especially for those new to the place." "And is that your way of cutting up the Woman's Rights Association?" "The very way. There are more ways of killing a dog than by hanging him." "Yes, I know; but I thought you would have gone more directly to that work." "Show a woman what we men admire most in another woman, and a thousand chances to one she will perform that which we admire. Prove to them that the sweet, retiring nature of modesty wins upon us, and conquers us, and she will quit her brawling and screaming on pub- lie platforms." "Faith, I think you are right there." "I have drawn some characters of a truly noble nature, such as I have known them, who suffered much, and only got purified the more they suffered. Their faith and hope never failed them, and they lived to enjoy life, and to do good to others, both by their own example and otherwise." "I know to whom you allude. By-the-by, O'Leary, pitch nonsense overboard, and obtain an introduction for me to Miss McAuley." "Are you serious, Mac?" "Quite serious, I assure you."   220      The Lost Rosary. "But consider your refined tastes and habits, and then think of that red-faced girl, and her arms .the color of carrots." '"Oh, nonsense I you understand me perfectly well." I knew Mac's good heart after all, and procured him an invitation to Miss Mary McAuley; as sweet and as handsome a young lady as ever passed before your eyes. She was rather tall, but her every movement indicated the woman of worth, the lady of mind, tender and true in her character, the idol of her happy parents, the be- loved of her family. Her mother did not thank me for my interference. It resulted in a marriage; and Mrs. McAuley gave a sly glance at me one 'morning when I called and complimented her on being a grandmother. She knew that I was aware of the whole history of her life,-and that when I then spoke to her she was the equal, in point of worldly wealth and social position, to any lady around her. Tim Heggarty and his wife Ailey were a happy pair. The good acts performed by them would fill a volume. Patrick Hegarty, their only son, was just ordained a priest in time to celebrate the marriage ceremony be- tween my friend Mac and his beautiful young wife. I was present at the wedding, having left my old machine of an arm-chair for that very thing, and kept this story unfinished for the purpose of recounting that important event., During the festivities, we had many a joke, and many a happy word to say about our Irish girls. "Here's success attend- them, one and all," were the last words I heard at the wedding. Inwardly I said--A ww. THE END.
