INTRODUCTI2
The year 181constitited an important ris s in the io r
of Ohio. The war of this period, opened to ems tio s.nd
enterprise, the  great area west'   6the Alle  es. The
ai-mies st out to battle with Indians ad other"  ofs,fo e
banksa of the Wabash, theIllinois, the Detrotth  e4 t
Miami of the Lakes, and other rivers, opened forobsevatiod,
attractive scenes for settlement.
Ohio particularly, at this period, was looked 'upon as the
garden of the West, Prior tos the war but few setttments.
had been made in the North-Western region: but as soon as
peace was made, a coxitinual tide of emigration was seen
moving westward.
At the period of the opening of on narrative, the territory
now comprised in Richla~nd Ahland, and Morarw counties,
was almost an unbroken wilderness. Th  present .h}i-rng
City of Mansfield then contained only two or three }cabins and
a couple of block houses, which were erected in the tonth
of September of this year. There was also a cabin on the
Barkdoll farm, and a block house at Beams now C  bell')
mill., There *ere  few farms opened along the' B a k  irk,
and a few at Lexington, and along the Clear Fok' Supplies
of provisions &amp;c., were',lpacked fromi Mt.  Veron Knox
county, on horseback, a feat attended  ith no' rte : nger
as the wilderness then was tenanted 'by Ili ns and wil
beasts.
The Indian tribes holding possession of Ohio at this t'wer
were the Shawnees, Wyandots, Miamis, Pinkashaws,      1S a+
wares, Eries, Winnebagoes, and some portions of the, '
Nations. The Shawnees are said to be the oldest inhabitants
this State.

INTRODUCTION.
Among the tribes which inhabited this region of Ohio,
were the Delawares and Wyandots. A settlement of Dela-
wares existed at Greentown, on the Black Fork, and one at
Jeromerille, now in Ashland county. These Indians professed
friendship for thewhites, andi up t01 18'2they had lived
amicably with 14hni.
Among the Indian chiefs friendly to the American cause,
was Captain'Pipe of Jeromeville, who previous to the treaty
of Greenville in -79,was the most inveterte enemy ofrthe
whites.        .
Tecumerih his b    her the Prohet were the leadingi
s'p's arrae          against the ew 4e settlement ,a
tlroe their influence many a cheerful cabin hearth was
made desolate

shrub, sparkled in the morning sunbeams, like
a glittering jewel. Overhead gay plumaged song-
sters flitted from branch to branch, pouring
forth their morning _songs, and the wild bee
basked in the sunlight, now sipping the nectar
from the flowers, and now alighting upon some
pendant leaf to pick a dainty morsel. Every ob-
ject around the young hunter was filled with beau-
ty, and inspired his -soul with the most pleasing
emotions, and every sound that fellrupon his ear
was filled with diFinest, sweetestinelody.
Philip was one of the most powerful and athlet-
ic men of his day. None ventured to cope with
him in wrestling, or in other feats of strength.-
His countenance wasradiant with the genial smiles
of a warm and generous heart, while his bright
eye flashed with the impulse of a noble and manly
courage. He was the only son, the joy and pride
of his parents, who bestowed every care their means
afforded upon his moral and intellectual culture.
His parents were old and infirm, and the duty of
supporting them in their declining yearsageyoling
upon him, he becameof necessity a hieit,' and
dearly did he love this:wild and exciting life. H'is
rifle was his constant companion, and lo was never
oredeighted than when in the pursuit of
BFt the Indians, though apparently friend,

nearmIg the edge of the swamp, he secretedhim.
self. behind the trunk of a huge foresttree which
the giant tread of the infuriated wlds had upr9ot-
ed.  Philip hid reniained in this psition but a
few moments, when his attention  was arrestedhy
a rustling noisee among the thick bushes of the
swamp. a [na few moments the bushes parted,aid
a huge blackbear came peerng through. ?hilip,
ing hi8 rifle upon a log, lired, and the .monster
tell, quivering in 'the agonies of death. lmost,
instantly with the discharge of Philip's rice,rang
the sharp crack of another through the forest, the
bail of which struck the tree a few 'inches below
where Philip's rifle rested. At this sudden ated
unlooked for report, Philip started to his feet,aid
looking in the direction from which the sou d pro..
ceeded, discovered a savage, about one, htindred
yards from him in an opposite dir section acio'wthe
swamp, on a small elevation, which' for soire dis-
tance overlooks the swamp.
Philip on seeing the savage sprang behind a
tree, and re-loaded with the utmost speed. The
Indian on seeing him thus preparing for ntaien
counter with. him, threw down his rifle and tona-
hawk, and holding up his hands, ran towardshimt
with as niuch haste as possible, exclaiming; appa-
rently much frightened--" Me no shoot you! me
no shoot at you! me no kill you !"
Philip lowered his rifle,.and the Indiary coming
up, with earnest.gesticulatip s, reiterate4-." Me
,Griy  na ao hurt yqufme like you-nelike all

"Kanotche lies !" said Philip, eyeing him sterm-

Philp. He, however; protested h~ innocence of
esi i intent, saying:r
Kanotche shoot at bear. Kanotche see no white
mAn" --and to prove'his sincerity tendered his as-.
sistance in' securing Philip's prize. Philip, pre-
terilng that his suspicions were removed, accepted
it; and' such portions of the bear %as were of' value
were conveyed to Philip's cabin.  A good supper
s prepared for Kanotche by Kate, Philip's sister,
and the 'Indian departed.
IKate Seymour was an only daughter,-a rosy
cheeked, bright eyed lass, just =eighteen, of a gay,
laughing',disposition, whose glances were incendiai
vies,:dangerous to the peace of the gallant swains
who came within their range.
yfer tha departure of the Indian, Philip narra-
ted the adventures-of the day. " I tell you, Kate,"
said he, in a lively tone, "Old Kanotche was 'a good
medicine for bad blood about that time, he started
:h circulation a little more -lively than I ever felt
lyfo e."
:Ah, but Phil, I'm afraid he meant you no good.
Ilon't 'believe it was a mistake."
:Teith  do I," said Mrs. Seymour: I do wish,
Mr.Saymour, you'would take us all up to Mansfield
till the war is over. Those Indians are so treach-
e,L don't feel safe.
hh! pooh! mother," said Mr. Seymour, "don't
b scared at nothing   Kanotche is , good friend

fully, "if you had been shot? How thankful I am
you are safe."
" Oh-Harry would take my place, you know.-
you would not miss me."  And Philip looked at
Kate roguishly, and she blushing, jumped up and
playfully boxed his ears. Philip dodged, and they
were just getting into one of their pleasant frolics
when the door opened, and before the astonished
family stood a young emigrant to Ohio,

And n'owit is    t   te   edc   to know who

Henry Monroe was a young Pennsylvanian Ffrom
the same neighborhood whence the Seymours had'
come   Many a day he had swung Kate upon the
gr  ie swing, near the school house, and many
an  a prudent lad he had punished for presuming
to claim any of Kate's attentions. Thus they grew
u    ' together;- of her he dreamed day and night,
a id when Kate's parents noved to Ohio, he of all
others suffered most at parting. Nor was this re-
gaid unrepaid, for Kate actually thought, him the
 bravest and handsomest boy in school, except
hilip  Since the removal of the Seymours to
hio, Henry had suinoned courage sufficient
to write a letter to Philip, but somehow or oth-
er itvas al to or about Kate, so that Philip threw

itito her slap and saidThere Kate, I did not
mean to open your letter, but 2ank misdir ptedit!"
Andof .course, as Philip would not answer it, com-
on -politeness required Kate to write d say
something in reply, and so *ery thought hemyst
avsyer; Kate's kind lette', and thsu letters  d
pased fersorne months,until Henry thought it49pk
too much writing to say so little, and so one day
he packed his knapsack, strapped it .on li back
and battedd for Ohio, witl enough' mony to eer

1onients when he saw the heads of two Indians
peering over the bank. Presently one- of theirs
cautiouly drew himself up and examined Henry's
caup. Satisfied that there had been but one per-
0x1 in the camp and that he was quietly sleeping,
both took deliberate 'aim at the supposed sleeper
and fired. Up to this instant Henry was quite
nervous, but now his nerves were as firm as steel,
and as the Indians sprang-forward with wild whoops
andraised tomahawks hey shot the first through the
head' and before 'the second could recover from his
ast nistre't 'he dealt him'ia blow oveir the scaip
with his .clubbed' rifle.' The savage staggered and
fell but sprang ipand staggered to the bank where
arsecond blow from Henry knocked himinto the
rapid current. This first experience of life in the
wilderness,'nst effectually drove' sleep from
Heny. He strapped his knapsack and following

he now found to Abe oly1 i his imagination. Most
anxiously he sought the river but found no sign.-
At the rising of the: spin. he set his face directly
eastward s-he knew thathe was on the west side

he leaped, the enclosure and sat down by a spring
which gushed forth from the bkank en- the --south

knapsack.
"I wonder whose nursery this is," thought he.-
d1 didn't come here by chance, that's sure; 'hllo.
More Indians ? They missed mefor supper and

into a thicket' 'of apple trees and listeue  I  a

HENRY MONROE-ADVENTURE W1T RUFFNER.

"He eat alone,
And silent, on a fallen tree,
And, gazed upon
The waters gliding by."
lOQR several days subsequent to the
JLevents narrated in the previous
chapter, Phil p7' Seymour made it his
business to traerseathe country for
og around for the purpose of ascer-
taing thedposition of the Indians and
the probabiKties of their making an at-,
ktasck Un the settlements; but so far
as he could learn" all 'danger' had disap-
peared, and Philip began to flatter him-
self that his fears had been groundless,
and that he had in fact' entirely misin-
terpreted the occurrences which had
previously excited his suspicions.
Henry Monroe in 'the 'meantime had made a for-
m aTproffer of his heart and hand'to the gentle
Kate, and was now  n accepted lover. The. time
for the wedding was appointed, and Henry having
made a purchase of a quarter of land, on the ,Black
Fork, a short distance below the Seymours', where-
upn tor settle with hisbride, returned to his friends
inoniesylvania, in order to make his arrangements

2T

for a final emigration to his new home in the wil-
derness.
On the day. following the- departure of Henry,
Philip, anxious for another adventure in the woods,
and  feeling lonesome in the absence of his friend,
took up his rifle, and bidding the family good morn-
iug, sallied out into the wilderness justas the un
was appearing in all its golden glory.
F or hours Philip wandered through the forest
without finding any object worthy of his attention:
There was anabundance of inferior game in-the
woods but this did .not come within the purview of
this dlay's adventure. He wished to have another
encounter with a'bear, wolf, or wild cat, but oild
not get a glimpse of any of these.
-   gSomewhat fatigued and weary,Philip at length
sat himself down upon the green banks of the mur-
muring stream that flowed through the forest,,ind
for ,a while sat gazing in a dreamy listk  less
upon the wild scene around him.In I  slii e
his eyelids gre" heavy, and hefelf dt did
sleep, from which he did not awaken, till h ad

THE MURDER OF GIBBS AN] BUEL.
"'Twas death to tarry, and 'twd*ath to fly
Death bared his weapon, with 'terrific alight
And all was desolation."-ANNYiious.
Before following up 'the adventures of" Ruffner,
on the evening he left the cabin .of Seymour, we
propose to lay before the reader a condensed his-
tory of the murder referred to in the preceding
chapt '
Tw :buners -named Gibbs: and  hel Itad built
then        small log cabin, bout one mile from
Sand     bay,ft bout;one mil-3.S ]: I ofte present

pursuits.
TWo Indians named Omic and Semo, belonging
to th'e Ottawa tribe, frequently passed by this cab-
i, 'on their way to'the mouth of the Huron river,
where they exchanged their venison and furs for
powder, lead, tobacco, whiskey &amp;c. -Forming an
actaintance with Gibbs and Bue!, they made this
asbin their stopping place over night-. One night
lbout, two o'clock, these savages came to this cabin
highly intoxicated, zkaaking a tremendous. uproar,

and demanding admittance, but fearing thtthey
would kee up their noise all night;,theyere a4

menced a general "pow wow."     Gibbs orde d
them to keep quiet or quit the cabi  Th     i-
sed to do either. Whereupon theyjwere knoie,
down and dragged out.
The Indians 'then withdrew from the 'house, and
nothing was heard of them for one or t7o: days}
when they returned perfectly sober, and in a friend-
ly manner, making no allusion to their former
treatment; this was done to remove all suspsiown a
to their intentions. They returned again in thp
night of the same day, and requested  permission
to stay all night, which was 'immed el granted
as before.  Gibbs and Iuel went to bed, ra  e

of blood about it. He entered the cabin, and the
firstobjeut which met his astonished gaze was the
body of Bue which had been thrown head fore-
nost,,downa kind of cellar in the riddle of the
loor, his feet projecting abov . He immediately
returned to the settlement, and communicated his
discovery to the settlers, whereupon a party of
eight oiten set out in pursuit of the murderers,
first stopping at the ill-fated cabin.
An examination of the body of Buel, revealed
the f-act of his head being split open-his legs bro-
ken, and the point of a spear still remaining in his
head. The company who knew the Indians 'recol-
lected that 'Omic usually carried a spear with him
while on his trading expeditions to 'Huron. They
extracted the spear from the head 'of Buel, preser-
vig it for future reference. A .search for the
body oftGibbs now commences. They soon discov-
ered his trail acting him by his blood' and foot
prints.] From the incredible distance of his leaps,
he= ab eyidntly much frightened. his body was
found aceorssthe prairie, about sixty 'rods'in front
of thee  i on the edge of the underbrush. A
ball ha4 e ttredhis' bak and lodged in his left
beast.  lihiarms were nearly cut off, and he
was otherwise dreadfully mangled. The ball was
takenfro his body and also preserved
The next adventure was to obtain a clue to the~
4iyrderers. It was knownthat these Indians had
ofn -ldgeddwith Gibbs and Buel, and : the point
o theperi3found in the head of Buel, resembled
the one carriedbyrQmic. :These considerations
ue   the company to fasten their susicions.
upon Seno and Omic.
".      .iey Were consequently pursued to the mouth
aian riverwheretheTboat was made fast, and
W     hites ezept on, secr-eted themselves,
hiethis 'one w11iwas well acquainted with the
rins,"wnt up the'eiiver to where Semo and Omic

resided.  He found Omic a short distanceup the
river, having in his possession the remaining part
of the spear, with which he had killed Buel. He
succeeded in persuading him down the river, under
pretence of going with him on a hunting expidi-
tion; 'and at .the, moment he reached the, spot
where the' boat-lay, the secreted'party sprung up,
on him, and secured him with ropes. He was taken
to Cleveland, tried, found guilty, and executed.
Semo was next demanded of his tribe. At first
they refused to give hin up, but on being satisfied
of his guilt they.consented to do so. 'A delegation
was sent to receive him. The savage on finding
that he was to be delivered into the hands of his
enemies, asked permission to say a few words to
the company. It was granted him; and he arose.
He was a tall, well built man,-and somewhat grace-
ful in his movements. Every eye was fixed upon
him, and every ear was open to heArwhat 'he 'had
to say.
"My brothers," said the savage  me    Gibbs
with my pistol-me kill many pale face n.ekill
more if me could. You say Sem     u    with

Then casting his dark ,iercing ee4     Qpon
the whites who sat sole Aistance ;froniIire he
stood, he paused for a moment. The'glance of hip
eye was fearfully wild, and his grave and sullen
countenance, gave indications of his cchamitting
some act of desperation. He drew from his bes~m
his pistol. A death like silence pervaded ti~e as-
sembly. Fearing that his vengeance wasp aboutto .
fall upon some one present, the Indians around'him
were about to rush upon him to, disarm biu

We shall now leave the Seymour family to the
enjoyment of a comfortable nights rest, and fellow
up ,the adventures of the Dutchman, after"leving

over the forest. Advancing cautiously a short dis-
tance further, the sounds became more audible.
"Py tam," mentally ejaculated the Dutchman, as
a loud yell broke upon his ears, "vbolvs py shupi-
ter." In an instant another frightfully mingled
howl rent the air, some distance in the. forest be-
hind him, which was answered by those in the
swamp with no less unmusical vehemence. Ruffner
was alone- darkness was around him, and a fearful
foe under cover of. that dyakness had, surrounded
him.
Nearer and still nearer came the advancing band
of midnight marauders, and at every bound their
horrible yells broke in upon the forest. It was
evident that the pursuing gang had scented his
tracks. As the yellsof this gang were borne to
those in, te swamp, the latter answered with no
les appalling sour d  Ruffner's indecision at this
critical period' was but momentary, he sprang into
the branches:of a tree standing a few steps from
him, but''scarcely had he secured this position,
when the whole gang surrounded the tree, and in a
inoment were joined by thosein'te swamp. Then'
commenced- scene of howling grd yelling which
bdfiles all description. Not lessthan tW  score of
these loathsome and nsightly creaturesimingled
theirwild yells in '"horrid'harmony."   it ap-
peared to R4ner, that every onmoment their yelling
grew louderfndmore horrio"    occasionally they
would make theiost desperateleaps towards the
branches of the tree as if determined to spring
upon their intended victim, and' devour' him 'soul
and body. But finding that they could not succeed'
in their attempts,' they became'more furious; and
their yells more "horrible at every failure. But
tfitl they would not leave the spot.
'Riie h sataitiong the"branches of the tree
looking down upon the heart-chilling scene around
him. The glaring eyeballs~ of the infuriated band

of wild beasts, shone like :coals of fire,.as they
prowled around the tree,naking night hideous With
their wild orgies. Thus, l.e sat for some Morgents;
he was beyond their reaeh but not ou of their
sight and hearing. At first.our hero was somewhat
agitated, but finding himself beyond the power of
their devouring jaws he became enraged.
"Vot," said he, half. aloud, "Vill, these  evilish
puggars schase me on ter dree,un den keep up ter
voolish parking it a noise more as like vild tevils?
Py schings I vill shtop some of ter troats."
Examining his "bouch," he found it well supplied
with bullets. He then commenced to open his
battery from the tree, firing upon them at every
opportunity with much success. On the first fire
a death yell from one of their number told that the
ball had taken effect. In this way he kept up his
fire till near midnight. After he had. killed aid
wounded several of them,- they retreated to a
greater distance from the tree, still keeping up a
continuous howling, It was near the hour of mid-
night, and the moon was just pushing up her
modest face, before the wolves showed any signs
of retreating. But at length their howling died
away in the distance.
The moon had now begun to cast her light upon
the forest. Ruffner descended, and on examina-
tion found he had actually shot ten of the*number,
some of which were not dead; these he instantly
dispatched, and taking theit acalps proceeded on
his way to his cabin, where. he arrived in a short
time. Next morning he visitedthe spot where he
encountered the wolves, and found by the traces of
blood and other marks that he had wounded prob-
ably as many as he had killed. Returning to his
cabin, he remained there a few days making.. pre-
parations for the proposed 'hunting gxcursioncl
.It may not be improper to notice- in the conclu-
sion of thin chapter, that Ruffner had under his jii-

age.' 'The original name of this lad was, William
Buntley, but when he came under the care of our

from the circumstance that' he was 'thick sete nd

very kind to the boy, and proffered to'take hin to

that he could'take care of himself.

This region, at the time ,of which we write, was
beautifully wild and romantic, containing an abun-
dance of wild game. Bears, wolves, wild cats deer
and raccoons, were more numerous here than in
any other region of the country; this was owing
to the greater abundance of rocky dens and deep
ravines, affording them  a more secure retreat.
Philip was much pleased at the location,, and ex-
pressed his determination to make this a camping
ground for the night, Here the clear sparkling
waters rolled over'the pebbly bottom with a rip-
pling sound, which minled with the melody of the
feathered songsters, anithe ham of wild bees, sip-
ping their sweets from each tiny flower, conspired
to fill the soul of Philip with the ivelest e motions.
He gazed with delight upon the enchanting scene
around him, and seating himself upon the bank of
the stream,iidulged in ,a, few moments meitation
and solilquy;. sometimes repeating alu4. the
thoughts that arse in his mind. Ruffrer b4 9jA-

answer this question. It is enough for us to know
that just such occurences as we have related are by
no means rare in the experiences of pioneer life.--
Many such instances are left upon record in the
lives of western hunters. We could mention sev-
eral, but will not presume upon the intelligence of
the reader.
After our heroes had despatched the two ser-
pents as already mentioned, they proceeded to the
shanty, which they had forsaken in the evening.
Here they were no little astonished at finding that
they had actually taken shelter upon a den of rat-
tlesnakes; for on removing the shanty and clearing
away the rubbish, their ears were greeted with the
music of this species of the snake family. The bat-
tie soon commenced in earnest, and for two long
hours were our heroes engaged in killing enormous
reptiles.  Philip showed himself a master hand
at the business, and Ruffner fairly roared with
laughter, at witnessing the dexterity of the snake.
hating Philip, and every now and then amusing
him with some Dutch drollery.
Assoon as the work of snake extermination had
b een completed, the two hunters continued th eir
journey down the banks of the Clear. Fork, until
they arrived at the spot where Newville now stands.

HUNTING EXCURSION -INDIAN CABIN-AN ADVENTURE.
 "Oh let me climb those gay clad hills,
Rough,.ruygged though they be,
And nestle by the shady rills,
Or'neath the shady tree.
Ascending the high cliff which overlooks thiM
village, the romantic Philip set himself down ug'n
a moss covered rock.
The morning was beautiful and all nature looked
gay and smiling. The mingled melodies of a hpmu
sand songsters, rang upon' the morning air, To
Philip, the scene appeared the: more delightiu as
he contrasted it with the dreamy horrors of4the
past night. Philip's anticipations of the grand and
beautifull were fully realized. Below him was spread,
ouf the interminable forest-the variegated land-
scape. He had left Ruffner in the valley below, and
he was now by himself on the'highest point of the
bluff, free ,to revel in his own imaginations..
"The forest, the mighty forest ! howit inspires
the mind with emotions too big for utterance  ,
Thousands and thousands of acres, covered with
the most luxuriant Negetation through which brigh-
sparkling waters roll; and on whose banlds are saa
the blending colors of the 'vast family of flowedi
shrubs, and blooming wild flowers. Man may bf}

greatness, and 'what is he? An insect--a worm--a
mere nothing, scarcely discernible on the grand
panorama of nature. Place the crimsoned robed,
and. diamond decked monarch, even upon this infe-
rior pinacle, then talk to him of power, greatness
and glory-tell him to command and he shall be
obeyed, and he will feel that your words are mere
mockery." The sharp crack of a rifle broke in upon
the young man's reveries, and casting his eyes be-
low him, he discovered a full grown buck, making
lis way up the hill with 4the 'utmost speed, in a'
direct line to where he sat. Philip grasped, his
rifle and sprang behind a tree. As the animal
nea i'the spot where the young man stood, having
somewhat slackened his speed, he discharged his
rifle and the beast gave otie desperate leap into the
air, fell backwards, and expired. The ball had
pierced his heart.,

upon' the confines of a dense thicket whih tIey
entiere and to their no small astonishment found
a' slitary cabin, vei rudely constructed.* - On en-
tering it ,they found that it was uninhabited,
though bearing marks of having recently been oeN
cupied.
"Vot doh till dish mean!" inquired Ruffner. "Py
shines dish a leetle Inshun house."
"Ah!" said Philip, smiling; "why may it 'not be a

"'Datish it-dat ish it," replied' the Dutchnan;

"But there isa no, time to lose, here, Ruffinr,"
said Philip, ' w ntust look for game" and.o scyintg
the hunters left' the cabin. Retracing their steps,

upon the forest; and yet oir heroes knew      not
wherx.tog'est for the night. In a few moments,
howeve, they caught the sight of  a,,ledge of rocks,
at the head of a deep ravine, and proceeding to
te~sthey discovered a spacious opening, which
running some distance under afforded an; ample
shelter. Having examined the cavern,if such it
may be named, and finding no visible signs of wild
beasts or reptiles, they determined to shelter here
till morning; necessary preparations were accor-
dingly made, and the.- hunters laid down,. But
their slumbers were, frequently disturbed during
the night by the hideous yells of piao6ling wolvgs,
which were enjoying a rich repast on the bodies
of the slain animals.
Morning once more dawned upon the forest;
and with the " early tints of opening day" our
hunters- were astir.   Leaving the cavern, they
proceeded in a north-easterly direction for sever-
aL miles untithey came in sight of a considerable
edge of rocky bluffst. This ledge of rocks is sit-
uated on the road leading now from Washington to
Newville, and near . the residence of Mr. John !T.
Douglas. All things considered they form a most
magnificent and remarkable rocky structure,
Our hunters were soon upon these heights, en-
joying  the hury of a cool and salubious morning
air. To Philip the prospect was one of no little
interest-; and although this humble locality could
not be brought ,in comparison with the garden
vales of Neosha, or the alluvial prairies of Kansas,'
yet t6 his view the prospect was no 'less beautiful.

of the forest had stood, inspired with the spirit of
unobstructed freedom.
"How beautiful is nture," exclaimed tl e roman-
tic young hunter, while Ruffner sat smoking his
pipe, u conscious of the beauties around hin-
"How   beautiful is nature," repeated he, "the
green  earth, the blue heavens, and the wide
spreading forest.  Whether we gaze upon the
mountain's summit, the spray washed shore of old
ocean,:or the flower decked plains, all, all are beau-
tiful and inspiring.  Cast our eyes oyer nature
where we may and a thousand interesting objects
meet our vision. Whether we iten to the low
breathings of the gentle zephyrs, or the frightful
detonations of the bellowing tempest-the glaring
lightning's flash, or the soft and transient lightof
the passing meteor-the iniitable radience of the
many eglored rainbow, orthe evanescent corrusca-
tions of the ever changing aurora-yet in all tlese
we cannot help feeling the highest degree of holy
veneration. Whether we gaze, spon the limpid
waters eof the clear runnin  brooks which trickle
over grass and pebbles alQng their flower strewn
banks,or upon the feaif'ul precipitations of the
awe inspiring catarfe, or the foaming surges of
the sunless deep-ve are ineither case constrain-
ed to acknowledge the sublime teachings of nattae
sowice of infinite gratification  and he whose
soul is so luggish as not to be able to realize such
a overpowering sense-of the beautiful and subliji

that were making theirway towards the..pot
where our heroes weresitting. ' "Ainshuns,

treated some distance in the rear of. the oliff, c61-
cealing themselves in a thick'climp }f'underbrush,
which completely hid them, from the sight ofi'the
Indiais; bit from which the'top of the cliff became
distinctly visible, by slightly moving to one side
of the thick foliage.-
It was but a few moments till our heroes discoV-'
ered the two Indians, a man and a woman,. ascei-
ding the rock on which they had just been seated.
As soon as they had gained the submit, the old
Indian, (for such they discovered him to he,) be-
came somewhat agitated, and pointing his finge
to his feet,, exclaimed, in a tone suffiiently loud to
be heard by our hunters, "white man here !-"---
Then casting his eyes around in every direction
he seemed to scrutinize every object, gazing in the .
direction of 'our hunters much more intensely than
in any other. For a moment Philip imagined that
he was discovered. After'the old man had 'satis-
fled himself that no human eyes, apyarentlywere
upon him, he seated himself by the side of the
woman, and, in a low tone of voice, entered into a
long conversation, relating some story or legend,
connected, as our heroes supposed with the history
of this romantic cliff. The 'young woman, (for such
they discovered her to be,)listened very atten-
tively and apparently, at times, seemed much af-
fected, now and then wiping the tears from' her
eyes.
As the old man 'concluded his story,, he bowed
himself upon the rock (the young woman imitating
his movements) 'and remained ,in a kneeling pos-
ture 'for some moments.' Presently 'a 'cloud of'
smoke ascended from the- alter, and the orisons
were over. Descending the rockthe two Indians
again set forward on their journey.
As soon as they were out of' sight and 'hearing,
Philip and Ruffner returned to the rook. Philip's
curiosity was excited' to know by what means the

discharge his rifle unless attacked.
Proceeding on the trail of the Indians for some
distance without coming in sight of them, they
halted on the banks of a small stream,* which at
that time was very low. Here all signs of the trail
ended, and the hunters had almost concluded that
the old man had discovered them, and had taken
the greater caution to leave no signs of the trail
behind him. But Philip, who had wandered a short
distance down the banks of the creek, observed a
broken twig on the. opposite side.  Coming to a
halt,}he sat down awaiting the approach of Rhffner,
who, shortly after made his~ appearance on the op-

could with the :ins of,. the animals they had

: The tempest was now upon them; and such a
tempest! Heaven and earth "seemed clashing 'to-

from the flaming batteries of heaven.
"Py Shupiter," exclaimed the Dutchman "dish

of the wild war of the elements-the wind driven
rains,hail riven air, flickerig, burning and brighte-
ing, with the astounding thunder crashes and noise
of falling trees, mingled in horrible confusion, echo-
ing with deep repeatings and muffled reverberations,
from hill to hill, suggested to the romantic young
hunter the idea that ten thousand devil drummers
were summoning, with dismal roll, millionn of 'fire
spirits to the world's conflagration.
Such was a night tempest on the bans' of the
Clearfork in 1812,* as witnessed and.;endured. by
those two lonely pioneers.
Philip sat gazing with emotions of' mingled awe
and reverence upon this "elemental war."  He had
never before been'called to witness such a mag-
nificent -and terrific atmospheric' phenomenon, yet
notwithstanding the danger to which he was- ex-
posed, no   considerations would   have  induc-
ed him to have foregone this magnificent 'exhibition
of nature. He had often viewed nature in her mo-
ments f calm repose, had drank dee    from  the
fountains of the hills, and imbibed t pe seijit of the
sequestered"forest, and now" he' had,"for the first
time, seen nature in one ofl'her wildest poxfs3$is.
The winds had now sunk to agetle .gale" the
fury of the storm had passed over their 'heads, and
the silvery stars were begining to shine out upon
the high arch of heaven. Our hunters' arose from
their seats in their humble shelter''which together
with the skins of the animals, had p served themr
against the rfury  the rai and hail,'and advancing
towads the'margin of the bluff, gazed in'mdte as-
tnishment into the fearful abyss below, which
through the'darkness of'the night appeared the
more horrible.
"ot for noish' is dat?' exclaimed Ruffner, as his
ears caught the sound of a continuous. roaring in a
outherly direction from theel.,'  "'
*  his  d is  fresh in the memories of the earlyettlers'who are stilL.
living. in many places over which 'it passed its effects are yet visible.'

"It is the noise of falling water," replied Philip,
who had also caught the sound as Ruffner spoke.
1itis a cascade in all probability,  repeated he,
and I propose that we direct.our course thither."
"Und, vot you mean py ter gascat?" interrogated
the. Dutchman.
" Why," replied Philip, "a, little cataract, over
which the water'is precipitated."
"Vell, veil, poot I dosh not shtan under vot you
mean 'py ter catrack mit vauter precepty," said
the Dutchman. "Can't you shbeak blain vot I
knows mit out your pig vords ? "
"Yes, yes," replied Philip, much tickled at. the
Dutchman's language. "A cascade or' cataract is
, a water-fall, or a place where the water rolls over
rocks and falls to the ground."
"Veil, den," replied Ruffner, "ve vill go und see
dish, vot you calls him ?"
"ascadeanswered Philip.
.  Yaw, dish gascate.
Accordingly the two hunters directed their steps
in the direction ofthe qnticip4ted waterfall. They
had descended the clif and entered,;the valley,
leading in a southerly direction. The nearer they
approached, the more audible ,became the sound.
A deep and gloomy ravine lay before them, which
they entered, following it up .for some distance,
The.roaring of the water, echoing in the ravine
i' the darkness of night, was quite deafening.
Alarge quantity of rain had fallen, and this was
now.pouringin tor ents over the   broken rocks.
After our heroes had proceeded some distande.up
the ravine towards the 'falls, dtheydiscovere  t

ro pers. Dat ish 'burty tark,- tevelish  looking
".f sispicious looking locality," replied Thilip,
" lut I am anxious to learn its character, and I
think we can succeed much better now-than if we,
wait till morning.  As to this place being inhab-
ited by robbers I have no fearsof that. But there
may be a body of Indians encamping here. If so
they will not attack us now. LpV us proceed cau-
tiously til, we discover the nature of this light.
The adventure may be dangerously but the ad-
vantage is on our side, we will be under cover of
darkness, and if we discover the company to be too
numerous, we-. can retreat unnoticed. If they are
Tnadins, it is evident they do not anticipate the
approach of an enemy to night, as they have their
fires burning."
"Vell," replied Ruffner,u I ish ageet to any
ting tot you ish," so saying the Dutchman reprim-
ed his rifle, making all things secure in case of any
emergency.
Our heroes now approached; under cover of un-
derbrush, theplace from which the light proceed-
ed. The -noise of the failing water gave'then .an
opportunity of advaning without being heard.
The nearer they ap}p:oaohed the falls, the more.
parent thelight appeared. After coming within
several yards of the falls, they discovered the
light to proceed ffrm  behind them, which' made
the, jrecipitatig'flood appear more  rand and
picturesque. As they halted 'hoe frder  few mo-

Indian glided behind a rock and was lost to'sight,
At first Philip thought that the Indian 'had heard
the voice of Ruffner, but then again hb knew that
the roar of the falls would not, permit the sound of
ten such voices to become audible from the distance
where he stood, and as to their being discovered,
where they were, under cover of such deep dark-
ness, it was out of the question. Under these con-
siderations, his fears were dismissed, and they still
continued to advance towards the. light, until they
came within ten steps of the'rock upon which they
had seen the Indian. Here they paused, and a
consultation was held, in which it *as.'agreed that
one of them should advance upon the rock referred
to, and with the utmost caution examine the place
and discover if possible the position of the Indian.
This adventure was so ie ' bold, and perilous,
and was undertaken byh iip, while Ruffner was
to cover his retreat in  of an attack.
Philip gained the sockiunobserved, and unmo-
lested, when to his no small astonishment, he dis-
covered the objects of: hidday's pursuit. There
behind the cascade in a,   acious cavern,* which
. ran some distance under the. rock; sat the old In-
dian and Wha 'Philip now supposed his daughter.
Returning to uffner he communicated his discov-
ery to him; when it was"'agreed upon that both
should enter the cavern at the same time, with
the butts of their rifles foremost, so as to create as
little alarm as possible among the Indians. Ac-
cordingly they proceeded   boldly, to the rock,
when a piercing scream from the young maiden
aroused the old man who sat smoking his pipe
with his face turned in an opposite direction, and
springing to his feet, confronted the two hunters
with uplifted tomahawk.
*This romanti ldoality has since been denominated "Mempilock Falls," and
is often visited by the young people.  "Pio nio parties," often meet here, and
on some Qoeaaions, political meetings are said to have been held here. These

" I am the Indians friend," exclaimed Philip, ad,
vancing towards the old man with extended hand.
This was enough.      The old man     dropped his
hatchet, grasped his hand, and bidthim a hearty
welcome. A similar reception awaited the Dutch-
marg.

-descriptions of the fairy lands, where spirits and
elves assemble to hold their nightly festivals in
the still moonlight, which falling upon, and through
the checkered curtain of green, gives, enchantment
to 'the view. Such is but a faint description of this
natural curiosity, as it appeared to Philip at the,
period of this adventure.
As our hunters entered this cavern a bright bla-
zing fire, the light of which falling with an en-
chanting softness on every object around them,
gave the place an aspect of thg most fascinating
and dreamy beauty. Overhanging, this arching
entrance, and creeping out of the crevices of the
rock. above, came down .a thick curtain of wild
vines, interlaced and commingled with luxuriant
honey suckles with their bright colored blossoms,
fringing the front, of the cave on either side of
the falls.
But the' most beautiful sight which met theVision
of.the young man, was the young Indian maiden.
Her eyes: .met hisEas he :entered the cavern,
revealing to him as he imagined, a hidden world of
brightness and sunshine.
"Old       said Philip, after the party had  ur-
rounded the fire.   '1 hope we have not given you

"None whatever," replied he in broken English,

To this Philip readily consented, well', knowing
the place to which he alluded; and after partaking
of some venison and corn bread, the whole party
set out for the cliffs, where they arrived about the

In a few moments our hunters with the two. In-

they had sat the proceeding day. The old man
then commenced his story, relating every particu-

UR Tribe," commenced the
old man, , many years ago,
inhabited the Valley of the Schuyl-
kil, away towards the rising sun.
It was a lovely region. The bright
waters of this beautiful stream
rolled between banks studded with
the most charming flowers. Here
our forefathers -lived for many
years, undisturbed and unmolested,.
until the white man came among
them.   Then arose quarrels, and
many.were murdered on both sides.
At length our fathers were overpowered, and for-
ced to leave their hunting grounds, their wigwams,
and the graves of their fathers. They then emigra-
ted to the Valley of the Susquehanna, and from
thence across the Alleghenies to Ohio, settling
down in the Valley of the Muskingum. I was but'
a small boy at. the time.  Soon after we came to
this region, Christian Missionaries came among us.
They'established three stations on the Tuscarawas
River,   The names of these stations or villages

$ iri.The efforts of the Missionaries were paving
the way for the civilization' of our race. .While at
this station my father and mother both died""in the
Christian faith. Shortly afterthis sad4eveit a war
broke out between the American white people and
the nglish. When my parents iedI swad about
18'years of age, 'and with' a-sister younger' than
myself were the only members of the family living.
Immediately after the death of our parents, my sis-
ter' and myself, in company with 'several others,
left Gnadenhutten for the village of Wappat~mioa,*
on the Muskingum. Here we'lived for some tine,
passing the time away in hunting' :and fishing.

some time' in the afternoon.
Great was the rejoicing of the family on their
entering the Cabin, as during their absence they
had felt no little uneasiness concerning them.
Kate particularly, had had an unpleasant. dream, in
which she had seen them writhing in the agonies
of death under the tomahawk, and scalping knife.
As soon as the hunters. had arrived, Kate com-
menced the preparation of 'an.eening meal, which
was completed in a short time; and when they had
satisfied the demands of theiriappetites, Philip re-
lated the particulars of their; hunting adventure.
He gave Kate a full description ofithe old Indian
and his daughter, representing the latter as the
pergsnification of beauty and lo ee

CHAPTER XV.
CAPT, PIPE--BURNING OF CRAWFORD---LILY PIPE.
"Now ampic mead ; and fields of waving grain,
In golden color shine,.where-once
The Chieftain's a'e6in stood."  [Anonymous.
As Capt. Pipe has been introduced in a preced-
ing chapter, it is necessary here to break the chain
of our storrin order toagi re th leader some ad-
ditionl 'rtieul rsd his
Cato Fpe  w    - ", resident of Rhian4gCounty.
He had 'ot be= #iful daughter, hoWas the on-
ly eon:; :4    of  is cabin. 4s aeady remarked,
he w      i }   ouh a ui  wn  ,, having distin-
guishd       l f as such i severalufous battles.
The Caneeup to the year 1812,
was one mile  Ogfgi o n roeville, near the trail
leading to 1,ansfild  A  t  time   was a Chief
of a tribe of Defawares,"whose village stood near.
the present village of Jeromeville in Ashland
County.
The personal appearance of this distinguished
Chieftain, has already been given, as well as a
brief history of his early life, as revealed to our
hunters, by himself, which has never before been
published.,
It may not be uninteresting to state in connec-
tion with the above that this Chieftain, in company
with a British officer named Elliott, and an Indian
Uhief %amed Pimpcan, visited the Tus awes Ix,

r

dians in the fall previous to their murder by CoL
Williamson, and induced them to leave their ;villa-
ges, and throw themselves under the protection of
the British Government. Some of them     how
ever returning in thy. early part of the follow,
ing spring to gather in their corn, were surprised
and cruelly butchered by that inhuman monster
This bloody affair enraged the already highly ex-
asperated Chieftain, and he vowed vengeance. In
a few months afterwards an opportunity offered it-
self.  An expedition under the command of Col.
Crawford, wgas fitted out to destroy the Moravian
Villages along the Sandusky.  The object, of the
expedition was one of. extermination. No quarter
was to be given ; but a general massacre of men,
women and children were the'standing orders of
the army. The expedition was unsuccessful. The
Indians were aroused tothe highest pitch of in-
dignation, and they flocked around their Chiefs in
vast numbers. Capt. Pipe and another Chief named
Wingenund were the-two leading:spirits in this
enterprise. Col .Crawford was taken prisoner, and
suffered a most 'horrible death at the stake. Craw-
ford's trail to the Sandusky led through Richland
County. Theyspot were Col. Crawford suffered;
according to Col. John Johnson, was a fw miles
from Upper Sandusky, .on the old 'trail leading to
the fig :Spriag, Wyandot-Town.   It was on the
right bank of the" trail, going west, on a bottom  on
the east bank of the Tymoctee Creek. The noto-
riotis.Simon Girty was present during .the burning
of Col. Crawford, and witnessed hishorrible suffers-
ings with a savage delight. It is statedhowever,
that Girty offered to purchase the prisoner from
the Idians for three hundred and fifty dollars.-
But Pipe considered th proposition a high insult,
and replied, with a scowl of indignation on his
countenance, "Sir, do you think I ain a squaw?

The daughter of Capt. Pipe, as she was suppos-

ten solicited in marriage by young Indian .war-
riors, but refused every offer.  .A young Chief
of  noble birth. and   commanding talents rhad

PIIP IN LOVE.
"She is more delicate in form and face,
'  More beautiful thani maids of Indian race,
Her winning' smiles, with fascinating power,
Lit ub her Natures ip the joyous hour."
T wards the close of the day in which Ruffner and
Johnny Appleseed had left the cabin of Mr. Sey-'
ndour, Philip' and his sister , strolled away a shot
distance from  the cabin, and fseated, themseles
on a 'beautiful green bank near the water's 'edge.'
The evening was mild. and pleasant; and the shade
cool and refreshing.
"Kate," said Philip after they had been seated
"you are m' oily sister' and I feelihat without
your company, this wild forest would.,indeed, be a
desolate place; abut II must'own that dear as you are
'to m  'th-ere i'anotherno less interesting."

"may she not possess some Indian blood at least."
"Nay, nay, " replied Philip, somewhat confused,,
"I cannot bring my mind to believe that there is
one drop in her veins.. There is something within
my bosom which prompts me to say she is- purely
Anglo Saxon. .She is so'unlike all that constitutes
a savage nature, that it , is impossible for her to
be of Indian origin.  One glance at her love
speaking eyes, would be sufficient to convince you
that the girl is no';8avage, at least."
"Well," replied Kate, "you have aroused within
me a spirit ofcuriosity, 'and 'a strong desire to see
this mysterious being."
"Your desire shall be granted, and your curios-
ity satisfied, ' replied Philip; "and then,d ear sister,
you will say with. me, that, thereis a fguntau of
-love and  unshine in her pure heart, where the.
spirit of kindness ever plays upon its' depths-a
hidden treasure, which kings   ught covet axn
w ich the rude hand of death itself cannot destroy."

Rare ornaments and beads of various dye."
The cabin of Captain Pipe, like most Indjaneab-
ins, stood in a location .beautifully wild;i d Xo-
iantic. Everything around it gave evidence of i
proprietor's being: in; a considerable degree under
the influence of civilization. A few agricultural imn-
plemets; and domestic animals, showed that the
Captain wais re;ly a farmer; and the apgp eanpe

surrounded her head, while her jet black hair fell
in glossy ringlets around her shoulders. Another,
set with brilliants, surrounded her neck. Her feet
were encased in richly colored moccasins, iigh-

of beads. Pendant from her ears were two mas-

Surrounded her angers.

told:him  coneernin  the murder. But all to ano
purpose. The old geitleinans persisted, in staying
in his cabin-
Ox this occasion Johnny Appleseed distinguished
himself-as a."swift messenger," travelling day and
night, bare-headed and bare-footed, warning the
inhabitants of the approaching danger. He visited
every cabin within his route, from the Black Fork
to Mts Vernon, exclaiming, "the Spirit of the Lord
is upon me, and. he hath . anointed me to blow
the trumpet in the ,wilderness, and sound an alarm
in the forest, for behold the tribes of the heathen
are round about your doors, and a devouring flame
foiloweth after them.))
It- was ascertained however in a few days after-
wards, that the alaarwas unfounded, and that the
British and the Indians had enough of work to do
in i$heregion of the Lakes, for this surrender was
immediately followed kby'a series of splendid naval
vietorie.
Bi th    hearing news that followed the siarm
did    ' =relax the energy of the settlers in con-
structing hbuses-f safety. 1hey occupied a dan-
gerous ositicgKheingin the wilderness, and irxthe

vocationfbr  the. =hites would be surp. to arouse
their ege    ;thci  onti1u  d    aeiteffortta til
a sufficient-,umbr of such houses'were ereeted.
Immediately after the surrender of Hull,' the
Jeromeville Indians, left the country forCtleveland,
where they threw themselves under the protection
of the United States Governinent.
Wewould here reraarkthat at this period there
was a permanent :garrison stationed hee ' iider
Majoressup of"the U S. Army. It was the depot
of suphies adfiendezvous 'for troops.IHere' Cap-
'Thia fact waa received' from Mr. Joniathan Ohlfiedy to whomn Johnny made
his appearance on the occasion.

and notice the events rhich took place on the

all is over. The finger of Providenc  has touched
you heavily."
Here Philip gave vent to a floo4'f tears, which
moved to sympathy the hearts of all present.
Again the youngmangke;he had found relief
in tears and he bec nte iore calm and resigned:

and disappointment had: risen before him. Here
hesa, alone, while on other occasions the company
of Rate, had .made that place a home, But: alas'!
she would never more sit in this 'sacred spot.
During Philip's stay in this cool retreat the sol-

to bury'the dead.

I do not think it prudent to remain Here all night.

a cruel fate."

not suspicion our being here, and by retiring some
distance in the thicket, we can elude their obsenr
ovation, as they will leave the cabin at the first

heroes were awakened by the noise and bustle of
the Indians in the cabin, preparing' to start 'on
their work of destruction.

a horrible yell broke in upon the -,morning air, as.
the savages left the cabin to pursue their journey

"Let them   come !" .cried Philip, "they shall'

Onward came the two stalwart savages, little
dreaming that they were rushing into the jawa of
death. Nearer and still :nearer came the unsus-
pecting Indian.. OCrak.! crack!. went two rifles
at ,the sameinstant; and the two savages fell to
rise no more. Philip and his companion rushed to
the, spot where the fallen savages lay, but not un-

was jst breathing his last, while the other made
several unsuccessful attempts to gain his feet..,

Our heroes were now. doubly armed, as they
seized the rifles of the fallen Indians, and tarried
them along. C ontinuing their journey they came
to a singular spring of transparent water whieh
formed a most'interesting natural pheIomenon. It
was now mid day, and the sun was pouring its flood
of light upon the surface of the water, which being

Philip, who, during the old Chief's pitiful lamen-
tation, had sat a silent hearer, sprang to -his feet
as the old man 'ceased speaking-his eyes were
suffused with tears, but wiping them away, and
commanding his feelings, he burst forth into a tor-

"There once was," commenced the chieftin, "an,
e ceedingly beautiful young Indian maiden  hoc

man was a brave and fearless hunter bt,4he nmT

and she would set there larienting from, sunrm  to

no purpose. War and hunting had lost their charms
anl he threw aside his, war-club, bow and mrrows.
He had often, heard the old people talking . 1f :a

an.d peasant breezes were no longer felt. Being
scnt   clad, he beganto suffer with cold. Un
der h1ifeetwere pilex of snow, and above his head-
were s-en rolling turbulently across the heavens,
the murkystorm clouds. Weary' and fatigued he
lay dowhn to rest, after seeking a shelter from the
stories. During his slumber he d'ramed., In a
momentrh e was 'iii sight of the land of' spirits,
where hi  eyes] rested upon the object'of his search.
Soon-she Was 'by his side. "Come," said she, '"I
will shoesyou the red m, man's happy hunting
ground." "The"young man followed her until they
arrived at the margin of a clear running stream,
abounding with all rnvinner of the most beatitiful
fish.  "This," said she, "is the river of life.
Whoever drinks of this element can never die.
But east your eyes 'to the other side " said 'she,
pointing her finger in .that direction. " That is
the red mani's. everlasting home." The young man
cast his eyes in the direction pointed out, and' be-
held "*hat head'never before -seen. A lovely
aud  ein     unbounded -,forest lay 'before him,
through which roamed countless hordes of deer
buffalo anddother wild animals. Thousands and
tens of thousands of the gayest plumed birds of all'
kinds were ' nestling among the branches of the
treesfiling the forest with the most delightful
music. The forest was clothed in a mantle ofu n-
fading green, while an endless vanety of the most
beatifulnd fragrant flowers 'were interspersed
over theewde "expnse,preienting a loveliness be-
yond the powgrof description.
"fHow I longto wander in that delightful land."
said th&amp;iyoung man.
A,"replied the- maiden, "that wish cannot
nowe gratified. 'None but the Sos of merand
women neuter there. You cannot take your
bodyoyour bow and arrows there. You must
14k h saie rad~ you Oaine here, and' dwhR

the 'Master of life calls you, follow him, and hewill
conduct you safely through, and give-.you another
body, which will live forever."
The young man awoke, and found himself' in this
cavern. here he resolved to spend the remainder
of his life, which was very short . .n a few ears
he died-the Master of Life called .him hoyna to
join the company of the young maiden, in te spir-
it land."
Philip and his companion listened with' much
interest to the old man's legend, -and after pausing
a moment, Philip replied
"Venerable sir," your' tradition contains some
features, peculiar applicable to the condition of
my mind -at this time. Like that young warrior, I
shall start in search of your missing daughter, and
should I fail in finding her in some earthly wigwam,
I hope to- 'find her nestled among the unfading
beauties of the spirit land."
"May the blessings of the 'Great Spirit rest, up-
on your adventure," said the Captain, with much
feeling.
"And now .young men continuedhe, I conjure
you to reveal this location to none'but thoee in
whom you can repose the greatest confidence. This

whieh followed, white emigrats commenced planting their cabins there, and
at the period' bf which we write, there were about sixty cabins belonging to the
whites.
The surrender of tiull gave a fine opportunity for the Indians, to commit dep-
r~dtios. ccordingly, immediately after' this surrender, a' party' of Bitish
and Indians made their appearance at the Rapids, and,'wantonly plundered he
settlers of all the property they came across, and then returned to Detroi in
their canoes. There' were, however, three of this party who remained with, the
intention of plundering the few scattered families in the wilderness. One of
these was a young Delaware Chief, named Sac-a~manc. This was !the same
notorious Chief whose name was a terror to many a pooh pioneer family. Like
a stealthy tiger, he sought his prey in smbuscade. The dame ofSac-a-mane
was well known among tse-pioneere1 on .OA4 ireek, KIn x county; where he
distinguished himself in the scalping business. The cntion  o t  dean,
therefore, at this Period, was indeed perilous. The country was desolated, and
everywhere were seen scouting parties of Indians,

Of pleasure in thei forest wild ;

William Buntly, or Bunty 'Billy as he:was gen-
erally called by the early settlers on the .Black
Fork,'has been introduced in a preceedingchapter.
But since the murder of the Seymour family noth-
ing had been heard of ,him. His disappearance
from' the Black Fork was a matterpf cojecLge
among the people. Philip had visited .ffner's
cabin after- th e .burial of his. parents,. and'found
it dreary and desolate... He had made.gqiry
encerning. Billy, but no one had seen ;hip . It
was, therefore supposed that he hade either been
murderedior taken prisoner.    '
Philip was no little astonished in  eetinzg him
aens inthe wilderness, so fa,,rom the hlnts of
civilization.  He was also constrained 'tod-t -
it:is vision. But, contrary to his expectations,

murdered the Seymour fuaily, the detail of which
have already been given.
After the Indians had committed the murder
they determined to dispatch Billy also. With this
intention they proceeded immediately to the cabin
of Ruffner, hoping to find him there, but had not
proceeded more than a mile when they met him
in the woods with his rifle, on his way ,to the Sey-
mour cabin., The Indians had recognized him first,
and secreting themselves'waited the boy's approach.
Coming up td them they sprang out of their
hiding place and ordered him to halt. The sudden
appearance of the savages alarmed him, and hasti-
ly raising his rifle -to a level, fired upon thre one
nearest him, but the ball" whistled harmlessly by
the savage, who rushing upon him was about to
smite him to' the ' earth. with. his tomahawk, when
the strongg arm of another savage behind 'him,
eauights  rm and held it fast at the same 'time
brotestng against the murder of the boy.

feelings of older persons, but Billy's heart though
but a boy's, was Indian proof, and fearless of the
consequences he spake as he felt.
As the morning ,sun was roiling his chariot of
light up the eastern sky, Billy' and his captors
found themselves on the banks of 'the Clear Fork.
Thay had halted, xear where the thriving little
irlag aof Beliville inow  stands; for the pur-
pose of resting and refreshing themselves., From
thence they proceeded to the banks of the Vernon
river, or, as it is often called, "Owl Creek." 'Here
Billy was transferred into the hands ofan old Chief
who with some' of his tribe, were on their way' to
the seat of war on the 1Maumee. The next morn-
ing after their arrival on the waters of Owl Creek,
Billy arid his new master took up their line of iharch.
The old Chief was much pleased with'the boy,
and gave special instructions to treat him kindly.
Billy recognized his kindness and sought ever
opportunity to gratify his new master.
Towards evening they came to the bank of the
Olentangy or Whetstone River, where they struck
their tents, and encamped for tt  g  N-ext
morning they again took up their  a eand con-
tinued their journey until they arrived at the banks
of the Sandusky, now in CrawfordC ounty    and
following the ba nks of thisstream, finally came to
the mouth of the river.

coming acquainted with their manners and customs.
He was a prisoner, yets. he had all the privileges
9fhissQegnpanions. .In:their sporting exercise he
made himself their superiors, which, on. several on-
casions, he fered would prove dangerous to 'his
'ife. but Billy was determined, come life or death,
to, become master of the sport.' Risheroism was
always approved by his master, who would often
pat him on the head, anad call him in broker}Eng-
lish: "Fine boy-brate boy-good boy &amp;c."
Bily remained ;in tis region for several days,
during which time he affected entire contentment.
Oneday the Indians held 'a council, in which it was'
proposed to form avscouting party, for thepurpose
of pInler. Accordingly the time was appointed
o which to..set out on their .,expedition. Billy,
though contrary to-his solicitations, was left be-
hind with the women and children and old mien.-
It was on this occasion that he meditated his es-
cape. The Indians 'left the village early one
morning, and Billy ,the night following. The
Scouting;party 'left for the Huron river, and Billy
for Fortindlyof which he had heard the direc-
tion, and had' been 'assured that it stood upon
Blanchard's'fork of the Auglaize.,
.e evening Billy started upon his lonely and
perilfrsjourney, was dark and rainy. The wilder"f
ness was shrouded in gloom. Wild beasts and wild
men surro'und4ed him; but thesewere no barrier in
hitwayd He had been raised injthe 'woods, aiidt
the yells and" owls of savages and wild' bets-
His trusty rifle was upon his shoulder, his salping
kife hung ahis side and.in 'his 'bosom he barredd
a heart ii gnagious- -above fear and eowadi+e-
Billy followed up 'the bank of the river till day-
light, when, after securing a shelterthe determin-
ed e remain n  t till dark, fearing the Idiaans
F  ' t  'bJ  p r uit  of-.
During this night he was attacked by a gang 'of

wolves, but, he managed to keep them at bay. In
the' bourse of an hour or two after Ihe had' started
fromhis shelter his  eyes caught the, glimpse oft a
light some distance ahead of him in the Woods.
Moving cautiously towards it he discovered'it to
be the caip fire of a small band of Indians" Ex
amining the camp carefully he preceived that; the
party consisted of three savages, either of Whom
'he could have laid dead in his seat,'-bat fighting
them Was out of the~ question." Watching them
for some moments he discovered' that they were
in great glee, 'making merry over their super,
after which they lay down to rest. Billy kept
quiet for some time after the savages elay 'down,
until he imagined they where asleep; when he
again commenced his journey. After traveling
as far up the river as he deemed necessary, he cros-
sed the, stream and proceeded westward hoping
to strike the banks of Blanchard's Fork, and then
the Fort. Continuing his course till morning, he
again sought shelter, and 'laid by till evening, when
he again continued his course, as he supposed to-
wards the Fort. But Billy had missed his course
and instead of making Fort Fiddly, his place of des-
tination, he arrived at the gorge or ravine *here
he met 'his friend Philip Seymour.
Billy's adventure since leaving "the Sandusky
was attended with no danger other than that aris-
ing from the attack of wolves. But with these he
was familiar, and knew well their disposition and
Smode of attack.  The report of- the- ifle which
Philip 'aid 'his companion had heard, wad produced
by Billy, who had dischaiged it at on' of these
creatures.  The' animal had followed him, but
Billy delayed his progress by giving hith the coin-
teite of his rifle.

retired to 4fhe shelter under the bank, who
entered into a conversation, in which each party
revealedto the other his adventures.:
Billy, said Philp after the former had given
Vhe latter a history of: his adventure, "I am  very
glad to see you once more. I have oftenwon-
dered what. had become of you since the murder, of
our friends= on the Black Fork. Ihad come to the
conaluion that the red devils had taken your scalp
too."'
"Thee here, Mr. Themour, thee here," said Bil-
ly holding out his rifle, "do you think thir, that
this shooting iron will 'perit any of theth  cur-.
thed rathkalth to inthult my dreaming thell in

act of .Indigncruelty. Many a brave and fearless
hunter,has fallen a;acrifice tosavage cruelty,nt-.
withstanding his means of defence."
 "tOth:their piAthurth," responded Billy, " they
can't thcalp me 'fore I give them one dothe of

"Some backbone in this fellow Alf," said Philip,
addressing himself to his companion: "Billy's the
real g4tand no mistake."
"There's none," replied Alfred, "that I have
seen. in.my travels, in whom cprbine such heroism
and sagacity, considering his age. I am  truly.
proud ,f his courage; and shall hope to have ,hhim
as our forest exmpanion, provided he woul be
plea.sed to join =oexpedition."
"That is just what will please him," said Philip.
"Whaty sayouBilly."

"I understand yer, thir," said Billy, "but muth

At the mention of the word snakes, Philip's grav-
ity was disturbed-he was, forced to give vent to
a fit of laughter, as his mind wandered back to the
battle of snakes on Clea Fork, and at the recol-
lections of his horrible dream on that eventful
night, he once more muttered a bitter curse on
the snake family, after which he related to Alfred
all the particulars concerning that adventure.
Alfred was much amused. on hearing Phiiip's ac-
count of this affair, and Billy would, every now
and then, as an opportunity presented itself, look
at Philip with one of his rougish smiles, and, ex-
claim: "Cuth the tuna/lct."
Several hours had thus passed away and the lit-
tle party had enjoyed themselves with the most
heartfelt happiness. Weary with conversation
they lay down to rest with their rifles under their
heads. Their sl ahnber was unbroken, and they did
not awake till morning twilight was visible.
As soon as our heroes had partaken of some re-
freshments, they left their shelter and once more
plunged into the forest and continued their course
in a'southernly direction until they came in sight
of an Indian village,* on the banks of a beautiful
streamt of water.  Near the village was a
orchard of fruit trees! of about ten or fifteen years
standing. These trees were  laden  with   fruit.
Upon inspection they found the principle inhabi-
tants to be old men, women and children.

*This village was called Wap-agh-ko-notta and was' the residence of the
Shawnees afte- they were driven from. Piqua, by Gen. Clark.

"Whst next," said Alfred, as they care, to a halt
a few hundred yards from the Villa ge,: "shall we'
enter this village and rely uppn the mercy of the
savages, or shall we retreat before we are discov-
ered."
"Thee; here Misther AIf," interrupted Billy,
"Thee here, ther'th no going back with thith thild,
untilI thee thum of the thquaw, if nothing elthe:
"Come, come Billy," said Philip, you mus'nt be'
go venturesome you'l get us into a bad fix by being.
too heroic. It won't do, you must be obedient or
we'll never live to see Tilly's face again. You'
know, Billy if you were to get into a snap, I am.
bound to help you out, therefore, you must  not
put our lives in danger by being so desperately
reckless."
"Hist," said Alfred, '"I hear the sound of foot-
steps among the brush, I'm  afraid we're caught
this time."
The young hunters, each sheltered himself be-
hind a tree and' held' himself in readiness foi
defence, but scarcely had they found shelter when
the voice of a lone eanine sentinel,broke the stillness
of'the night, with a good English accentuation of
Bow, wow, wow,."
"Thod blatht the dog," said Billy, and raising
his rife to his shoulder, was about to give the an-
ima a quietus, but Philip prevented him.
"Get ouV-go home you infernal whelp," said
Philip, 'as the animal' continued his howling. But
the dog had never been trained in Noah Webster's
school'of language, aid as the'Dutchman would' say
he could "nix fort1ag," and therefore he howled
'With more vehemence.
"What the deuce shall we do," asked Alfred, if
we retreat the dog will pursue us, 'and bring out
allthe warriors of the village on our track, and if
wd 'stay here we shall be. surrounded and taken

" Well our dilemma is none of the pleasantest,
and I am lost to know how to decide," said Philip.
" But it is my opinion-"
At this moment a combination of yells greeted
their ears. The savages had heard the barking,
which they knew to be an indication of danger.
Instantly, they hastened to the, place, where they
found our heroes. Upon discovery, Philip stepped
from behind a tree, and advancing toward an old
Chief, proffered him his han1, which the old man
readily accepted. Alfred and Billy came next,
each in 'turn shaking hands with the old man and
his warriors. The old Chief invited them to the
village, where they spent the evening and the
next day in the most agreeable manner. Some of
the inhabitants could speak the English language
quite fluently.
It was during their stay in this village that Phil-
ip formed the acquaintance of several friendly
Chiefs, one of whom will form the' subject of an
interesting chapter in this narrative.
After spending a day or two with these friendly
Indians, our young heroes again commenced their
adventure, shaping their course in the direct4pi
of the Muskingui. They had learned from  the
old .Chief that a-party of Indians had passed near
their village in that direction, and Philip and Al-
fred determined'to follow them, We shall leave
our; heroes in pursuit of the savages, awd give the
reader a short sketch of' history, relating to :the
village of Wa-pa-kon-et-ta as was made known by
the leading Chief, Black Hof.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF BLACK HOOF THE DISTINGUISFHED
SHA-WA-NOES CHIEF.
"And thus while seated on his couch of green,
T1'he, old man talked of manya scene
Of days gone by. Of many a legend old,
And magic tale."
Black Hoof, the old Indian Chief mentioned in
the last chapter, belonged to the Sha-wan-oes tribe.
He was a warrior of high rank and notoriety; and
was born in Florida, a few years after which, with
a portion of the tribe he removed' to Ohio and
Pennsylvania.   Black Hoof, with others of his
tribe, .were present at Braddock's defeat, near
Pittsburgh, in 1755. He was engaged in all the
wars from that time until the treaty of Greenville
in 1795. He was noted for his cunning, sagacity
and experience; and united with these, was his
fierce and desperate bravery. He was bold and
daring almost to recklessness. Being the invete-
rate' foe' to the white man, his vengence knew
scarcely any limits; and' under his tomahawk and
scalping knife, many a white man had met his eter-
nal fate. Black Hoof maintained that no peace
should be made, nor any negotiations entered into
with the whites, except on condition ;that the lat-
.ter should repass the mountains, and leave the M-
sissippi valley to the sole occupancy of the'fnaf'
tribes. These were his sentimnts, and he ewer

,

all the energies of his mind and body in carrying
then out.
Black Hoof was the orator of his tribe, and was
well versed in the traditions of his people. But
although he was a stern and uncompromising en-
emy of the whites, and although, 'through a long
series of forty years he had nerved his arm in a
hundred bloody battles, yet he became at length
convinced,,that the struggles of his race against
the encroachment of the whites were in vain. A
deep conviction of this truth rested upon his mind
and he communicated his apprehensions to his tribe.
The campaign of General Wayne completely over-
threw all hopes of their success, and he abandon-
ed the project forever. He signed the treaty of
peace at Greenville,and continued a faithful friend
to the whites ever afterward. He died at the ad-
vanced age of 110 years, a short .time previous
to the treaty of 1831.*
In the war of 1812, Tecumseh     and his brother,
the prophet, paid him a visit for the purpose of
enlisting him in their cause,but he per-emptorily
refused them; and although he did not personally
take an active part in the war, yet he exerted a
salutary, influence in favor of the Americans.
Such was Black Hoof, the distinguished Sha-wa-
noes Chief. Philip and his companions were high-
ly entertained and pleased with him; and although
an untutored:savage, they found,;him nevertheless
to be a most graceful and pleasing manet
They had conversed with him, vith freeness and
interest, and' he had revealed to them' a most thril-
ling account of his adventures for forty years past.
*This treaty was made with the senceas of Lewiston,-ald the,Sha-wa-noes
ofWai-ko etotsby' James Gaianer;ad Col. n'Ilvaia.  inriisioners
appoin ted by the, Government. The terms offered to these Indians wer'e lib-
eral, and theyconsentedto be removed beyond the Mississippi. aThen were
removed to te Indian Territory on Kansas river in 133. 'Por Black Hoof,
his remains are on our soil, while his tribA roam over the lands of the far West.

Black Hoof was the particular friend of Captain
Pipe, they had fought side by side against the
whites up to the treaty of 1795. He had learned
of the burningof Greentown, and the masacre of
the whites on the Black Fork, and expressed a deep
abhorance against the whole proceeding, but laid
the blame of the whole affair upon Col. Greer and
Kratzes.- He had been informed of hi. friend's
(Capt. Pipe) removal to Cleveland, but knew noth-
ing of the circumstance of his daughter's myste-
rious disappearance.
On being told of this affair, he seemed somewhat
perplexed, and deeply affected. He applauded
the galantr-y of Philip and his companions, and.
promised them the protection of his tribe while in
his dominions.
Before dismissing the history of Black Hoof, we
must notice one or two other traits in his character
which in Indian life seem quite remarkable., It is
well known that Indians practice Poligamy; and
are generally in favor of sacrificing the lives of
prisoners at the stake. These two enormities
Black Hoof condemned. He hved 40 years with.
one wife, and never put to death a single prisoner
by fire. ie was not- present at the burning of
Crawford, or perhaps that unfortunate man might
have been spared the pains of such a horrible
death.
With these' considerations concerning the life
and character of this remarkable man, we -are pre-
paz'ed to fully appreciate hissterling integrity.
Philip, and his companions left the old Chief
much entertained, delighted;and refreshed, with
the understanding that'they would return to the
village on their way back from the Muskingum.

PHILP AND IIIS (OMPNTONS RESUME 'TEIIR JOURNEY----MEETINO
WITH INDIANS IN- THE 'BLACK HAND NARROWS -'HEY
MEET A 'COMPANY OF SCOUTS.
The captive's hand hathlaid him low,
He knew not'that his foes were near,  *
In death he sleeps, and life's warm glow
Has fled his bleeding body there.
Philip and his companions, after leaving the
village of Wap-a-konet-ta, shaped their course to-
wards the head waters of the Sciota, and proceed-
ing down, its banks came to a white settlement, in
which they found a commodious. Block House,*
where they were hospitably entertained. They
communicated to the settlers the object of their
adventure in this region, and made enquiry as to
the condition of the country through which they
had to pass on' their way to Zanesville,
It was a cold and wintry morning when our he-
roes left the Block- House, and once .more plunged
into the wild woods. Winter:was now set.in-
dark clouds and dark days.--deep snows, chilling
winds and biting frosts were now to be encounter-
ed.. The prospectbefore them was, to use a mod-
ern' phrase, "a little mixed."  But the bold  .,d
fearless hearts of Philip 'and his-companions, cow-
ered not before the approach of cold or danger.
Their object Was one of humanity, andupon the
success of their adventure depended thehappness

of the fearless and generous hearted leader of that
little band. They were enured to hardships, pri-
vations and dangers. Each one was homeless and
friendless, and dependent upon his own exertions
for support and protection. Reader, place your-
self, by imagination, in their condition--in the
heart of a drery wilderness, exposed to the in-
clemency of the weather-rain sleet, snow and
cold; while wild beasts and savage foes roamed
the woods in all directions.
"Billy," said Philip, "['m afraid that camping out
these cold nights will be. hurtful to your health.,
I am almost sorry I did not prevail upon you to
remain in the block house till spring."
"Thirtainly Mr. Themour, you'rmithtaken in yer
man. Bifly Buntly'th not the thap to freethe
ath long ath ther'th a earth thkinin the woodth
with a thprinkling of wool on the outhide."
"True, true, Billy, I didnt think of that. "Bear's
wool is by no means scarce; and with such a, suit,
old 'Boreas' may come blustering and howling
among the' forest trees with breath as! cold as
icicles."
"And who the mithief ith old Mr.'Boreath ? never
hearn tell of thuch an individthual in all my born
dayth' athked Billy, somewhat at a loss to compre-
hend the meaning of the word "Boreas."
The apparent earnestness with which Billy ask-
ed the question, completed with the comic ex-
pression of his countenance, constrained Philip and"
his' companion to indulge in a hearty laugh.
Aware that Philip and Alfred were indulging a laugh
at his expense, Billy 'collected his wits and cooly
replied:.
"Yeth, yeth, now I underthand yer--thod blatht
yer-thith  Boreath,-they thay   ith death on

"Bravo Billy," cried Alfred, "your a trump, by'

taii, but our attack must he under cover of dark-
ness.".
Ourleroes thus lay secreted for some time con-
versing infr=low tone of voice, during which the
savages seemed to enjoy themselves inthe highest
degree. After finishing their meal they proceeded
ontheir journey, followed by our heroes until they
came to a romantic gorge, known to the early hun-
ters by rt  nameiof the "Black  ind Marrows.,
e te Idias made. their camp for the night.
Thesun had gone down behind a heavy bank of
dar  ouds, as our hunters arrived at these "Nar-
s  They.had traced the Indians into the de-
nt ering to enter until they had reconnoi-
tered, they did not pursue them.
,The Na rows were dark and gloomy, and the
wilderness around them cheerless and forbidding.
,,e yougmen were in the midst of dangers, but
these dangers had no terrors to disarm  them of
their courage.
"Alfred," said chili  "you and Billy remain
here, whle 'make a small circuit to the top of the
liffs. The reddevils are in this gorge, and will
knimke their camp in the most secure position. In
c.~sd4am attackedyou can cometomy distance.
nt u tildiscovered you must remain quiet."
I hi  then proceeded ioiselessly and aitious-
 to le:p of the cliff, and haltingon lthe very

verge, discovered a light beneath him, but- could
discover no signs of the savages themselves.
It was evident to Philip that the, camp fire vas
under his feet, and. reflected the, light on the op-
posite side. The side of the narrows on which
he stood seemed considerably more elevated than
the opposite side. Returning to his companions
he bade them follow him to the opposite bank,
where they discovered the three savages seated
under the shelving of the rocks immediately under
the cliff where Philiphadstood. A bright fire lighted
up the gloomy gorge, and the unsuspecting sava-
ges were making merry over their evening meal,
little dreaming that the eyes of their white foes
were upon them. Their camp was, as Philip .had
expected, in the most inaccessible part of ,the
gorge. They could not approach them at either
end of the narrows without detection, but from
their position on there lower, bank of the narrows,
they had an uninterrupted view of the savages.
"Now's our chance," said Philip. "Billy, single
out your man, and make your aim sure."
"Well, third " whisper'ed Billy, "I will thettle
my account with that devilish ugly looking thavage.
He juth lookth like the thame thap who took me
prithoner on the Black Fork, and I want to thoot
him becauth he juth lookth like him."
"A very good reason Billy,"-said Philip, 4he
shall be your man." Then turning to Alfred- he
said:
"Alf, you single out of that fellow on the left,
and I will take' the other. One, two, three' said
Philip in a whisper and' the report of three rifles
rang out upon the night air of that deep and
gloomy gorge, bringing almost instantaneous death
to three unsuspecting savages within.' But in a
few minutes after the sound of their rifles had died
away in the distant forest, the sound of advancing
footsteps were hear d sonme distaticedin heirherar.

A BRIEF KSKETCO OF THE MURDERED INDIANS-HEROIC
ALEXANDER( M CONNEL.

ACT OF

The party of Indians mentioned in our last chap-
ter, had been taken prisoners near New Philadl-
phia in Tuscarawas' County; and conveyed to Sen-
eca through 'Zanesville, which was, at this time, a
thrivingblittle village. 'Here the Indians ,were
lodged in prison over night; during 'Which time
some of the settlers paid them a visit. The In-
diansould, to some extent, understand and speak
he glish language.
At first when they were taken, they appeared
alen andrefused 10 enter into conversation; but
raduallythey became more cheerful and communi-
cative.  diIg assures that they would be treated
kindly, and that no one should harm them, they
gave a fall statement of their lives.
It appeas' from this statement that they belong-
ed to'he Delaware tribe, and that one of them
was oneof the five that attacked 'the Seymour cab-
in 'This one called himself John Buckskin,
and stated that after the whites had burned their
villageon the Black Fork, he vowed vengence on
every white man who came into his power; that
hbhad formedthe plot to murder the Seymour
familynd plunder them of their money;; that he
was also in thwbattle at the Copus cabin, where he

4

Was WQ nded in jthe arm with a bullet.,:e also
stated'that his own arm had slain the ', ack Fork
Dutchman,' (meaning.Ruffner,)whiom. he, rep reseu tr
ed as, one of the most powerful men he had eyer
con tended with. This with .some other facts, cozw
netted with the depredations on the Black Fork
settlement, already known to the. reader, weie
made known to the settlers of Zanesville, by this
Indian.
On being asked whether he did not think, he
did wrong in murdering   the  innocent, people
the'ife, he .replied in the negative. He further sta-
ted that under similar circumstances he, would do
so again,' He -then askedd for some tobacco:whichz
being given him, he divided it with his'companions,
and lighting their pipes they sat down, and engag-
ed in smoking and conversing in his own language.
The next morning after their imprisonniet in
Zanesville, a crowd of spectators gathered around
the window on the outside. One.of these asked
them if they, could :sing. They replied'in theaf-
firmative, pnd being requested, to do so, one of the

In sh 4'the qualities of both his heart and head
'were oa 'more than ordinary -excellence; for nature
had bestowed u4pon him lineaments of gradefulnes

dent in the lifer of B eav r'which should be known
and read by all coming generations-,as a memorial
of hisunimpeachable integrity and gotdsfeeling
towards his friends.
During the war of 1812, the friendly Indian ;
particularly 'the Delawa es, Sha-wa-noes andSe
cas,, were'"invited to join the American'cause; and
quite a number, belonging to. these tribes accepted
the offer; amongthis number was' Beaver, whogas
'we have said, was introdue d- to Captain Pipe at
Seneca. ' youngg Beaver's father and General iar-
'rison had been upon terms of unbrokeafriendship.
The father had been put to' death, like many oth-

daysabfore the Warriorsset out-for theSatof

ting along tihe waters'of the Wabash, and that le
wished tojoin the army about to start for Seneca.
Not doubting his honesty of-intention, his name
was eeioiled among the number of warriors. Up-
on their arkivalat MeArthur's Block House (which
was"'a fortif e-ation built in the late war on the Scio-
ta river, on Hull's .road, in HardinCounty)they
halted and' encamped. for the purpose o'f receiving
provisions from.the Deputy Indian Agent, Col."

Blue Jackethad made a doifident of  a young
warrior, who also was warmly attached' to Beaver.
This_ arrior vas of:the same tribe to which .Blue
Ja ket belonged. Calling hiur aside, he communi-
cated to his friend his intention to .murder General
Ikrrison'on his arrival at Fort Seneca,. and' re-
que ted him to assist him. His Afriend refused, and
endeavoredIto dissuade him from so base an .,act.
But Blue Jhteket declared'that he would assassin.te

be "Out'pto pieces not bigger than his thumb

time'in his life Beaver'was placed in a seem nly
inextricable dilemma'. For some time- he satin Ai-
lent meditation; -he conned the matter over and
over in his mind. While 'he thus'sat in hesitation,
,the notorious assassin came into the Deleware
camp. The eyes of Beaver fell upon him, as he
came, staggering with intoxication, and breathing
vengeance upon Col.\hMcPherson, who had just
turned him out of his house for disorderly conduct.
The sight of the traitor roused the indignation of
Beaver, and arising from his seat he advanced to-
wards him.. His keen black eye was full of fire-
his bosom heaved with wild emotions, and with,.a
.firm and unfaltering v ice 'he thus addressed him:
"You must be a great warrior-you will not on-

The Sha-wa-noes applauded the conduct of Bea-
ver, and rejoiced at their happy escape from the
ignominy into which the murder of the General
would have thrown them.
On their arrival at Seneca, the principle war
Chief of the Sha-wa-noes, requested permission to
sleep at the door of the General's Marquee, which
he did until 'the embarkation of -the troops. This
was done to prove his fidelity to the American ane.

of valuables was soon gathered up, and all the vil-
lagers were ready for the game.
The village was situated in a beautiful location
and the country around was truly delightful. They
were soon upon the lawn, and separated into tw~o
parties, one consisting of the women, and the men.
Our heroes were requested to perticipate in the
sport, but they politely declined, with the exceP'
tion. of Billy, who was anxious to engage in the
game, which was to be a game of 'foot ball."
The Indian boys were much rejoiced in, having
Billy for their companion in the game, and. Billy
was determined on distinguishing himself as a mas-
ter 1andat the:sport.
At thismga e the men were to play against the-
women,and the'rules by which they were to be
governed;were as follows: The men were not to
touch the bal withstheirshands, on pen alty of loos-
ing the game; but the women were allowed to pick
it up, run withit, and throw it as far as they could;
but in so doing the men were permitted to catch
the-women shakethem, and, even throw them
downh order'to extricate the ball 'from them;
but  tI to touch it only with their feet.
At t     oost et remityof'the play ground,
Staes were driven in the earth, and when the ball
wa  beyond either of these stakes the
game wa   oed     hen all were ready the Chief
too h    position between the two parties, and
throwing the ball into the air, retired and the con-
test  eo nni d  Billy plunged into the midst
th de agity of a cat; although somewhat
*u  M ,rhe was remarkably nimble-
The'Indians were'evidently much pleased with
h i ole 'rty,  d sought every opportunity to ex-

tumbling of the contending parties. -Thecontest
lasted for more than an hour, which swed that
the parties were well matched. At one period of
the game, the ball was caught bya young .Indian
squaw; Billy was close behind her side; she at-
tempted to run, he followed and immediately she
was in his arms. A scuffle ensuedwhich lasted for
a few moments. The young squaw. vas hiseqital
in strength, and Billy found his-match. At length
she succeeded in prostrating her antagonist. T1ie
women sent up a shout of triumph. Quick as
lightning Billy was again up 9n his feet, and, bing
.chagrined at -hearing his female antagonistso
highly applauded, and knowing that Philp aud
Alfred would.never cease tormentinghirm over his
defeat, he again commenced the strugglesummon-
ing all his strength, he made one deperateefQrt,
and the young squaw lay sprawling upon gtl e grpund.
Her fall was somewhat hrd, nd a, relied   the
ground she dropped .the ball, whereupon1' iBilly
gave it a kick with his foot, sending it some;dis-
tance in advance of him. In amomentit  as in
the hands of a herculean' squaw,rho on recti4g
it commenced running towards the.stake followed
by Billy and his antagonist with several o  s.
Billy succeeded in ovrtL ing Eer and .a.  g
a hold of her garment,h eld on.being 4iaggpd  e
distance by her with the force of a locomotive.
Billy finding that -she was nearing the stake,
caught her by the ankle, and she   fell just as
a party of males and females advanced upon them.
In falling she dropped the ball, and the next instant
a kick from Billy's foot sent it whirling with the
rapidity of a bullet past the stake.
The victory was won, and the infant backwoods-
man, Bunty-Billy was the victor. A shout of ex-
ultation rent the air, and old and young crowded
around the young man. Every one was anxious to
take him by the hand. The eyes of the Indians

were rivitea upon him; ashe stood there, the en-
viga hero of the game.. The young squaw with
whom he had the severest struggle, had slyly crept
by hiside, and extending her handsome Indian
countenance, thus addressed him:
"You brave boy-make good warrior-great
Chief--fine man for good squaw--much happy have
you stay here."
"Thood Jike to do. tho, Mitheth Inthun," said
Billy, "but pon my thoul, I cant thith time. I
muth help my friend Mr. Themour to hunt hith
thquaw."
As soon as the game had closed, the Chief who
bad held the prize, commanded the parties to be
seated, after which he presented the prize to Billy
who tipon receiving it, bowed as. gracefully as he
'knew how, at the same time thanking the Chief
for the valuables.
"Ith thith mine?" said Billy.'.
"Yei sir." said the Chief emphatically.
"el then," said Billy, "I can dithpothe of it
ath I pleathe:"
The Chief answered in the affirmative. Where-.
upon Billy apportioned the prize to the "Ladieth,"
(giving tlie young squaw.the entire half, and an equal
4ka re to 4he rest. The disposition was highly ap-
piaud dby the men, who on beholding Billy's gen-
rsity seitup an other shout of acclamation.

DREAM--BEAVER INTRODUCED TO PHILIP.
"With heart felt grief, the Chiefiain
Satwithin his cave. No tidings cane
Of her, for whom he wept, and sighed."
The morning after the game of football, mention-
ed in our-last chapter, our trio-of young backswood-
men left the village and continued their journey
towards the cave of Captain Pipe, where they arri-
ved in safety in a few days.
The old Chief was the sole occupant of the Cav-
ern, when our heroes entered,'and was reclining
upon some skins of wild animals, absorbed in deep
meditation.
"Good evening Captain Pipe," exclaimed each of
the two young men, who advancing towards himin
turn, renewed their friendship by a hearty shake
of the hand.
"And who is that you . bring along with you ?"
asked the Captain.
"This sir," said Philip, "is an orphan boy named
William Buntly, but whom we call "Buaty .glly."

to you himself.
"Ah, indeed," replied the Captain, "and is this'
"Bunty Billy," of whom you spoke to me on a pre.
vious occasion?"
"Yes sir," said Philip, "and a more manly heart
never beat in a man's bosom than his: He bears
himself so much above his years. Fear or coward-
ice form no yart of his composition. But we. will
talk over this matter again. Any 'news concern-
ing Lilly?"
'2Vne, nove,' replied the old man pensively, nor
need L, I presume, ask you for any?"
Philip sighed heavily, repeating the Chieftain's
answer: "None, none." Then pausing, while tears
started in his eyes, a deep and solemn silence, for
a few moments reigied in that subterranean recess.
" gone, none," repeated the young man, after a
fe ,,nment's pause. Then turning to Alfred, who
.s  yPAhisig with the afflictedChieftain and his
sorrwfoulstricken companion, he said:
'.Alfred I am, indeed, melancholy. As Igaze
uponthegloomy walls of this cavern, thoughts of

"Philip," interrupted his companion: "lieisin

on the bank of the river.-The party had proceed-
ed as far as Middle'Bass Island, but found -they
could proceed no further, in consequence of the
breaking up of the ice. They, therefore abandon-
ed the enterprise, and returned to Fort Meigs:
During their retreat, three young men deserted
them,. retraced their"steps towards Maiden, and
while encamped in the woods a few miles, from this
post, they were. surprised by a party of Indians and
taken as prisoners -to Malden. It is' needless to
say that these prisoners were none others than
Philip Seymour; Alfred Bradley and Bunty-Billy.*
Fort Maiden, the place to which our heroes were
taken, was situated on the east bank of P etroit
River, on the Canada side, and was oMiginally
under the command o    General Brock, to whom
Gen. Hull surrendered his army. Shortly after-
wards Brook was killed at the seige of Queenstown,
after which the command fell into. the hands of
Col. Proctor, who at this time held possession of
Fort Maiden.
On their arrival here, our young heroes found
themselves in: the midst .of Indians and their, no
less .savage foes, the British. They were immedia-
tely -phaed under guard with quite a-number of
other'prisoners.
We must not forget to mention ;that the inten-
tions of the party to which our heroes joined thern-
selves, was anticipated by two supposed Freich-
men wholeft Sandusky (the day before the coin-
pany hd started on this pbrilou expedition) and
crossed 'the ice to Malden, and gave Proctor the
alarm. The British General immediately sent out
his India scouts to watch their 'movements, and
coning upon our heroes, as they lay in camp under
the outh of Huron River, took them prisoners'
The next morning after their capture Gol.

-Proctor paid them a visit in person, and interroga-
ted them  as to their business in this region.
Philip told them  they were hunters, and their
business was that of hunting-that they were from
the Black Fork in Ohio, and that-they had missed
their way, being in an uninhabited wilderness.
Proctor' had them searched in hope of finding some
papers about them which might prove them to be
spies. But in this, he failed, and he gave orders
to keep. them under guard until he ordered other-
wise. He then left for the purpose of holding a
conference with Tecumseh. The next morning
Proctor, accompanied by Tecumseh, paid them
another visit.
On his first appearance Philip and Alfred were
deeply impressed with the person of Tecumseh--
it was the first time they had seen him. There
was something about his whole person which wad
truly commanding. Philip gazd upon this noble
looking Chief with feelings bordering upon awe ;
and no wonder, for Tecumseh was the most extra-
ordinary Chief that ever appeared in history.. He
was by birth a Shawanoes, and under other circum-
stances would had been .an honor to the.world.
He was, epadowed by nature with the attributes of
mind necessary for great political combinations.. It
was he who formed the grand scheme of uniting all
he, tribes east of the Mississippiinto hostility
against the U:. States.. This. enterprise' he com-
nieneed as early as 1809, andup till the ,war, he
had insiguanted himself by his adroitness, eloquence
and courage, into every tribe from Michilinackin-
nok to Georgia. By his eloquence and cunning-
ness, he played upon the feelings and superstitions
of his race ; and carried with him 'a red stick, which
he, represented as possessing mgical properties,
the acqeptaneg f. whichwas. considered .as joining
his party. From this circumstance the name. "Red
BSlicks" was .appliedtt.all Indians, hodtile to the
United States.

Tecumseh on approaching our heroescast upon
them a; deep and searching glance. His fiery eye
serit a thrill of horror into the hearts of all but
Billy, who sat unmoved by this powerful chief.
Col. Proctor made strict interrogations of Philip
concerning the forces and intentions of General
Harrison. Philip told him that as to his intentions
he knew nothing ; as he. supposed that none but
his .staff officers knew:them; but as to his forces
they were daily increasing-as he passed near the
mouth of the Maumee river a~few days ago; he ac-
eidently came upon his forces, at a vacated camp
fire, on the north 'bank of the river, where he
(Harrison) was joined by a large body of troops-
that after being examined by' Harrison's officers he
was permitted to proceed on his hunting expedi-
tion
This statement Proctor knew was true,.and he
gave orders to treat the prisoners kindly. He
offered them the hospitalities of his fort, but com-
manded that a vigilant watch be kept upon them.
The party was then conducted to the quarters of
Tecumseh. Here Philip and his companions held
a council, in which it was agreed that they would
remain on the peninsula till the breaking up of
winter, and then effect their escape.
Philip sought every opportunity to enquire after
Lilly, without giving any cause of. suspicion. His
anxious eyes closely scrutinized every group of
women ; which caused many enquiring glances to
be cast upon him by those dark eyed forest daugh,
ters.
Time rolled on;- and' nothing was heard of the
young maiden. It is not necessary to tax the
readers patience 'with a recital of the feelings and
anxieties of Philip, during that gloomy winter, at
Fort Malden. The reader's imagination must sup-
ply the place of description.

April, Philip and his companions were seated upon
the banks of the river in sight of the Fort. The
severity of the weather had moderated, and balmy
spring'was hastening on.

Then pausing, Philip gazed for a moment into
the face of his companions, while a profusion of
tears rolled down his cheeks.
The scene was deeply affecting, and Billy and
Alfred mingled their tears with his.
At the appointed hour Philip was inside the

ence of his beautiful Black Fork Lilly!

CHAPTER XXXIII.
INTERVIEW WITH LILLY PIPE-PLANS FOR ESCAPE.
'Twas such a night as might have flung,
It's robe o'er primal nature's bower
On that blest night, the hunter found
His long lost love, the forest flower.
The joy and happiness produced in the minds of
Philip and 'Lilly, at their meeting in the garrison
at Maiden, we ,hall not attempt to 'describe. Lan-
guage is too meagre to express the emotions, which
naturally arise in the minds:of kindred spirits, on
meeting,' under such circumstances.
.As Philp entered the apartment, the beautiful
Lilly met his astonished gaze.
There she sat alone--beautiful as when he had
first seen her 'under Hemlook Fall, in Richland
county.
"Dearest Lilly," exclaimed the aatonished and
somewhat bewildered Philip, as he ,oened the
door of her hub le'apatien--" dearest Lilly"
repeated he,,7and springing to her, clasped her in
his armhs; wile tears of joy rn' down 'his manly
cheeks-   ',1
The happiness which the younghunter this mo-
ment experienced we shall lea e the' reader to im-
agine. For a moment neither of the ,lovers could'
speak: but . that silence was ,big with feeliug-a
feeling, too,.which was inexpressiblydeep. Months

of painful anxiety had tortured their minds, they
both had drank deeply from afflictions bitter cup:
but for all their past woes, the present interview
was an ample attonement, and forgetting. the past,
they rejoiced over the present. As soon as the
young man could command his feelings he thus ad-
dressed 'his "fair one."
"Dearest Lilly, "I am indeed happy- too happy;
I havenot deserved of Heaven so great, a joy as
this. The highest -hope, which ever pictured the
future earth to me, never toldme of bliss like this.
Lily; didst thou ever pray for me? 'I have' for
thee  and I' have felt that my prayers, which I
have tremblingly whispered in the ear. of Heaven,
would be wafted to thy ears by some; bright angelic
minister, the guardian spirit of thy footsteps on
earth. Often times, dark gloomy shadows came
across my mind ; but then I was consoled to know
that the eye which never sleeps would witch and
protect thy pure and innocent spirit, though. lost
to human sight in the untraversed worlds through-
out the depths of unmeasuranble space. Nay, more
I haye felt 'that should I not have found that here
on earth, my oWn soul would have caught a spark
of God's own essence, whose' whole being is love,
which would have lighted me on, follwing, thy
flight through the cycles of eternity ; thi would
have lit up the dark wilderness o f worlds and i-
luminated the voids of space,
"iWhere gravitation wenia to turn the other way.
'Yea, dearest Lillyy thi&amp;would have lent bright-
ness to the'eyes of my soul, so that Iiwould have
recognized thy 'angel face i   a land of darkest
shadows, though around thy form hovered the in-
habitantis'of'cogegated worlds, multitudenous'as

was a depth of unmeasuired holy feeling in his ex-
pression. Her pure and' virtuous heart breathed
the same devoted feeling, and she replied
"Phf'lip Seymour-fyour kindness toone so un-
Worthy I would desire to appreciate, and next to
your name I would pronounce that of my' father-
what tidings of him?"
"All is 'well- captain Pipe is well. Give your-
self'no uiieasiness concerning him," said Philip.
i'hen my 'happiness is complete," replied the
lovely"indian maiden. "I shall see him agaih and
drinlk' once more from the fountainh of his affeo-
tions.- Devoted father- hewill: lay his hands upon

"And'here permit me to say that, to you I owe
a debt: of gratitude; which I would delight to can-
cel were it i miy powerr.'
"Thouowest me nothing exclaimed the young
hunter  AlI have done forthee, was prompted
by other than selfish motives. Lilly'I itust confess
t-I love thee dost 'thou love me ?'"
"Pihli " exclaimed the young maiden, gazing
modestly into his,,fa'e; "you are my deliverer, and
waiting y ur pleasure you shall be mny future pro-
tector."'
'PThank yu, thank you, dearest Lilly--I thank
you for such words of consolation; -and here, in the

man ; "such language wounds    ey beings '.
Then I would crave your pardon," said 'the
maiden.
"Nay, ny," replied Phitp,"thou hast no pardon

"But I am an orphan." replied the maiden ";I

CHAPTER XXXIIII.
ESCAPE FROM MALDEN-BATTLE WITH INDIANS.

In the course of an hour, Philip and his com-
panions were seated on the. banks of the' river.
The night was dark, &amp;nd the heavens were pouring
down their watery treasures. Here they remained
'nearly an hour before Lilly made her appearance.
At last their eyes fell upon 'the outline 'of a human
form, moving towards them through the darkness
of the night. That forn' was Lilly's. She had
passed the guards in safety, attired in male cos-
tume. Noiselessly the little party entered one of
the boats, and under the darkness of the night,
with Bpuch- difficulty and no little danger, they
moored Their vessel on the.opposite side of the
rivers Stepping' on -shore,. 'they commenced their
journey through 'what is now called Monroe Co.,
Michigan, bordering on the Lake - shore. ' The
weather being 'wet and considerable rain having
fallen, their -march was anything but: agreeable.
Besides they were; in the heart of an enemy's
country, and exposed to the incursions of their
savage foes. Towardsmorning they encamped in
a dense thicket, almost surrdunded by a swamp.

One dark and windy .night, in the month 'of
April, 1813. one 'Capt. Wm. Oliver in 'company
with-a young Kentuckian, left Fort Meigs for, Ft.
Findly, a distance of about thirty-three miles. ' It
was about nine o'clock when they started on their
journey, which at this period, was cenuidered ex-
trenely perilous,-They had not' proceeded: far
when they came suddenly in sight of an Indian
camp, around the fires of which the savages were
busy preparing their suppers. They had approach-
ed within disturbing distance of' the savages, ho,
on hearing the noise of their horses hoofs, sprang
to their feet and with savage yells atackedthen.
On hearing their yells,.they reined;their ?horses
into the branches of a fallen tree. 'The: horses, as
if conscious of the danger,,stood perfectly'still.
The Indians supposing them 'to have retreated
towards the Fort pursued, them, passing around
the tree without making any discovery of them in

the thick darkness. As soon as the Indians had
gone some distance, they put spurs to their horses
and dashed forward through the woods through
which they passed all the way to their destination,
where they arrived safely with the exceptionof.
their, clothes, which were torn into rags by, bushes
and brambles. In this rapid flight they received
quite a number of contusions against the trees,
leaving several marks upon their bodies. They
had scarcely made secure their flight into the Fort
when the Indians also made their appearance ; but
they were too late for their prey, and consequently
commenced a retreat.
The next day a party of soldiers accompanied
the Captain and his companion' back to Fort Meigs,
when theCaptain made known to the officers .his
night journey through the wilderness.
"The. damn 'red sticks," exclaimeda tall, young.
Indian Chief, "me hunt 'em up-me give 'em what
white man call "'ticklar h--l."  And so saying, he
called around him his, young and fiery warriors,

the brow of one of the banks of the, ravine,they
lay down fatupon the ground, awaiting therresait
of their observation.
. As the Indians lay in this position, Beaver and
his party, who had been, closelypursuing them, ad-
vaned upon them, arranging his men in the most
favorable position, commanded them to make sure
of. heir prey.
At thesignal of their commander, the deep
silence of that'wilderness was broken by. the sharp
reports of the death-dealing rifles, ringing thiiough
that dark forest ; and the mingled yelled of nearly
three score of savages rose above the din of battle.
The prostrate Indians were perfectly panig strick-
en ; and those who survived the onset sprang to
their feet and bounding down the bank of the ra-
vine, endeavored to make their escape as best they
could throughthe deep darkness of the night.
Beaver and his warriors pursued them down the
ravine for some distance; but loosing sight of them
after they had followed them several miles, return-
ed to the place where. theyhad attacked then.
On theirreturn Philip recognized the noble hearted

sleep ; accordingly, thqv lay down upon their blank-
ets, under cover of a tent, before a blazing fire and
slept soundly till inorning.
As the light of day broke in upon the forest, the
Indians were astir, and after plundering the dead
of their arms and clothing, they started for the cave
of Captain 'Pipe, in company with Philip and his
companions.
Before leaving the camp, Philip informed Beaver
of the conversation which Alfred had held- with a
dying  Indian, after the battle.   Whereupon
Beaver had his body brought into the camp for
burial.
Lily and Philip on beholding him were. no little
astonished to find him to be no other than the re-
pulsive and bloody Kanotchy, the murderer of Kate
Seymour.
"Great God !" exclaimed Lilly, "this is the same
Indian who tore me away from my devoted father-
this is the merciless and unfeeling Kanotchy. My
prayer is answered-the curse of' Heaven has fallen
upon him, and he has met his fate in a moment
last 'expected. Poor fellow !" said she, "after all
I cannot help pitying him."
"Pity the devil !" said. Billy, "ith a pity he had'nt
thucked'himthelf to death thortly' after he came to
life on the 'thage of action."
For a fewmoments Philip and Lilly stood gazing
upon the lifeless remains of this bloody savage,
while thoughts of other days rose fresh in their
memories. Before them lay the murderer of Kate,
and the abducted of Lilly, but the arm which had
struck the fatal blow was now paralyzed by the
ha d of death.
Philip on first beholding the wretch, had his
feelings wrought up to a high pitch 'of excitement,
and could scarcely refrain from hewing his body to

pieces; but a sober reflection taught him that such
an act would not satisfy the demands of vengeance.
After hastily despositing him with his dead eom-
panions, the party left the camp and proceeded to
the cave of Captain Pipe, where they. arrived a
little after night fall. Beaver and his warriors
had accompanied them within a few miles of their
destination, and then retraced their steps to Harri-
son's Head Quarters.

CAPT. PIPE MEETING S WITH HIS DAUGHTE--EXPECTED ATTACK
OF THE BRITISH.
"Kind Heaven, whose power no being can control
Hath sent her back to cheer the Chieftain's soul."
The pleasure and happiness which Capt. Pipe
experienced at the meeting of his daughter cannot
be pictured.
We admire the sentiment expressed by the poetic
Dryden, in one of his celebrated odes, when. he
says
"Sweet is pleasure after pain."
This sentiment .the reader has, no doubt, often
experienced. In most instances, the, pleasure we
receive, after undergoing days, months or years of
painful anxieties, is heightened with the contrast
of 'the past. We look back on the past, and re-
member .its struggles--the difficulties, privations
and sorrows with which we had to contend ; and
contrasting them with our emancipation from them
all, we seem to realize an extent of pleasurable
sensations beyond our most sanguine expectations.
Earth with its grand and magnificent scenery was
educed from chaos end darkness; and 'gold which
exhibits the most dazzling lustre, is first tortured

During .this affecting colloquy, Philip and his
companions had remained silent; but their feelings
were in harmony with the old man and his affee-
tion ate daughter. The interview was of the most
affe acting nature: and the young men, though silent,
we p't like children.
Th e Captain then turned to the young hunters,
and thus addressed them:
"Gentlemen, to you I am indebted for the heart-
felt happiness I this moment experience. You
have brought to my soul a world of joy in returning
to me this dear creature. It is not in my power to
reward you pecuniarily for this great service which
you have tendered me. Gold and' silver possess
no merits to requite this act of kindness.  The
wealth of the world is but a 'poor remuneration;
and' I cannot estimate this act of humanity, only by
the standard of eternal happiness, which I pray
the Great Spirit to confer upon you all. You have
encountered and triumphed over the thousand dif-
ficulties and perils which beset 'the lives of pio-
neers-others would have grown weary and dis-
couraged, and abandoned the enterprise as hope-
less and reckless. But in you, I find all the ele-
ments necessary for carrying out any undertaking,
however seemingly impracticable. And here permit
me tosay to you, that this act of kindness shall be
remunerated."
"Captain," exclaimed Philip, I thank you most
affectionately for the distingiished consideration
with which jyou so generously regard myompan-
ions and myselff. You speak of remuneration, Sir,
I aux alre aly 'remunerated  LIhave been fully
comperis ted for all the difficulties and. rangers
through, wideh I have passed in performing. this
duly. The gratification arising from the knoWl-
edge of one's having rendered his fellow 'man a
service when he nmst s tas in need' of it, is a bet-
ter remuneration than all the riches of the world,

With you sir, I too can rejoice, and with you too,
I can weep."
"Venerable sir," said Alfred, "I am happy to ex-
press my thanks to you for your favorable opinion
of myself'. This distinguished consideration isdully
appreciated; and here. permit me toatsure.:you
that in addition to what little I have alreadgedone
to secure the'happiness of you and your daughter,
I am willing to go upon any errand of mercy or
humanity you may bepleased to.send ie."
"Thee here, Mr. Alf, by the mother of Motheth,
and that haintha thaying anything bad about.the
gall-th,-I'll go with you--even tho far ath to the-
thouth gate of the bottomleth pit, on thuch an er-
rand."
During the conversation Lilly had been seated
by the-side of her father, now and then wiping
the tears from her eyes,,as she listened to expres-
sionsrof the high ;r ga rd :for her happiness mani-
fested by her deliverers.
Philip's mind as he lay down to rest, dwelt upon
the young maiden; and strange thoughts were pass-
ing 'through the mind; of Alfre4Bradky, whose

father; and for your valuable services. he will
richly reward you, by driving the white rebels off
your land restoring them to you. It is now our.
intention to storm Fort Meigs, the Head Quarters
of General Harrison, and in this undertaking your
services are indispensably necessary. Youchave
about one thousand warriors under your camihand,
which you will please place in such positions, as are
best adapted to their mode of fighting; and bid
to remember that the standing orders of the seige
are 'no quarters to the d -n rebels.'
"Sir," replied the noble Chief, "I lift up my'
hatchet only to save the lives of my people and
protect my country ; and under this consideration
I am ready to follow you to battle."
"well said Proctor, "it is for you alone that
the-King has sent his'subjects here. They come to
help you regain your lands from these plundering
white rebels,"
In the course of ten or twelve days after this
conversation one afternoon as the forces of Gen.
lJarrison were gathered together on parade before
the: camp,: 'Bunty, Billy came running up to one' of
the officers, exclaiming:
"Thee. here, Mither officer," pointing his, finger
towards two strangers on the opposite side of the
river, "thee there's two thuthpithious looking fel-
lowth thanding on the other aside of the river, ean't
you give em as thuitable invitation to pay you a
nearer vithet.".
"Certainly my little, man,". said the officer ; ,and
turning this  n, bade them clear the battery,
and lt'rthwith the engine was pointed towards thern,
and the next moment the earth was seen flying
about them in all directions.
By the beard of ,Mahomet," exclaimed .the
icer, "that was an admirable shot. See !.the
devils are off like a hurricane-straight for an-
~ada."

Happy it would have been for many a*.gallant
hero, had that missile brought death to those two
Chieftains, who were none others than Proctor, and
Tecumseh:
Some time after dark of the same night, three
young Cnen entered Fort Meigs  ith :te startling
intelligence that a large body of British and
Indians had landed their forces on the hill on the
north side of the river, and were busily engaged in
erecting their batteries preparatory to an attack
the next morning.
Morning came, revealing to. the General, the
army of Proctor and Tecumseh on a commanding
eminence on the opposite of the river ;the main
part being stationed at the old English Fort, some
distance below.
On one bank of that turbid stream were.stationed
the haughty legions. of Proctor, and his bloody
allies, the merciless Indians; on the other was.the
gallant Harrison and his hardy pioneers.
'Twas morning-a lovely May morning.. The
golden sun was wheeling up his chariot..cf light
above the tinted horizon. The mingled melodies
of the woodland minstrels were floating upon ;the
soft and balmy morning air, filling the forest with
the most enchanting strain; little dreaming of. the
horrible storm  of war then gathering ,in deadly
g1o6m over that garden vale of the Maumee.
Hark 'tis the trump of war-=-the cannon's mighty
roar. The siege has now commenced : and can-
non answers to -threcaboming cannon's roar, wbjle
the firm, solid earth seems to tremble under the
mighty shock, for three successive days.
"See! General," exlam ed one of .the. offers,
"the Indians have crossed the river and are as-
eendig 'the tops of the trees upon. the brow of
yonder.hill."
At this moment a message was received frpm
Proctor, requesting th&amp; surrender of the Frt.

'from its socket to the no small astonishment, and
infinite delight of his companions. On examination
the shell was found to be filled with inflammable
matter, which once ignited would have wrapped
the whole building in one sheet of luri4 flame.
This circumstance, it is said, lent wings to their
shovels, and with the loss of some of their compan-
ions the work was soon completed.
On the night of the 4th of May, about 12 o'clock,
a messenger arrived at Fort Meigs, bringing the
welcome intelligence of the near arrival of General
Clay,'with his brave Kentuckians-that he was
within two hour's march of' the Fort.-Harrison
had been daily expecting him, and on receiving
this intelligence sent orders for him to land eight
hundred of his men on the right bank, take, posses-
sion of and spike their cannon, and then immedia-
tely return to their boats and cross the river and
seek protection in the Fort.. The remainder of his
forces were to land on the left bank and fight their way
to the Fort, while sorties were to be made from the
garrison in aid of this operation. Col. Dudley being
eldest in command, led the van. He effected the
landing of his men without difficulty, and executed
the orders of his General, after which he called
upon his men to fly to the boats ; but they dis-
obeyed his orders, and sent up a shout of triumph;
and permitted themselves to be drawn in ambush
by the Indians.
General Harrison and some of his officers were
standing upon the grand battery, and, seeing the
danger into which the infatuated soldiers of Col.
Dudley were plunging themselves, beckoned them
to return ; but the soldiers supposing them  to be
returning the cheers, they reiterated their shouts
of triumph.-Harrison seeing 'their reckless infatua,
tion, cried out in tones of deepest anguish-

lars to any man who will cross that river and in-
form Col. Dudley of his danger."
This was attempted, but before the gallant young
men had reached the middle of the river, the Brif
ish and Indians had cut off their retreat, and now
the work cf death had commenced. They now saw
their hopeless condition. The red hounds of hell
came pouring round the terror stricken soldiers
in overwhelming numbers, while their shouts and
yells rent the forest with the most appalling din.
The battle now commence ir  -earnest, and hand
to hand and face to face they fought and fell. The
Americans were defeated and surrendered themselves
prisoners of war. As their arms were taken from
them, the mingled yells of that wood full of savages
rose high above the cannon's roar, echoing through
that wilderness, like the dismal shout of ten thous-.
and devils in the gloomy caverns of perdition.
They were lost !
The prisoners were given up to the tender mer-
cies of the savages who after contlucting them  to
the old garrison, commenced the work of butchery,
under the eyes, of the loathsome and detestable
Procter.' The work of death had commenced, and
the red current of life was soon flowing from the
bodies of the mangled wretches.
While this was going on, a raging thundering
voice was heard in a distance, and the next mo-
ment a bold and graceful chief reined his fiery steed
in their midst, and dismounted near 'where two of
his brethren were in the act of murdering a prison-
er. He seized one by the throat, and the other by
the breast, and with one powerful effort threw them
to the ground. Then drawing his tomahawk and
scalping knife, he ran between the prisoners and
the Indians with the fury of a madman-. and dared
any of the hundreds which surrounded him to at-
tempt to murder 'another white prisoner. Then
turning round he exclaimed :
"Where is Gen'I Proctor ?"

Proctor, who was standing at a short distance off
conversing with an Indian Chief, exclaimed in a
cowardly tone ;
"Here I am."
'Then sir," replied the distinguished Chief,.
" why don't you stop this inhuman butchery ?"
"/Sir," replied this cowardly human brute, "your
Indians cannot be controlled,"
* Begone then from my sight," retorted the noble
hearted savage ; "You are not fit to command-go
and put on petticoats."
This cutting reproof stung Proctor to the heart,
he bit his lips with rage, but had not the manhood
to reply, and returning to his savage companion
renewed the conversation ;
"Captain Montour," said Proctor, "I shall look
for you at your post at the- appointed time. The
Indian bowed his assent, and the next moment put-
ting spurs to his horse, he dashed off rapidly to-
wards Fort Maiden.

CAPTAIN MONTOUR SURPRISED AT LILLY)S ESCAPE--ANOTHER
ATTACK ON FORT MEIGS..
He sought in vain the maiden fair-
His prize had gone-he knew not whore.
Captain Montour, mentioned in the last chapter,
was originally from Black Fork in Richland county..
He belonged to the Delawares at Greentown. This
Indian was highly intellectual, and had graduated
at Cannonsburgh college. He was a sharp, shrewd
villian. On being made acquainted with' the his-
tory of his race, he found that they had been great.
ly imposed upon by the whites. This knowledge
embittered.him  against the whites, and he only
waited an opportunity to direct his influence against
them. The opportunity was offered in the last war
with England. Some time during the year of 1811,
Tecumseh paid him a visit at Greentown, and with
the promise of being promoted to office he secured
his services. Montour sought an interview with
Captain Pipe, in hopes of securing his influence on
the side of Tecumseh ; but the Captain treated his
proposal with contempt, alleging as his reason for
so doing the consideration of the fact that helhad

signed the treaty at Greenville in 1795, at which
time he had pledged his honor that he would,for-
ever afterwards maintain his integrity.
This enraged the haughty Chief, and he vowed
vengeance. Hitherto Montour had been on term's
of friendship with Captain Pipe, and had endeavor-
ed to insinuate himself into the favor and esteem
of his daughter Onishishsha.
Mont our was a handsome and 'intelligent Indiat,
and' Lilly had sbown him some respect, (but enter-
tained no sentiments of love for him,) but on his
attempt to dissuade the mind of her parent from in-
tegrity, she became highly incensed against him,
end abruptly left his company. Shortly afterwards
Montour left Black Fork,, and threw himself under
the protection of the British government in Canada,
where he received the commission of captain.
As soon as the war broke out, this perfidious vil-
lian sought every opportunity to wreak his venge-
ance on Captain Pipe, who had as he conceived,
offered him a base insult. To attempt to take the
life of the Captain he knew would not do, as it
would call down upon him the vengeance of many
who, though opposed to the American cause, Were
nevertheless his firm friends,
He had sought the hand of Lilly, but she had
indignantly refused him; and he determined to
wrest her from her father. by force. .For this pur-
pose he engaged the service of the bloody Kanot-
chy, and some others. Kapotchy was instructed to
watch the movements of Captain Pipe, and com-
municate the same to Montour. Accordingly, as
soon as Kanotchy learned that Captain Pipe had
determined, to remove to Cleveland, he sent Mon-
tour the, intelligence, requesting him to meet him
on the bank of the Lake near Cleveland.
Kanotchy and his accomplices followed the Capt.
,and, his daughter to Cleveland, and on'tly following
evening found Lilly alone as she was seated upon

the bank of the Lake, and approaching her, seized
her in his arms and bore her off to Montour, who
having all things in readiness, hastened away with
her to Malden, where she was found by Philip and
his companions. Kanotchy with his companions im-
mediately returned to Black Fork'in order to elude
suspicion, where we have found him engaged after-
wards in the outrages committed in that region.
On arrival .at Fort Malden, after the first siege
of Fort Meigs, Montour was no little surprised on
finding that his intended victim had escaped. She
was missing. Th made strict inquiry as to her dis-
appearance, but could gain no information respect-
ing her elopement, and he almost came to the con-
clusion that some invisible agent had aided her in
escaping, as she had repeatedly told him that un-
seen guardians were daily attending her footsteps,
and that the Great Spirit to whom  she had com-
mitted her entire being would some day visit him
and all the others concerned in her abduction with
condign punishment.
Montour spent the greater part of the day in
searching for information respecting Lilly, but all
to no purpose. At length he thought of the three
prisoners, who a few weeks previous had been
taken, into the garrison, and on enquiry, he found
that they too, were among the missing. He further
ascertained that two female Indians had passed by
these prisoners, as they were seated on the shore
of the stream, but could not ascertain their names.
Taking these things into, consideration, the dis-
appointed and outwitted Chief rightly inferred
that they had been sent in search of the girl, and
had carried their scheme into successful operation.
Montour finding that he had been outwitted by-
the whites became more deeply exasperated, and
swearing vengeance upon every white man, he
again crossed the river, and at the appointed time
called uiyow Gen'l Proctor, and informed him of what

248

J

l
'

249

had transpired in the Fort since they had left, and
sgnified his willingness to hazard his life in any
enterprise which promised th'e destruction of every.
American rebel.
"Well," said Proctor, "I have concluded to re
new the siege of Fort Meigs.. Calm and deliberate
consideration has induced me to believe that a sec-
ond attempt will be successful. But on calling a
council of war it was agreed not to commence the
attack again until they had collected a sufficient
force to take the Fort by storm. But before re-
treating to Malden, Proctor made another demand
on General Harrison to surrender. But Harrison
admonished the cowardly butcherer not to repeat
it, upon which Proctor withdrew his forces to
Maiden, and after remaining there a.few days e-
turned; and on the 22d day of May made another
attack, but met with no better success than before,
and again retreated in confusion, covered with dis-
grace, to his Head Quarters, where he meditated
an attack upon Fort Stephenson, on the Sandusky.
"In a few days after the second seige .of 'Fort
Meigs, Philip and his companions 'paid another
visit to the cave of Captain Pipe, for, the purpose
of persuading him to leave the cavern and 'take
refuge in Fort Meigs. But the Captain declined,
and gave as his reason the uncertainty of war, and
in case of surrender or'capture, his daughter would
meet with no mercy from the hands of her savage
foes. He felt entire safety where he was,' as the
cavern was unknown.
"But go," said he, ".fight for and .defend your
brethren, and should you fall in defending them,
your death will be the more gloriou.
"Oh father !", exclaimed his daughter with 'ears
in her eyes, "he must not die."
" My God, Mitheth Lilly," said Billy, ;" dont
think 'of the liketh; you couldn't kill lMatier

Philip, no how. If he wath to be thot, he wouldn't

"Pshaw Billy," replied Alfred, "you're jesting:
Philip's visits here are on business relating exclusi-
vely to the father."
"Mebby tho," said Billy;.."well, if thath the
cathe,,I do athure you, it muth be moth thunderen

At this juncture Alfred could no longer restrain
his " risibilities," and giving vent to his f ellings in-
dulgecd in a paroxysm of hearty laughter.
Come, come Billy," said Philip, "none of your
nonsense ; your getting overly romantic since you
made your last will and testament to your fair
victress on the arena at the village of Wapakon-
neta."
As soon as Philip had finished his reply to Billy,
he proceeded to give the old man and his daughter
an account of the siege and affairs at Fort Meigs,
and after remaining a day or, two with the Chief-
tan, he and his companions again set out for the
Fort;'for' the purpose of securing position in the
army in which they might be the most servicable
to their country.
Some few days previous to the attack upon
Fort Stephenson, Philip and his companions set
out on a reconnoitering expedition with the in-
tention of visiting Major Croghan at Fort Stepen-
son.  The young men directed their steps to-
wards the Lake shore, about twenty' miles from
the Fort. But owing, to the numerous swamps
and the darkness of the night they missed their
way, and wandering in the woods, suddenly c;ame
upon a party of Indians seated around their camp-
ire, apparently in the greatest glee, making mer-

G&amp;EN. HARRISON INVADING CANADA-DEATH OF TEOUMSEH.
While clouds of sulphur compass then around
The dead and dying strew the goryground,
The day is lost, some in confusion fly,
Some stand their ground and resolutely die.
September the tenth, 1813, is a day ever memo-
rable in the annals of American history. Two hos-
tile armies were stationed on the opposite shores of
the Lake, awaiting the result of the battle in dread-
fu'l suspense. The battle was fought midway be
tween those two armies, on Lake Erie, a few miles
distant from the Ottawa line, between Commodore
Perry, commander of the American fleet and. Com-
modore 3arclay of the British fleet. At fifteen
minutes past eleven o'clock the sound of the war
bugle was heard stealing over the waters of that
tranquil lake from the Detroit, the enemies head-
most ship, ad the next moment loud and deafning
cheers from 11 the crews rose in mid air, followed
by the more appalling cannon's roar. The battle
had commenced, and for three dreadful hours were
the waters of that beautiful lake shaken, by the
storm of battle. 'Tis over. The Americans are
victorious, and the thunders of the battle are hush-

ed in silence, save the dying moans of the mangled
warriors strewn upon the decks.
'T was four o'clock, when the gallant Perry, fold-
ing up a piece of paper placed it into the hands,of
a messenger, who leaving the scene of bloodshed,
sped his way to Gen. Harrison and placed in his
hands the message from Perry. Hastily tearing it
open the General read aloud, while a breathless
anxiety rested on the minds of his officers and
soldiers:
GENERAL HARR1SN-Sia: We have met the enemy
and they are ours.
0. H. PRaRY.
On, hearing this welcome intelligence, one long
and loud shout of "long live the gallant Perry,"
rose high above   the forest trees around Fort
Meigs.
This brilliant victory inspired the American
General with the most sanguine expectations of
the full completion of all the contempleted objects
of the expedition, and he accordingly-made, prepa-
rations to strike the decisive blow, by invading
Canada.
- Accordingly the most energetic preparations
were put in- operation, and on the morning of Sep-
tember the 27th, the whole army, artillry, ih-
tary stores, provisions, and troops Were ready for
embarkation. Before starting General Harrison
addressed his army.
"Fellow soldiers, said he, "there is a future in
the tide of war, when conducted in the=light ofiself

revenge of a soldier cannot be gratified on a fallen
enemy."         .      -
." Towards sundown of the same day, on the site
of Maiden, which they found in ruins, the army had
landed in high spirits; but the enemy had aband-
oned their strong hold, and retreated to Sandwich,
after dismantling Malden, burning the barracks and
navy yard, and stripping the adjacent country of
hordes and cattle.
As Philip once more stood upon the site.of Mal-
den, the recollection of Lilly came fresh into his
mind. How different the appearance now. When.
here before, it presented a busy scene of active
life, where groups of British and Indians were seen
engaged in making mirthfulness and sport. Here,
too, his eyes first rested upon Lilly after a long and
painful absence-here on this field of ruins--even
where he now stands he had experienced emotions
of happiness, inexpressibly exquisite.
But now Lilly was secure in the care of her
father, while her captors and enemies were flying
fugitives. Proctor and Tecumsels and their pretty
minion, Montour, with his cowardly fellows were
retreating up the Thames before their pursuers.
,The troops of Harrison had advanced within
three miles of the Moravian town, within one mile
of the enemy.
On he 5th: they were discovered in a skillfully
chosen position. A narrow strip of dry land flank..
ed by the river Thames lay on their left, and a.
swamp on their right. This position was occupied
by the regular :infantry arid artillery, while on the
right    k lay Teeumseh and.his followers, on the'
east    margin of the swamp. The position  of
the enemy was the most judicious and advantageous;

that the troops disposed in such order as Proptor
had made, could not resist the charge of mounted
men.
At the coniiand of their gallant leader, the
mounted men comufrienced the charge.
Behold with what impetuosity hey rush upon
the charging squadrons-even up to the, conne -i
mouth, and the flashing musketry, blazing 'forth
their fires of death-the melee of". horses- and
riders mingled with the roar of artillery, and the
shouts of infuria ted combattants, rushing upon
each other, changed that hitherto , silent forest
into a scene of excitement and daring and horror
that made many a heart turn cold. Next came the
piles of 'dead and dying, whose pitiful groans, re-
vealed a world of woe in their dying agonies.
The hiovement was .successful,--.and that firm,
solid earth rooted line was broken, and piles of
mangled .human flesh lay strewn: over the earth.
Upon the left the contest raged with, most despe-
rate and appalling severity.
There stood the exasperated savages unwilling
to yield the ground, while the cowardly Procter
had fled the field leaving. Tecumseh, and his, war-

conqueror die. Brave fellows-! hehe tey stood
animated by their gallant leader, pouring d h

around 'themlining men fell, at every disclrges
Tecumseh's voice is' the den of battle animating
his men to stand their ground-but the fire of
their enemies was growing too warm. - His warriors
were falling, around him-and he saw the tide 'of
battle' rollingagainst him.
" To, the: woods-to, the woods," shouted the ir
brave and daring leader; and the next moment
the Indians were seen flying across the hills to
seek shelter in a piece of woods on the left, fol-
lowed by the Americans. Here Tecumseh made


256              PIoNEa LIfE,
one more desperate effort. A considerable body
of Indians had collected here, and the struggle be-
cams desperate, and for a'few moments the victory
seemed doubtful.
Heie'again were seen flaunting .banners and
gaudy plumes waving and tossing in the air, while
the rattle of drdms, shouts of war mingled with the
roar of musketry; iaid above the heads of the ex-
abperated belliggerents, rose dense volumes of
black, sulphurousJ-smoke curling in heavy festoons
among the forest trees. The contest grows'warmer
still, and for a moment the field seems to be lost.
But no !--behold yonder moving cloud of advancing
wrriors--the weary eyes of Tecumseh gaze with
the most intense interest upon those moving ob-
jects.
"Indians, Indians," shouted the brave and ex-
cited Colonel, "steady nien, steady-all now de-
pends upori your valor."
Onward canie' the advancing band, with the speec
and eiergyof the rushing tempest and in a few
moments another voice rent the air, exclaiming.:
"'Tigthe gallent Beaver-courage men he comes

But merciful heavens! what a soul sickening
  picture lay before the victors -.all around are piles
of mangled human beings-some dead and spne
dying, while the ground, (strewn with the imple-
ments of war) is drinking up the warm current of
life.
Philip and his companions had been in the heat
of the battle, and strange to tell, had passe&amp; though
it all unhurt. On several occasions they had nar-

the elevation of military Chieftains, into noteriety
over the destruction of the human family. Look
at ,.e mad expedition of Xerxes against the Gre-
cians-the ambition of Alexander and his succes-
sors-the bloody contests between Rome and Car-
thage, called the Paunic wars-- the mad expeditious
of Csar and Pompey-the heart-rending scenes of
human suffering produced throughout Asia and
Africa by Mahomet, and the ferocious and hellish
butchers of the Christian nations by the devilish
Turks- I say when we call to mind all these, with
the many horrible and bloody butcheries of modern
times, in which innumerable cities, towns and vile
lageshave been laid waste-provinces and empires
overturned, and niisery and suffering entailed upon
countless thousands of the human race-we must
unequivocally pronounce war the most appaling
scourge which can befall any people or nation."
"Alfred," repliedPhilip," I am fully pursuaded
of the fruth of your remarks. But wars and rumors
of wars pvill exist, be they right or wrong, as long
as the principle of wrong remains in the human
heart. With you I have often deplored with all
the feelings of humanity, this mammoth evil. But
you or 'I ca not remedy 'it. We find it existing and
atteiptiing the destruction of our rights, and' true
t. the instiit "of self-preservation we are prompted

listened "verY attentively to the desertation of-

"Brilly's the chump." replied Philip, "he hates
any act that, would render either his moral or
physical nature obnoxious to society."
"I underthand yer," replied Billy, and wduld
thay that I'm obliged to yer, for the compliment.''
The young men, who had been seated upon -the
trunk of a tree, arose, and passing some distance
along the woods suddenly came upon the body of
a wounded Indian. He had fell wounded in the ac-
tion, aid dragging himself short 'distance, rolled
himself into a depression of earth made by the up-
heaval of a tree. Here lay the poor fellow, suffer-
ing under several flesh wounds.-On seeing our
heroes he cast upon them a pitiful look, and thus
addressed them in good plain english:
"Gentlemen, I am dying. My -span of life is at
its close. This beautiful world will sqoi be hid
from me forever. 1'Yhave fallen in lightning for the

whence t came. One word with you before 1

.On the Black Fork of Mohican lied the noted
Captain Pipe,tonce my particular friend. He has
a beautiful daughter-I loved her ; she refused my
hand-I managed to steal her from her father-
again I proffered her my hand---but she scornfully
refused it-I threatened her with violence, but she,
defied all my threats and called upsen the curses of
heaven to rest upon me--that prayer was like a'
poisonous shalt sunken into my heart, and for a
moment I trembled under her solemn denunciation
and indignant frown,-Finding I could not gain her
consent to wed me,'I left her presence, hoping to
conquer her' at another period. On returning 1
found her gone ; this enraged me, and reckless off
of consequence I threw myself into'battle, determin-
ed to glut my vengeance on the white -race, from
whom her father and herself had sought protege'
tion.
It, may be, you may chance to see her or her
father-nay, I would say, you would confer upon
your dying enemy one favor, (though undeserving
of it,) by' sending to hinm who is now in Cleveland,
if yet living, my dying request for him and his' in-
sulted daughter to pardon me. This act alone is
all that niow troubles me. In fighting you'and your
race I have done my duty, but in tearing the young.
lady from  the protection of" her aged father to
whom she is bound by the closest ties of affection, I
have outraged the principles of a gentleman."
Philip was much moved at', this confession of'
Montour, for 'twas he who spoke, and taking him"
by his hand, besmeared wit  blood, he raised hun
off the ;ground, in order that he might gather some.
leaves under his body and- head.-Then addressing

ment, almost regardless of consequences.
I sir, am one of the deliverers of that young
woman of whom you speak, and these are my.com-
panions m the iunder-taking. We have traversed
the forests of Ohio in all directions in search of
her; we found her in the garrison of Malden, and
she is now happy under the protection of her
fther ; and now sir, I want you to understand that
you are forgiven. I speak what I kiiow-and if
Onishishsha were here she would lay her hand
upon your dying head, and say to you as her Divine
Master said'to his murderers, "Father forgive him,"
for Onishishsha is a christian.
4iTis enough," said the dying Indian, "my breath
grows short-it comes heavily on-darkness is
gathering around mie--my eyes are growing dim-.
the'objects of earth are receding from my sight-I!
am going-farew    "            T
"Its all over with -him,' said Philip, whose eyes
wore.dimmed with tears,; "poor fellow! he's gone
to join the company of his gallant comrades, and his
noble hearted commander, who this day have bid,.
their forest homes adieu forever."
"Poor, fellow !' said Alfred, whose heart during
this melancholy interview, was deeply touched by
the Indian's melting pathos. '"Poor fellow !' re-
peated he, "after all I cannot help mourning his
untimely fate-what a noble looking young war'
nrior--so much unlike his brethren-his language,
how beautiful, and his enunciation, even under the
pangs of death, how soft and clear. But his days

Beyond the cloud capped hcavcns

Well, well, said Billy, who during this sorrow-
ful scene, had sat a sa silent spectator, and in whose
bosom also, the fires of compassion had been kind-
led-" I cannot but feel thorry too; after all I
think you  did right in thpeaking kindly to th is
Inthun."
"Yes Billy," said Alfred, "we must always re-
member the language. of our great commander liar-
rison, "that the revenge of a soldier cannot be grati-
fled on a: fallen enemy. Acts of kindness' under
such circumstances is the noblest revenge, as they
leave no unpleasant feelings behind them."
Thus ended the conversation, and the young
heroes again joined the soldiers in the camp where
the officers were making preparations to bury the
dead.
The day after the battle the American troops
took possession of the Moravian towns where they
found large quantities of such provisions'as they
stood in need of.
Among-the trophies of this battle were six brass
field pieces, surrendered by Hull, on two of which
was the uotto-" surrendered by Burgoyne at Sara-
toga."
The villages were found entirely desolated,. and
so panic struck were some of the squaws that they
threw their children into the river, to prevent them.
froi being butchered by the Amerians. For the
reason that the inhabitants of these towns had
beerloet active, in conmitting depredations igon
the frontier settlements, the soldiers reduced them
to ashes before leaving them.

A few days after this battle, Philip and his com-
panions proceeded down the river Raisin, on their
way to the cavern of Captain Pipe, where he
safely arrived, without much difficulty, just as
the shades of evening were gathering over the
forest.

CHAPTER XXXX.
MEETTING WITH JOHNNY APPLESEED.
"Thoy met again where Tolls the flood
01 waters down Sandusky's shore."
Immediately after the bloody battle of the Thames,
our heroes returned to the cave of Captain Pipe,
where they were joyfully received.by the old Indian
and his daughter.
The old man manifested much joy on hearing of
the brilliant victories of the American army, and
expressed it as his opinion that in the fall of the
notorious Tecumseh, fell the hopes and expectations
of the British arms in the west. And such was
really the fact;
On his return from the battle of the Thames,
General Harrison was met at Detroit by a delega-
tion of Indians, consisting of Ottawas, Chippewas.
Pottawatamies, Miamies and Kickapoos, begging
for a suspension of hostilities. They agreed to
take up the same tomahawk with the Americans
anid strike all who were or might be enemies of
the United States, and in order to prove their sin-

cerity they offered their women and' children as
hostages.
From this period till the final close of the *war,
those Indians faithfully supported the American
cause, with as much ardor and zeal as they. ad
previously opposed it.
The consternation which had spread over te
west at the. commencement of the war, was now
gradually subsiding.  Indian depradations    re
less frequent, and the terror stricken-inhabitaints
were seen leaving .the Forts. and Block  oue , in
order to re-commence their farming operations.
But while a partial peace was smiling=oivr }the
North-West, the demon of :war,,was rollihg hi
chariot of death ovgr other partsof the eoutntry,
particularly along the Lake;and Sea coast.
Our heroes, after -their return from the Thames,
had made arrangements, for , joiningthe forces ut
der Gen, Scott,,b  finding that, the arny had in-
creased and that there w's -fo- lack, of soldiers,
they changed their opinion, and; concluded to 'spend
the winter with the Captain and 'his daughter.
The cave of Captain Pipe, as already noticed was
situated in a most delightful hunting country. It
was krown to but few, and those hardly evrtisit.
ed it, and .consequently, it was well calculated as a
safe retreat from marauding bruds of tIdialts It
was therefore agreed upon thatthis cave shouId be
their' head quarters during  the winter, should
they spend -i in the exciting pleasures of the
chase.                  r  t    .,  a"
Accordingly, in. a ferdays after 'their turn
from  the war, they had made every arrangement
necessary for the winter's hunting excursiom.
It was a beautiful morning  eyrds the close:of

thomewhat more thanged in yer lQokth than uth-

whereupon he introduced Johnny to his friend,
who had stood gazing in mute astonishment upon
this odd specimen of human nature.
After the joy and excitement produced by the
appearance of Johnny had subsided, 'the friends
gathered around the camp fire, when Johnny rela-
.ted the history of his adventures since he had left
his friends on the Black Fork.
"Gentlemen," said Johnny, in commencing the
narration of history, "1I am thankful to the Great
Giver of ever good and perfect gift, that we have
been spared to see each other's faces once more.
But since we last met together, our lives have
been crowded with sorrow and disappointment. We
have been made to drink of the bitter cup of affig-
tiori. You Mr. Seymour, have undergone oneof
the most severe trials that can come within the
experience of human life. In one short hour you
were made a homeless and friendless stranger.
On hearing of the outrage on Black Fork I repair-
ed thither imraediately-I was in Mt. Vernon at
'the time the murder of your friends' occurred.
The news of this transaction produced a' high
state of excitement among the whites. Spies were
sent out in all directions to watch, the movements
of the savages.
On reaching the settlement, I found every cabin
tenantless, and on calling at the Block House at
Beam's Mill, I found that most of the families had
taken refuge there  I made inquiry concerning
you and Billy, but no one could give me any satise
factory account of you after .the burgl of your
'friends ; no one. had seen you since. t then 'let

murder, with feelings of most bitter anguish; and
as I gazed upon your father's cabin, (where but a'
few weeks~ ago all was peace -andI happiness) and

saw the work of the .destroyer, I felt more deeply
th ndver the solemn truth that all that's mortal
mst decay      Ab, sir, to me that cabin looked de-
s61te andf dreary-its walls were silent as the
grave ; and with the exception of yourself its once
happy inmtes were now resting in peace under
thegreen sod that lines the banks of the rippling
aties, along which their mangled remains were
degdsitede Ah ! sirs,'as I gazed upon that sacred
spot, I remembered that the spirit of at least one
of the silent sleepers there was feasting -upon the
rich-manna of heaven--and though I wept over the
grge of myyoung disciple, yet I rejoiced to know
that her. sufferings were forever past, and that
she wold be, a star in my crown of glory in the
spiritaland.:
.After spendinga few hours here, I directed my
way to Mansfield, nd on arriving there I found'the
inhabitantsm'ina high state of excitement concerning
tke outrage on Black: Fork. Orders were given to
shoot every straggling Indian found in the woods.
I zeained a, few days in the Block House at Mans-,
fiand then returned to Mt. Vernon where I spent
the winter. On the return of Spring I visited my
n series wpich lay scattered along the different'tri-
butries of the Mohicain. Having bestowed upon
thern the requisite attention, -[resolved to open up,
or extend my sphere of usefulness. Accordingly
I found my way to this region of Ohio, where I
have hkeenfor several months past planting nurse'
ries. As U lay in camp a few hundred yards up
thi stream I saw the light of your camp-fire ; and
wishiungto know who you were L came down the
stream, under cover of darkness, and recognizing
your voice, :entered your camp, taking you by
surprise.',
"Yes, aund by hokey," said Philip, " the surprise
was'. ost complete."
'Well,"mpid Johnny, "have you ever heard any-
thing of our friend Captaig Pipe ?"

"Heard from him ?" ejaculated Philip. "Cer-
tainly-l left his residence but a few days ago!"
"Ah ! indeed," said Johnny," "then he is in
Cleveland yet."
'"No, Mr. Chapman, not there. Let me think--1
believe you have not heard of the deep affliition
through which the old man was called to pass after
his arrival in Cleveland."
" No, sir," replied Johnny  "has any misfortune
befallen him ?"
"Yes, Mr. Chapman, replied Philip, and then re-
lated to him the particulars of' Lilly's abduction,
and her rescue from the garrison at Ft. "Malden.,
"Poor child !" said Johnny, "I will see her 'im-
mediately. I will visit her once more, and . ask
the protection of the Great Spirit to be thrown
around her."
" Such a visit," replied Philip "would indeed, be
most cheering to both the - Captain and Lilly.
They often speak of you, and wonder where you
are, and what' you are doing. They had almost
come to the conclusion that you had been murder-
ed by some of the sav:res."
" Well," .said JoLnny, "we will lay down and
take our rest, and in the morning we will return
to the cave ; and thus ended the conversation for
the present, and the little company lay down to
seep.
Morning came, but before the golden sun had lit
up the dark forest, the company were on their way
to the cavern, which they safely reached the next
day about nightfall.
On entering' it, the first object that met his gaze
was his young disciple Lilly. Philip and his com-
panions- had remained outside, until Johnny had
surprised the Captain and his daughter, after which,
and just in time to witness the manifestations of
joy, they also entered.
"Mr. Chapman !" exclaimed the young maiden,

"God bless the dear child," replied Johnny, at
the same time grasping her delicate hand in his.
"God bless the dear child." repeated he, with tears
in his eyes; and for a moment he stood gazing re-
verently upon the lovely young creature.
,Capt. Pipe, who was reclining upon his pallet of
skins in another department, on hearing Lilly men-
tion the name of Mr. Chapman, sprang to his feet
and the next moment stood before his friend.
"Mr. Chapman," exclaimed the Chieftain, "you
are welcome here."
"Captain," replied Johnny, "we meet at this
time under singular circumstances. But the ways
of Providence are truly wonderful, and in many
instances, incomprehensible to us short sighted
creatures. Since we last met, you indeed have met
with much sorrow ; but I am rejoiced to know that
you are now comforted.

CHAPTER XXXXI.
CAPT. PIPES INTERVIEW WITH JOHNNY APPLESEED--DISCLOs
URES RESPECTING LILLY'S ORIGIN-ITS EFFECTS UPON THE
MIND OF ALFRED.
But it is not necessary to tax the reader's patien-
ce with a recital of the conversation which passed
between the members of that happy circle on.that
interesting occasion. Suffice it to say, that their
conversation  related principally  to the happy
scenes of other days.
On the next morning Cap. Pipe and Johnny re-
tired some distance from   the cave, and seating
themselves upon the ,trunk of i fallen Iree, com-
menced a low yet earnest conversation, "Mr. Chap.
man," said the Captian," you are aware, I suppose,
that Lilly and, Mr. Seyxnour, have formed an at-
tachmnent for each other :-and I suppose from what
Lilly has said.to me, will be married in a few days.
Well I have taken this occasion to hold ' :private
interview with you" respecting the origin of her,.
whom most people suppose to be my real daughter
Youtand Mr. Seymour have long since been aware

that she is not my real daughter. Sir," continued
the Chieftain, Lilly is, the real sister of the com-
panion of Mr. Seymour, young Bradley?
"Impossible !" exclaimed Johnny in much as-
tonishment, "Impossible" continue he, looking full
into. the Captains face, unable to give credence to
his words-" By no means," replied the Captain,
"it is even so, Lilly Pipe is none other than Anne
Bradley, the sister of Alfred Bradley now in the
cavern."
"Captain," replied Johnny," I beg your pardon,
for the insult offered you in discrediting your
word, but you really astonish me: yet, in this I
learn another lesson of God's goodness to his dear
creatures-How strange are the ways of Providen-
ce-At this moment Alfred is talking to her, whom
he supposes to be now in the Spirit world. God in
his goodness has brought them together, yet they
know it not, and so saying Johnny relapsed into
silence, overwhelmed by his feelings; and had the
reader been standing by on this occasion, he would
have seen tears of joy rolling down the sunburnt,
and weather beaten cheeks of that tender hearted
child of nature.
1Mr. chapman," replied. the Chieftain-you
weep--but your tears are those of joy. Listen and
I will tell you now-"
The next year after the treaty at Greenville
(17,) a, party of whites landed at the mouth of
Conneaut Creek about the middle of Summer,a
lovelier place was nowhere to be. found. After re-
maiing here for a while they left. A few families
however; remained over minter there, did not be-
long to the party which first landed,-but emigrated
here in the fall. One of these was the family of
Mr.1Bradley.

appeared cheerful and happy, though in distitute
circumstances. We remained with them oer night.
The next morning we started home. On entering
the woods about a half' mile from the cabins we
came upon two white children who had, as usual
wandered some distance up the stream to play.
They had on this occasion, however, wandered far-
ther way from their cabins than was usual-and
had become bewildered. We rode up to them, and
found that they were lost, we asked them if they
wanted to go home; the elder replied, yes, I then.
took up the smaller one on my horse while Black
Hoof took the elder. Poor creatures, they sobbed
and cried fit to break their little hearts, we pitied
them, and were about turning back to take them
to their homes, when Black Hoof' urged that we
should carry them home with us and'adopt them in
our families. The suggestion was agreed to, and
we departed with our prisoners : and in due time
arrived. at our villages-Black Hoof adopted his
into his family, and I named mine Onishishska and
adopted her into my family. She was afterwards
called Lilly as you have heard, Lilly at the time of
her capture was just beginning to talk, from which
circumstances I judged she was About three Sum-
mers old-her companion was some older, as was
apparent from her size and speech.'
After a few weeks Lilly became reconciled to
her lot,, and grew cheerful and merry. She was
handsome, and I loved' her because she was so
playful and kind. As she grew older she became
more attractive, and learned to love me with the
fondness of a child. Igave heriall the iiistfuction
in my power, as you have been informed
And now, I deem it my 'duty to give her' up into
the care of her lover end' brother, and attone in
some measure for the wrong which I have done her

and remained silent for a moinent. It was evident
his feelims had overcome him, Johiny had sat
silent and pensive, tears had coursed their way
down his cheeks ; but commanding his feelings, he
thus addressed the old Indian.-.
"eCaptain Pipe, you seen deeply affected in re-
conthin the past; but these scenes are over, and
we live in the present. You did wrong in taking
the child from'its home, but you have done right
in bringing it up under good ,and wholesome . in-

" But," ..enquired Johnny," had you not better
see them all before you leave !"
As you think best replied the Captain," and the
two companions started for the cave, which after
bidding the company a "good bye,' he left never
to return again. The Captain's departure had
been expected by Philip and Lilly: as =he had pre-
viously spoken to them on this point; and, although
they could not comprehend his reasons. for thus
leaving them, yet they had no. idea that his depart-

Although Lilly's feelings were pensive, and" her
heart deeply smitten with sorrow at.parting-with
him whom she had been taught to callfather; yet
she could not help smiling, though tears were stand-
ing in her eyes, at the earnestness and assurance
with which Billy had addressed her.
After Billy had spoken, the whole company as-
sumed a more composed and cheerful aspect. John=
ny Appleseed, now concluded to communicate to
the company the disclosures of the Captain..
"Y Children," said he, "L want your'attention ;t
have news for you-news, which perhaps, ill as=
tonish you, and which you will scarcely credit, but:
which though almost incredible- is nevertheless
true. 'Mr. Bradley, Miss' Pipe is your Sis" -"
But before he could finish his -sentences young
Bradley, uttered an exclamation of " MetifulHe -

At length the young man spoke once more. "It
is Anne-it is Anne repeated he-" Oh Anne well
do remember you in your 'infant days, but you
carint remember me. How much you look like our
nother-dear mother-now in heaven---shining
amid=the saints of light, and -I have no doubt at

brother and-sister after an absence of long years--
Oh Anne you are the very picture of that dear Saint.

it. Oh!God  how thankful ought I to be for such
happiness-long years have passed away since I

you haoe grown to womanhood, and we meet in the

During this brief but solemn andheartfelV offer

were now no little astonished on beholding this
treasure,-
"Lilly," exclaimed Billy, "it ith yourth-all
yourth, and hang me for a story if you haint en-
ough to buy half a dosthen of thuch felloth ath
Philip.
"No, no," replied Lilly, much amused at Billy's
expression-It is. not all mine-see here, there
(handing him several gold coins and a couple of
ornaments,) are yours."
"Thank you-thank you," said Billy, and for
your dithtinguithed kindneth, permit me to with
you and Philip much happineth when the time
cometh round to do tho."
Ah ! Billy replied Philip, your dreaming again.
"What! about thaketh," replied Billy.
" Confound you and the snakes," cried Philip, I
expect you'l haunt me through all eternity with
the remembrance of those days of snake memory.
On returning to the cave, Lilly divided the valu-
ables equally among her companions, but Johnny
refused taking any. Arrangements were next
discused for paying one more visit to the home-
steads upon the Black Fork. Accordingly. horses
were procured and in a few days every thing was
got in readiness for starting.
It was towards the middle of October, one beau-
tiful morning, when our heroes left the cave for
the Black Fork. All were mounted upon horses,
fiery and full of animation. Philip was appointed
the leader or Captain. Before leaving the cave,
the party bowed respectfully, to that subteranean
refuge, and left in silence. It had been the home
of one of the noblest spirits that roamed this for-
' est, and it had been the refuge of one of the rarest
flowers of the wilderness.
It is needless to describe the incidents of their
journey to the Black Fork. Of course it was attend'
ded with that joy and' hilarity peculiar to all such
excursions.

Towards the close of the second day after leave-
ing the cave, the company found themselves at the
door of what once was the domicil of Capt. Pipe, and
the home of the affectionate and tender hearted
Lilly. There had she spent the days of her child-
hood and the sight of her old homestead brought
up in her mind the 'early associations of life. As
the shades of night were setting in upon the forest
it was agreed that the company should spend the
evening in the cabin : accordingly the horses were
made fast within an enclosure, and supplied with
grass, of which there was an abundance around the
house, and after preparing themselves with some
refreshments, the little company seated themselves
around the bflizing fire and entered into a conver-
sation upon the scenes of the past. Each member
of that interesting group had his own story to tell,
but none was so touching as Lilly's.
'She was now once more under the roof of her once
happy cottage home, on the banks of her loved and
romantic Black Fork.
The poet when seeking a theme for his loftiest
verse, will-turn with affection and pride to his early
home, where first he felt the divine inspirations of
poetic fire, where first he roamed the wild wood, or
listened to the warbler's note, gleaning something
around which he might weave with God-given pow-
er, his glowing fancies.
It matters not if the home be lowly, love and-
poetry will find sweet music in the babbling rivu-
let--affections within the cottage wall-every
breeze that trembles, every flower that lifts its, cha-
lice to the sun, and every bird that warbles its
gladsome lay, brings to us reminescences of early
home. The memories of home will find a cahn de-
light in the hour of sun set, when the King of day
is slowly sinking behind the western hills, and
pouring his unclouded blaze of light on all surroun-
ding objects-AAh, yes, and when the weary exile

is riding far over the world of waters, along some
distant shore, the beams of the sinking sun, rest-
ing upon the hushed deep, or gilding the green
billows and sending back to the eye, an increased
radiance, will bring to mind the brightness and
cherished glories of the home of his youth.
Thoughts of our early home will crowd upon the
mind wherever we may roam, and when after a
lapse of years we revisit the sacred spot, what deep
emotions fill our minds. Who that has visited the
home of his youth has not felt that time, and dis-
tance has lent enchantment to the spot.
Such, were the reflections that passed through
the mind of Lilly, as she sat gazing upon the va-
cant wall of that forest cot, once the home of her
youth.
There, and within this rude enclosure had she
often sat upon the knee, and by the side of him,
whom she called father, and listened to his simple
tales of Indian life-here too, she had often ming-
led in the company of her dark eyed forest com-
panions, had rambled.- thl them along the grassy
and flower decked banks of the rippling stream-
here, and under the cool shade of the forest, she
had often and often listened to the music of the
feathered songsters ; here, and upon this grassy
lawn, she had time, and time again, gazed upon
the sinking sun, until his last, golden rays rese
high along the distant hills, and left the shades of
night to follow in their wake--There too had she
sat in other days, looking up in the dark dome
of heaven, and watching as she supposed the
Great Spirit lighting up the heavens, with his cel-
estial fires, manifested in the appearance, one
after another of the brilliant stars.
Lilly was a child of nature, which in all its depths
was replete with music to her soul-She saw a
beauty and heard a music in the stillness of the
twilight hour, and in the voice -of the balmy

breeze, as it sighs amid the stirring leaves of the
starlit grove, or reposing upon the unruffled bosom
of the placid waters-She had heard and realized
that there was music in the glad songsters of the
grove ; and felt that there was the voice of the
Great Spirit in the mutterings of the pealing thun-
ders above -or on earth-in the out spread skies
and in the invisible air-in the solitary dell, or
upon the gentle hilltop-in the ever changing glo-
ries of the footstool of the Almighty, or among the
ever burning celesteai lights, which gem the high
firmament, and light the angels to their evening
orisins, in all, through all, and over all, as though
from ten thousand times ten thousand harps, she
heard the sweetest melody, pouring from earth, air
and the heavens; all conspiring to make her forest
home the abode of happiness. in short, may we
not add that in those palmy days this music was
the atmosphere of heaven to her innocent spirit,
and that she looked upon the green crested earth
and the star spangled heavens, as the lyre of the
Great Spirit, whose strings were touched by him
alone; sending out strains of Divinest melody.
Thus sat Lilly for some moments, in a kind of
dreamy listlessness, while thoughts of other days
were passing through her mind. She looked a-
round. for her father, but he was not there, his
voice was not heard among the voices there. How
changed, even the old cabin seemed to mourn his
absence. Months and years had passed since her
first recollections of this sacred cot, and now for
aught she knew, she had taken refuge in it for the
last time. Tears filled her eyes, and rising from
her seat she made her way to the grove, a few
steps in the rear of the cabin, where in other days
she had often sat musing upon the beauties of the
glowing landscape around. The sun was just hiding
his golden face behind the tree tops, and his glow-

ing beams came streaming through the forest trees,
in long lines of golden light -
The sight of a setting sun is glorious at all times,
but to Lilly, on this occasion, it was a melancholy
sight. How often in other days had she beheld that
same sun setting, in cloudless glory behind the
same forest trees, had heard the same hum of noct-
urnal insect choristers, chiming their evening lays
to Luna, the bright queen of the stilly night, and
with what joyous emotions, and kind good feelings,
had she sat in this same shady bower conversing
with her red faced companions, of coming life and
future prospects.
There flowed the same beautiful stream, here
stood the-same forest, now clothed in garments of
mourning, as the chilling frosts of autumn, cold win-
ters precursor, were beating heavily upon it, here
stood the same cottage, around which were grow-
ing the same plants and wild flowers, which, in
other days she had woven into boquets for some
loved one.
Musing upon the past, she thus sat, for some time,
until aroused by the voice of Alfred calling her to
the cabin.
Returning to the cabin she found the company
preparing to retire to rest.
Lilly lay down upon her pallet of skins, but could
not close her eyes in sleep. Visions of the past
haunted her mind-Long, long days had passed
away since last she had closed her eyes in sleep in
this lone cottage; here she was once more, under
the same roof, which had sheltered her in her in-
fancy from many a rude tempestuous wintry storm,
but the heart in whose affections she had lived for
years, was not with her, it was the first night she
had ever spent in that cabin without him; and this
though seemed to rend her young heart assunder.
She wept bitterly, and in weeping found relief-.
Hours thus passed until overcome, she fell asleep,

from which she did not awaken until aroused by
the voice of her brother calling her to their morn-
ing meal.
Lilly arose, more cheerful than when she lay
down on the preceeding evening, and after saluting
her companions, begged them to excuse her drowsi-
ness. She expressed herself much refreshed, and
commenced preparations for the day's journey.
Towards the middle of the day, the party (which
had left the cabin about 9 o'clock that morning,)
arrived in front of the door of the Seymour cabin.
Philip's mind was deeply affected on once more
gazing upon his former home, and the scenes of
the past were called afresh into his memory.
Having secured their horses in the stable, the
whole company entered the cabin. Like the form-
er its walls were vacant, and silent-Once the
abode ofjoy and happiness, now silent and tenant-
less. A deep solemnity rested upon the minds of'
that little company, and for some moments not a
word was spoken. At length, Philip, who had been
gazing upon the naked walls for some moments, in
deep and solemn reflection broke the silence.
" Friends," said he. and his bos m heaved with
deep emotion-" I sand once more upon this blood
stained floor. I look around me, but I see not
those with whom  I associated in early life--This
rude domicil once contained two as cheerful and
happy hearts as ever sent the red current of life
through the veins of living mortals ; but, alas one
of these is no more. Under. yonders shady tree,
on the banks of that murmuring stream, repose
her last remains-the other now mourns her sad
and untimely fate."
"Ah !" replied Johnny, such is. human life.--Like
the flower, it fades and dies.-All thats mortal
must decay-nothing is real here, all is fitfull, fleet-
ing changing, and passing away. Dangers stand
Vhick around us, and sometimes when least expect-

ed, mortals are cut down in a moment. But here,
(taking a Testament from his bosom) here is the
hope of our Salvation and immortality-In this
blessed volume we are told the righteous shall
live forever-then, Mr. Seymour, why mourn her
exit from earth-She lives in a holier and happier
clime. I have seen the righteous die ; but I have
never seen an end to the mercy of the Redeemer-
it fades not, neither does it die. Tis true we are
under the influence of natural affection, and this
often times leads us to mourn when we should re-
joice."
"Tis all true, Mr. Chapman," replied Philip, I
am aware that we must all soon pass into another
state of existence ; yet fond recollection lingers
arround the sacred Spot where love reposes. To
those who never knew a sister's love, and have
never wept over a sister's grave, such feelings as I
now possess, they have never realized. True the
Poet has said.
When memory fondly lingers near
The silent grave where love reposes
And sheds with burning eye the tear,
On the pale wreath of withered roses
Some Seraph formin brightness clad,
Comes to dispell the gloom of sorrow
Bids the lone mourners heart be glad,
And whispers "She will wake tomorrow."
"Yes," replied Johnny, although I am not much
inclined to favor poetical quotations in religious
affairs, yet I must acknowledge this a true speci..
men of poetic truth-" She will wake tomorrow-
cheering thought."
There the conversation ended, and the whole
company bent their steps to the graves of their pa-
rent and sister of Philip, and also that of the gal-
lent Ruffner.
There said Philip, pointing to the graves of his
sires, lay the remains of my unfortunate parents.
"Peace to their ashes, and rest to their Souls,"
responded Johnny,
" And here," said Philip, lie the remains of poor

Kate"-and bending over her grave tears fell fast
from his eyes upon the cold sod, that covered her
from his sight. By his side stood the beautiful
Lilly, hanging upon the arm of her brother, ming-
ling their tears with those of Philip.
And- there said Philip, pointing to the remaining
grave, lies the mangled body of the heroic Ruffner,
who fell cut to pieces defending the bodies of those
alongside of whom he now sleeps."
Billy on seeing the grave of his master, threw
his body down upon it, and for a moment wept in
silence-he loved him, for Ruffner, had been more
like a father to him, than a master.
"Ah," said Billy, while tears fell fast from his
eyes, thith ith my mathterth latht rethting place.
I almotht with I wath lying by hith thide--and so
saving he sobbed alcud-Biliy, had passed through
dangers by night and by day, and by land and by
water-he had seen death strew the earth around
him, but never before was he so deeply moved.
Come, come, Billy said Alfred dry up those tears,
your master sleeps in peace---he has fought his last
battle, in defence of the helpless and innocent, and
future generations will mark the sacred spot where
the gallant dutchman fell-a monument will yet be
erected to his memory, and future generations will
visit his grave, and read the history of his untimely
fate."
After remaining some time at the graves of his
friends, Philip and his companions, returned to the
cabin, where they spent the night. It was the last
night that ever that company spent together on
the Black Fork.
During the remainder of the day, arrangements
had been made for visiting their friends in Penn-
sylvania. A pressing invitations was extented to
Johnny and Billy to accompany them. But they
refused, Johnny alleged that it was his duty to re-
main in the wilderness, until his mission was ended,

and Billy expressed a deep anxiety to accompany
Johnny, out west, at least as far as to Wappukonoetta
viliage.  It was therefore settled that the next
morning Philip and Alfred and his sister, would
start for Pennsylvaina, and Johnny and Billy would
return to the west--Night passed away and morn-
ing dawned.
As soon as the light of day, had broke over the
forest, the company were astir making prepara-
tions for the journey. The hour of separation
come ; and the scene which followed, we cannot
describe-old and tried friends were now to part-
part,,in all probability, to meet no more.
"Billy," said Philip, as he grasped him by the
hand, "it is hard to part with you--gou, who to
Mr. Bradley and myself, have been the master of
our sports and pleasant hours. In parting with
you Icannot but express a wish that your true and
generous heart never fall a prey to the tempter's
snare."
"Amen," replied Johnny who stood listening to
Philip's admontion with eyes sparkling with kind
go od feeling -" Amen," repeated he, Mr. Seymour
I feel that you speak the words of truth and So-
berness." Having shaken hands with all, Billy
advanced to where Lilly was standing, and taking
her by her soft atid delicate hand, said in a most
manly and dignified tone of voice-
"MithuttLilly I motht heartly congratulate you
on the accession of 'a new brother, and with two
thuch brave hearth ath hith and Philip'th, you are
thave even in a den of all the thnakes in the uni-
verth, and with thith knowledge I can then more
readily withdraw my protective arms from yer"
"Bravo, bravo," shouted Philip and Alfred with
one voice, while tears fell from their eyes.
Long live Bunty Billy, the-" Hero of Wappa-
konetta," cried Lilly, her full heart overflowing
with gratitude to the young backwoodsman. But

ere the echo of these voices had died away, the
parties had separated, one on their way to the east,
the other to mingle among the wild scenes of the
wilderness.
-CONCLUSION.
Years had passed away since the party above
described ,had parted on the banks of the Black
Fork. Each having looked upon the other for the
last time.
Towards the close of a beautiful Summer evening
in the year 1847, a stranger, stricken with years,
and in tattered garments, made his appearance at
the door of a beautiful little cottage which stood on
the banks of a small stream which runs through
one of the many romantic vallies of the west.
On knocking at the door the stranger was bid to
enter, and being shown a chair sat down, placing
his little budget by his side.
"A very beautiful evening sir," said the.stran-
ger to the proprietor of the house, a rather goode
looking middle-aged gentleman.
Yes, replied the host, nature is always beautiful-
but you seem weary, have you travelled far to
day?
About twenty miles, as near as I can judge, re-
plied the stranger.
A very remarkable walk sir, for one of your age,
replied the man of the house-but I suppose you
are used to this exercise.
"Friend," replied the stranger, I am as you per-
ceive well stricken in'years,I have seen full seventy
winters, and will see no more-my mission on earth
is completed, and I shall soon be gathered to the
habitation of my fathers. As you have supposed
I have been upon. my feet all my life, and have
been a sojourner in the wilderness, since called
upon my mission."

"I presume then, replied the host you are a mis-
sionary or Minister of the Gospel."
Yes sir, meekly replied the old man, while his
dim and sunken eyes, were filled with tears-I have
taught what I conceived to be the true doctrines
of the Bible, and expect shortly to eat the fruits
of my doings in a better land.
The manner in which the old man had spoken
these words, was deeply affecting, bringing tears to
the eyes of his hearer, who wishing to know more
of the singular stranger with whom he was conver-
sing, thus addressed him.
Sir it would give me much pleasure, and I have
no doubt much interest to know your history, which
I am satisfied is a most interesting one.
"Then," said the stranger, I will comply with
your request. I was born far away towards the
rising sun, upon the banks of oie of the most ro-
mantic streams which washes the shores of New
England. In early life I imbibed a fondness for
rural scenery, and often wandered from my home'
along the banks of the stream in quest of natural
curiosities, flowers and plants, Nothing gave me
more pleasure than listening to the music of birds,
and the hum of insects. I had thus grown up to
boyhood, conversing withlthe various objects of na-
ture around me ; I had received a limited educa-
tion, I had been taught the common branches of
education. One day while in the deep forest med-
itating upon the goodness of God, as exemplified
in creation (for I had received a pious education) I
heard, as I supposed a voice immediately behind
me, saying,-
"Arise run ye to and fro through the wilderness.
and bear the words of life to the heathen thereof''
I cast my eyes to where the sound proceeded,
but saw no living being. At first I was somewhat
astonished and no little alarmed. But then I re-
collected that a similar voice had spoken to the

291

prophet Samuel, and I concluded that it was the
voice of an angel, commissioning me to proclaim
the glad tidings of peace. Returning 'to my home,
I sought an interview with my parents and com-
municated to them my call to the ministry, as a
missionary, and expressed my , determination to
obey the summons.
I was about 18 years of age when I left the home
of my youth, for the perils of the wilderness. I
bent my steps to western Pennsylvania, where I
remained for some years, until it became settled
with white inhabitants ; from thence 'I made my
way into the Ohio forests, where I remained for some
years after the war 6f 1812, preaching and teach-
ing, and otherwise trying to benefit my fellows ;
Finding that my sphere of usefulness was diminish-
ing in Ohio, I left it a few years ago, and have
made my way into this region, where j shall lay
my wearied limbs forever at rest."
Your's indeed is a singular history, replied the
settler, but have you never been at home since
you left ?"
"Home," replied the old man while tears rolled
down his furrowed cheeks-" home," repeated he,
and his eyes shone with a lustre of divinity-I
have no home on earth. My home is over yonder,
and he raised his trembling hand, and pointed to-
wards the skies. But, continued he, there were
sunny spots in childhood's palmy days--and well do
I 'remember, the endearing affections of the home
of my youth-the fond smiles of a tenderhearted
mother, and the sweet kisses of an affectionate sis-
ter--all these endearing associations, I relinquish-
ed forever, and made the wild. wide forest, my
earthly habitation, and its wild beasts and wild
men my companions-the flower strewn earth, for
the past 40 years has been my only bed, and the
leafy grove or star spangled heavens my only shel-
ter-Rain or sunshine, wind or calm, wet or dry,-

all the sale to me. Mine has been a life of peril-
and of privations-yet I have been happy-.-
You may.imagine that there is no happiness out
side of the home circle-but [can assure you sir,
that in holding converse with -Nature's God
through the medium of his works, one realizes a
happiness never dreamed of in the home circle.
Go sir," as I have gone, alone, all alone amid the
dark tall trees of the forest-by the side of the
murmuring stream, or the placid lake, and there
let the heart meditate-and you will feel and ex-
perience the highest sense of enjoyment. In -ro
ving the Iorest you can inhale the sweet fragrance
of the flowers that fringe your path, you can hear
the sweet minstrelsy of the sighing winds through
the thick foliage of the trees, you can listen to the
heart cheering music of the featherd chorists, you
can gaze upon the deep blue sky, boundless in ex-
panse, and let your imagination carry you to the
home of the blest-and in all of this you will feel a
joy and happiness which are not found in the halls
of fashionable life.
Strange and mysterious being, who art thou?
asked the deeply interested settler, who had lis-
tened''to the deeply touching pathos of the old
man, as he spoke of his wanderings through the
forest.
I am a lone pilgrim, replied the old man, my
name is written in the Lamb's book of life, and read
there by all the hosts of heaven- I am journeying
to a country unseen by mortal eyes, where I shall
live and live forevermore.
But, I would know thy name, that I'might remem-
her thee, in after days, replied the settler.
My name responded the old man is Jonathan
Chapman; I am more familiarly known among the
people of western Pennsylvania, and northwestern
Ohio, as Johnny Appleseed.
"What !" exclaimed the settler ia much aston-

ishment, " Johnny Appleseed of Richland County,
notoriety ?"
The same replied Johnny, and casting his search-
ing eyes full into the face of the settler, asked him
if ever he had resided. there.
That replied the settler was my my home in 1811.
I was then a small boy, I recollect of seeing you
but I suppose you do not recollect me, On the
breaking out of the war, my father removed to
Cleveland, where we remained till the close of the
war, when we moved to this region.
"Well,"replied the old man, since you have seen
me in the prime of life, and as you now find me on
the verge of death, let me ask but one favor -of
you, in the name of him, in whose cause I have
lived and will shortly die.
Name it replied the generous settler-, name it
and your request shall be gratified.
I would ask the privilege of your house in which
to end my days, which you.may rest assured are but
few, for I feel that death is even now destroying
this earthly tabernacle of mine.
The cabin of my father, in other days, replied
the kind hearted settler, was always open to sup-
ply the wants of the destitute stranger; .and his
generous example shall be followed by his. son-
therefore, venerable old man, consider my house
your home."
Thank you, thank you, replied the old. pilgrim,
while tears fell fast and thick from his fine black
eyes.
The sun had already gone down, and: the shades
of night were setting in-the old man had walked
several miles during the day and was much fatigu-
ed-He begged =his host for a bowl of milk and a
piece of bread, at this moment the settler's wife, a
fine portly good looking lady opened the door and
announced supper waiting.
You'l please step out to supper said the settler,

but the old man begged to eat by himself. His re-
quest was granted, after which they retired to bed,
the old man persistingin sleeping upon the floor. Be-
fore retiring he asked permission to hold a spirit-
ual communion with the family, and taking from
his little budget, the work of life he opened and
read.
Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the
kingdom of Heaven-Blessed are they that mourn
for they shall be comforted--Blessed are the meek
for they shall inherit the earth-Blessed are they
which do hunger and thirst after righteouness; .for
they shall be filled-Blessed are the merciful, for
they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in
heart for they shall see God,-then closing the
book he invoked the blessings of heaven upon the
family, and lay down to rest.
Morning came. A bright and glorious sun rose
unclouded. A holy calm was spread over the land-
scape, while the forest echoed with the music of
the many feathered songsters which filled the
grove. But there was one within the walls of that
humble little cottage that saw not that rising sun
nor heard that soul in-spiring music, for on enter-
in g the room where the lonely stranger lay, it was
discovered that he had indeed gone to rest. He
was dead, he had died without a struggle, and up-
on his pale and bloodless lips rested the smile of
joy with which he died-Perhaps he had been con-
versing with his loved ones, who soothed and com-
forted his weary spirit in his dying moments.
Thus died Johnny Appleseed, who had lived a
moral blameless life, and had wandered like a de-
serted pilgrim through the dreary wilderness, a
stranger among strangers.
His remains are now lying near Fort Wayne,
Allen Co. Indiana.
The balance of our story is soon told. Philip
