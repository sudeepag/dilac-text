We cherish her memory with all we hold most dear, for fondly loved was our mother's friend. We often asked her of her girlhood, but she would smile upon us sadly, and smoothing back our curls, reply, "Not now, dear children." We found among her papers, after her death, some scat- tered manuscript, which we read with blended smiles and tears, keeping them as a memorial of one whose life to us seemed bright and beautiful as the sunbeams, which for a brief space gladdened her way. The shadows have passed for ever, and she hath won at last, " the spirit's rest."     SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS, CHAPTER I. "How fair upon the admiring sight In Learning's sacred fane. With cheek of bloom, and tresses bright, Glide on the graceful train. There is a bubble on your cup, By buoyant fancy nurs'd; How high its sparkling foam leaps up I Ye do not think 'twill burst." "UNWELL, girls, I really fear that in the exuberance of my spirits, I shall be guilty of some great impropriety, and there- by horrify that dignified piece of machinery, our honorable and august principal, Mrs. Irvine Brandon!" A merry peal of laughter followed this sally, for her imita- tion of their lady-tutoress was too good to be mistaken. "Really, young ladies," continued the lively girl, " you surprise me!  To smile in the refined age in which we live, is scarcely permitted, but to laugh is almost unpardonable ;" and her blue eyes glistened with merriment, ill according with the demure expression with which she tried to look on her companions. Mrs. Brandon, the subject of their merriment, was the   10       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. Principal of a select seminary for young ladies, in the vicinity of New-York, who prided herself upon thereputation she I ad acquired (deservedly, or not, we will not assert), for giving to those under her charge, a thorough knowledge of all branches, useful and ornamental, requisite to complete a young lady's education. "She was decidedly literary, and highly accom- plished," said her admirers, " firm, and judicious in the man- agement of her pupils." Her'husband (for there was a Mr. B-  seldom said any thing beyond " probably," ' possibly," "not sure," and such-like dubious expressions. Her pupils said little in her presence, but, when absent, many a jest at her expense, from the most daring, responded to, by approving smiles, from those more timid, spoke of but little affection. She had able assistants, good accommodations; so she flour- ished by 1' finishing" young ladies, to her own, if not their satisfaction. "Come, Carrie," said one of the little group around Caroline Gilmer," do tell us what has happened; you look so mysterious, that I am sure you have made a discovery." "Made a discovery! to be sure I have, and even Gertrude, who looks so calm, and indifferent, will be interested in my budget of news. I saw Mademoiselle flitting down stairs in her graceful manner, and, not that I have much curiosity, I merely followed her into the study-room, and there found Mrs. Brandon and Bony, plotting- some grand scheme. Madame accosted me with, 'This is not study hour, Miss Gilmer,' so I soon found the book I did not need, and as I left the room, heard something of I closing exercises, and exhibition;' so, girls, we are really destined to amaze ourselves, and others, by a public demonstration of talent which might otherwise have been lost to the world; and who knows," she continued, " who knows, but in some of the gazettes you will find a paragraph, headed ' Interesting Communication.-At Mrs. B--'s late exhibition, all eyes were turned on a new star in the literary world, whose brilliant debut gave promise of a bright career.   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. ' We wish Miss C--   G  all possible success in the course on which she is entering,' &c. Blot not your copies in amaze- ment, oh ye tiny embodiments of young ideas! Hark! there is our musical summons; I think I shall embalm that bell be- fore I leave these classic halls, I should like to retain its very echo!" "' It surprises me, Caroline Gilmer, to hear you talk in that manner; if regardless of yourself, you should think of the effect your example may have on others." "A second Brandon! worthy of such ,teachings. Hear, oh, ye seniors and juniors, ye learned and unlearned! hear me while I warn you never to countenance Miss Gilmer, by smil- ing at her nonsense, when you are favored with the perfect ex- ample of Miss Helen Glenn." Another burst of merriment was elicited by this oration, for Helen was no favorite, while Carrie was a general one. "Carrie, dearest, how can you ridicule Helen thus? see how much embarrassed she appears." '; Well, Gertrude, I cannot control my thoughts as you do, and I fear that when I pass from your gentle influence, I shall be more thoughtless still. You are all that I shall regret with tears, in leaving this dull place. How I wish you could re- turn with me to my own home! Cannot you, Gertrude? Eu- lalie has promised, and I intend to keep her until her uncle comes to claim her, and I hope that will not be for very, very long; they say he is a cold, selfish man, caring for none but himself." "I should be most happy to join Eulalie, but you know my mother is awaiting my return so anxiously, I could not now prolong my absence." "Well, you must come ; if not now, whenever it may be con- venient to do so. I want you to know mamma, you would love her at first sight. She does not resemble me, I assure you; but listen, there is the bell again," and a second summons brought them speedily to the presence of Mrs. Brandon.   12        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. "She wished," she said, " to inform the young ladies, that after due deliberation, and consultation with her colleagues, she had concluded (contrary to her established custom) so far, to gratify her patrons, and friends, as to solicit their presence at the close of the present session, when their annual examina- tion would take place, with some additional exercises. She had no doubt but the young ladies would acquit themselves honorably. The senior class who were about to pass from her care, and whom she regarded with the greatest affection, would, she was convinced, take pleasure in acceding to her wishes by preparing valedictory addresses, to be read by them on that sad but interesting occasion." ' With regard to these, she had only J to say, that in pre- paring copies of them for their friends, she desired them to be attentive to the directions of Mr. Washington Buonaparte Burns, to whose unwearied instructions they were indebted for that most desirable accomplishment, an elegant chirography." "Poor Bony looks more dismal than ever," whispered the incorrigible Carrie, to her neighbor Lizzie Reed, a timid girl dependent on Mrs. Brandon. "Hush, dear Carrie," she replied, " we shall be observed." I vote," persisted Carrie, ' that we send him a lamen- tation, signed by the senior class, written in Latin, French, and German, as a memorial of our penmanship; what say you, Lizzie?" A sigh was her only answer; Lizzie Reed had no sym- pathy for the wild gayety of Fortune's favorite. "The young ladies will return to the school-room," was slowly uttered by their dignified preceptress, which command was readily obeyed. ,/!   CHAPTER II. "The fondest, the purest, the truest that met, Have still found the need to forgive and forget." "THE young ladies of the senior class are at liberty to spend the afternoon in the study-room, in order to prepare their vale- dictories. I shall look in upon you in the course of an hour; if my presence be required before that, Miss Reed will be kind enough to inform me." So saying, Mr. Washington B. Burns bowed himself out of the school-room, and was soon followed by the class. They seated themselves with writing materials before them, yet none seemed inclined to apply to their task. "What a marvel to see Carrie in such a musing attitude!" said Effie Walton, a bright-eyed girl of some sixteen summers. "Yes, it is strange!" muttered Miss Glenn, somewhat abashed by the rebuff she had met with. "I  think," said Emma Martin, who was near, " it is well for you that she is quiet sometimes." "I would be obliged to you, Miss Martin, not to intrude your opinion on me unasked for." Emma smiled and glanced at Carrie, who still sat leaning her head upon her hand, apparently unconscious of what was passing around her. It was pleasant to watch the varied and expressive cohutenances of that little group, who had so long been associated together, nbw about to separate, and go forth upon their severed paths, some seemingly so joyous, while   ^  -4?4   -SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. others looked upon a future clouded by the past. Who might read their destinies? "Minnie Carleton, ask Miss Gilmer if it is the Blues or the Browns by which she is visited; but it must be the latter, for we all know Mrs. Brandon's counsels avail her little; even she is obliged to acknowledge that Carrie never can be a Blue!" "Thank you, Miss Walton, for reminding me of that dole- ful fact. 'A Blue' I do not wish to be: and as to Brown, if it is to make me the counterpart of dear old uncle Jacob of that same name, I prefer waiting awhile." "We like you better as yourself, wild Carrie," replied Effie, " so we shall not quarrel on- that score." "'Wild!' yes, that is my character. I believe you all think I never spend a thought, save on my own worthless self; but for once you are wrong, for here- have I been ten minutes at least wondering, in the benevolence of my heart, how I could better the condition of poor Bony. I cannot think of leaving him so sad and lonely. Eulalie! -what do you say: do you think Mademoiselle la Rue could fancy him . I should like a wedding before we go,-it would be capital." "'Non, oh non, ma chere,' it would not do!" she replied, looking with surprise on her friend, whose present serious air gave no token of the mirth-loving spirit within her. Carrie elevated her eye-brows, and looking round on her attentive audience, very demurely remarked,--' Eulalie intends to have him herself. Well, I knew you had a good heart; but I did not give you credit for so much philanthropy. What a comfort it will be, after the wearisome toils of the day are ended, to meet her bright smile,--fit reward for all his care! How will men wonder at the strange choice of' La Belle;' and some will even pity her, so young and fair: but I shall keep my sympathy for poor Mademoiselle." "My dear Carrie, do not trifle any longer," said Gertrude, laying a hand caressingly upon hers; (; look at Eulalie; I really believe she is weeping."   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        15 "Dear Eulalie, she is so sensitive; 'how thoughtless of me. and she so lonely, With so few to care for her ;" and she sought the young girl's side, and throwing her arm around her, kissed away the falling tears. "I did but jest," she pleaded; " they laughed at me,--not you; you know I love you too well, Mig- nonne, to teaze you. But we are friends still, are we not 2 0 let me sit beside you, and we will write together: and you shall read my theme and play the critic!" and she smilcd,- the happy, loving smile that few could resist. And Eulalie Raimond, or "La Belle," as she was playfllly styled, forgot her loneliness, in hearing Carrie's winning words. - Avez-vous des tableaux vivants?" questioned Monsieur De Ville, entering the room some half hour after, and smiling as he advanced towards the animated group around. Carrie Gilmer, who, having achieved a victory, held Effie's manuscript high above her head, while she pleaded for its recovery. "Do give it to me, Carrie,-just allow me to review it." "Miss Walton excels in the style 'mourant"Monsieur," replied Carrie; " but I shall speedily restore her." So saying she placed the treasure in her hand, and kissed her cheek; then passing on, continued: "I must practise elocution; so, Ger- trude, give me yours; you need not say a word,-I can easily resist your entreaties." Monsieur De Ville, professor of the French language, was not young, but he had a warm  and kindly heart; he had not outlived his youthful feelings, but could still sympathize with the young in their little griefs and joys. He folded his arms and seating himself passively in the chair Carrie placed for him, prepared to give seeming obedience to her playful command-- "to personate an audience of at least fifty." She unfolded the neatly written sheet, and commenced, in her low musical tones, its perusal; but as she read on, her voice faltered, for touchingly had Gertrude made mention of the lit. tle group from whom she was about to part, of the happy home to which she was returning, of the bright scenes open-   16       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS, ing upon them, and in heart-felt eloquence expressed a hope that each young spirit might go forth trusting in Him who promises Hs love " to them that seek Him early." She asked a place in thememory of her friends, she would not be forgot- ten by those who had entwined themselves with her affections in bright and cherished links, which she trusted never would be severed by the change which ofttimes comes to loving hearts. They must say farewell, but she fondly hoped it would not be for ever; yet, should they meet no more on earth, she prayed that God might claim them when He came to make up His jewels. Carrie had no smile to greet her friend, as she returned the theme; a softer shade of thought was on her fair young face, for she loved the gentle Gertrude, as one who was among them, yet seemed not of them. She thought of her, as one whose nature seemed allied to those bright spirits that dwell in heaven. The noble sacrificing principle of which Gertrude's daily life gave token won her respect and admiration. She loved her with the warmth of an affectionate confiding child, yielding to her gentle guidance, though she could not read the heart's deep workings. -She knew not that Gertrude's child- hood was one of sadness. She had seen a father tenderly be- loved carried to his dreamless rest, a mother whom she idolized reduced almost to penury, yet nobly struggling with affliction 'for her children's sake, and now that circumstances favored them, placing them far above the reach of want, she yet loved' to trust in Him, to whom in hours of darkness and need a mother's hand had pointed her. Gertrude was young, but she had been purified in affliction. She was an humble and de- voted Christian, and the light of her pure spirit was shed on all around, winning to better thoughts thee gay, light-hearted ones who lived but in the present.   CHAPTER III. "Hand clasped within hand, why linger they now I Unclouded by care-is each fair young brow ; Eyes meet loving eyes, can such ever be changed I Heart answers to heart, but shall these be estranged V" "Now, Gertrude, now, Effie, take your revenge,?' said Emma Martin, on a bright summer morning, when the girls were assembled talking over the coming exhibition.   :' Come, girls, admire the scintillations of this bright star, which threatens to eclipse us all." "Yes. girls," returned  Carrie, "do come, Miss   Gilmer awaits the opinions of her learned judges, only throwing her- self upon their mercy. Attention!" and with a comic air she read aloud the rhyme penned for their amusement. "Vale, oh vale, hours of joy, Within these walls I've known, Vale, ye counsels wise and good, Ye bright examples shown. "Here were my young ideas taught The way in which to spbot, Here how to regulate my tongue, And how to place my foot. I've almost learned here to control My thoughts, and words, and looks,   18        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. To eat, and drink, and walk, and talk, By printed rules in books. "I thank ' the Brandon' for her care, rm sure I'l ne'er forget The many kindnesses here shown, To me her chosen pet. "I know she made me fast full oft., ' Precisely as she should, And kept me in on holydays, But then 'twas for my good. "Poor dear ' De Ville,' I pity him, When gentle Carrie's gone, For well I know without her, he Will surely feel alone. "And though our ' Bony ' loves me not, I always take his part, And gladly yield to dear' La Rue' His most capacious heart. "I'll leave, for juniors to admire, My bright and rare example, Of which, dear children, ne'er deny, This vale is a sample." Carrie was applauded by the juniors, with mimic grief and '3   playful caress, to which she responded in her merry strain ; de- positing her masterpiece, as she styled it, in her desk, as a memorial of departed genius, to comfort Mrs. Brandon in her bereavement. It was the day before the much talked of and dreaded ex- hibition, a holyday which seemed more wearisome than did ever one before; for as the time drew near to send them back to friends and homes, they grew still more impatient. They were lingering in little groups of two and three, almost for the last time, in the old school-room; and under whatever circum- stances placed, there is that in the sound of " the last time," which speaks sadly to the gayest heart. Caroline Gilmer, the   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        19 only child of wealthy parents, the flattered and caressed of a large and brilliant coterie, was speaking of her home to her chosen friends. Eulalie Raimond, a beautiful girl of seven- teen, had come among them some years before, an orphan and a stranger. She was of French descent, and had been left to the guardianship of her uncle, a southern planter, who having had occasion to visit New-York, made her of necessity ' the companion of his travels; and being advised to place the little girl at school, gladly left her to the care of Mrs. Bran- don, whose establishment was highly recommended. Other than penning at certain times a formal epistle, they had no intercourse, and under such circumstances, the childish awe with which Miss Raimond regarded her uncle, was little like- ly to be changed to affection, and indeed it was little desired. At first her broken English was a fund of amusement to Car- oline, who was her junior; but as days passed on, and she marked her in their hours of recreation, watch their gayer movements with a mournful gaze, her sympathy was wakened - for the lonely girl, and by many little acts of kindness she won her esteem and confidence, and felt amply repaid when those soft dark eyes were raised to hers beaming with grateful  affection. School-girl friendships ripen not with years; weeks, days, and even hours/suffice to bind young hearts with chains not easily or lightly Iundered, as some scornfully assert. A a short time only had elapsed, when, to use her own expression, Caroline took Eulalie " under her protection."  Her corres- pondence with those at home was made more interesting by the eloquent affection with which she wrote of her friend, and the sympathy for her it elicited. And she won permission from her indulgent parents to invite her to share that home, until claimed by her guardian; and in joyousness of heart, she was forming plans for future pleasure, in which Eulahe was to take a prominent part. ' She urged Gertrude to accompany them, but was obliged to be content with a promise for the future. Gertrude Weston looked on the bright beings by her   20        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. side with strange, deep thoughts, for one whose years scarce'ex- ceeded theirs. They were so blessed with Fortune's fairy gifts--the one rich in affection, surrounded by all that affection could devise for happiness; the other, almost alone on earth, yet possessing gifts of heart and mind, to win for herself friendship and hom- age in the new world to which she was going; both so formed for life and its joys, yet so thoughtless of its sorrows. Ger. trude longed to speak of the insufficiency of earthly good. to bid them beware of the snares and fascinations in its pathways, yet hesitated to dim their parting hours with a shadow of dis- trust, but, as she twined an arm about them, whispered, "May you be very happy, and may our Father keep you so!" "Miss Carleton, had you not better try to comfort Miss Reed?" said Helen Glenn,; with a scornful laugh, as she left the room.                         . Minnie sought sweet Lizzie Reed, a young girl, who had, from childhood, been dependent on Mrs. Brandon's bounty. She could not complain of unkindness-her comfort had been cared for, her mind had not been neglected. But that affection and sympathy, craved by every heart, was denied to her. She - was timid and retiring, seldom mingling with those so much happier, so much beloved. To Minnie Carleton alone were her go; inhmost thoughts revealed; from her alone she sought affection; (:- and now that Minnie was about to leave her. she would be so X desolate! All around seemed happy, with bright hopes for the j future, but she must henceforth gather joy only from the memory of the past. Minnie Carleton was esteemed by her schoolmates as a sin. gular girl. Reserve of manner was often mistaken for the pride I which, in fact, was foreign to her nature; few guessed the depth X of affection that lay hidden beneath that cold demeanor. She S: loved books; to her they were as dear friends! with them she X held sweet intercourse! they gladdened her happy hours, and  softened and subdued her sadness! From infancy she had been  Yi   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.         21 watched with trembling love by her adopted parents, (for she hal never known a dearer care.) During a period of sickness which confined her to her room for weeks, after her return to school, Lizzie Reed's unobtrusive kindness and gentle sympa- thy won her gratitude and love, and they went together on their way, mutually aiding each other in their varied pursuits, and to Lizzie, Minnie's love was a newly risen star of hope, shedding brightness and joy upon her path! "Dear Lizzie," said Minnie, "we shall not be parted long. I hope Mrs. Bran- dn will not refuse my request when it is urged by my mother." And has Mrs. Duncan really written? How kind of her How shall I thank you both?" "By looking less sorrowful than of late, and meeting me with that bright smile upon your lips!" "So here is a letter from aunt Dorothea," said Effie Wal- ton; "and I am to leave to-morrow morning.  Is it not vexa- tious to miss this exhibition, this last grand achievement of ;he house of Brandon! If it were not that dear Charlie is to 'ome for me, I should cry with vexation!" "Better not, Effie; tears are seldom becoming, and I doubt 'dear Charlie' prefers 'les yeux rouge,' 'aux yeux noir.'  ' Ah! if you knew my brother, Carrie Gilmer, you would lot wonder that he was so dear to me.' "' No, particularly when contrasted with that precious aunt. ,f hers," whispered Carrie to Gertrude.  , They say our pretty ]ffie has a dismal time when the old lady's fits are on. She is ontinually upbraiding poor Effie because her mother married ]harles Walton, who was not at the time very able to support er. She considers that act a stain on the family escutcheon, which never can be blotted out. If report says true, it was brough her instrumentality that her sister's name was not )und in her father's will. I suppose it is owing to compunc- ions of conscience. that she permits Effie to have a home there." "Effie has a gay heart; it is a pity that she should be thus ssociated with Miss Clinton."   22        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. "Well, should her malady increase, Effie can desert; she is not, fortunately, altogether dependent on her." The shadows of night stole over earth, and sleep came with them to weary watching eyes, and Mrs. Brandon, after a moral and intellectual address, interspersed with wise caution and friendly wishes, dismissed her pupils with a kind good night.   CHAPTER IV. "She gave her young pure heart to God, Ere it had known earth's wiles; Ere she had heard the tempter's voice, Or seen his luring smiles." "HOME!"Oh what a wealth of music breathes in the word, which finds an echo in every heart! I would wish to look once i more on my home in its beauty, though time has brought change : to all that was dear to me there. Where'er I go, my spirit 7 turns to its far-off shrine, and in my dreams its pictured love- '^ liness flits before me still. i1i "Home, sweet home," are words which never can grow old; and as they had been chanted oft before, joyously, the strain - burst forth, from lips of song, in that old school-room-a fare- -t well from its young, light-hearted inmates! i ;.  The exhibition with its hopes and fears was over-the or- deal was past, and the homage paid to youthful genius and beauty was grateful incense to Mrs. Brandon's heart, and gave a softer tone to her parting words. One group after another passed through the portal, watched anxiously by those who still remained, and amid mingled voices of farewell passed rapidly away, eyes beaming with gladness,  hearts bounding with joy, "Homeward bound." "Good-bye, dear darling Gertrude!" whispered Carrie, re- turning for still another kiss; '"come, come, Eulalie, poor papa /r has been playing the patient long enough!" and, smiling *;.   24       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. through the tears she could not repress, she waved her hand, -one look, and she was gone. Gertrude was left-she was not to leave until the morrow. "How changed!" she murmured, as in the still evening hours she sought the deserted room, which had been wont to echo to merry voices, and grow bright with the light of young'joyous faces. "How desolate it seems," she said, looking out on the blue arch gemmed with myriad stars of beauty. "Yes, but it will be still more sad when you are gone!" said a low sweet voice beside her. "Is it you, Lizzie? I did not know that you were here." "I thought perhaps you would be lonely, and came to seek you. I have often watched you, Miss Weston, when you little thought of me, and treasured many a word which you have long ago forgotten." "And did you really think of and care for me?" questioned Gertrude, drawing her to her. "I did not dream of this!" "Those so much beloved as you have been, scarce note the loneliness of others." ("You should not speak so sadly, Lizzie. True, you are an orphan-a sad lot. I, too, am fatherless; but our Fa ther in heaven has promised to be our guide, our light, our hope, our all!" "Speak on, Gertrude; your words are sweet! I would I could believe them; but if you could read the dark thoughts which war with better feelings, you would know that He could never look in love on one so all unworthy!" "You must not doubt His love. ' As a father pitieth his children, so does your Heavenly Father pity' you; and, if you will but trust in Him, come to Him confidingly, He will re- ceive you as His own!" Hours passed on, and still they talked unweariedly; the one all eloquent to plead the love which she had won, essayed to pour its balm upon the troubled spirit. Midnight found them waking still; but, side by side, they knelt in prayer, and -   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.         25 sought the teaching of the Holy Spirit. Gertrude bent above her sleeping friend, ere she sought repose, and gently kissed her cheek, breathing a blessing and a prayer for her, upon whose brow seemed written peace and joy. A bright smile lingered on her lips; her hands were folded as though she still held commune with her Maker, and Gertrude left her with deep and holy joy, rejoicing that the weary timid dove had found a shelter and rest. "God bless you, Lizzie!:' was her parting salutation, as the weeping girl held her in a lingering embrace. "Oh write to me sometimes, Gertrude; give me your coun- sel still!" "I will write; be of good cheer, you have many friends, and One who is above all others." Thus it is in-life: we form new ties but to see them sev- ered, and the heart turns to the past fQr memories to cheer, to soothe, and bless us! ?' - 31   CHAPTER V. ,I Some seats, alas! are void, or filled not now as they have been, Ere death the magic circle broke, in days that we have seen; We know not what may be our lot, ere past the next year rolls. But come; we've lived through many a grief, so peace be with their souls: In silence to their memories, we'll pour one grateful tear, While hailing happy Christmas, and we hope a happy year." CHRISTMAS; with its thousand thrilling associations, its sad and joyful memories; its social gatherings and reunions of home; dawned brightly on the earth, bringing to many joyous hearts "much to remembr and naught to regret." In the fair town of Hempstead might be seen, from early morn until dusk, groups of young and old passing to and fro, with pleasant faces, exchanging smiling greetings, and care seemed to outward view banished alike from hearts and dwell- ings: joy reigned upon that glad day. In a retired but picturesque part of the town, a group of happy children were wending their way towards a dwelling re- markable for its neat and elegant exterior. There were traces of flowers that bloomed in summer weather,' and within the parted curtains the passers-by caught a glimpse of a stand fill- ed with bright exotics, nurslings of some fair hand. A bright and cheerful fire was blazing there, meet welcome for every coming guest, and vases of fresh flowers, books, and music, seen here and there within the room, gave token of refined and cultivated taste in its inmates. The bright sunbeams glanced in, adding fresh joyousness to the home-scene. A fairy girl of   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        27 some seven summers examined with childish delight the con- tents of a Christmas tree, in the arrangement of which her wishes had evidently been consultef. "Dear mamma,". she exclaimed, clapping her hands, " here is the very book I wanted, the very one I Now that was sister Gertrude, I know; I must go and kiss her this very moment!" and away she went to seek her. Mrs. Weston (for she it was, the idol of these her only children, their all of earth to cling to) drew her chair closer to the fire, and gazed musingly upon the glowing embers as though she read there records of the past. But she mused not long, for Gertrude herself entered, followed by the children to whom we before alluded. They came with their simple offering of misletoe garlands interwoven with the scarlet berries of the holly. These were her own especial protegees, children of po- verty, whose lives she strove to brighten, and who regarded :; her as some superior being, almost of a brighter sphere. She brought them to her mother, for well she knew her gentle greeting would be dear to each, and the little/gifts she had prepared for them were presented by her sister. And thus by a few words kindly spoken, a trifling token, telling of re- -  membrance, she made glad the children of the destitute, and brought a sunbeam of joy to their humble homes. And many a mother's heart blessed the young Gertrude on that day, as passing from the village church (where the rich and poor wor- P:?I shipped together), she greeted them with a bright smile and /-21 tender inquiry for those dear to them. Evening, with its gathering shadows, found her by her a  mother's side, with the little Lucy nestled at their feet, and as the twilight deepened they talked of by-gone hours, of the missing ones who were wont to meet them at that hour, and turn- ing from the past they looked upon the future; and the daugh- ters treasured the mother's gentle counsel in long after years. An hour passed on, but they were no longer alone. The 1  aged minister, whom  Gertrude had known and loved from   28        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. childhood, joined them, and he was ever a welcome guest. As the evening wore on, friend after friend joined the social group, and with cheerful converse and glad music from the. young and joyous, the hours glided swiftly away. The pastor lingered as though he could not turn from cheer- ful faces to his lonely home, and perchance, as he gazed on Gertrude's loving face, he thought of the fair child gone to rest, the pride and comfort of his old age; and perchance it was for the sake of her who had gone to dwell among the angels, he blessed her yet more fervently. "You must not desert mamma, but come more frequently when I am gone, Mr. Stanton," said Gertrude, as she gave him her hand at parting. "And so you go next week; well, I trust you may be hap- py; let not the gay scenes in which you are about to mingle teach you to forget the source of all true happiness; and Ger- trude, my child, if at some future time you should be tempted to lean too much on earthly love, should earthly joys allure, remember the old man told you, ' Set not your affections on them, they attract and then deceive, and when you think to grasp the flowers, thorns unseen may pierce and wound.' Bless you, my child," and passing his hand caressingly over the bright hair which was put back from her forehead, he bent and 'left a kiss of kindness there.' It was a simple act, as from a father to a child, but she looked wonderingly at the old man, for never since her childhood had he parted with her thus. She returned his gentle counsel with grateful thanks, then sought her mother ere she too retired. "Do not send me from you, mamma," she urged; " it is selfish to wish to leave you, let me stay." C"No, my daughter, I wish you to go; you are young, and to such, life has many charms; you must not disappoint Miss Gilmer, it is not meet return for her kindness. Good night, my child," and as she kissed her, Gertrude thought she had never looked so lovely, yet so fragile.   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.       29 Good night! these are simple words, yet how sadly do they re-echo when those we love have said good night for ever. "Good night!"We should never breathe them with an unkind thought or feeling, for they are at once a blessing and a prayer, and when we give them utterance we should be at peace with all the world. -1   CHAPTER VI. u' Why did the fearful angel his death-winged arrow send? For the poor man found in thee relief, the suffering a friend; Thy heart was ever open, and thy voice was ever kind, Speaking a soul alive to love, and at peace with all mankind." "Tread lightly in the house of grief To which thy steps are led, And view with calmness, if thou canst, The features of the dead!" "MAMMA! mamma!" said the weeping Lucy Weston, "Mary is here from the parsonage, and she says our dear Mr. Stanton is dead.   Oh, it can't be true," and she clasped her arms around her mother's neck, and sobbed convulsively. C"Yes, dear mamma, it is too true," said Gertrude, meeting her inquiring gaze, the bright tears glistening in her eyes; and they wept to think that one so much endeared had left them suddenly for ever. It was, as Gertrude said, too true.   The old and faithful domestic, who had been with him from the time of his marriage, had herself brought the sad intelligence. "He came home last night, Miss Gertrude," she said, " and bidding me good night, as usual, went to his room. I passed his door on my way up stairs, and stopped to ask him if he wanted any thing. He had been reading; but he looked up so kind and gentle-like, and said: ' No, thank you, my good Mary, nothing.'"  And   the poor woman wept aloud in her despair., for to her he had been as a beacon-star of truth and light.   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.         31 As his life had glided peacefully along, so gently it fled from him, and none, save the Unseen, knew when the spirit passed, or how. When, at the hour for morning prayer, his place was still vacant, they went to seek him; but the totter- ing form was motionless and still, the sleep was all too deep for life, and the stricken group went forth to tell to those who loved him, "that he was not, for God hath taken him."  Many a tear was shed for him by old and young, by high and low, for to all he had been a friend, a guide, a blessing. The quiet parsonage was filled with mournful groups, and ever and anon   some hand would leave a last token on the bier, the bright : but fragile blossoms of the earth. The little children left their I  play and hushed their merriment, to pass and repass the door that had never been closed to them, and marvelled that he laid so still and cold, unheeding all their tears. Mrs. Weston sought poor Mary, and strove to comfort her; -  but as she stood beside him, and gazed upon those placid fea- tures, she thought of those who had gone before, and asked her :  own heart if it were well to weep that he was free from earth, s  blest for evermore. Sadly and solemnly tolled the Sabbath bell, as, followed by  a sorrowing band, they bore the old man to the church, where lj his presence had ever seemed as a gleam of light to weary and :  benighted souls.  A minister from a neighboring town, who had known and revered him, arose in his wonted place to speak,- :  to speak of him who might never stand there more.  He read /  from a portion of Holy Writ the thrilling words: "Blessed   are the dead which die in the Lord, from   henceforth: yea, , saith the Spirit, that they may rest from  their labors, and :: their works do follow them!" H4i'i  He spoke, in touching terms, of him so suddenly called :  from them, of his meek and  lowly life, his precept and exam- ple, and urged them to treasure his counsels, and walk by them   in the way his feet had trod, that they might, after life's short days were told, win the rest of that sainted one,   32        SUNB AMS AND SHADOWS. "Who had gone in Joy before them To realms of glory blest, Where the wicked cease from troubling, And the weary are at rest." They laid him in the old church-yard, by those whom he had followed there long since, and silently and sadly turned away, and left him to his rest. It was near sunset, when Gertrude, the evening before her departure, left the house to visit the good min's grave, and as she bent above the sleeping dust, thoughts of other days came o'er her with strange power, moving her even to tears. She remembered his parting words, but she might never hear that voice again; his parting kiss, but now, those lips were sealed for ever, and there, in that winter's eve, she re- called his counsel, and resolved that it should ever be with her as the whisper of a guardian angel on life's changeful way. A low mournful sound near made her start and trem- ble. it Oh, is it only you, my poor Fido," she said, recog- nizing the little dog, which had been his constant companion in life, and was now the lonely watcher by his grave. Strok- ing him fondly, she lured him from the spot, and took him to his old home again, but he would not stay; and days after, as the children passed, they found him still beside the grave, the food that had been brought, untouched. He, too, had been " faithful unto death." *   CHAPTER VII. (4 The moonlight's gleaming on the gentle streams Its silver sheen is dancing on the shore; And I once more seem standing by that hearth, :       The holy spot, as I have done of yore. My childhood's home,-the scene of joy and mirth, Where one now revels in her childish glee; Yet, mother! can I think of none but thee."' "- THE mails have surely failed, or all is not well with you, dear Mamma,"   (wrote Gertrude Weston.)   4"I have been much rallied to-day, for my sadness, and I acknowledge that I have not yet acquired the faculty of concealing either joy or grief. But I will strive to win brighter thoughts, remem- bering that an eye is watching o'er you that is never sealed in sleep; that an arm of love encircles all whom I love on the earth. I will adopt ' Hope  for my motto, and believe that to-morrow may bring balm for disappointment in the form of a letter from you. I trust you will ere long call me back, for do you know I am  presumptuous enough to think, or at least to hope, that you cannot spare me for a much longer period; it not that I am  weary of those around me-not that I deem to  them weary of me, but I long to be with you; my ear is ever listening for a sound that comes not nigh, the music of my mother's voice; and my eye seeks in vain the glance so beam- ing with affection. "Mr. Gilmer would laugh, and call me sentimental, perhaps vZ.   34       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS, an enthusiast, were he to read this paragraph; not so his gen. tle wife; she would respond to every feeling, for she would feel them to be true. She is very lovely; I' would that you could know her. Her affections cling to earth, and seem centred in her husband and her child; and when I look at Carrie, I can scarce wonder that it is so. She fulfils the promise of her childhood. It is not that her features are' faultless, far from it; but there is an animation, a fascination in her bright face, which few attempt to resist,'and the changeful lustre of her speaking eye forms a theme for many a sonnet from Eulalie. "I believe when I write to you- there is so much to say of little I, that I seldom mention her, and now I think of it, I wonder at myself. Hers is the beauty of the mind; hers the gift of song. Many bow at the shrine of genius and feeling, but he who wins the gem, must be worthy to wear it. When I look at her it is with an indescribable feeling. half of sad- ness. She is so loving, so confiding, and withal so sensitive; a look or tone, that others scarce would note, has power to cast a shadow on her heart. I tremble for her even while I own the spell which binds our hearts to love her. Uncle Jacob (for he insists on my so styling him) watches over her as though she were his all on earth. She can guide the,.old man at her will. '"I was indeed surprised, Mamma, to learn that Mr. Dun- can has succeeded our dear pastor. He seems almost an acquaintance, I heard Minnie Carleton speak so frequently of his merits. She, you know, is the adopted child of his parents. Do you think it likely that he will be acceptable to his charge? "I am scribbling on, forgetting time and space; it is to one, however, who will scarcely chide me. Carrie is growing impatient. I have promised to accompany them this evening to Mrs. Leslie's.

Twas a night of mirth, and the young were there With hearts as light as the summer air, And the unblanched cheek, and the undimmed eye Blended well with the music's melody." "Bright jewels bound her raven hair, And sparkled on her hand; For earth has naught of rich, or rare, Her wealth might not command. No brighter, lovelier face appears In pleasure's crowded mart; That proud eye was not meant for tears, No blight should reach that heart. Yet mournful is the strain she Sings, As fall of autumn leaves, As tremblingly she sweeps the strings, And lays of sadness weaves." " DEAREST Gertrude, you look charmingly," said Caroline Gilmer, as she left her toilet to superintend those of her friends, " but let me place this pearl bandeau above that fore- head fair," she continued playfullya and then          I shall have no fault to find." " No, no, Carrie, no pearls for me, reserve them for your- self; this rose contents me well." "You are a real little Puritan," returned the gay girl, " but I will not waste time on you, I shall succeed better with Eulalie;;" and they went to seek one scarce more fair, yet strangely different. "Ma chere amie !" (was Carrie's ejaculation of surprise on    --          SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        37 entering Miss Raimond's chamber,) "are you reading still 2 just where I left you, the identical page too, and upside down at that. Ah, Eulalie, you have been studying a different book, if I mistake not, scanning the lore of living hearts; nay, you need not blush, there is no great harm in it. We will be mer- ciful and allow you one half hour more to meet us, and then let me find that book open at your peril. Come, Gertrude, come, ' La belle ' needs not your assistance." "It is well for her, Miss Carrie, that ' La bonne' is still retained in some vocabularies ; but go, both of you; banishment a: from this charmed room will be punishment enough." - Such vanity I would you have believed it, Gertrude? But I shall immediately report her to the higher powers!" Well might a mother's proud glance meet her, and a mother's eye rest fondly on her, as she entered the room, her arm linked within her friend's. The rose-tint on her cheek added new lustre to the eye so darkly blue, and the smiling lip, and joyous tone gave token of a, heart yet free from sorrow. "Shall we do, Mamma?" questioned Carrie, as she met her mother's gaze, and bent to kiss the- cheek, which time had not robbed of its beauty. Her answer was a bright smile, as putting back the soft curls that clustered round her daughter's brow, she said, "These wilful ringlets, dearest, ought to be imprisoned." "'No, no, let them be free, free as I; I love not fetters, light or gay, whether the links be of gold or silk; for heart or brow, let both be free." "Ah! Cariie, my little Gertrude will bear the palm from you to-night, with her Madonna-like beauty," whispered Mr. Gilmer. "Now, Papa, you know you do not believe that, so I shall not listen to you; but here comes Eulalie, who must surpass us both. Come, loiterer, Uncle Jacob is impatient to criticise you; he looks severely indignant that you should keep him waiting so long."    7 ^ - '   ,  *^ r 3SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. -( Caroline, child, you talk too fast sometimes. Do not mind her, Eulie; come sit beside me,"-and he took her little hand caressingly in his, gazing with childlike admiration on her jewelled fingers, and she, as ever, did his bidding; and a strange contrast they formed, the silvery-haired man, and she, in all her youthful beauty robed for the festival. "Uncle Jacob, you must pay your vows quickly, and take a last, long, lingering look; I fear we shall hardly persuade Eulalie to return early. Did you hear that Ellerton Leslie had returned? Papa," she said, glancing archly at Eulalie, "he has brought a friend with him. I wonder if he too posseses the ' gift eloquent.?" "Come, come, prattler, it is time to go; but how shall I ever succeed in muffling you all? It is cold, very cold," said Mr. Gilmer, with a countenance of mimic distress. "With whom shall I commence?" "Oh! you need not be alarmed, Papa, I do not wish to be made a mummy of, and Uncle Jacob is prepared to encase Eulie, so there is only Gertrude on whom to exercise your talent." "Oh, she is not so unmanageable as you, my lady fair, so I shall be her attendant this evening." "Shall we pity you, or envy, Gertrude?" she responded, laughingly; then as she took her place in the carriage, kissing her hand playfully, said "Good night, Uncle Jacob; Eulalie recommends for your perusal the fascinating volume she has been studying all day." The sound of many voices fell on Gertrude's ear as she entered the brilliantly lighted apartments of Mrs. Leslie, one of the few amid the gay circle around her whom she had learned to love. She half withdrew -her aarm from Mr. Gil- mer's as she saw the numerous groups here assembled, but it was too late to retreat, and returning the courteous greeting of their hostess, they mingled with the crowd. Mrs. Leshe was the widow of an officer, who had left her   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.         39 in the service of his country, and while she was cherishing  fond hopes of his early return, the voice of desolation was i heard in her dwelling, and she mourned as one without hope for him that died far away, and left no parting token. They left him to his rest, in a strange land, with " the stars that know no country, lone watchers o'er his grave.." A son and daughter were the only ties to bind her still to earth, and yet another tie was rudely to be sundered. The lovely girl whom she had guarded with such tender care, the bud of beauty ^ which gave promise of such bright blossoming, passed to the i home where spirits dwell, and then indeed she was bereft. She met Gertrude at Mrs. Gilmer's during a morning call, and a real or fancied resemblance to her lost child, made her heart ;:i yearn toward the young stranger, and she sought her often; , and as time passed, she became dear to the lonely mother's  heart as a voice that spoke of other days. :j  Ellerton Leslie, her only son, the pride of her widowed :i heart, had just returned from a southern tour, and it was to - welcome his coming that so many were gathered in his early : home. In the recess of a window, half concealed by the heavy cur- tains, stood Ellerton Leslie, in earnest converse with Gertrude : Weston. He had marked her entrance with deep emotion, for ; she seemed almost as one risen from the tomb; the companion A and idol of his boyhood seemed to pass before him.  He lin- ;ij gered near her, and as her low sweet voice made answer to his : broken words, he could scarce control his feelings, and thus he ;j stood, forgetting all around save her who listened wonderingly. ^-:j Yet there was one amid the throng who gazed on them with ":i sadder thoughts than was meet for such an hour. Eulalie, the v star of every festival, the centre of an admiring group, with the : smile upon her lip which " brought no message from the heart, / answered gay words with others seemingly as glad, but ever - and anon the bright eye wandered to those forgetting, yet not : unforgot. She was in his home, at his mother's bidding, where   40        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. he had ever been first to greet her; but now her coming wt unnoted, her presence all unheeded. He had never spok( words save those of friendship, but it needs not such to res the heart. She had dreamed in happiness of heart-but no the waking was dark and sad. Now that she had looked fo ward to his coming more hopefully than she wished to own, sl had been passed by as a stranger, and deep, proud feelings hE their sway, and, as many have oft done before, Eulalie Rs mond silently resolved that never, by word or look of hei should Ellerton Leslie know she cared aught for the change and her smile grew brighter, and her voice thrilled more jo ously, and Carrie Gilmer looked wonderingly on her gent friend, and feared it was but seeming. They pleaded for a son and though Carrie urged her not to heed them, she suffer, them to lead her away. A low, sweet, prelude rose, then died away, and tremblin ly, at first, her voice thrilled the hearts of those around, hushii the laugh and jest. Gertrude, with Ellerton, joined the circ clustering around her. As she sang, the memory of other da came o'er him, and shadows swept across his heart, moving hi almost to tears. The song ceased, ad they pleaded for a other, then a change came o'er the Spirit's mood; with a fix hand she swept the strings, and those who heard her then, fi got not soon the touching strain! Smiles, for the present and the past; Tears are not for the gay; When shadows come near youthful hearts, Oh let them not have sway I Let not the beaming eye grow dim, Or the young spirit sad I Though friendship's vows be fleeting As bright dreams we have had I Smile! if thy heart be breaking Let not its page be read; 3i   *-i ' SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.          41 Sing strains of joy and gladness, Though sunshine all be fled I Let lip and eye, and heart and brow, Be schooled to act their part, Let worldly lips praise wonderingly,- What know they of the heart I She turned away, but no one sought to stay her; no song was heard from other lips, but there was one beside her with words of praise, that died away as he met that cold glance from ! eyes that ne'er before so calmly met his own. Again she was : surrounded; and to those she cared not for she listened with f seeming eagerness; and sadly Ellerton turned to other guests, ; in his inmost heart repeating " false as fair;" yet his thoughts were with her still, and when the parting came, he went as was ? his wont to breathe a kind " good night!" and she, could she - do aught but answer gently then? The dove of peace seemed ; to hover above the troubled hearts and soften memories that ; might have been sad, even to bitterness I   ' " '-s . ; e   CHAPTER IX. Lady! we met, and soon we must be parted; My spirit sad, and thou, scarce more light-hearted! "I've not been long away, mother I few suns have rose and set Since last ihe tear-drop on thy cheek, my lips in kisses met! 'Tis but a little while I know, but very long it seems, Though every night I came to thee, dear mother, in my dreams!" DAYS and weeks passed- on, yet Gertrude's stay was still prolonged; she had yielded to the entreaties of her friends until she could delay no longer-she pined for home! The evening before that fixed for her departure, were assembled at Mr. Gilmer's a few friends, cheerful, yet not gay, for she had become dear to many, and the thought of separation subdued each tone of mirth. There was one who lingered near her watching her every movement; whose voice was seldom heard, yet who felt none the less deeply. Mr. Selden, the friend of Ellerton Leslie, had met in his southern home no fairer flower than that which bloomed 'neath a colder sky. His rare intellectual endowments, giving promise of emi- nence in his profession, though so lately admitted to the bar- the wealth at his command, his gifts, which laid on any shrine would scarce be lightly held-these now seemed all of no avail. Eloquently though he might press his suit, and with the fascination of commanding genius plead his cause, it would not win the prize which he so coveted. Gertrude owned the power of his thrilling words, but might not yield to their spell. The gathered lore of years: or gems of beauty brought from   'i SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        43 olden mines of thought, were valueless. If the spirit God had given to be purified for heaven was darkly chained to earth, and looked not to brighter hopes beyond, she dared not hold communion with it. And thus it was with him. She sorrowed for the gifts of heart, and mind perverted, meet offerings on a higher shrine. She turned from the earnest pleading of one so noble, yet so far from truth, but still proffired friendship, and gently urged him to win " the pearl of price"-'to seek the love and favor of Him whose very existence he refused to acknow- ledge. Good nights and farewells were interchanged, and kind wishes breathed for the parting guest, but Edward Selden lin- gered still. Eulalie sang, and Ellerton Leslie bending o'er her joined in the strain, while Uncle Jacob looked on moodily, wondering why Eulalie sang and walked and talked so much with Leslie. "It was very strange," he muttered, " very strange." : "Farewell, Miss Weston, since it must be so; I would not ! be forgotten; think of me even in your happiest hours," said Selden. "God bless you, Mr. Selden.  I never forget my friends," said Gertrude, softly. And thus they parted. But long after, the words so often heard from Gertrude's lips came echoing with strange power, subduing at times his wayward heart. Gertrude thought of him full oft even hopefully, trusting that he would yet know and yield to the influence of the Holy Spirit. The long hours passed by, and the young girls still kept A vigil, there was so much to say, so much was still unspoken. - They talked of the future, of the bright prospects opening to  one: and as Eulalie heard them speak of one so dear to her :i (one who ere long would claim her as his own), with blended : words of praise and hope for future happiness, she leaned her :; head upon her hands, and the warm tears fell unheeded; yet -! they were of joy, not of sorrow. :M          *             X,8   "       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. "My dear girls waking still," said Mrs. Gilmer dooking in on them at a late hour); this should not be; I must play the tyrant, and send you all to bed." "I shall immediately obey, Mamma," interposed Carrie, Cc or else no chance for sleep to-night; what with Eulalie, who is fiancee, discoursing of the absent, and Gertrude, who is not, musing on the exile, and poor I, who am neither, winking and blinking mightily, and wondering, like Uncle Jacob, to what it all tends, thinking it passing strange. Good night, dear Ger- trude," she said, kissing her fondly (while the tears glistening in her eyes contradicted her own gay words), "you know I patronize the comic muse, for tragedy is foreign to my nature." "I trust you may ever be as free from care, Carrie," she said, returning her caress. The fire blazed brightly on the hearth, the lamps were lit, and anxious faces turned ever and anon towards the door, as the hour drew near which would bring the long absent to her home. "That carriage surely stopped, Mamma," said Lucy Wes- ton; and "dear sister," ' Gertrude, my child," were the mingled greetings, as Gertrude Weston was folded in their fond embrace, and listened to a mother's tender inquiries, and met her gentle glance; then joyed to feel she was at home once more.   "Perchance the grave is green Of those you hold so dear. Come where their love hath been, Their spirits linger near. Come to the sacred mound, 'Twill raise the heart, in love To the better home they've found  With the true and pure above." WEEKs and months passed swiftly on, as time does to the hap- py, and the bright spring flowers were blooming around Ger- trude's home, and some that used to blossom beauteously at the old parsonage had been brought to share her care; mute yet sacred remembrances of the good, the loved, and lost. Above the old pastor's grave she was training a vine that he had planted, and the young messenger of truth (who came to fill his place) would often visit it with her, in the still sunset hour, andhear her speak of the meek arid lowly-hearted laid to rest, and how fondly he was endeared to old and young; and his , purposes gained  strength, and his heart seemed to grow more pure as he looked towards the veil that parted the unseen from an earthly vision, remembering that for the faithful was re- served a crown of light and glory in the presence of Him who comforteth his people, promising to be with them always even iunto the end of the world. 5 ::'              ^K ^?^^   "       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.           - Mr. Duncan had a winning way with him, old Mary said, and she watched and cared for him as tenderly as though he had been known for years. The heart cannot be sad for ever;  it clings to earth and earthly ties, and when these are severed, though their memories are sacred still and fondly treasured, yet the warm affections may not be buried with them, but, seeking for sympathy, find other objects upon which to lean  and other love to bless.   ! Mr. Duncan had become a frequent visitor at Mrs. Wes-  ton's, where Lucy's welcome ever .awaited him. She hadever some question to ask, some little work in which he was sure to be interested; and Mrs Weston looked kindly on the young stranger, now absent from his home and thought how hard  must be the mother's trial thus to yield him up; but when she  remembered his high calling, his glorious mission, her heart, replied, "Shallwe not give to our Father's service the gifts His love hath lent 2"And her sympathy was his whene'er 'twas  needed, and she blessed him ever. "I have received a letter from home, Miss Weston, and as it  contains a message for you, I have ventured to intrude again,' - said Mr. Duncan, one bright evening, entering the sitting- oom Gertrude had been reading aloud, butas she laid aside  hoerbook, and rose to receive him, her smile seemed not such as would have greeted an intruder. tIt is from my sister, that is, Minniell he explained, i' the first time she has writ- ; ten since I left home.

In my last interview with her, some few words of mine, some remembered counsel of my mother; she deemed of service to her, placing on them an un- due value. Through the medium of correspondence, I have become more intimately acquainted mith, and learned to love her. Her loneliness is a claim for sympathy difficult to resist, and were she associated with those who understood her character, she might be moulded to the will, a being of rare mental loveliness." "Minnie seems much attached to her. Mrs. Brandon, how- ever, permits only a short visit, which for her sake I regret. She mingles so little in society, and even in the home circle often withdraws from our pursuits and enjoyments, and we sometimes fear she is unhappy." "Who shall look into the heart, or fathom its depths?" re- turned Gertrude. "It hath well springs of happiness known only to ourselves, and our Creator, who made us to differ. There are few who drink of the same cup, or look on joy alike; then, is it not wrong to think there is no sunshine where we only see the shade?" A few days only had elapsed, when Mr. Duncan received a startling summons, bidding him return to his home, if he would look upon his brother yet alive. He had been thrown from his horse, and received an injury which his physicians feared would terminate fatally. The sufferer asked constantly for him, and his father urged him to speed on his way. He went to say farewell to Mrs. Weston, and leaving a message for Gertrude, went on his sad mission, followed by the childish sympathy of Lucy, and the earnest prayers of Mrs. Weston, that the stroke might yet be averted, and the glad home not left desolate.   CHAPTER XI. 4 Not yet; the flowers are on my path, the sun is in my sky.

"The danger is past, my brother.

"But, Henry, earth's joys are fleeting and of little wortl   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.       49 compared with heaven's glories; earthly affection is weak when we remember the great and changeless love which has redeem- ed us; and often in our blindness we forget ' the Giver of all good,' in devotion to the gifts He sends; and then it is our Father chastens us, to bring us to that fold from whence our hearts are prone to wander."          J "It is even so, Walter; I have too often wandered from 'Him; would that my heart were pure and good as yours. I, who thought my soul prepared to pass with all its earthly stains into the presence of Imy  Maker, now feel how all un- worthy I have been to call upon His name. It is His mercy which preserves me, to bring me to a knowledge of myself. Oh, how shall I ever sufiiciently love and adore him?" and he threw himself back upon the pillows exhausted by the intensi- ty of the feelings thus awakened.    "Walter!" he murmured, after a few moments, " pray with -: me; say the prayer our mother taught us, even as in our child- :  hood ;" and it was a touching thing to see them thus: the one in the pride and strength of health, bowing beside his younger aft brother, asking for him the peace which cometh from above. Minnie Carlton paused upon the threshold as she heard :- those thrilling tones. And when his orison was ended, he -  seated himself beside his brother, clasping his fevered hands :: and soothing him to rest, as though he were a child again, with promises from holy writ: "'Let not your heart lSe -' troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me.: 'Let not :  your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid,' said our bless- jt ed Saviour to: his weeping followers. It speaks to us even now, in the hour of darkness, as in their time of sorrow. 'Peace I i leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world i :: giveth give I unto you.' That boon, which was promised them, dear Henry, will be given now: for He who died to save, loves still; He still lives to be our Intercessor, our Saviour, and our God." Walter knew not then that one was near him, drinking in   50        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. the music of his voice, half murmuring the blessed words, yearning for their answer to her own troubled spirit, "' Not as the world gives.' "Oh!" thought Minnie, " would that peace were mine; would that it could still the warfare in my heart. ! HE thinks not of me; he, so noble, and so pure; and Hoh, i well may I tremble at the wild hope I dared to cherish." Noiselessly she retraced her steps, and sought the silence of her chamber, there to look into the past and weep for the present, now come to crush its beauty; but ever and anon, in the dark- ness of that hour, a soft-voice seemed to whisper "Peace." and she strove to look above and raise her thoughts in prayer. Minnie had gathered some of the fragrant jasmine Henry loved, intending to place them on his pillow; but she forgot her mission, and when Walter left the room he found them scattered on the ground, and picking up one of the fragile sprays, he sought the room where the family had assembled for the evening meal, and placed it in his mother's hair, telling her i it was an emblem of herself, as pure and fair. "It will be a more fitting type, my child, an hour from this: when the leaves droop and the flowers begin to wither." "But they will bloom again, mother dear." "Not these, Walter," she replied, half mournfully; " but you had better give them to Lizzie, or Minnie." "Oh, there are enough for all," he said, " but I would give them other blossoms from our garden walks." "What should you select for me?" said Lizzie Reed. "Do you know I love to talk in flowers; their language is mute, 'tis true, but how eloquent; they have voices, which speak not to the ear but to the heart."                . " Were I to speak through them my wish. I would proffer the ivy-friendship's magic name. Were they to speak of you, I would weave a garland of the blue periwinkle, for it would truly tell of ' sweet remembrances;' but one entirely typical of  you, it would puzzle me to choose."  "In gratitude for those mentioned, she will forgive the 1   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        51 is? omission," said Mr. Duncan; " but come, you have not chosen for Minnie." "Thank you, but I do not wish any; I had rather you would not select for me," said Minnie, hastily; and then, as looks of surprise were turned towards her, she added with a faint smile, "I am a little superstitious, you know; perhaps I :-. might be tempted to link my destiny with the flower, and that would quickly fade or die; so you had better pass me by." "Nonsense; where did you learn such notions  Now a ;: flower you shall have, if lam to seek it;" persisted Mr. Dun- ;' can. But Walter noted the changing cheek and quivering lip, and sympathizing ever, pitied the emotion he did not compre- i;'; hend, proposed to his father returning to Henry's room, thus recalling to their minds the object of their deep interest and late anxiety. He watched by his brother until midnight, when finding he still slept quietly, resigned his place to the nurse, and was go- i  ing to his room to seek repose, but was surprised to see the -  glimmering of a light which seemed to proceed from Minnie's :! chamber. :" His first impulse was to send his mother to ascertain if she were ill; but remembering how wearied she was with watching and care, he aroused a domestic. To her inquiry he heard Minnie reply, (I Can it be so late? I had no idea of the hour. You may go, I do not need you."  "' She is a strange' girl," soliloquized Walter; ('I will talk 1 to her to-morrow; but I do not believe I shall ever understand her." And so thought many; and some learned to look beneath i  the cold exterior; but not until life's sun had set, resolved I Minnie Carlton, should Walter ever know the cloud upon her - pathway.

I ask-think on me when you pray. TO-MORROW came and passed, yet Walter spoke not to Minnie of herself. Without seeming to avoid him, she never lingered in his presence; her manner was kind and courteous, her greet- ing ever the same, but how longf the days seemed to her none knew; none dreamed how earnestly she longed for him to go, that she might strive to calm her heart, and forget her suffering in administering to the happiness of others. From henceforth she resolved that self should be disregarded. To care for those he loved should be her first duty, and surely she thought that must win the reward she sought, and bring calm and peace to the wounded spirit. Henry was enabled, with assistance, to leave his room, but still so weak as to be the object of much solicitude, and all vied in their efforts to cheer and amuse hii-. He was very fond of reading, but he could not thus amuse himself for any length of time, so Lizzie Reed's patience was taxed. For hours together she would sit beside him and read page after page of the old legends he loved to hear, and day after day continued her employment with untiring gentleness. It made hint happy, so Lizzie was contented. "You are getting on bravely, Henry," said Walter, on one   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        53 of these occasions. c I must think of my return; I ought to be at my post on next Sabbath; it will not answer for me to be too long away." "How I dislike that word ' Farewell ;' I wish that it could be blotted from our language and our life)" said Henry, petu- lantly. :   "That it may not be till- time be lost in eternity. There is but one home where farewells are heard not, a home far from hence."     "True, Walter," said his father; " so we must act heroic- ally, and have at least the merit of resignation. You are right, my boy ; duty is the safer path, though sometimes rugged. -: It will be hard to give you up; but we must look forward to ;  the time that shall bring you home again to brighten this parting." ( Minnie," said Walter) the night before his departure, " my :I bsister, what has come over you of late? you are strangely alter- ed;" and he gently detained her as she was turning away. ;: "HHave I ever, by word or deed, grieved or offended you? if so, I pray you tell me; it makes me very sad to see you thus." He paused for an answer, but none came; no token-that his   words were heard, save a deeper flush upon her cheek, toling -a  of the inward struggle. Walter sighed, but continued: C"There -o must be some cause, some change, perhaps some sorrow. You ?i  are not happy. My mother, it is needless to say how dear your ?:  welfare is to her; and my father, perhaps," he said, more cheer- ';, fully, " perhaps, were we inclined, we might find pretext for ^  jealousy of his affection. For Henry and myself, I may say, !- that from boyhood, when you came to us in your helplessness, 7id we looked on you as our especial care, our plaything, and our ::! pet; but in our riper years, our treasured companion, our only ? ; and dear sister; and must the trouble which weighs upon your a  heart be shrouded from us all, we who would sympathize with "' your lightest care, who would fain soothe every sorrow?"-and tj he would have drawn her to him even as it had been his wont Of X   .     '54       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. in earlier days. but she shrank from his caressing hold, and left - the room, the warm tears gushing from their fount to ease the aching heart. She came not back; but when Walter retired that night, he i found on his table a little note in her own familiar writing. He opened it, and eagerly scanned its contents, hoping it might solve the mystery. ' Walter," it said, a dear Walter, think me not unkind, un- feeling-for so indeed I must have seemed to you. My heart is full of gratitude for the past, for the loving care of those  around-me. Do not think me unhappy. If, at times, a cloud dims life's sunlight, what matters it? such, soon or late, must come to all; but the bright beams disperse the gloom at last: the darkness does not stay for ever. I shall remember your words of kindness, and your gentle forbearance will aid me in seeking the path of duty. Do not question me now; trust in - me still. Time perhaps may prove me all that you would,have ! me, all that I could wish to be. "Think of me in your prayers, Walter, as once you did; mine are weak, and seem of no avail." And this was their parting; they little knew what changes were in store ere they again exchanged a greeting of farewell. *           fil   CHAPTER XIII.

SHARON was much resorted to that summer, and many parties from other watering places found there blended beauty and novelty, and on the whole it was the resort of the season. It was towards the close of a sultry afternoon in July, that the attention of the pleasure-seekers was attracted by an elderly lady who was pacing majestically the long piazza, but whose frowning brow and compressed lips betokened no very pleasant greeting to the bright, happy-looking little fairy who smilingly obeyed her august summons; though she was apparently well contented with the companion she left, who walked slowly away, while she summoned up courage to meet the lady's scru- tinizing glance. ;; Miss Walton," she commenced, in a severe tone, "Miss Walton, (for it was our old friend Effie thus addressed,) when will you learn prudence, when acquire a due sense of the dignity of your position? Did I not positively forbid your forming an acquaintance here; and yet I find this is not the first time you have disobeyed me. What have you to say for yourself?" "Nothing, ma'am," said Effie, demurely i; making her bon-   56        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. net perform sundry circles not geometrically defined, and glancing archly from beneath her long lashes towards her com- panion in disgrace, who had drawn near at the sound of Miss Clinton's voice. "Nothing!" said the angry dame; " nothing! I well be- lieve you; and pray, was it nothing you found to talk about so long? With what style of conversation did that young dandy entertain you so agreeably?" Effie crimsoned at this appellation, and her lip curled scorn- fully, but catching a merry glance from the insulted hero, she resumed her innocent expression, and replied gravely- 1 "He said it was a charming evening, charming place, charming society ;" and silently awaited further inquiry. "Effie Walton, you are the most provoking girl I ever met with. After all my efforts to convince you of the impropriety of your conduct, you are none the better, but grow visibly worse ;, a fact which Effie not pretending to deny, she continu- ed: "O that you had the pride and spirit of a Clinton; but it is foreign to your nature"- a half-suppressed laugh from her amused audience made her regardless of time and place-'" yes," she continued, " foreign to your nature; alas, that a descendant of a noble race should so far forget what is due to her ances- tors' memory; but let me tell you, if I discover you associating with that Miss Gilmer again, you shall return home immedi- ately. You seem leagued, the torments of the place; and who is she, I should like to know, and what, that she is to be your chosen companion? I will learn you, Miss Walton, to select your friends better; and let me see you together again at your peril." "Aunt Dorathea," said Effie; proudly drawing her little form to its full height, her bright eyes flashing defiance, " aunt Dorathea, I am no child to be lectured thus; and when you can choose me better friends, or more congenial, I will submit to your selection. As to ' who' Carrie is, any one can tell you; what,' I fear, you would scarcely appreciate;" and turning   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.       55 away, she sought the distant group around Miss Gilmer, and linking her arm in that of her friend, the two walked away, their pretty heads close together forming some desperate plot of rebellion, it was conjectured by the idle; but Carrie had a kindly heart which prompted -her to soothe with gentle words Effie's mortified feelings, and subdue the anger which was rising in her breast. Miss Dorothea Clinton sailed away, as an old sea captain observed, with all the dignity inherited from the Clintons col- lectively. The scene furnished topic for conversation days after, and the parties became objects of interest to all who heard of it. Miss Clinton devised many plans for the punishment of her daring niece, but through the influence of Charles Walton they were all abandoned, and Effie received instead a brotherly ex- postulation, which she truly heard with becoming gravity; but when it was ended her arms were about his neck, a kiss upon his brow, and he thought her more bewitching than ever. "Charlie, dear," she said, "Carrie Gilmer thinks you posi- tively handsome, and I half agree with her." "Nonsense, Effie," he replied; " now that is a fable of your own invention." It was nonsense, certainly, and very foolish and feminine the blush which that young lady's name called up; very strange that the cheek which had been so often swept by the storm- wind, unchanged, should be thus suddenly colored by the light words of a gay maiden, a very child. Effie opened her eyes wider as he turned away confusedly, drew down the corners of her mouth, and finally indulged in one of her merry laughs. "Oh; Eulalie, do'come with me, and see the new arrivals; all the world-that is, our world--are exercising at least two of the senses allotted them." "Who is she?" returned her friend, listlessly, yet without changing her position. 30   58        SUNBEAMS' AND SHADOWS. "She!" said Carrie; "I do not know who she is, but I take her to be a respectable colored lady. Who I mean is no less a person than the Rev. Walter Duncan, of whom Gertrude writes so much. Mr. Selden tells me his brother is with him, in delicate health." Still Eulie moved not, and Carrie turned impatiently away; then, as if impressed with a sudden thought, she looked back, saying, "Papa says Ellerton Leslie is'here." Eulalie no longer personated a statue, but springing from the couch and throwing aside her book commenced hastily to braid the heavy masses of her hair. Carrie smiled her own provoking saucy smile, and gently seating her, put aside the little hands that trembled too much to do their office, and speedily arranged a becoming coiffure; then picking up the discarded volume, with a low obeisance inquired, ' Will it now please your ladyship to resume your studies?"1 Walter Duncan had been recalled soon after his return to his charge. Henry's illness had become more alarming. His physicians ordered change of air and scene. Minnie was away, and Mr. Duncan could not leave his wife, who was too feeble to undergo excitement or fatigue.. Walter obtained the services of a clerical friend, and leaving him in charge of his little flock, accompanied his brother as his tender nurse and constant companion. Ellerton Leslie and himself (one of the coincidences of life) were fellow-travellers ; and in the course of conversation, El- lerton told him of Mr. Gilmer's family, who he was about to' join, of Carrie, whose name had become familiar-for Gertrude loved to speak of her gay, warm-hearted friend-and the hours which might have been tedious to both passed pleasantly. On their arrival, he was introduced to Mr. Gilmer and Selden, who awaited Ellerton, and the invalid charge was received with that ready sympathy which is ever a welcome greeting, and Walter, who thought for a time to dwell among strangers, found friends, new in name, yet whose kindness made them seem as the fa- miliar ones of other da vs.   CHAPTER XIV. The treasured mnemories of the past, Our hearts still linger o'er; And every day and every hour, We prize them more and more!' WEEKS passed, and still our party lingered at Sha-, with those who had naught to call them elsewhere, because the time pass- ed pleasantly. The invalids seemed to gain strength, and all to win new life and vigor; and yet there were sorrows hidden in the heart's sacred fold: smiles, that were false harbingers of joy; some there were who walked in shade, looking hopelessly on the sunlight that played around them, yet brought to them no warmth or gladness. And thus hath it ever been. Life has many sunny spots, but it has gloomy paths the gay and careless dream not of. There was one amid the throng young and fair, yet hers was now a  mournful beauty, and her sad but gentle glance called forth sympathy unheeding of the cause. The child of light and song, the gifted one, who cast at will a spell on other hearts, had none wherewith to soothe her own. The light, of joy was fading from her eye, and the song upon her lips changed to sadder music, for sorrow had come upon her early. Eulalie Raimond, the betrothed of Ellerton Leslie, had deemed her pathway filled with flowers, bright buds scarcely   60        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. doomed to fade. But he, who oft had come between herself and happiness, who loved her not, yet sought to crush the love of other hearts, now strove to separate them. He would have come himself to take her from those to whom she had been clinging, but disease prostrated him, and he suffered her yet a little while to linger with them; but he bade her forget young Leslie, to meet him as a stranger, for his vow had never yet been broken; and sooner, he wrote, sooner would he lay her by her mother than see her wed the son of him who had ever been the object of his hatred. The fiat had gone forth, and none might strive to soften the decree or bend the will of Albert Raimond. Eulalie dared not resist, for when feelings of rebellion swayed her gentle heart the image of her father seemed to blend with his. He had left his orphan to that bro- ther's care, and though he lightly held the trust, Eulalie bowed in submission, smiling sadly through her tears when Leslie whispered hope of brighter days to come. Mr. Raimond told not how in earlier days his hopes had thus been blighted, how Leslie's father won the prize not all his love or gold could buy, chilling his heart, changing its sweet thoughts to bitterness. He did not tell how he had suf- fered, and conquered; he told her not of this, or she might have pitied even though she blamed; but coldly he commanded her to do as he had done. Forget as he forgot, she never could; for man goes forth in his pride and strength to mingle with his fellows, and the serious cares of life full oft usurp the place of dearer joys, and he makes to himself idols of world- ly wealth, and worships not again at purer shrines. "But woman's world is of the heart, the ties That link her to it, loving friends ; if these Be severed, the sunlight of existence quickly Fades, and there is naught but memory." Eulahe was still the cherished flower of the little home- band who had sheltered her, and with her sorrow new acts of   !?.          SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.         61 kindness were daily lavished on her. Uncle Jacob seemed to regard her with a deeper, holier emotion, watching her every look; and- if perchance he won a brighter smile, his happiness was almost childish. Young hearts can read young hearts, they say; and so it seemed with those who met in that glad summer time. Edward Selden watched Eulalie with strange interest; and when he learned the grief which was come to her loving spirit, he regarded her with the tender sympathy of a brother, and sought to win her thoughts from self. soothing her with words so fraught with encouragement, that Eulalie blessed him in her lonely hours, and thought that care had come to him even as others. One evening, he drew her from the gay groups in the sa. loon, and in tones that thrilled her heart, with touching words, he told his history; and Gertrude's name (that never passed his lips since that parting) seemed the echo of sweet music. He told her all, how his dearest hopes had fled; he taught her how sad it was to pour out the heart's best treasures, and have their weight turned back upon that heart for ever. He bade her think of him in hours of trouble; to remember some there were, who drank more deeply of the bitter cup pressed to her lips. He strove to school his heart, and she too must be strong to stem the tide; and after all, he added bitterly, "Life is a dream, at best; 'tis soon over, the warfare and the strife, and then we shall rest for ever." "Yes. when the hope of immortality is ours," said Enlalie gently, "then it is better far to flee away, and be at rest; but, alas! it is not mine; I have yet to win the assurance which alone can yield us peace." i "You have had a strange teacher, Miss Raimond; but let me assure you, if this be all your solace, it will fail. 'Tis but a fable, bright and fair perchance at first; but like the Arabian fictions, which to childhood's faith seem mirrors of light and truth, but which to the mind in riper years, robbed of their    62        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. magic, retain no trace of former beauty, so this fabric of enthu. siastic minds will, as our own grow stronger, fade into nothing- ness again." Eulahe was startled by his strange words, and turned away, but as she left him said, "Were Gertrude here, Mr. Selden, she could answer you as I may not; she could speak 'of the things which belong to our peace.' I feel their force; I believe their truth, yet am all unable to convince another." "Gertrude!" he said. "Ah I would listen then; but she too is misguided. When you write to her, Miss Raimond, will you recall me to her mind? It is sweet to be remembered by those, whose image haunts our. daily paths, like visions of past joy. Tell her, but no! say what you will, win me some kindly message, some hope, though light, and my heart will bless you." And Eulalie wrote even while the spell of the hour was on her, wrote eloquently, as he would have had her write, and anxiously, with him, awaited some token for good to him, if not to her.   J Our moments of mirth may be many, And hope half our sorrow beguiles, But believe me there cannot be any Whose features are always in smiles." "MR. DUNCAN!" said Effie, playfully, drawing his attention from Henry, who came out on the shady piazza toenjoy the fresh cool air of morning. "Mr. Duncan, will you not take part in our tableaux? We think of engaging Aunt Dorothea and Mr. Jacob Brown, to personate Paul and Virginia, and you can assist Miss Gilmer as the Village Schoolmistress, and play the naughty boy, that stole the marbles from the desk. "Now is not that a temptation?" Walter looked up in surprise, but could not forbear smiling at the seriously comic expression with which she regarded him awaiting his answer. "You are fond  of jesting, Miss Walton," he said, turning again to his brother. "Oh! you do not like the character; well you can make your own selection, only I trust it may not be 'the old man of the mountain' for my gray-bearO of a brother aspires to that. i But perhaps," she continued, mischievously, catching a glimpse of Carrie, who was approaching, "perhaps you would prefer not performing with Miss Gilmer, and indeed I  cannot blame , .   "       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. you," she added, as that young lady joined them. "Carrie, Mr. Duncan declines the honor of being one of your disciples, for reasons best known to himself." "If you are in earnest, Miss Walton," he said, very gravely, "I must not refuse to answer you, but I had hoped you were in jest, for such a proceeding would ill accord either with my feelings or my ministerial duties; but I know," he said, more playfully, " you cannot really wish it ;" and without any seem- ing effort, he turned their attention to the grand tableaux which nature presented to their view. The beautiful scenery around them recalled to mind other spots of beauty he had visited, and in the interest awakened by his incidents of tra- vel, Effie for a time forgot the subject of their late discussion, and bounded away to meet her brother on his return from the spring, with Walter's words sounding in her ear and filling her mind with other thoughts. "Do you intend participating in the amusement Miss Wal- ton spoke of?" said Walter abruptly, turning to Carrie, whose glance followed the movement of her lively friend. "I shall claim the privilege of answering your question with another," said Carrie, thoughtfully. "Do you think it would be wrong?" "(It cannot be right, in more than one sense. Much time is ne- cessarily consumed in preparing for the gratification of an hour; but apart from this, there is something repugnant to my mind in the idea of a young girl's attiring herself fancifully, to be submitted to the idle gaze, and too often impertinent remarks of strangers. Had I a sister, I should be grieved to see her take part in such amusements at such a place. Under other circumstances, it would be different. In the quiet circle of home such things become, in comparison, trifles scarcely to be noticed. I hope I have not offended you," he said, as Carrie turned from him. "Oh no," she replied, " how can you think so? on the con. trary, I thank you for the different light in which you present   -;.?ist'       SUNBEAMS AND SH'ADOWS.       65 it to me. I never thought of consequences, and indeed I fear I am too often heedless of them." Carrie Gilmer refused to engage in the tableaux, nor by dint of exhorting, commanding, or entreating, could Effie turn her from her purpose. She but added to her offence in that young lady's eyes, by persuading Eulalie to resign the part assigned her also; for which double transgression, she was rewarded with a spirited sketch of herself and Eulalie, in the dress of novices, and a mock petition from the Protestant community, that they would immediately return to the con- vent from which they must have recently escaped. It amused : the subjects of her mirth even more than others, so dividing the paper, in order to separate the twin devotees, with a imis- chievous smile, she presented the one to Mr. Jacob Brown, with the love and duty of the original; and the other to Mr. Walter Duncan, with the best wishes of the artist. Frank Travers, Miss Walton's aid on all occasions, was a young artist, who gave promise of rare excellence, and who had deeply offended Miss Clinton by his allegiance to her niece. Finding her remonstrances of no avail with him, she tormented Effie with longer and more frequent lectures than usual, and the poor girl grew weary of the perpetual jarring, and turned to Frank for sympathy.   Well did he kno how to soothe her in such hours; and what wonder if in teaching patience he had learned to pity or to love 1 And all unknown to aunt Dorothea, the wild and wayward girl had promised at some future time to forsake the name become so hateful, for one (which she informed Carrie Gilmer in confidence) she thought quite poetical, To  Carrie were imparted all her :i plans, her hopes, and fears, in this her new-found happiness;  and Carrie sympathized and rejoiced with her, yet ventured ! to suggest that Miss Clinton should be informed of the affair. i- t"Tell Aunt Dorothea? why, Carrie Gilmer, you know not ' what you say.

Carrie sighed too, and thought, as she sought her mother, and twined her arms about her neck, how blessed was her lot. How- little do the happy reck of care when all seems bright before them! The storm cloud gathers, but its dark. ness is scarce noted ere the light is hidden from the view.   CHAPTER XVI.  My life is like a desert rock In the mid ocean, lone and drear, Worn by the wild waves' ceaseless shock That round its base their surges rear. Yet there the sea-moss still will cling, Some floweir will find a cleft to spring, And shed even there a ricla perfume; For me no more life's flowers will bloom.- You have touched a   chord. dear Eulalie," (wrote Gertrude to her friend,) " which vibrates painfully. Oh   may you never know the deep, deep weight of sadness which  the spirit's strength may   scarce support. I  little dreamed, when last we parted, that the future should be filled with memories of those parting hours. I had vainly hoped to still the whisperings of my heart, and  to forget in the realities of the present, that vision of the past.  But now, when I   dreamed the wayward will controlled, the warm  affections all subdued, one word has power to wake the  dream, and in my  weakness, once again I must resolve to struggle for the mastery.  Oh tell him, Eula- lie, tell him to plead no more; I   dare not listen to his words; bid him forget the past; cast aside the spell that binds him  to go upon his way unchecked by thought of me. Yet no H tell him none of this. I scarce know what I write. Oh it i is wrong to yield to these frail hearts of ours; our all of   68       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. happiness would soon be wrecked.  Say to him, Eulalie, gently, as you would that others spoke to you in your own sorrow, say that his welfare is dear to me, even as when we parted; but earthly love must never come between my soul and heaven. Say, that when his heart acknowledges with joy the love of the Creator; when he bends the knee in adora- tion at the throne of grace, and breathes 'Our Father's' name with-reverence and holy fear; if then he still remem- bers me, tell him my prayers shall blend with his, my heart be glad again." Eulalie, in pity for his sorrow, gave to Edward Selden the tiny sheet whereon he read his destiny, hopeless even as he had deemed it. But the heart of man is strong to suffer, and the outward seeming tells not of the grief within. He gazed calmly on the words her pen had traced, re-pertsed them, as though their message were of joy, then returned them to Eulalie, and with an unfaltering voice desired her, when she wrote again, to inclose a few lines for him; and Gertrude's name was breathed no more by either. Yet thought may not be schooled though the lips are sealed at will. Sorrow teaches us to feel for others, and Edward Selden, perchance, looked more kindly on the invalid (who claimed so much of Walter's care) than if his sky had been cloudless and his life all joyous.  For Henry's amusement he recalled scenes in his former home; told him of the brother he had loved and lost; and from its hiding-place brought forth the pictured loveliness of her he once called mother; and as he marked the earnest gaze so fixed upon it, seeking to detain it still, in his deep and thrilling tones would sing the strains of another land, which she had taught him; and it was strange to mark the interest springing up in his heart for Henry, and the unwearied ten- derness and care with which he filled his brother's place, for well he knew by whose side Walter loved to linger, and   tSUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.       69 though his own prospects seemed blighted he could still take pleasure in the happiness of others. Henry, fascinated by the power he could scarcely comprehend, subdued and won by the kindness he could well appreciate, gave him the grateful hom- age of a warm, true heart. Walter's esteem he soon won, and though he did not know his history, there was something half of sadness in his every look and tone that won his sympathy; and when the time drew near for the brothers to return, his vigilance to Henry increased, and Walter was well pleased to see him thus cared for. He urged Selden to accompany them to their home but he declined, for Eulahe was soon to leave for the south, and he had promised to be with her at the parting hour. It seemed a consolation to Ellerton Les- lie to have him accompany her. a privilege denied himself. Eulalie pleaded but in vain that Caroline might for a time, at least, share her new home. She would feel so deso- late with no familiar face or loving voice to meet her; but Mrs. Gilmer could not give her up; she was their all; and it seemed impossible to part with their sunbeam, as her father il fondly styled her. Carrie was thoughtful too, of late, and her gay sallies were less frequent than, of yore, though the I quiet happiness that spoke from her blue eyes forbade the thought of sorrow. The rose-tint had not faded from her cheek, but the laugh and song were not so often heard. A -; bright smile played upon her lips, and it were hard to tell if this new mood were not more fascinating. Perchance Walter Duncan thought so, for his eye rested admiringly on her, and when he came to say "; Good-bye," he lingered as though he :could not turn from the vision of loveliness lest it should come no more. Their parting words seemed not sad, for Walter smiled, and Carrie turned an inquiring gaze toward her mother, ere she answered his request, and as the answer came his look grew brighter still. "I do not object to your writing, Mr. Duncan," Mrs. Gil-   Q70       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. mer replied, "but you must not always expect an answer; perhaps Carrie may send a message sometimes through Ger. trude ;" and Carrie turned to him with one of her old mis- chievous looks, but both seemed well satisfied; and she I repeated message after message he was to bear to Gertrude, while he wondered if she expected him to remember the half.   ? CHAPTER XVIL ," Some: are happy, some are sad, Life hath changes dark and glad; We meet to-day, to-morrow, part; We hide within the inmost heart The many cares and woes of earth, And feel its joys are little worth." ORIA. AUTUMN came and passed, friends had met and parted, going on their way with memories of mingled joy and sorrow. The beautiful resort, about which clustered many fond re- miniscences, had long been deserted; the summer flowers were buried, and the leaves had been swept away by the wild winds that told of coming winter. Eulalie Raimond had gone from the hearts that cherished her, to one who prized her not. Caroline Gilmer wandered from one accustomed haunt to another, but turned sadly away from each, for they could not give her back the sweet companionship of her who had become scarcely less dear than a sister. Mr. Brown's listless gaze followed her movements, but the old man seemed to grow more feeble daily, and lost his inter- est in the scenes around him. He missed the voice which grew more gentle when it called on him, the loving eyes, whose glance was a balm to his spirit; and those who knew him best    72       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. marvelled at the influence that the young girl had almost un- consciously won over him; but none save his sister, Mrs. Gil- mer, knew the cause. His earlier days had been passed in a foreign country. There he had wooed and won the love of a fair young girl, and deemed his lot so blest; but ere she was his bride, the de- stroyer that spareth not had marked her for his own. In the morning she was beside him full of life, a sunbeam to his heart, at noon she sang for him the song he loved, at eve he was alone. Eulie Gonzalo was laid in the burial-place of her an- cestors, but her memory lived ever in his heart. He grew old while yet young, and when he returned to his native land he sought his sister's hearth, and seldom could be tempted from it. Years passed, Carrie grew to womanhood, and brought to her home Eulalie Raimond. and her voice and eye brought before him the treasure of his youth, and from that time he gave to her the lost one's name, and loved her with a strange, deep love. Ellerton Leslie's days passed wearily ; but when evening came it often found him at Mr. Gilmer's fireside, for there at least he heard the name that was now a mournful music; and there was not unfrequently a kindly message, which Carrie always rejoiced to give. It is strange to think how one broken link in the chain of home casts a shadow on it, changing its brightness almost to gloom. Eulalie, too, wrote sadly; there was, she said, one among the many whom she met, who looked upon her with affection, and perhaps Carrie would laugh, for it was a. slave; one who had been much attached to her mother. She seemed, said Eulalie, to grow almost young again as she recounted inci- dents of her mother's life, and recurred again and again to scenes of her childhood, and the poor old creature seemed quite happy to find that she listened with pleasure.   (::rB' SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.                73 j;T    Mr. Selden she saw but rarely. He was more than ever  absorbed in study, and when he came, they could but refer to the past, and much of that was too painful to be dwelt upon. Such were the accounts Gertrude Weston received from Carrie Gilmer, who wrote often to her friend, and Gertrude ,i; sighed, for the sunlight of life seemed to her more dim than of yore, but she yielded not to her heart's dictates; she lived not for herself alone. She was her mother's stay, the comfort of her failing years; to her the little Lucy looked for guiding love, and there were many daily claims upon her heart and mind which strengthened her to turn from the whisperings of her own troubled spirit. Gertrude learned of Him who bade us bear each other's burdens; unto Him she breathed her earnest prayer for " grace to help in every time of need;" and who that trusted thus has ever been confounded? Her letters were to: Carrie a sunbeam of gladness; they soothed with the affection that breathed in every line; they contained kind remembrances for every friend with whom she had been associated at Mr. Gilmer's, and there were often added, dictated by the young minister, some valued lines, which doubtless contained words full of consolation; at least, such they seemed to Miss Gilmner, for the light of her eye - grew brighter, and her smile more joyous as she conned them o'er and o'er. Henry Duncan seemed to have regained his wonted health and vigor, and wrote even gayly to Walter of home and home ; friends. The world went well with some, who knew  not of the cares gathered about the homes and in the hearts of their fellow-mortals; and yet, little as we know or reck of each other's welfare here, the day must come when, in the presence of a re-awakened world, our ways shall be made known, even as we are known to Him who sitteth at the right hand of God, whose word created worlds. And the question arises in many 4   74        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. a heart, as thoughts like these come crowding up, "Who shall be able to stand?" Poor Effie Walton went on her way as ever, yet scarcely as light-hearted. The stream of life was more troubled than of yore.  Her brother was voyaging afar, and long years might elapse ere she could look again on his glad face. Report said that some magic word of Miss Gilmer's. had banished the young officer, but when does rumor ever speak aright. It might have been, for Effie talked not so often of her former friend, and the promise of long and frequent let- ters had not been so faithfully kept, as such promis-es should be. "Whom do you think, dear Carrie, has come among us?" (wrote Gertrude to Miss Gilmer), 'no less a person than Miss Helen Glenn! She is, they tell me, an heiress and an orphan. She is with her uncle, who is now her guardian. I have not called on her, for, to speak the truth, I care not to renew the slight acquaintance of our school-days. I saw her at church last Sabbath, but she vouchsafed no sign of recog- nition. I doubt if she will be content in our quiet town; she has been accustomed to the gayety of a city, and her haughty, and sometimes scornful demeanor, will deprive her even of the social pleasures which we here enjoy. Carrie's reply was in one of her old merry moods, and Gertrude smiled as she had not for many months, over the gay words which told of a lighter heart. She desired Ger- trude to lose no time in visiting Miss Glenn; also that she would present to her old admirer her humble regards, and ask if she (Carrie Gilmer) might venture to ask a place among those of the Brandon's disciples, cherished in the memory of the fair Helen? Any acknowledgment to that effect would be received with becoming deference and gratitude."   CHAPTER XVIII. Our truest chart Is resignation to the Almighty's will For ' tribulation worketh patience ' still; Patience exrerience, and experience hope.2 And thus is power afforded to fulfil Each duty, till the thorns with which we cope Burst forth in grateful flowers." "DEAR papa, what can the matter be?"' said Caroline Gilmer on a   cold December eve, drawing her chair near the cheerful fires seating herself beside him. iHere  have  I been playing your   favorite airs for the last half hour, yet not a word has my performance elicited   And  sucha sigh!  Are you  ill, dear papa?" and  the arffectionate girl ilasped her arms about his neck and fondly kissed his cheek. No, my  d  aughter, I  am weary, not ill" he said at length; care to hear me sing, so I shall talk instead, and remind you of the near approach of Christmas. But one short week now intervenes and yet, with all my tact and discrimination, I can- not give the remotest guess, as to what my dear father is pre-   76       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. paring to surprise my remarkable self; but I shall expect some. thing out of the common order. As for mamma, I intend to have a copy of her own sweet self, set in one of 'those tiny cases we admired so much last week, and then I shall say as the school-boy to his book, ' You and I shall never part;' and certainly with more sincerity than the poor little victims to knowledge." Mr. Gilmer sighed yet more deeply; and left his seat, pa- cing with eager tread the length of the apartment, pausing ever and anon, looking on her with unutterable tenderness, then resuming his troubled walk. Carrie sat musing silently for awhile, then placing a low cushion by her mother, leaned her head on the couch beside her, wondering at the strange mood that came o'er her father. But other and happier thoughts came in their turn, and the image of one, not a stranger now, came up before her with fond and pleasant memories. Waking thoughts gradually blended with the imagery of dream-land; and when Mrs. Gillner, sur- prised by the unusual silence of her -child, lifted the falling curls from the fair face they shrouded, she saw that Carrie slept. Her mother's kiss disturbed her not, and a happy smile on the half-closed lips told of joyous thoughts. "Oh, Marion, my own i!" murmured Mr. Gilmer, as he bent above the mother and the child; must I blight the hopes of that dear dreamer; chase the smile from those lips; dim the brightness of her life by the change that has come to us? If it were mine to bear alone, I should not murmur; but to take you, my beloved ones, from the home, so long your own, to taste the bitter cup of adversity, how can it be?" and he looked around on the luxurious apartment; in which all things spoke of them, the very air of which seemed hallowed by their presence. A tide of recollection swept across his soul, subdu- ing the strong man even to tears.          Mr. Gilmer had endorsed to a great amount for one whom he had deemed honorable and true, whose character had hither   SUNBEAMS AND SaADOWS.        " to been esteemed unblemished, his friend, the endeared asso- ciate of his youth. They had been Darted for many years, and Mr. Gi]mer had only met him in his occasional visits to New-York. He had received very distressing accounts from him: he wrote of his misfortunes in a touching manner, appealed to Mar. Cilmer in behalf of the wife and children, who, without aid, would be homeless and destitute; and unsuspecting of evil, Mr. Gilmer generously granted his request, and relieved him from distress. Some time after this occurrence, Mr. Gilmer heard, that the man whom he so trusted, whom he had so greatly obliged, was indeed a reckless gambler. But it ended not with this. The darkest deed was yet to be unveiled  Mr. Giliner lhaving one day occasion to call upon his banker, the latter smilingly inquired, if he possessed the genii's magic ring; adding, that the large drafts lately presented by him, had somewhat sur- prised him. Mr. Gilmer was amazed, and inquired his mean- ing; and then and there discovered, that his name had been forged by the wretch whom he had so generously relieved. The viper he had warmed and sheltered, stung him to the quick; and bowed in heart, and broken in spirit, he went to his home /4is no longer. He sought the counsel of those high in their profession, but legal aid could not avail him; for he who had sinned against him had fled, none knew whither. Noclue was left to trace him. The wealth which Mr. Gilmer had amassed by the un- wearied industry of years, seemed to have been swept from him as it were in a moment. In his later years, he must, see the beings he so idolized leave the home endeared by fond and /holy memories, for an humbler dwelling, deprived of luxuries to which they had ever been accustomed-his fragile wife, and fair young child, the bright being around whom he delighted to cluster all that wealth could bring of the'rare and beautiful, to please her fancy, and to gratify her taste. But in the hour which seemed to him so dreary, he found   78       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. them strong to bear with him the unexpected stroke. They soothed, and cheered; formed plans for the future; cherished hopes he feared could ne'er be realized; and Carrie's smile seemed not less joyous, for when he told her of their new home, how different it must be, she would answer with a fond caress, and assure him that while he was there to guide and guard them, it would be home still to them. Poor Uncle Jacob, they tried in vain to make him under- stand that he must give up his accustomed haunts. He would listen with a bewildered air, and long after they left their old dwelling, he would clasp in his hand his greatest treasure-a beautiful miniature painting of Eulalie-and after many a weary step, would rest at last before the door, now closed on him, and for hours watch eagerly the coming and going of those who dwelt there; and at last, with a wistful glance at the lov- ing face so faithfully portrayed on the cold ivory, -vould retrace his steps, murmuring, "She will not come to-day!"It seemed his greatest comfort, this daily pilgrimage of the childlike old man; and it seemed vain to oppose him. So they let him watch. and hope on; and when he came shivering back again, Carrie strove to soothe himn with the songs that Eulalie sang, and for a time he seemed forgetful of his sorrow.   CHAPTER XIX. "Oh never may'st thou know The darkened spirit's dream of woe. God's own pure gift to me, I bless The Giver, and the gift no less. But when I fold thee to my heart, And feel how very dear thou art, I tremble, lest my love should be The crime ofdeep idolatry." "DEAR Gertrude, you must come    to us in our new home" Carrie Gilmer wrote, in reply to a letter from her full of af- fectionate sympathy, which cheered and soothed the hearts of the little band to whom it was addressed. (Each had become more dear to each in misfortune.)  You must come  to us and see for yourself how many new lessons I  have learned. I fancy our sitting-room (which is my peculiar care) second only to your own. It is graced by my harp still, a pleasant remem- brance of other days, which papa would not part with . My pet canary has a  corner too, and looks condescendingly on the roses and camelia in close vGcinity; and the bright sunbeams are not for  getful to look in on us, as some of the friends of by-gone hours, who now pass us by as though we had never been. Such is the world's friendship; in prosperity, it lives -but in adversity, passes away. But seriously, I  think we are quite as happy as formerly, if I could only persuade papa to believeit. His anxious fears for us are sometimes really   80        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. distressing. He persists in imagining my gayety assumed. Come and help me to undeceive him, you know he has great faith in you." The answer came, but not as expected, and doubtless creat- ed much surprise; for when theJ  Walter Duncan, on a cold morning, was ushered into /that same sitting-room, Miss Gilmer strangely forgot for a bre time to welcome him. But he was not heard to complain; and for several hours he re- mained engaged in conversation with that young lady and her mother; and when about to leave, seemed well pleased to ac- cept the invitation to return that evening. Day after day found him still lingering, but doubtless the business matters that detained him were of deep import. A week had elapsed ere he deemed it scarce begun; but Walter never suffered inclination to overcome a sense of duty. To others, ever lenient; towards himself, he was most- exact- ing. It scarce needs words to tell that parting. The missive he bore back to Gertrude, revealed a heart's history; its hopes and fears, its trusting love. It told what she had long ago- di- vined; it asked and won her heart-felt sympathy and sincere congratulations for the friends so highly valued. The idol of the world for a brief season the flattered and caressed, the treasure of fond true hearts, prized not the boons that worldlings covet. In the days of her prosperity she had yielded her affections to one, who though worthy of the prize, dared not seek them then; for he had naught to offer, save the homage of a noble heart, and a simple village home. But now that change bad come to her, he sought in all timidity to plead and win, the bright and beautiful to bless his life. She was his, yet not all his own; and years perchance might pass ere she would be his bride. She could not leave the mother, who seemed daily to be passing from them; and her father's engagements would not leave him free for two long years. Walter was too happy to oppose the decision prompted   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        81 by filial affection. He would wait for years, if she were but won ; at last. He had seen her in the days of worldly joy, amid ad- :;  miring crowds, scarce conscious of her own loveliness, turning ever to those who formed her world-a tender mother and idol- izing father-and now that riches had fled from them, the joy of her happy spirit still gladdened an humbler home, and she sought her greatest pleasure in adding to that of its inmates. She gave up her wonted pursuits and amusements, without a murmur; and in the hour of trial, Carrie Gilmer proved not merely the gay companion of sunny hours that some had named her, but a noble and true-hearted woman.  She looked ioro to the inner life. more kindly on her fellow-mortals. She learned that earth had deeper sorrows than she had dreamed of. She heard of the suffering, and visited, for the first time, the abodes of misery, and, from  her now diminished store, still found means to aid; and those who had flattered and caressed her in other days, would have marvelled to see the young girl bend ing o'er the bed of sickness in the dwelling of the desolate: still more would they have wondered had they known   that such acts of mercy had produced purer enjoyment than the ,  hours formerly wasted in gay and crowded saloons. They would have thought her strangely altered; and yet it was merely the awakening of dormant energy called forth by the circumstances in which she was now placed. Walter deemed her a   treasure beyond all earthly price, and thought how bright ,this earth would be with her beside Mim. He went back with a   thankful heart for the blessings of life forgetting not in that glad hour the giver of all good. F rom Walter's fond parents  -and Henry, Carrie received earnest and affectionate assurances of their participation in his great joy. They longed for the tinle when they should be permitted to greet one, of whom thev had heard so much, and whose welfare was now so dear to them. And Minnie Carlton, who knew her well, what said she in i response to the companion of her girlhood? Naught; for 4*   g82g      SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. what heart devoid of the Holy Spirit's loving influence, when  filled with bitter anguish7 can turn-to greet with joy one who (though unconsciously) had added to its weight of woe 2 Car- rie received no message of love from her. Hopeless indeed was now her life's long dream; a ision that had grown dim of late, butt its brightness had now gone out for ever. Alas for Minnie in that one dark season. Those who loved her'watched her pale cheek and listless step with tender anxiety for the change coming over her. She was growing cold and proud, sometimes irritable; she deemed herself a mark'for misery; her strong mindseemed yielding to evil influences. Had she forgotten the proud resolves of that parting the nobleness of spirit that strove for the mastery of self? It had been well for her had memory held its sway, blending with that time thoughts of the loving care around her, the devoted tender- ness she yet might pine to know. It had been well for her, perchance it might have saved the reproach of many an after hour. Minnie felt that the thoughts warring with nobler im- pulses were all unworthy of her, but as yet all memories of Carrie' were sad to her; and shunning companionship, even of the home circle, in solitude she gave herself up to the domi- nion of her wayward heart, adding to her sorrow the inward consciousness of doing wrong. Henry was on the eve of marriage. Lizzie Reed's affec- tion gave a brighter charm to the life he thought so beautiful. But not even this seemed to wile poor Minnie's thoughts from self, and Lizzie marvelled at the strange words that seemed penned by a trembling hand and a sad heart, mingled ever and anon with gay sallies, too wild for the calm nature of her friend. Iu the bright spring-time Henry's home would also be hers, and the gentle girl resolved to devote herself to Minnte, and strive to win from her the cause of this; and if there ware sorrow that they knew not of, she would share it too.  .                  1   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        83 Lizzie looked forward to that meeting hopefully, almost as a release, for Mrs. Brandon grew more exacting, and it had become difficult, even to one of Lizzie's gentle nature, to sub- mit to her caprices. She did not oppose Lizzie's marriage, but she rather ap- proved of it; yet at times she would reproach her for the wish to leave her. The place seemed still more dreary since she had shared the joy of other homes, and mingled with those so different. Monsieur De Ville died the year after her old class-mates left them, and during his last sickness he would often repeat Carrie's name, coupled with some endearing epithet.  To him she always seemed the bright and joyous child, whom years before he welcomed there. Mademoiselle La Rue had returned to la belle France, for which she so much pined, and Carrie's old acquaintance, Wash- ington B. Burns, was the sole remaining light of other days, and he had become almost a cipher. And so it is with earth's frail children, changing ever from gay to sad, the light deepening into shadow.   CHAPTER XX. Her lot is on thee-silent tears to weep, And patient smiles to wear through suffering's hour." "4 I see full many a dream depart, With faithless speed; And some who should have gently used my heart Have made it bleed." THE twilight hours in those southern  limes, how beautiful they are! They have a spell of loveliness for every heart. When the last breath of the flowers, borne on the breeze, kisses the cheek and fans the brow, bringing a calm to the spirit; when the last song-bird's echo still lingers on the ear, like melody from a better land, then one by one the bright stars meet the heavenward glance, and their pure rays speak of peace and rest beyond their own blue homes.  Even the me- mory of such hours is dear to the weary, the wandering, and was such a time as this Eulalie Raimond left the soli- tude of her chamber, and, leaning against one of the marble pillars of the balcony, looked out on a scene which might have soothed the saddest heart. Yet she seemed unconscious of its beauty, her thoughts were far away, and heedlessly she plucked the feathery sprays of the night jasmine, clustered near her,   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        85 seemingly with no other purpose than to scatter the snowy blossoms on the ground. Long and earnestly she mused, looking oftentimes to the bright sky with a sad- and pleading glance. A heavy step roused her from her reverie, but ere, she could retire a gen- tle touch detained her. A dark and stern-browed man stood beside her, and, with folded arms, gazed on the shrinking girl a moment in silence and then addressed her. I "Eulalie, have you heard my will, or am I to repeat it o'er and o'er, as to a wayward child? Ah! you tremble! where is the pride of which your ancestors made boast; where the spirit of defiance which would brave my anger?" For a time he paced, wit, firm and haughty tread, the long gallery, crushing the light flowers that were scattered there, until the air seemed laden with the incense of their dying breath. Then, pausing once more by her side, he con- tinued: "Eulalie Raimond, once, I have spoken; again I re- peat it. You wed the young Chalon, and that right speedily; I care not how you list his wooing, I care not if you smile or frown upon his suit. It matters naught to me. I have pro- mised. You must obey, or woe for the future."  Eulalie trembled .as she heard her uncle's words, seeming the death- knell of her dearest hopes. One moment her glance quailed beneath the cold look bent upon her, but only for a moment. "Uncle," she said, and her voice was like the tones of sad music, " uncle, I too have spoken, nor can my words be now recalled. I have said that to Mr. Chalon, which I can but re- peat, were his suit renewed; I love him not, I cannot wed him!" "And this to me! how dare you calmly utter words like these to me? You know not what you say. Go to your room, and let me see you no more until you learn that obedience is the wiser course. Yet stay," he said, as she was gladly avail- ing herself of his permission, and he grasped her hand, until the pressure pained her, and in a low husky voice he said,   86       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. "Eulalie, listen, and you will know that I have judged well for you now. You deem yourself the possessor of thousands; the world calls you an heiress of broad lands; but you and it are much deceived; the meanest child of poverty that treads the pave of our city is not more destitute. You have naught on earth; your riches exist but in name, and I am the cause! Nay, shudder not at this; there is not much love between us, I well know, and even that little may be changed to hatred. It matters not; love has never blessed my life. The star of a mother's deep and holy love never beamed upon my pathway, for she died ere I learned to speak her name. No sister's gentle care,no brother's confidence and trust ever changed the current of my life, for I was alone! I loved once, fondly loved, but I was scorned, and I have crushed the least remains of feeling in my heart. I never won affection from any ; from you, I never sought it. But I wronged you, and would fain repair the injury, yot if you thwart my will, I cast you from me; my roof shall not shelter you, the world can care for you as best it may. I give you my reasons, for I believe you to be not the child I took you for, but a woman strong to act, and to suffer if it need be. The mania for speculation seized me, and years ago, in a mad, wild, scheme, I staked your all. It failed, and left you penniless. My own property was the next investment;. that too was lost, and no alternative remained but labor to main- tain myself and you. But fortune for once favored me, and ere I had known privation, the death of an old uncle, whom I had never seen, placed me once more in affluence. He made me his heir because I had never bowed down to his wealth, or fawned and flattered with the crowd. "I had meant well by you, but the chances had been against me; yet I resolved that you should never feel your loss. I gave you every advantage, gratified every wish, spared no expense, and but for the wilfulness of this hour, you had never heard aught of the past." He paused and looked   i-?                 * SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.  almost pityingly upon her; then, as though urged on by the spirit of evl continued Methinks your words may yet be it   changed: Eulalie Raimond, raised in luxury, will scarely hesitate between the bride of the wealthy Chalon, and the toil that wins the daily bread of the destitute. Go to your bed child, and to-morrow you will not say him nay." Eulie moved not, and in surprise and anger he heard her repeat, in firm and gentle words, her former assurance. "If the strange words you have spoken deceive me not," she said, ' far betterwould it be to go forth, trusting to the cold world's kindness, than to wear a gilded chain, or breathe a perjured vow. My pledged word to another and my own conscience forbid the thought.", "Ha! this then is your refuge,", returned Mr. Raimond angrily, "your pledged word! So you  will seek him in your need? And this is your maiden reserve! But doubtless when you plead your cause in touching words, that tell of tears and anguish, your chosen knight will fly to the rescue of a forlorn damsel, although he has suffered months to elapse without an inquiry or token of the affection from which you hope so much  It  is well M iss Raimond; tell him all your sorrow; it is well you can depend upon him ;" and with a sneering laugh he left her. With weary step and sinking heart she sought her room and throwing herself on  a low couch, buried her face in her hands, as though she would shut out even  memory. Bitter thloughts were in her heart; his taunting, humiliating words seemed ringing in her ears, andthat ' mocking laugh was seeming- ly beside her. What a future lay beforebher! Sh e had none to look to, none to help her; she must go on her weary way, un- friended and alone, but she would  every an  y where, it were but  far from him. for w hose dear sake she suffered , she would brave all things could she but find a s helter unknown to those she loved best on the earth. Wild plans and strange sche mes for the future fitted across her mind in the darkness   88       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. of that hour. She would work, she would write any thing, but Leslie must not know it; he should never see her more. The long hours of the night passed wearily; thoughts of the past and present crowded on her mind with such a crushing weight. Homeless and helpless, what was left to live for? Her heart throbbed wildly, and there seemed a pressure on her very brain. She could not weep ; a strange weariness came o'er her, then a dizziness that seemed so near to death, and she knew no more of joy or sorrow for many long, long days. When Linda (the old woman who had learned to love the young girl in her loneliness) came, in the morning, she found her in the delirium of fever. Wild snatches of song were on her lips, changing to bursts of laughter, which sounded strangely in that chamber of luxury and woe, then dying away amid sobs like those of a tired child, would be heard in bro- ken words the names of her mother and of Leslie. Woe to the cold and worldly spirits that would dash the cup of joy from the young and light-hearted; that would crush the pure and guileless spirit; that would teach dark lessons of suspicion and distrust; the heart that forgets to feel for its fellows that would trample on the helpless, the lonely, and the destitute! Woe for such! An hour must come when they shall own, in contrition and despair, the power of an avenger- the Mighty One and Just. And there are such in the world's crowded mart! There are homes which seem all fair and bright, and yet are darken- ed by the shadow of a spirit like to this. Yet the world recks not, knows not of it; looks not beneath the veil that hides the heart's struggles and its sorrows. But there is One who know- eth all things. There is a heaven where every thought is heard; there will come a day when thoughts, and words, and deeds shall all be judged!    CHAPTER XXI.

Again she ventured to say how ill she had found her young mistress, but he angrily interrupted her. Are  ou sti croaking there?" he said, k, I thought I bid ou begone.

Mr. Selden and the nearest physician were hastily sum- moned, and each found much cause for anxiety.  Finding that Mr. Raimond had really gone, Mr. Selden undertook to care for the helpless girl so far as it lay in his power. A skilful nurse was procured, and intelligence of her imminent danger dispatched to her northern friends. Three weary weeks passed by, and slowly, as from'bewilder- ing dreams, the young girl wakened to consciousness. She knew she had been ill, but it was long ere she could realize the past events, which, for a time, obliterated thought and memory; events which had blighted the hopes of her young life, scatter- ing its early promises as the wild winds of autumn lay the forest leaves low on the earth, sweeping them on and on in their might, leaving no trace of beauty that has been. -But with returning reason came the joyous thought, that she was not all forsaken and friendless, as she had feared. A soft hand bathed her burning brow, a low voice spoke in tones that thrilled her heart, so strangely familiar did they seem. It could not be, and yet it was no dream, for Leslie's mother watched beside her, soothing with kind words and blest hopes for the future. Mr. Selden had told all that they could gather from Eula- lie's wild and incoherent words, and her heart yearned towards the desolate orphan. Ellerton was far away, and she resolved to seek her, now that one who should so tenderly have guarded her had left her to the mercy of hirelings. She resolved to go, and, if possible, nurse her back to health: take her to her own home, and give her a cherished place in her affection. "My daughter," she said one evening, when Eulalie, sup- ported by pillows, sat near the open window watching the last sunset rays; "' my daughter," (and the pale cheek of the inva- lid wore a deeper tint than in her days of health,) "you will   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.       91 soon be able to return with me, you are so much stronger; and the familiar scenes of other days will make you happy as you once were."2 "Oh no," she sadly murmured, r that happiness can come no more for me; you forget how great the barrier between this present, and that joyous time ; do not, dear Mrs. Leslie, tempt me; it cannot be ;" and the gathering tears glistened in her eyes. "Eulalie, my child, do not speak thus hopelessly; suffer not dark thoughts like these to mar your peace. That fragile form and timid spirit are illy fitted to brave alone the storms of life. He, who in the order of His providence, has left you motherless; who for a time now chastens ybu, to point you to a hand that will ever sustain you; to a love, which will never fail or forsake you He, in your hour of trial and of need, through one of His creatures, proffers aid and consolation; and will you reject the offered love, the care which would fain cir- cle your future pathway, and shield you from life's ills? Will you refuse to soothe the heart which that same  Hand has deeply smitten? turn from the lollely home your presence may gladden  He has given us to each other, and I will strive to fill a mother's place to you; and you, dear Eulalie, shall be to me, as was the child God called unto himself." And thus with winning words she soothed the weary girl until at times she half forgot her sorrow. It seemed indeed to her, that a kind and merciful Father had sent an earthly comforter in this her darkest time of need; and gradually she resigned herself to Mrs. Leslie's guidance, listening to the his- tory of her past life,) till. in comparison, her own griefs seemed almost trivial. From Leslie's mother Eulalie first learned the way of truth; with her, she turned to the Book of Life, and in its pages read the message of Him who offers life evermore to those that seek his fae. With her, she bent the knee in humble penitential prayer, seeking a refuge for the weary heart s peace r^S.-S-"^1,;'.";pa   92       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. for the broken spirit. Day after day they spoke of heaven, and heavenly joys; the one, so earnestly striving to guide; the i. other, in her youth and beauty, turning when the storm-cloud lowered, to Him who promises to comfort those that mourn. The darkness of the past seemed fading before the new light dawning upon her now; ifs loneliness forgotten in the blest consciousness that One all powerful and wise, One whose name is love, was watching o'er her. He had spoken to her heart in the tempest-time of grief; in the dark hour of despair; and now His still small voice was heard, telling of peace, of hope, and joy. In that solemn hour, with the spell of holy feelings on her, she twined her arms about Mrs. Leslie, and with a glance all eloquent of love, she murmured, '"Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be His name!" and was there no an- swering tone within that mother's heart 2 Tears, such as angels might have wept in joy, fell thick and fast upon the orphan's head. She had guided the weary one to "Him, who hath loved us,") and now that rest was won, she blessed with her the Glorious Giver that all indeed was well. Ere they left the place, which had for Eulalie some painful reminiscences, they visited the last resting-place of her mother. There was but little in that " city of the dead," to tell that she was still remembered. The once proud monument that had been placed above her, was discolored by the touch of time. The simple name, age and date, told little to the passer by, save that in, youth a soul had been summoned to eter- nity. It taught a lesson, yet few would heed it. The last time Eulahe had been there, she had wept lonely, bitter tears above the mouldering dust; but now, that grave spoke to her in thrilling tones of the new hope won,-teaching her to look beyond its narrow bourne, to the land where tears are never wept; where Death can never come; where the light fades not, for "the glory of God is there," and the ' Lamb is the light thereof."   SUNBEAMS AND SIIADOWS. 93 Mr. Selden accompanied the travellers the first stage of their journey, but they were unwilling to detain him, so he returned alone with sadder memories in his heart, and for a time forget- ful of the comforting messages Eulalie's kind feelings prompted to old Linda.  He was touched by Eulalie's parting gift- small pocket Bible, which Gertrude had given to her in their school-days; a fewwords, in Gertrude's writing were pencilled within it: "My heart's desire and earnest prayer to God for thee is, that thou may'st be saved ;" and beneath it Eulahe had added from  Holy Writ, "Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things." He would not promise to read the book, when Eulalie uirged him to do so, but these half-legible words seemed impressed on his heart; they came to him as the whisper of a guardian spirit, by day and by night; and ever and anon he would turn the pages o'er and read the precious promises which Gertrude loved. Yet still his heart rebelled, and he strove to hush the whisperings of the Spirit. Eulalie desired to remain for a ime with Carrie, then pay to Gertrude a long-promised visit. grs. Gilmer understood and respected the feelings of the ensitive girl, and, loving her so well, sought not to oppose her 'ish, and well concealed the reluctance with which she yielded er to Mr. Gilmer's care.   CHAPTER XXII. joy! the lost one is restored, Sunshine comes to hearth and board.

She entered cheerfully into Carrie's plans, shared her pursuits, and a new light seemed shed in the little home circle, and the joyous laugh which speaks of happiness within the heart, made sweet music there full oft. Carrie never spoke to Eulalie of the past; but one bright evening, when good-nights had been exchanged with all the rest, they went together to their room, where the moon- light had looked in before them, casting fairy shadows all about, still and beautiful, yet so calm. They put aside the curtain, and looking out on the peaceful sky, spoke their thoughts aloud. Eulalie seemed to feel the spell of the hour; it recalled nights of beauty she had passed in a brighter clime contrasting gladly with them, for then she was alone, with naught to cheer her. She told Carrie all that had passed; of the dark sha- dows which seemed to enshroud her; of the stern man, who should have been to her a father, but who had cast her off, careless of her fate. She spoke of the sunlight which succeed- ed that deep gloom; of the voice which woke her from that sleep of forgetfulness; of the peace and pardon it offered in the name and through the intercession of a risen Saviour; and she told of the joy which filled her heart when first she felt that   (though an earthly guardian had forsaken her in anger) "God was reconciled," and now with childlike confidence she could look up and say, "Abba,' Father." The tears fell fast and warm upon the cheek then pressed to hers, as she urged Carrie in her youth to seek to dwell in the light of that Sun which now beamed- so brightly on her way. She told her that in the solemn hour, when she felt how near her steps had tended to " the dark valley," she had thought of her; and prayed (when they indeed must pass through its shade) that His presence might go with them, His rod and His staff still comfort them. Carrie was still and thoughtful; it brought to mind so   96        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. forcibly Walter's words, for it was thus he loved to turn her thoughts from earth to heaven, and now, as then, she longed to know, with them, joy and peace in believing. She read the words of Holy Writ; she acknowledged their truth and beauty; but they spoke not to her heart in tones of mighty power. She entered the house of prayer, but the preaching of the Word seemed to 'affect her not. She bowed the knee in the worshipping assembly, yet arose unchanged as she had knelt. She reverenced religion, but she had not yield- ed to its influence. And thus she made answer to Eulalie's gentle pleadings, and as they laid down to rest, she whispered, "Walter promised to pray for me ; and so,'darling, must you." Mrs. Leslie came frequently to seek her fair young charge. She would sit with the girls for hours, and join in their con- versation as they plied the needle, or occupied themselves in tracing for her the flowers she so much loved. Sometimes a letter from Ellerton would add interest to their interviews. Eulahe had exacted from Mrs. Leslie a promise that she would not inform him of her arrival or aught that had passed concerning her. It was only on this condition she would con- sent to remain with her for a tithe. He was then in England, and unless matters of import should recall him, it was his wish to visit Italy ere he returned. He was tempted to play truant for a longer period than he had anticipated, and it might, per- haps, be long ere he heard his mother's voice again. He wrote of Eulalie, asking tidings of one who, though lost to him, was none the less dear; whose image was ever with him; whose memory was the brightest blessing left him, save a mother's never changing love.

House " was left to the tender mercy of attendants, while Effie went none knew whither. Sometimes, accidentally of course, she met Frank, the artist, who had some new subject for his pencil, some new point of view, that she must see; and it was often so distant, that long hours would elapse ere she returned. Naughty, wilful Effie! It was for one of these excursions, (after Miss Clinton had been unusually at variance with the world in general, and her niece in particular,) that Effie, bathing her face to remove the tell-tal traces of emotion, took her bonnet and left the house. The afternoon passed, the sun went down, the shadows of evening came on, and yet she returned not. Miss Dorathea called for her in vain; inquiries passed from one to another; grave looks and significant gestures among the members of the lower house; but no information could be given concerning the missing one. Search was made about the grounds, and finally a messenger dispatched to the village, whither she sometimes went to visit a friend, but she had not been there, so the servant went back, to be censured for failing to bring the information he could not obtain. A day or two passed on, and no tidings of this degenerate descendant of the Clintons. At last, an Albany Gazette was placed in Miss Clinton's hand, containing a notice of a marriage, and the name left no doubt as to the identity of the bride. Oh wayward Effie! that high spirit formed thee new troubles, I ween, in thine onward course. After a time came a letter, which Aunt Dorathea could scarce read for the trembling of the hand which held it, and which in indignation she cast from her and crushed beneath her feet, thereby greatly retarding her convalescence. It did not speak of remorse; no, nor yet of anger; it simply explained, that unable longer to submit tamely to the unmerited censure to which her whole life had been subjected, she had consented to a step which, had there been one alle- viating circumstance, one ray of hope for the future, she would   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        99 1?  have-utterly condemned. She did not now regret on her own account; and she thought her absence must surely be a relief to one, who had never seemed to take pleasure in her presence. She knew that she must resign luxuries, to which she had ever been accustomed; Frank had naught but his profession, and I   her own small income would scarce suffice for both; but Fi  though their home was humble, it was a peaceful one; and should Miss Clinton ever feel more kindly towards them, she At  would always find a welcome there i' In a letter addressed to Carrie Gilmer, some months later, she more fully expressed her sentiments, wrote unreservedly I   of her happiness, her hopes, and prospects for the future; a letter characteristic of the joyous Effie, of Mrs. Brandon me- mory, telling but little of matronly dignity.' Aunt Dorathea said she would always be a child, and she sometimes thought the saying prophetic. "Dear Carrie,' commenced the strange epistle, "open those blue eyes in amazement when this new signature meets your eager glance, but turn not from me in your loving heart, nor think me changed to you in aught save the calling of a name. Perhaps you will send me a long lecture on the impropriety of I   my conduct, for you must have' heard ere this; that Hyes, even I-without knowledge or consent of Miss Dorathea Clinton, was actually married! ' Murder will out ;' and so perhaps you will not write at all, but no, I'll not believe that. "Now Carrie, dearest, I cannot say that I am sorry, and will never do so again, for Frank's earnest eyes are upon me even while I write, and you know I never could resist their pleading. But I really am sorry for Aunt Dorathea, but what was I to do? She did not love me, she would not let me love her. I seemed to be the dark spot in the brightness of her sky, and perhaps now that it is removed she may be happier, but my vanity will scarcely let me think it. Well, the deed is done, and though Aunt Dorathea favored me with a sheet & four sides filled, decorated with wise sayings, such as " marry-   100       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. ing in haste, repenting, at leisure," which I will not inflict on you, I must confess that life seems very beautiful just now, and filled with hope for coming days. I wonder what dear Charlie will say. Do you think he will be very angry with his little Effie? This is the only fear that haunts me; but I shall win him too at last. I will- make him come to us in our New England home, simple though it be; I will call him to. our hearth at Thanksgiving's- happy time, for then all meet to- gether who are linked by the ties of kindred, and he is all that I can claim. "You can scarcely fancy me a housekeeper, but I assure you I am making great progress in the mystic arts thereunto attached, and a 'smile of approval is the only praise I covet. But I must tell you how snugly we are nestled in the valley of the Connecticut; so far from you, too, at the foot of Mount Holyoke, from whose summit a fair scene glads the eye. Ranges of hills in the distance covered with rich vegetation, and around and beneath, villages with their church spires looking to the blue heavens, and in the still evening the chime of their bells has a Sabbath sound for every heart. The town of N    is our world. Frank has procured a class at the seminary at Round Hill, and I do not think we need be discouraged at present. This is his native town; his parents live not many miles away, and our holidays are something to look forward to, for they will be passed at the farm. I stayed there some weeks with them, and to learn to love them was no difficult task. Wayward being that I was, coming to them under such circumstances, how could I expect such a kind welcome, much less that they should take me to their hearts, then and for aye. Carrie, darling, ought I to be sorry for lmy rash act, as Aunt Dorathea calls it? Give my love to your mother, and ask her if I ought. Don't forget me when you write to Gertrude, but do not ask her opinion ; how should she know? Frank, the tyrant, is taking my pen, so my next word must be--Good-bye.          EFPIE TRAVERS."

Quiet and unobtrusive as she was, yet her influence was felt by all, and day after day Henry watched her proudly and for dly, blessing her in his heart for the happiness she brought to each. Minnie Carleton, too, was yielding to her gentle sway. Minnie had been ill, very ill for long months, those who loved her watched tremblingly, lest the darkness which shrouded her mind should rest there forever.    They took her from  her home, from scene to scene; all that medical skill could sug- gest. or affection perform, was effected, but for a time it seem- ed of no avail. The fever which had borne her near to the confines of the grave passed, but left her mental and physical powers prostrate. It was sad to watch her weave for hours the flowers they brought her into wild fantastic wreaths, then scatter them   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        103 childishy on the ground; or turn unweariedly again and again to pages which surely had for her no meaning. But at last the love' and watch-care were repaid. Gradually light looked in on the darkened chambers of her soul, and I   once again she stood among them as awakened from a dream; and now indeed awake. It was long ere she realized that months had passed since she ceased to remember. She seldom questioned them, and all avoided speaking of her great affliction. But it was not without its use; it taught her to search her heart; to know herself; to feel how entirely His creatures are in the hands of k   an all-wise Creator. It taught her-how misused had been the WI  time and talents He had given, and deeply did she sorrow for i   the sinful and rebellious feelings to which she had yielded. t   Her affliction had been salutary. Renewed in strength and mind, she resolved to tread the path of duty, and devote her life to the doing of a Father's will. And in time, the ful- , ' filling of His promises brought to her heart a peace which it had never known, and life grew bright contrasted with the shadows of the past. She yielded no longer to vain repinings, striving always to remember blessings given, nor covet one withheld. She resolved to be useful to others, and with Lizzie's aid succeeded in establishing a school, to which they devoted their leisure hours, and which resulted in lasting benefit to many an immortal spirit. Minnie's life was happier, for she had become necessary to many, and in the performance of duties devolving on her she found an antidote for past sorrow. How glad was Walter's heart when they told him of the change, and many a kind and blessed thought winged its way to her, to guide and encourage her on this new-found path, scattering living flowerets there. And Gertrude, too, remembered her in love; the corre- spondence which for a time had ceased was joyfully resumed; and Carrie was winning her former place in Minnie's heart.  .              t   104       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. Thus the chain seemed link by link to be re-formed, which fate for a time had parted, and gladly they basked once more in the sun-light playing round them. To those whose eyes turn towards the "Sun of Righteous. ness," the severing of life's chain is but the forming of one more glorious, to be parted no more for ever. And thus it was to them but the transplanting of earth's flowers, when death's angel came into one dwelling and then another; when they missed a voice or called a name, which was not answered, be- cause it had been written anew on the records of immortality. And ofttimes the summons came so softly, they scarce deemed it death. And thus it seemed to those who still remained in Carrie Gilmer's home, when Uncle Jacob went away.   It seemed as though in weariness he had laid him down to rest, and fell asleep, for the quivering breath passed so gently they knew not it was gone. His last glance had been for Eulalie; her name the last upon his lips; his hand in death lay clasped in hers; his face was calm and peaceful as though an angel's kiss had left an impress there. And when they looked on the hushed form, ere the grave hid it, it was there still, and it seemed a sin to weep for one, who had exchanged earth's weary journeying for an eternal rest. His earthly possessions were but few, these he divided some months before he died, save the miniature of Eulalie; that he would not part with till towards the last. He called Mrs. Gilmer, and gave it to her, whispering, "Keep it till you come!" His little property was bequeathed to Carrie and Eulalie; it was but little, yet valuable to them, for it was the last gift of love. Among his secret treasures was a small medallion, with a long dark tress of hair, and on the boxrwhich contained them was written, "Eulie Gonzalo." These were left to Eula- lie, and as she pressed them to her lips tears filled her eyes, and she murmured, "Would, would that he had known it!" That name, that fair face pictured 'm the tiny case, strangely   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        105 thrilled her heart, for it was the name of her mother's only sis- ter; and as she placed beside it her mother's portrait, and S.

Not thus peacefully did he go to meet his Judge. Stern and cold in his life, winning none to love him, how should there be one voice to speak in kindness or one hand of affection to perform the last offices? He came back to his lordly home; whence he had driven the child of his dead brother, unchanged in purpose.    He knew that she was gone, yet asked no question, evinced no interest in her fate. Old Linda noted with indignation his indifference; and one unhappy day she gave vent to her anger, upbraiding him fiercely with the wrong he had done the help- less girl. She told him how his harshness had nearly sent her to the grave; told him of Mrs. Leslie's coming, and he heard her passively till then, but remained silent no longer. Rising, he pointed to the door, bidding her be gone, nor darken' it   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.       107 again by her unwelcome presence. Intimidated by his angry tone she withdrew, leaving him 'alone with his thoughts, and     very bitter they were. To think that she had been in his Ft  honme, the woman he once loved, who scorned him for a Leslie! How dared she enter there? But when he remembered, that under an assumed name he had sought to win her, he could no longer blame. She knew him not to be the same. But it i   soothed him not to know how his own rash act had defeated tr ,11 all his hopes. He had given Eulalie up, and to those for I    whom he had cherished an undying hatred, she was indebted !    for a home. He writhed beneath the blow his own hand had given. He would have recalled her, but pride forbade the thought. Time passed ; sumnmer and winter, and summer came again, and with it the breath of the pestilence floated o'er the land; from home to home, from heart to heart its summons sped; unsparing, unheeding prayers, and groans, and tears. Vic- timr after victim yielded to its sway; and its progress struck with panic the boldest and the strongest, the proudest and the best. Albert Raimlond saw and trembled; aye, mighty as he deemed himself, he looked upon its ravages with fear. He turned to the past, but its records presented dark pages of sinful years to his bewildered gaze; the present was dreary; no light upon his pathway; the future seemed a blank. He would fly while there was yet time; on the morrow he would go. But oh vain man, ;; boast not thyself of to-morrow!" for who can tell "what a day may bring forth?" In the midnight hour his summons came; he felt that the dread fiat had gone forth. His terrified attendants were around him, helpless and dismayed. What now to him were wealth and power? He would bar- ter all for life; but its sands were run out! Remorse seized him, he called for help, he spoke of Mr. Selden, and in haste they summoned him, but what hope had he to give, he who himself was hopeless, and unbelieving? He looked on the   108       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. agonized being before him, but a few hours since in possession of health and strength; he saw him nearing eternity, heard him pray for pardon, for succor and relief. The great reality of a future was opened to his view, and in his heart of hearts he felt, that this was the work of a just -God. In that dark and dreadful hour he witnessed the flitting of such a life, and knew that he had indeed been leaning upon broken reeds. Once in a transient moment of ease the dying man named Eulalie, imploring her to forgive him. "Take all," he said, "all that I have is thine, but oh forgive me!" He knew not that her gentle nature harbored no unkind. thought even to him. Mr. Selden remained until he found that he could not be of service, then left him, for his duty called him elsewhere. The next day dawned brightly on the earth, but its light came not to the eyes of Albert Raimond. Edward Selden looked on him ere they hastily consigned him to his last home, and the lesson he had received at his dying bed never left him. Death comes to all, but not to all the doom, to walk alone through the dark valley, for with the righteous goeth the " pre- sence of one like unto the Son of God." ?   CHAPTER XXVI. "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, but the word of our God shalt stand forever P" "The melody is full and sweet, We cannot all its folds unwind, Or count the harmonies that meet In that one strain combined. But eyer on the spirit's ear, T These accents with the cadence fall: God rules by love, He rules by fear; God's love is over all!" IT was in that summer time that Eulalie Raimond dwelt for a time with Gertrude Weston. They would detain her no longer at Mr. Gilmer's, for though they Iled her gentle pre- sence, they felt it but right to share theiraim with others Mrs. Weston welcomed her warmly, her heartas      irresistibly drawn toward  the orphan  friend, of her darli g    child.  The little Lucy loved her too, and Eulalie returne   her childish affection with deep and earnest interest. They had lingered one evening longer than      as their wont beside the pastor's grave, for though the  good  man  had long since gone to his rest, his memory was still cherished, and the holy spot which shrined his sleeping dust was a frequent and well beloved resort.   "O       SUNBEAMS ANm SHADOWS. The evening shadows were gathering ere they returned, and Mrs. Weston gently chided their delay, for Eulahe was still fragile, and those who loved her feared lest the seal of the destroyer should be early set on this most beautiful of earth's frail clay. As time passed she had become lovelier than in her brighest days of pride; for the Spirit's light beamed purified from her dark eyes, and there was a calm and loving radiance on her face that seemed to speak of heaven and its blessings. She was passing fair, and those who knew her not oft turned for another glance at the fair sweet face of Gertrude's friend. She had learned to prize the talents so assiduously culti- vated as the gift of God, and, seeking his aid, strove to de- vote them to the promotion of His honor and glory; for she felt that as to her much had been given, of her much would also be required. On the evening alluded to, Lucy pleaded for some music. "I do so love to hear it, these still nights," she said; '* so come, Miss Eulie, you must not shake your head, but look into mamma's eyes, they are asking for the same, and I know you cannot resist her." "I sing very seldom now, Lucy, my 'music nighlts,' as you call them, are with the things of long ago, which make me sad to remember." She followed Lucy to the instrument, and running her fingers lightly over the keys, commenced a soft sweet prelude, and then the voice which had so often thrilled in festive hours the heart of the gayest, now rose sweet and clear, gaining strength and melody, as she sang at the child's bidding one of her later lays :- When the darkness gathers 'round us When the sunshine's lost in night, Turn we trustingly to heaven, Where our Father dwells in light.   SUlNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. When the forms we love pass from us, And the hearts we prized estranged, There is One who ne'er foreaketh, One whose love has never changed. Let us trust Him then to guide us, -He our timid steps will keep, And His presence shall go with us Till we lay us down to'sleep. Let us love Him then for ever, Praying for the loved who roam, That His hand may gently bring them All to meet il His bright home." 'Twas a simple strain, yet it spoke to hearts they only thought of, as away. There was a   murmuring sound of voices without, and as the last note was hushed Mr. Duncan entered, and with him came a stranger, and yet not such to all, for Eulalie sprang forward, and with a bright smile gavehber hand to his proffered greeting, and with a joyous exclamation welcomed him. Mr. Selden, is it really you ?" "Indeed, Miss Raimond," he replied, I am half inclined to doubt m   y own identity, since my old friends do not re og- niz e me ;" and he looked reproachfully at Gertrude. xForgive m e," she rep lied, , but I was so surprised," and with a gentle dignity she made him welcome and presented him to her mother. T  o th e little group there assembled that was an eventful h  our, for he was the bearer of strange tidings. Gently he unfolded-to Eulalie the events of the past weeks, and as he spoke of her uncle's death she wept bitterly; for cold and harsh as he had been , her father had loved himr and 10now he wa s in the grave, and left , alas ! no hope in h is d eath to "heer the living, and yet withal a feeling of gratitude thrilled   "2       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. her heart as Mr. Selden proceeded; for the father of the fatherless had been mindful of her, alone as she seemed, and again placed her in the possession of wealth, of which; for His own good purposes, He had for a time deprived her. And she breathed an earnest prayer that night that He would teach her to use it aright. The guests lingered until the lateness of the hour com- pelled them to say " good night." They retired, but not to rest, for thought was busy, and wild sweet dreams of the future, blending with the past, yet colored by the present, came to more than one, and the night was far spent, ere these waking visions were forgotten in the dream-land. Mr. Selden, at parting, had spoken that to Gertrude which sent the crimson-tide to her cheek, and a light to her eye; and her smile seemed almost holy as she answered, "I do in- deed rejoice with you."   i B. ';1 CHAPTER XXVII. - He told of a time that now was past, He told of the hope which cine at last; And they went on their way with trusting hearts, And a faith which no after knowledge parts." WHO is yon fair lady?" asked Mr. Selden of Gertrude, as they stood at the gate, prepared for a summer ramble. Miss Glenn," replied Gertrude, smiling, an old school- mate of ours, but I refer you to Eulalie for further informa- tion, as she actually called on her, a condescension to which I was not entitled!" "She is singular looking, rather distingu-," remarked Sel- den, but her expression  is too scornful to awaken much !  "Beware, boastful sir, " said Eulie, " you speak unwittingly, oshe isthe belle of the 1town, the heiress; her virtues are golden, as I heard some say the other day ;" but she added more seriously, "I pity her, for I fear she is about to become the victim of a fortune-hunter, and little cause as I have to admire her, I should regret to hear of her marriage with that fierce looking Don Whiskerando, whose name I can never remember. Poor Helen!, Lucy came   to meet them, and they turned their thoughts to  brighter things, and with a smiling good-bye to Mr. Wes-   "4       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.- ton went on their way with brighter hearts than the subject of their discourse had ever known. "Now Gertrude, I have told you all," said Edward Selden. He had turned to the past, and its revealings. He told of the restless unhappiness which had followed him since they parted; of the earnest pleadings of conscience, how he had resisted them, and sometimes succeeded in banishing better thoughts, but to return with new power. And finally, of the visitation which had forced him to acknowledge, trem- blingly, the existence of a Deity; and as he painted scenes of horror he had witnessed, Gertrude shuddered to think of all he had escaped, and blest the hand which had preserved in the midst of danger, and more than all, the' power which had brought him to the knowledge of himself. "All hope of winning you," he added, " had long ago for- saken me, for not even that blest boon ever tempted me to deceive you or myself. But now that light has come to me also, you will not send me from you sorrowing as once you did, but we will learn together of Him who is meek and lowly of heart;"'" and drawing from his bosom the little Testament which Euhe had given him, he read the words which she had traced there, saying, ' I trust that prayer has not been vain. I read it now not lightly, I hope, but earnestly desiring to know aright the words of eternal life.' "Loiterers that you are," was heard in Eulalie's sweet voice. "Remember we are far from home, and see how Lucy and I have enriched ourselves while you were idling here,". and she shared with them the bright blossoms, of which a sick boy once said, "Bring me some wild flowers, mother. for God made them all himself, He takes care of them, and no one helps him." They turned their steps homeward, and there was joy in Gertrude's heart, and strengthened trust in Him, who is "4 bet- ter to us than all our fears." And when in the village church she saw Edward Selden bow the knee in prayer, and heard   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.       115 his voice blend with the hymn of the worshippers, tears trem- bled in her eyes, but they were tears of gladness. It was not long ere Edward Selden asked of Mrs. Weston the brightest boon she could bestow, and, with confiding trust, she promised to yield to his keeping the child of many hopes, her dearest care. She should not be parted, he said, from Gertrude, she would but win another child, for their home should be hers, even as now her God was his. The light comes in fitful gleams to earth; it is only the light of heaven, which, (when purified by afflictions sent from thence) beams on us in glory ever, unchanging, pure and bright!   CHAPTER XXVIII. w4 And they are joined, for woe or weal; The ' man of God ' the words hath spoken; The talismanic, whose seal May now alone by Death be broken." VERY lovely was Gertrude Weston, when robed for the bridal, and yet on some of the young faces round her in her pleasant chamber, there was a shade of thoughtfulness scarce in accord- ance with the hour. Eulahe had placed the last snowy buds in her dark hair, and pressed a kiss on her brow, yet tears glistened in her eyes, for both thought of one who should have been among them, the gayest of the group, but of her they had heard sad tidings; Carrie Gilmer, for whose coming Ger- trude had so earnestly pleaded, was ill; she could no longer conceal it from those who loved her. A cold, for a time ne- glected, had resulted seriously, and it was feared by her phy- sicians that the beautiful and well-beloved would fall a victim to the hereditary malady of her mother's family; Gertrude's marriage, an event to which she had always looked forward so hopefully, was about to be celebrated, and it was a source of regret, to be separated at such a time; but it could not be otherwise, and Eulalie, at her request, took her place as bridemaid, subdued almost to sadness by such memo- ries.   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        17 "7 But youthful hearts are buoyant, and hope for the future robs the present of its darkness. The solemn rite which gave Gertrude to Edward Selden was over, the benediction pronounced in Walter's trembling voice, and friends gathered around the bride with many fervent wishes for her happiness. And many grieved to part with one who had ever been to the needy a friend, a solace in afflic- tion's hour. They went forth amid blessings and farewells, and Ger- trude looked back, smiling through tears, to meet once more her mother's lingering glance. They contemplated making a tour northward, ere they made arrangements for their final departure. And in compli- ance with Carrie's request, they were to remain, on their re- turn, a few days at Mr. Gilmer's. Gertrude was very, very happy; her dearest hopes, which she had deemed early blighted, were more than realized. She had trusted in One who had cared for her; One, who in temp- tation's hour had strengthened though He chastened. And now she felt that all things had indeed worked together for good.  New duties now devolved upon her; she felt their im-p portance, but still she feared not, for he who was now her earthly guiding star would be near to aid her, and to share alike her joys or griefs. They were a happy party, a group an artist might have loved to picture. Gertrude, with her earnest glance, turned so confidingly on  Mr. Selden as he would point out some new feature in the d varied landscape, and comment on its beauty in his thrilling tones; and Eulalie, so bright and beautiful, gazed on them in their happiness, her expressive features changing with the speaker's mood. They had been tried by suffering, young as they were, but they had grown wiser and better, and though the time to come might have deeper grief in store, yet they would only drink the cup together, trusting 'to One who had never failed them in the past. They looked on life as a dream, in kjr   "8        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. which the lights and shadows strangely met, from which if they would awaken its sun should set on them for ever; and while they strove not to repine when the shadows fell upon them, dimming their joy, they received with gratitude the light and blessings which God sent them. There was another bridal that same day, and mirth and festivity followed in its train.. The gay and the wealthy were bidden to the festival; for Helen Glenn the heiress was to wed with one who was thought to be nobly born, and a possessor of broad lands. The face of the fair Helen wore a haughtier expression than was its wont, and her heart exulted in the dazzling pros- pects which seemed opening before her.   But, alas for those who teach the young to bow at worldly shrines, and fos- ter the growth of pernicious plants, in hearts naturally prone to evil!  Alas for them, for the deluded victims! Poor Helen's bark sped gayly on for a brief season, but when the- tempest came, there was no pilot's hand to guide it through the stormy waters. While wealth was hers, flatterers smiled and fawned upon her; but when the companion she had chosen for life proved how false such faith, how fleeting love like his could be; when he gained possession of the wealth for which he had wooed her, then the friends of her prosperous days forsook her, and she was alone, for he had gone she knew not whither. In her sunny hours she had scorned and repulsed true friendship, so now there were but few to pity, or to aid her in her need. She died as she had lived, unloving and un- loved; and her memory, if recalled by those with whom she- had mingled in earlier days, woke at most a sigh for her weak- ness and folly. ' As ye sow, so shall ye reap," is the prophecy of Holy Writ, and daily, nay even hourly, those words seem verified in the histories of our fellow-mortals.   CHAPTER XXIX. i"She left the bright rose blooming fair And came again within an hour, Alas! the rude winds had been there, And with'ring was the cherished flower. 'Tis vain to place the trusting heart, Ou joys but for the moment given - 'Twere wise to choose the better part And fix the hopes on endless heaven!" A LETTER from Gertrude to her mother was hailed with joy, yet it bore tidings which Mrs. Weston made known in part to W  alter Duncan, and which though he neither knew nor feared the truth, caused him anxiety and sorrow. "My heart sinks within me," she wrote "when I    think of our darling Carrie. I strove to control my feelings, and con- ceal my surprise, at the fearful change in her since we parted. Eulahe was so overcome that she could not restrain her tears, but wept aloud when she met her. It was, however, attributed tothe sad events which have of late occurred, and while they essayed to calm her, she recovered herself, glad that her emo- tion had not been imputed to the true cause. "Carrie's cough is at times distressing, and her wasted form and the hectic flush on her cheek are to me sad, sad   120       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. tokens. She is, however, gayer even than of old, and her fond parents gaze on her with delight, and take such pleasure in her lively sallies. They seem perfectly unconscious of danger, and Carrie says it is merely a cold, which will pass away be- fore the winter. Eulalie tells me that on the morning after our arrival, she went into her room and found her greatly exhausted, having passed such a restless night, but she appear- ed at breakfast an hour or two later in the gayest mood, and none would have thought that she had been suffering so greatly. "We deviated somewhat from the usual route, and paid a flying visit to my old acquaintance Effie. Edward heard that a friend, whom he had not seen for many years, resided in N    ,so we turned our steps thither.  Effie seemed half wild with joy. She did not recognize me at first, but when I spoke, her arms were about my neck, and a kiss of welcome on my cheek. She presented me to her husband, with a fond, proud glance, which spoke volumes. They seemed to be quite comfortable, though living plainly, and Effie told me that they were obliged to use economy, for Frank's health was not so good as it had been. Miss Clinton, she said, had never noticed or aided them in any way since their marriage, but she added, in her own hopeful way, ' Charlie will soon re- turn, and then all will be right again.' 'l She seemed much affected when I spoke of Carrie, and won- dered if they should ever meet again. I bade her adieu with regret. There is much in her character to admire, though for want of judicious training, her naturally amiable disposition is-much changed, and as she has never been taught the neces- sity of self-control, the consequences of her impulsive acts will, I fear, lead to difficulties." It was in the last autumn month that Mrs. Weston and Lucy prepared to accompany Gertrude to her southern home. There were many associations calculated to make her depar- ture sorrowful; true, there were no ties to be sundered, for she had lived much secluded; but the place which for years   I ,i .SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.                121  : has been our home, becomes dear to us. The scenes of other days come up so vividly in turning from it, it may be to return no more) that we cannot but sigh to know them gone-all gone. But her children were her world, and they were still beside her, ever watchful to anticipate her lightest wish, and in their happiness she found her pleasure.,  Eulalie, whose presence was required in New Orleans, was obliged again to leave her friend, whose disease seemed to have gained new power, and they pleaded with Mrs. Gilmer to bear them company, hoping that a milder clime would benefit their child. The physicians urged her removal, but entreaties were vain. Carrie, hopefully clinging to life, laughed at their fears nor heeded their prayers. She knew she was not so ill as they said, and if she was, she preferred her home to any other spot on the green earth. "Carrie always had her way," her mother said, and she did not fail to win it now. The travellers folded her slight form  in a long and fond embrace, and wept with bitter tears, to think it might be-even the last! 1  '                            , -        6   CHAPTER XXX. "Look on her eyes, with what a beam of sadness do they shine, And see her fair transparent cheek, soft, shaded with carmine; She'll fade like all things beautiful, around this world of woe, Which seem most precious at the time, when they from us must go." WEEKS and months passed on, and alternate hope and fear swayed the hearts of those who watched Carrie with an agonizing solicitude. For a time she had rallied, and seem- ed to be regaining strength daily, but the changes peculiar to her disease awakened hopes but to crush them, still more painfully. The spring  returned again, but Carrie revived not with the flowers that heralded its approach.  She seemed impatient for Eulalie's return, whose stay was unexpectedly prolonged, and they wrote to speed her on her way, eager to gratify any wish expressed by the sufferer. Mrs. Leshe was with her, watching her with tender care, soothing her so gently, striving gradually to prepare her for the change which awaited her.  It was a trial she had already undergone, and she could sympathize with the anguish of the parents, not as one who was a stranger to sorrow, for she had laid her own fair child in the cold grave; and often as she looked on Carrie so lovely, yet fading thus away, she would   - t":      SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        123 leave her side to conceal the tears that she could not re. press. Leshe had returned, and impatiently awaited Eulalie's coming, yet he too devoted himself to the sick girl, and strove, with the kindness of a brother, to amuse or interest her. He would seek the earliest buds of spring to fill her vases, and, as long as she was able to leave her room, he would read until she grew weary, then speak to her of his travels, and recall incidents, which would sometimes win her for a while to her old spirit of mirthfulness. There was no hope for her; the young, the beautiful, the idolized. No hope! The dreaded words had been spoken. The heart-stricken father hushed his agony, and buriet it in his own breast, for how could he tell the mother that their child must die!-their only child!-the being who made life so bright; without whose smile the earth would seem a desert. He would steal to her side in the night-watches, and gaze on, her sweet pale face, in her troubled slumber; and he who had never prayed before, bowed his trembling knees, and sent up an anguished supplication, that his child might live; but as he turned from her, ever and anon, came up that hope- less sound-': She too must die!" And yet she seemed so little conscious of the truth, and there were none who dared to speak to her the fearful words. Mrs. Leslie sat beside her one evening while she slept; so still and hushed was her repose, she seemed a statue sculp- tured there, but for the soft tint on her cheek. Eulahe had arrived, and looked on her as she dreamed, but, unable to control her emotion, left the room, fearing to disturb her. Ere she returned Carrie awoke, and, with a sweet smile, laid her hand in Mrs. Leslie's; and told her she had been far i-t away in thought. "I dreamed, dear Mrs. Leslie, of being at [il school once more; they were all with me, but now-they who loved me in those happy days-now it is so changed. I would s'   124       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. I had slept on; they are all--all gone! But Eulie must come soon." "She is here even now, dearest," and with an exclamation- of joy Carrie strove to rise, but she was too weak, and Eulie pressed her lips on cheek and brow, and laid her gently down again, and from that time, not even Ellerton Leslie could per- suade her to leave her station, save when Carrie slept. "Mother: darling mother, send for Walter," said she one day, " and let it be quickly." And Walter came, in brokenness of heart, to see his earthly treasure fast wearing away. It, was a bitter cup to take, and yet he dared not murmur, for a Father's hand prepared it, and he prayed in earnestness of spirit for strength to say, "Thy will be done!"He must look upon the ravages disease had made, and calming his struggling heart, nerve himself to fulfil his Master's will, and gently lead her to the fold of the Great Shepherd! It was a painful duty he felt to be devolving on him now, the deepest sorrrow that he had yet known. But he who loved the gentle girl, loved also that immortal part, which must live on for ever, and he could not let her pass from earth, nor point her to the cross. He told her of the love which redeemed ; of the Saviour who died to save; of the endless bliss of heaven,. where none but the pure in heart might dwell. He prayed earnestly and touchingly in her behalf, and urged'her to think of the better, land, where a mansion was prepared for her, not made with hands. At first she listened wonderingly, and then with a sad re- proachful look, would turn from him, refusing to hear his words. "I cannot, cannot die, though you so easily can give me up ;" she would answer, "I cannot die!" and then, seeing how deeply Walter was pained, she would weep, and beg him to forgive her. Unweat sdly, day after day, did he continue to plead for,   :I           SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.         125 and with, this object of their deep devotion, and though his voice oft faltered, and tears of agony welled up, still he ceased not; and God blessed his efforts; listened to his prayers, and prepared the soul tpl pass fearlessly through " death's dark valley." I i   CHAPTER XXXI. "And we shall meet There, my own love, to part no more; And low, and sweet, Mother, thy voice upon that shore   i'" Will softly come, And I shall meet those mild dark eyes As, in this home, They beam like light from summer skies. 'Tis well to die, Here in this pleasant even-tide Thus happily To pass from thy dear faithful side, But bear thou up, And humbly kiss the chastening rod, This bitter cup." WALTER'S task was accomplished; he had his reward; and now that the heart had been won at last to God, his strengtl for a time seemed to fail him, and earthly love warred witl feelings which must now be all subdued and fixed on heaven It was touching to mark   the change in Carrie.   Alway, lovely and beloved, yet in her last h/ours she became more deal to those from whom she was about to pass. It was a touching sight to see her with a hand clasped ir her mother's  and her fond gaze fixed upon her, while sh( whispered  of the new-found   love and  peace which  could brighten such an hour. . She would fondly twine her arm, about Eulalie, kiss her again and again, and beg of her to be   - - .         SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        127 a daughter to those who would be so soon childless. It was now her turn to pour consolation into Walter's aching heart: and with gentleness she would thank him for the faith which he had taught her, and whisper of a meeting that should be for ever. She thought of all; left some kindly message, some fare- well-token for each. She lingered for weeks longer than they had hoped, and towards the last her sufferings seemed mitigated. She faded as the evening light from the summer sky. It was a calm, bright eve in May. Eulahe had been sitting by her, and Ellerton Leshe had been admitted at her request, for she felt it would not be long, she said. She looked long and earnestly from him to Eulalie, and seemed to be thinking deeply; at last she motioned Eulie to come nearer, and whis- pered in her ear. Eulie started back, bewildered and distress- ed. "Oh no, Carrie, it cannot, cannot be; I beg you, dear- est, do not ask it." "It will be so gratifying to me," replied Carrie, and she called Mrs. Leslie to join her entreaties to her own; and as her sweet voice spoke in the stillness, so clear were its tones that it thrilled on the ear long after it was hushed for ever. ": Dear Mrs. Leslie," shesaid, "I fear, when I am gone, that Eulie will turn from happiness, in her sorrow for me. I would not have her grieve that I am happy. I would see her given to Ellerton now, lest in her deep affection she should indeed come to take my place, as I so often asked. But that must not be, for even when you are her mother, she will not forget to care for mine. It is my last request, dearest Eulie," and she placed the hand of the weeping girl in that of Ellerton. '  -Sunset deepened into twilight; the darkness came on, and in that still chamber were assembled a strange group. Fair as the flowers that shed their fragrance near her, and yet doomed to pass ere their short lives were told, Carrie  Gilmer, supported by pillows, looked anxiously on her friend,   128       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. the dear companion of her childhood, who, at her bidding, amid tears and sobs, was plighting her faith to one to whom it had been pledged in happier hours. A venerable minister had been summoned to perform the ceremony, and when it was ended they knelt around the couch of the dying, and a touching petition went up to heaven, ere the pure spirit took its flight. Walter remained on his knees beside the bed, his head bowed upon his hands, and the burning tears fell fast upon the hand so fondly clasped in his. The hour that made Eulalie Raimond a wife, brought deep sorrow to a stricken band. The summons so long dreaded, came suddenly at last.  Carrie appeared stronger than she had been for days, but seem- ing to grow weary, she put her arm around her mother's neck, and laying her head on her bosom, fell asleep. A solemn still- ness reigned around, and though tears were dimming many an eye, not a sound escaped the mourners. She slept not long, but awoke with a troubled expression on her face, but it passed quickly, and looking around on the dear group, smiled, as Wal- ter came and pressed his lips on her cold cheek. She laid her hand in his, and looking upward, while a gleam of sudden light seemed to irradiate her countenance, she murmured Fa- ther! Mother! dear ones!  Oh) Walter, 'tis all bright, all and her voice failed there; a quivering sigh, and it was over. Carrie was at rest. In her youthful loveliness she had joined the angel throng, of whom it is written, "They shall be ministering spirits, to minister unto us who shall be heirs of salvation." Mrs. Gilmer was carried insensible from the beauteous clay, now all unconscious of her mother's wild heart-rending grief Dark, dark, and dreary seemed the dwelling whence its bright- est light was fled, and Walter Duncan shut himself in his chamber, and prayed, as he had never prayed before, that the God with whom she now dwelt, would sustain him in that try-    SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.        129 ing hour. And he went forth more calm, to take his station once more by her side, feeling that the casket alone was there; yet still precious to the stricken heart. Beautiful in life, so was she lovely, even though tte death seal was upon her brow. They strewed the brightest flowers above her, ere they carried her from the home she had so blest. The memory of that still sweet face, on which a smile lin- gered, long dwelt with those who came to look upon it ere the grave won her. A simple tablet was placed above her, and the inscription, - "Carrie Gilmer, aged 19," arrested the attention of many a lin- gerer mid the homes of the dead. A few touching lines, affection's last tribute, from Eulalic's pen, were graved there too; and years after, a shadowy form might be seen bending o'er them, reading, through blinding tears, what had long ago been written on her heart. And the children would whisper to each other, It was her only child." And this was her daily pilgrimage, but not long; for she, too, was called to dwell with loved ones gone before; and they who ::-- loved together here were gathered round the throne of Him who reigns in heaven, " to go no more out for ever." "Now, mother, dear," we pleaded, brushing away the tears that would come unbidden, " now, mother, we have read it all, dear Aunt Minnie's manuscript, and we know you for sweet ]:; Lizzie Reed, but tell us of the rest. Who was Walter? Have we seen him?   Tell us all, dear mother, and coaxingly press-  "i  ing her hand to my lips I felt privileged, as the eldest to insist on what was the wish of all. ":,  Tears trembled in our mother's eyes as she looked fondly on us, thinking on past scenes. "Do you not remember," she '  said, " one came here long ago, when you were quite a child, ::  who remained but a short time, when your father was so ill? !!f 'Have you forgotten the Bible that he left for Carrie? ' j"!   "Yes, yes, dear mamma. I know now; for when he came  i-   130       SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. to see us, he took Carrie in his arms, and blessed her, and when he kissed her and went away, I am sure that there were tears upon her cheek. I remember, now, he looked so good, and spoke so gently. Yes, that was Walter. Oh, mamma, if he had known Aunt Minnie as we did, he must have loved her at last." .      "I Could you have known Carrie Gilmer, my daughter, you would not wonder that her image could not be banished from his heart to shrine another's there." "And Effie, mamma, the merry Effie, did you know her, too?" And Gertrude, and Eulalie, where are they all?" "Some, my love, are now at rest! Effie's life was short, and not all joyous; her aunt forgave her, only on her death- bed, and but for her brother Charles, she had been destitute. "Her little daughter died soon after, so I know not if any who were connected with her yet remain. ' Gertrude still lives ; you have often met with her, and if I mistake not, love her well. Who is it speaks so gently to my wayward child, appeasing her troubles, when even her mo- ther's voice has failed to soothe?" ' Oh! I know it all now, and Eulalie is her dearest friend; the names differ, but I recognize them both, and when I go to the villa again, I shall surprise them all, if I mistake not. But it might make them sad. I wonder if I shall ever meet with joys and sorrows such as theirs, and I wonder if our dar- ling Carrie will ever prove as lovely as her namesake?" "I fear, my child, you will have many trials, should your life be spared, but if you give your young heart to Him who seeks it, His grace shall sustain you through all, and the light afflidtions of earth ' work for us a far more exceeding and eter- nal weight of glory.

BY-GONE HOU RS. "'Tis sad, 'tis sad to number o'er The faces glad and gay, Which we have loved; some come no more Around us as they did of yore, And some have turned away. THE song is hushed, its echoes long since past; but round my heart its memory lingers still-waking deep thoughts of other days, of other years. "By-gone hours! How fraught with many a history their record comes to me; how full of joy, and yet of sorrow! She who sang the touching lay recalled them all; the bright, the beautiful, the loved of many hearts, was alive then; the child of fortune, the darling of the world. But her soul yearn- ed for nobler joys than earth can give; she looked to the fat off heaven, where our Father dwells, and prayed for the I peace which passeth understanding ;' the happiness which never dies; and in the sunlight of youth she dedicated herself to the ser- vice of God. She went on her way rejoicing. Her name is cherished in the hearts of the desolate; and her beauty, a star of hope and joy, illumines their homes; and when her life's last hour shall come, even in the dark valley, this sweet as- surance shall go with her-' She hath not lived in vain!' "Those by-gone hours!"With them have passed bright spirits from the earth, that, like them, are remembered still. When the old familiar faces gather round the Christmas hearth; when the old homestead echoes to the music of young happy voices; ever and anon we turn from their light to the dim past, seeking for those whose places there are vacant. We miss them, and yet we would not turn from aught that calls them to our mind; for like whispers from the better land, their parting blessing thrills our hearts, and a holy influence rests   SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS.         133 upon our spirits, when we remember that the chain so broken here is linked in heaven; that sad as we often seem, and lonely, we are allied to angels. The spirits of the blest may still be watching o'er us, and it is sweet to think, ' They love us yet! "Those 'by-gone hours!' I heard the strain from lips of song; and those who knew her not might have thought it found an echo in the singer's heart. and even watch for a tear- ful eye, meet for the melody of sadness. But she who sang was joyous as the wild bird on the wing, as free from care, almost a child, and yet a promised bride. But who may read to-morrow?    The light faded fromn her eye, and the lips were sealed ere those vows were spoken. The nlusic of life was lost in the requiem for the early dead. The voice of the pestilence was heard in the land; the young and light-hearted trembled at its summons, and bowed to its behest. The shadow fell on a happy tome, With the fair and joyous morn, But ere the star-light passed away The treasure of home was gone. Whene'er I listen to that olden Strain, my heart grows sad, to think  upon the many  gathered to the tomb; but there is sunshine with the shade; smiles blended with our tears; that tell of life land beauty still. The buds of 'by- gone hours' have blossomed gloriously; the hopes of other years have not all vanished; some  looks we loved to meet are changed; some  hearts we called our own, estranged ; but the path of life is brightened by friendships of youth matured; the love of childhood grown  fonder, as the day wears on, and many a blessing spared softens the grief for those 'gone, not lost; passed, not forgotten." There is much of the past I   love to remember; visions   134        SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. of blessedness, pointing to the future of eternity, when hope which have their dawning here, shall win reality of life ; whi those who have gone before shall greet us; when we shE drink of the water of life, and never die; when God sht wipe away all tears from  our eyes,' and make us blest f evermore!" II EVENING.  THE blue stream is singing A lullaby sweet, The flowers are bending Each whisper to meet. The wild birds are winging Away to their home, Earth's voices are blending Jn one joyous tone. A tone that swells higher As sinketh the sun, Ascending to heaven jWhen -earth-work is done. When the toil of the day Is forgotten in rest, When the heart for its blessings The Giver has blest, Our Father in heaven Waiteth to hear The prayers of His children Breathed in His ear. The eye that ne'er sleepeth Watches o'er all The works of his fingers When night shadows fall.   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS, SEQUEL TO SUNBEAMS AND SHADOWS. Buds of my  earlier, happier years, Telling of summer gone, Send forth wet with memry's tears Unto each happy home. Buds, garnered long ago, and kept Where sacred things remain; Buds that I  loved, and watched, and blest, But now I   seek in vain. No, not in vain, for where He dwells Who lent them to earth's love; Brighter, and fadeless are enshrined Blossom and bud above.      I look back upon the lapse of years now that my cheek hath furrows, not all indeed of time, and my eyes dimmed by many a tearful vigil. I look back to the days gone by with melan- choly fondness, and I turn again and again to the pages where- on Aunt Minnie traced so long ago the events of her own changeful existence; and around me come at eventide, or in the still hours of night, the joyous band who read them once with me. They come-but as in dreams, for with daylight do they vanish, and I am left once more alone. Alone! for I have laid my own bright darlings where flowers spring up the lightest, where the summer sun shines brightest o'er their place of rest. It is a strange yearning which is in my heart e'en now. A voice is in my ear bringing up the past so vividly to view, and its tones are ever whispering, "Do you remember?" Aye, well do I remember, and ere I go to rest, where those I love are waiting, I will write on other hearts records of those as joyous, once as glad and gay; hearts whose beatings now are stilled. I will call back bird-like voices long since hushed; for I would be remembered when my own hath ceased, though none save strangers may remain to think of me in kindness. I would be regretted, though tears should fall from eyes into whose light my own have never looked!   *   -? BUDS AND BLOSSOMS, CHAPTER L "We know when moons shall wane, When summer birds from far shall cross the sea, When autumrnn's hue shall tinge the golden grain, But who shall teach us when to look for thee I Is it when spring's first gale Comes forth to whisper where the violets lie 7 Is it when roses in our path grow pale? They have one season-all are ours to die!" HEMANS. AN awed and tearful group were in that quiet chamber sum- moned hastily to witness   the 'spirit's passing of one who, a few brief hours before, had looked out on the summer's light with a hopeful heart, and an eye that watched the coming of hap- pier to-morrows.  But alas for mortal strength, or pride, or hope!   One touch of the Almighty finger, and who shall find al trace?  One word-and the casket hath no jewel-the soul no earthly shrine! The crimson tide welling forth from the half-closed lips,   "O.        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. told of the death-angel's wing hovering o'er an earthly dwell- ing. Human skill was vain, love and tears were powerless to save. A band of young fair children wept, and prayed beside the mother who had so loved, and blest, and guided them; whose gentle words might never more make answer in their home, whose fond and loving glance would soon be turned front them for ever. "Gertrude!" at last the faint voice murmured; and Ger- trude Selden knelt beside Lizzie Reed of olden time, and sought to read in the troubled glance the heart's deep mean- ing. She turned her dim eyes toward her treasures, and tried to lay her hand upon the young head nestled near her. "You will speak of them Lizzie," Gertrude answered. "They shall not be forsaken;"God will teach us to care for the fatherless-fear not for them." "Lizzie," said a voice familiar to her girlhood, " my home is lonely, for -childhood's mirth is wanting. Will you not leave to my love and care one treasure to be cherished there?" A light of joy came o'er the pallid features, and -the trem- bling hand sought the clasp of Eulalie's, then laid it on the darling by her side. Sunset faded, twilight passed, and in the deep and silent night, the spirit was released: and Lizzie Duncan numbered among those who sing in joy the strains of the redeemed. She had gone to dwell with him, whose path she brightened, whose earthly home she shared-with God, whose love had given, who also had taken away ; with God, whose eye is over all for good; who hath promised to be '"The Father of the fatherless-a help in every time of need." It was a touching sight to see those young heads bowed beside the cold and cherished form, which would soon be taken from their sight. It was sad to see them clinging to each other, and looking up to her, who, though the eldest, could not give them comfort now, for she was doubly desolate. She had thought it agony enough to see the father's head laid low; to   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        141 miss him daily in their home; but oh, darker, sadder far the 'hour that left them motherless. Helplessly she looked upon the children, striving to think of God and Heaven, of that dear mother's home, but when she thought the tide of grief was stayed, and would have spoken soothing words, the pent-up agony burst forth anew. and she could only remember, that she and they were left alone. When all indeed was over, the last sad rite performed; when but an added mound in the little grave-yard gave token of a vacant place at home; when Lizzie Duncan returned to the darkened house, and sought her mother's room to weep in desolation of spirit, she was not long alone, for a kind arm en- circled her, and the voice which had so often soothed tha/t mo- ther's lonely girlhood, poured balm into her aching heart. Long and tenderly Gertrude talked to the stricken child, and pointed her to Him who alone sustains the bruised reed, and soothes and heals earth's smitten ones. She touched, but oh, so gently,the chord vibrating now so sadly; spoke of her own mother, still loved, still wept for, not with murmuring tears, grief which turns from the comforter; but, chastened and subdued, she thought of her as one whom God had taken. Gradually her listener grew calmer, promising to heed her kindly counsel, to strive to fill, in love, a mother's place to one who -could scarcely feel or know how great a blessing she had lost-the little Lena. Gertrude's good-night kiss was pressed lovingly on each fair brow, as she left the sleepers, though the tears still glis- tened on the heavy lashes, and ever and anon a sigh would heave some dreamer's breast as she bent over them. It is a dreary feeling which comes over us on the (first awakening after sorrow. Bewildering memories, which we would fain believe but dreams, crowd on us, but when the sad reality comes with its crushing weight, the heart sinks, and the brain reels beneath the pressure. Life seems a weariness we would fain cast off, and the green earth a desert or a tomb.   "2        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.  Thus it was with Lizzie Duncan, when the morning sunlight looked in on her, and glanced as brightly on the resting place so newly made, not far away, and it was long ere she could look on it again, or remove the clasped hands which would fain shut it out. But she knew it was not well to yield thus to the sway of grief, and for the sake of those whom she must henceforth guard and guide, strove to regain composure. She aroused her young sisters from their unconscio is sleep, and tried to talk with them calmly, though each heart was full to overflowing, and on each tongue trembled a name they dared not speak. "Sister," said Lena, opening the door of the deserted sit- ting-room, which Lizzie was trying to restore to its wonted order, "Harry Selden is coming; see, what beautiful flowers he brought me." He entered even as she spoke, and, with a kind greeting, gave his mother's message, who had desired him to await her coming. It was not long ere Gertrude joined them, and urged the orphans to return with her. "Edward says you must all come," she pleaded. "He is much better to-day, and anxiously watches for you. Nay, you must not say a word, Lizzie; I have ordered the carriage to meet me within the hour, and henceforth my homne is to be yours." A lovely, group watched the setting sun that summer's eve, from the terrace of Glenwood. A bright secluded spot had Gertrude chosen for her summer home; on a gentle eminence, with the tall mountain tops seen glimmering in the distance, and the village nestled near, mirrored in the clear water. A beautiful retreat was Glenwood, or"The Villa," as it wasi more familiarly called. Each autumn Gertrude lingered longer, and would fain have remained altogether, but Mr. Selden could not be absent always from the city, so their winters were passed in New-York, where his name was not all unknown to fame   !.:.      BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        143 and where they had gathered around them a treasured circle : of warm friends. The sunset hour hath for many a strange influence. To some it bringeth solemn thoughts. We hail the daily rising of the earth-light God hath given, and'as we watch the going down thereof, how know we, that the next farewell beams may not glance upon our sealed eyes and death-stilled forms? It hath an influence, and those who stood together there owned its spell. The evening saw them gathered in a pleasant room that looked out on the scene, which had awakened feelings of rever- : ence and love. Gertrude opened the Holy Book, and read from its pages lessons of hope and trust. Each eye rested fondly on her, and Edward mingled his thanksgiving with her own, blessing the glorious Giver of all good. There was silence long. after she had ceased to speak, for memories of other hours seemed laid on every heart. Edward had been ill, but as a convalescent, his couch was removed to T "the room of the household," the pet nook of all. Harry sat l beside him ready to supply his every want, and a father might well be forgiven, if earthly hope should grow strong, mingling with earthly love, as he gazed upon this, the only bud God had A given them to rear for immortality.      \ Gentle, yet withal of manly bearing was Harry Selden. His very childhood gave promise of rare talent, and Ger- trude watched over him with trembling solicitude, striving to cherish the gifts bestowed, yet to fortify him for life's warring; to prepare him .for its stern discipline. As yet he had only known  its beauty, and looked out on the world hopefully, deeming it made up of many homes, each bright as was his own. Lucy Weston was very like to Gertrude, but there was ever more of joyousness within her heart, and her presence in her sister's home was welcome as the cheering sunlight. Many   "4        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. sought to win her thence, to form s" for Love another chain," but she turned away from all, and drew the closer unto those who formed HER world. Eulalie, with loveliness matured, was still a cherished guest, but would ere long return to her southern home, where she was fondly watched for. Lizzie's sudden death had been to her startling indeed. Touched by the loneliness of those left so destitute, she would fain have won the young and lovely Carrie, who brought so vividly to mind the lost companion of her girlhood. But she clung to her sister, refusing to hear aught of separation; so Eulie went to her far home with the youngest of that little band, the bright and joyous Lena. A warm and kindly welcome awaited the little stranger, and great was the rejoicing, when once more Eulalie entered her own dwelling. Each had for her little charge a fond and gentle greeting, sorrowing for the unconscious one, so bereft. "The fair fields of Bellevue seemed fairer still, and loveli- er," Ellerton said, " with Eulie to look on them," and as for his mother, he laughingly asserted she had been so dismal, there was no possibility of enlivening her. "But all will be right, now that Eulie is here," said the elder Mrs. Leslie, archly, " for I know a certain gentleman, who had some wild notion of setting out on a pilgrimage, enact- ing I Coelebs in search of a wife.'" The servants crowded around their young mistress, as they still called her, and "Linda the younger," representative of the Linda gone but not forgotten, whiled Lena from Eulalie, and bore her off in triumph, that her companions might have a look at the darling's bright face, and bless l"Miss Eulie" for bring- it among them. Eulalie liked not New Orleans, and when after her mother's death Gertrude persuaded Mr. Selden to remove, its associa tions and memories were all too sad.  But she loved the soft southern breeze that had fanned her brow in hours of ill-   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        145 ness and dreaded the keen winds of the northern clime; so, when the valuable lands of Bellevue, near Opelousas, were about to pass away to strangers, when those who had lived there long years needed but a little space therein to rest until the time when days and years should all be ended, she urged Ellerton to become the purchaser, to make it their home; and a very pleasant one it was. There were many to look up to them, many souls to care for, on the broad domain, yet none had cause for murmuring: but blessed with grateful hearts those who forgot not their inter- ests, their comforts, or their joy. It was there that Lena was henceforth to find her happiness; there was she to be fondly tended, watched, and sheltered-a rare and lovely bud, whose blossoming might be yet more glorious in " the garden of God," when He who placed her here might see fit to call her to him- self. i\f',   CHAPTER II Come to my home, beloved ones, by the late's green shore, Bring there youth's sunlight, and it shall be lone no more. "There's still a spell around my spirit cast, A shadow where the sunbeam sniled before; 'Tis grief, but all its bitterness is past; 'Tis sorrow, but its murmurings are o'er. Within my soul, which to the storm was bowed, Now, the white wing of Peace is folded deep, And I have, I trust, behind the cloud, The blessing promised to the eyes that weep." MRS. DODD. "ZZIE," said Mrs. Selden, entering     the room  allotted to the girls, where they were pursuing their morning studies, "I have heard sad intelligence, to me, at least. Edward received a letter, this morning, from   Mr. Duncan, your uncle Walter, who has just learned our great loss.    He writes to offer you a home; nay, implores you to come to him, and soothe and cheer his loneliness. I would fain speak of myself, my own wishes, but Edward forbids it.    We feel that in this you must decide for yourself. You know, you must know, how very dear you are to me; you must feel that with me you can ever claim a home; but you must think of it, Lizzie, do not decide hastily; remember that your decision will influence a lifetime. Walter is the only being with whom you can now claim kindred, and I, who have known him so long, and well, dare not seek to win   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        147 you from I im. You are young, very young; many at your age are children still, but you have thought and judgment beyond your years, and I believe you competent to decide for both. Here is the letter; you can read it, and think it over; to-mor- row will be time enough to inclose your answer," and her voice was tremulous as she spoke, for, as she had said, very dear to her, who had never known a daughter's love, were those lonely girls. Eagerly they scanned the written thoughts of him who was to them almost a stranger. They had never looked on him hkut once, and then in early childhood, for he had been seeking to regain, in a foreign land, the health so shattered in his own. It was but a short time after hisareturn, when he had been called to Geneva, where he expected to spend the remainder of his life, that the sad news of Lizzie's death reached him. An irrepressible yearning for something to love once more came over him, and he sought to brighten his home with those who now seemed lonely as himself. Very different were the thoughts awakened in the minds of the sisters by his touching appeal. Lizzie, who had ever been guided by those she loved, turned gladly to this new support. She welcomed the memory of one whom she had always revered. She mused upon his words, and dreamy visions passed before her, picturing them inmates of that peaceful home, its very name bringing thoughts of beau- ty, with one to love so competent to guide them. Her thoughts were shadowed in the pleading words mur- mured in her sister's ear," Let us go to Uncle Walter. Carrie." ( Go! what for, Lizzie? Why should we go to that old parsonage?  I am sure it is just as dull as it can be, with t nothing to enliven us, no company but stupid villagers, or per- haps a few pigs and chickens." "Oh, Carrie, you forget our uncle." ! No, I did not forget our uncle; but he will have enough to do to preach and pray, and attend to the " maimed, and halt,   "8        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. and blind," and there was a, deeper color in her cheek while her lips curled contemptuously. '"Carrie, do not speak so scornfully; I scarcely know you in such a mood. Uncle wrote so kindly, and your name was so oft repeated, proving that one of his nieces was very dear. I am sure you will learn to love him." "Learn to love! I do not wish to learn to love; it must come without calling. To hear you speak, one would think love had an alphabet!" "And so it has, my sister; and you and I have not long since conned its saddest letters, tears! I did not think my mother's child would so soon need to be reminded of " Oh! stop, Lizzie-do not say it-forgive me! Iiow could I forget!" and she wept bitterly over memories so sad. Carrie Duncan had been the household idol, accustomed to have every wish gratified, every caprice yielded to-a child of impulse in whom good and evil strangely blended. Sadly indulged, beautiful and wayward, she needed a restraining hand, and the guidance of one who, looking to the spirit's wel- fare, could resist the witchery of her rare and winning loveli. ness. Lizzie touched the right chord in recalling her mother's me- mory, for her gentle parent had ever been the object of her deepest love. She wept at first as though the tears would never cease to flow, but after a time left her sister to bathe her dim eyes and smooth the hair which was clustering so thickly round her face. But when she returned to seek her book, she whispered, "I will go with you, Lizzie!" Long after every trace of tears had vanished from the bright face, and her joyous laugh made answer to Harry's jesting words, Lizzie pondered over that morning's eventful hours. The responsibilities resting on her seemed almost fearful. Should she withdraw her sister from Gertrude's watchful care? Would she be thus guided and, beloved in her uncle's home?   'I           BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         149 were questions still unanswered when she laid her aching head on the pillow. She was then sixteen, Carrie but two years her junior, yet she seemed so much a child, one to be carefully trained and watched with patient love, for few would understand the high and fearlessuispirit, spurning control, yet subdued ever by kind- ness. :-   Sleep came at last, and dreams in which her mother's face was blending with and changing into Walter's, and her child- hood past, wildly intermingling with the future. She awoke feverish and unrefreshed, but the blessing which she implored from Heaven seemed givento strengthen the drooping spirit, and calm the troubled heart. When Mr. Selden asked for her answer, she felt that anx- ious eyes were bent upon her, but she knew that now there must be no hesitation, and though her voice trembled, it did not fail her as she replied- ' I have thought of all, and it seems to me best that we should go to our uncle." "Oh, Lizzie!" was Carrie's despairing ejaculation. She did not trust herself to say more, but, seeking the summer- house (where they were wont to pass the early morning), gave vent in solitude to grief. There, a half hour after, Harry found her, and tried to ad- minister the consolation he had come to seek. They formed, in that hour, many plans for the future, when no vision of an unwelcome uncle was to come between them and joy.  Carrie promised to write faithfully to her young champion in all her difficulties, and many sage resolutions were made to be acted on in future emergencies. They lingered to form wreaths of the white and purple larkspur to press amid the leaves of books which they were always to love for each other's sake. And when Harry, who had been twining the long silky curls of his playmate around his fingers, timidly asked for one   150        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. to treasure after she was gone, she would fain have -cut them all, had he suffered her; " though to be sure,", she said, " it would not be like having them playing bo-peep at him always on her mad-cap head." Walter was to join them in a week. but desired that they might be ready to aceompany him, as he would be obliged to return immediately. Carrie murmured a little, but only a very little after her uncle arrived. When he folded her in his arms and kissed her, when she heard his whispered 1"God bless her,:' she told Harry that she grew quite good-a fact which he had never doubted. "She saved all her tears for the good-by time," she said, and very freely they flowed when the last words were spoken, the parting glance given. There was one gleam of comfort even then, for Gertrude came to the carriage again to whisper that she would come to them ere long, and then, of course (Carrie decided) Harry would come too. There was no knowing whether the obliga- tion would be equally binding on the rest of the family. Pro. bably they were not thought of. Strange feelings stirred in Walter's heart as he journeyed on with his young charge; feelings, whose power he had deem- ed subdued. When ever and anon the joyous voice beside him would suddenly call his attention to something that pleased her, the veil of other years seemed put aside, revealing one, who had been the sunlight of his life, now wedded to the dust! But when he looked on Lizzie's sad and earnest face, he tried to cast aside the spell of the past, arrnd turn, for their sakes, to the changed present. He told them of the far-off countries he had visited; gave them many a history grave and gay. He pictured fair scenes, on which naught but a summer sun had ever shone; recorded deeds of daring he had witnessed; or led them far awayin thought to peasant homes, in the vintage time, when all was   ;            BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         151 ; gay and glad. He compared with others their own land, told i :* them of his quiet home, and of the bright lake which mirrored a" its beautiful shore, taking its name trom the Geneva far away. He spoke of his boyhood, of their father, of the home they shared so long, which -now existed but in memory--and his voice grew sad. Carrie drew nearer and placed her hand in j  his, as though she sorrowed ever to have felt aught but love for one so much bereft. It was too late in the evening on which they arrived at Geneva, for Carrie to gratify her curiosity as to the beauty or extent of the village. She was too tired and sleepy even to "iJ feel like laughing at the grotesque-looking figure that appeared ?j; to welcome them, and urged them to partake of the refreshment she had ventured to prepare. She was only too thankful to be  permitted to retire to the chamber, not so luxurious as that to which they had lately been accustomed, yet wearing an air of comfort and quiet vervy pleasant to the travellers. "Good night, my dears," said a strange shrill voice while a turbaned, head peering in and out of the door, seemed to Carrie's drowsy vision the realization and living embodiment of the figure in the puppet-show she had once chanced to glance at near her old home. The bright sunlight had long gladdened the earth, ere Carrie awoke from her deep slumber; Lizzie had been reading nearly an hour, but all seemed still, and she did not care to disturb her. Walter was alone when they joined him;   but when, after the morning  devotions, they were seated around the simple board, Carrie seemed to miss some one. Looking towards the door, then at her uncle, she ventured at length to ask for the person who met them the preceding night. Walter smiled and seemed strangely amused. "That was Miss Mary Dalrytlple; she resides near to the church over the way."  And he quietly attended to their wants, without satisfying farther poor Carrie's curiosity.   152        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. "I shall be obliged to leave you this morning," he said to Lizzie, when the meal was ended, marking her wondering glance at his preparations for departure. "Ours is a simple home, my children, but it will I trust prove a happy one to you;" and he kissed them fondly ere he went forth on his labor of love, for he had been absent many days, and there might be those who needed a pastor's care. Carrie followed, him to the door, and as he turned to leave her, a busy, bustling little body hurried towards them, ex- claiming, "Ah, good morning, Mr. Duncan! good morning, my dear! (bowing to Carrie.) I thought the poor things might feel lonely, so stepped over for company ;" and as Walter bowed and disappeared she continued, "Better not stand here in the sun, my love, it is dangerous, very; plenty of time yet to look about you; young folks should never be in a hurry; plenty of time!" Carrie followed the strange guest into the parlor, and while she accosted Lizzie in a similar manner, took a survey of this " prodigy of Geneva," as she mentally styled her. Miss Mary Dalrymple, or "Miss Molly," as the children called her (much to her indignation), was a lady of no par- ticular age. Indeed, it was a matter to which she attached so little importance, that she never cared to remember it. She had seen better days, but when fortune proved unkind, re- signed herself submissively to its caprices, clinging affection- ately to memories of the past, as to relics of departed greatness. She could not be called beautiful; she might have been, but the small-pox leaves sad traces where beauty dwelt before, and she had been one of its victims. The lady once rejoiced in a wealth of sunny tresses (so she said), but was shorn of them during a spell of illness, and had never since been able to coax back more than two or three short ringlets, which peeped forth suspiciously from the antique turban that always graced her brow. She had formerly delighted much in the adorn-   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.

She had from the first hour of their meet- ing appropriated him to herself, feeling convinced that she (Miss Mary Dalrymlple) was the only living woman capable of appreciating him: or his merits, fully satisfied that sooner or later he would conme to the same conclusion. And now that those dear children were with him, he would more than ever feel the need of some one to aid him in their care and guid-   ance. So with her most winning manner, in her most be- coining attire, she prepared to be perfectly irresistible; to win his heart through theirs, " poor dears." Walter was grieved at first, and felt tempted to repulse her, but when he understood her better, resolved, calmly and patiently, to wait until she should grow weary of this strange pertinacity. But Miss Mary had not heard from   his lips so often the words, "Let us not be weary in well-doing," only to forget them.  She applied them daily to her own case, and regarded her actions with a self-complacency too often shared by others. "Poor Miss Dalrymple," was ever Walter's pitying mental ejaculation, after one of her visitations; and he might have been pardoned if his parting words were a shade more cordial than tho se of welcome.  But in blissful ignorance of her pas- tor's musings, Miss Mary kept on -unfalteringly in the path she had marked out for herself, looking hopefully to some in- definite period, when her labors should be rewarded, the con- test over, the victory won I   CHAPTER III "I remember, I remember, how hush'd and mute we were, When he led our spirits up to God in heartfelt, melting prayer!

THE village bells rang out sweet and clear on the summer air, calling from many a simple dwelling the old and young, the feeble and the strong, to the church where, for long years, hoary heads had gone up to worship God! It was there that Lizzie and Carrie Duncan went with Walter, in the calm Sab- bath morning, and many an eye turned pityingly on the young strangers. Many a mother drew nearer to her own darlings and sighed for those now motherless; and admiring glances rested on the beautiful face of Carrie Duncan, as she threw back the deep folds of heavy crape, that the soft breeze might fan her burning cheek. It was the first time they had been seen in the village, yet their history was well known. It had been rumored that Walter had gone to bring back a bride, and expectation was at   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         155 its height, and idle curiosity somewhat rebuked, when he re- turned with his brother's orphans. None, save Miss Dalrymple and Mrs. Lawrence, had yet extended to them a welcome, and the impulsive Carrie seemed as eager to bestow upon the latter her warm affection, as on the former her abundant dislike. Earthly feelings seemed however calmed, and when the song of praise was hushed, Walter's voice was raised in sup- plication; and the peace whi'h he implored came even then to nmany hearts, for eyes that had been wandering now turned to hin, and listless ears were opened to his words. With reverent air he sought the, Book Divine, and, though the words of his text had oft been heard before, they seemed now to reach the heart: "For the fashion of this world pass- eth away!" He spoke of the emptiness of earthly joys-their nothingness compared with those of Heaven-of the insuffi- ciency of wealth and honors alone to make us blest. Fame was but for a season; "as a breath created, so might a breath de- stroy!" fortune's favors deceitful, which came and fled ere we could rejoice o'er new-found treasures. He spoke of earth's purest joys, its holiest gifts, the love of friends, the communion of kindred spirits! But these, alas! were all too fleeting. : Though love should ne'er forsake and friendship prove most true, it could not be for aye. -He spoke of the severing of earthly ties-the breaking of life's brightest links--of homes made desolate, and hearts left lone; and eyes grew dim with tears, and sighs echoed back his words, for "There is no fireside, howe'er defended, But hath one vacant chair; There is no fold, however tended, But one dead lamb is there!" But when from memories so sad he led their thoughts to Him who chasteneth every son whom He receiveth; who, though "the Holy One and Just,"?' hath also taught that' "God is love!"   156        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. when he told of the glories of that better home where change ne'er had a name-whence sorrow and sighing flee away; when he urged them to seek the life which is everlasting--to heed the glorious message spoken through him, offering to all who would receive, joy, joy evermore, there was a silence as of death, and, in many a young-touched heart the fervent prayer awoke-"Be thou, oh God, the guide of my youth!" "Lizzie," whispered- Carrie, as they stood together in the church-yard, " do you not wish that Harry could listen to Un. cle Walter?" and Lizzie could not repress a smile as she an- swered- "Perhaps he may, very soon." A sweet voice beside them called their thoughts to other themes. The speaker was a fair, delicate child, whose pure young gaze wakened an interest in all who looked on it! "Mamma bade me ask," said the little girl, " if you would not like to join us this afternoon? We meet here in the church, just before sunset, to read and hear the Scriptures. If you will, I am to call for you; do come!" and her glance turned entreatingly towards Carrie. "We shall be very happy to go with you, if our uncle ap- proves," Lizzie replied. "4 Oh, Mr. Duncan will not object; he is often with us; so I shall call at the parsonage for you. Mamma will be so hap- py!" and Rose Lawrence (for it was the widow's child), with a light step bounded away to rejoin her mother. Mrs. Lawrence was much beloved in the village. She had not dwelt there long-yet long enough to befriend the needy, seek out the desolate, and soothe the sorrowing. She was grieved to find that there was no institution for the spiritual instruction and guidance of the young, and that, save the reli- gious families, their souls were little cared for. Gradually, but not without much opposition, she had form- ed the class Rose spoke of, persuading the children to meet her on each Sabbath, and as parents became more interested,   -BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        157 the number of pupils increased; and when Walter came among them, rejoicing to find that much good had been already done he proposed removing to the church, so that the elders might have the opportunity of listening to or aiding in their instruc- tion should they be so inclined. Walter's presence encouraged and gratified the children, for he was a favorite with them all. There were few as yet of his parishioners who understood or justly appreciated the minister. The good looked up to him with reverence, which could not yet approach him; the wicked feared his disapproving glance, yet more than his mild rebuke, and many a romantic history of his past life was woven by the curious, wherewith to furnish food'for gossips. But the little children, whom he ever met with smiles and loving words, on whose heads his hand was often laid in bless- ing, remembered his gentle teachings and earnest counsels; I  and to please the minister, that he might love them, was a new incentive, a spring in their existence, a page in life's re- v  cords to be kvpt pure and bright in memory. Lizzie Dunican had scarcely welcomed Rose Lawrence that I: evening, ere the familiar voice of Miss Dalrymple was heard, not a very welcome sound to poor Carrie, whose startled move- I  ment scattered on the floor the bright flowers Rose had brought - her' and as she stooped to collect them, Miss Mary undertook   to convince her of the impropriety of such employment. "I hope, my dear, you have not been making nosegays on the Sabbath; you must learn the commandments: "Keep holy the Sabbath day," "Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth." You had better put them   away, my love. I, What would your uncle say, if he were to see them? I hope you will never do it again.- "Six days shalt thou " "I brought them to her, Miss Mary, she did not gather them," faltered poor Rose, unwilling that any one should be blamed for her misdeeds. "I brought them, mamma did not, object!" "Now, Rose Lawrence, you naughty child, I am    very 7*   158        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. sure your Ma would not approve such sinful doings. I shall take care to inform her what a bad example you have been setting the minister's nieces;" and her indignant frown brought tears to the eyes of poor Rose, and caused Carrie to desist in the act of placing the offending roses in a vase. Lizzie trem- bled as she marked the scornful expression of her sister's face, and would fain have won her to silence, but it was too late. "Pray. Miss Mary," she said, " is there a commandment which forbids the flowers to bloom upon the Sabbath? or the sun to shine? or the winds to blow? for, if there is, I shall set about learning it immediately! What a pity it is that your sex forbids the thought; you would make a capital preacher, and prove such a valuable assistant to my uncle." "Very well, Miss Caroline Duncan, very well; if it pleases you, ridicule my counsel; I did not mean to offend; it was rightly meant;" and the youthful spinster shook herself anid her Sunday turban very violently out of the room, leaving poor Rose in silent consternation. "Carrie," whispered Lizzie, " be calm, I know you will be sorry for this to-morrow. Come with me, my own sister, let us go to church and meet my uncle," for Carrie had thrown aside her bonnet and scarf seemingly immovable. "I cannot, Lizzie," she replied, aloud; f' I cannot see that horrible woman again to-day, I believe she will be the death of me." "Oh, do come, Miss Carrie," said Rose, laying her hand timidly on Carrie's; " do come! 'Mamma will be so sorry, and I shall think you are offended with me, because of the flowers." Carrie yielded to her gentle persuasions, and went with them, in no very enviable frame of mind, to hear the reading of " the Word," whose teachings she had mocked, and when as she listened to the gentle Mrs. Lawrence she reflected on her conduct she could have wept for shame, but Miss Mary's head appearing among them then, her heart was steeled again, and she resolved to give no token of penitence. Poor Carrie! her   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        159 good resolutions of the morning were scattered like the bright flowers that lay crushed, and withering at home, for childhood; e'en as riper age, requireth ever the teachings and guidance of the Holy Spirit to choke the growth of the evil sin hath planted in the human heart. Carrie had no pleasure that afternoon in those solemn and instructive exercises; and when others went away with quiet, peaceful thoughts, she returned to her home disquieted. Walter marked her strange demeanor, and would have drawn her to his side, asking in kindly tones if she were not ill or unhappy; but she shrank from him, and went to her own room, and kneeling beside the bed, buried her face in the snowy drapery and wept. There Walter found, and sought to soothe her, after learn- ing from Lizzie the events of the evening, and finding that she returned no answer to his earnest words, he said, "Let us pray together, dearest, that our Heavenly Father will purify our hearts, and aid us by His Holy Spirit, to resist tempta- tion, and strengthen us to overcome evil." He knelt beside her, and in words that shadowed forth the feelings and thoughts of her troubled heart, besought the throne of grace for the child so dear to him, and ere he ceased, the dove of peace seemed hovering o'er the troubled waters, calming them 'neath its holy influence, and Carrie Duncan threw her arms about her uncle's neck, and whispered as he pressed her to his bosom- "Help me always, dear uncle, to watch and pray." "God will help you, my child; if you but seek refuge be- neath the shadow of His love, there you will ever find a shel. ter. He loves you more than I can love, and is ever willing to pity and to forgive." He left her alone with thoughts that turned to Heaven and the angels; to the loved one who had gone to dwell among them.- As she sat there, resting her head against the low couch, the evening air came through the open window, cooling   160        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. her flushed cheeks, and an hour after Lizzie found her sleep. ing there, with the- bright tears still glistening on the long lashes, but a sweet smile on the parted lips. And as Lizzie bent to kiss the fair brow, she thought that God had neaer created aught more lovely. *    !  ! CHAPTER IV. "Around their hearth by night, What gladsome looks of household love Met in the ruddy light. There young glad voices flowed in song, Or childhood's tale was told, Or lips moved tunefully along ,Some glorious page of old." SUMMER with its flowers had passed away. The autumn leaves were falling where they had bloomed, and Carrie sighed to think how dull must be the winter, with the blue lake frozen over, and nothing bright without to look upon. A   dreamy vision of Miss Dalrymple in clogs made her think of school, and wish to be sent away.  "Our education," she would mentally argue, " must be attended to, and as to obtaining masters here, it is not to be thought of." But she did not long comfort herself thus, nor was consola- tion needed when Walter's plans were known.     She found no time to murmur had she felt inclined. It was their uncle's'intention  to direct their studies him- self. He did not desire to have them educated merely for the world, or accomplished to please the fastidious. Mrs. Lawrence, whose musical talent had been highly cul, tivated, proposed that they should share the instruction given to her daughter, an opportunity they did not allow to pass   162        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. unimproved, for Carrie was a lover of music and gifted with a voice of singular sweetness. The morning was generally devoted to study; " their own hours," as Carrie named the evening, were seasons of tare en. joyment. Rose Lawrence was often with them, and then the glad voices would blend in old familiar songs, or anon be hushed to list the lore of other times. When the good-night drew near, they would gather closer round the fire for a part- ing chat, and Walter, gazing on the bright faces clustered there, oft wondered if other homes could be so happy. Those were joyous hours! Their memory is precious still, though numbered with the things of long ago; and many winters, come and gone since then, have left sadder tokens in each heart. Carrie stood one morning looking out musingly on the fantastic wreaths left by the snow of yesterday on hanging boughs, and wondering how long they would linger ere the sunbeams kissed them away, when a light step heard upon the stair made her throw aside her book to meet the welcome in- truder. "I had a presentiment that it was you, Rosy," she said, helping her to lay aside the shawls with which a mother's care had shielded her from the cold. "Now are you quite sure Miss Mary is not behind me?" and she laughed at the terrified glance directed toward the door, "No, she is not there. I begged mamma to let me come, just to read you the very best letter you ever heard, from the handsomest, dearest brother any body ever had. Now do not laugh, or you shall not even peep," unfolding at the samE time the well-filled sheet and placing it in Lizzie's hands. "Read it aloud, Miss Lizzie," she said, " for I shall never tire of hear- ing the glad news." "Has it been very long, Rose, since you saw this wonder-   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         163 ful brother?" asked Carrie, when the letter was returned to its happy owner. i' Almost a year. It seems a long time, does it not, to be away from one you love so very dearly?" ' It does; indeed; it is very nearly that since we parted with Lena," and Lizzie sighed, for still she missed the happy pet. I!   " "Ay," said Carrie, " it may be many more before we see her again! But tell us now, Rose, whom does this brother resemn- ble? and what is his name? Is he very tiny, like you, or tall,   as uncle Walter? And will he be very proud and dignified, looking down on us with disdain, as does Miss Mary, or care for naughty me as much as sister Lizzie," and she tossed back her curls and smiled so consciously, for well she knew i: that Miss Mary was the only one who had ever dared to resist her. I   "His name?" answered the laughing Rose, " is Sydney, -and they say,' she added softly," he is like our father. I do not know whether you will think him dignified, but he is not e  at all proud, and never treats any one with contempt. As to you. he may perhaps love you for my sake, but I am sure he will like Miss Lizzie for her own." "Now shame on you, Rose! I am half resolved to name him "Ogre," or "Blue Beard," or something equally terrible, and not like him in the least, even if he is your brother!" Long and merrily the maidens chatted, forming plans for the future, in which "Brother Sydney " figured conspicuously, and Carrie communicated the intelligence they had received from Mrs. Selden, told how she should count the weeks and  months until spring, when Harry and his father would visit themn, for Harry was going to College, the only thought that made her sad. He would be so lonely, and miss them  all so much, for he was not like any one else. Rose would think so, if she only knew him." And Rose listened eagerly: and thought of all she had ever read of spirits, and visions, and wingless i   164        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. angels, for surely he must be something more than earthly, who could prove in any way superior to her brother. But when after long watching (that did not in the least augment his speed) he really came, how triumphantly Rose escorted him to the parsonage to see Mr. Duncan, she said; and when he received the minister's cordial welcome and was presented to his nieces, what a look of amazement was on his face, as he bowed to the tall young lady before him, looking so much older than she really was. Turning from her he met Carrie's mirthful glance, and indulged in a merry laugh which won her quite, and made them allies from thenceforth, for as she assured Rose, he looked so commanding at first, he awed her into nothingness. And when his mother joined them, and consented to remain for the evening,-a more joyous group had seldom been gathered there. Walter conversed with the young student on topics of general interest, and the happy mother drew nearer to Lizzie, glad to find more than one pleased listener, while Rose and Carrie sat apart exchanging telegra- phic communications, intelligible only to themselves. When in the still evening music was asked for, and Lizzie prepared to accompany her sister in some simple ballads, the rich full tones of the stranger blended with their own, and the melody went home to every heart.  Sydney Lawrence seemed no longer a stranger, and he thought, as he laid his head on his pillow at night, that the village was vastly improved since he left it. He had been attending the medical lectures in New-York, and came but for one short week, for the course was not com- pleted; but he cheered the young trio with the hope of his return. He would come back with the first flowers, he said, and they would cherish him as a rare exotic. He would be all the more valuable, too, for he would come bearing not his shield, but his " sheepskin," and he threatened to be very for- midable, advising them duly to rehearse his title that was to be. That week seemed shorter than all that had preceded it;   vUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        165 and certainly more so than those which followed it; but for her part, Miss Mary said, it was a good thing she thought that trifling young Lawrence was gone, for no good ever came of so much idling; it was a lamentable thing, and she wondered how poor dear Mr. Duncan could endure their merriment, though, to be sure, he had looked very grave of late (it was perceptible only to herself), and must be sadly at a loss to manage those madcap girls; she would put on her things, and run over a while to look after them, which resolve was immediately put into execution. Her sudden approach caused Carrie to meditate a flight, but Lizzie's imploring look stayed her. "Well, my dear, how are you this wintry weather?" and offering Lizzie her hand, she bowed to Carrie, and seated herself near the fire, proceeding uninvited to divest herself of her numerous wraps. "It has been quite an age since I saw you out, so I ventured over to look after you." "We have been much engaged of late," said Carrie, who had resolved to be silent, but Lizzie seemed speechless, so she felt obliged to make some reply. , Yes!, Miss Caroline (Miss Mary had always been careful to give her the appellation, since the memorable Sabbath evening), I hear you have been very particularly engaged. When I was young, that is, very young, I was careful how I laughed and talked with young gentlemen; it was considered very improper, though to be sure I did not set up for a beauty," and she drew her head up, and the corners of her mouth down, and Carrie thought it would have been strange if she had, but she checked her thoughts, and continued her work in silence. "Pray, Miss Caroline, if it is not too bold, may I ask who is to be the fortunate possessor of that purse you are netting so diligently? I suppose I must never again accuse you of being idle?" "I cannot tell how long my industrious mood may last, but I have no objection to your knowing that the purse is for an old friend and playmate, Harry Selden, whose name I fear will not greatly enlighten you."   166        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. Foiled in her attempt to provoke Carrie, she turned to Lizzie, talked of the weather, the village and its inhabitants, looked at the clock, wondering what could detain Mr. Duncan, perfectly unconscious that he had been in the house for the last half hour. He came in at last, however, and she called up one of her most gracious smiles, and informed him that she had been enjoying a nice little chat with the dear girls; recommended for his cough some infallible syrup (home-made: of course), which he politely declined, assuring her that he did not consider it necessary. She supposed she should see him. at Widow Brown's on the morrow; congratulated him on the good he had effected; then remembering that the widow's grandson, John Smith, had called to see her that morning, when she felt it,her duty to remonstrate with him on his present evil course, and had gained a promise from him to read the Bible, she must ask the favor of Mr. Duncan to fur- nish him with a copy. She had but one in her possession, and that, though old fashioned, and well used, she prized too highly ever to make use of another, for it had been handed down from her great-great-grandfather." Her visit, like all other wearying things. came at length to an end. and poor Carrie put away her work with a sigh, and declared her intention of keeping it on hand to be brought out hereafter, when Miss Mary Dalrymple should favor them with her presence. "I have come for you, dear girls, to accompany us to the Glen," said Mrs. Lawrence, entering the parsonage one after- noon with Rose. "The ground is dry, and the sunshine is quite cheering; I think a long walk will be beneficial. I am going to a sad home, however, for its youngest and its best is about to be taken. You doubtless remember Fanny Bailey, the pale, delicate child, who generally sits near Rose V" C"Yes, I have noticed how well she answers Uncle Walter; but is she so very ill, dear Mrs. Lawrence " said Carrie.   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         167 "They telr me that she is dying; and I thought that one whose life had been so pure and guileless, would be at peace in her latest hours!" Rose had been sad and silent, as they pursued their walk, but when they entered the humble dwelling; and she saw the fearful ravages-disease had made in the poor sufferer, she wept aloud. When she grew cal'n, her mother led her to the bed- side; and Fanny's face lighted yith a smile, as she stretched out her hand to welconme her, and motioning her to draw nearer, she whispered, "Do not weep for me, Miss Rose, I am going to the bright land your mother told us of; I am going to be with the Good Shepherd, who careth for His sheep, and I do not feel afraid!" They did not linger, for Mrs. Lawrence feared to excite her too much; but as they left her, she pointed to heaven and smiled so brightly, it did not seem like dying," Carrie said; " and oh how she hoped when it came her time to go, to be as willing to shut her eyes on the beautiful earth and the many who loved her." The impression made upon her heart lingered long after the spirit of the child was at rest, and her name had ceased to be spoken among her playfellows; and often in evil moments, when the tempter seemed to be gaining power, the vision of a pale young face, with the glad smile brightening it into beauty, would come up before her, to calln the angry thoughts and passions of her ]eart, Fanny was reared among the children of poverty, early inured to hardship, taught to labor for her daily bread.

"The cloud may be dark, but there's sunshine beyond it,. The night may be o'er us, but morning is near; The vale may be deep, but there's music around it, And hope mid our sorrow, bright hope is still here!" WHLE Fanny Bailey was laid upon a bed of death in her humble home, far away, in the sunny South, a sorrowing group watched in a luxurious chamber by the sick couch of little Lena Duncan, or Leslie, as she was now called. Many weary days had passed since she was laid there with the fever touch upon her. The crisis had come, and the hour which would take her from or leave her still with those whose happi- ness seemed bound up in her. Eulahe had refused to leave her side, and for two long sleepless nights had kept her vigil: As she sat there with Leslie's supporting arm thrown round herc her anxious thoughts found utterance in praye: :- Father in Heaven! look kindly down Upon our smitten dove; Call not away the treasure giv'n So lately to our love!

Teach us to guide her steps aright, To lead them up to thee- A star within the Saviour's crown For evermore to be! But if thy love from ill unknown, By our dim eyes unseen, Would shield her safely, where no sin Or grief hath ever been, Forgive our heart's wild yearning, Teach us to do thy will, To bow unmurm'ring to thy word, To suffer, and be still I "God will not leave us lonely, my own," whispered Eller- ton, drawing her yet nearer, as he looked upon the words her trembling hand had traced. And it seemed indeed as though the heart's deep aspiration had winged its way to heaven, bearing back to earth. from the throne of the Eternal, a message of joy, sending life and light to the children of men.  Even as Ellerton spoke, the lips qui- vered; Lena moved restlessly, and   looked upon  the anxious watchers with the conscious gaze they feared would never glad- den them more. "Eulie," she  murmured; and Eulalie bent over her, took the fevered hands in hers. and kissed them again and again. "Do not excite her, Mrs. Leslie, I pray you," said the phy- sician, who had remained throughout the day. "Danger seems past, but unless she is kept perfectly quiet, I cannot answer for the consequences."   170        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. Eulie yielded at last to their persuasions, and sought re. pose. leaving their mother and Linda to watch beside the trea.- sure. won almost from the grave. Slowly Lena recovered strength, and for some time it was feared that she would never entirely regain her wonted health and vigor. Eulalie devoted herself to her suffering charge. No exer. tion, no sacrifice, seemed too great to be made for Lena. Time and talents were wholly absorbed iti this one care, and vainly Ellerton urged her to share it with others. Lena soon became exacting, and seemed contented only when Eulahe was near her. She was passionately fond of mu- sic; and for her amusement, Eulie would weave in many a graceful rhyme, thoughts she loved, and sing them softly- to some sweet melody. It seemed soothing to the little girl, and she never wearied of repeating them. "I wonder, Mrs. Leslie, you are not afraid of ruining that child," said a frank visitor, marvelling at Eulalie's ready com- pliance with some wish of Lena's she deemed unreasonable. "I do not wish to spoil her," Eulalie replied ; a' but she suf- fers so much, that I cannot refuse aught that may gratify her, or brighten the hours which pain must make so wearying. When she recovers, she will be less dependent on us for hap- piness, more willing to be guided." "It may be as you say,- but I should really fear to be so indulgent. It might eventuate in unhappiness to her. Were she thrown among those who cannot feel for her the same in- terest, she would expect the same yielding regard to every de. sire. The stern realities of life would find her unprepared, unfitted to meet them, and then her heart, if not her lips, may repay you with reproaches. You must forgive me that I dare say to you, what others say of you. I mean it well, for none are more sincerely interested in your welfare than myself" Eulalie thought Mrs. Glanville somewhat harsh; yet when she reflected on her words, she saw her own error, apd resolved   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. was pleading) to listen to the dictates of prudence, but she continued firm, and ere long perceived the beneficial results attending such a course. When the summer came again, Lena seemed to have won back the rose to her cheek, and her eye had more of its wonted lustre. The physician advised exercise in the open air; and Ellerton procured for her a snow-white palfrey, at the sight of which she seemed almost wild with joy. For days her imagin- ation was sorely taxed for a name worthy this (" beauty, all her own too." The'fanciful title of Starlight " was at last fixed upon, for she said there must be stars hidden far back in the eyes that were at once her wonder and admiration. Often in the early morning, she and Starlight flitted blithe- ly over the fields of Bellevue, while the old negroes looked on in ecstasy, declaring, " they neber before see noting so lubly." Their humble praise was often echoed in courther guise. As time passed on, sometimes in the still evening, the fairy figure on her treasured steed would fleeting pass through the neighboring town, while Ellerton and Eulalie, in the distance, were vainly urging her to linger; but when startled to find herself so far alone, she would hastily return, greeting them with a  happy laugh, while the brightness of her eyes rivalled those of Starlight. Strangers oft turned to look again on the face so lovely in its happiness, asking the name of those to whom belonged so bright a  gem. The history of her orphaned childhood, kindly told, touched many a  heart, and the group ,became objects of still deeper interest to those who went away with a  gentle "God bless her," and an added memory of this northern bud, blossoming so brightly beneath a southern sun. Lena sported on, unconscious that she had wakened kindly feelings in any other home save that which sheltered her. "Papa," (for so she called Ellerton) loved her, and Eulie, (to   172    -     BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. whom she would give no other appellation,) darling Eulie did she knew. Grandmama Leshe was the kindest and best: and what cared she for any others to share her affection? Oh, yes, she must not forget Sister Lizzie, and Carrie. Then she would begin to wonder when she should see them, or if they would think her grown as tall as papa said. She would take out the last letter from the far away sisters to learn it by heart again, and build many an airy castle, with Starlight for a foundation, thinking that they would become realities at some future day. Very happy and lovely was Lena, and so thought an artist who, passing-through Opelousas, had been solicited by Eulalie to picture for them the features they so loved to gaze upon, Sketches were made of the little fairy in varied attitudes. The bright face, skilfully portrayed; was sent with a braid of fair hair away to Sister Lizzie, to be treasured long after woman's loveliness had banished childhood's careless grace, and the spell of thought been laid on the smooth brow, quieting the smiling lip. What strange feelings are awakened when after long years we turn to treasured memories, seeking their sacred memo- rials! When we look upon some glossy curl severed long ago, from a head now white with years and care, or buried out of sight! When we read a name traced by tiny fingers, which may since then have wielded the battle-sword. or pointed sin- ners to the Cross! As we gaze with yearning love upon a face familiar to our youth, but now so strangely altered; as we look into eyes once full of joy, now dimmed and lustreless, and seek vainly for the rose-tint on the cheek, the soft curls shading its beauty! But oh! deeper, sadder far, the thoughts that waken tears, when we gaze on pictured beauty, remem- bering that the loved and lovely have passed for aye; that the eyes we loved to look upon are sealed to us, and the voice that gladly to our own made answer, is silent now; and the light step, which was wont to meet us, echoes in our home and   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.       !73 about ourpath no longer! Then we clasp ,the mute memen toes to our lonely hearts, and with yet another lingering gaze place them among holy things, where no stranger's eye may look upon them until we have joined the band so severed When they shall lay us, dust to dust, beside the beings wh( made earth and life so dear, but whose flitting left us dark and lonely! J                '   CHAPTER VI. al There is a gem which hath the power to show If plighted lovers keep their vows, or no; If faithful, it is like the leaves of spring; If faithless, like those leaves when withering, Take back again your emerald gem, There is no color in the stone; It might have graced a diadem, But now its hue and light are gone!" IT was well perhaps for Carrie Duncan that Miss Mary Dal- rymple had gone on an errand of love, or pity, to the Widow Brown's cottage, when Harry Selden arrived at the parson- age, for that proper person might have received a shock indeed had she witnessed the meeting. Carrie made no attempts at young-ladyism, which, considering her fifteenth birthday had been celebrated that week, was very strange. She could not watch from the window quietly the coming of one so dear, or welcome him with courteous, gentle words, as did her sister- no, not such was Carrie's greeting. With sparkling eyes and crimsoned cheek, she bounded away to meet them, and was quickly folded in Mr. Selden's embrace; then turning joyously to Harry, placed both hands in his, and led them into the house, questioning him  eagerly, giving him  scarce time to answer her hurried inquiries. "Why, Carrie," said Mr. Selden, (as they assembled that   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         175 evening to talk over all that had passed since they parted,) you have grown surprisingly-as tall as Lizzie, I declare- quite a young lady! And here is Harry just off to college; why? some one will run off with his prize, while he is seeking honors, if I am not mistaken!" and he looked archly from one to the other as he spoke. But Harry had just remembered that he had forgotten to give Carrie the engravings, selected for her with so much care, and went in search of them, while she was so deeply interested in something that was passing without, that the observation seemed almost unheard. But those few words spoken in jest wakened thoughts in young hearts, which might otherwise have slumbered for years, or laid dormant for ever. And thus it hath often proved, that a tone or smile, a word as light as air, influences earthly destinies strangely, and oftentimes sadly too. Ere Harry Selden left Geneva he had sought to look into the clear depths of a girlish heart; he had turned to the bril- liant future he had won from the joyous and light-hearted, a sacred promise, yet lightly given, for its solemnity could scarce be felt by one like Carrie Duncan. Yet Harry's words were spoken earnestly and truthfully, and he turned to the new path before him with added interest, and proud resolve to de- serve the treasure he yet hoped to win. When these plans and joyful dreams were confided to his father, for from him he had no concealment, Mr. Selden turned away to hide the smile upon his lips, and advised him to think about his books, and not to send his heart flitting on such ro- mantic expeditions. Poor Harry felt abashed, and shrank within himself, feeling so much less a man, and wondering what Carrie would have thought had she heard that counsel. Carrie would have thought very little on the subject, and cared far less, for advice was lately so strangely blended with a vision of Miss Dalrymple, that she did not give much heed to any of it. But when Mr. Selden remarked the effect of his words he half regretted so sternly to have checked the passing fancy,   176        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. which, thought he, will pass away full soon, but which opposi. tion might foster, leading to serious results. Thus he reasoned, upon reflection, and when the time was come to go, marking Carrie's flushed cheeks and Harry's whispered words, he joined them, and taking the maiden's hand, smingled his farewell tones with those of her boy lover. Kindly smoothing back the curls from the bowed face, he kissed the fair brow, and reminded Harry that they must not linger, saying as they left her, "I suppose I must take care of this wild flower while you are gone, Master Harry," for which he was repaid by a glance of grateful affection from the youth, and the very sauciest of *0 smiles from the wilful maiden. They were gone, quite gone; and Carrie shut up her books and folding her hands, gazed from the window listlessly for one long hour, regardless of Lizzie's reiterated inquiries or ex- postulations; then she seemed to have just remembered some very important business, and hurried away, leaving Lizzie half- tempted to follow, wondering what had come over her sister, when the bright face looked in at the door as suddenly as it had disappeared. "I forgot to tell you, Lizzie, I am going to call for Rose. I promised to go with her this afternoon, to look for those lilies she spoke of; we are going to transplant some of them, and it is quite time, so you need not be uneasy about me," and away she went again, and her voice was echoed back like tones from a harp the wind had swept lightly over, as she sang sweet snatches of some olden song. "To whom can my little- Carrie be writing so many of her  bright thoughts?" questioned Walter, one morning, when he found her too much absorbed to hear his footstep, and he bent playfully over the writer. Carrie looked up in surprise and confusion, and hastily concealing the sheet among her papers, murmured some unin- telligible answer, and was about to leave the room, but her uncle detained her. He had asked the question playfully, not   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         1" dreaming it would have caused embarrassment, but now he thought that there must surely be a cause for her unwonted manner. "You have not told me the name of your new. correspond- ent," he continued gently, as Carrie stood near him, her little foot beating strange time to the ticking of the old clock. She hesitated then, as though other thoughts gained power, raised her head, and answered almost proudly, "I do not see why I should be ashamed that you should know; I have been writing to Harry; it is not the first time I have done so; we have ever been as brother and sister, and it would be stra. ige did we for- get to be so still." The words were spoken unfalteringly, but there was that in the tone that made Walter sad; there was that in the meaning they were intended to convey which made him fear that the child over whom he so fondly watched, was striving to mislead him, but he checked the thought that implied want of truthful- ness in her? and subduing his feelings, replied:  Well: suppose you let me read this long epistle of brother Harry's; perhaps I may have something to add to it myself," mand he smiled as he held out his hand, but was startled by the emotion of the young girl as trenmblingly she put it aside, and taking up the unfortunate letter, in an instant scattered it in   fragments on the floor. "Carrie, how you grieve me; I trusted that you had long since subdued that hasty spirit, which, if indulged, will, I fear, bring  sadness and sorrow to your heart and to  mine. Watch over it, my child. guard against it, pray for strength to resist it evermore," and he would have drawn her fondly to his side, but she resisted the gentle caress, and he turned sadly away leaving her alone, but sought her again ere long, hoping to find that the cloud had passed, and the sunshine of her heart would again be given to his own; but he went to find her re- suming the employment he had before so strangely interrupted. He stood beside her, and as his sigh reached her, she half   178        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. repented her late anger, and looked up imploringly to meet his glance, but there was sternness that she had never before seen in those eyes, and his voice was firm as he said, laying his hand on hers. "Carrie, I did not think to find you thus; it is, as you say, not the first time you have written to Harry Selden; now for- get not that I desire it shall be the last." There was no hope of change; the word had been said, and Walter was the only being Carrie never dared wilfully to dis- obey. His desire was to her even a law, and well she knew there had been cause for this. When she went to Lizzie in tears, she murmured, "It is unkind, unjust;" but her- heart smote her even then, and she listened to her sister more gently than was her wont. Long hours after, soothed and calmed, she placed her hand in Walter's, and told him she would do his bidding; and hope dawned in his heart, and half banished his fears lest the future of this, the cherished and beloved of many, should be darkened by the impulse so often prompting to evil. Summer came with its singing birds, its wealth of flowers, and among the first roses that bloomed in their fairy garden, came Dr. Sydney Lawrence, to win joyous welcomes from those in his own dear home and the happy group at the parsonage. Never so bright seemed a summer before, for Sydney won for them all so many holidays, and helped them to play truant so delightfully. When Mrs. Lawrence and Walter ventured to oppose such idle doings, they took sketch-books out for their companions, and Sydney attempted to guide their pencils in tracing the beautiful scener) amid which they loved to linger, to be carried back as trophies of industry. But it generally ended as it began, by the master's doing the work while the laughing pu- pils played the critics. They planned a rural feast, which kept the idle hands busy for some days, and Mrs. Lawrence consented to lend her pre-   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        179 sence and her aid, and Walter looked strangely unconscious while the preparations continued. Now Miss Mary Dalrym- pie had noticed wonderingly the flitting to and fro, and resolv- ed to discover and take part in whatever might be going on. I?   Accordingly she surprised the girls one morning by her sudden appearance,-even more unwelcome than usual, and Carrie, in despair, whispered to Sydney, "that their pleasure was all spoiled'now;" but his arch smile reassured her, and she con- tinued her employment in silence. Not very long, however, for in a few moments Sydney removed his chair and commenc- ed chatting very familiarly with Miss Dalrymple. At first, that lady seemed inclined to resent it; but as he talked on,/un- heeding her grave looks, she began to think that perhaps she had done young Lawrence injustice. Really he did not seem to be so bad after all ; and when, after a long conversation, he assured her, with a serious air and very grave face, that she was certainly intended for a minister's wife, the smile th t wreathed her thin lips was mysterious to behold. She looked condescendingly even on poor Carrie, whose consternation reached its height as she heard Sydney invite her to be pre- sent at a little repast they had planned for the children who attended the Sabbath class, and even went so far as to ask her opinion of those deemed most deserving of the premiums to be presented by Walter. A year before, Carrie's indignation would have found vent in words and tears. but now amazement made her speechless; and Rose could not suppress a smile as she looked at Carrie's speaking face in which surprise and grief were strangely pic- tured. "We are obliged to you, Dr. Sydney Lawrence, greatly ob- liged," and "oh! brother, how could you do it?" were the greetings that met him when he returned, after having politely bowed out the unwelcome visitor. '; Now Miss Lizzie, do help me to defend myself." said poor Sydney, as Carrie drew her chair to a distance from him, and   180        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. Rose looked at him so reproachfully; " do not you desert me," he pleaded, " but hear, before you condemn me! I heard Mr. Duncan say, this very morning, that Miss Dalrymple must on no account be excluded ; and I knew, moreover, that she would certainly make her appearance among us, welcome or unwel- come. I thought if she were not apprised of our intentions, that she and her colleagues would do all in their power to an- noy us; and do you not agree with me, that it is much better to secure her good-will upon this eventful occasion? Miss Liizie's eyes say yes, and my little Rose has not the heart to differ from her brother, so Miss Carrie you will be obliged to come over to our way of thinking." "I vote that you be condemned to devote yourself, on that day, to promoting the enjoyment and comfort of Miss Mary," said Carrie, who could not easily feel reconciled to that lady's intrusion. "I think Miss Carrie Duncan grows quite tyrannical; I really begin to feel alarmed lest I may be placed permanently on Miss Mary's list, thus excluding me from her presence ever hereafter. I think I shall throw myself on her sister!s mercy, and beseech her to sign a petition for my pardon; but ahll!" he exclaimed, as Mr. Duncan entered the room, "here comes a more powerful pleader to rescue the distressed." "I advise you, dear uncle," said Carrie, "if ever you should desire to illustrate benevolence, to cite Dr. Lawrence, who, for the future intends, in pity for the lonely and desolate condition of Miss Dalrymple, to devote his time and talents to the alleviation of her misfortunes, thereby hoping to win her undying    ,I suppose it will be gratitude." And her merry glance told Sydney, that he was not beyond the reach of pardon, and sent to Walter's heart a thrill that spoke of other days. Her joyous mood had brought the past once more before him, and he left her wondering at Uncle Walter's sad look, when he lingered for a moment to lay his hand so softly on her head.   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        181 The morning of the day, so long looked forward to, dawned bright and clear, and the first sunbeams were joyously hailed by eyes that had scarce been closed hours before their coming; and the gushing song of the birds was echoed sweet, and clear, by young voices, and even older hearts grew glad to hear the sound of childhood's mirth. I It-was just a little out of the village, on verdant tapestry, the simple board was spread; and as the delighted children gathered there, bringing garlands woven since the early morn- ing, all united in proclaiming Carrie "Queen of the Feast." Rose: who had been in the secret, placed the wreath upon her brow, and Carrie bowed in mute surprise, and her inquiring I  glance rested at last on Sydney, who joined in their plot. He was beside her imn an instant. "Does your majesty wish me to return thanks to your lov- ing and royal subjects? or did that bright smile call me hither to hear my condemnation of exile with the Dalrymple'?" "If you do not prove less annoying and more submissive, you shall see it signed and sealed before the day is over," was the playful answer. That was a happy day! Miss Mary smiled, and bowed, and talked more eloquently than was her wont, and forgot the many hours spent in fashioning the new structure on her head, when discoursing amiably, on the vanity of adorning the poor perishing body, to two of the children, in whose blue ribbons, and wild flower-wreaths, she saw alarming symptoms of evil. She was forbearing too. for, to her credit be it said, she did not venture to approach Carrie more than once during the'day, and then avoided awakening her resen tment by a superabundance of words. When Walter proceeded to distribute the rewards prepared for the most studious, she stood beside him, and con- descendingly smiled on the fortunate ones, and with a few special favorites shook hatds very cordially. But happy days, and sad. have alike an ending; and when the sun had gone down in beauty, and the birds had winged 8*   182        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. their flight to their leafy homes-there, in. the still evening, Walter guided the young voices in a hymn of praise to Him who created heaven and earth, and dismissed them, asking God's blessing upon them then and ever. That was a day long remembered; to some its memory faded with death only. So thought Carrie Duncan, as she listened to Sydney when he spoke of days to come which might be brighter yet to him. When she met the fond and earnest gaze then bent' upon her, did she forget another far away? the promise not long since given? Perchance: she even then remembered, for she left his side and sought her sister. But when Sydney came to see them as of yore, though she talked with him less, there were dreamy thoughts, binding her with their spell; and though her step bounded no more to meet him free and fearless, as once it did, her smile of welcome was the same, wakening glad hopes, and fond. Thus, time passed on, he content to lintger, dreading only the time when he should be forced to leave the spot growing daily dearer, yet hoping still that the time to come had much of joy to bless him. Trusting, even thus, another heart, as true and noble, left that same bright spot,-left in confidence and trust one, whom, he deemed too true for change to light on! 7'   CHAPTER VII.

I)DAYS and weeks passed dreamily by, and Carrie lived in the' smile of the present, unheeding the whisper which told of a future that might mar its beauty. She had been weaving flowers into a  garland to please Lizzie who loved to see the bright things twined in her dark curls, but her thoughts seemed   to wander from  her work, for she looked ever and anon from  the casement, and the sunset-rays fell on herbrow giving it strange beauty. The task ended; Lizzie proudly placed it on her head, whispering, "' it was such a pity that Harry could not see her then;" but Carrie turned impatiently from her at the sound of that familiar and once treasured name. A coming footstep made her start, and turn again to the window, but the soft hands that were playfully clasped over her eyes, and the sweet voice that called her name, was scarcely that for which she listened. a Carrie, it  a said, mamma sent me to seek you ; Sydney has gone away, and I   suppose she is lonely, for I am to keep Miss Lizzie company, while you go and cheer her this time."   184        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. "Gone," faltered Carrie; "gone did you say?" "How frightened you look," said the laughing Rose, "he is not gone for always; he is coming back in a few days, I think." An hour later, Carrie Duncan was in the widow's home, listening to strange words' Very beautiful she was, as she sat motionless beside her friend, with the soft color flitting to her cheek, and the light beaming from her eye. The wreath was on her brow forgotten.: Some of the tiny buds had escap- ed from the rest, and nestled unnoted in the soft curls shading her face. Very lovely and beloved was she, yet inexplicable and changeful in her moods as the free wiLds, that sweep thither and hither unguided and unchecked ,save by Him who sent them abroad upon the earth. "I have sent for you, Carrie," said Mrs. Lawrence, " for I would speak to you, as I would have another speak to my own Rose, were I taken from her. I would speak to you of an. other, who would have spoken for himself, but who in his love for me yields his dearest wishes to riy will. You must know, young though you are, how very dear your happiness has grown to him; you must long since have read what his lips would fain utter. It may be, dear child, that the knowledge is not sad; but, I would plead with you both, to think deeply upon the subject; to make no rash vow; to bind yourselves by no promises, that each may regret. I would ask you, for your sake, Carrie, to wait; to listen to your uncle; to heed his wishes and my own;" and she drew the young girl to her side, and continued: "You know that in our home, your pre- sence would be a sunbeam, a blessing, and a joy!" 4"Oh, no! do not say that! you do not know, but you will despise me when you hear all," and Mrs. Lawrence looked on her in wonder, but folded her in her arms, speaking to her tenderly and soothingly, as to a grieved child. "Dear Mrs. Lawrence," she murmured, passionately, " do not hate me, do not forsake me, but pity me! I am not   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         185 worthy of his love, teach him to forget-me, never let him look on me again!" "You must not speak so wildly, do not tremble thus, there is no cause,d we will not talk of this until to-morrow." "No, no, to-morrow, perhaps, I cannot; but now read this, and you will see how I have wronged them both; promised to one, yet listening in joy to another; what have I done?" and she wept bitterly. Mrs. Lawrence read poor Harry's missive, (so full of fond trust, and faith in her whose memory was to him a treasured, holy joy,) and her heart was troubled, yet filled with pity for the poor motherless child, so circled round with love, yet which could not shield her from sorrow. She took the trembling hands in hers and bade her dry her tears, for they could avail her naught. "Carrie, I am sorry for you, and for those to whom you are so dear. I will not reproach you, for sin ever brings its punishment, and I know that yours is repented of. You have been, I' believe, more thoughtless than  unkind; had  you thought of the result, you surely could not have encouraged by thought, word, or look, the affection lavished upon you; but I rejoice that it is not yet too late. Let the past be past, but oh for the future, as you value your own happiness, as you value that of others, guard against the sin of coquetry! for I feel that it is a sin, I, who have seen its fearful doings. You are very lovely! nay, do not turn away; it is a gift which God hath sent, a gift for which you will be called to account, should you make it a snare, luring the trusting and confiding, to leave them at last deceived, betrayed and desolate. These are strange thoughts, perhaps, for one who has looked but on the light of fifteen summers, but let them not be in vain, write them on your inmost heart. For you, I will turn to the sad memories of buried years; they may perchance be a talisman of good, and I will not shrink, even though the task be painful! I had a sister once,   186        BUDS, AND BLOSSOMS. as bright and beautiful a being as ever looked in happiness on earth! We were separated in our childhood. Mine was a peaceful village home-hers, a proud mansion in the vast and peopled city; but sometimes, like a dream of beauty, her presence flitted through our dwelling, leaving me for a time so lonely when it was gone. She was raised, however, in-com- parative seclusion, and flashed upon the world (that is her world) like a meteor, and alas for her, with brightness e'en as transient. She became at once the idol of the crowd, flattered and caressed by the multitude. The transition was too great! She entered eagerly into the gayeties around, drank deeply of pleasure's intoxicating cup, and no conqueror ever looked upon his battles won with greater triumph, than did this dear mis- guided child on the conquests achieved by her rare loveliness. That which should have dimmed her eyes with tears, added to their lustre; the pain given to a fellow-being, the crushing of hopes which she had nourished, until they became almost a reality, was to her but the sport of an hour. At last the witchery of her beauty was shunned, and men of high, noble spirit, who might have gazed on her with rev- erence and love, had the jewel been worthy of its shrine, turned away contemptuously from that heartless thing they named her. But the punishment was yet to come, and very heavily did it fall on the young head. She, who-had spurned the of- ferings of other hearts, who mocked at their affection, was spurned in turn. She, at whose shrine so many bowed in vain, would have laid upon the altar of another heart her own! But the prize was not sought, it seemed not coveted; pride grew strong within her, and angered by the indifference of one, whose every word was treasured, whose every look re- membered, she resolved he should be won. And he was won at last, after days, and weeks, and months, and Ada became. the wife of Morton Lacy. But for what? To be cherished as a flower that the wind might not breathe upon? To be   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        187 treasured as a gem on which no careless eye might look? No! no! but to be wearied of as a new toy, or a jewel the eye tired of; to be thrown aside, and after a time neglected, crushed, 'forsaken. To be left alone with her beauty blighted, not with/ years; left to die unloved, unwept, by the only being she had ever cared for! This was her fate; the young and fair. And now I would ne'er revive the past again, may it no more be needed; but oh, Carrie, do not cease to remember it; let it be a sad, yet truthful beacon on your way, to save you from en- tering into temptation. Never conceal again from those who love you, aught that may for a moment come between you and happiness; and now tell Mr. Duncan of the past, frankly and fearlessly, and believe me it will be better for you, better for-us all." And Carrie did tell him all. In sadness and humiliation told him how she had erred, how she had deceived and dis- obeyed him, pleading for forgiveness, and guidance for ,the days and years to come. Walter forgave and blessed her, and told her how anxiously he had watched her, how he had feared for her, but hope had come once more; he promised to aid and guide her, if she would but love and trust him. He wrote to Harry, and also to Mr. Selden.  To Harry kindly and soothingly, yet, at Carrie's request, concealing nothing of the past; and Harry replied gratefully, but nobly releasing her 'from the promise he had been wrong to gain, trusting, when it should no longer be blamable, at some future time to win the only prize he coveted--asking now but to be remembered in kindness. When it was all over. and Sydney had returned to New-York to enter upon the duties of his profession, Carrie was calmer. and happier than she had been since her early childhood. She seemed changed, too, for even Miss Mary re- marked that Miss Carrie Duncan was much more   lovable now, though, to be sure, she was growing quite a woman, or maybe it was thinking of young Lawrence made her so quiet!   188        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. But Carrie was happier, if not so merry; as joyous, if more thoughtful. Walter watched her fondly and proudly, mark- ing her resolve to do her duty; and when he would draw her so gentiy to his side, calling her "his dear child," she felt more than rePaid   CHAPTER VIII. "'Twas but a word, a simple word, A stranger's lips expressed; And yet my spirit's depths were stirred, With feelings long repressed. Thoughts, rushing thoughts, came wild and fast, The present it was not- I only saw the long, long past, How could it be forgot?" "Wilt thou sit among the ruins With all words of love unspoken, Till the silver cord is loosen'd, Or the golden bowl is broken?" THRE E years passed    swiftly and peacefully away! and so thought Carrie Duncan as, on her eighteenth birthday, she looked back on their revealings! She was far happier, and lovely as her childhood promised, and very fondly Walter gazed upon her, pressing her to his heart, as though  he could not say"farewell, even for a brief space!   Well he knew, in giving her to Gertrude's gentle care, he had naught to fear, yet he turned from the city sadly to his home, leaving behind him those who made its brightness. Lucy Weston had at last been won, and her bridal had as- sembled in her sister's home, a loving, happy band, in the sweet spring-time! Walter had spoken the blessing as he joined   190         BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. their hands, and greeted her the bride of one worthy to be loved, and trusted; for to him Mr. Emmerson was not a stranger. A joyous gathering was there, before that parting, which gave Lucy to another home. Eulalie and Ellerton Les- he had joined them, with Lena, on whom the sisters gazed won- deringly, forgetful that the lapse of years had brought change to them also. Lizzie looked on her as the lovelier semblance of the mother lost, but remembered, oh! so fondly still; and Carrie would clasp her fondly in her arms, kissing her again and again, and wish that Rose could see her. The three were sketched by an eminent artist for Gertrude, and the painting became to Harry Selden a shrine, at which his spirit daily bowed; yet, for the sake of the one loved image, looking forth so lifelike from the still canvas. Lizzie, with her dark hair braided back from her brow, formed a striking contrast to the bright one by .her side. The happiest expression of those speaking eyes-had been caught, and proudly the artist gazed upon his work, as the face of Carrie Duncun grew there in its brightest beauty. Many a lingerer in that quiet studio gazed upon it long, then turned wondering to those beside it, scarce knowing if they could bet- ter love "' the northern star," or the childlike, spiritual face of "the southern heiress!" for so, even thus early, was Lena Leslie styled. "What is to be done to-day in the way of fun and frolic?" questioned Ellerton, one fine morning, looking round on the assembled party very busy doing nothing. No one answered, for, seeming to think only of the present, they left plotting and planning to their elders. "What say you, Mrs. Selden?" continued Ellerton, ad- dressing Gertrude, who had been in earnest converse with Eulalie while the gentlemen glanced over the morning papers. a I do not know," said Gertrude; " but as Lucy and Mr. Emmerson talked of the exhibition of paintings for this after- noon, perhaps we had better join them, and let this thoughtful   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        191 company pass the morning as they list!" and she looked with a happy smile upon them as she spoke. Carrie was winding some bright colored silk, which Harry was holding as awlk- wardly as possible, so that there was little chance of her task being completed very speedily. Mr. Selden proffered his as- istance, but did not seem to do much better, so they sent him away, and he, sought Lena, who welcomed him with a smile, putting aside the game over which she and Lizzie had been puzzling quite long enough. She was soon engaged in an ani- mated discussion on the merits and beauty of Starlight, which resulted in a promise from Mr. Selden to indulge her in her favorite recreation; "for," she said, 'she knew Eulie would trust her with him. Pa was growing old and feeble," she added, archly, "and she could not think of exhibiting him in New-York as an 'equestrian. He might do very well at home, but not here ;"' for which saucy assurance she was threatened very severely by the said gentleman, whose laugh. echoing back her own. contradicted his words. ' Lena was sadly spoiled," he said, looking round for con- dolence, which he did not receive; "Eulalie would let her lhave her own way, but, for his part, he did not intend to be so in- dulgent!" and Lena laughed more joyously than ever, and wondered what would come next. He looked fondly and proud- ly on her, as she nestled to his side, in all the confidence of ever being welcomed there, and told him of so many delightful rides she was going to have yet with that dear Mr. Selden. "Who is the lady now   approaching us, do you know?" asked Sydney Lawrence that afternoon, as linking his arm in that of a friend, they proposed to leave the crowded pro. menade for one more quiet. "'The Southern poetess, Mrs. Leslie," was the reply, "I have seen her several times of late, and also had the pleasure of reading some touching stanzas from her pen. Her name is rarely before the public; her talents being dedicated to home,   192        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.  and home friends. Ah! her daughter is with heir, I see. Is she not lovely . But who can that be i" Lawrence waited to . hear no more, for Carrie Duncan's glance met his, and in an instant he was beside her, and presented to her young sister,  leaving his companion motionless with surprise. Sydney forgot his walk then, but wended his way with them to the gallery. It was the first time they had met for years. Carrie had heard from time to time of his success, and rejoiced for the sake of those who loved him, but now her wild dream seemed over, and surely his must long ago have passed. They entered the saloon where were gathered the works of genius, and turned to look on one, and then another of the mirrored thoughts of those whose gift had been to some a blessing; to some far otherwise. "' Has Miss Mary Dalrymple been pining in my absence" dolefully questioned Sydney, and Carrie's merry laugh his sudden inquiry called forth, attracted the attention of an officer who had been leisurely surveying a portrait near them. He turned with a startled air toward the speaker7 and his  earnest gaze caused Carrie to turn blushing from his scrutiny. "Oh, Carrie, do come here," said Lena, as she stood with clasped hands by Eulalie, before the last work of a young artist, "The Burial at Sea." As one in a dream, the stranger followed the steps of the young girl, who had seemed to bring back the past unto the present. Its many years seemed to have vanished as a vision, making him again the youthful worshipper of one whose voice had been long unheard in earthly homes. And yet, whence came she-this memorial of the past, bearing, too, the very name still so beloved . Charles Walton, over whose head so many storms had passed, forgot all in gazing on the fair girl who stood there looking with a sadder expression upon that last legacy of genius, and unable longer to control his feelings, he approached the group.      I Lady," he said, as Carrie would have turned coldly away,   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        1 3 "forgive me; but that scene reminds me so forcibly of one which I witnessed not many weeks since. I thought, per- chance, its memory might blend with this an added interest, whene'er it is recalled. A more glorious sunset, than mortal limner could ever picture, left its brightness on the waves, as I paced the deck of my ocean-home, musing on the fate of one who had strangely interested me-a youth who, though numbered with the crew, seemed not of them; a fair, slight boy, who soon became endeared to those around, whose only wonder was to see hilm there. He fell a victim to the fever which for a time prevailed in the ship, but lingered for some weeks. Many a rough hand strove gently to smooth his dying pillow, and many an eye that mocked at tears, glistened when he thanked thbm  for their care, but with a sad smile assured them it would not be needed long. He felt his couch would soon be that his father long ago had won-the depths of ocean. He asked to give back to his lonely mother's care the books he loved; to tell her that he did not feel afraid to lie down beneath the deep waves, for he knew that the better part would dwell so far above them. "He went, at last, and in that sunset hour, those who had 'watched and tended his death-couch lowered him gently to his deep, lone home, and left him there not tearlessly, but sadly remembering him as sonme sweet strain, which lingers/ round the heart long after its echo hath died away upon the ear." Lena brushed away the tears, and gazed with new interest on the'painting, linking her hand in Eulalie's, who had not listened all unmoved. "I trust, you will pardon me, but your face seems strangely' familiar," said the narrator of the simple history, approaching Mrs. Leslie. "Do not deem mine an idle question, but were you not long since among the passing visitors at Sharon?" "I was," she replied gently (for that name revived sad memories). "I was there many-many years ago, with a very dear friend, Miss Gilmer, and ----" 9 ,o   194        BUDS. AND BLOSSOMS. "I knew, I knew it could have been no other, and you?" "Eulalie Raimond then,." "I rejoice to meet you, dear Mrs. Leslie! Poor Effie wrote me of your marriage, and the sad scene which followed," he explained, as she returned his greeting surprised at his salutation. "Ah, they have come at last," said Lena, as the rest of the party joined them. Eulalie presented to them Captain Walton, whom- Mr. Selden and Ellerton remembered well, and sadly, yet fondly did they return to by-gone hours, when they were younger, yet scarce happier than now. Gladly Charles Walton accepted the cordial invitation )f Mr. Selden to return with them to their homei where, as often as he cared to seek it, he would ever find a welcome. Willing- ly he joined the glad group, for he had returned to the land of his birth a stranger to all, where all were strangers to him. He had lingered in the city for a few days, and had at last half determined to seek a place among those who braved the dan- gers of the deep, instead of the shore station, which when afar in his weariness he had pined for. But now new hopes were dawning; life seemed to have won for him new beauty, joy long unknown, for when Effie Travers laid her young head on his breast to die, when he placed her fair child in the grave, there was left no living one who could claim him as their own; he had no kindred tie. Bright hopes, sweet dreams, and visions of our youth fade slowly from hearts that cling to, eyes that would nevir turn from them; but not the work of years, or months, or days, is the springing up of fresh buds of loveliness and joy in the place we deemed a very wilderness. Charles Walton would fain have lingered near Carrie Dun- can; but Harry Selden was welcomed there with such a trust- ing, happy glance, he left them and joined Eulalie and Lizzie. The invitation given to him was extended also to Dr. Lawrence, whom Harry met rather coldly at first, but when he saw the   BUDS A'TD BLOSSOMS.        195 reproachful thought in Carrie's eye, greeted him more cor- dially, and it was not very long ere, he seemed as much a fa- vorite with them all as with the happy Lena, whom he amused as they returned, with his experience of a village life, as ecml bellished by Miss Dalrymple. Ellerton catle and joined them to keep Lena in order, he said, lest she should forget that the free and joyous laugh which might ring out unchecked in the southern fields must be subdued in the great city of Ncw- York. Lena pretended to be provoked so prettily, and threatened to laugh on so saucily, that Dr. Sydney Lawrence felt very much like joining her. The hours of that happy evening flit- ted away so swiftly, and when it was ended, reluctant lips breathed good-night wishes, and many a vision came on the wings of sleep to happy pillows, blending with its memories others, strange, and wild, and joyous. Days and weeks were numbered with the many gone be- fore them, and still Capt. Walton lingered; still was he a daily and a  welcome guest among the friends so lately found still he lingered, yet not beside the young and joyous one who had waked him from his loneliness; not now by her. It was with Lizzie that he talked so long and earnestly, with her he might be seen in all the excursions planned for pleasure. At first he sought her to speak of her sister, to hear the loving praise of one who in her youthful beauty was destined to another, for by Harry, at some future time, all thought she would be won, and proudly web thought of her as his. although no promise bound them, and the broken vows of childhood had never been renewed. To all that spoke of her had Walton listened eagerly, but as time passed on, he spoke of himself, seeking to wake an in- terest in the heart of one who heard in mute surprise that she was dear to him. All wondered, when he sought to win her from her home, but far more to know that Lizzie Duncan joyed to be.'the old man's bride," for so Sydney playfully named him. When the dream became reality, and in  solitude   196        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. Lizzie held commune with her own heart, it seemed more strange than words might tell that one like him should care for her. But when she turned from herself to her uncle, she was sad for he would be left so lonely, and Carrie, too, how could she give her up? But when Walter sent a long letter so filled with kind approving words, when hen bade her come and seek his blessing, to linger yet awhile within his home, she thought that life had grown so beautiful, that there would be enough of joy to remember ever, even should clouds and darkness come at last. Oh, it is well that He who placed us here for a brief season should guide us step by step, hiding from our view the long path to be trodden, where no flowers bloom ; the dark shadows that. will hang over it ere we find the blossoms that fade not, or busk in the eternal sunshine. It is well; then why should the lips murmur at His wise decrees, or the heart turn from the present yearning for the days and years to come. Lizzie Duncan's joy had made her strangely forgetful of others. Had she communed less with her own heart, she might have found in the thoughtlessness of one most dear, even cause for teats. Had she watched her sister anxiously, as in past days, she might have stayed the steps now wandering from the better way. Carrie was casting happiness far from her, bringing sor- row unto others. , Yet Lizzie knew it not. She did not dream that she, who nightly prayed :' Lead us not into temptation," was yielding to the whisper of the spirit, against which she had been so fondly warned. She knew not that when her sister's voice in song fell soothingly upon her ear, that the tones were wakened not for the playmate of childhood, the loved of her girlhood. Not for him, but for one with whose peace she had trifled long ago. Harry Selden knew, and felt it all; but not a word or look reproached her who so lately uttered vows he deemed too sa- cred to be broken, and yet could lure again with hopes never to be realized, one who, but for this, had thought of her kindly   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        197 still, but who would not again have sought to be aught more dear than a brother. Had Carrie Duncan remembered the past, with) its fearful warning, all might have been well. Had she listened to the bet- ter voice within, she would have sorrowed bitterly to see estrang- ed one still dear. She would have turned to him then, and for ever, and pursued unweariedly the path of right! She had not meant thus to forget, when in an idle mood she had touched lightly on the past, thus suffering Sydney to recall'it all; to indulge in new hopes for the future. She did not mean it then, but when she forbore to check him; when she listened yet again; when she saw that Harry no longer sought her presence, phe was pained at his indifference, but re- solved that she would never seek to win him back. Sydney lingered near her, still hoping and trusting on; but Harry came not as of yore. Mr. Selden wondered what had come over them. Gertrude's heart was troubled; and drawing Car- rie to her side, one sunny morning, as she stood apart from the rest, she questioned her gently. But when Carrie assured her that there was no quarrel, she left her satisfied, and thought no more of it save as a notion or whim, for which she could not account, but with which it was better not to interfere. Carrie had spoken truly in part, for there had been no words of anger or reproach on either side. She resolved now to talk as joyously, and laugh as merrily as ever with Sydney, for Harry would soon weary of missing her, and she did not intend to notice his caprices. But a long letter from Rose woke her to a consciousness of the wrong she was doing the loved son and 'brother of whom she wrote so fondly. Her heart grew heavy, and in her sorrow she wondered why she was allowed to. live; she, who was such a grief to others. When she marked the calm and quiet joy of Lizzie, she would turn away from -happiness she could no longer share, longing for the gentle words of forgiveness which she was yet too wil- ful or too proud to seek. And oft when stranger eyes rested admiringly upon her,   198        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. marvelling at the strange and flashing glance which answered theirs, or the words which seemed a very gush of joy from her lips, she -would turn away despising the loveliness she knew to be so marred by the evil heart it shrined. Often when her young sister slept calmly by her side, she would bend fondly over her and rest her throbbing brow upon the cool fair cheek, and yearn for the innocent purity of the unconscious dreamer. Alas for those, who, conscious of wrong, yet blindly and wilfully refuse to turn away, who will 'not seek the way of truth and happiness! Alas for the wayward heart, which seals the lips, checking the words which might win it rest and peace! Carrie grew restless as time passed on, fearing that others might read the struggle in her heart. And at last, in a pas- sionate burst of tears, she threw herself into Lizzie's arms and pleaded to go home again to Walter. Her inquiries she re- fused to answer. "She must go home," was all that she would say, " she was weary of the city, she wanted rest and quiet." Vainly did they urge her to abandon this sudden resolve; she did not heed them. Eulalie and Lena were to return with Gertrude to Glenwood ; but Carrie cared not, to her all places were the same where dwelt Harry Selden and Sydney Lawrence, she only wished to be where they were not. These were her thoughts, but they were buried deep in her own heart, and none guessed them even when the parting came, and Harry bade her farewell with the others. None knew how much it cost them both, that careless seeming. Her heart was heavy as she turned away, but Harry did not know it; how should he, when she smiled so brightly to Sydney, and waved her hand so joyously when he bade her watch for his coming. Capt. Walton looked on her wonderingly, yet kindly, though he could have loved her more had she consulted his wishes. leaving him her sister's presence yet a little longer. He con- soled himself with the reflection that in a brief space it would be restored again, and he bade Lizzie Ywatch also for a coming, yet not such as Sydney's might prove to Carrie Duncan.   CHAPTER IX "Life has import more inspiring Than the fancies of thy youth; It has hopes as high as Heaven, It has labor, it has truth. It has wronas that may be righted, Noble deeds that may be done, Its great battles are un fought, Its great triumphs are unwon." THE father and the son stood once more upon the terrace of Glenwood, which lay before thenl in all its summer beauty, and their words were earnest yet subdued to softness by the calmness of the hour. Edward Selden looked fondly on   his child, and yet there was an anxious expression blending with that deep affection, and Harry met his glance with one that spoke of some firm and high resolve. "Father," he said, linking his arm in Edward's, "I would speak to you now of myself, and I do not fear that you will coldly turn from words of mine. Your question not long since aroused me from a dreamy listlessness. I have been living in the past, forgetful that the future hath higher, nobler aims. I   thank you for the awakening. You spoke of that future's calling. I have pondered long upon your words, and when in earnestness I   questioned my own heart, its every answer came even as did the first. It urges me to turn no longer from the voice which bids me go forth into the world as said the Holy   200        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. One, teaching unto men the way of life, life eternal. Father, I will be God's messenger," and his voice grew stronger and sweeter, and his upward glance grew eloquent with the holy feelings thrilling his youthful heart. And Edward Selden breathed a silent thanksgiving that this the child of so much love, of such bright hopes, had not been loved and watched and guided all in vain. But his task was not yet ended; still must he guide and counsel, until his child should pass from his care, directed by a mightier hanfI, and shielded by far greater love.  "I bless our God," he said (fondly pressing the hand now clasped in his), " that He has thus spoken to your heart His holy will. I rejoice to think that you may yet be the winner of precious souls, pleading the love of Him who hath redeemed us. My heart o'erflows with gratitude to your Father and to mine, to my God and your God. But think well, my' child, of all His word requireth, of all that you must be; the many sacrifices which must joyfully be made; the severing of the i fondest ties; the forgetfulness of self; the faith which must not falter, clinging closer to the cross, when clouds and darkness intervene. Think of all, Harry, and then should hope and trust still be strong, urging you onward and up- ward; then shall my blessing be your right, my grateful prayers go with you. ' It will be very sad to give you up, but we must aid each other to forget the idol self, and make a shrine on the heart's altar, for His dear love, who gave us all. I will strive to yield cheerfully, for His work, the treasure He - hath given." "I have thought of all, and more than you have dreamed of. I have remembered the past with its joys and blessings, blessings which remained not, joys which have faded. I placed my happiness in the keeping of one whom I vainly trusted; one fair and bright as a most blissful dream. But when I seemed nearer to the prize, when I deemed it all my own, I saw the smiles and words I had so treasured lavished   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        201 upon another, unheeding my sorrow; and then indeed my spirit failed, my heart grew heavy, life seemed aimless. I have read you the saddest page in my heart's history, and we will close it now; and al-ways. An earthly treasure lured me; for la tiime the Creator was forgotten in the creature; but the past is past; I am stronger now, and you, my father, must pray that my treasure be henceforth in heaven!" EIdward Selden bowed his face for a brief space, and when lhe looked up again to answer those confiding words, he was alone. With an eager, trembling step. he sought Gortrude to pour into her ear the tidings which had saddened anld yet re- joiced his heart. And then, amid the smiles and tears so strangely blending, they turned to the past with its thrilling mcmories!  Edward spoke of the weary time, when his soul had been shrouded in darkness; when   the word of truth brought no meaning to his ear, no conviction to his heart; when the tongue which now praised had refused to own a God. As the waves of years gone by, rolled backand laid before him his past Sinfulness, lie blessed the mercy which had spared him to see his child treading the path which leads unto right- eousness and salvation. The mother's heart yearned wildly toward her son, and earthly feelings for a time had sway. But Gertrude did not murmur; she looked to Him who   had ever sustained her, seeking submission to His will. When Harry came for her approval (thanking her for the teachings of his childhood, which were now strengthening and blessing his early manhood), she folded her arms lovingly about him, and prayed that even thus the everlasting arms might ever encircle hin; that the all-seeing eye of love might follow him when he should be no longer in their lonely home. Harry wished to pursue his theological studies without delay, and Mr. Selden wrote to obtain from Walter letters to an eminent divine, well known to him. Harry desired that a few lines to Carrie might be inclosed, and smiled sadly, re-   202        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. plying to his father's inquiring gaze, "Do not fear for me, I i have but done my duty."' And she to whomn that missive sped read it in brokenness of heart, feeling how all unworthy she had proved of the trust reposed in her. She felt that when those words (so tremu- lously traced) bade her once more be free, his heart had cast her from him. He, whose esteem was far above the love of others, was from henceforth to be to her a stranger; and the  blessing he had asked for her e'en there; came chillingly unto her heart, for then she knew that they were parted. X Had he, who had thus conquered the wavering of his heart; who had deemed she would be happier, if he resigned her to another; had he seen her as she excluded herself from the presence of all, and with that crushed sheet clasped in her hand, her head bowed in remorse and shame; had he seen her then and read the tumultuous feelings warring so wildly in her heart, he might even then again have trusted, even then his purpose might have faltered. But to all were those thoughts and feelings a sealed book. When, hours after, Car- rie Duncan had left remaining no vestige of those written words, when, with a step that did not falter, she went with Walter to the abode of sickness, of sorrow. and of want; or when in the twilight hour, in her own dwelling. Sydncy Law-  rence pleaded for some loved lay, and her voice blended with that of Rose in the joyous melody, none guessed that all to her was averymockery,that the low wordsbreathed in her ear as Syd- ney fondly bent above her, but added to the misery in her heart. When the hour of parting drew near, and he lingered to say once more " good night," there was a brightness in her eye, and a wildness in her words that startled him; and he would have spoken, but she laid her hand in his, and though its icy touch chilled him, he said nothing, but pressed it fondly to Iris lips, for she had implored him, in that whispered tone, to leave her and be silent. But in the still night-watch, her wild, strange murmurs /     BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        203 roused the sleeper beside her; and when her name was called, a ringing laugh made answer. Tremblingly, Lizzie hastened to summon Walter. for Carrie Duncan knew not the voice. heeded not the tears falling fast above her. Days and nights, which seemed to have no ending, passed wearily, and still to those who watched, the life of the young girl seemed aoout to pass in darkness. Ealahe had been summoned from Glenwood, and Lena, her bright face wet with tears, was ever by her sister's side. Harry's name, blended with blessing and farewell, trembled oft upon her lipsi but then, '-Sydney, dear Sydney," would she murmur again and again, and those who clustered round her knew not what to think. Sydney watched and waited, yet dreading ever the unchanging response to his still repeated inquiries. The prayers, breathed so fervently for the life precious unto many, went not up in vain,--and once more Carrie look- ed on the loved faces that were near her day and night, and looked on them in consciousness. Very slowly she regained strength, but all things seemed void of interest. She scarcely spoke, save in answer to their words, and to those whom she best loved was strangely indifferent. She would pass hours in silence, desiring to be alone, and they often found her in tears, but she would hastily brush them away, and appear calm again. Sydney pleaded for admission, but she would not see him; and sadly, strangely altered, seemed the once bright darling of the village. She had been sitting one morning by the window, with Lena on a low cushion at her feet looking mournfully in her pale face, as she fondly smoothed her hair, and bent ever and anon to kiss her cheek. At last, with a heavy sigh, she turned to Eulalie who was reading to them, and said: '"I was think- ing, dear Mrs. Leslie, how I should love to go back with you.   204        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. Will you take me to your home; and teach me to be like Lena?" "( Will you indeed go with us?" was the glad reply; "I have been entreating your uncle to give you to my care, but though even willing to part with you, for your sake he feared the suggestion might not please you. But you will go, and we shall strive to make you happy, and I fear Lena's cup of joy will be full to o'erflowing!" Lena's delighted exclamations bespoke her happiness, as she fondly embraced her sister and spoke so joyously of the many pleasures they would share. A smile at her childlike earnestness, made Carrie just herself again, Rose said; but the smile did not linger, for with the entrance of her friend, painful thoughts seemed to come again, and she hastily left the room; saying she was not so strong as she had thought. Eulalie followed, and would have remained near her, but she pleaded to be left alone. There was quite an excitement in the village, when Carrie's departure drew nigh. Mrs. Lawrence marked in silence the busy preparations, but her heart misgave her when she noted Sydney's sad and thoughtful demeanor, and Carrie's cold in- different manner. She forbore to question either, and poor Rose grieved unchecked, unchided. Miss Mary Dalrymple put on a very important air, but as her offers of assistance were generally declined, she could only flit from house to house, and report progress to the curious. Lizzie was very sad, for this parting was so unexpected, yet not less necessary, for Carrie refused to go, if her uncle were left alone, and it was best not to oppose her. The day before she left Geneva, Carrie Duncan sent for Sydney, and long hours elapsed ere he left her. He had obey- ed the summons joyfully, and trustingly; but when he turned from the parsonage, his step was less glad, yet to his mother's   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        205 inquiries he replied :-"Mine has been a happy dream; it is over now; yet I cannot blame, but pity and forgive her!" There were tears on Carrie's cheek when he left her, yet she murmured, as she bowed her head, "I could not falter, and now, perchance, all may yet be well." Together they left the village; Sydney Lawrence returning to his duties with more fixed resolve, yet followed by the me- nory of a pale, changed face, and Carrie Duncan seeking in a southern clime, 'mid stranger scenes, strength alike for the spirit and its shrine. Another home had been left lonely. Gertrude and Edward Selden turned to all that spoke of the self-exiled with a cling- ing love.' All that had ever won from him an interest, became to them something to be treasured for his sake. But not idly and despairingly did they fold their hands, or bewail their loss. Not such the light in which they viewed the severing of this loved tie. As those who have dedicated to the Most High the heart's best treasure, strong in His strength, they went upon their way, aiding the needy, sustaining the friendless. Far and near was Gertrude's name become a very house- hold blessing. Matrons looked on her in love, and strove to 'follow in her steps; and little children heard her gentle coun- sel, shrining it in their hearts, and it became as bread cast upon the waters, which was found after many days. 9*   CHAPTER X. uI waste no more in idle dreams, my life, my soul away; I wake to know my better self-I wake to watch and pray! Oh! still within, the inner veil, upon the spirit's shrine, Still unprofaned by evil burns the one pure spark divine, Which God has kindled in us all, and be it. mine to tend Henceforth with earnest thought and care, the light that lamp may lend!' IT was the evening hour, the hour when a happy group had been wont to assemble at the parsonage-but its most joyous spirit was missing, its sweetest voice was listened for with that wild yearning with which the heart turns to its best beloved and absent. Carrie's name was breathed again and again, and thought was busy in its flight to her new home.   Months had elapsed since they sent her from   their sheltering love to a sunnier clime, trusting that where the flowers bloomed fairest, their drooping plant might win new     strength and beauty. Very often were they gladdened by happy missives, telling of new hopes won with purer trust; so, in her happiness, they strove to be content, looking the more earnestly to the time which would restore her once again. The sun had long since set, the darkness came stealing over all his beams had brightened, and one by one the night gems shone afar in the azure dome. All things were hushed, and a holy spell seemed cast upon that gathered group, who looked upon the night.   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        207 Charles Walton gazed upon the outer world, but dimly seen, then turned gladly to the light within, where, close be- side him, was his all of joy. Walter looked on them with a blessing, silent yet sincere, and prayed that their joy might ne'er be blighted, as had been his own; and yet there was no murmuring thought, no shade of gloom for when that bright, bright link was broken, such long years ago, he knew full well it was but for a time; a brief time now-and then, unfettered by aught of earth, the united spirits should rejoice for ever! The darling of her home, she, whose name was never breathed, save as a joy, in that same hour was dreaming e'en of them. With her young sister, Carrie looked forth on a scene of loveliness, and yet in thought wandered from its beauty to those whom she had left; and fond imaginings of what the future yet might be came to cheer her. She had formed new 'ties, new associations, but they had no spell to lure her heart from home's loved treasures. These could not blot out the records of the past; they must live on, and even while she sighed, she felt that it would be well were that shadow ever by her side, a warning in temptation's hour. Carrie had grown wiser and better, yet she mistrusted her own heart, and feared to heed its whisperings. From the hour when she turned from all she so much loved, had she nobly striven to conquer the evil spirit within, and when first she folded her hands to pray in secret for strength to resist all evil, a new light seemed to dawn for her, a new and joyous hope was won, and in that hour she resolved to turn to the better way, to lean not to her own understanding, but trusting in One all powerful to aid, all merciful to hear the penitential sigh of one of the least of his children. Fondly did Eulalie watch over her; Mrs. Leslie took her to her heart and blessed her, and Carrie learned to love her well, and often with Lena would sit for hours beside her lis- tening unweariedly to the histories of other years, looking up to her almost with veneration, as she told of the Carrie of old ;    208        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. time, of her glad life, her winning ways, and how triumphantly at last she went from them. As time passed on, Carrie Duncan regained health and strength; the mind was renovated, the spirit purer, and the shrine more lovely still, and Lena clung to her so fondly, looking to her for aid and guidance ever. "Carrie" (said the sweet voice greeting her in the early morning), " good news from Eulie. Mrs. Glanville has sent for us to grace her fete, and we are both to go. Now will it not be joyous?" and her eyes brightened with the anticipated pleasure. "Lena will go, she will not miss me there, and I shall not feel lonely, when I think that she is happy!' But the bright face was saddened, and turning her arms about her sister's neck she pleaded for her presence; and to that whispered entreaty, "Lena will not be glad without you," Carrie yielded and, happy again, the merry maiden was busily intent on some secret enterprise. Mrs. Glanville resided in the neighboring town; she had shown an interest in Eulalie. and became to her a dear friend from the time she had risked her displeasure in chiding her indulgence to Lena. One only son was the bright tie that bound her heart to earth. In early life she had been bereft of all that makes life lovely. An orphan -and a widow, very desolate she seemed. The hoarded gold and the broad lands bequeathed her, could not fill the young heart's aching void, or bring back the lost and loved. For a time she yielded to despair, and shutting herself out from the world refused the companionship of others and brooded on her griefs. But her child sickened, and she roused to energy, strengthened by the very fear lest this last treasure should be riven; her thoughts were turned from self. The faithful minister, whose teachings she had long heard un-   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.          209 moved, came to her in her desolation, and his prayers by the sick couch of the boy, were blessed unto the mother. Ignace became her dearest care; fondly she nursed him again to health, watched over all his steps, made him the com- panion of her solitude, and as years passed and the boy be- came a man, a blessing did he seem unto his mother's heart. The fete of which Lena spoke, was yearly celebrated on the anniversary of his birth; she was wont to summon those dear to her and to him to share in the festivities of the even- ing; and amid the throng, her eyes followed fondly the one being, to her, better and dearer than all others. In her child her brightest hopes were centred; on him her heart's deep treasures lavished, and fondly he returned a mother's holy love. Her comfort, her happiness, was ever his first care; to ful- fil her wishes, his greatest joy. From a child, he was gentle and thoughtful beyond his years; as a man, noble, unselfish, and considerate of others, he was beloved and esteemed by all who knew him. With Eulalie and Ellerton he was a favor- ite, and Lena had ever joyously welcomed his coming. But Carrie turned from him, all winning as he was-avoided, or met him with studied coldness, which was a source of wonder and regret to even Lena, who said, 4"she could not imagine how any one could forget to listen when Ignace was talking." And yet her very coldness seemed to win him,.and one little sentence from her lips to repay him for hours of silence. He had earnestly yet timidly Solicited her presence at the festival, but she politely excused herself, assigning no reason, and he did not venture to urge his request, It was the custom of those who had formerly assembled on this occasion to bring some simple offering, or rather gift, in token of respect or affection for Mrs. Glanville. Lena's fingers had been busy for some weeks on a wreath intended for her dressing room, formed of mosses and leaves of every varied shade; it was an ingenious and fairy fabric, and its progress   210        'BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. had interested the whole household; even Linda was triumph. antly summoned by her young favorite to look at and approve her handiwork. She had prepared a gift for Ignace, but she said she did not intend they should see that; her remark elicit. ed a smile and was forgotten, for she was frequently engaged in weaving chains for this dear friend. Carrie had declined accompanying her friends, but Lena's disappointment seemed so great that, fearing to excite remarks by her absence, she concluded to join them, and, on the event- ful evening, speedily arranged her own simple yet graceful at- tire to aid in the decoration of the darling Lena. She found Eulie with her, and Linda, exercising all the patience with which she was endowed, was striving to smooth into order her soft hair. It was a wearisome task, too, for the little head seemed like a bough swayed by the wind, to which rest was unknown. Carrie exchanged places with her, and the work was speed- ily accomplished.                     J A joyous band had gathered to do honor to the young Ig- nace Glanville. The spacious apartments were thrown open, and matrons, congregated here and there, discussed matters of interest to such, while the young in scattered groups were hold-. ing lively converse. A murmur of surprise and admiration attracted the atten- tion of the merriest, when Eulalie with her little party entered the room, and were cordially welcomed by the hostess. It was the first time Carrie had appeared among them, and save to a very few she was a stranger. She was ere long sur- rounded by those eager to do homage to grace and love- liness, but even though the voice which made answer to their warm greetings was low and sweet, yet the words were strange- ly indifferent, and many who had bowed to the spell of beauty soon turned from her to Lena, contrasting the northern and the southern flower, attributing the cold seeming of Carrie to the chill clime from whence she came, thinking how very lovely 17!   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        2" she would be, warmed into life and feeling. They could not know how great had been the effort to check the smiles, and words fresh from the heart springing ever to the lips. They knew not how dangerous to her peace had proved impulsive acts, leading her for the pleasure of the moment thoughtlessly to win the meed of admiration, or read too late the deep feel- ings of other hearts. She had suffered, and this had been her schooling. She had marred the happiness of more than one, and was resolved never, by word, or look, or tone, to seek a strang- er's notice. She, whose heart yearned for affection ever, now shrank from their every look or word, and those who knew her not, named her cold, indifferent, and even void of feeling. But she felt that though they wronged her she had deserved far greater censure, and she feared to advance one step to unde- ceive them, lest the power of the past should again win strength, She went, after a time, from the saloon to the adjoining room, laid her gift upon the table among other offerings, and was passing into the verandah to seek Lena, but she was stayed by hearing her own name spoken by her sister. Fearing to in- terrupt her, she retraced her steps, wondering what Lena had found to say of her to Ignace. She would have been surprised had she heard. He had playfully demanded of Lena his souvenir. after as- sisting her to place his mother;s where it'could be seen to ad- vantage. She laughed, and assured him that he was not forgot- ten, exhibiting, at the same time, a curiously carved case, from which she drew a dark and lighter curl, tied fancifully together. He took it in surprise. "Your own hair, Lena? what a treasure! but this is not yoirs; whose can it be?" and he was separating them. "Stop, stop, Ignace! you must not spoil Carrie's pretty ncudc." "Carrie! did she give you this for me?" '"No, certainly not!" laughed Lena, and left him to wonder on; but he followed her, and when Carrie found them, was   212        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. insisting on knowing how she came to think of giving him such a token. "You are very persevering, Mr. Ignace Glanville! but I was really tired of seeing those eyes of yours wandering from my curls to Carrie's; so I thought you had better have one of each to look at all the time!" "You interpret very strangely, Miss Lena, the roving of one's eyes; I shall take care to watch very closely, in future, the movement of yours. But did your sister know all this?" "Did I not tell you no? How strange you are, Ignace! I asked for a ringlet, and she gave it to myself, not you; I cut my own and she tied them for me, without asking such tire- some questions; but if you do not like my gift, you can just return it, and I will keep it for some one who can prize it!" "You will just do no such thing, you darling little fairy! but let us seek the others lest they imagine that the spirits of the night have made way with us." They were proceeding gayly to the saloon, but seeing Car- rie standing alone near a window, Lena insisted that her com- panion should do penance for his tormenting. t"Carrie!" she began, as Carrie turned with one of her brightest smiles, at the sound of her voice, seeming surprised and amused at her threatening words to the captive by her side. "What have you been doing to Mr. Glanville, now, Lena?" she asked. "Just nothing at all, but making him a beautiful present, for which he is so unthankful. I intend taking it away," "Now you know very well, Lena," commenced poor Ignace, embarrassed beyond measure--"Now you know very well," in- terrupted she,% that it is no use to deny it ; when I told him it was your hair, Carrie, he crushed it in his hand, and that was the last I saw of it!" "My hair, Lena! what can you mean?" "Yes, your hair; the curl you gave me. I gave it to Ignace with mine."   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         213 e"But you did not say you intended it for any one else. I trust Mr. Glanville will not think I sanctioned such a pro- ceeding; you have done very wrong;" and she turned from them to rejoin Eulalie, who had wondered at her absence. '"Now, I have done some mischief," murmured Lena, look- ing after Carrie, marvelling at her companion's agitation. "You must take back the curl, Lena," he said at lasti " not yours-I cannot part with that; but it is not right that I should retain your sister:s if she does not wish it." The evening wore on, very joyously to some, but wearily to others, and most of all to him for whose pleasure they were convened. Lena proposed that tickets should be drawn from her magic vase, on which were inscribed some playful mandate, and threat- ened severe penalties to all who should dare disobey them. Many of the tasks with their performance proved amusing, and all seemed interested in the progress of the game. A very old lady was desired to dance a minuet with a very young gentleman, who looked exceedingly frightened; but the lady refusing to act her part, was doomed to forfeit her spec- tacles, which were reluctantly yielded to the merry and merci- less judge. Ellerton's task proved to be an impromptu sonnet, which he gave with more grace and gravity than attention to metre or rhyme, but which elicited merry peals of laughter from the audience. Ignace was desired to ask a boon of his nearest neighbor. Carrie Duncan was just beside him, and he unhesi- tatingly demanded a song. "Now, Carrie, do your best," said Lena, joyously, " that is the command of this very last card which falls to you, for every one else has been supplied. Do not venture to shake your head, or you will see a pair of scissors in alarming contact with your curls ;" and the privileged pet descended from her elevated position and followed her to the instrument, whisper- ing, as she seated herself near her, "Sing the new song Eulie wrote for usa"   214         BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. Carrie sighed as she played a sweet prelude, for she was thinking of one who had so loved to hear her sing at even-tide; but these were no memories for such hour, and she sent thei back to the heart's casket to be enshrined for solitude's com- munings, and the hum of voices ceased with her first glad notes. I'll sing when the day is dawning, When the sunbeams kiss the earth; When the birds look up to heaven I'll join in their wild-wood mirth. I'll sing, foir my heart is happy, And my spirit hath a tone Of thankfulness and blessing, Of love, and of joy alone. I'll sing when the stars are looking On earth with its many homes, Far down from their own blue dwelling Where the death-shade never comes. I'll sing when the song-bird ceaseth, When fadeth away the light, And lookipg up toward heaven I'll sing my last good-night I The circle around her gained in numbers ere the song end- ed, and. those who had before turned from her, wondered how they could have deemed void of feeling one whose face was now brightened by joyousness that gushed from each full tone. She sang again and again, leaving pleasant memories with those whom she had never met before, and whom, perchance, she might not see again: The guests parted, lights grew dim, and the bright wreaths withered! Weary eyes sought repose, and young hearts were beating on as joyously in the fairy world of dreams. The festival was with the things of the past, and its memo- ries, to some, blending with bright ones yet to come. Glad voices, sweet visions, whither have ye vanished!

Carrie, rejoicing in her sister's happiness, delayed not its consummation by her absence. Lena insisted on not being left behind, and Ellerton gravely advised that the house should be closed, while the mixed multitude, appertaining to the es- tablishment, should journey in a caravan-like manner, led by Lena and Starlight. But Mrs. Leslie hushed the laugh raised against him, and thought her plan a better one. He should remain at Bellevue to protect Mrs. Glanville and herself, while Ignace, who con- templated a Northern tour, should accompany Eulie and the girls-a plan which seemed to meet such general approbation, that Carrie said nothing, though she could have wished it otherwise a ranged-and so it was at last settled. The quiet wedding was over. Lizzie was married and gone. and with her the two young brideinaids, so passing fair in their childlike grace. Eulalie and Ignace went also in the bridal train, for Eulie could not believe Lena in safety away from her; and Mrs. Lawrence, who had never been separated from. Rose, rejoiced that it should be so. Carrie passed through the deserted rooms when all was over, putting carefully aside each mute memorial of her sister, feeling very sad and desolate; but, checking her tears, resolv- ed bravely to bear up for Walter's sake. When she thought of him, how lonely he would 'have been with neither of them near to cheer him, there was no regretful feeling that she had remained. There was a calmn joy within her heart, a consciousness of difficulties vanquished, evil overcome, of wrongs somelwhat righted, duties no longer neglected. Walter had ma,'rked it all, and knowing full well how great must have been the struggle to change that proud rebellious spirit to its meek lovingness,   218         BUIDS AND BLOSSOMS. ascribed gratefully, with her, praise to Him who is able to suc- cor the tempted. There was a shade upon each brow as they sat together that evening in the dim twilight, for each heart was full, but it did not linger. It was the first time since her return that they had thus found opportunity, freely to converse upon the past, and there was so much for each to hear, for each to say. Car- rie, with frank confiding trust, opened her heart's folded page to the eye of one who had ever read leniently, and new hopes dawned for the future, and Walter sent her to rest that night with a happier heart, and a warmer blessing than he had breathed, even in her orphaned childhood; and when the day- light greeted her, it had not vanished, but remained to give new energy to the steps treading in the better way, adding brightness to the joys and duties of home's holy sphere.. She had a gentle greeting even for Miss Mary, striving to find kindly motive in the offer to remain with her during Liz- zie's absence; but Carrie had too much to think of and emlploy her, to feel lonely yet, so Miss Dalrymple chatted awhile about the wedding, admired the bride, criticised the guests, and de- patted with an injunction to Carrie to keep up her spirits un- til she came again. With the evening came a more welcome visitor, one who could enter into her feelings, who had known much of her past years. Carrie had ever been dear to Mrs. Lawrence, and now that she knew how nobly she conquered, remembered how deeply she had suffered for the folly of her girlhood andu looked with fonder love on one whom she would fain have called her child, she bade her God speed in this new path, cheered and soothed her, telling of flowers yet to spring up there which should be gathered thornless to her heart. And Carrie listen- ed and believed, and still hoped on. New duties were devolving on her, but new pleasures which they brought, formed sweet reward for their fulfilment. Where Lizzie had been wont to tend Carrie was found follow.   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         219 ing in her steps, and never seemed that young voice sweeter ;,unto Walter's ear, than when it ministered words of consola- t ion to some thirsty soul, never seemed the fair face lovelier than when in some low dwelling it bent -above the bed of sick- ness. The old villagers laid their' trembling hands upon the young head, that grew so thoughtful of their wants, and blessed the heart that could feel for them in their sorrow. Such words of praise were far dearer than the homage given to her gayer but not happier hours, for now she akas happy, and though at times a thought of the past would cast a shade upon the pros- ent, the sigh sped quickly, and she joyed that brighter love and peace were won, even through suffering. In the house of prayer, where years ago she had gone with those now parted, she knelt in the accustomed place alone, or listened to Walter's message from on high, which, time after time, he spoke to their hearts, pure and true as when from the Eternal Throne it was sent unto the little band who had fol- lowed the earthly steps of God's dear Son. Still, as then, it fell on varied soil; some on stony ground; some falling where after a time it sprung up and withered away, but some of the pre- cious seed thus sown, in after days brought forth fruit a hun- dred-fold. Walter was well beloved by the little flock among whom he had so faithfully labored, whose spiritual welfare had been his earnest care.  He felt that could he but live as God hath taught to those who love Him ; could he but win some souls to cling to His dear cross, who had laid down His life to redeem them, who had poured out his soul unto death for the sins of the whole world; could he but accomplish good in the name of Him who sent him; then, he felt that the sorrows of earth would be but as dreams, shadows melting away in the light of the "Sun of Righteousness." He lived for God. His fear was ever before his eyes; his Father's house on high the end of all his labors, and his exceeding great reward. And thus living: his pure example was not vain; it en-   220        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. forced the precepts which he taught, and -remained long after he had vanished from among them. While Carrie Duncan kept unfalteringly the pointed way, seeking to win good for herself and others, Harry Selden, just entered into the ministry, was thrilling with his eloquence the hearts long since unreached by holy words. Crowds flocked to hear the teachings of one so young, yet so zealous for the cause of God, and his name passed from lip to lip, and he was sought by the rich and gay, the high and great of earth, who knowing naught of " the unsearchable riches of Christ," mar- velled at the wondrous power won by this youthful tongue, to move them all at will. Gertrude heard in fear and trembling of the name he bad won unsought, and while she rejoiced that this dear child should be one among God's servants, chosen for His mighty work, she prayed that he might not be led into temptation, that the offered homage of the children of the world might but drive him nearer to the Saviour's side. She wrote to bless him, to warn him of the dangers which were gathering round, to urge him more than ever to obey the apostle's injunction, " to pray without ceasing." Harry would con o'er and o'er the precious missives, and send back his winged thoughts to reassure her, acknowledging his weakness, which yet was strengthened of God, and asking in. his behalf the prayers which had never ceased to plead for him, since first, a precious bud, to be loved, watched, and reared for a brighter land, he had been laid upon her bosom! "Whom, think you, should we meet in our travels, dear Carrie?" wrote Lena to her sister, " whom but Mrs. Brandou, our darling mother's old preceptress, and very old she looks too, through all the rouge she lays on so unmercifully, and for all the teeth, passing for hers, are as white as your own. You do not know how strangely I felt, when she was talking to me, \  not that her voice was so sweet, for it had a strange resem- blance to poor old Uncle Eb's beloved fiddle with the large   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        221 gap in it, (and be sure you do not let me forget to take him a new one,) but then she spoke of mamma, whoml I so love without remembering! Euhe was quite a baby, and I kissed away the tears, wishing that Madame Brandon's departure was near at hand. She talked incessantly of the time when Eulic was a girl, and the poor thing seemed so happy, it was a pity to tire of her, but Rose and I did grow weary, and went with Ignace to look out upon the beautiful scenery. She kissed us all before she left us, telling us again it made her feel old to see us sprung up like flowers in the place of those who seemed such a little while ago happy children. ' Rose is calling, so I must just put away this letter for Eulie to finish. I suppose Ignace is not very far off, but I must go and look after them both."  Eulie finished this as well as many other of Miss Lena's undertakings, and dwelt more fully on this unexpected meeting--on the memories of old it awakened, the associations of childhood all clustering around this faded relic. She sorrowed too, to see one so near life's last step, so intent upon its vanities. She pitied the aged being, so unprepared for the eternity just before her, so unconscious of its deep revealings; and she parted with her sadly, breathing a prayer for one going down to the deep night of the grave, with no light upon its gloom. She wrote more cheerfully of Lizzie, whom they had left in her new home, which surely must be a happy one, for they left her with one whose every thought seemed to be of care for her. They were extending their tour farther than they had at first intended; but Rose and Lena seemed so happy, and so much improved, that she could not refuse to indulge them; but if she was very lonely, a word would hasten their return. She would try poor Ellerton's patience no longer! But Carrie was not very lonely. In her leisure hours she had books and music, and then there were long walks with Mrs. Lawrence and Walter, and something of, interest always to prevent " ennui." So they might keep on in the bright   222        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. spring-time, and enjoy the beautiful things of earth, and think of her, not as wearying on the hours alone, but as busy in the morning as the flitting birds, and in the evening with sweet memories to muse over, kind faces to look on, and loving words to answer back her own. Sydney Lawrence had found leisure to join his sister for a brief time, and Rose seemed almost wild with joy, and she threw herself into her darling brother's arms. and Lena helped her to be merry, greeting him gladly as an old and valued friend. He looked on her in surprise; the playful child he had parted from was grown so lovely, and he traced in her sunny face a resemblance to Carrie, which no one else could see! They were a happy company who thus journeyed on, joying in the present, gleaning from all around, about them, thoughts to be treasured in time to come. Leaves and flowers were gathered to be put away as bright mementoes, then thrown aside as those more lovely met their roving eyes. Other parties travelling like themselves for pleasure, yet seeking it not thus, having not its germs in their own hearts, wondered what they saw in such trifling' things to admire or be amused with; and yet many would find an irresistible spell in their very joyousness, and almost involuntarily give back answering smiles to the bright faces turned full oft to read their own. Miss Mary Dalrymple was growing very thoughtful; she seemed not so fond of going to and fro as had been her wont, attending disinterestedly to every body's affairs for lack of any of her own. Some very uncharitable, heartless body; told Carrie Duncan that the poor thing was growing rheumatic, and Carrie in the simplicity of heart never doubted the truth of the statement, and kindly offered the supposed invalid a valuable specific, the wondrous efficacy of which she had seen tested; which well intentioned act brought such a storm of words on her devoted head, as prompted her to a hasty retreat.   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        223 "Rheumatic!"It was an insult which required all Miss Mary's Christian fortitude to meet; forgive she might, but for- ,get she did not think she ever could. But a new idea had dawned upon her, having lately read an account of the deep interests, created somewhere, by some- body, in the heart of an elderly gentleman by an interesting young invalid. Her wrath somewhat subsided, and from that time, notwithstanding the balminess of the air, Miss Mary might have been found near a fire, with numerous wrappings gracefully enveloping her person, reclined upon a couch. Her eyes were much affected by the illness which was of too gene- ral a nature for any particular appellation, and the ministers' services were languidly solicited, could he but find leisure to read for her consolation some of the good words she would fain hear. Walter complied several times with her request, but ended by sending Carrie in his stead; but from that time the dis- ease took a favorable turn, and ere long Miss Mary thankfully pronounced herself free from the danger, as yet not perceptible to others. As she slowly recovered, despair came overwhelm- ingly upon her, and desperate thoughts of leaving the village flasheld for a time athwart her mind; but the consoling reflec- tion, that no one would care if she did, deterred her, and with renewed strength and energy she took her accustomed place among the astonished natives. Poor Miss Mary! she was much to be pitied, yet few thought of her in connection with such a sentiment. Be the lonely who or what they may, theirs is a lot to awaken sym- pathy. She was generally regarded as one of the human evils sometimes inflicted on society, to be avoided if possible, for- getful that the yearning in every heart for something to love, or lean upon, is very different in its effects, as the mind has strength, or is nerved by the grace of the Holy Spirit. They forgot, in her outward unlovely seeming, to compassionate one on whom added years had left some trace, and riven her of all   224        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. who might have been dear, and by whom even she had been beloved! - Life is very, very desolate, all beautiful as may be its earth gifts, should the light of affection go out on its pathways. When our steps falter, and there are none to aid us, or when sickness with its palsying touch changes our strength to help- lessness, and no familiar voice speaks soothingly, no loved hand performs its kindly ofices. But oh, darker, sadder yet, is such a lot when the last step is to be taken, knowing that we must go, leaving no eyes to weep, no hearts to miss us. This is a dreary thought; and if such have not the pitying eye of love bent from on high upon their journeying; if the valley of death has for them no rod or staff to comfort, very sorrowful is their passing. Could we but remember all, as ever and anon we meet with spirits so differing from our own; could we but think of this, our eyes might look on them far more kindly, and our words grow gentle, for kind and gentle tones are the melodies of life, given unto each and all, and freely as they are given should they be bestowed. Life would be happier, the earth lovelier, and hearts far purer. For the time to come, when the days end not, might be laid up deeds of love, changing to stars of living brightness in the diadems of those who sought to follow the steps of the meek and lowly hearted!  i   CHAPTER XII.              ' "Oh, woman! lovely in thy beauty s power! Thrice lovely, whien we know that thou cans't turn To duty's path, and tread it with a smile!" "Obey ye ever God's behest, Elach and all some mission fill; Some the tempest born to breast, Some to worship and be still." "AT home once more, dear mother!" was the joyous greet- ing, as Rose Lawrence bounded to the arms ever ready to en- 'fold her: and, :'Lena, my sweet sister!" -was Carrie's welcome to the bright spirit-of joy with her sweet and winning words. They were very weary, those travellers, but they almost forgot to remember it in the glad meeting.   Dr. Lawrence re- turned with his sister, and Ignace Glanville was for a time his guest, or rather his mother's, for he contrived to spend a little more than half of his time at the parsonage; but there were no complaints, and it was very probable Ignace did not miss him.  Eulalie could not refuse to remain yet a little while with poor Carrie, who would be so very, very lonely, with no coming to look forward to when she was gone; but it must not be long, tor Gertrude was anxiously watching their coming to Glenwood, where nature was smiling her brightest welcome. So the young party resolved to improve. to the uttermost, ithp brief days lent them, and leave sorrow out of thought until it really came.   226        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. Long rides in the vicinity in the early morning, sent them back with eyes brightened by the exercise, cheeks flowing with health, and, what Lena called "alarming appetites!" Then those glorious nights, made them turn longing eyes to the blue water, and a fairy boat might have oft been seen skimming lightly over its clear depths in the still moonlight. Eulalie threatened and Walter expostulated; Mrs. Lawrence talked of colds and consequences; the young folks heard but heeded not, and the anxious matrons could only await their coming, patiently as might be, and forget to chide the truants on their return, in listening to their merry recitals. Oh, those were blissful hours!" a piece of a lifetime broken off too soon," Lena said, reproaching Eulie for such cruelty, wondering how she could have the heart; but then, to be sure, poor dear papa was waiting so patiently for them, it was right, after all, to go. And then she wove bright webs for the future time, and the rest listened and smiled-the young, hopeful as herself, and the elder forbearing to cast a shade upon their, joy by sweeping the fairy fabric from their thoughts. At last they parted-the sisters with clinging embraces, that refused to be severed, and mingling tears, and promises to write often, al- ways such long, long letters, and Carrie heard a farewell bless- ing, felt their tears upon her cheek, and was left to weep alone. It was long ere she could rouse herself from that listless, dreary feeling, which ever comes after excitement of grief or joy. It was very long, and Rose had knocked unheard for ad- mittance-her arms were about her neck, and her tears falling fast, ere Carrie knew that she was nepar. Rose had come to give and receive sympathy, for it was all so changed now at home; it was so still, she could not bear to sit where it had been so glad not many hours before. Sydney was gone too, and mamma seemed sad! it was a dreary place now. Carrie could give her but little comfort, for there was a weight upon her own heart she could not put aside. But still they sat almost silent in the little room, as though   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.       227 to look upon each other was yet a comfort. They sat there until the gathering shades called them to other duties, and they tried to meet Walter cheerfully; but his smile was very sad, and yet there was a light within his eye that told of holy communings. He called them to his side. and slightly alluding to their sadness, told how he had just turned from those with far deeper cause for tears, even while they might rejoice. He had been with the dying-he had left the bereft mourning for their dead-he had watched the last hours of the son and bro- ther, who had been gradually passing to a world of spirits, and on his prayer had gone up a soul to its reward. He had comn- forted, as best he might, those left almost desolate; but now, at their wonted hour of prayer, he knelt with them, asking of Him who ever hears to bind up the breaking hearts, to break not the bruised reeds. He thought of all; their loved and absent were not forgot- ten ; he besought that the Holy presence might go with them in all their journeyings, and a fervent though silent, Amen! answered from the young hearts near him. The prayer ended, they turned to those so deeply stricken, seeking in thought to aid them, and Walter heard their plans, and approved or suggested others; and when they went to rest it was with spirits blest with a consciousness of peace and good will toward all; and the thought of relieving'those who were in trouble, came like a healing balm, and their sleep was calm as though from the Father's throne, unseen, angels watched around them. A village funeral is a solemn thing! It is not the state or pomp of wo which strikes the deepest awe into the heart. The funeral train, in all its splendor-the waving plumes and proud steeds, curbed to measured pace, are but the semblance that a fellow-being mourns, and these alone would scarce awake a sigh. But, amid the simple homes of toil, where, as one united band, the joy or grief is shared by all, when from one dwelling goeth out a light, however dim, its beams are missed by many.   228        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. And thus it was when, from the widowed mother and unfortu- nate sister (to whom life was almost a weariness, where all things seemed to mock at her deformity) was taken the last frail reed on which they leaned, yet worth all the world to them, there were not wanting in their time of need offers of sympathy or aid from those who, like themselves, had oft been treading the same path, And when the morning dawned on their loneliness, Mrs. Lawrence was there to soothe and cheer; and Rose and Carrie sought the suffering sister, and wont her back to something even like hope. They read aloud the promises of the Comfort- er, who would never forsake them; and the widow looked up amid her tears, and blessed the rod that smote; and the fair girls learned, in that darkened abode, a lesson of faith and trust which was with them in long after years. And when the toils of the day were ended, the earth-wearied gathered about that quiet spot, in the little church-yard, to give back, " dust to dust," one who had grown up with them from childhood, shared their manhood's labors, and left them, in his death, a token of the rest to come,-and as the impres- sive burial rite was read, many a rough hand was drawn across eyes that were glistening even as wonman's. Carrie, too, turned, subdued from the spot; but in the morning went with Rose, to place, from their own garden, fra. grant blossoms to mark the spot and bring a soothing to the poor old mother's heart, that her darling should be thus re- membered. Life rolls on, clouds and sunshine, rainbows and darkness strangely intermingling. Death'comes, and bears with him to the place of graves, another and another trophy. The world pauses for a sigh or a tear, a few hearts still throb on sadly, and then the smile comes back again, and the melody of life drowns, in its triumphant burst, the wail of the stricken! Ignace Glanville found time for a brief visit to Geneva, ere he returned to his olden home, and very strangely did his l l   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        229 coming seem to many. But sweet Rose Lawrence did not seem to marvel, though her eyes looked with a questioning gaze, ever and anon,*towards her mother. He did not linger, but there was a bright tell-tale glance in his eye when he went to bid Carrie farewell, and she gave him her sincere wishes for his future weal; and with a return of her old playful moods, recalled him, as he turned away, with a wicked smile, asking "if he would like to have one of her curls, or if he had lost the other," for which malice he declared he would yet be avenged, and Lena would be sure to aid him. When Rose came in the evening, to her old friend, she found her ready to smile and rejoice with her; and in her joy to find her trust thus kindly welcomed, she talked on of the future, repeating her mother's cautious counsel, that they should be content to be separated now: "You know I am  so young yet; a mere child, as mamma says; and I will have so much to think of, so much to learn, lest Ignace should blush for his choice, if he took home to his mother such a little, idle butterfly." Carrie smiled fondly and reassured her, spoke of that mother, almost dreaded by the timid girl, as one formed to be loved, one who would cherish her so fondly; and as they thus spoke of her, Rose remembered her own fond parent's deep affection, and woldered how even Ahe ever could have won i her away; but Carrie soothed away her fears, and told how all would be well; and  Rose went back, with her happy hearts murmuring to herself, "Yes, Carrie is right; two years will soon pass, and for the rest, 'God will take care of us all;'" and this trustful, thought went with her, to add to the new joy circling about her path. It was very long before the rumor reached the quiet vil- lagers, but it went abroad at last, and poor Rose's cheeks were full often crimsgoned by allusions to her betrothal. Miss Mary discovered the mighty secret, and, full of as- tonishment, hastened to Carrie for its confirmation. She hoped, she said, poor Mrs. Lawrence would not have her head 10*   230        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. turned when that child was made a lady of. She did not ven- ture such a remark to Carrie; though others were edified by many similar. "A little pale-faced thing," she said, " with her hair always flying in the wind, and bonnet dangling on her arm, as though she had no head to put it on. She wondered what Mr. Glanville saw in all this so charming; though, poor child, she did pity her--for that mother of his would not put up with all her whims as Mrs. Lawrence did." Now and then such words came to Rose; but, though her lips would sometimes quiver, and the tear dim her eye, she would soon forget them; for they did not make her all they said, and she would learn to be all Ignace thought right. And then she would draw nearer to her mother's sheltering side, and ask her gentle counsel. with meek loving gaze bent so trustingly upon her; and the widow's heart would grow too full for utterance, as she drew her darling closer in her yearn- ing clasp, and pray that the shadows might be kept from that young face, and the vine might find a strong support for its wreathing tendrils when given to another f   CHAPTER XIII. "'Tis but a jest-no, no, it cannot be That I no more the blessed light may see!

MONTHS rolled on, summer faded, autumn changed to winter, whose chilling snows were not all that carried cold and suffer- ing unto hearts. In a far northern city, amid its brightest homles. one was strangely darkened. Every footfall within its chambers subdued to softness. From one the light was ex- cluded  and while the sunlight streamed gloriously elsewhere and many rejoiced in its brightness, its only gleam was from a shaded lamp, throwing a strange fitful glare on the watchers there. On a low couch lay one in pain, young, very young, a sufferer among strangers, far from his early hom e. Yet, Harry Selden was not forsaken  there were many  to cluster round hirnm; kind voices to whisper of a brighter time to come; and, even in that hour, while sleep yet held dominion over him, and his dreams were of his young heart's treasures, there watched and waited for his w  aking, the eyes that had bent over his   232        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. cradle sleep, and a mother's arms would soon enfold him, and her blessed tones bring music to his ear. Long and unweariedly she kept vigil, but not for worlds would she have resigned her privilege unto another; and Ed- ward took his place beside her, silent and calm, even as her- self, lest their murmurs should disturb his rest. 7 He woke at last! They knew it by the restless movement, and the eager call for his usual attendant. But the glance they sought, which had ever answered fondly to their own, was now sealed. The God who had given light to those full orbs by the touch of His finger, covered them as with a veil, shut- ting out the glad and lovely things of earth from his marred vision. And Gertrude was summoned to her child, to see him blind! as she bent above him; then the warm tears fell fast, and she could but murmur, "' God help us, oh my son!" "' Mother, darling mother, you unman me," he said, as he pressed her in his arms, " see," and he wiped the tears from his cheek that were mingling with her own. Edward Selden turned away, prayed for strength to submit to this sudden stroke, and nerved himself to be calm for his child's dear sake. Harry had been ill, even near to the grave's dark shadows. Suddenly had it come upon 'him, as with tempest might, the raging fever which laid him there in the midst of his strength, changed to the weakness of a child. The strong mind was prostrate, the mighty intellect weakened, and long and anxious- ly watched beside him those to whom he had grown dear, in watching with them, their sick and dying. Their home was left unto them desolate, for the young glad being who had brightened it passed away. None could tell upon what air that infectious breath was wafted to their dwelling blighting its fairest bud. The scarlet fever had for some weeks been prevalent in a distant part of the city, but dreaming danger afar, its tidings brought no fear. In an unexpected hour its shadow fell upon even them, and   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        233 little Annie Cameron, the only and the darling child, was numbered among its victims. To Harry Selden she had been fondly attached, and even in hours of delirium would wildly call his name. Harry watched beside her, with the stricken mother, until the last quivering breath was spent, and then gently closing the soft blue eyes, turned to the bereft, to min- ister the consolation poured into his own sad heart. From that hour he became to them a treasured memorial of their lost blossom, and when after the earth was laid between them and her blighted loveliness, he too bowed beneath the touch of that same disease, they kept their trembling vigil until those more dear to him were summoned. Strength and  consciousness gradually returned, but, oh, that desolating feeling that came over them, even then. The fever touch had vanished, the blood flowed calmly through the blue veins, but the eyes that would have looked in thankful- ness on those so fondly watching round him, opened vainly. They were curtained by the Invisible, and night, deep night, was over all. The strong man trembled as the quivering leaf beneath the storm, but no murmuring word escaped his lips, all silent was the spirit's wrestling with its shrine, yet seen by Him whose chastening hand was laid upon 1"His own."  Heard by Him was each supplication, and strength and submission were granted to that earnest prayer. Those who had heard his teachings while life yet wore for him its beauty, came in the hour of adversity to his sick chamber, to ind him enforcing those pure lessons of faith and trust, by the confidence and love which praised " for all that was past aid trusted for all that was yet to come, "Him who sendeth like the cloud and the sunlight. They came to the bedside f the young; they on whom years had left no trace, and those v'o bowed beneath their numbering, they went forth with isions of higher, holier gifts than earth bestows, of peace and ope coming only from the Father of life and glory. The cup of rejoicing had been proffered, and Harry Selden   234         BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. drank of its bright waters; a shadow deep and dark troubled its pure stream, but the same hand prepared them both, and he turned not rebelliously even from bitterness. Gertrude remained the guest of those who had so kindly cared for him, until they could remove him with safety. He refused at first to go from the scene of his first labors. His vision was obscured, but the lamp of the spirit burned more brightly upon the heart's altar. He would still go on, he said, to do the work assigned him. He could not look upon the faces grown familiar, or gaze with them upon the creations of their Father. but the tongue might yet speak of His love and goodness, and the ear was not sealed to the music of His praise. The memory of the past was around and about him, to shed an inner light, that blessed amid the darkness, and he could still tell unto his people the message of salvation, giving them tidings of joy and bliss unfading, eternal in the heavens. Gertrude pleaded long and earnestly, men of deep skill and,: learning were gathered around him, and he listened, at last to their persuasions. There were examinations, grave consulta- tions, and looks which Gertrude watched with changing fears and hopes, and then like a burst of joy came that cautious mes- sage, sweeping from her trusting heart all doubt or fear, leav- ing naught but joy and thankfulness. There was a hope, a slight hope, that the affliction would prove but for a season, but months of patient care alone could tell if this were vain. It was but a frail reed to lean upon, these thoughts of earthly beings; yet to her they seemed as pardon to the condemned, as the glad token of love and pity from Him who stayed the father's hand on Mount Moriah. Gertrude listened to their counsel, and urged Edward to heed each word, to plead with Harry that he would implicitly rely upon their judgment; and as she folded her arms about him tenderly as in his childhood had been her wont, pressing her lips upon those sealed orbs, something of her hopefulness stole   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        235 into his heart, and he thought how blessed 'twould be to look once more on her dear face. There was much to be thought of in those hours of watching, and memories which had only seemed to sleep, were awakened once again.  I He had not heard of Lizzie's marriage, or of the change come to her once joyous sister; but when Gertrude told how gentle she had grown, how much beloved, he would sigh and turn away or complain of weariness. But when a long letter came to Gertrude, calling forth tears, yet scarce of sadness, he listened eagerly to some of the hopeful words Carrie had penned there! Like a healing seemed the sympathy expressed for him, and a light in the night-time of his heart, the touching confession of her past unworthiness, pleading that Gertrude would pray for her, that she might evermore be kept from sinning. Harry wept not when the treasure, almost won, had passed from him-nor when the mandate of darkness came from on 'high-but those simple words addressed to another, bringing to him no message, scarcely blending with his name, unsealed the fountain of tears, the strong man wept! Gertrude fondly soothed him-added new hopes to his own bright dreams, and he felt that the thorns once gathered would be remembered no more, should flowers so cherished be per- mitted to bloom for him again. With new energy he went upon his darkened way, to seek the aid of one whose skill had sent a name abroad on earth, allied to goodness and to wisdormi, and into many a darkened home, hope, light, and rejoicing!   CHAPTER XIV. Come ye beloved to the homes that are lone, Missing your presence, our bright ones, our own! Come, for your glad voices sadly we pine! Come, in your gladness, to this olden shrine! Song-bird of summer, we listen for thee, Watching thy coming, with all that is free! THERE was a joyous welcome for the happy Lena, in her bright home!  Mrs. Leslie thought the time had never before seemed so long in their absence, though Ellerton assured them "that they need not feel flattered, for it was quite a pity they had returned, every one managed so well without them ;" and Lena proposed that he should be locked up, lest the sight of so many faces should affect too deeply. There was a heart beating more gladly as Ignace Glanville. neared the old roof which had sheltered his -childhood-a mo- ther's eye grew brighter when she gazed upon her son, and marked his glad and altered bearing; and when, in the dim twilight, they sat together alone; when she heard his heart revealings, listened to his eager hopes, she rejoiced in his new happiness, and assured him of the warm   and loving welcome awaiting her who had promised to share his home! and could Rose Lawrence have heard those earnest words of trust and love from the heart already yearning for her presence, she had    1 not feared to meet his mother's gaze.   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        237 *  *  *   *     *    *    *    g "Why, where have you been, Lena?" inquired Ellerton the next morning, as she came singing through the hall, her hands filled with flowers -" where have you been ? you remind me of some of the witches I used to read about !" and he held up his hands in comic amazement, and drew back, as though he actually feared her spell, but was repaid by the descent of those same flowers over his head, finding, in their fall, a lodg- ment in his hair and about his neck, " making him a garland," Lena said. " Now, papa," she exclaimed, cc you do look so very inter- esting, I am quite enchanted," and she twined her arms fondly about him, while he put back the clustering hair as he returned her caress. " 01 ! I have had such a ride," slhe continued " Starlight and I, and you can't think how glad he was to see me. I thought I would just go down and take a peep at him before breakfast, but he arched his neck so proudly, and seemed so impatient for a frolic, I could not resist the temptation, so away we went, over the fields so fast, and the wind played sad pranks with my hair, and sent my bandeau to keep the flowers company. I wanted to stop for it, but Starlight did not heed me, so on we went down.to the quarter, where I spied Uncle Eb at his door smoking his pipe, and waited to tell him to come up for his new fiddle, because you know we want to hear him try it. He looked so happy and called Margy out, and would not let me go until she brougllht me the flowers, and a sorry fate they have, all strewed on the ground," and she paused to gather them up again. "Very dignified behavior, I must say, Miss Lena Leslie," began Ellerton; ', I wonder what Dr.    ,' "Come dear papa, do let us go to breakfast," interrupted the young lady, " for I am very nearly hungry, and Eulie is waiting I know !" Very, very happy was Lenal in those days of careless free.   238        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.  dom, as joyous as the birds that winged their flight above her, as unconscious of all sorrow. Care and distrust had never left their dimness on her young life, and with so many to love, so few to chide her, what wonder that the days came and went as peacefully as the sunbeams Ithat told alike their dawning and their close! It is well to make home happy to the young, to throw around and about it a holy spell, that forbids the heart to wander and makes its memory ever blessed. Life has enough of care for after years; its teachings grow sad all too soon, and it is best to throw no shadow -on its bright morning! Guarded by affection, watched and cherished, Lena joyed on, happy in the happiness of others, reflecting back their smiles, or forgetting them only when a deeper shade of thought rested upon them. Dr. Lawrence had strangely yielded to the spell of her loveliness, and found a new image blending with that so long and fondly treasured. But he had yet to win the golden fa- vors so untiringly sought on earth. He had no home now worthy so bright a being, and he could not lure the song-bird reared 'neath summer suns to brave the winter-blast. She had never known a want--her every wish supplied almost un- spoken, circled in her luxurious hotre by all that was rare; and bright, and beautiful, he would leave the flower to bloom in its brightness until Fortune smiled upon him. So reasoned Syd- ney, in the first days of their companionship; but, as they journeyed on in that bright time together, reading loveliness from the same page of nature, joying in the same glad things, his proud resolves faded fast away, and ere they parted he had spoken to Eulalie the thoughts he had scarcely dared impart to Lena. There was no scorn in her answering tone, no repulsive word, causing the heart to shrink back within itself, malking worldly wealth the one thing to be coveted of all created good,-not thus would she mar a young heart's happiness,-   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        239 but her gentle counsel was heeded, and her hopeful woids for the future treasured for the time when he should no longer have theml from her lips to encourage and to guide hinml! Lena was often summoned by Mrs. Glanville, for she loved to have the young girl in her home, to listen to her wild, sweet lays, or answer fondly to her loving words. And now there was an added link binding her to her leart. She would ques- tion her of Rose, and listen gladly as the young enthusiast poured forth the hoarded memories of her friend. "Se wis so gentle, so good; Carrie loved her dearly, and indeed so do I;" she would invariably conclude, "but she is not the least like nme; she is gay too, but more quiet; I do not know how it is, only I am very sure you will help us all to love her." Mrs. Glanville did not doubt it. All ,who were dear to Ignace, were sure of a place in ter heart; and one gentle and loving, as they named Rose Lawrence, would find with her a happy home. She regretted that her mother so long delayed their happiness; yet could not selfishy urge the severing of that fond link so long her all! But many a long letter found its way to the merry maiden, to tell of thoughts which cherish- ed her, even then; many a costly token, memorial of those far away, yet ne'er forgetting her. It was little wonder then, that Rose mused in secret on the brightness of the path opening to her glad vision, or that the jests of the village brought little meaning to her car, hav- ing no power to reach the heart. Lena wrote to Rose in her rambling, happy strain, of what she knew would never tire her; of the mother, longing to wel- come her; of Ignace, who she declared was growing so disa- greeable there was no pleasure in his company-he put her in mind of a  flower without a stem, a body wanting a mind, for he looked without seeing, and listened without hearing, and, in- deed Rose had better send for him, nobody there would miss him she was sure; and then she would edify Ignace with its perusal, and in a postscript make comments on his remarks,   240        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. which proved more amusing than credible to the soft eyes that conned so long all that told of him. "Really, Lena, it is too absurd to write such nonsense," (Ignace would say,) " do you intend to be a child all your life?" And Lena would think of his words and study propriety, while Ellerton would be alarmed at the unwonted seriousness of his darling, but it would soon pass away; inspired by some new imagining, her lately acquired dignity would be forgotten, and Lena was herself again. "It was a consolation (she- often reflected) to think, if her childhood never ceased, she. would have papa for company-for indeed he was very nearly as wild as she was. " Eulalie often threatened to send Lena away to keep Eller- ton in some kind of order, appealing to Mrs. Leslie for advice; but their condemning words were soon ended by the caresses which met them, and Lena, at such times, would shake her head wilfully, declaring that "Papa and she knew how to manage them."

Many a heart was saddened even by her sorrow, for the gentle child had grown up   in the little village one of its most cherished  flowers, and  the mother who had so fondly guIded her timid steps, was very dear to all. So, when her place was left vacant, and she came in and out no more among them, because she had     been  called to tho Father's house on high, there were tears upon    earth shed for themselves and the motherless. "   242        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. Poor Rose! with a desolating weight had this grief fallen upon her heart. In the house of God, upon His holy day, she had knelt by that dear mother's side in prayer. She had heard her words of love, her teachings to the little children gathered there at the wonted hour, and never had they seemted more beautiful, more true. In -the morning, she had looked up to her for love and guidance, but ere the night-shadows fell, she was calling wildly that dear name; but the lips answered not; the throbbing heart was stilled, and the spirit gone to meet its God! Poor Rose! how Walter could have wept over her as he took her from the arms that seemed to shelter her even in death; how soothingly he spoke of the bright mansion of the soul freed from its earthly tenement. She heard him, but she heeded not. Words had no power to stay that first wild burst of agony, and he left her to Carrie's gentle care. All the long night, Rose watched beside her mother, as she lay in that last, deep sleep! All night she sat there with her arm thrown over that still form, her weary head pillowed on the cold breast; and when they sought to lure her away, she would cling the closer to the bier, and gazing wildly on the cold pale  face, weep anew and plead that she might remain. None could withstand that anguished supplication. When the morning dawned, she was there still; and when they bore from the home she had so blest, its dearest light, Rose promised to be calm if they would but let her follow her to that last resting- place! She was calm, as they bore her gently to the place where, in life, she had stood with other mourners. She was very calm, when the voices of the village children sent up a triumphant strain to the clear heavens, the soul's rejoicing to be free! She was calm through it all; but when they lowered the coffin to its deep, dark resting-place, and threw the cold, damp earth upon that cherished form, shutting out all that remained of her from her fair child's gaze for ever, a cry of agony thrilled   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         243 the hearts of all around, and Rose Lawrence was carried in- sensible from her mother's grave! Sydney had been summoned, but from some unavoidable delay, came but in time to enter the lonely dwelling whence she had just been carried forth; came to receive the drooping flower-to fold unto his stricken heart the motherless! He watched unweariedly over her, in the hours of suffering that followed, soothed and comforted her, and, like a ministering angel, Carrie Duncan came to aid him in his vigil, and in that dark time Miss Mary Dalrymple proved a kind efficient friend, ever beside poor Rose, untiring and unfaltering in her care. They nursed her back to health, and Carrie took her to the parsonage, when Sydney was compelled to leave them; but it was very long ere the memory of those fearful hours, even for a brief time, forsook her; and when some memorial of the treasure she had lost would suddenly meet her gaze, her grief was almost wild. Nor, for long months, did she seek again the lonely mound where they had lain her, but, in the still evening she would gaze in silence on the far-off sky, for she said she could not think of her darling mother as shrined be- neath the flowers, where footsteps came and went--she loved to imagine her blest honme far, far above them! But as time passed on, the words of sympathy and conso- lation, coming ever and anon from the far-off friends, brought their soothing; and when Carrie read Lena's messages and plans for the time when she should be with them, she did not shake her head so sadly, or turn tearfully away, as she had done at first. And when Lizzie came for a brief time to her old home, Rose seemed more cheerful, and was won sometimes from her solitude to join them amid their early haunts. Lizzie's stay was brief, but, ere she left, she won Walter's consent to part for a time with his young charges. They would be sure to like her quiet little home, and Charles so longed to bid them welcome there. It was not very far from the city,   244        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. yet far enough to escape its busy thronging crowd, and a plea. sant ride would give them a glimpse of its towering domes. Capt. Walton's duties called himt there daily, but he preferred his morning pilgrimage, as he called it, to residing at the station. So they went away well plied with counsels of prudence by Miss Mary, who would have given directions for every day in the week, had they but listened, and Carrie's mirth seemfled iln- fectious as she turned for another lingering gaze at the white  walls of the dear old house, and saw Miss Mary bending for- ward. with warning finger raised and lips still moving, though the trees and birds were her only audience. Charles Walton gave them a glad greeting, hoping that now they had been lured from Geneva they might find charms enough elsewhere to detain them long from its " classic shore." There were pleasant neighbors near, and though on account of Rose they mingled but little in society, they found in these much to admire, for the sweet and pensive face of Rose had left an impress on the kindly hearts, winning for her sympathy { and love. There were those who would have bowed in homage to the  , rare loveliness of Carrie, but neither smile or look responded to the effort to win more than the mere common courtesies of life from the "' proud, cold beauty," as she was not unfrequellt- i ly called. Only one-of the devoted knights remained ill the lists sole competitor, vainly imagining himlself the victor. With  the return of each evening did Henry Loyd, Esq., present  ; himself at Capt. Walton's, very much to the amLusement of that gentleman, and the annoyance of poor Carrie, who vainly tried to avoid the unwelcome intruder. He sent her books wlwich, being invariably returned, he concluded she was not literary, i (a fact which he did not in the least regret); he filled hler vases with choice flowers, which she never seemed to see. blt still he did not despair. He could wait for encouragement, not- withstanding a snowy streak here and there. amid his oice i raven locks, told that time was doing his work slowly but surely   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.         245 He gave an entertainment to which all the country round were invited, but at which none of Capt.

His house was then thrown open for their reception only, and the stately host waited to welcome them to partake of his lhos- pitality; but Carrie came not, and Lizzie was too much amused at his evident annoyance to offer an excuse for her absence. Still, nothing seemed to daunt his courage or diminish the ardor of his affection.  Day after day he came, like a moving automaton, at the same hour-ensconced himself in the same high chair-remained exactly the same length of time, and, with a bow of changeless solemnity, regularly departed. "Well, Carrie," Rose would say, " there is no resisting fate. Esquire Henry will never give you up, so you may as well submit!" But Carrie thought otherwise, and wyisled, that his atten- tions could be transferred, threatening to send him with letters of itntroduction to Miss Mary Dalrymple, which idea carried out, Capt. Walton thought would be charitable. Arid there was a merry sparkle in his eye, and he overheard that gentle- nian, previous to thlcir departure, announce his determination of visiting Geneva during the summer. Carrie thought such all event would be distressing indeed, but she did not reply to his remark, though her face expressed any thing but satisfaction. Capt. Walton returned with them to New-York, leaving them with Lucy Emllerson, at her request, until Walter could conime to seek them. It seemed soothing to Rose to be so near her brother-th e only one whose protection she had a right to claim, and nearer than of yore were the hearts of these two bound in their bereavement. and long and earnest were their cornlrunings of her who had left them lonely, but whose influ- ence had still lingered, seeming a holy presence ever near.

The friends I once condemned are now Affectionate and true; I wept a false one's broken vow, But she proves faithful too I And now there is a happiness In every thing I see, Which bids my soul rise up and bless The God who blesses me!" SPRING had come with its soft breath, whispering of green fields far away; singing birds had returned, and summer buds were peeping forth joyously from the bright leaves amid which they nestled, and still were the flowrets of Geneva gladdening with their presence Lucy's dwelling. Walter had not yet sum- moned them, and they gladly lingered. With the bright messengers of summer had come those long loved, long thought of. Very unexpected, even to her sister, was Gertrude's return, and anxiously had they waited for tidings from the dear sufferer. But weeks passed, and naught was heard.; fear came in hope's stead, and tremblingly they watched for what must bring joy' or sorrow.   248        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. Like a vision of past years, a spirit long since gone; seemed the sudden presence of Harry Selden in their midst, in the fair summer's morning, and tears and smiles were strangely blended, as they fondly gathered around the longe absent; and Gertrude's heart was too full for utterance when she brought back her child restored once more to light and joy. Great was the rejoicing in that group of home friends, and as the glad ti- dings went abroad, one after another came to share in the hap- piness so newly given. There was joy and gratitude in that home, and yet to one heart in its midst it came with overwhelm- ing power, and Carrie Duncan sought the solitude of her cham- ber to muse unchecked upon it all. There was thankfulness which words could scarce express, ever trembling upon her lips, and blissful thoughts flitting through her mind, sending a joy- ous light to the dark eyes and smiles that told of happiness. Lying she lingered, until those below began to wonder at her absence, and a mournful fear was stealing into one heart, lest the eyes so long sealed to those beloved should now look upon the dearest of them all, to find hope had again deceived. But as the hours wore on they sent Rose to seek her, and she came looking so lovely in her snowy dress, the soft rose-hue mantling in her cheeks, and the brightness of old time beaming from her eyes, that the gaze of all turned fondly to her, and Gertrude gave her a seat beside her, questioned her of Lizzie, of Walter, and Lena, all dear to both. After a time Harry drew near and joined in the converse, and then Carrie noticed for the first time how changed he was, and sorrowed for the suffering which had wrought it all. It had been their intention to hasten to Glenwood, whither Edward had preceded them, but Lucy urged them to remain, if but for a few days, and Harry required little persuasion, for the olden spell was still upon him, and he could not turn with- out regret from one long since resigned, and yet still dear. Very swiftly passed those days away, for in their brief, bright hours there had been thoughts of other years recalled,   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        249 their memories dwelt upon, and the vows once broken breathed again with new faith, and trust that might not falter. And Harry Selden thought that God had been kind and merciful to himn, above all others, and he prayed that the heart so leaning on His strength in its grief, might ne'er forget him in its joy. Tremblingly had Carrie promised to be all to him that she had once so sadly failed to be, and when Gertrude knew of it she blessed them fervently, committing them fondly to His care who had heretofore watched and guarded them. The joy of one was extended to all, and the hopes brightening for those young Lried hearts were shared by each. Mr. Emlmerson spoke cordially and kindly, wishing that the future might have many a bright hour to bless them. Lucy smiled and whispered gentle words to the fair girl, while Rose kissed and blessed lier, weeping amid it all that she who would have joyed like them was no longer near. Carrie turned from her own happy musings to soothe her, to murmur softly of spirits gone that look upon and love us still, with a dearer. purer love, and as she spoke of heaven with its unseen glories, the glistening eyes grew bright amid their tears, the bowed head was raised, and Rose resolved to check all saddening thoughts, nor mar with her deep sorrow the glad- ness of others. Walter came atlast to learn that he must give up the child of his care to the keeping of another. But lie did not speak his thoughts when Harry sought hiln. He had lived for others, and his own wishes were never allowed a voice where the hI p- pincess of those hc loved was concerned. He gave her to his cal;e, as the only earthly gem now left him, the one bright 'larlll of his lonely home, and he spoke of her as one who would sh}1are his every joy or care, making the one more glad, sooth- ing away the other He bade him watch over her fondly as ihe ilad. done ; to shield her froml care ; to guide her thoughts ever to the Great Being who had given her to their love. Harry   250        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. promised all, and went joyously from his presence with his blessing. A shade would have dimmed that joy, could he have seen Walter left alone there, save in the presence of his Maker. The memory of the long, long past, came with its subduing pow- er, and tears from eyes that seemed ever glancing heavenward, fell thick and fast, unconsciously, as those records were re-read. Those who had been around him in his boyhood were with him no longer; the brother of his youth, the father who had guided, the mother who so loved him--all, all gone. The play- mate of his earlier years, the friend of his manhood, fled from his sight. The bright star which for a time had beamed upon his path, too early set. The beautiful and best beloved he had seen fade away, even while he watched and prayed; and now, she who came in her childish loveliness to win another cherished place in his stricken heart, she too must leave him, and again he would be left alone, alone! But not for long, oh, not for long; and the fainting spirit girded on anew the strength of Him who hath a healing for each wound, and Walter roused himself to speed on again with hope undimmed by earth-care to the end of his brief pilgrimage, when he should hear the Father saying, "Well done," bidding him enter into rest. When the years of his life's journeying should vanish as a span and be forgotten in the endless joy of heaven, where the early lost should greet him, and a new song should be given him with them to sing--the song of praise and rejoicing for ever- more. "How delightful!" was Sydney's pleased greeting, as he came to spend with them the last evening of their stay; "Quite like old times!" and he seated himself by Rose, ex- pressing at the same time his regret to part with her. "But I suppose," he said, with an arch glance that made her turn away, "L I suppose I may as well accustom myself to her ab- sence," and he gave her a letter he had that morning received   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.       251 from Ignace, which was kept for the time when it might be perused unnoted. There were many plans formed in that hour for the future, and many a pleading glance that would not brook delay, and it was finally settled that they should next assemble at Glen- wood, and hope wreathed bright garments for its coming, and fairy imaginings flitted to a far-off home, and Sydney Law- rence dreamed the brightest dream his waking hours had ever known. And though the little group parted on the morrow, and went upon their varied paths, one common hope was jour- neying with them, one sweet memory followed all! "Such follies! what was to come next?" was Miss Mary's pious ejaculation, with hands held in higher amazement than ever, and eyes lifted expressively towards ,the ceiling! "To think," she said, "that as soon as Harry Selden got his sight he should begin to think of marrying! and to think that, after all, he and Sydney Lawrence were going to be brothers, and poor little Rose was going to do better than the beauty, after all!" Such was her revelation to Henry Loyd, Esq., during his promised visit to'Geneva, and there must have been stranger revealings, and sympathetic confessions, for, in a few days Miss Dalrymple and Mr. Loyd were both missing, creating by their disappearance quite an excitement in the village, but which soon died away. Thei, mystery was solved when Lizzie wrote an account of her visit to the bride, Mrs. Henry Loyd, in whom, though loaded with jewelry, she recognized the late Miss Dalrymple! "Poor old Miss Mary," said Sydney, when he heard it, H' so she ran away from the parson, after all!" l X   CHAPTER XVII. There were gatherings and bridals, There were blending, smiles with tears, Joyous meetings, and sad partings, Farewells breathed perchance for years. There were olden mem'ries mingling With the hopes of time to come, There were hearts all filled with gladness, And some left all alone I A YEAR sped on, with little change to those .who watched its flitting. Summer was come again to glad the hearts of some, leaving others more doubly lone! Glenwood was thrown open for the reception of those who had been wont to meet there long ago! Busy preparations foretold some uncommon event. Carriage after carriage whirled rapidly through the neigh- boring village, and its inhabitants watched those who came and went, as though each glance would unveil to them the se- cret of this unwonted excitement. Lucy Emmerson came alone, but that was scarcely noted, for she was wont to visit her sister in the summer months. Eulalie and Ellerton followed with Lena, and then the curious talked and wondered, until the arrival of Mr. Duncan, with Carrie, Rose Lawrence, and a lady whom they had never seen, afforded them an added theme.  But when, some days after,   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        253 Mr. Emmerson followed with a foreign-looking youth, their amazement Was at its height. Then, last of .all, came Charles Walton and Lizzie, and some of the old people who had loved her when a child crowded around the carriage to look at her once more, "God bless her;" and the tiny treasure she had brought with her received a tribute of admiration grateful to the mother's heart. It was a strange meeting, and to none did it seem more so than to those thus assembled. But Harry was going away, and Gertrude would not have it otherwise. ' A very novel method," Lena said, and wondered what people would say! ' She should not be surprised if it was rumored that the old folks had plotted in their wicked hearts to bring them there to be secretly dispatched. She only hoped she might be allowed a choice as to the means," and she looked so irresistibly winning that Ellerton's reproof was speedily checked. It was a strange gathering, and yet very solemn seemed it to Rose Lawrence and Carrie Duncan, this forming of new ties for a lifetime. No light thing was it unto them, but the merry Lena appeared to regard it as something very neow and grand, yet withal so amusing, she could not but express her wild, strange thoughts. It would have been very sad without her; but it seemed scarcely right that she should thus care- lessly and thoughtlessly assume such solemn duties. There was some thought of deferring her marriage, " she was so child- ish," pleaded Eulie,% "she really feared it was wrong to allow it." But Sydney would not listen, and seemed so pained, that Walter was consulted, and he thought it was better not to part them now. Lena's youth was a fault which would grow daily less, and he had a long talk with the merry maiden, and when it was over smoothed her hair fondly, and told her to fold her little hands quietly, and learn to be dignified like the other young brides elect. Lena tried it for nearly a whole day, but she found it very "   254        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. tiresome; and when they were assembled in the evening, hold- ing grave consultation as to the naming of little Miss Walton, she caught the darling from its mother's arms, and, dancing away with it, told them, " she could give the bright pet some- thing to answer to; she should always call it May ;" and May it was, and Walter pronounced the words -that dedicated by this sweet appellation another life to the Creator. There was hurrying to and fro at the Villa, lights glancing here and there. and within its chambers the hum of voices, now subdued to softness, now thrilling joyously, as though the spirit of mirth had winged its way to some young heart. A scene long to be remembered, a group never to be for- gotten, were met in Gertrude's room that evening. Three fair girls, so lovely, yet so unlike, were listening to her gentle words. Carrie Duncan in her bridal robe, with her high and noble bearing, and a light in her speaking eye telling of proud re- solve and holy trust, was- treasuring the words of one to whom she would, ere long, be a daughter; and Rose Lawrence, with, an arm twined fondly around her, (as though she would still cling to her for sympathy and support.) her soft eyes bent upon the ground, and the crimson flitting ever and anon to cheek and brow, listened eagerly to that same counsel. But L'ena,  the merry Lena, trying to be so grave with the smile that zvould come, wreathing her bright lips and the joyous glance, now resting on the tiny foot in its snowy slipper, playing bo-peep with the fringed cushion at grandmama Leslie's feet, then raised saucily to Eulie. who looked proudly, yet tearfully, upon her darling-did she heed those gentle teachings? Gertrude kissed them fondly, circling the arm of each with a parting gift. Carrie's bracelet was wrought of her hair, and in the medallion that clasped it, Edward's miniature with her own, those who would henceforth teach her to recall the fond appellation she had been wont to give those gone to God! Those of Lena and Rose, were formed of cameos; and   BUtDS AND BLOSSOMS.        255 with childish pleasure Lena turned it again and again, press- ing her lips to the fair features so exquisitely traced there. But they must tarry no longer, the impatient summons had been twice repeated, and they mustj join the others. Poor little Lena! her heart throbbed wildly then; she forgot her smiles and jests, drew closer to Eulalie, and laid her hand be- seechingly in hers. That warm, fond clasp seemed to reassure her; but when Carrie's vows were spoken, and Ignace had led Rose forward when it was her turn to stand before Walter, who spoke so solemnly, she forgot all her threatened mischief, and trembled sadly as she stood by Sydney, drawing closer the floating veil, that seemed a, silvery cloud, between her sweet face and the eyes that gazed on it. She was timid then, and when it was quite over, received their kindly wishes with a downcast eye and blushing cheek. But when Ellerton pressed her to his heart and blessed her, and then, to hide his agitation, playfully called her by her new name, her musical laugh found its way to every heart, and she was not alone in her joyous- ness. '"She could not help it, indeed," she said, in answer to Sydney's look of surprise, "' it seemed so strange to be called ' Mrs.' like grandma, and Eulie, and the rest of them." Ellerton condoled with Sydney, and told him he was afraid he would have to give her back to them yet, as a bad bargain; but when Sydney told him how nicely he would school her, she only grew the merrier, but went away after a time to sit with Eulie. There were many saddening thoughts called up by those three bridals. Walter looked on Carrie, sighing for the time when he must return to his home alone. In the heart of Rose, mingling with her joy, were memories of the dear mother who had looked forward to this hour; and Mrs. Glanville must have read the changes flitting o'er her face, for she pressed her lips fondly to the fair cheek, murmur- ing, "Ours, now; all our own."   256        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. Gertrude marked the happy light in Harry's eye, and the glad music of his voice, as he bent above the treasure won at last, and thought how very hard it was to give them up. A few short weeks, and perchance she might look her last upon them; for Harry was going far from his native land to bear unto those who had never heard a Saviour's name, the tidings of salvation. This had long since been his resolve, and Carrie would never shrink from aught he deemed a duty. Her place was by his side, and there would she ever strive to be fulfilling with him each high and holy mission. But Lena, who could think of aught but birds, or flowers, the bright and happy things of earth, when meeting her sunny glance? Not Ellerton Leslie, surely; he was by her side as though he had not just given her to another, forgetful that another's claim upon his darling could be greater than his own. He urged Sydney to change his plans, to come with them to their southern home, where he would engage to find him patients enough to keep him employed; and he feared, too, that -the northern winters would prove too chilling for the child; but Sydney did not seem to apprehend such danger, and Lena proposed that Papa and Eulie should come to them, and see what a nice house- keeper she was going to make. Ellerton laughed at the very idea of associating her with thoughts of housekeeping, and drew such an amusing picture of a very little lady, with a huge bunch of keys, as the insignia of office, that she could not prevent the laugh for which she had meant to substitute a frown. Mrs. Glanville and Ignace were obliged to return earlier than they had anticipated, but Ellerton and Eulalie would not hasten to the home which, having held Lena so long, would be too dreary when she was not there. So Rose went from them, bearing with her the heart's kindest wishes, leaving naught dearer now than those who claimed her as theirs. Yet it was sad to part with Carrie. She had ever been a friend, a dear companion; but -she, too, had formed other ties, and they   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.       257 could never be the same again that once they were. It seemed strange, passing strange, that a few solemn words should change the timid girl to the thoughtful woman. "So strange," Lena said, 'that one little week ago, she might fly here and there as she listed, and laugh or sing, as the mood prompted; but now, because Uncle Walter put on a grave face, and gave her a ring and a blessing, she must keep quiet all the rest of her life, 'and remember that she was married now,' she was sure she had much rather forget it;" and she very nearly contrived to do so, for no one heard her talk any the less, and Ellerton said, " that she and May made noise enough to alarm the vil- lage."' She was merry enough then, but when the time came to go, she wept and sobbed in Eulie's arms, and clung to her as though all joy had departed, begging to go with them; but Sydney placed her in the carriage, grasped each parting hand, and then their brightest flower was gone! A sadder parting was yet in store; very bitter were the tears poor Gertrude shed, when with her husband and Lucy they looked upon the vessel bound for a far-off land. They went with Harry, and lingered on board until they could no longer stay; but ere the last word of departure was spoken, Walter knelt in the cabin with them, and prayed that God would not forsake their loved ones, but guide them safely o'er the deep, and in His own good time give them back again. There were bitter tears shed then, and Gertrude's eyes grew dim as from the shore she watched the snowy sails that were fast winging her children from her sight. Very sadly they turned back again to take their accustomed places, to walk, on through paths riven of their flowers, and very fervent were the prayers that went up to the Father's throne to walk therein aright I e S    CHAPTER XVIII. Mem'ry grows dim, there is not much Of joy, or grief, to tell, The stars are fading, one by one, From where they used to dwell. But life has still enough of hope To point us unto heaven, Where tears are wiped away, and hearts Shall never more be riv'n, TIME sped on! Three years had fled since that meeting and that parting. Again a watching group had met at Glenwood, for those long severed were hoping to meet again! "' Eulie," had Mrs. Lawrence written. to one in her olden home, ' darling Eulie, you must come and take me back to the dear old place again. I am very sure you are tired of missing me, and Sydney says I am just as bad as ever (not that he really thinks me so wicked)" and he supposes I must go, so he will make arrangements to follow. The truth is he is quite as willing to come as I, but makes Lena the excuse; but I alm so glad to win his consent at last, I do not mind the cause. So do come, you and papa; only I will not promise to be on good behavior if he does ; but bring him with you-he laughed at my housekeeping, and I would just like him to see me here   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.       259 at home-even Sydney is proud of my skill. I have the tidiest of little maidens to come at my bidding, quite a picture, only she has such a habit of commencing every sentence with a , ' Please ma-am,' and it sounds strangely to me, even yet. "Be sure to come, for Harry is bringing back our darling Carrie. She grew ill in that heathenish country he took her to, and no wonder; how could she endure all their unchristian ways? but she is never to go back, Gertrude says, and I, for one, shall be so happy! "Tell Rose I can hardly believe the half of the fine his- tories she writes me, but I am coming to see for myself. Sydney came in while I wrote, and says we are all to meet at the villa. I suppose it will be more agreeable, only papa will net see me in my own house, but he must try to imagine me!" Carrie came to her native land again changed and droop- ing. The burning sun of the sultry clime to which she had gone seemed all too vivid in its beams for the cherished flower, and tenderly Harry bore back to a more genial clime the treasure he so fondly watched. Sadly changed Lena thought her when she arrived at Glen- wood, but the invalid seemed cheerful by her unclouded happi- ness; and when after a time Ellerton and Eulie joined them, tenderly cared for by each and all, she regained strength and vigor, and Walter too was there to look upon his child, and bless the father who had brought her safely to their arms. Walter was growing feeble, and was forced to yield his place in the village to another, to give to another's care the people to whom he could minister no longer, and gladly listened to the proposition, that he should share a charge with Ha rry, thus yielding his influence and guiding counsel, and Carrie joyed to think that as age came upon him heavily she might still be near, to minister to his wants. Thus it was arranged, and Ed- ward Selden and Gertrude resolved to dwell where those who   260        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. were their all were about to make for themselves a new home. Glenwood in all its beauty passed into other hands, and other hearts there learned the lessons of life; other voices mingled their glad tones where once childish glee rung out in the clear air. There was a triumphant cheering met the. startled ear as Lena neared her home again, and above it all came the merry tones of a violin, and Lena's: heart beat gladly as she recog- nized those gathered to welcome her, with "Uncle Eb" at their head, armed with "Miss Lena's fiddle" as he always call- ed it. Lena stopped the carriage and returned their hearty greet- ings so kindly, " jest like hersef," Eb said. The piazza reached, Rose and she were soon clasped in each other's arms, and Mrs. Leslie's feeble voice called the dear children to hasten. and she folded the long absent to her heart, and said " the bright face made her dim old eyes grow clearer." Mrs. Glanville and Ig- nace were not far off, and as Lena seated herself in the centre of the circle that evening, " she declared she would be quite happy if Sydney were only there, poor fellow, he must be lonely, but he would not be long in following her, she knew; a predic- tion soon after verified. "She talked to each and all at once; she had so much to tell. so much to ask, the words did not speak half as fast as her thoughts." In a fair town on the banks of the blue Hudson, Harry Selden gathered near him those best beloved, and 'Carrie marked Walter in hours of ease taking her husband's place, teaching unto those who hung upon his words the same truths she had heard in other days in the village church of Geneva. He went about as ever, striving to do good, though his steps were feeble, and the little children often checked their noisy plays, and suiting their pace to his measured tread that the good old  ,    .   .   BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.        261 minister might talk to them, walked beside him as he went to and fro. Mr. and Mrs. Loyd lived in their grand house to the envy of some, and the amusement of others, and when, occasionally, rumors of Walter's goodness or of his failing strength would reach them, she was wont to sigh, or remark--" poor old man! she used to know him; but people must expect to be infirm when they lived to such an age!" Mr. and Mrs. Emmerson were frequently the guests of Harry, dividing their time between them and Gertrude, and the fruits of Lucy's riper years proved that the lessons of her youth had not been given in vain. In her, as in Gertrude and her child, were exemplified the truth of olden maxims. As the first budding was tenderly watched, carefully trained, so had its blossoming repaid all toil, in brighter and maturer beauty. As the flowers were nurtured in the garden of earth, so when they had bloomed and withered here, would they win new and glorious loveliness among the blossoms that die not, in the New Jerusalem! The fire hath gone out on my lonely hearth; its last em- bers faded as I watched!  Without, the darkness reigns, and the snow lieth heavily on the earth, even as those sorrows which have fallen on my heart and blanched my hair to whiteness I The loved of my youth are gone in the far-off land, or in earthly homes brighter than mine own, they know not of my desolation.  Their voices come around me, echoing from the- past in the still deep night; and I turn to clasp them, but the shadows mock me! Here are the bright tresses which I severed, and from their jewelled cases look forth the joyous semblances of those miss- ing from my side! My fairy darlings! ye who made sunlight in earth's darkest paths, why have ye fled from my idolizing love?  My noble May! my little Rose! where are your youllg heads pillowed? Alas! curtained by the night-cradled in   262        BUDS AND BLOSSOMS. the storm, beneath the cold damp earth! and I, who yearn to shelter you am left alone; no, not alone! God is still with me; and he to whom in girlhood I gave my trusting faith. is left me still! May our Father forgive the weakness of a mother's stricken heart! May He help me to remember ever, that my treasures are safely housed, where no chill wind can reach theml. --where sorrow shall never find them, and where, in the day of his coming, the glorified' spirits shall be joined again unto the earthly part, now slumbering! I will hush my sighs, and oh! what need of tears has one who has added two bright an- gels to the choir that swell the anthems of triumph near the throne! I will lay me down to rest, trusting to Him who doeth what is right, and who, ere long, will give us one bright home together! And if, perchance, when Lizzie Walters sleeps with .hose who have gone before, the memories she traced shall meet some other glance and leave a holier spell of thought on some young heart. the blessing of Him "who hath loved us," will have rested on her labors i May His spirit guide them intr life's journeying, and when, at last, their eyes shall be closed to earth's scenes, may His presence bear them mid the angels to His holy home, where sin hath not entered-" where there is one fold and one Shephlerd," and our Redeemer is the light!
