IF there be one truth, more strongly enforced than any other by the history of England for the last three centuries, it is the folly of attempting to crush the Catholic religion by the sword of persecution. Wise, indeed, was the saying of Gamaliel the Pharisee, to those who would have punished St. Peter and the Apostles for preaching the Church of Christ, "If this council or this work be of men, ifwill come to nought: But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it." Through what dangers, what persecutions has not the Catholic Church passed unharmed? The Roman Empire threw itself with its gigantic power against it: but the blood of the Martyrs was the seed of Christians. And after three centuries of fearful persecution, the despised emblem of the cross shone, resplendent with jewels, upon the Imperial Crown of Constantine, and from the silken folds of the Labarum, floated over his victorious Legions; while throughout the mighty city, thence forth destined to be the seat and centre of Christianity, that same glorious emblem rose above the countless temples of false gods, which had been purified and consecrated to the worship of'the one true God. , The History of the Church, from that day, has been but a succession of dangers and persecutions, followed in each instance by increased energy,. and renewed success. The   vi       INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER         - fires which her enemies have heaped up around her, have only purified her, and she has always come forth like gold refined by the furnace, brighter and more glorious. She has stood the test of Gamaliel for near two thousand years, and she has not -been overthrown. She has not been overthrown, but she has gone oh increasing in efficiency, 1 and spiritual energy, and spreading her missions and her teachings to every quarter of the world: and the number of her children is greater now- than it has been at any former period. "If it be of God, you cannot overthrow , it-lest perhaps you be found even to fight against God."*  History has verified these words. The commencement of the reformation in England, its  ; history,' and the causes that produced it, are too well known to be repeated here. It is an old story, it is long, and there are few who have not read it well. The tyranny r of Henry the Eighth was only aimed at the supremacy of the Pope, who had refused to sanction his divorce from the wife of his youth, when disgusted with her fading beauty, his wandering eye had fixed upon the lovely form of an ambitious lady of the court. He punished with death those. who admitted the spiritual supremacy of the Pope, and those who denied the other doctrines of the Catholic Church., Upon his death, the power of the crown passed into the hands of the reformers, and in the name of Edward the Sixth, severe laws were passed against the Catholics, which, executed by Mary in a few instances upon those who had aided to frame them, won for her the name of "Bloody," while Edward and Elizabeth, who made the land red with Catholic blood, received the titles of" sainted ' and "good." Such is the justice of Protestant historians. The laws which were put in force against Catholics and Act. v, *9. II   INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.       vii dissenters, would have added to the reputation of a Nero or a Caligula, and were only erased from the statute book which they disgraced long after they had been rendered inoperative by the controlling power of public opinion. Yet in their day, executed by bigots or by designing men, they formed perhaps the most terrible and effective system that was ever adopted to crush out a national faith or feel- ing from the hearts of a people. It is not strange, therefore, that in the course of a few generations, the proscribed and persecuted Catholics di- minished in number, although the faith of the few, and the zeal of their pastors, never drooped nor faltered. In the northern counties, in particular, and throughout the retired districts, the pure faith of their fathers was preserved by the children in spite of fines, and penalties, and death. In the old English Manor house, the farm house, and the humble dwelling of the cotter and day-laborer, the per- secuted and hunted priest found food, and rest, and refuge. By day he lay concealed wheresoever a kind Providence afforded him shelter, and by night he went forth upon his duty of love, girt like a pilgrim with his staff in his hands, traversing on foot the weary paths and by-ways that con- nected the solitary dwellings of his scattered flock. The exercise of his priestly functions, nay, his very pre- sence in England, rendered him liable to banishment or death; and the same bloody guerdon awaited those who dared to give him shelter and comfort. Yet, never were there wanting laborers in this fearfill vineyard, and never did the fire of the true faith go out in the darkest days of f persecution. No sooner did one holy priest expire upon the scaffold or in the dungeon, a martyr to his religion, than others, as devoted, landed on the shores df England to supply his place, to cheer his saddened and drooping   viii     INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER. flock, to tread in his footsteps, and to die perhaps like him upon the scaffold. Thus, when the light of faith had been extinguished upon- the cathedral altar, and in the stately minster and gorgeous chapel, it was rekindled with brighter and purer flame in the lowly and secludtled dwellings of the scattered faithful. Thus, too, did it happen, that in spite of the severest penalties and the most constant persecu- tions, many Catholic families were still to be found in that scourged land at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Yet it was always necessary for the Catholics, even in those periods of repose, when the laws against them were permitted for a time to slumber, to act with great- circum- spection and to conceal their compliance with the requisi- tions of their faith. Even when it seived no purpose of the government or of parties, to excite against them the preju- dices of the people and to enforce the full power of the penal laws, there were alwajs upon the watch artful and unscru- pulous men, who were ready to seize upon- those laws to turn them to their oven emolument. And a still lower class, the mere informers, were prompt to detect the signs- and tokens of the proscribed faith, for they fattened on the ruin of their victims. Those gentlemen, therefore, who still adhered to the old church, felt that it was their interest to live secluded and maintain as little intercourse with their neighbors as was consistent with prudence; for too great a degree of retire- ment might have tended to excite the very suspicion and enquiry which they desired to avoid. By adopting this course, some of the least prominent Catholics-were for a considerable period enabled to escape the fines and penalties which were the usual fate of the bolder, less prudent, or, perhaps, wealthier and ,pore prom- inent of. their brethren. Others, again, were protected by   INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.       ix the influence of powerful friends from the persecution which generally awaited those who remained firm in the practice of their faith. There were many instances of de- voted zeal and cordial and hearty assistance, on the part of -Protestant gentlemen, toWards their Catholic relatives, and to friends not bound to them by the ties of blood. But the protection thus afforded was precarious, and liable at any time to be withdrawn, or to become powerless at the very moment when most needed. Living, thus, in constant dread of searches and visitations of the most unpleasant character, the Catholics found it necessary to secure around them every means of concealment or escape, and there are few of the old houses, occupied by them in those stirring times, that have not their hiding places and their secret passages, as reminiscences of times past we hope never to return. During this long season of persecution, at times, the power of the laws was allowed to slumber, and by a sort of connivance, the Catholics were permitted to remain un- molested. The rapidity with which the faith spread during these periods of repose soon re-awakened the jealousy of the enemies of the church, and again called into action the power of-law to sustain the church which had been estab- lished by law. But public opinion, at length, began to revolt against persecution. Toleration was granted to dissenters, and, by degrees, its effects slowly and gradually extended towards the Catholics. The struggle for religious liberty as involved in the question of Catholic emancipation, long and doubt- fully sustained, and at length in part successful, proved how strong was the intolerant feeling of the dominant power But the church had already begun to recover from her wounds, and to recruit her strength, and, with comparative I.    X       INTRODUCTORY' CHAPTER             i freedom came renewed energy and abundant sufccess. The  established church saw with dismay not only the poor and [ lowly, but the high and noble, and the choicest spirits of her own ministry, hastening to return to the fold of the an- cient faith. She beheld a new hierarchy about to rise up in place of the ancient bishops who had, long ago, been martyred or exiled. She feared the unity and power which the spiritual reaction would thus obtain; and she appealed once more to the power of the government to restrain by force what she felt herself unable to prevent by reason and' argument. But it was too late to return to -the rack, the scaffold and the axe. The ecclesiastical titles bill was the result: a law intended to destroy, as far as possible, at this day, the existence of the Catholic Church in the British dominions. It is not strange that a church established by act of Par- liament, sustained by the scaffold and the sword) should now in its decline, have recourse to an act of Parliament to perpetuate its existence and call in the power of the law to maintain itself against the power of truth. But fines and confiscations can not now effect what the dungeon, the torture, and the scaffold failed to do in times gone by. The milk white hind, though often doomed to death, is still!fated not to die. -In conclusion, it is only necessary to add, that this little book is addressed to the Catholics of England,- to picture the sufferings endured in other days for their faith, to re- mind them of the, patient courage of their forefathers in the midst of persecution, and to warn their persecutors how vain and impotent must always be the efforts of those who "are found even to fight against God."   PART FIRST. ^ Till David touched the sacred lyre, In silence lay th' unbreathing wire, But when he swept its chords along, Ev'n angels stoop'd to hear that song. ^ So sleeps the soul, till Thou, O LORD, Shall deign to touch its lifeless chord,- Till waked by Thee, its breath shall rise In music, worthy of the skies!"  MOORE. ^    -CHAPTER I. "There was a virtue in that scene, A spell of holiness around."-MooRE, THE sinking sun of a summer's eve lengthened out the shadows of the old trees, that adorned the grounds of Willitoft. Already the subdued light had swept over half the circular space, which was bounded by the gravelled carriage way, as it. wound round to the principal entrance of the venerable mansion. Under a clump of trees, a tall, grave figcrure was pacing to and-ro, deeply intent upon the pages of a book which he'held in his hand. At length he closed it, and crossing the grounds, towards the open space in front of the house, seated him- self in one of the oaken chairs, which were scattered along the edge of the wood. With his head uncovered, the better to enjoy the pleasant shade, he gazed out silently on the calm and placid scenery around him. At length, from the door of the mansion came forth a graceful young girl, and, followed by a staid and matronly aEttendant, bearing a watering pot, tripped lightly across the gravelled way to the flower beds which it encircled. The richest and rarest plants, and the most precious exotics   "       WILLITOFT, OR THE bloomed there, the evidence of the cultivated taste of the youthful florist. As she stood in the midst of her sweet, but silent favorites, she seemed in truth the fairest flower of them all-a bright young bud of sixteen, just breaking into bloom. Her person was finely moulded, yet girlish and undeveloped; but there was that about her every mo- tion which gave promise of surpassing beauty in maturity. Her complexion was very fair, but far from possessing any of that sickly delicacy which some affect to consider the perfec- tion of sentimental loveliness. The glow of life and health gave to her cheek a rich and lively tint, which came and went at every change of feeling. Her eyes were large, and of that soft deep light which sometimes marks tender and unhesitating self-devotion, and yet great firmness and reso- lution of spirit; but they could waken to a brighter sparkle, and flash with the fire of wit and merry mischief. Around a forehead neither too high nor too prominent for beauty, her light and sunny tresses were braided, falling in careless curls down her lovely neck and shoulders. With childish delight she bent over each favored flower, and, when her slower footed attendant joined her, she kept her busily employed with countless orders and directions, poured out with a volubility that quite confounded the good woman. Suddenly, as she hovered about, laughing mer- rily at the servant's occasional mistakes, her eye fell upon the figure seated under the group of trees. The moment that she had made her appearance on the scene, the old man had turned away from the contemplation of the more inani- mate beauties of nature, with a beaming smile, to watch the joyous and unaffected movements of the fair young girl. His lofty forehead, though crowned with the snows of age and slightly wrinkled, presented nothing of weakness in its appearance, but gave additional placidity to the calm   II           I]DAYS OF JAMES I.      15 bright eyes that looked out from beneath his massive brows. The cast of his features was of that full and bold propor- tion which marks the man of energetic purpose; and yet their predominant expression was one of calm and benevo- lent humility, which seemed to rest upon his fine counte- nance like a ray of sunshine on the still surface of deep waters. As soon as the young lady beheld him, the smile upon her lips became less light, and was replaced by a look of mingled affection and respect; and, leaving her attendant to fulfil the directions she had given, she turned her steps more gravely but not less buoyantly towards him. As she reached the spot she said, "Ah! father, you have been absent all the morn. To- day for, the first time for weeks you have omitted bestowing on me your morning benison." "Heaven bless you, my dear child, and the saints have you in their keeping," said the old man in an affectionate and solemn tone, as she knelt before him; and after a moment's pause, he added, "could you, my good girl, sup- pose for one moment, that your old friend would forget, absent or present, to ask blessings on your head?" "No, no; I do believe you are too kind and too good to forget in your prayers, even your careless and giddy pupil." "Nay, now, my child, you do both of us injustice. To be kind and good to you requires no great effort: it would indeed be singular that any one who knew you could be otherwise---and, surely, none can say that Julia Travers is an inapt scholar." "Ah! my dear master, you flatter your poor scholar," said the young lady, as her cheek-slightly suffused with pleasure, " you, who have so often reproved the flatterer!- When shall wonders cease?  But pray-if it be proper for  16        WILLITOFT, OR THE a thoughtless girl like me to know-where have you passed your time since yesternoon? I have been very anxious for  you, I assure you." Like Eve yet-and true to the honor of the sex, my saucy pupil!" replied the old man with a quiet smile, which however gave place to a graver look as he continued: "Yes, there is more cause for anxiety among us now than formerly. The laws against our poor oppressed people, you are awar-erhave been somewhat less rigorously executed of late, and there has been less actual persecution than for- merly. But this relaxation was destined to be of only short duration. It would seem as if our pursuers had paused in weariness, but to resume again with freshened vigor their assaults upon us." "Alas! I had hoped that at length we should rest in peace, and be permitted to enjoy at least the secret profes- sion of our faith." "We must submit to the will of God, my child. For our own good only, does he permit us to be tried. Doubt- less our gracious king has been led astray by designing or prejudiced advisers, or he would not have allowed a large and faithful body of his subjects to be thus hunted down. However, I will not judge his motives nor theirs. Yet the renewal of this flame has had something to do with my temporary absence, and may eventually compel me to leave you all for awhile." "Oh, I hope not!--Surely the danger is not yet so pressing." "'For the danger-I am inured to that-and it will not threaten you when I am gone. We poor priests bring de- struction to those who receive and comfort us," he said with a sigh. "However, an old man like myself is apt to be too fearful of the future, too foreboding, as youth isltoo   DAYS OF JAMES I.        17 confident and hopeful: come, I will tell you how I was delayed on my visit yesterday. In the morning I received a message from an unfortunate man, who, in times long past, had conformed to the established church. Conscience had been at work; he could not stifle its voice; and in the agony of a sick. perhaps a dying bed, he sent for me in or- dfer that he mighlt make his peace with the church and pre- pare himself for the dread future which awaits us all." The .venerable man paused for a moment, and then re- sumed. "Sit down by me, and I will tell you. a sad tale. Your young heart has not yet learned much of the sorrows of this world; perhaps it will be well for you to gaze upon some of the darker as well as the brighter scenes that are enacted in the life of man. It will serve to prepare you for the trials which may furrow even your young brow, and teach you the necessity of adhering to your holy faith if you wish to secure true happiness on earth." Julia cast herself upon the soft yet-well shaven grass at his feet, and looking up into his face, listened without in- terruption to his narrative. "The distance is not great from your father's house to a lovely little cottage embowered among those hills, from which yonder pretty stream in the plain below--now just visible through the opening in the trees-takes its rise. It is a spot which seems the residence of rural happiness. -Its inmates are a small and amiable family-a husband and his wife. Their whole treasure is their children, the oldest of whom, some seven years of age, acted as my guide-- their name is Hurlstone-" "John Hurlstone, was it, Father?" "Yes John Hurlstone, and his wife's name was--" "Mary'-good Mary Hurlstone. She was my attendant in my childhood-half a playmate, too, though much older.   18-       WILLITOFT, OR THE She was a good girl, and much I regretted her loss when she married and left our house." t But there was a third person, there, whom you have never seen, I think. he was older than John, some eight or ten years, perhaps; and far from possessing the same amiability of countenance as his brother, the husband of your quondam attendant. His features were dark and stern, and, even under the prostration of severe and pain- ful illness, his eye still flashed with that firm, quick glance, which marks the man who has mingled much in the world's fierce strife. He was pale and much emaciated, and yet there was a strong resemblance between him and the younger and happier, man who stood by his bed-side. As I entered, he turned towards me, and a sudden flush over- spread his face; it was but for a moment, and was suc- ceeded by his former paleness. I whispered some words of comfort in his ear, when he interrupted me, exclaiming: "'I shall not die yet; no--not-yet. I feel it.' "Ah my son," I replied, "you know not the day nor the hour, but you should prepare to meet your God, what- ever moment it may please him to summon you." "' You are a true priest, are you?' he said quickly, 'not one of those new church priests?' "'I am a Catholic priest,' I answered. "He remained silent for a few moments, and then turned again towards me, and addressed me: 'I have wronged many of your brethren, wronged them to the death, and  now the memory comes back upon me, weighing me down  and crushing me to despair.'  "I offered him consolation, and bade him hope in the i mercy of him who had died to save all men. His agony of mind was great, yet he humbled his spirit, and was ready to make his submission, to confess his sins, and to        .          i   DAYS OF JAMES I.        19 do penance for them. I sat by his bed-side several hours, and soothed and comforted his restless spirit; and, ere night closed in, I had the exceeding happiness of leading back his wandering steps to the true fold, and receiving him again within its bosom. I left him with the hope of life still strong within him, and yet perfectly resigned to die. He desired life, he- said, only that he might expiate the evil deeds of, his past years, and make some atonement for the bad example he had given. Sickness had overtaken him in the midst of evil schemes, in this part of the coun- try whither he had been sent by one of his companions on a project which had not yet been developed to him, and he was received into the house of his brother, as they thought,. to die. "As I was about to depart from the house, leaving him a happier, and I trust, a better man, I met the younger brother hastening to the door from the road with a face full of alarm. He hurried me back into the house, and without a word of explanation, bade me follow him to the garret. As I had lately heard rumors of various arrests of our un- fortunate brethren in the faith, I began to fear that informers were upon us. While I was concealing myself, he told me that several times during the, evening, he had seen two men hanging about the neighborhood, and that now they were coming directly towards his house. Fearing lest they might suspect my character, if discovered with a sick man, and immediately arrest me, he had hurried me to the most secure hiding place his cottage afforded. Then having pointed out an opening in the thatch by which I could escape through the roof in case the persons attempted to search the loft, he left me. For some time I lay in sus- pense, offering up my prayers to God for this suffering land and his true people within its borders. "At length I heard strange voices below, in colloquy, but   -20   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I. I was unable to discover the import of their -words. In a short time, however, the sounds ceased; and I had hoped that the suspicious strangers had departed; but after a brief interval, I heard them again. My situation was uncom- fortable in the extreme.. Hknew not what dangers were gathering round me, but I trusted in God, and left all things to him. After several weary hours had rolled on, I heard a footstep on the ladder, the trap opened, and Hurlstone entered. I only knew him by his voice, for it was long since too dark to distinguish any object in the low and nar- row loft. He informed-me that the men had gone, that their ostensible object was the arrest of a felon, whom they pre- tended to have traced into that neighborhood; their real purpose he believed to be the spying out of priests, and those who harbored them. His agitation was extreme, for the consequences to him would have been fearful, had I been discovered in his house, especially after having re- conciled a 'pervert' there, the' penalty of which you know is death. The fears of the good man for my safety, induced me to remain until near the dawn, when, having seen the sick man, and found him somewhat better, I left the cottage, and; after visiting several houses on my way, returned hither in safety. I immediately betook myself to to my chamber to prepare myself for any event, and to snatch a moment's repose. This, my dear child, is the reason that you have not seen me sooner to-day." Julia Travers sat in silence; meditating on the narrative which she had just heard. The venerable priest did not  resume the subject, but turned his eye towards the plain, below. The sun was just setting behind the hills, tinging the-sky and earth, and the placid stream, with a rich glow of light. The few clouds that floated over the heavens, caught the glorious flood as it swept up'the sky, and seemed like golden foam upon an azure sea. c   CHAPTER II. A bright glad land it was Until the tyrant with remorseless hand, Struck down its beauty, and its shrines defaced.-ANoN. T was a fit time and place for prayer, with the- glorious sunset, as it were, lighting up the temple and the altar; and the pure harmony of nature's vesper hymn, accompanying and giving voice to the heart's unspoken orison. The scene, the hour, might well awaken holy and tranquil thoughts. Like a life well spent, day seem- ed just verging to its close, with the sighs of earth and sky, and drooping flower, and every living thing for its depar- ture, mingling with certain hope of its brighter dawning into light and love, beyond the momentary darkness. So thought Father Tichbourne, as he sat quietly gazing upon the scene before him, and many a heartfelt prayer mingled in his meditations, many an aspiration that thus might close the, evening of his days. We have said that he was old and venerable in his appearance, and yet his years were not so many as a casual glance would have indicated. Many hardships and sufferings, long and severe toil,-a life of constant peril and of ceaseless trial, had silvered o'er his hair, and prematurely stamped the mark of age upon his brow. Fifty years and more had been his term of life; yet twenty years of missionary labors had made him seem much older. Abstemious and regular in all his habits, his frame was strong and hardy, and his limbs as active as in younger days. He had seen many changes in England. As a priest, he had been several times ban- i          ",   22       S WILLITOFT, OR THE ished, but had as often returned to his charge,- fearing the neglect of his duty, more than the punishments of men. Born of a respectable family, he had in early life discovered a desire for the priesthood, and, after having been fully satisfied of his vocation, applied himself to the necessary studies, and in due time, was raised to the sacred order to which he aspired. He had been the instrument of much good in the rural districts of England, whither he was de- spatched; had restored many wandering sheep to the true fold, and preserved those under his charge from becoming the prey of the ravening wolves who were seeking their spiritual destruction. For more than a year, Father Tich- bourne had received an asylum at Willitoft, in the ostensible capacity, and in reality fulfilling the duties of tutor to Julia Travers, the young and amiable daughter of the proprietor of the mansion, Although the good priest devoted much attention to'the delightful occupation of training the pliant mind of the young girl, yet there were other and graver duties which required his constant attention. He was, therefore, frequently compelled to absent himself for weeks at a time, from the hospitable doors of Willitoft, whilst occupied in visiting the more distant portion of his mission, or in supplying the loss of some priest who had been dis- covered and arrested in the performance of his pastoral duties. This was well known at Willitoft, and the good priest came and went unquestioned, save by his young pupil, whose affectionate curiosity often induced her to enquire the cause and history of his wanderings. Some times the good old man would gratify her anxiety; and, as in the present instance, relate his adventures to her; but, occasionally he would refuse to comply, accompanyingthe denial with kind and winning words that atoned completely for the disappointment.   DAYS OF JAMES I.       23  The tutor and his pupil formed a strange contrast;-he, grave and thoughtful, with the marks of sad memories on his brow; she young and buoyant, and, even in her sadder mood, like the warm sun of May half shrouded by a veil of mist. - The one -had seen long years of toil and sorrow- the other was just treading upon the threshold of life,- teem- ing, in her bright fancy, with love and joy and flowers.--It was the meeting of the spring and autumn of existence. At length Father Tichbourne arose and prepared to re- turn to the house. "I must see your father, my dear child, in relation to these matters, and consult with him upon the best course to pursue. I hope you will be cautious and avoid unne- cessary communication concerning it. Indeed," he added with a serious smile, "I have informed you of it, that you might learn at once to add discretion and prudence to your other accomplishments." "Trust me, good father, I shall not needlessly relate this occurrence. I do most heartily wish it had never hap- jpened, as I shall be in constant dread while these men remain in the neighborhood." "Now, Julia, you suffer it to depress you too much.- Thus it is in youth-ever at extremes. But," he continued cheerfully, "I do not overrate the matter, for after all it may be but a silly mistake on the part of John Hurlstone, who " doubtless was over anxious for my safety." "Do'you think so?" she said, earnestly. "I doubt me there is too much truth in his surmises. I only suggest the possibility of a mistake on his part." They were now crossing the open space, which lay be- tween the scattered groups of oaks and the main entrance of the house. The old servant had fulfilled .her duties to the flowers and long since returned within doors, and they   24       WILLITOFT, OR THE seemed to be the only persons on the scene. Yet, as they entered the gravelled carriage way and strolled slowly along it, two other figures approached towards them across the grounds, in a direction nearly opposite to the lodge, and aiming apparuently to ct them off from the house. At first, these men had -been somewhat concealed by the groups of trees, but now they emerged into the open space, and at a quicker pace hastened across it towards the priest and maiden. The sound of their footsteps attracted the atten- tion of the young lady towards them, and uttering a faint scream she was about to fly to the mansion; but the grace- ful and quiet salute of the one and the merry laugh of the other re-assured and detained her. A moment's glance satisfied her, and turning to the venerable priest, who stood calmly awaiting the result of this unexpected encounter, she said, blushing at the recollection of her timidity- "They are two gentlemen to whom our family owe much, as you know, I believe; the sons of a near and dear friend of my father, who has stood by us in many trials-my rela- tives, William and George Scott," she continued in a louder tone as the young men reached them and greeted her affec- tionately-"Mr. Tichbourne, my father's friend and my kind preceptor." The young men bowed politely but gravely, and the younger said: "My brother William has just returned, from Cambridge; and you know, Julia, I have been spending some time with that venerable aunt of mine who exacts from me an occa- sional residence at her lonely mansion; and as we both b happened to- rejoice the paternal residence at the same time,by our presence, we determined to ride over and see -,  you all. To shorten the way, I resorted to my old fashion !:    of scaling the wall, and actually induced my grave brother   I DAYS OF JAMES I.       25  to join me in the feat, whilst the servants brought the horses I round by the lodge. I certainly am happy to find you so well and so pretty-my dear friend." The speaker was a young man of about' twenty-one years of age, not quite so tall as his brother, but graceful 4 and well made. His face, though not actually handsome, was of that agreeable and intelligent cast, which always atones for the want of beauty in a man. His sparkling C eye was expressive of quick thought and readiness of exe- cution, whilst his features bore the stamp of a free, careless, yet noble soilt The elder brother, William Scott, was a man- of different mould and sterner stuff. His frame was tall and firmly knit, but the pallor of his face contrasted strangely with' the healthy hue of his brother's cheeks. His forehead, high and massive, marked a strong will and a clear and discerning judgment. His full brow shaded an eye, not bright and playful like his brother's, but of that steady glance which seems for ever peering into the hidden mysteries of thought. His hair was of the raven hue, and the dark line of the moustache upon his lip, served by the contrast to increase the paleness of his' cheek. A grave and thoughtful meaning floated ever on his features-some- times it deepened into sternness: and yet, in conversation, they were lit up with a quiet smile which occasionally ap- "I proached his brother's merry laugh. Then the strong re- semblance between the two, would have been detected by the most careless eye. While George was speaking to Julia Travers, William Scott gazed intently upon the priest, scrutinizing carefully every portion of his figure. There was evidently a degree of suspicion mingled in the expression of his countenance, as he turned away from the examination and addressed the young lady.   26       WILLITOFT, OR THE "I presume I must rejoice," he said, "to find my pretty cousin enjoying- means; of improvement and instruction which it is rarely the fortune of -any one in this retired dis- trict to obtain. Of course she has profited no little by the lessons of so reverend a tutor as Jlr. Tichbourne," The speaker laid a peculiar stress upon the words itali- cized, keeping his eye- fixed upon the priest the while. If he had expected to move the object of his suspicions into any confirmation of them, or to elicit any evidence of fear or surprise -he was disappointed. Father Tichbourne had been schooled too long and well in trials and adversities, to fpermit any such emotion to appear upon his counten- ance. Not so, however, with Julia Travers. The tell-tale blood which had before enriched her cheek, fled back to her fluttering heart. She knew tot what change time and the University might have wrought in William Scott: he had always been cold in his manners and in the expression of his feelings, and stern and uncompromising. in the per-, formance of what he conceived to be a duity. She did not believe him capable of playing the part of a spy, but,now that' his suspicions were aroused, she felt no assurance that he would not deem it an obligation to pursue his sur- mises, in order that the laws of the realm might be execut- ed, regardless of consequences. In the midst of her per- plexity and alarm she turned an imploring look towards the younger gentleman, who watched his brother's counte- nance with a frown upon his brow. Without hesitation or confusion, Father Tichbourne quietly replied: "I should scarcely have supposed but for your remarks, that those advantages you spoke of were so rare in this neighborhood. I can now well believe it. I certainly did not find Miss Travers deficient either in refinement or that true politeness which adorns equally either sex." amid,'       DAYS OF JAMES I.       27 "Well hit, well hit, my good sir," said George Scott, as his wonted smile returned again to his pleasant coun- tenance. 4"But you should have expressed the idea some- what plainer-my brother is blunt spoken, and must be bluntly spoken to. However, he is only jealous, and you must pardon him; for, years ago, hed acted as little Julia's teacher.-And, though little Julia has grown to be a tall young lady, I verily believe he would be her teacher still." For a moment a cloud sat upon the brow of the elder Scott, but it passed away and, with a degree of confusion, he said: "You are right, George. I have been impolite--coming as we did upon Mr. Travers' grounds, we had no right to question what we saw: and-to be plain--I hope you will pardon me for being so; I feel I have no right to inquire whether you are what you assume to be or not." "You mistake me, Sir," said Father Tichbourne, mildly, "I have assumed no character, that I am aware, which I am not fully entitled -to claim. Miss Travers has called me her tutor. I have the pleasure of acting in that capacity, and therefore it matters little lwhether I am more beside, or not, that I have neither affirmed nor denied." "I shall not stop to examine your logic; doubtless you are an adept in the casuist's art. I will, with your permis- sion, dismiss the unfortunate subject, which I have acci- dentally started, and make my apologies to my fair friend for my discourtesy." He smiled as he concluded, and with a graceful inclina- tion approached towards her. Taking his proffered hand, she immediately proposed that they should turn their steps towards the house, as the shadows of evening, already be- gan to thicken. As. they proceeded; the younger Scott drew himself to the side of Father Tichbourne, and engaged   28        WILLITOFT, OR THE him in conversation. The mildness and sincerity of the good priest, his earnest yet kind manner had a peculiar charm for the gay, reckless, and light hearted young man; and, although he more than suspected that he was convers- ing with a priest, and, perhaps, conniving at a breach of the laws of the realm, he felt that his heart was won. His sympathy wasaroused by the course of the conversation- and feeling himself called on to make some amends for the harshness of his brother, he said to him as they were about entering the door- "Pardon me, Sir, for what I am about to say: I do not desire your confidentce; indeed it were better that I should not have it, at all-but if you be a 'priest, as I fear you are, I pray you to avoid my brother for his sake and your own. He is acute, and so singularly wrapt up in his own zealous views of things, that if he should consider it a duty he would unhesitatingly deliver you up to the authorities; and, I know, not why, but since his entrance at the Univer- sity he is sadly changed, and most uncompromising." A blush overspread the face of the speaker, for he would rather have submitted to the penalties of the laws, than have violated the confidence implied in the privilege of unceremonious admission at Willitoft, contrary to the gen- eral rule of guarded seclusion which Catholics were com- pelled to maintain. The confusion of the young man was however unobserved by his companion; the light was alrea- dy too indistinct, and his mind was occupied with other thoughts. However, after a moment's pause, he said with a sigh:  "God bless you, my young friend, I believe your brother and yourself are both high-minded and honorable: and whatever I may be, I am sure I shall meet with nothing at your hands but honorable treatment. I blame no man   ?g     '  DAYS OF JAMES 1.       29 rashy for doing what he honestly believes to be a duty.-. If he be in error, I pray God to open his eyes soi that he / pause, ere he injure an innocent and unoffending man." As he finished they entered the room, into which their companions had already preceded them. This room, adorn- ed with anti qle furniture, contained two persons. They were brother and sister: the father and aunt of Julia Travers. There was a striking resemblance between father and daugh- ter, though his' hair, unlike the auburn tresses she had in- herited from her mother, had been originally black and thickly curling-but now a dash of gray was beginning to mingle with and absorb the darker shades. He seemed to be a much younger man than Father Tichbourne: but there was in reality but little difference between their ages. Twenty years ago he had sought in marriage the hand of Julia Scott, a distant relative of the two young men before him. She had smiled upon his suit in spit bf the differ- ence of religion that existed between them, and they were united with every promise of future happiness. Yet the brightest buds of hope are not always destined to bloom. Two fair sons who' were growing up around them, were snatched away by the hand of death just at that age when they had become tenfold dearer to their parents' hearts. Thus left childless, it seemed as if all their fondest pros- pects were blighted; and their cherished expectations bu- ried in the graves of their lost ones. God striketh in love and not in anger.-Chastened by the hand of sorrow, and taught by the consoling words of her stronger and more enduring husband, the bereaved mo- ther learne'd to look upward for strength to support her afflictions, and in time embraced the faith and fervently practised the precepts of the Catholic church. She died in giving birth to a daughter, who, when the first shock of 3*   30       WIILITOFT) OR THE grief had passed, became the hope and comfort of the de- solate father. SThe young Julia was entrusted to the care of her maiden aunt, who continued to preside over her brother's household from the death of his' wife, and to guide, direct, and cherish the orphan child with aill the affection of a mother. Sedate, though cheerful, she felt little sympathy for the gayer -portion of the sex; but was irresistibly attracted by the buoyant spirits of her young charge, as she grew up, and seemied to imbibe -from her presence the delioghtful freshness ofeiearly years. 'Now that Julia was approaching wpmanhoold, the affection which i existed between theai became strengtlhened and confirmed into that endearing confidence which ought to exist be- tweepl mother and daughlter. The reception which Mr. Travers gave his two young friends was warm and affectionate: his sister's, friendly and polite. Drawing the elder towards the light, the old gen- tleman, after a moment's examination, exclaimed: "Come, William, my boy, this will never do. Your cheek is as pale as a love-sick girl's. Toss away your law books and your classics: all the knowledge you may gain will never compensate you for the health its acquisition will cost you. You once possessed a ruddier complexion and a stronger constitution than your brother-but look at his cheeks now!" "I think you .are at fault," said the young man with a smile: " my health is good though my cheek be pale-my brother, too, has been devoting himself to study." "Studying mischief, I warrant me, or the mysteries of the brook or the chase. But, George, why have you been absent so long from our lonely dwelling?" "I am sure you do your house injustice: it never could be lonesome with such occupants as it possesses."   DAYS OF- JAMES I.,   .    31 "Ah! George: you have been studying the art of pleas- ing!" said Mr. Travers with a laugh.--"What say you, Aunt Nelly, shall we not give him a diploma for his pro- ficiency?" Aunt Nelly, for thus even the two Scotts called her, though no relatives at all, smiled whilst her brother conti- 'nued-"But you have not yet answered my question, Sir. Where have you been all this time? At your aunt's, whi- ther you informed us at parting that you were about going?" Verillyj I have Sit. Do you not admire my patience?" ,i It certainly is deservlng of some reward.',' During the earlier part of' the conversation,l Father Tich- bourne had determined to make his escape fi'om the apart- ment, as well for the purpose of reciting his office% as with a view of withdrawing from the presence of those upon whom the perilous knowledge of his calling might, perhaps, be uselessly forced. Therefore, gliding from the room at the first opportunity, he betook himself to the little oratory, where he was wont to celebrate the divine sacrifice in the presence of the family of Willitoft and such other Catholics as were able to assist at its consoling mysteries. Every thing in this little chapel betokened the dangerous times in which its frequenters lived. The altar was neatly and tastefully adorned with the usual furniture and orna- ments; and yet the whole was so arranged, that a quick hand, in a single instant, could remove every witness of that prohibited worship, leaving behind to the eve nothing but a plain oak table. Secret closets, dexterously fitted in the pannelling of the room, formed places of deposite for the plate and vestments that would have baffled the skill of the most cunning' pursuivant. The oratory was small, but was connected with the library by a concealed door, which, when thrown open, enlarged the chapel sufficiently to ac-   32       WILLITOFT, OR THE commodate all of the persecuted flock that dared from pru- dential reasons, assemble at one time. Father Tichbourne turned his steps towards the oratory which was situated in the second story of the western wing of the mansion. A single dim and shaded taper burned upon the altar. He' knelt in silence down. His departure was unnoticed; for Mr. Travers was busily engaged in conversation with William Scott upon the pre- sent state of his old University, and George and the young lady were chatting and laughing merrily; George, full of that keen sense of the ridiculous which many gay and lively persons possess, occasionaly made his grave elder brother the victim of some of his satirical shafts; yet his arrows were unbarbed, and never tipped with poison. The younger and more acute and energetic man had obtained a singular control over the elder, who, undoubtedly, surpassed him in intellect and yielded only to him in will, moved by a strong affection and perhaps by that submission which studious and contemplative men often give in matters of conduct and policy to those more practical and worldly than them- selves. This, as it were patronising subjection, sometimes led William Scott into a grave accompaniment to his bro- ther's lighter mood-which never failed to recoil thus upon him. Indeed, George was in the midst of a full, and per- haps somewhat warmly colored picture of the dangers and difficulties which beset his studious brother in the unwonted experiment of clambering over a high enclosure, when the narrative was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of a ser- vant evidently laboring under no slight degree of alarm. The poor fellow, as he sprang across the threshold, stopped, dismayed by the appearance of visitors whom -he did not expect to see. Turning towards his master, he gazed upon him unable to utter the words which clung to his lips. ! .   DAYS OF JAMES I.        33 "What is the meaning of this, John?" said Mr. Travers, somewhat sternly. "What is the matter?" "The pur- men, Sir-the porter says, Sir, there are two pursuivants at the gate, who insist upon entering and -" "Stop, sirrah!" said Mr. Travers; and striding to the door, he drew him from the room, followed by George Scott, "Now, proceed!" "Sir," said the man more calmly, " as I passed near the- the lodge, I heard two men demand admission in the king's name, as they were armed with a search-warrant for -" "Enough!" said Mr. Travers, " hasten back to the lodge, and bid the porter delay them as long as possible, but by no means use force!" The servant hastened to fulfil his commands, and Mr. Travers calling an 'attendant, ordered him to warn Father Tichbourne, and assist him in instant flight. As soon as he had ascertained the nature of the man's communication, George Scott returned into the, room, doubtful and perplexed. He dared not trust his brother's presence; for, if questioned, he would probably consider it a duty to unfold his suspicions to the pursuivants. In a moment, his resolution was taken. Striding rapidly by Julia, as she sat pale and breathless with anxiety, he ap- proached his brother. "Come, William, it is not fit that we should remain here- longer, we know not what may occur!" "For that very reason, George, I cannot go. I never will forsake afriend or kinsman in misfortune." "Forsake!" exclaimed- George, "nor will Hbut yout know not the nature of the danger which hangs over him.. I tell you our presence must increase his peril." "That cannot be, my bother," said William Scott, calmly..   3-84      WILLITOFT, OR THE "Ay but it can and will!" replied George, passionately. "You have heard, doubtless, of bloody laws and bloody executioners of those laws; and how-learned judges of this realm of England exert their ingenuity to strain those bloody laws and clutch within -their grasp every friend and comforter. as 'aider' or 'abettor.' You are a lawyer, or will be one, and know this better than I, and perhaps, with your stern sense of 'duty,' may some day not far hence assist in this most merciful occupation!" "George, you are cruel in, your surmises, and unjust and vehement in your language. Surely the occasion does not require this. May not even my little knowledge of the law avail our kinsman somewhat in this emergency, if the laws have any connexion with it?--for I have yet to learn what is the precise cause of this sudden disturbance." "For heaven's sake, brother!" exclaimed the impatient youth, " if you love me, be ruled by me now! What I ask is but little. Come with me, and, perhaps, you will have cause to be grateful to me to the latest hour of your life." "Ever in boyhood, even, he has led me thus;" exclaimed William Scott, as he bid- adieu to the ladies and left the room in company with his brother. As they entered the hall and were about to quit the house, the sound of foot- steps approaching rapidly strk.-4lao n their ears: George Scott, for during the whole scene, his mind seemed the more active and resolute, paused for a moment; and then, as if his original purpose had yielded to another, he mut- tered, "it will do-it will do," retraced his steprgand, enter- ing a side, passage that led-away from-the main hall, hast- ened towards the- western wing. The elder brother remon- strated,-but the younger replied, "William, you 'are more learned than I,--but you know not how soon you may have cause to rejoice that I have   asDAYS OF JAMES I.       35 greater foresight than you. You think this trifling?-wait the issue!" In silence they proceeded, mounting a flight of stairs, and threading a narrow and tortuous passage until they reached the door of the library., Opening it softly he said, "Now, brother: I have sound reasons forwhat I ask, and young and careless as I am, you- have often found me in the right. Believe me so now, and remain till I return- I think," he muttered, as he closed the door and departed, , that I can prevent a search; I am not wont to be so scru- pulous as William, and these men must be driven off." The young man hastened back to-the room in which he had just left Julia and her aunt. Mr. Travers had already joined them, and the-party seemed to be awaiting in silence the approach of the officers. The return of George Sceat surprised them, but his presence afforded them hope and consolation. Julia had taken a seat by her father's side and reclined her head upon his breast, as if to shut out from view all the dangers which she feared might surround them, and to find a refuge near that heart which beat so fondly for her. The sound of the young inan's voice, for she dared not raise her head to see who had entered, chased away half of the gloom from her heart, and she sprung up with a joyous motion, exclaiming, "Oh, George, I thought you had deserted us in the hour of peril, and yet my feelings whispered to me that you could not be so faithless and unkind." "You did me justice, Julia. But cheer up, cheer up; this may be still but a slight cause for apprehension. At all events, I will strive to avert it. I have placed my con- scientious brother in the library; and trust to me to prevent a search.'   ;rj------- 36        WILLITOFT, OR THE As Mr. Travers suggested the danger of his discovery there -a servant entered -and informed him that he had searched in vain for Father Tichbourne to put him on his guard.               - "In the secret chapel--?" "He is-not there : nor in his chamber-perhaps he has already fled!-" "Thank heaven if it be so-but search the grounds and warn him if you find him -" Mr. Travers was interrupted by the loud summons of the officers, who had paused for a moment in front of the house to mature their plans and station guards at every entrance. Accompanied by George Scott, he hastened to the door, and, casting it open wide, he demanded why his household was disturbed at such an unseasonable hour. "In the name of the king," said a rough voice; and two pursuivants, with several attendant constables, burst rudely into the hall. "In the name of the king, and by his war- rant, we demand entrance, and proceed to search your dwelling." "No man can bow with greater reverence to the autho- rity of the king, or submit more readily to the warrants of his majesty's justices, than I," said Mr. Travers. "Permit me to examine your authority," said George Scott, stepping forward at this moment, and holding out his hand to receive the paper. "Nay, nay, I trust you not in that way, Sir," said the man, "I have seen warrants destroyed before now. I warn you not to resist or interfere" . "You are over cautious! It is well, however, and I can excuse you," said George Scott, soothingly--" for I per- ceive that you are a stranger in these parts, or you would   have known me better. My father is one of his majesty's justices of the peace." "It is Mr. George Scott," whispered one of the consta- bles in the ear of the pursuivant, " the best hearted gentle- man in all the shire--a good churchman and none of your papists." Without further hesitation, the officer placed the warrant in the hands of the young man, who perused it leisurely, by the light of the candle, in spite of the manifest impa- tience of the officer to proceed to its execution. "Ha, Justice Lockson-again!-Well, my good man, I perceive that it is correct in form, but the object is certainly very absurd. Trust me, you will not find that any priest is harbored by my friend, Mr. Travers; or that there are on his premises any popish books, or beads, or such matters. Verily, my good Sir," continued the young man turning to his friend, "this affair-which is of course some mistake of that thick-headed Lockson--will afford infinite amusement to my father when he hears it. I warrant the next meeting of the justices will have a hearty laugh oirer it." Several of the local constables, admirers of light hearted, generous, reckless, George Scott, began to side with him and became quite mirthful, when he continued; "Well, master pursuivant, could you not get up a little affair of this kind over at my father's-the thing will be still more amusing-it would frighten him a little at first- but-" "Perhaps I can," said the officer in a surly tone, " and it may not be so amnusing as you expect:-for you seem to forget the laws against aiders and abettors. Come, Sir, you start,-well, let me tell you, I am used to all these things-notithe first lord in all the land would stop me in the execution of this warrant: I have listened to you pa- 4   38       WILLITOFT, OR THE tiently, because you are all in my hands-I have guards stationed at every outlet, and there is no escape. Delay, me no longer, oi I summon you to assist in the execution of the search." George Scott perceived that he had mistaken the man's character, and he trembled for the consequences which might ensue from the discovery of his brother apparently concealed in the library, which, with the disclosures he might make, and his own baffled attempt to prevent a search, would seriously compromise them all. The two officers did not give him time for reflection, but in spite of the murmurs of their attendants, who, at least, did not pro-  mise to be very active in the search, pressed by him and began their operations. In the first room they found the two ladies, weeping and in great alarm; and giving it a cursory examination, they returned into the hall. Then, dividing into two bodies, they proceeded to search the re-  mainder of the house. It is not to be supposed that per-  sons so liable to such unpleasant visitations should be hardy " enough to make a display of the emblems of their proscrib-  ed faith. Accordingly, the searchers found nthing that  they sought for.  George Scott accompanied the pursuivant who had di- rected his steps towards the western wing. This man, whose name was Foxly, scanned every corner with his keen eye, regardless of the murmurs of his companions  who desired to abandon the attempt after they had searched  unsuccessfully the rooms adjacent to the library. Foxly  persisted; and with great anxiety the younger Scott at  length stood before the door of that roomn-he yet hoped  by a sign to put his brother on his guard. The pursuivant  laid his hand upon the latch :-it opened easily and the door swung slowly back. And now they entered. As the light To,^'   DAYS OF JAMES I.        39 of their torches swept full around the long room with its shelves of books, it rested on no human being but them- selves. His brother was no longer there. His heart leaped with joy, and his breath came free again, while, scarcely crediting his eyes, he followed the pursuivant in his minute examination after false shelves and hiding places, trap-doors and secret entrances. Yet he could not divest himself of a lingering apprehension.              ?   CHAPTER III. "( In their owh land no more their own ..... Where slaves, converted by the sword, Their mean,.apostate worship poured, And cursed the faith their sires adored. Yet has she hearts, 'mid all this ill, O'er all this wreck, high, buoyant still With hope and patience;-hearts that yet aLike gems, in darkness, issuing rays They've treasured from the sun that's set, Beam all the light of long lost days."--MOORE. v ^ US the door closed upon him, William Scott, with e.;lg a singular expression of mingle 1 shame and irri- tation on his brow, began to pace the floor of the library. As he moved slowly his light step fell almost noise- lessly upon the floor.  It was now dark; and, as he ap- proached the upper end of the apartment, a faint streak of light appeared to beam into it through some aperture from an adjoining room. As he came opposite the opening, he heard a subdued voice breathing forth a prayer to heaven; the words that fell upon his ear arrested his attention, and, looking almost involuntarily, his eye rested upon the figure. of Father Tichbourne, kneeling before a small altar arrayed in its usual ornaments, the unfailing evidence of its forbid-- den purpose.  A strange thrill crept over hini as he gazed, drinking in the words of burning charity and love, which fell from the old man's lips. Recollecting himself however he turned away ashamed to play the part of a li]stener, and, resumed his walk. If before this unlooked for discovery, his mind had been filled with doubt as to the propriety of his conduct, now   X WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES 1.  41 the fearful certainty that he was conniving at a breach of the laws rendered his mind almost distracted. He con- eluded at once from the broken exclamation of the servant, the perturbation of Mr. Travers, and his brother's anxiety, that the officers of the law were even now upon the search for this venerable man. How then account for the un- guarded prcence of the priest. Should he warn him of his danger? Should he at Once seek the pursuivants and deliver him up to justice. Justice-! such justice!-he shud- dered as the fearful thought came over him, picturing to his eye, in horrible distinctness, the rack, the trial, the sen- tence-a moral man-baiting to amuse the eager spectators --the dungeon of the condemned with all its horrors, and still worse, the hurdle and the gallows, the body cut down yet living from the rope; the heart still throbbing, torn from the mutilated breast, and cast, yet quivering, in the flames-and all for conscience' sake. He sickened to his very soul, as every terrible detail rushed before him, and mercy conquered. He felt that it could be no duty to deliver up a fellow-being to such fear- ful torture, and for what? And why did that meek old man; whose head was gray with years, who could not be ambi- tious or a seeker after power, for he could expect to find but death-who had' borne without a murmur his own taunts (ah! how he regretted them now!)-why did that man, thus patient and resigned, day after day, and year after year, nay, every hour of his life, endure the risk, and await the almost final certainty of at length suffering these dread- ful torments, this excruciating death? BWhy did he dare to face this bloody fate? Could he be one who would will- ingly lead souls astray? Was he not braving all this to bring souls to the knowledge of the true faith as he con- ceived it? How like the apostle of old in his noble since-   42       WILLITOFT) OR THE, rity, his mild endurance, his firm adherence to the line of duty! If the poor priest had been belied, might not the doctrines of his church have been misrepresented? Was he not bound by the very ground-work of the Reformation principles, to search out and inquire for himself?, Why, then, did the reformed church of England forbid the inquiry and crush opposition? Why did the establishment pursue with fines and penalties, prisons, death, the practice or the teaching of doctrines different from her own? It is time for me to inquire. These were the thoughts of a single moment, rapid but effective. "I will see this priest,--for priest he is! I will warn him that some danger impends!" exclaimed William Scott; and he strode towards the entrance. The noise of his footsteps startled the good priest from his devotions, for he had now begun to -recite his office, hitherto delayed by the incidents of the day. -There was no small degree of surprise mingled with alarm expressed upon his countenance, as he recognized in the intruder upon that sacred solitude, the man on whom he had been taught to look with suspicion. However, in an instant, the shade of doubt passed away, and his features resumed their wonted calm as he bade him enter. "Pardon me, Sir, for the liberty I have taken. M ly rea- sons are weighty for thus disturbing your privacy. Within the last few moments my heart has undergone a signal change. Unintentionally, I overheard your prayer to hea- ven, and saw all my first suspicions confirmed by evidence too strong to admit of doubt. You are a Catholic priest." "I know not wherefore you seek this, knowledge," re- plied Father Tichbourne. "I seek nolt this knowledge for your ill--but for my ad- vantage. As I listened to your voice, strange thoughts /   DAYS OF JAMES I.        43 ,forced themselves upon me arid distracted my mind upon a point which I had long believed set at rest for ever. I am not one to falter in the course of duty, and I would fain know from a Catholic priest what is the Catholic faith. I would know whether he admits it to be the damnable su- perstition which men, and eminent divines, of our church would represent it. They also say that yotK are cunning and filll of deceit." "They do not know us, I would hope," said Father Tichbourne, meekly casting down his eyes. "They surely are misled who represent us thus. God knows, I would not willingly lead astray to error the humblest creature that dwells on earth." "I would know first," a new idea starting up in his mind as he was about to warn the priest of his danger, " whether you hold that the Pdpe can absolve citizens and subjects from their allegiance to their king and country." "As I live, it is no doctrine of the Catholic Church," said Father Tichbourne, solemnly. "Popes have stood up as umpires between the sovereign and the people,--but they have ever been found upon the side of liberty. They have excommunicated the licentious tyrant--they have proclaim- ed the point where obedience ceased to be a virtue. Arid there," continued the old man, raising up to his full height, "there the duty of obedience ceases." I "Whilst you are discussing this point with me, a danger hangs over you ;--perhaps the officers of the law, of our common sovereign, are seeking you as a violator of that law-as a traitor to your country. Will you submit to that law, or will you avoid or resist it?" "I am a man of peace," replied Father Tichbourne, calmly, "I can resist no force. I may well avoid the hand of unrighteous violence. The law of God is more binding   "       WILLITOFT, OR THE than the law of man; therefore the law of man forbids me in vain to obey the law of God. I will suffer its penalty without complaint, that is the only obedience I will yield it." "Perhaps the law of God does not conflict here with the law of man. You are not compelled to be a priest," said William Scott. "Truly this is no time for argument," said the venerable priest; a sudden doubt springing to his mind as to the real object of his unexpected visitor, "or I might tell you of a divine commission delivered to me, as to every priest, by a successor of the apostles, to go forth and preach the Gos- pel to- all men; and point you to him, the chief of the first chosen, who wondrously passed from the chains of the dungeon to preach the new revelation in the very porch of the temple, in despite of the-commands of the, princes arid rulers. Yet higher might Igo. Are you satisfied?" "That you are doing what you consider right, I am satis-  fled; but yet I know not that you are right. Nay, I will  speak plainly, I do believe that you are teaching a false doctrine, and serving a corrupted church." "That may not be, Sir, that may not be," exclaimed Fa- ther Tichbourne with deep feeling. "The Church which I serve is the work of God which cannot be corrupted; and the doctrine which I teach, is that which was delivered to the Apostles by the Saviour of the world. Ah! my son, reflect well upon your words-a corrupted church! What mean those simple words? They are pregnant with unan- swerable argument.- Grant this expression true, and if you  are logical you must become an unbeliever and a scoffer at  religion!" A smile, perhaps of scorn, passed over the fine features of William Scott, as he listened to the venerable priest, who, enlisted upon his favorite duty, the defence of the    DAYS OF JAMES I.        45 faith, seemed to forget all the dangers which surrounded him. A moment afterwards, the young man's countenance became more grave, and the seriousness of the subject, per- haps the idea just started, appeared to sink into his heart and impress deeply his naturally thoughtful and inquiring mind. "Yes! a scoffer and an unbeliever! and I say it in deep sorrow, for I know its truth. What is a corrupted church? One which was once uncorrupt-pure--the true church! For only the true church could be uncorrupt and pure; and the mark of the true church is that it is one. There can be no two true churches-for truth is one and unchange- able. This church, which you have called corrupted, must therefore have been the true church before its supposed cor- ruption. Then those who taught doctrines different from hers, were false and delusive teachers; and every form of belief, or church or doctrine different from hers, being dif- ferent from the truth, must therefore have been necessarily false. Now the church continued pure, or it did not. If it did, then it is-not corrupted, but is still the true church. If it-did not continue pure, but taught false doctrines, the true doctrine must have ceased upon the earth, for we have seen that none but she had ever possessed it.-There must, then, no longer be a true church:-the promises of Christ have failed, and Christianity is a mockery and delu- sion." The speaker paused, for the sound of distant footsteps struck faintly on his ear; and, in the next moment, he heard the door of the library swing open and many persons enter. He turned his eye upon the secret entrance, but William Scott had closed it tightly and securely. It was a moment of deep anxiety to the two men thus strangely brought together in that holy but dangerous spot. The faint light of the taper still burning on the little altar shed , ' +                I : *   "       WILLITOFT, OR THE an indistinct and mellow glow throughout the small apart- ment, heightening the solemnity and stern beauty of the scene. The old priest stood full in the sweep of the dim rays, robed in black, with his white hairs uncovered, his  eyes turned up to heaven, and his arms folded across his massive breast. He was the picture of patient resigna- tion. In strong contrast with him stood William Scott, his brow contracted with the stern workings of his spirit and the rapid flush of excited thought. The position in which he was placed was novel: he saw his danger, yet he knew not how to avoid it. Every step he had taken in the course of that, eventful evening, seemed destined to in- volve him deeper in the meshes of unforeseen difficulties. He had come to Willitoft with his heart imbued with the firmest principles of church supremacy, and now he stood .- by the side of a Catholic priest glistening to his words with at least awakened doubts,-liable to be convicted by the  force of circumstances of aiding and abetting in the con-  cealment of that priest. There seemed now to be no es-  cape. It was impossible to turn back or falter. He must  press onward. He turned an inquiring glance on Father Tichbourne, for he felt that something must be done for common safety, and found the eye of the venerable priest fixed upon him as if it would pierce his soul. The steps of the searchers were approaching nearer the secret en- trance; and it might have been- that Father Tichbourne suspected some connexion between the unexpected intru- sion of the man who stood before him, and the approach  of the officers of justice. Suddenly William Scott exclaim-  ed in a low voice, pointing to the altar  "There is the unimpeachable testimony, which may de-  prive you of life, and me of liberty! Is there no mode of concealment or escape?"    J DAYS OF JAMES I.       47 The look and action of the young man satisfied Father Ti6hbourne's doubts, and he replied quickly in the same low tone, "Then, I have wronged you in my suspicions: I began to fear that your presence here was connected with their search, and that flight was hopeless-pardon me."                      I So saying, he moved lightly towards a portion of the panelling of the room, and touching a secret spring, pushed back a sliding door, which opened on a narrow stairway, built in the thickness of the wall. Placing the taper in the hands of the young man, he bade him enter. A single moment served to divest the altar of all its sacred orna- ments and to bestow them in their proper places of depo- site; and, ere the priest entered the secret passage, he saw that the room no longer bore evidence of his persecuted faith, and its prohibited sacrifice. He carefully closed the panel behind him, and taking the light, preceded his com- panion down the stairway. As he reached the landing he paused and listened attentively- "There are guards here," he said at length, "I hear their voices: therefore you must learn yet another secret, which is confided to your honor," and stooping down he raised a nicely fitted trap opening into a vault below the building. A secret passage led up to the open air into the midst of a thick double row of hedge, which wound around the labyrinthian walks to the verge of the forest. As they reached the end of the subterranean passage, Father Tich- bourne extinguished the light, and-pausing, addressed William Scott: "After what has already passed, there is need Af less reserve between us-may I ask some explanation of these strange occurrences." "What I know of them I will tell you," replied Scott; --------- -rrr v VIII  * L1 JW.   48        WILLITOFT,-OR THE and then he detailed the incidents of the evening up to his sudden entrance into the chapel.  "It is strange I received no warning," said Father Tich- bourne, musing. "I had been strolling in the forest, how- ever, and just returned to the chapel a few moments before you found me there. Perhaps they had sought me in the chapel, and not finding me there, heedlessly left the en- trance but half closed, and looked for me elsewhere, whilst I returned by the secret way. Else we had not met so strangely." "And I have thus involved myself by listening to the unreasonable wishes of my brother." "I will hope another and a higher hand has shaped the course of this adventure! God grant it in his mercy a favorable issue. Let us look forth." The sky was no longer calm and unclouded: dark masses of storm clouds drifted rapidly upon the-currents of wind  which rushed among the groups of lofty trees, bending and  tossing their strong branches, and sobbing as it were over the fury of its own wrath. Ever and anon, the bright broad i face of the moon burst full into view, casting a gleam of  silvery light upon the dim earth below, as the sea of clouds broke and shifted in their rapid course. And then, again the scattered masses, uniting together, swept over and hid her mild beauties, and clothed the earth in deeper darkness. Large drops of rain began to fall, and the distant rumbling of the thunder foreboded a night of fearful and terrific storm. "Shall we remain here and await the issue," said Father Tichbourne turning to his companion; " or go forth in the midst of darkness and threatening tempest?" "Better storm and darkness, than the risk of the hang- man's grasp or the dungeon's bolts and bars! better the fierce fury of nature in her anger, than the tender mercies   DAYS OF JAMES I.       49 of Christian man! This night has taught me a fearful lesson in the law of charity! I have experienced the feelings of one in dangeriof the penalties of crime, and yet conscious of my innocence." "Be it so!" replied Father Tichbourne; and heedless of the lowering sky and warring elements, the two compan- ions in concealment-the young student and the venerable priest-went forth to seek safety in the forest. At length they paused and turning towards the building stood gazing upon it in unbroken silence. The light of torches was flashing from window to window, and the dark shadows, which ever and anon shot athwart them, displayed in giant proportions the figures of the officers. The search was going on with activity. They looked but for a moment, and resumed'their course. They were now some distance from the house and on the verge of a thick plantation of trees whose dark and heavy foliage would at once protect them from the descending rain and prevent discovery by any wandering eye, in the casual beaming of the moon. William Scott renewed the conversation. "We are now, I suppose in comparative security, for in such a night they will scarcely undertake to search tie forest; and I would fain hear something more from you on the subject we were discussing when interrupted so disa- greeably. Your argument has excited strange thoughts in my mind, and during our silent walk, I have endeavored to satisfy myself that it is only a play upon the word corrupted." "Assume the word corrupt," replied Father Tichbourne, "and yet you perceive the meaning is the same: the idea you desire to expiress-being evidently that the Catholic church is a fallen church. Your assertion admits, as all of her opponents must admit, that at some one period of her V    WILLITOFT, OR THE existence, she, and she only, was the true church of Christ; that she alone possessed the true faith and taught the true doctrine. You must admit this or you must seek in vain for a source by which to derive your asserted succession of orders, and renounce for ever the futile endeavor to con- nect your sect with the Apostles of Christ. I care not in what age this period of purity may be placed, whether sim- ply in the time of the Apostles, or whether you will extend it to the days of Constantine. You may go still farther if you choose, following the guidance of leaders of your sect, and permit its purity of doctrine to enter uncontaminated the very portals of the misnamed 'dark ages.' Assume which period you please, the argument will apply as well to one as to the other." "I certainly do admit," said William Scott, "that in the early ages of the Church of Rome, her doctrine was pure and scriptural, and her practice apostolic. But I must de- clare my belief that even in those-early ages the seeds of corruption were sown, and that they grew up with her growth and strengthened with her strength. Yet the march of that decay was slow-and imperceptible." "I give you due credit for acuteness," replied Father Tichbourne; " Certainly, that is the strongest position you can assume. Strong as it would be were the Church of Christ a mere human institution, capable of progression or retrogression in its faith and purity, it becomes ineffably weak when you admit it to be divine-the work of God. As he framed it, so must it ever remain;-its doctrines, its faith, its sacraments, came perfect from his hands. They were necessarily true, because he had revealed or estab- lished them, and not because men might understand, or reason substantiate them;-for there are some, to which man must bow and-reason succumb--which are far beyond   the grasp of human comprehension. Therefore when the truth of any article of religion is in question, it is a mere matter of evidence not of comprehension: it is only neces- sary to inquire whether it be revealed; if it be revealed, it is true." "I admit the position," said William Scott, " it is incon- trovertible; and because it is-so, I do contend that the Church of Rome is in p1'or, professing and teaching many doctrines never revealed by Christ, and not contained in the holy Scriptures." "Then we are at issue upon this point, and it is a point of evidence," replied Father Tichbourne. "And now for the proof. Though I might fairly call on you to sustain your assertion, I will pass it and go on to maintain my own position. The Doctrine of Christ, and therefore of the true Church, was revealed whole and entire, that is, it was per- fect as believed by the primitive Christians: now while this doctrine remained unchanged, it must have continued pure, being the same revealed by Christ. But the moment that the Church taught or began to teach any thing in addition to, or to omit any portion of that doctrine, she taught a false doctrine, and she ceased to be the true church." "Yet the truth was still-mingled with the falsehood, the truth therefore was not-lost;" interposed William Scott. "But the Church," resumed Father Tichbourne, "was in the case supposed, teaching false doctrines; and that false teaching in which there is a mixture of truth is only more dangerous because less palpable-it is not less false. There must have been some specific point of time at which this false doctrine -was introduced, and, prior to which, it did not exist: there must have been some one teacher who first introduced it. Up to the very point, then, at which the first false doctrine was sown, the faith taught by the   652       WILLITOFT, OR THE Church was undeniably pure, and the test of its purity was its antiquity, its conformity with the faith taught by the Apostles. Now, the error just supposed to be broached, would bear upon its face the stamp of novelty. Its novelty would of itself condemn it. It would prove it to be differ- ent from that which was revealed to the Apostles, and de- livered by them to their successors, as conservators of the faith. And would not those conservators immediately cry out against this novelty, and cut off by the sentence of excommunication those who' taught and who received it? And is not the supposition I have made, sustained by the whole course of ecclesiastical history? Whenever any one was unfortunate enough to introduce a novelty, to teach a doctrine different from that received from the Apostles, did not the whole Church give testimony against him, and was he not cut off as a heretic? Else, how account for the  many excommunications of ancient heretics, apd the con-  demnation of their doctrines? Thus the moment an inno-  vation appeared, it was cut off; the old faith continued ! unchanged,-the new doctrine, if it did not perish, existed in a sect, a heresy. How carefully the Church guarded from innovation the sacred deposite of faith, is testified by the exclamation of St. Paul to the Galatians when some endeavored to pervert the faith: 'But though we or an angel from heaven preach a Gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.-For neither did: I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the reve- lation of Jesus Christ.' It was his solemn injunction, that whoever preached a new doctrine should be anathematised; -he and his followers would thus be separated from the true flock. The Faith itself and the Church could not be corrupted by the attempted innovation, for its very incep- tion would be the signal for its condemnation. It would 8           *           ,   DAYS OF JAMES I.       53 be impossible, in the nature of things, that the new error could be incorporated with the old faith. This, Sir, may look like a mere human guard upon the purity of the faith; and without considering the providence of God working by this means-and even in that worldly point of view, you must admit it to be perfectly effectual." "It certainly would be," replied William Scott; "at least while the guards or conservators themselves remained pure 'and vigilant. But suppose the infection to have started with them?" "Define your position more closely," replied Father Tich- bourne. "Do you mean with all the bishops or conserva- tors of the faith, or with part of them, or simply with any one of them? If all, you come at once to the great foun- tain of the dispute, for you assert the Spirit to have de- parted from them. If not all, then your position is still within the sweep of the moral argument which I have ad- duced from the nature of the Church, for you suppose the remainder to continue firm adherents to the old and true faith and to oppose the introduction of the new heresy. At the setting out of this argument,-you will remember we supposed the point of time at which commenced the cor- ruption which you asserted had taken place in the Catholic faith, and I then glanced at the impossibility of sdch an introduction, while the bishops or part of them remained true to the faith, even without reference to the infallibility of the Church. In addition, therefore, to this view of the mere human means-of preserving the purity of the faith intact from the efforts of bold and rash innovators, you must call to mind the Power who is working through that means; who promised that he would be with his Church all days even unto the end, that he would send his Spirit to teach her all truth, and that the gates of hell should not 5*   54        WILLITOFT, OR THE prevail against her, and who added to these divine promises the threats of his eternal vengeance against those who should refuse to hear that Church. We find the obligation of obedience to this Church set forth too plainly to be mis- taken. We find the promise of Christ that his Spirit should guide, guard, and direct this Church, every where set forth; and we find it every where, and in all history admitted, that the Church of Rome and the whole Christian world in communion with her-at some time,--no matter how re-- mote,-was the true church. Then of course, this church, the Roman Catholic Church, was in the possession and fruition of the unfailing promises of Christ. She it was, that was built upon the Rock, and over her it was impossi- ble for the gates of hell, or the power of error, to prevail. She it was, with whom HE was to remain all days even to the end. She it was, whom his Spirit was to teach all truth, and whom all were commanded to hear,--as they  were commanded to hear Christ himself! Oh, perversity of human reason, blindness of human will! how have ye dark- ened and led astray poor, weak, failing man! How have ye decoyed him from the lowly path of true and confiding souls, substituting pride, and vain glory, and hypocrisy, for humility, and obedience, and sincerity; tossing your de- luded followers upon the sea of error, and driving them be- fore every wind of doctrine; calling forth false prophets and blind teachers, who have cast off the submission due to that holy Church, who have rejected her doctrines, tram- pled under foot her holy rites, and sacrificed those of her children who refused to desert her altars, to the bitter ha- tred which animated their hearts." As he spoke, the voice of the venerable priest arose clear and distinct above the tumult of the elements, and came full and firm upon the ear of the listener. The vivid light- s.               DAYS OF JAMtS I.        55 ning, rushing to the earth, in its forked course,( cast a bright, but momentary blaze across the scene; its lurid glare illuminating the sturdy oak'with its strong arms toss- ing wildly in the raging wind, the dark masses of clouds careering rapidly across the sky, the forest, and the earth around; whilst the mansion house stood forth in the un- earthly glow, lifting its pointed gables and stacks of chim- neys gleaming as it were with fire. Full upon the tall form of the speaker fell the flashing light of heaven.- His gray head was still bare, and his ven- erable locks' streamed in the wind, while heedless of the dashing rain which penetrated the leafy canopy above him, his face was upturned to heaven, and his hands outstretched. It was a wild scene, there, by that forest oak. A feeling of awe came over the heart of William Scott as he looked and listened. He felt that it was a meet scene, and a fitting temple, in which to declare the might and majesty of God, in which to acknowledge the vanity and littleness of man. Was it for man to ask a sign from the God of might who bade the thunders roll, and the lightnings flash, and the storm sweep on-who was the almighty mas- ter of those fearful elements which, in their wrath, made man, the creature, tremble and grow pale, and which, in all their grandeur and sublimity, were infinitely weak and poor before the face of him who made them? Well might the heart shrink within itself before its God, and yield obe- dience to his awful mandates. In the deep hour of night, in storm and darkness, and in danger, stood they there, the missionary priest and the startled student, busy with solemn thoughts, and silent: till, at length, the voice of the old man again arose, yet in calmer and milder tones.   56   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I. "My son, seest thou yon brilliant flash, sending its light far and wide over the earth, dazzling and overpowering, and dispersing the Cimmerian gloom! Thus upon the mind of him whom men of old called Saul, broke in the saving light of faith and knowledge. Thou knowest the story well, I doubt not. It- was no vain reasoning-not the evidence of his senses-but the exhibition of the power of the Almighty, the gift of his Holy Spirit. A voice issuing from that blaze of glory which had stricken him sightless to the earth, bade ,him go seek instructions from a lowly teacher. He bowed his head, he went, he heard, and he  believed. And Saul the. persecutor became the Apostle Paul.. My son, thou seekest :after truth; thou hast said it with a manly heart. By the help of God alone must thou hope to find it. From him, alone, cometh the gift of faith. Seek with prayer the light of his Spirit, and humble thy soul in his presence; and he will guide thee in the search! "See!" he continued, after a moment's pause; "the lights have long since left the western wing; let us return, for methinks the danger is -past!" Silent and thoughtful, William Scott followed the foot- steps of Father Ticibourne, as he proceeded towards the house. A short an-d rapid walk, for the tempest was still raging although its violence had somewhat abated, brought themn near'the mansion, where they paused to reconnoitre, for faint sounds again were heard in the w ang of the Gild- ing, and lights began again to pass from rom torom and flash across the windows. - '    CHAPTER IV. "There is a bright fountain, through that desert stealing, To pure lips alone its refreshment revealing-- What may that fountain be? 'Tis Truth, holy Truth, that, like springs under ground, By the gifted of Heaven alone can be found."-HYMN. )OHN FOXLY, the pursuivant who conducted the search in the library, brought all his nice skill to bear in the examination after secret hiding places, and, in spite of the reluctance of the local constabulary, who were somewhat controlled by the sneers of George Scott, did not pause in his work until he had, fallen upon the place of the secret door. It was not long before it yielded to his efforts; and they entered into the chapel. To the surprise of all, who now expected some startling discovery, nothing was to be seen but an oaken table rest- ing against the wall-no furniture, no utensil, no mark of use or occupation. "Wonderful man, you have discovered-a lumber room," said George Scott, rallying from the surprise and alarm which had at first filled his breast. "Strange that a lumber room should have a secret door to it," said Foxly, coldly-" it must have also one leading from it," and he continued his search. Here, too, he tried all the panelling, but it all seemed alike,hollow and yet im- movable in every part. .The officer was at fault:. and after a vain effort, considering that his game, if any had been there, had lonagsince flown, he abandoned the attempt, and retraced his steps to the front of the house, where he was   58       WILLTTOFT, OR THE joined by the second division of his party who had been alike unsuccessful. Calling in the guards whom he had stationed at the entrances, he questioned them, but they answered that no one had passed from the house; and he turned away from the door, muttering as he went, " our fel- lows surely dogged him hither, and yet the bird has flown. These Scotts are concerned--well, another time." The retiring officers were watched by a band of the ser- vants, until the gates of the park were safely locked behind them as they marched away in the pitiless rain, discontent- ed and out of humor-at their ill success, and cursing the peltings of the storm-. Words cannot tell the joy of Julia Travers, as she poured out her gratitude to Heaven, when George Scott informed her that the present danger was past. She threw herself into her father's arms, and wept upon his bosom; and, then, growing calmer, overwhelmed George Scott with thanks for the solicitude he had displayed for their safety, attributing to his presence their freedom from that rudeness and brutality which usually characterized the proceedings of the pursuivants. "But William?-it is time for us to think of William," exclaimed Mr. Travers, "his disappearance is singular. I can only account for it by supposing that he discovered the secret door from the chapel. Yet he could not have done that unaided. I will see into it," he continued, taking a light and hastening towards the library. Entering the little chapel, he threw open the secret sliding door, and called Father Tichbourne in a low tone, for he supposed that the priest might have concealed himself there. Receiving no answer, he descended the narrow stairway, opened a secret door, let into the side panelling of the massive door-way leading to the walks and shrubbery behind the mansion.   DAYS OF JAMES I.       59 Here he stood for a moment, holding the light above his head and shading it with his hand to protect it from the wind which still swept with considerable violence. As he lowered the torch; its rays fell full upon his face, and at the same instant, a joyful exclamation broke upon his ear, and rapid footsteps approached towards him. Father Tich- bourne and William Scott sthod before him. "Heaven be praised-it is you!" exclaimed Father Tich- bourne, " we feared the searchers had returned." "Thanks to God-no! they have departed-but come in from the rain," said Mr. Travers,-and continued as they hastened through the hall to the sitting room, "by what good providence, William, do I find you and my firiend to- gether?" "Father Tichbourne, you mean--yes, I know all"-re- plied William Scott-with a smile; " it would seem like a providence;-but really, it was the blundering of my bro-  { ther, who forced me to the library-my own curiosity which led me into your private chapel; and his promptness and your private stairways that took me into the storm without." "Say rather a higher power," whispered the priest. "And you, Father Tichbourne," said Mr. Travers, "how comes it you were so rash as to remain in the chapel, when the searchers were upon us? But I forget the servant found you nlOt." "I knew not of them, till this young gentleman inform. ed me. I had been walking in the park, and, seeing the storm coming on, betaken me to the chapel but a moment before he joined me there. Else I had been captured and you lost! You see, my friend, it was a kind and provident hand that led you thither, perhaps for still greater good." "Perhaps! who   knoweth?" repeated William  Scott, musingly. "It is indeed strange. I fled from no danger, I   60       WILLITOFT, OR THE into the midst of danger. I felt conscience-stricken when I endeavored to suppress a suspicion of the profession of this gentleman, as if I' had committed a great crime in not hunting him to destruction; and, lo you now! I stand be- side him calmly, knowing him to be a priest, and having aided him in his flightfrom the officers of the law:--and the reality moves me not as did the mere suspicion." "Rather have I aided you in your flight," said Father Tichbourne with a smile. "Though, why you should fly I know not-doubtless you were- as guiltless of any crime, against the laws of man, requiring concealment, as I was against the laws of God." "It is true," answered William Scott. "Your offence is only that you have obeyed the laws of God, as you under- stand them, rather than those of man. God commands you to preach and teach,-man forbids; and you preach and teach. Well. This much this night's terrible experi- ence hath taught me-to judge less harshy of men's mo- tives than I was wont to do, and to honor fortitude and patience in the discharge of a supposed, even were it a mistaken, duty." The venerable priest bowed his head in silence, and, without further remark, separated from his companions as they were about enteringthe sitting room and hastened to his little chamber to change his wet apparel. William Scott was now under the necessity of recounting to the anxious ladies, the history of his adventures; though he thought it prudent to pass lightly over the scene in the chapel, and the conversation in the forest. When he concluded, it was still raining, and as the lateness of the hour, and the incle- mency of the weather, rendered it imprudent to return home that night, the young men readily yielded to the soli- citations of Mr., Travers to pass the night at Willitoft.   DAYS OF JAMES I.        61 After the exciting scenes of the last few hours, the ladies felt it a relief to retire; and the usual family prayers were recited by the whole assembled household, with even more than usual fervor, to return thanks to God for his mercies to them all, and especially for his signal protection amid the trials through which they had just passed unharmed. Might we gaze upon that gentle maiden, reclining in peaceful slumbers, wrapt in confiding faith, enveloped in purity, protected by piety, watched over by the angel guar- dian, and dreaming of the joys of heaven amid the trials of earth? Truly a good conscience and a trust in God make a brave soul, a soft pillow, and a pleasant sleep. Beneath that roof there was another heart that rested not so quietly; another eye, that did not close; another pillow, on which no tranquil slumbers and sweet dreams descended. And yet that heart was not less earnest in its love of good, its search for truth, its ready compliance with duties once known and ascertained. William Scott addressed himself to rest; but sleep came not. The busy spirit wandered over many thoughts, stirring and wild in 'their hitherto untrodden pathways-like a wilderness of beauty unexplored; until, in the weariness of thinking, it seemed as if he had slept and dreamed. He closed his eyes; but still the flash of heaven's light seemed once more, with dazzling brilliancy, to illuminate the animated face and swelling form of the venerable priest; and those words rang again upon his ear, so full of meaning- "The persecutor Saul became the Apostle Paul!" Wherever he turned his eyes, they started out upon his strained orbs in letters of light, floating about in the impe- netrable darkness which surrounded him. He was no per- secutor! he had never imbrued his hands in his fellow's blood.-But had he not brought with him to that house, 6 s    a   62       WILLITOFT, OR THE the heart of a persecutor?--Had he not spoken with the spirit of one upon his lips?--Had he not debated in -his inmost soul whether he should not give up to the torture the mild and patient priest? "Yes I came as Saul, shall I go forth as Paul? Am I, in truth, in the blindness of ignorance? Alas! my soul is darkened, doubt is hanging over me, error is around me- whither shall I turn?" For a moment, he tossed himself upon his uneasy couch, and, at length, springing up, hopeless of rest, he began to pace the floor of his apartment. The wind was dying away without, faintly sobbing and sighing as it passed afar, bearing the remnants of the unspent storm to distant re- gions; and the large drops came dripping from the eaves  of the old house and from the trembling foliage like na- (! ture's tears shed over the past fury of her elements. The last clouds were sweeping down the horizon, and the moon, full and bright, and calmly beautiful, now looked forth placidly upon the earth as if no storm had just been raging there. The azure vault above, seeming the deep blue of heaven's eye,-sparkled with myriad stars, their twinkling light dimmed by the bright effulgence of the queen of night. The storm had passed; night in her ter- rifio grandeur had departed. And nature lay in the sweet calm of rest, in the soft rays of heaven's subdued brilliancy; and night, in her pure and virgin beauty, slumbered o'er the earth.  The scene, the hour, had charms for the mind of William Scott; and throwing up the window, he sat himself down to gaze upon it. The cool air fanned his temples, and soothed the throbbing of his excited pulse; and the quiet beauty of the moonlit earth recalled him to his wonted calmness. As he gazed out upon the scene, he could not   DAYS OF JAMES I.       63 but contrast its present placid loveliness with the wild ma- jesty of the past storm and darkness, and he exclaimed :-- "Such are our hearts! They are in the power of Him who holdeth the winds in his hand. Let me pray that peace may descend upon my troubled breast, as it hath come down upon the warring elements." He threw himself upon his knees and prayed long and fervently for light to guide his footsteps and lead him to the truth, if he were now a wanderer from its path. He most earnestly besought that precious grace of the Spirit of God, which would soften his heart and make him a sin- cere searcher after, and a willing recipient of, the truth wheresoever he might find it. As he arose, he felt that his heart was already lightened of half its burden, his spirit calmed, and his resolution strengthened. "I will examine this grave question thoroughly, and trust the end to God," he exclaimed. "But where and with what guide shall I begin?" he continued, as he again seated himself by the open window. "The Bible? And yet the thought of Church authority comes irresistibly upon me- for the creeds of all our churches, seem to me only to be their peculiar interpretation of the Bible: and each deno- mination brings forward that holy book as the testimony of its orthodoxy, claiming to be the expounder of the doc- trines contained in its pages. Which of all these guides and teachers shall I follow?" For a moment he sat and mused upon the wondrous dif- ferences of belief, and the contradictory creeds which had sprung from the reformation; and he shook his head mourns fully. He was earnest and conscientious-deeply imbued with the doctrines of the-Church of England as by law established, and yet he was so because he had thus been taught from early youth. Sincerely pious, he adhered to   "       WILLITOFT,/ OR THE its communion and fulfilled its behests, because he believed it to be the true church; and that sincerity and conscien- tiousness, springing as they did, from a love of God and a desire to save his own soul, made him question most tho- roughly the grounds on which her authority and orthodoxy rested, now that he had entered into the examination. Another, less pious than himself, and less sincere, would, perhaps, never have doubted, or have dismissed that doubt without examination, and gone on with quiet conscience to the end. Not so William Scott. There was now no rest for him until he had fully set that doubt at rest and satisfied his mind upon the truth of every doctrine he pro- fessed. He had never before hesitated in his faith: indeed, it had never occurred to him that the Church of England could possibly be wrong, and now, when for the first time he began closely and seriously to examine the commence-  ment of her existence as a separate church, (according to his notion) he found that there was much to startle, if not unsettle and entirely overthrow belief in her. "If I turn from her, which of all these churches must I hear? All call on me to listen to their behests-each one professing to be the church which the sacred Scriptures commands me to hear. Each points to the sacred volume as its commission and extracts from its pages a doctrine and a creed, different from, and contradictory to those of all the others. Is it possible that all these conflicting parts together can form one church?--that all these varying, changing and opposing doctrines, clashing together like the foaming waters of a whirlpool, can be the true, divine and perfect faith delivered by Christ to his Apostles and by them preached to the world? But one church dares boldly to define the marks of the true church,-and she proclaims that she alone fulfils those marks. 'It is one, holy, catholic   DAYS OF JAMES I.        65 apostolic.' And surely it seems reasonable that the church founded by him who was truth, and unity, and perfection, should be, united, perfect in doctrine,-with its members professing the same faith and bound together in the same communion, 'One body, one spirit-one Lord, one faith, one baptism.' 'There shall be one fold and one shepherd.' If these marks be true-where shall I find ' one body' pro- fessing one faith' and under' one shepherd?' Do these marks exist in the Church of England? True, I find some- thing resembling them;-but how much more perfect do they appear in the Roman Catholic communion. "But if my church does seem to possess these marks, whence does she derive them, together with her faith and her ordination? I trace them back to the days of Henry the 8th; nay, I cannot trace them thus far without discern- ing frequent changes and alterations in her doctrines and 'articlest' made by Parliament or otherwise. I cannot carry her separate existence farther back than the days of that tyrant, bluff Harry the 8th, who, in the early years of his reign, was an ardent supporter of the papal supremacy, and who only determined to overthrow it when the Pope refused to become subservient to the gratification of his passions. At that period there was no other church in England but the Roman Catholic Church:-the church here was part of the Roman Church. Henry the eighth began, Somerset advanced, and Elizabeth completed the reformation. The nation was separated from the Church of Rome; the supremacy of the Pope rejected, along with many sacraments and doctrines and practices of the Cath- olic Church; and a new set of 'articles' framed, altered, amended, and finally improved, and established by lfw as the creed of the Church of England. Thus there was a disruption of old ties, an overthrowing of old systems, and 6"' , +              ,  ,l   WILLITOFT, OR THE the formation of a new one. The new church rejected the authority of the old, and abandoned many of its doctrines as corrupt. Then, this movement-this reformation-was either a heresy and schism, or it was a renewal of the an- cient purity of the faith, which had grown corrupt in the possession of the Church of Rome, and had been accepted and believed, thus false and corrupt, by the whole Christian world. And this involves the great question, whether the church founded by Christ, which the Holy Ghost was to teach all truth-with which the Saviour was to remain all days unto the end,-and against which the gates of hell should never prevail, could fall into error,-could become corrupt. It reduces itself to the question of questions, swallowing all others,-The Infallibility of the Catholic Church. An inquiry like this is not the work of a single moment-it requires long, patient aEnd investigating study " He arose, and in deep thought paced the floor for some time, and at length cast himself upon his bed with the re- solution of prosecuting his inquiries on the morrow, with every facility he could obtain to assist his progress. His mind was calm ~ it had become accustomed to its new sensations; and sleep descended on his pillow, closing his weary eyes, and giving up his mind and body to the repose they so much needed. George Scott, gay, thoughtless and cheerful, disturbed by neither care nor sorrow, slept soundly the sleep of light hearted youth. Roused by the matin song of the summer lark, who, poised in mid air, warbled forth his sweet full notes, he bounded from his couch to seek the fresh breath of morning. Descending to the hall, he strode forth upon one of the many walks, that wound amid beds of aromatic flowers, sweet scented shrubs, and luxuriant evergreens. As he sauntered on, rejoicing in the fragrant air, to hi*   DAYS OF JAMES 1.           67   surprise on entering another path, he found Julia Travers before him, bending over a bed of flowers. "Good-morrow, my fair friend, you are early! I thought even now, that I had been the first to shake off the charms i of slumber.'^ "God keep thee, kinsman," she replied smilingly to his salutation. "I am not much earlier than my wont: for I love to rise with the lark to shake the diamond dew drops from the spray, and to watch my opening flowers. I have come hither to see whether my favorites have been broken or destroyed by last night's storm." "And they are safe, I hope." "Truly, all but one,-a tender flower-and it is bent and drooping. I fear the mid-day's sun will wither it." "Perhaps my skill may save it," he replied, and support- ing it by a twig, he slightly shaded it with a branch of ever- green from the rays of the sun, which was now springing rapidly up the horizon. This done, the youthful friends resumed the walk along the gravelled ways. "Methinks that your poor flower is not the only gentle one that suffered during last night's storm," said George Scott, gaily. "Thou wert wondrously alarmed, Julia."  w "In good truth, I was, George. It is too serious an affair to speak of jestingly. Our lives and liberty were at stake." "I know it-and do you think that I would not risk mine with them ? I shall ever be the foe of cruelty and oppres- sion, come under what guise they may." "I doubt it not, nor did I mean reproach to you: for had I not known before, that you were too generous to forsake your friends in danger, your noble conduct in our behalf last night, would have satisfied me, and made me grateful to you for ever."  68        WILLtTOPTF OR THU "Nay! now you overrate my merits: I had been false to the affection existing between our families, and our own friendship, to have done otherwise." Thus they strolled together in innocent converse) with thoughts as pure and fragrant as the perfume of the flowers, floating on the breath of the morning, whose exhilarating freshness they inhaled. How lovely is the affection of such hearts! Calm, serene, and beautiful;-untainted by the delusions of excited imaginations;-uncorrupted by the selfishness of passion. Mild and pure, the ray of such a light is constant and lasting;-it shines on undimmed amid darkness and sorrow, where passion, the bane of man, the curse of woman, would quickly perish. When they returned to the house from their delightful walk, they found Mr. Travers and William Scott awaiting their coming. The' latter was pale, and bore upon his cheeks the marks of harassing thought and unrefreshing sleep. Father Tichbourne had not yet made his appear- ance; but in that house no question was ever made of his absence or presence, and, without further delay, the party adjourned to the breakfast room. The meal passed in silence, for the cloud which seemed to rest upon the fea- tures, of the elder Scott, cast a gloom upon them all: nor was it possible for them to fathom its cause. His mind seemed occupied; he scarcely tasted the food before him, and shortly after the repast was concluded, he proposed to his brother to return home. Their horses were accordingly brought to the' door, and the brothers, having bid adieu to the inmates of Willitoft with a promise to repeat their visit very soon, set off at a brisk pace down the gravelled carriage way. As they approached toward the gate, the eye of William Scott wandering anxiously to either side, fell upon the form of a man walking leisurely under a dis-   DAYS OF JAMES I.       69 tant group of oaks, as if for the double purpose of exercise and meditation. He reined his horse up for a moment and then bidding his brother to await'his return, dashed rapidly across the grounds and gained the side of Father Tich-  bourne. "I have intruded a second time upon your privacy," he said, bowing gravely. "I hope you will pardon me. I have thought much upon your words and more upon your deeds. Will you permit me to see you again, and con- verse with you at length?" "I shall be most happy," replied Father Tichbourne, gently--" to gratify any wish of yours, Sir, that may be for the good of either. I am grateful for your kind forbear- ance, and shall treasure it in my heart." "Then we shall meet soon again. Shall I find you here?" "You shall: for I will confide in your honor and good faith." "Adieu, then, until we meet again," exclaimed William Scott, abruptly, and spurring his horse, he rejoined his bro- ther, who had watched his proceedings with astonishment mingled with doubt. "Adieu," said Father Tichbourne, as he looked after the departing horseman, "and may God in his mercy, open your eyes to the true faith, and bestow upon you the grace to embrace it!" After the two young men had pursued their ride for some time, the younger addressed his brother: "William, you are strangely altered since yesterday. You were always grave, now you are sombre and unhappy. I fear that the events of the last night have made a wrong impression upon your mind." "They have certainly made a deep impression, George."   70   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES T. "These are cruel laws of ours!"--resumed the young man, determined to fathom his brother's thoughts." "They are, indeed, most cruel." "Do, you speak candidly, William? Surely you are won- drously changed:-or do you deceive me with a feigned acquiescence?" "I have spoken sincerely, George," replied his brother, in some surprise, for wrapt up in his own meditations, he had answered abstractedly; "I am indeed sincere; but my thoughts are busied on myself, and that too sadly.--I pray you, my brother, question me no farther." -s -  ,    CHAPTER V.

HATEVER success king and parliament may -.   have met with, in their violent measures for crushing the religion which had made Eng. land great, glorious, and free, it is very doubtful whether the people, although they submitted patiently at first, took active part in the cruelties which were the means of secur- ing that end. The loss of their religion and of their liberty were either simultaneous or closely connected together. In vain would a Henry the Eighth, in the days of the bish- ops and steel-clad barons and sturdy yeomanry of Runny- mede, have essayed to force schism and heresy on his people. Their hearts were true and faithful to their Church and to their God; and their hands knew how to maintain their rights and liberties. Their descendants corrupted in mannerS, were broken to the chain by the strong will of the tyrant, and abandoned their freedom and their faith together. The master, who ground them to the dust, was the persecutor of the Catholic and nonconformist-it is not to be supposed that the mass of the people, therefore, until embittered by the prejudices implanted in the growing ge. nerations, entered heartily into these schemes of oppres- sion. Even while the laws were most cruel, there were found many to sympathize, and a few to protect and assist;   72        WILLITOtT, OR THE -and the excessive barbarity of many of the penalties en- acted against " aiders and comforters" is a sufficient proof of the difficulty of preventing this feeling. Had the system of the State Church been supported by the people, and those sanguinary laws received the undivided approval and co-operation of Protestants in their execution, the Catho- lics must have been completely exterminated or driven into exile. It was necessary to have recourse to the wildest stories, and the most exaggerated plots, to manufacture an excitement, and then the people, roused to frenzy by their fears, became the willing instruments of designing men. Bigots there were, and knaves;-right honest fools these first, and very knaves these last-who lent themselves with heart and hand to carry through the accursed schemes. Bigots, who thought that thus they best might 'serve the good and merciful God-there have been such in all ages, and all nations ;-and knaves, who knew that they might thus serve well their own advantage. Fit tools were never wanting to gratify the frenzy of the one, or the malice and cupidity of the other. The pursuivants and their companions retraced their steps through the heavy roads and pelting storm, until they were safely housed in the ale-house of the neighboring vil- lage of Underwood. Calling for some hot liquors to warm them, they retired to an inner room, while their followers, inhabitants of the village, betook themselves to their homes. "A bad night's work, this!" said Foxly savagely--"We have been fooled." "True-but we shall yet succeed," replied his compa- nion. "Yet! hum-but what shall I say to Sir Henry -" "Hist!-the less we say of that, now, the better.-My advice is that we leave these parts for the present, and thus   DAYS OF JAMES I.        73 throw them off their guard, and then come down on them suddenly with our ' Captain.' If they escape him,--who never missed a priest yet when he once got on his trail,- why, I say, they ought to go clear and safe."  "Not so bad, either," replied Foxly. "I am inclined to agree with you-and as it is late, let us turn in for an hour's sleep, and be up and away before the dawning." Before the sun arose, the two baffled pursuivants, now most dangerous because thoroughly bent upon their prey, were on their way to join their chief in London. When the two Scotts reached home, they communicated to their father the search at Willitoft and its result. George was the speaker, for his elder brother was silent and reserv- ed; and the young man, with more prudent consideration than might have been expected from his careless disposi- tion, passed over untold those circumstances of suspicion, the knowledge of which might have placed his father in an unpleasant position ts a justice of the peace. In the midst of the conversation, William Scott left the room and strolled out upon the green, pensively seeking the shade of the clumps of old oaks, that ornamented-the grounds. The gentle murmurs of the breeze amid their foliage, and the tender gloom of their shadows suited well the state of his mind. The eye of a mother is keen in perception, and her heart quick in comprehension :-she divines instinct- ively the feelings of her child. The altered demeanor of her eldest son had not escaped the observant eyes of Mrs. Scott, and she hastened to join him in his retreat. "Well, William," she said, cautiously sounding him, "how liked you your former playmate, Julia Travers? Think you she hath improved since last you saw her?" "Yes-no-pardon me, mother," he replied, recovering from his abstraction in some confusion. "I confess I did 7   74       WILL1TOFT, OR THE not observe her very attentively. Now that I reflect-my impression is that she is somewhat improved." "It is not that"-she said mentally, in answer to her own supposition: and addressing her son,- she added ten- derly: "I fear you occupy your mind too much with study and meditation, William. You should have more care of your health. Let me entreat you to dismiss these harassing mental occupations, while you are with us, and recreate yourself a little." "Dear mother, there are subjects of study which we can- not dismiss from our minds when we would, which we dare not if we could." ("And what are they, my son?" He paused for a moment, wavering in his purpose to reveal his doubts to her,-but said at length, "Nay, spare me, mother, I cannot answer you fully now.-Do you not think these English laws of ours very cruel that punish men for conscience' sake and persecute them for differ- ences of faith?" "Why, William, I have often heard you dwell upon the justice and the charity of using paternal force to compel the stray and wandering children of the Church to turn their steps back into the true path'!" "I did? Ah most true! I had forgotten. Well, it is strange: men's notions and opinions are mere bubbles, breath of air, with unsubstantial gaudiness of coloring cast around them. They swell, and glow, and break-ten thou- sand in a day. Man keeps no record of them. They are foundlings of the brain,--once cast off, forgotten, and their parent claims no kindred with them. Can it be, that on such fleeting, changing basis rests man's salvation? On mere opinion? On wpavering inconsistent mind, swayed by its own hopes and fears, its pride and prejudice? Alas,   DAYS OF JAMES I.        75 it is a fearful thing, this doubt! Almost better disbelief than doubt-than the agony of uncertainty!" Surprised and stunned, like her of olden myth, stricken, sorrowing, as it were to stone, the mother stood and gazed upon her son. The broken sentences that escaped his lips, conveyed to her not half the meaning that occupied his mind. The. subject of his thoughts, struggling for utter- ance, at the first allusion, came forth in words inconpre- hensible to her, who dreamed not of the inward struggle. The flash of mental excitement awakened in his eye, seem- ed to the anxious mother to be the first flickering gleam of insanity; and his contracted brow, and earnest manner, struck a chill to her very heart. "William! William! talk not thus, for heaven's sake!" she exclaimed, "be composed! You have over-wrought your excitable feelings -faculties! Give nature some re- pose! Doubt? Good heaven! I know not what you mean!" "Thank God, you do not! and pray heaven I may not, mother. But look on me. Seem I as one over-wrought, carried away? Excited I may be, and roused; and every fa- culty strained to its duty; for the thought that fills my mind is great and awful. Life, Death, God, Eternity, are embraced in the contemplation-and Salvation is the issue. Reli- gion, revealed religion-its very revelation incomprehensi- ble! Oh, my mother, it is fearfully distracting, fill of food for thought and ceaseless study, and worthy of it." "My son, what is it that has cast adrift that well balanced mind? How is it that you have become the prey of such wild thoughts? These are but distempered fancies!" "Do not think so. Yet, would that they were-any thing but what they are." "Dismiss them from your mind, I pray you, William; by a mother's right I ask it. Believe me, they are but the dis-   76        WILLITOFT, OR THE ordered fancies that rise up to tempt and to disturb the over-tasked mind. Dismiss them now; and, soon, active exercise, and robust health, will solve all your doubts and calm your fears!" A smile passed over the features of the young man, as the mother's voice soothed him and won him from his anxious mood; and bending down, he kissed her hand affectionately. It thrilled to that mother's heart like the whispered voice of hope, telling of safety found and dan- ger passed. But the feeling of joy was only short-lived;- it fled, as her son, in a calm, firm voice and with collected manner, replied: "Dear mother, at your command, IJwill dismiss these thoughts from my mind; but sooner or later, I feel that I must probe them to the bottom. It is impossible to hush the voice that, in soft low tones, seems ever urging them upon me. I have not told you all that has been passing in my mind-perhaps 'twere better not!-Let it rest where it is." "Yes, William, let it rest there never more to be disturb- ed from its place of repose. Lef us return!" The mother and son retraced their steps to the house, and were met at the door by Mr. Scott, who was about to ride out. i Well, this is a strange freak of my brothers of the com- mission-is it not? Travers' house has been searched for hidden priests, and images, and all those forbidden knick- knacks, which our popish friends will deal in. I really cannot conceive what pleasure or profit these men can find in thus annoying peaceable neighbors." "Duty! perhaps!" said William Scott in a very signifi- cant tone. His father looked at him a moment doubtfully and then passed on.   DAYS OF JAMES I.        " Quitting his mother, William Scott ascended to his room and gave himself up to meditation. A shelf of books was suspended against the walls in that old style, now begin- ing to be revived again, by means of which a few sterling standard books are always within reach. Upon a table lay the Book of Common Prayer: he took it up and sought within its pages for peace and consolation. Yet even as he read, the racking thoughts, which had so lately filled his mind, came rushing over him, until he found himself una- ble to pray without distraction. He closed the book again, and gave himself up to thought. The very authority of the book itself went to his heart and struck forth new doubts- sent forth by act of parliament, its use compelled, the ob- servance of its forms enforced by penalties, the Articles of belief which it contained declared orthodox by law. The framers of its creed seeme'd to have relied on and secured all of human authority without reference to that super-hu- man and divine authority on which a solemn declaration of faith should rest firm and immoveable. It was the work of man; and upon the fieans which the power of man could provide were based the hopes of its endurance and the prospects of its success. Therefore, when the opinions of those in power had changed, this auth(oitative exposition of what was truth, was changed to suit khe new opinions. But was not truth unchangeable? was it not eternal as God? immoveable from its fast anchor at the throne of the Most High? ever beautiful and ever the same? If, then, that which was called truth varied and changed; if it was driven about by every wind of doctrine, and yet in all its changes equally enforced by the same power, equally aithenticated in all its phases by the same sanctions,-it must necessa- rily be false: the source from which it sprung could not be 3*   78       WILLITOFT, OR THE a pure and lawful source; nor the authority which enforced it a proper and inspired authority. "The heaven-guided guardian of Truth can never be- come the promulgator and protector of falsehood; and falsehood is the only thing that varies and changes. But, perhaps, in these changes and variations, no matters of faith were altered or affected; perhaps, I amn permitting my doubts to run away Kwith my wisdom, and induce the innate skepticism of my nature to take for granted the assertions of the enemies of our church. Be it as it may, I will again seek this Jesuit, or whatsoever he may be, and hear from his own lips the full claim of his church to orthodoxy, in order that I may place it side by side with the arguments in behalf of my own, and compare and judge between. God grant me a safe deliverance!" As he concluded this mental soliloq uy, he again opened the Book of Common Prayer with no definite intention- his eye fell upon the Psalm "Judica me, Deus! et discerne causam meam." Its appropriateness to his present thoughts struck forcibly upon his mind, and, grateful to the Provi- dence which seemed to have brought the words of inspired prayer to his lips, he exclaimed: "Give sentence with me, O God, and defend my cause against the ungodly people: O deliver me from the deceit- ful and wicked man. "For thou art the God of my strength! Why hast thou put me from thee? 'and why go I so heavily while the ene- my oppresseth me? "Oh send out thy light and thy truth that they may lead me, and bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy dwelling, "And that I may go unto the altar of God; even unto the God of my joy and gladness: and upon the harp will, I give thanks unto thee, O God, my God.   DAYS OF JAMES I.       798: "Why art thou so heavy, oh my soul? and why art thou so disquieted within me? "Oh put thy trust in God, for I will yet give him thanks which is the help of my countenance and' my God."@ "Oh, put thy trust in God!" he repeated as he descend- ed from his chamber, and again sought the companionship of his friends. He had resolved to seek out Father Tichbourne on the following morning, and by his aid to carry into execution the design he had formed of making a fill and thorough examination into the subject that now weighed upon his mind. v Man proposes but God disposes. The long bright evening of summer- had already begun to wane around the family circle of Mr. Scott, while the admiring parents were enjoying the merry sallies of George, and occasionally wondering at the evident pre-occupation of William, when a gentleian, followed by a servant, was observed riding leisurely across the lawn towards the door of the mansion. His appearance excited some speculation. Mr. Scott failed to recognize in,the stranger any of his neighbors or his more distant acquaintances; and George was utterly at a loss in searching over his list of friends. "Come, William," he said at length to his brother, who had retained his seat, " tell us who may be this stranger knight approaching our castle, that we may meet him at the threshold with proper greeting. Doubtless he is one of thine acquaintance, for he is unknown to us. Perchance, he is some wandering and benighted traveller who seeks our hospitality." William Scott arose and approached the window. At the first glance his eye kindled up, and he said in a cheer- ful tone: * Protestant Version. \ Book of Common Prayer.   80        WILLITOFT, OR THE "You are right! it is my friend, my college friend, young Alton." The gentlemen reached the door, just as the visitor reined in his horse. "Well, Alton, I am delighted to see you," said William Scott, as he cordially shook his hand, after introducing him to his father and brother. "I am really happy that you have had the courage to penetrate into these retired fast- nesses of ours-you who rejoice in the gay pleasures of the city." "I am come to try the wild joys of rural life, which you have so often and so poetically pictured to me. Every body is out of town, and it occurred to me that it would be ex- ceedingly pleasant to run down and surprise you in the country-and here I am." "( And most happy are we that your charity extended itself to us and gave us your gay company in our dull solitude!" Henry Alton was a college acquaintance of the elder Scott, very different in character and disposition, yet warmly attached to him. He possessed little of that fervor or depth of feeling which marked the disposition of William Scott; nor was his mind of that religious and meditative turn. True,he had, at one period, given himself up with some zeal to studies which partook of a religious cast, but the spirit of inqui y was not ardent enough to secure perseve- rance; and he became, at first, listless and indifferent, and, then, somewhat of a Freethinker. Nothing of this entered into the mind of William Scott as he pressed his friend's hand and presented him to his mother. Alton was soon domiciled with them; but several days elapsed before the turn of his mind displayed itself. His gay and cheerful spirit, and his suavity of manner soon won the heart of George Scott; and both, lively, and con-   DAYS OF JAMES I.        81 stantly engaged in filling up every hour with new amuse- ments or pleasant occupations shared by Mr. and Mrs. Scott, led the heart of the elder brother captive and diverted for a time the course of serious meditation on which he had entered. Mrs. Scott observed this change with heartfelt pleasure; and secretly blessed the sudden appearance of Alton in their midst as a providential interference in behalf of her agitated son. She entered heartily into all their plans and amusements, hoping that agreeable occupation would calm his mind and restore it to its wonted tranquil- lity. She took care that it should be necessary for William to bear a principal part in all their schemes for the common entertainment: he was the leader of every excursion, the reader of every poem that was to be recited, the sketcher of every beautiful point of landscape view, which in their daily rides struck her fancy as appropriate for her portfolio, of-neighboring scenery. Thus she succeeded in filling up each portion of his time so pleasantly-it was pleasant to fulfil the wishes of a mother, to win approving smiles of affection from the lips that had spoken kind words to him in infancy, to repay with dutiful love her who had cherished him-that by degrees he was beguiled from the harassing thoughts which had filled his soul. He became daily more cheerful, and more unreserved. The occasional fits of af- sence of mind disappeared: his brow cleared-and his na- ture seemed to partake even of the light and joyous dispo- sitions of his brother and his friend. The mother's fond heart began to swell with triumph. William Scott, although he kept constantly in his mind the resolution, which he had made to see Father Tichbourne, felt each day less anxiety concerning its execution, and, as he became more and more occupied with their daily diver- sions, reverted less frequently to the subject connected with   82        WILLTTOFT, OR THE that resolution. So true it is, that, at the very moment in which some firm determination is made, some pious reso- lution adopted, the arch-fiend is ready by the surest and most secret means, wielding even the holiest and best affec- tions to his purpose, to bind the chains still stronger around his victims. Thus it was with William Scott. No sooner had he resolved to search out the truth, and follow it if he found it, than new trials and temptations-trials concealed under wreaths of flowers, temptations in the guise of virtue, stealing the garb of filial love and duty-beset him to lure him from his onward path. Such snares but few effectually resist. It is only a rare providence that breaks the chain and restores the victim to freedom. One morning the three young men mounted their horses for a ride; and, as they paced along, admiring the beautiful views which every turn of the road presented to them, they descanted on the endless variety of nature and her pure beauties which so deeply fascinate the contemplative ob- server. The conversation, from a poetical and descriptive cast, at length, took a graver tone, as William Scott ex- claimed: "How beautiful it is, thus, through nature to look up to nature's God! to read the lessons of Almighty wisdom in the wild leaves of nature's ever operrbook! to admire what is beyond our comprehension! Here, in the forest, amid the mighty old oaks swinging their gnarled arms, and shrouded in their canopy of deep and sombre foliage, with their vast trunks black with the winds and rains and snows of centuries, while the eye looks up, through the leafy arches, up, up, towards the blue heavens, piercing the boundless space till the brain grows dizzy with the thought, -here man feels his own littleness, his own inferiority, his own- mortality. He feels irresistibly, that there is One,   DAYS OF JAMES 1.       83 greater and more powerful, omnipotent, and bows down in humble submission!" -Alton reined in his horse for a moment, and looked in- credulously at the speaker: then with a smile he exclaimed, as he again spurred on, "The scenery is very grand, and very beautiful, no doubt; and, poetically speaking, may produce all the effects you have described. But for me, such poetical feelings have ceased to be very fascinating. When you talked of the old oaks, I thought of an axe, and how the hand of man guided by his wondrous soul, could shape from them the means of conquering and subduing nature, the sea, the earth, the air. When you spoke of the blue void, 1 remembered the hu- man power that knew how to fathom its depths, and with the wondrous instrument to measure and to weigh the hitherto invisible stars above us. My dear friend, there is little that we may not understand! Behold the brilliancy of science and learning in this our glorious age of enlight- enment, in comparison to which the learning of the past is darkness, and hope with me that the time shall come when the human mind shall become perfect and embrace all knowledge. As for me, what I cannot comprehend, I shall doubt; and doubting, search until I understand or disbelieve." "Disbelieve!" said William Scott, in surprise. "Surely you do not mean to extend that doctrine to matters of Re- ligion,-of Faith? of Revelation?" "Nay, now, William, you are too hard upon me! But doubtless, in religion, too, if we believe what we do not understand, we will run the risk of believing a vast quan- tity of absurdity and falsehood. Why, my dear fellow, can you imagine a just and wise God, who has given man rea- son for his guide, requiring man to believe that which is   A :s4      WILLITOFT, OR THE inconsistent with reason? Surely suchi would not be the act of a Supreme -Intelligence. Why hive we been gifted with reason,. above the brutes? because we have souls, above the brutes, to be saved; and- reason is to guide-that soul in the path of salvation. If God be the perfection of' Reason, all his works and words, all his Revelation, must be infinitely reasonable. The Reason of man-whose mind has been formed from the breath of God and in His Image -must be able to understand and grasp that which is irnfi- nitely, and therefore palpably reasonable. What we, find unreasonable-contrary to, Reason-we are compelled to doubt as wanting the stamp of Omniscient Wisdom,--as absurd, and contrary to the teachings of the guide which the Deity has given us. We may justly suspect it to be the fabrication: of Nan." The fallacies of Alton's positions were at once evident to the clear and logical mind of William Scott; but shocked at the impious blow which seenled aimed at all the myste- ries of Revelation, at Revelation itself, and forgetful of his own recent doubts, he was for a moment unable to reply. Alton looked upon him with triumph, while his younger brother watched the play of his features with anxiety, con- scious of his skill in argument, and yet feating that an un- answerable- argument had been advanced. ' But, very soon, the expression of surprise faded!rom the countenance of William Scott, and was succeeded by one of deep sorrow, as he replied: "Alton, Alton, you surprise me. What have you to do with doubt or -disbelief," he added; as the recollection of the declaration, which- had so shocked his mother, flashed across his mind, bringing back vividly the memory of that interior struggle, which seemed already to have ceased, and the idea of combatting his friend's wild opinions was at   DAYS OF JAMES I.        85 once forgotten. "Where have you learned incredulity and how? What has disturbed the still waters of your soul?" "The sluggish waters, you would say, Scott; sluggish, dark, motionless-never rippling with the breath of thought, nor breaking into the bright and sparkling waves of free inquiry! Aye, you said rightly; the mind that rests un- moved under the shadow of authority is still, dull, inert- like the lifeless pool unfanned by the living breeze. Give me the wild, free waters, boundless and unchained, that sparkle bright and clear; and, even when they lash them- selves to anger, roll and dash them where they list--' "Aye, upon the rocks, good Alton, where the soul that seeks this licentious freedom and boasts its infidelity as light and wisdom, must wreck its dearest hopes, its everlasting happiness. And when they lash and roar, destroying the strong and beautiful, whose mandate bids them ' cease, be still ' whose finger marks the limit which they cannot pass?" "Well, now, old friend, you are logical! The waves cease their fury when the winds that lashed them die away to calm. Nature stirs up her storms, and nature, that is the laws of things, restores the elements to repose again." "And who proclaimed those laws?" "God! God did all this: but having given the earth and nature, with her laws, to man, think you that he, the Al- mighty, the Infinite, will busy himself with the petty things of earth, the trifles which man calls good or evil? Think you that having laid down the law which all created things must follow, that he will watch for obedience from things and beings that cannot disobey"? that he will stoop to turn aside disease and death for a passing moment from ithe ani- mated particle of dust called man-one little being among myriads such? The river flows continuous to the sea, what matter that rocks and jutting headlands throw back its cur- 8   86       WILLITOFT, OR THE rent into momentary eddies; its waters still flow on, obey- ing nature's law, and thus with man." "Aye will he heed! He has said that not even the spar- row's fall is unmarked by him. Alton, Alton for the sake of your immortal soul, pause on the brink, of the precipice on which you totter-hurled thence, who will arrest your fall and raise you up? Surely you have too much respect J for the inspired Word to assert such doctrines earnestly!" "In most sad and sober earnestness. I tell you I can- not accept as revealed truth that which is contrary to my reason. God cannot be the author of it-it is the work of man. You find it in the Bible? It may be an interpolation of the dark ages, or a mistranslation, or I know not what. This I do know, God cannot be the author of a contra- diction!" "But, Alton, we have the authority of our church for the authenticity of the Scriptures, and for the truth of many incomprehensible dogmas of faith which we are command- ed by her to believe-"                 "True, most true!" exclaimed Alton, with a cynic smile -"true! Authority! If authority be the guiding star that is to outshine the light of reason,-talk not to me of Church of England authority. Why, Scott, if Authority had been the rule of our fathers, we never would have had this new church of ours. It will not do for us to claim authority, before the sound of our protest against authority has died away to its latest echo. If we take this guide, let us follow it back at once and embrace again the errors and corrup- tions of the Church of Rome. No, no, Scott, it is not our rule, not our true path. Reason, the light which God has given us, must be our guide; and the reason of each man for himself. It was given him to guide him, and by it alone must he be guided. You might as well talk to the chained   DAYS OF JAMES I.        87 slave of liberty, while the iron is rusting in his flesh. No, ng, Scott! Authority is an idleiword to me!' "Alas! is this the fatal tendency of the glorious Refor- mation?" sighed William Scott. "Infidelity! for nothing less is this pretended liberty of thought and belief." And then he remained silent for a few minutes, while he ran over in memory the scenes at Willitoft, the deep, heartfelt faith of the priest, firm and Unyielding with the faggot al- most before his eyes, with the officers of the law in pursuit of him-, and the storm raging around him. Then came up again the crowd of doubts and fears that had filled his mind during the restless night he spent at the mansion of his friend, crowned as it were with the pregnant sneer of his freethinking friend at the authority of the Church of Eng- land, and the inconsistency of her claim to rule men's con- sciences, while she herself rejected the authority of that church which had, even according to the admission of her founders, exercised universal authority in spiritual affairs for a thousand years. Repressing this train of thought with an effort, he replied to his friend: "Surely, Alton, it is scarcely necessary for me to point out to you the fallacy in your argument. You are a logi- cian, and must know that the terms, 'above reason' and 'contrary to reason' are not synonymous. The mystic union of soul and body may be above reason-surely it is not contrary to our reason. We do not understand how it is-but we believe it---and this on the evidence of our senses--our consciousness. Why shall we refiuse to believe other things, which we cannot understand, when the autho- rity for believing themsis no less than the word of God? A fact-or- doctrine may be' above reaso'n,; without beiihg co6n trary to reason. It may be inexplicable and yet no contra- diction. You have fallen into a sad confusion of terms.   88        WILLITOFT, OR THE Whether is it more consistent with reason that we should accept the revealed word of an all-wise, and an all-true God, without hesitation, or that we should strive to bring down the infinity of his wisdom and measure it by our finite wisdom? You say God is infinitely reasonable-admit the term to be applied correctly for the sake of argument-- does it not necessarily follow that infinite reason can never be grasped by finite reason? Can Time embrace Eternity? the smaller include the greater? And yet such is the effect of your argument. Oh, Alton, we cannot comprehend Eternity; and yet eternity exists; we cannot comprehend ourselves, and yet we live and breathe: we cannot com- prehend our God, the Infinite All-wise, and yet we believe in him and love him, and therefore we must believe in what he has taught us, even be it beyond the scope of our narrow minds to grasp and understand it. If he is infin- itely great, he is also as good and as merciful: and his goodness and mercy must make him solicitous for his crea- tures. His wisdom is above our wisdom-His justice above our justice: and it is, at least, the wildest folly to scrutinize the motives of the Omnipotent. Once satisfied that he has revealed a truth, no matter how incomprehensible it may be to us, we niust receive it and believe it." "Aye, Scott," said Alton solemnly after a moment's pause--"But God has revealed nothing to me; and how, when mortal man like to myself, and, perchance no better, bids me believe this dogma and that creed, as the word of God, how am I to know he bears a true revelation? What is there to tell me that it is of God and that he carries the commission of God? If I am to believe upon the authority of God, that which my reason cannot understand, I must be assured by nothing less than that authority-itself, that such are the words of God: otherwise I am believing -   DAYS OF JAMES I.        89. on the word of man. You perceive here an impossibility for us. Whence this Authority? for God himself does not speak to us, as he did to the Jews of old." "He speaks to us through the Church," replied Scott, triumphantly, " the Church which is the depositary and the witness of his word; and it is on her teaching and her au- thority that we must rely." "But, my dear fellow, if you insist upon the authority of the Church, what becomes of the great triumph of the Reformation, which was based upon resistance to the then, sole existent spiritual authority, the then depositary and witness of the truth? Surely your argument proves too much for you--for it proves you to be a rebel and a heretic. What becomes, too, of the mighty principle evolved from so much struggle and difficulty, the principle of free inqui- ry, which burst asunder the bonds that had so long tram- melled the reason of man and made him the slave of super- stition. Better be the slave of the old master who ruled it lightly, if a slave at all."     / "There you are wrong, Alton! No one is a slave, nor is his reason trammelled who follows truth. What the Church proclaims is truth. Now when the Church insists that this shall be received and believed, it merely does that which right reason does, but which reason does not always. do;--that is, insists that the known truth shall be believed. In following the teachings of the Church, we are following and receiving truth, and therefore reason is not constrained; for of itself it could only at best arrive at truth, could only follow in that path, which the authority of the Church has already marked out; without the aid of which, from pride of intellect, it too often goes astray." "My dear Scott, you argue wondrous well in behalf of this doctrine; and yet methinks that your positions are not 8*   90        WILLITOFT, OR THE new. I have seen the same remarks in some old papistical book, defending the authority of the Church of Rome, and; against the rebellion of the English Church."!' "Perhaps so," said Scott, and became silent. The sub- ject was discussed no more. As he reviewed the course of the conversation, William Scott felt a severe pang of regret that he had postponed so' long the examination of a subject the most important that could engage the attention of man. Not only did all his former doubts revive and present themselves to his mind with renewed force, but others, perhaps more annoying be- cause excited by the arguments of his friend whose incre- dulity he sought .to convinceWstarted up before his discern- ing' judgment demanding examination and solution, or threatening to strike deep at the roots of his faith, and to  cast him forth reckless and almost unbelieving, like him whose disbelief he still felt compelled to despise, Occu- pied with these thoughts, he did not endeavor to renew the conversation; and Alton readily acquiesced in his silent de- termination, little anxious to revive a controversy in which he had won no honor, and which seemed to produce so unpleasant an effect upon his opponent. Insensibly, the elder Scott fell behind his companions, who soon became engaged in light and cheerful conversa- tion, leaving him to pursue the graver course of speculation that filled his mind. In the course of their ride, the party had accidentally turned their horses' heads towards Willi- toft, and William Scott now found himself alone, in the rear of his companions, and but a short distance from the gates of that secluded mansion. A shady lane struck off from the road they had been pursuing, and led to it across the country. He paused for a moment, in hesitation at its entrance, and -then exclaiming, "Aye, I will seek him now," spurred down the solitary path. A few minutes rapid ride   DAYS OF JAMES I.       91 brought him to the park, and as the heavy gates swung be- hind him, he paced more leisurely to the door. Mr. Travers was absent, but his sister received him kindly, while the fair Julia met him with a smile of joyous and tran- quil innocence that broke like a gladdening sun-beam into the dark recesses of his soul, and gave-him fresh and more cheerful courage to proceed upon his mission. The aunt arose to leave the room for a moment, and as she closed the door, William Scott perceived by her empty chair, a string of beads which had fallen there unnoticed. He stepped for- ward and taking them from the floor presented them to Julia. "They are my aunt's," she said very calmly as she re- ceived them. "We were saying our morning Chaplet of the Rosary." "I honor your devotion, Julia, would it were better directed." "And could devotion be better directed than that to the Mother of God, next to her Divine Son, most worthy of honor and love?" "Yes! to her Divine Son himself!" "My friend, the honor which we pay to Blessed Mary, ever virgin, would be no honor to her Divine Son.-It would be to give to the Creator the inferior honor which we may justly give to the creature." p "But you ask her intercession'! What evidence have you that she hears you?" "' The Church teaches us, and we hear the Church!" "Yes," thought William Scott, "that is the true and only ' issue, after all. If the Catholic Church be the true church what she teaches must be true: a true church cannot teach false doctrines." He did not reply to the observation of Miss Travers, but remained silent for many minutes. Julia watched his coun-. tenance with anxiety, doubtful of the effect which this little   92   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I. incident might produce upon his mind; but every feeling of hesitation passed away, as he approached her and in a lower tone than he had hitherto used addressed her, "My dear friend, at least, it -seems to me that your prayers must be innocent; as innocent as prayers for the intercession of any other of God's creatures. Your Church teaches you the invocation of Saints and Angels. If they can hear us, methinks it is easy to believe that their love will extend itself to us, and that their charity will induce them--pure, perfect, rejoicing before the face of God--to advocate before his throne the welfare of those on earth who solicit their intercession. Pray for me, my friend!" 1   c "Oh, I will, I will; that God may open your eyes and soften your heart to truth, and lead your footsteps into the fold of the true Church," she exclaimed; as a tear of joy- ous surprise glistened in her eye. "Where is your venerable tutor, the priest? I have come hither to seek him and would see him. His calmness in difficulty, his charity and amiability have stolen upon me,. and I love to converse with him." "Oh, yes, he is pious and charitable and kind-hearted," she said, " and we love him too. He is still here. On the morning after the annoying visit of the pursuivant, when Father Tichbourne was preparing to seek safety in another shire, we learned that the intruders had left the neighbor- hood, and thus relieved from all fear of danger- he remained. He is even now in the library. I need not point the way to you," she added with a smile. "No, Julia, if I had been ignorant of it before, the cir- cumstances of-mv last visit would have impressed it indeli- bly on my memory," he replied, and departed for the libra-. ry, while Julia resumed with new fervor the rosary, which his entrance had interrupted, -mindful of his request in every aspiration of her pure heart.   "I CHAPTER      VI. "Still doth that spirit linger upon earth ;, Still the vain doubt has, in delusion, birth. We hesitate, we cavil, we deny, And ask tihough all things answer in reply; All nature echoes with one mighty yes, And only man will not his God confess."--L. E. L. (B,^'ATHER Tichbourne was deeply immersed in the pages of a musty looking folio, which rested on A d  a stand before him, when William Scott entered the library. Rising up, he met him at the door; and taking his hand, kindly and courteously led him to a seat besiade his own. "I have come," said the young man, "in pursuance of' my promise; but it has slumbered long in my breast, longer than I could have wished." "The examination after the truth is an important affair,. and, as salvation may depend upon the issue, it behooves one- to be prompt and unhesitating," said Father Tichbourne.  "You are certainly right," replied William Scott, " and for that reason, without further preliminary, I will ask you to state again, clearly and explicitly, the doctrine of your Church, with regard to its authority. I conceive that point to be an essential one in the examination." "So essential is it," said Father Tichbourne, "that the dogma of the Authority of the Church once established and admitted, as I have already stated, the whole doctrine which that church teaches must also be admitted: for if- she be the true Church, authoritative and infallible in her teaching, it follows that all she teaches must be truth, and   "       WILLITOFT, OR THE be received without inquiry or doubt, for she cannot err. The Church is founded upon a Rock--Peter and his sue-  cessors-Peter to whom Christ said, 'I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not: and thou being once converted, confirm thy brethren'--Peter, who was called the First of the Apostles.* . Peter, who was appointed Chief Pastor of Flocks, and to whose care were given the Shepherds and the Sheep. On this rock was founded this Church, which/ Christ promised should not fail; which he declared he would 'be with all days unto the end,' over which, ' the Gates of Hell should never prevail,' to which he was to ' send his Holy Spirit to teach it all truth,' which he com- manded all men to ' hear,' and whose ministers he sent forth with the mandate to preach the Gospel to the whole world anid through all time, so that there,should ' be one fold, and one shepherd.'" "But, my dear Sir, permit me to interrupt you," said Scott. "This seems plausible enough, if we admit the promises of Christ to have been made to the Church as a body, a corporation, so to speak: is it not more scriptural, and more logical to predicate these promises of the Apos- tles and their successors individually? Were they not made to each and every one of them?" "Then, the effect of your suggestion," said Father Tich- bourne, "if it be correct, is to overthrow the doctrine of the Church as a body teaching, distinct and separate from, and superior to the individual teacher." "Most undoubtedly," replied William Scott. "I mean to deny that the Church exists in the form of a body teach- ing infallibly: but I assume the promises of Christ to have : been tnade -to each teaciheir.'l- : - -^; - . .: * "And the names of the twelve apostles are these: the first, Simon who is called Peter," &c.-St. Matt. x, 2.   DAYS OF JAMES I.4       95 "Let us see, resumed Father Tichbourne, "where that position will leave you. Although I contend for the infal- libility of the Church as a body teaching, I will pass it for the moment and follow out the doctrine you have assumed and test its truth. It-will enable me to prove, by one mode, what I should have proved in another--the Infallibility of the Catholic Church as a teaching body. These promises apply either to the individual teachers who compose the Church, or to the body of those teachers as a body. If they do not and cannot apply to the individuals, then they must apply to the body of the Teachers-the Ecclesia docens. And further, I think I can compel you to abandon your position, and adopt mine, and the Church, or retain your position and admit that your church is teaching false doc- trine and must be rejected." An incredulous smile passed over the features of William Scott, but he remained silent while Father Tichbourne pro- ceeded with increased animation. "I first lay it down that Christ cannot be with a false teacher-for remember I am now arguing on the position you have taken of the individual application of the promises of Christ-His Spirit cannot be with him teaching hinm all truth. If Christ is with a Teacher, it must be for the pur- poses of the Teacher, for the promise of his constant pre- sence was made consequent upon the command given to go forth and teach all nations. It was upon this condition and in this capacity, that the apostles and their successors 'to the end' were to be blessed with this presence, this assistance of Cihrist. His Spirit, if with the teacher, must be with him guiding and directing, or there is no presence- at all, no real fulfilment of the promise. But if Christ is with the Teacher for the purpose of his teaching, and the Teacher be a false Teacher and teach error, then Christ is   96        WILLITOFT, OR THE with him, aiding him for the purpose of that teaching, which is error. It is useless to say that part may be true, and part false; for if the whole doctrine assume to be truth, the whole and sole truth, it is a false doctrine, and it is blasphemous to say that the Spirit of God is with a ,teacher for the purpose of teaching falsely. "Besides, he promises that he will send his spirit to them to teach them all truth, and this promise is not con- fined to the Apostles but extends to their successors by the very form of your position. "Further, the Christian Revelation was made to man for his enlightenment and salvation. It was made whole and perfect, and belief in it was made necessary for man's sal- vation. For that which Christ revealed was necessarily and infallibly true, because he was God.. If we refuse to believe any word of his, we deny His Divine truth and de- tract from his honor as much as if we deniedevery word he has uttered. It is as impossible for God to have made a revelation, false or unnecessary in the smallest point, as it is for him to have made a revelation false or unnecessary in the whole. It is necessary for us to believe in Christ, that is, to believe his words, and all his words; and this belief, implicit or explicit, is requisite for salvation; 'I e that believeth not shall be condemned,' and he that refuses belief to Christ in any one point whatever, doth not believe in Christ, and 'will be condemned.' We must believe all that he has commanded; so we must not believe more than he has commanded. For if we believe or teach as articles of faith, as God's word, that which is not God's word, what is no'article of faith, we are teaching and be- -lieving a falsehood, teaching and believing our own fabri- L cations instead of his revelations. And in this we deny  God's divine truth and ' do' not ' believe ' in him.

Son and of the -Hol;yihost,' teaching them to 6bserve all things whatsoever he had commanded them, and -he then made them the so- lemn pledge that he, should- 'be with them all days even to the-consummation of the world." And this pledge was made to the teachers, the Apostles and their successors, that they might teach every creature in the world. As teachers and Apostles, the Holy Spirit -was to be sent to them 'teaching them all truth and abiding in them,' to re- mind them of the things which Jesus had said in life, and to inspire them with that which they were not yet then pre- pared-to hear. Now these promises were made to the teachers, and, according to your supposition, to each- indi- vidual teacher or apostle, and of course to their individual successors. If, therefore, the Spirit of Truth :abides in each teacher, teachipg him all truth, that Teacher must- know the trut-and, having the spirit of truth within him, must preach the truth.

"Thatp is -all very"plain," said William Scott. "It needs no proof.)'   :   -. "Many of your Churchmen deny it, however," replied Father Tichbourne, "'and I did notwish to exact a single concession from uyo."  -  -I S!think it is evident," said Scott, ,' that Christ, the God of Trith, cannot be present with and- inspiring the teacher   DAYS OF JAMBS I. s9 of falseh0ood. To assert it, would be blasphemous. But to what does "this tend?" "( We shall see," replied Father Tichbourne, "as the ar- gument developes itself. Let me, however, make a single quotation from that divinely eloquent prayer which Christ poured forth for those whom he had already delegated to their arduous mission:              ' "'Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is Truth. "' As thou hast sent me into the world I also have sent them into the world. "' And for them do I sanctify myself; that they also may be sanctified in truth. "'And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall believe in me.'* "It is unnecessary to comment upon these words: they show that truth, such as the Saviour's truth, was .to be the test and the mark of the Teachers-of the teacher with whom he was to abide. Again, the Apostle St. Paul, in his second Epistle to the Corinthians, warns them not to listen to false teachers and says, ' If any one preach to you a Gospel besides that which you have received, let him be anathema,' and he asserts that the gospel which he preach- ed is not from man, but from God. And can the Holy Spirit be with one who is anathematized? Can Christ be with the accursed false teacher? "Again, it might be urged that this presence of Christ, this abiding of the Holy Spirit is the simple state of Orders, received and transmitted; and that a Bishop who may be a false teacher, may transmit Orders as well as one who is thoroughly orthodox.". "' I confess that is an objection -which-did not occur to me: yet it seems plausible enough," interposed William Scott. S * St. John xvii, 1i7-20. I    .               a,   1iJO       WILLITOFT, OR THE It has no weight, however," replied Father Tichbourne. "Let us examine only the first part of the position-that these promises refer to the transmission of Orders. The transmission of Orders is simply the conveying the power and authority to preach and to perform the holy offices of the priesthood in its various grades, accompanied with the grace of the sacrament. But the promises of Christ clearly extend to the truth of the teaching and to purity of doc- trine: and if your idea of their individual application be correct, establish individual infallibility in every person t1o whom they are applied by the transmission of orders. For the promise is clear that the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Truth shall abide in them teaching them all truth. They cannot therefore teach or believe false doctrine and are, of neces- sity, infallible. If these promises have reference to orders, every preacher with his ordination and consecration has received infallibility. This position is a double edged sword, for it proves its own falsehood. The Greek bishops, and the Arian bishops, and those whom you claim to be bishops of the Church of England, all teach differently from the bishops of the Church of Rome, and differently from each other in matters of faith, and contradict each other. Therefore they are not all teachers of truth, for truth is one. "This proves that the promises of Christ do not refer to the individual teacher, granting that all these are regular teachers. But if you still insist upon maintaining this po- sition, I will conclude from it the truth and divine Autho- rity and Infallibility of the Catholic Church in two ways; "First. If true, then the teachers of early ages, the bishops who taught, as they universally did down to the ninth or tenth century, at the least, the infallibility of the Church as a teaching body, taught the truth; and the Church is infallible,-for the Spirit of Truth was with these   DAYS OF JAMES I.       101 individual teachers, according to your supposition, teaching them all truth. The Church being then infallible, must continue infallible for ever: and her teachings are neces- sarily true. "Second. If your position be true, there can be no orders outside of the Catholic Church, and consequently there can be no other church. At one period, you will admit, before any of the Protestant Churches existed, all Christian teachers and bishops taught the same Catholic faith, which you now assert to be false and corrupt, and from which the Reformers dissented and departed. These teachers were in orders and enjoying the accompanying promises of Christ, or else orders lhal failed and the pledges of Christ been broken, (for you apply them and affix them to the transmission of orders.) It is impossible that these promises should fail. They were then in orders and in the fruition of these pledges, according to you, individually; therefore they taught the truth infallibly, and all who rose up and taught a different or contrary doctrine, as did the Reformers, taught falsely and, according to the last suppo- sition, could not have orders; for in your sense the posses- sion of orders implies the presence of the Spirit of Truth, 'the Holy Ghost abiding within and teaching all truth--the in-dwelling of the Father and the Son,-the God of truth.' Then, there are no orders with the fruition of such pro- mises out of the Catholic Church-then there is no church but the Catholic Church. "But if it be true, that these promises of Christ do not apply to the individual teacher, or successor of the Apos- tles, then they must apply tq the body of teachers, of suc- cessors of the Apostles, as a teaching body, constant in its existence, unfailing in its teaching, immutable in its truth 9*   102       WILLITOFT, OR THE and its unity, and universal in its extent. And these are the attributes of the Roman Catholic Church. "It is, then, sufficiently clear that Christ can not be with the false teacher, and the Spirit of Truth abiding with him and teaching him all truth while he is sowing the seeds of error." "I think I can again safely admit your position," said William Scott. "Then," resumed Father Tichbourne, "my labor is nearly done: and, my good Sir, let me entreat you to listen with a clear mind and an unprejudiced heart and a softened will to my word-to the words of truth. I must now repeat a proposition to which I have already incidentally alluded. From the seventh to the fifteenth century, or to the eleventh say, for that will suit my argument as well, all Protestants admit, and all history testifies to the truth of the fact, that all Christian teachers with whom we are concerned, taught among other things, the Real Presence, Transubstantiation -the Infallibility of the Church as a teaching body under its head the Pope, the bishop of Rome, the successor of St. Peter--" "You must except the Greek Church!" interrupted Wil- liam Scott. "Is that Church the true Church, or is it not?" replied Father Tichbourne. "If it be, then there is an end of the question; for you do not believe the doctrines which its teachers-individual bishops--proclaim, and you and the teachers of your church are in error. If it be not the true Church, then we have no concern with it-the argument strikes at them as well as at your church. For this very doctrine of the Infallibility of the Church and the supre- macy of the Pope, you must admit was taught before the schism of the Greek Church; and the best evidence that it   DAYS OF JAMES I.       103 was taught is the schism itself, which was an effort on the part of the Greek bishops to usurp for their metropolitan, the Patriarch of Constantinople, those prerogatives, time- honored, before unassailed, belonging to the chair of Peter and the Church in communion with it. The Greek Church is then out of the question. "At one period, then, all Christian teachers, all Catholic teachers taught the Infallibility of the Church. Now this teaching was true or false. If false, they who taught it were false teachers and. Christ was not with them, and His Spirit-l' the Spirit of Truth,' was not 'abiding in them, teaching them all truth.' But there were no other teachers. Then all teachers were false Teachers, but Christ cannot be 'with' false teachers and these were the teachers who had succeeded the Apostles-His promises had therefore failed. He is not God, if these teachers were false teachers. But he is God, and his promises cannot fail, and he was with these teachers, according to your understanding of these promises 'teaching them all truth;' and they were true Teachers, proclaiming the Truth to all men. The Church is then infallible as they taught, and the promises of Christ do not refer to the individual teacher but to the Church as a Teaching body, and those who secede from that body become thereby false teachers. Thus, my dear Sir, your own false position clearly proves itself to be de- structive of all the superstructure you have reared upon it, and convicts you and your church of being illogical. For if followed out it proves the Truth of the opposite doctrine. It is suicidal." Father Tichbourne ceased, and gazed, for a time, in si. lence, upon the thoughtful countenance of William Scott. The young man did not move for sone moments, and a heavy cloud seemed to hang upon his thoughts. Suddenly I   -     104       WILLITOFT, OR THE his face lit up with a glow of satisfaction-he was not yet a real searcher after truth; for conviction seemed to make him sad, and escape from its power gave him joy. "'Ah!" he exclaimed, "I have it now, the key to your sophistry! I can explain it all, I can overthrow your posi- tion with a word!" Father Tichbourne smiled, but the smile faded from his gentle face, as the sad thought forced itself upon him that his companion still sought to fly from the truth. William Scott continued: "'In every age, there have been some persons who de- nied the doctrines of the Church of Dome and resisted her authority. Therefore your conclusion does not follow.- Christ's promises may have rested upon them, for while they continued true the gates of hell had not prevailed over his Church. The Spirit of Truth was with them!" "Let us see, my friend, how your argument will stand? First were these teachers and believers bishops?" "Some perhaps were, and some were not." "If they were not'bishops, then these promises of Christ could not refer to them, for they were not successors of the Apostles. If they were bishops; by whom were they taught and ordained? By those against whose teachings they rose up and rebelled, whose teachings had been universally re- ceived before that rebellion: whose teachings must therefore have been true, and their rebellion, the origin of false doc- trine. But these heresies -from which you wish to derive the existence of your church, lived each but for a brief day; and even in that short existence were 'tossed about by every wind of doctrine.' "There was no such church in existence, at or just prior to the Reformation, which taught these doctrines, which according to you are the true doctrines: if there had been,   DAYS OF JAMES I.       105 there could have been no Reformation; for the truth alrea- dy existed and was professed in its purity, according to your idea. But the Reformers professed that they were the first to preach the new doctrines of Protestantism, and that these doctrines were not taught prior to their coming. The doctrines, therefore, taught prior to the Reformation were false doctrines, their teachers) false teachers; and the promises of Christ had failed, for He was no longer with any teachers or teaching bbdy. His Spirit was no longer teaching them all truth; and there is an end of Christianity and Revelation. But this is impossible; heaven and earth may pass away, but His word cannot pass away. He was with the teachers, or rather the teaching body, before the Reformation, that body taught the truth in his all-saving name--that body was the True Church, the Holy Roman, Catholic, Apostolic Church. "Again, the true teachers must always be in existence, always teaching the truth, filled with the Spirit of truth, and proclaiming the Gospel of Christ to the world. Then the true teachers were proclaiming!his true c doctrine ' just prior to the moment when the first Reformer arose, and there could be no reformation, no change for the better; for the truth was already known-and taught, and if there was a change in doctrine, as there was at that period, it must have been an alteration of the truth. The word Reformation bears historical evidence to the opinion of those who called them- selves Reformers. It testifies to their belief that they altered the doctrine then taught as Christian truth throughout the world. It- was then corrupt in all teachers before their coming or it was not; if it was not, then it was taught purely by some teachers, and there could be no change but only a spreading of the old and known truth. But you and they, and all followers of them, assert that they altered   106       WILLITOPT, OR THE and. reformed-not rules and morals--but articles of faith and doctrine. This change, therefore, was either an error, or all teachers just prior to it were in error, and then the promises of Christ had failed. But the promises of Christ had not failed, therefore this change of the reformation was error. "It is not necessary to multiply arguments such as these founded upon the assumption that these promises of Christ refer to the individual successors of the Apostles, to each bishop or teacher, and not to the Church as a teaching body. The same arguments will apply to national churches as composed of individual bishops, and wanting the sacred aggregation and perpetuity of the Roman Catholic Church. "And now, Sir, let me turn toa more pleasing duty than that of overthrowing false positions. Let me assert the true ground and defend it. I have already proved the In- fallibility of the Church by proving that the promises of Christ cannot apply to the individual teacher. Let me prove to you that they were made to the body of teachers, as a body, united under one head, universal, ever existent, infallible, ever teaching--her mission covering the earth and stretching through the future to the consummation of time!" "If you can prove me that," exclaimed William Scott, "I shall believe what she teaches; I shall bow in submis- sion to her mandates, as the unfailing, and unerring witness of God's word." "That -is a necessary consequence," said Father Tich- bourne," necessary and unavoidable to the sincere searcher after truth. And now," he continued, as he arose and took from one of the shelves of the library a massive folio, clasped with gold and beautifully embossed, and laid it on the stand before him, " and now I will turn to the Book of books-   DAYS OF JAMES T.       107 which the Catholic Church has guarded as the apple of her eye; which she has preserved, and for the possession of which all the Protestant world is indebted to her care-to the diligence and uncomplaining toil of her abused monks. The Bible you believe contains the word of God: I believe the same, but I also am bound to believe every word which issued from the lips of God. The Bible itself informs us that it does not contain all. It contains enough to prove my position--the Infallibility of the Church. "Let me begin with St. Matthew. St. Peter has just confessed his faith in Christ, and, "'Jesus answering said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh a nd blood have not revealed it to thee, but my Father, who is in heaven. "' And I say to thee that thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against IT. And I will give to THEE the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose, it shall be loosed also in heaven.'* "And further, in chapter 18, v. 17, he says: 'If thy bro- ther shall offend thee, go and reprove him between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee thou shalt gain thy brother: But if he will not hear thee, take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may stand: And if he will not hear them, tell the Church, and if he will not hear the Church, let hin be to thee as the heathen and the publican. "'Amen I say to you whatsoever you shall bind upon earth shall be bound also in heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth shall be loosed also in heaven.' St. Matt. xvi.   ,t  / 1-08       WILLUTOPT, OR THE , The Greek word aceri0-, which is translated ' offend' means 'to differ-wander,-to sin,' &ac. Now, to whom were these promises made, and these orders given? To the same persons-to the Apostles and their successors. They, who have the power of binding and loosing, are those who are ordered to go and reprove the sinning and erring brother, and if he will not hear them, in fine to call in the authority of the Church and cut off the wanderer from the fold. Now, this does not allude to mere private quarrels and differences between Christians, for such things gene- rally arise from mutual misunderstandings, and this rule would make the one party a witness against the other and a judge over him, for he is first to reprove him in secret,- and therefore to judge of the right or the wrong of the con- troversy-and then to 'take with him one or two others, that out of the mouth of two or three witnesses '-including himself, therefore, the party who is wronged--' every word may stand' against him. Again, it is clear that this com- mand only refers to those who are in authority in the Church, for if it be construed to extend to all Christians, and as making out a rule for the settlement of private quar- rels; then it clearly applies to both parties to such quarrel, for each will believe that he is the wronged and offended party; each, therefore, will judge the other, will reprove the other, will bear witness against the other, and thus instead of settling the strife, this wlord of the divine peace-maker, would only tend to increase strife and contention. "But how has this direction been applied by the early ages of the Church, and by all ages since. Those who wandered from the true doctrine of the Catholic Church were, first warned and reproved privately by their superiors, the successors of the Apostles, whom our Lord addressed; if they failed to listen to these admonitions, the powers of   DAYS OF JAMES I.       t69 Church were solemnly appealed to, their errors examined and condemned; and if they then refused to submit to that authority and retract those errors, they were excommuni- cated and became ' as the heathen and the publican.' "Our Saviour has just given the solemn promise to Simon Barjona, that he will build his Church upon him--a rock. He has changed his name to that of Rock, for thenceforth he was called Peter, which in the language used by our Lord was identical with ' Rock.' In that tongue, his words, were these: ' Simon Barjona, thou art the Rock, and upon this Rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it,' &c. And ever after he was called Peter, or Simon Peter, that is, ' Simon, the Rock,' or ' Rock.' Is there not something wonderful in this change of name?  Does it not appear as if our Lord desired to meet every cavil against the primacy of St. Peter, by giving a constant and enduring evidence of his position and au- thority, by keeping it constantly before the eyes of his fol- lowers in the very nalne with which they were to address their earthly head. He was the Rock of the foundation of the Church--the rock of the building to which Christ allud- ed when he spoke of the Wise Builder, who built his house upon a rock, and the storms came, and the winds and waves Meat against it in vain. For this reason he says the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it-speaking of the Church as one body. "To describe its compactness and unity, and unwavering strength, he calls IT, a body, a building, a compact struc- ture. He speaks of this body, too, as a body in authority, a  body teaching, a body judging, a body from whose sen- tence there is no appeal. For after commanding his Apos- tles and the individual teachers to reprove an erring brother and to call in the authority of the Church, he adds, (and if 10   "O       WILLITOFT," OR THE he will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as the hea- then and the publican.' And then it is, that he gives to them, the subordinate authorities of the Church, that pro- mise which he had already made to the Rock, on which they were- to be built up, the- foundation stone which was to sustain them in the unity of the building-Simon Peter, Prince of the Apostles. "But let us take another view of this command of re- proving a brother. This command was addressed to the Apostles and to their successors, for whatever commands were given to them, were given to them either as Apostles or as private men: but it is clear that they were here ad- dressed as Apostles, as teachers, as the founders under Christ of the new Church; for the whole passage refers to that very point and marks out the economy, so to call it, of religion-to the very object of their being called, the salva- tion of men'by the preaching of the Gospel; but the com- mands given to the Apostles are also given to their succes- sors. What is the subject?-the offence of the brother, of the man,'for all Christian men are brethren,-the sin, the wandering from the true faith of Christ. What could be the offence against the Apostolic teacher but the rejection of his doctrine-what the sin of the Christian against his bishop but the disobedience in matters of faith, morality and discipline--things alone within the jurisdiction of spi- ritual teachers-for Christ came not to establish a civil and earthly kingdom, but a spiritual and heavenly one-one to take cognizance of things relating to eternity. Or if you will not allow of this explanation, you must admit that a wider interpretation of the words only makes the case stronger, for it includes mine, and a narrower one cannot be made. Every errors in faith, every departure from the truth must offend against the teacher; and therefore the,   DAYS OF JAMES' I.      ll teacher must reprove the offender who wanders in faith as XI    well as him who offends in any other spiritual or temporal manner. And the offender against faith, if he be obstinate in his offence, becomes amenable to the power of the Church and must be anathematized according to any con- struction. "The arguments upon this subject are endless: I need not point out to you how this discipline, this command, necessarily tends, as a mere human instrument to preserve the purity of the faith, by cutting off and segregating the !A 4false from the true, or how when carried into effect under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, which is with and inspiring the Church, it becomes an infallible guard of its purity and vitality. "It is useless for me to discuss or explain the texts which I have read to you, doubtless they and many others are familiar to you." "I cannot think it necessary to look for more authority," replied William Scott slowly, "if these, which I presume are among the strongest, are insufficient-then the others would not satisfy me. I know these texts; but I confess I Ki \did not read them altogether in the same light that you I:   - have done: though we are in the habit of quoting them against those who deny our church authority -" "Pardon a somewhat rude interruption, my young friend," said Father Tichbourne, "but would it not be more appro- priate to quote from Acts of Parliament for the origin and authority of the Church of Englayrd, which has been alter- ed, amended, revised and improved, as suited the fancy of each party or monarch in authority." "Alas! too true!" replied William Scott, with a sad 'smile. After a moment's pause he continued, "Ah! how the spirit clings to the teachings of other years-Bitter is                       *   "2   WILLITOFT,. OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I. the struggle between the present and the past. Good Sir, permit me to retire. I have heard things that will afford me food for reflection, and am no longer fit to converse --"; and taking up his hat he abruptly left the room, and departing from the house without seeing any one, mounted his horse and gallopped rapidly away. Father Tichbourne gazed after him from a window, as he dashed along, and with a quiet smile upon his gentle countenance, exclaimed, 'If he be sincere-he is saved!" "What!" muttered William Scott, as his chafed steed galled with unceasing spurring, bounded through the open gateway, "What? if the promises of Christ have failed?" In life, hope and despair are seldom far asunder.   CHAPTER VII.

At length, how- ever, they drew up their horses upon the bank of a beauti- ful rivulet, which emptied itself into the larger stream a few miles below them in the plain. A youth was busily angling under the shadow of the trees which overhung the water: and the two friends, having remarked the continued ab- sence of William Scott, determined to await his coming at this pleasant spot. Dismounting from their horses, they reclined upon the shaded grass, watching the movements of the young fisherman. For some time, the conversation turned upon the art of angling, of which Scott was a de- voted follower: while Alton depreciated it as an occupation unworthy of the dignity of manhood. An agreeable dis- cussion arose between the two friends, which was soon ab- ruptly terminated by a delighted exclamation of the youth near them, who at that m'oment had struck a noble trout and was playing it to exhaust its strength before he ventur- ed to land it. The powerful fish darted from side to side, stretching the line to its greatest tension, and making it snap against the surface, whilst he dashed the sparkling 10*            ,  ijj'                   4   "4       WILLITOFT, OR THE water up into foam around him, as in vain efforts to break the hold of the hook, he threw himself upward and again darted fiercely into the depths of the dark pool." "By heaven! call you that a sport unfit for man, Alton?" exclaimed Scott, springing from his seat in the excitement of a' true angler. "Take care, boy; or you will lose him," he continued quickly as the youth, deceived by a moment- ary cessation in the struggles of the captive, attempted to draw him to land. At the first tension of the line, the strong fish darted rapidly up the stream, making the slender line almost whistle as it rushed through the current. "Follow him.-There! keep him under; he will snap the hold with those sudden leaps.--So!---Don't let him touch the bottom, or your fish is gone.-There he goes again! Give me the rod, he is too cunning for you." Springing forward, George Scott grasped the rod of the young fisherman; and following the trout gave him full play, and by skilful touches of the line baffled every art and repressed every struggle of the captive, broke his power without giving him a single opportunity to test the strength of the delicate line, which must have snapped like thread under a clear swift jerk, and at length landed -the panting and unresisting victim on the grass. The fish was, indeed, a noble one. Holding him up in triumph before his com- panion, he said, "Ah, tell me, Alton, is he not a glorious fellow? How I love him for that last struggle! It was a splendid feat, and he would have been free but for a skill greater than his owu. Tell me not, Alton, that this sport is unworthy of manhood. It is noble to contend with a strong fish like this, and to conquer him with a hair which his own dead weight would break. You smile! Well, Alexander may have conquered the world, but I doubt if he could have landed that gallant trout with a single hair."   IDAS OF JAMES I.       115 The young angler was in extacies, and resigning his rod to Scott, in whom he saw a master of the gentle craft, was well content to follow him far down the stream, while he successfully whipped the stream at every point, his whole attention wrapped up in the healthful and joyous sport. Alton, disdaining even to watch his progress, drew a book from his pocket and began to peruse it, occasionally turn- ing from its pages to scan the movements of a school of little fish which had gathered in myriads in the shallows along the edge of the water. The horses with their bridles slipped, leisurely cropped the luxuriant grass. Time passed unheeded, each one deeply immersed in his own occupation-Scott and the youth wandering along the margin of the stream, and Alton in the pages of his book under the pleasant shade. At length, Alton closed his book and sat intently gazing upon the water, absorbed in thought. And what scene so pro- motive and suggestive of meditation as the shaded bank of a bright, clear, murmuring stream? The rippling of the waters, the soft sighing of the gentle zephyr, toying with the foliage, the hum of life, the music of birds-the beau- tiful dwellers of the stream leaping ever and anon to sight and displaying their golden speckled charms; the pure sky above; air, the very breathing of which exhilarates and en- livens; and all around spread living pictures from the hand of God,-all mingling into a chaotic harmony of beauty and delight, which elevates the soul and etherealizes the sensations of the heart. It is a world for thought and day dreams. But Alton's meditations were, at length, broken in upon by the sound of a horse's hoof gallopping rapidly along the road to the spot where he reclined. In a few minutes the horseman reached the bank and was about to dash  I   t16      WILLTTOPT, OR -THE through the stream at the samhe headlong pace, when Alton sprang from his recumbent position and ran towards him, shouting, "Stop, friend, stop! Why, Scott, whither away so fast? You ride as if evil spirits were pursuing you." "And they are!" said William Scott, as he reined back his horse, somewhat mortified at the discovery of his per- turbation of mind. Dismounting, he permitted his panting steed to join the other horses still grazing quietly on the rich herbage, and took a seat beside Alton who had quietly returned to his former position in the shade. Alton perceived that something had occurred to disturb the serenity of his friend's mind, but with all the gentle tact of true politeness forbore to question him, while he endeavored to direct his attention from his present mood. No readier mode presented itself to him than to engage him upon the subject which then filled his own thoughts, and accordingly he followed up the thread of his musings from the point where he had been interrupted. "Scott, I was thinking how wonderfully all nature is constructed!-'How much infinite wisdom!-What infinite reason!-What infinite beauty and benevolence, and regu- larity are ever displayed before our view." "Yes!" replied William -Scott, brightening into a more cheerful expression, " and yet how easily do we close our eyes to all this beauty and perfection of God's works, and live on as if we were surrounded by the imperfect works of our own hands, as if we, man, were the only Reason in existence; as if man were the supreme intelligence! It is only in the midst of His works that we feel truly his power: not when man lives afar from nature, crowded into cities, surrounded by his own handicraft, with the beautiful earth crushed down by his own works, its fertility, its miraculous   DAYS OF JAMES I.       117 and rejuvenating powers buried beneath endless piles of brick and mortar and plains of paving stones; the air of heaven itself no longer such as God gave it for the life and health of man, but filled with the pestilential odor of man's works; the bright sun no longer shining in clear unclouded skies as He sent it forth from His hand for the joy and liglt and hope of the world, but dim, 'ark and lurid, as depair, struggling through the mists, smoke, and impuri- tes which hang over and envelope the city. He who lives in nature, the world of God, is more tuned to the worship of God than he who lives in the crowded city, the world of man, and his pride and corruption." "And yet, my friend," said Alton, "how often do we not degrade the intelligence of the Deity below our own, and assimilate his works to our own. See yonder tree, how it grows. The buds have come in their proper order; they have bloomed, bursting out into little leaves; and those have gone on increasing with the season, until they have come to their full growth, when they will soon begin to de- cline and reach that point, when, sear and yellow, they will wither, fall and, decaying, mingle with the earth-furnish- ing new substance for another spring's blooming, which shall pass through the same course, varied only by the va- riations of the seasons. Thus for many a thousand years have they bloomed and fallen-the trees themselves in like manner dying and renewing themselves, as it were, in their young shoots. How changeless this law of nature! The work of the Deity needs no supervision. He has given their laws to his creations as they passed perfect from his hands, and never after need they the superintending care of any hand or any will-as in a perfect vacuum, philoso- phers say, a body once set in motion would for ever move without further impetus. And this remindsme of our con-   "8       WILLITOFT, OR THE versation of this morning, Scott.--Do you think that the roots of yonder tree could grow at the top and the leaves bloom under ground, if the superintending care of the Al- mighty God were not ever turned upon it as the gardener watches, prunes, and waters? And if they did, would it anger his Omnipotence and bring the lightning blast upon it?" "There is a vast difference, Alton, between trees and men!" replied William Scott, with a smile. "Trees have their laws and follow them without choice by a happy ne- cessity. And so with the physical growth of man. Man's soul has its laws too, but God has gifted it with free will, and it needs must abuse the gift by disobeying the giver." "Do you mark that school of fish, the myriads that are sporting there?" said Alton. "Do you see how they move hither and thither as it lists them? They have a will and they exercise it. They have instincts and appetites, given them by God, and they gratify them without restraint. What! think you that an omnipotent God should lay an injunction on yonder little fish to prohibit him from grasp- ing the-flies, which-skimming along the surface above him excite that appetite so given him, and then inflict an eternal punishment for the breach of the command whose observ- ance his own gifts have rendered difficult if not impossible? Believe you that this Infinite God troubles himself whether they swim up or down or across the stream, whether they gratify the appetites he has bestowed upon them or not? No! no, he has given them a certain conformation and ha- bits and desires to suit,-and to man likewise. And why should he concern himself if man swim hither or thither in the stream of life? He, having once framed animated na- ture and rolled it from his hands, its laws are as fixed and immutable as those which govern the blooming, falling and   A           DAYS OF JAMES I.       119 renewing of yonder foliage: whilst the fate of man is affect- ed by accidents and circumstances, as the condition of that foliage by the favorable or unfavorable season." Ii   "You forget the difference between soul and mere life!" said William Scott. X    "No -who can tell the difference? Animals have will and memory and understanding: man in a higher degree- good-of misery for unavoidable evil. These are mysteries!" "Then why seek to fathom them? Rest satisfied with faith!" interrupted William Scott. "I confess the subject is a difficult one, Scott," replied Alton, "but methinks many as difficult could be found in the doctrine of Brahma or the dreams of Confucius, or the visions of Mohammed: and yet methinks, Scott, in their case, you would reject their doctrines if they did not stand the test of your reason, if you could not comprehend them. Here, however, you are pleased to accept whatever relics of the old superstition the sage reformers thought proper to retain, and stamp by their approval with the seal and authority of the Divinity. For heaven's sake, be a man!- Snatch from our would be thousand Popes the sceptre and tiara, which grace them not, or turn monk at once, in God's name, and be rational and/logical by following irrationality to its last extreme-or by following reason in its own pure light!" "Alton, you wander strangely from the subject," inter- posed William Scott , "Yes, my friend, I could not help connecting our sub- ject with that of our morning's conversation. You talked of the superintending care of Providence--what think you He heeds of us, the creatures of his hands, as subject to his laws as yonder foliage or yonder fish, who, alike, can-   120       -WILLITOFT, OR THE not disobey what are really his laws. I cannot understand this doctrine of a will free to choose, and yet with an eter- nal penalty to follow upon the choice. What! an Infinite Goodness gives to man desires, propensities, longings---Lo! I give you these! Dare not to enjoy them! Never give them rein. You are free to exercise them, but if you do, eternal death awaits you! Here are joys surrounding you. I have made them for you ; I have given you the capacity to enjoy them, and the never-ceasing desire to obtain them. Taste and you shall perish! Here is the fruit of love and beauty! I have made thine eye to quicken at its sight, and thy veins to swell, thy heart to throb and thy blood to glow, until rea- son shall lose its power and thou shalt sink, like the charm- ed bird, in voluptuous abandonment into the arms of the charmer, whom I have made irresistible. Take heed if thou yieldest thou shalt die! Oh, Great Deity! how hast thou been blasphemed by those false servants of thine, who pre- tend to prescribe bounds to thy mercy and limits to thy justice: who have made thy gifts curses, and thy promises direful threats; who have made the Infinitude of Reason the infinitude of all absurdities; who have robbed thee of all the attributes of thy Divinity!" "Alas! Alton, into what horrible dream have you fallen? Into what dread heresies have you wandered?" "Heresies!" exclaimed Alton, scornfully, as he raised himself proudly up. "Heresies I Scott, that word is of the past!- Does. the Church of England, our mother, use the term? --" "Ay does she; and moreover the laws provide a punish- ment for heretics!" said Scott enegetically. 'True, most true" replied Alton bitterly. "True.' The Kmng, Lords, and Commons, not content with the old order of things, have made a new church, upon the ground that   DAYS OF JAMES I.        121 man's reason was his guide--and then have ruled that all shall follow the single path marked out by Iheir worshipful reason as the truth. Permit me however to deny their right to force their reason upon mnine, to take'aw'ay from me the guide which they themselves proclaim that the God of ea- son has given me. Heresies! Sir, there is no heresy for the spirit-God within us! for that spirit which is of the breath of the Creator, which is of him, which is in him! God is reason; and the soul of man is the scintillation of that reason. His free will is the free will of the Deity, and as untrammelled-let him follow it!" "Whither, my poor friend, whither will these doctrines lead you? Alas, are they not at war with Christianity? Do they not strike at the roots of the whole system?" said William Scott, soothingly. "What care I for systems or for priestcraft, which is the origin of systems! Where is the priest that God has given more eyes than he has given me, more ears, more senses, more reason--upon whom he has bestowed the powers re- quisite to lead me rightly as well as to preserve himself in truth. If I be blind, how shall he lead me, who is as blind as I. If mny reason is to yield to the reason of another, why is that other not marked out to me, so that I may know and rely on him? Pshaw! if I but put me on a black robe and a band, and wear me a long face, and say,' my beloved,' wherefore should I not be the guide of others instead of being guided? And if I do this, will it make me better able to guide them? Away, Scott, away with all this stage play -this priestcraft! It is well to gull the ignorant with.- We should know better!" "But, Alton, said Scott, becoming uneasy--" but God has bestowed authority'and grace upon the priesthood and " li   1P2       WILLITOFT, OR THE the Church; and has marked them out as our sure guides and teachers." "They say so--but who vouches for them? This is all Romish superstition! Show me that they are infallible, and I will yield my fallible judgment to them. The Church of Rome is wise to teach her own infallibility-could I believe that, as long as I believe in a God, I would be obliged to" believe her doctrines: for, however mysterious her dogmas, I would have the word of a God, by his unfailing witness, to convince me of their truth and to prove to me that my rea- soning is false; and that would satisfy Reason herself. You are silent-well, I do not wonder. Every argument which you could bring against me, you must borrow from Rome- and every one of them shows you to be on false ground. You are pausing half way.! I know it,'" he continued, as he observed -the darkening brow of his companion. "I have stood upon the same ground. You are standing half way between reason and superstition. It is where the Church stands, where the blind and the indifferent stand. But you and I, and such as will examine, must go farther: We must drop all subterfilges--follow the light which God has given us. We must embrace the pure religion of Rea- son! I have done this. You will do this; for you are not one to rest satisfied under the yoke and to submit to the hoodwink. You will struggle a little with your early pre- judices. You will look many times backward: but your march will be onwards, onwards; until your spirit will stand free and unchained, upright, worthy of its God! Oh! Scott, the day is coming when the disenthralment of man shall be complete! You are one of those spirits who must aid in the great work that is going on!--The Reformation was but the beginning, but the foundation stone, on which is to be reared the great edifice of Freedom, the entering place   DAYS OF JAMES I.       123 j^ of the wedge which must tear asunder the bonds which have so long held enslaved the human race. Awaken my friend! Awaken! Be one of the new apostles who shall announce the dawn of a true religion, of a bright sun-rising for Humanity!" Horror-stricken and speechless, William Scott drew back from the earnest gaze of the excited speaker, as if he had been a demon in human form. Who shall say what thoughts rushed through his soul at that moment? Did he dwell upon the words of the priest? the picture of the past? the recollections of the ages of faith? Or did he gather it jbefore him into one dark field all the offspring of that age of Reason whose dawning was predicted. Alas! he could not dream of half its thousand horrors, of half its bloodshed and its misery--when in after years the fruition of its doc- trine came like a storm of crime and terror on the world! Or could he have looked upon it as some heavenly Utopia, which should renew the bliss of the first Paradise and re- store man to his original felicity? "Scott," continued Alton, hurriedly as if he feared inter- ruption. "Scott, time was when I bowed the willing head to the behests of men like myself who claimed to be from God, but whose only commission was in their own mouths. I listened with docility, and believed with humility. Yes, that is the phrase. But a moment came when reason awoke, and avenged her long slumber. Listen and laugh!. It is a strange tale--nd will make a good Churchman laugh: Reason exclaimed, "' Lo! you, there! You listen to these men proclaiming their authority so loudly, whence comes it?' And Scott I assure you it was hard for me to answer Reason: but I told her: 'It came from Christ and his Apostles.' That was the lesson they had taught me. But Reason asked He   124       WILLITOFT, OR THE again: ' How comes it?' 'By the Church in constant suc- cession,' I replied at last.--'  But did not these men or their recent predecessors, from whom they claim descent,' she asked, ' rebel against the authority of those who preceded them, and depart from the belief of the vast majority of their own time, and in so doing break through the unity that once prevailed?' 'True!'-and there, Scott, I was silent. How could I answer her?" "How, indeed?" said Scott, unconsciously, half aloud. "When Madam Reason had put me wrong there," con- tinued Alton, "I determined that I must up and away, or at least look about me and examine my foothold. I con-, eluded that, as there was authority in the world, and as these men had rebelled against an Authority existent for ages before they came, that doubtless that authority was right, and to it I must submit. And so, I began to examine the teachings and doctrines of the Church of Rome. Sin- gular, was it not?" "Singular, indeed!" said Scott, whose mind was filled with the unexpected coincidence of his friend's former situation and his own present condition of mind, and was considering whether it was thus that his doubts too would terminate. Were infidelity or Catholicity the only alterna- tives for a reasoning mind?"Singular, indeed!" "Well, Scott, I did not get far in my examination. Luckily--I say luckily, for I found much of logical sequence in its doctrines, and more of fascinating beauty than I was at first willing to acknowledge-than I would now confess to most persons:-but luckily my friends got wind of it in -time to save me from delusion, and to bring the Jesuit on whom I had called for instruction to the block." Alton sighed deeply as if affected by the sad reminiscence. "He died nobly---but I was rescued. A few choice companions   DAYS OF JAMES I.       125 soon brought me to cast away the melancholy recollection of his fate, and to abandon the dull studies into which he had inducted me. Add to this, the pleasures of London, where ceaseless gaiety soon turned my mind into other channels. But reason still was at work, and, as I had for- saken the system of the Church of Rome as a snare and a delusion, so I judged of the Church of England, and other churches and systems devised by cunning men, to enable them to grow fat upon the simple ones. And, as the Re- formers, after mature deliberation, had concluded that they might reject what appeared. to them unreasonable in reli- gion, I determined to test even their acts by my reason and to reject whatever I found inconsistent with it. This carried me c farther, doubtless, than they had ever fore- seen as the necessary result of their doctrine. Thus doubt ended in freedom-freedom from spiritual bondage, free- domn from superstition. I came to-know the real bounty of the gifts which He has given us, the desires, the capa- bilities which He has bestowed upon us. And you, Scott, are destined to pass beyond the position which you now hold, and to follow a purer doctrine." "What if the promises of Christ have failed!" said Scott, again falling suddenly into the train of deep thought which the conversation of Alton had broken, but back to which it now naturally led him. "What if these have failed--then, then-Ah! I must go farther than he has gone!-then,- away with Christianity, Religion, God!"    126   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I. A long and, apparently, intensely interesting conversation, of which the listener could not have gathered the import, was carried on in tonies, the one becoming gradually calm- er, the other more soothingo, earnest, and impressive. At length the visitor departed as rapidly as he had come, his head bowed low and shaded by his long plume and broad hat. And Father Tichbourne came forth from the library, his face radiant with joy and his whole countenance lighted up with enthusiastic zeal. t   PART SECOND.  We'll prey on them: And with their hearts' dear treasures, and their faith, And love, we'll pave our dark way to sueeess.     CHAPTER    VIII A Calm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix; Of crooked counstels, and dark politics."-POPe.! IN the dining room of a handsome residence, a few hours' ride distant from Willitoft, not many days after the date of the incidents recounted in the last chapter, were seated two persons discussing a bottle of port, whose fine qualities they seemed to forget in the subject which engrossed their conversation. The one was of middle stature, and somewhat advanced in years: his eyes were keen and restless, the lids furrowed; his brow was wrinkled with the marks of a certain kind of intellect which is often found in the cunning and the bad. Around his thin lips played ever a cynic smile, sometimes, for a momeont, darkening into legible bitterness. It seemed, in him, lilke the expression of scorn and contempt for his kind. He played somewhat impatiently with his glass, which he rarely emptied, although he passed the bottle fre- quently to the person sitting opposite him, who evinced by his bearing that he was but a temporary companion, while his boisterous humor and, at times, presumptuous manner, proved that he felt himself necessary to the stern, dark man before him. Yet, ever and anon, some too familiar blunt- ness of speech called forth a scowl upon the face of the elder of the two, which made his laugh die away upon his lips, and his voice falter, even 'emboldened as he was by his situation and the wine he had taken. "I tell you, Rodewell," said the elder, that this matter must be brought to a close as soon as possible. This tam-   130       WILLITOFT, OR THE pering with the laws must not be permitted longer. I feel for my old friend-but justice must take its course." "And there is a good estate, too, Sir Henry, to be grant- ed-in that case," said Rodewell, with a familiar smile, which at once darkened the brow of the knight. "The granting of the estate, in case it should be forfeit- ed, is a matter for-the council of his majesty; for me, the only course is to do my duty as a magistrate without regard to consequences.--I urge y3ou to do your duty as zealously, and you, at least shall be rewarded. In your last effort, you failed most signally. I must have something better next time or-seek another agent." "You know, Sir Henry, that unforeseen circumstances occurred to prevent success. How could I know that Hurlstone would fall sick and then hold mum " "Dolt, do you not see in that, the very avenue to suc- cess opening to you?" "How, Sir Henry?" said Rodewell incredulously; " why, Hurlstone was worth a dozen such fellows as him whom I sent to search the house. He knew all about those places as he was one of them long ago." "Simply thus, master pursuivant. Hurlstone, you say, was taken sick and betook himself to the house of his bro- ther, who -had married a kind of upper servant at Willitoft. There you found him and were coldly received by him, whilst his brother watched you as if he suspected your mis- sion. Now the younger brother, doubtless, is a papist. His uneasiness arose either front the fact of his having something to conceal, or because he had gained from his brother a knowledge of his former way of life, which of it- self implies a conversion of some kind on the part of the sick man. Couple this with the coldness and wariness of your former friend towards you, and you have grounds to   DAYS OF JAMES I.       131 suspect that a priest has been there. Some one has made him relapse, rely on it, an inmate of Willitoft. Now, your course is this: entrap your old comrade; gain his confi- dence. We will have him arrested as he is now convales- cent, and through him we will reach the others, unless in- deed you can succeed in winning him back to his old work again, which would be as well." "Ah! I see.-Your idea is a good one, and I can frame a plan upon it, I am sure. But you must admit that my first plan was not unlikely to succeed, before this cursed change came over Hurlstone. Who could have foreseen, that instead of feigning sickness, to get through his brother the attendance of a priest supposed to be at Willitoft, he should really have been taken ill, and baffled all our designs. The thought of death, when we believe ourselves within his grasp, makes us all cowards." " Enough of that, master Rodewell!" interrupted Sir Henry with a frown, " but take care that this effort 'end not like the other. You look at that empty bottle, I mark it- but as it is necessary that you proceed at once with a clear heed, I shall not order another at present. I know your capacity, but will not tempt it." "You are right, Sir Henry; this wine would seduce me from any thing " "But villainy and plunder," muttered the knight, while the other continued--"And, therefore, with ybur permis- sion I will retire."         ' "Take with you what men you want, and here is some gold to smooth your path. Your reward shall be what I promised in case of success." Master Rodewell emptied the money into the purse which hung at his girdle, bowed low, and left the room.   132       WILLITOFT, OR THE. A serviceable villain that--but a villain- still," thought the knight as the door closed behind him, while the look of grave deference which master Rodewell had put on in the latter part of the conversation, gave place to a smile of mingled cunning and triumph. "He pays well, old miser though he be. Bah! not yet, Sir Henry. This work is too . fruitful to be finished so soon. I will not kill the hen that gives me golden eggs. There is something deeper than mere justice and execution of the laws in the heart of Sir Henry--and I will share his plunder." 'Hastening into the hall, master Rodewell, as soon as he encountered one of the servitors of the knight, assumed an air of consequence, abd directed his horse to be saddled and brought, to the door. In a few moments he was gal. lopping rapidly towards the neighboring village of Under- wood. He reined in his steed before the little inn, and giving him in charge to the hostler, entered with a bold and patronising air, casting a glance of dignified recognition uponl the obsequious host. "Good den, mine host," he said, "be kind enough to summon my attendant and send me a flagon of claret. Sir Henry's fine old wine needs a cooling off.'/' "And none can furnish you a better stoup, than your humble servant," said Giles Horstead.--"And so you have been dining with Sir Henry Marsden, our good landlord." "Yes, mihe host, 1 have had the honor," replied Rode- well, as he passed on to the little room which he halt occu- pied since the commencement of his present schemes. In a short time, mine host placed the pint of claret upon the ta- ble and ushered in the person for whom his guest had asked. "Well, John, the old fox has given me a rating for that miscarriage of yours at Willitoft. He is determined that the law must be put in',force, and the sooner the better.   DAYS OF JAMES I.       133 But I say, unless his mode of pay changes, the slower the better; you understand. By the way, it was very fortunate that you and Henderson were prevented from succeeding in your first effort: each delay brings us a new perquisite." "I can tell you, master Rodewell, the delay there was no fault of mine. We searched well, as I have often assur- ed you, and as Henderson would bear witness were he here. It arose altogether from the presence and interfer- ence of that young Scott, whom the country people were unwilling to offend." "Nonsense, John! He served us better stead than you or Henderson. See you not that by the delay we shall make twice the profit we could have won by instant suc- cess. The old fox over there is becoming more liberal as his anxiety increases. But enough of this. You must go to Hurlstone's-you know the place--get in with the peo- ple by some  mode or other; worm his secret out of our old companion or from his brother; and when we succeed so far, it will be time enough for us to raise new difficulties and receive more purses." "But what plan now, master Rodewell?" "Never heed you that, good John; I plan, you execute." "Well, so be it. And when?" "At once, John Foxly! Be earnest and successful in the preliminaries, and you can afford -to fail in the after part: for people will lay the blame on circumstances. No- thing like a character for activity, John!" '"You know mine, master Rodewell, for instance, -. and he raised the measure of claret to his mouth and drained it at a draught. "That will do, John, that will do. Quite a convincing proof of bibulous activity!" said Rodewell quietly, accus- tomed to his assistant's pranks. "Now, as I am master 12   134       WILLITOPT, OR THE for the nonce, you may go, and don't forget to send in an- other pint." John Foxly took his leave, and the host brought in ano- ther measure of wine, which Rodewell discussed leisurely, pausing occasionally to meditate upon the project which filled his mind. At length he seized the flagon, emptied the remaining contents, rose from his seat, and approached a travelling case, muttering, "I must ferret this out myself. Scott was there; he had his reasons for his conduct and his servants will know it-and I shall know it." Unlooking the case, he drew forth an apparel which-one unacquainted with his calling, would scarce have expected to find there. The exchange of dress was rapidly made, and he surveyed himself satisfactorily in a mirror. "As good a beggar as any in the Savoy! Now, to see whether mine host will recognize me!" He opened the window and leaped to the ground-and, passing to the front of the house entered it with an humble air and took his seat on a stool in the tap-room. Giles Horstead heeded him not for a few minutes, until the dis- guised pursuivant in a piteous tone began to rehearse an imaginary tale of woe, which mine host stoutly interrupted, ordering him to begone and seek relief from the parish rate which good Queen Bess had raised, God bless her! for the relief of the poor. "Only a crust," said the pretended beggar. "Not a crust, not a crust! you lazy loon! Go to the parish!" "It was not so *hen the monasteries were about, they say a poor body could always get food and lodging with- out--  "Yes, yes, you all say that-all of you. But we have things better now. No more of your fat, lazy monks!   DAYS OF -JA"ES I.      135 Good King Harry sent them all trooping; and if' you don't troop, I'll let my bull-dog loose upon you or my name's not Giles Horstead." "That will do," said Rodewell, as he gathered his rags about him and limped away as fast as was consistent with his assumed character. Turning his steps in the direction of the residence of the Scotts, he walked on increasing his speed as he left the little village behind him. An hour's walk brought him to the house, and he quietly crept into the kitchen and asked for a crust of bread. The cook placed before him some broken victuals, which he eat with an avidity that would have astonished his late host. Sir Henry Marsden. In the pauses of his meal, he endeavored to draw the cook into conversation, but as such officials are rarely good humored or communicative, he did not succeed. At length one of the grooms entered the kitchen, and catching at a glance the nature of his occupation, the assumed beggar, still addressing the cook, commenced speaking of the horses and dogs which he had seen in the course of his wanderings, and repeating the praises he had heard bestowed upon those of Mr. Scott, which however he had never yet seen, although he knew all the finest horses in the neighboring counties. "Never seen master George's horses!" said the groom. "You don't belong to this part of the country, that is clear." "No," said the beggar, "but as I was passing along this way, I heard of the hospitality of your house and your fine stables, and you know a cat may look at a king, and I thought a poor fellow like me might get a look at a gen- tleman's fine horses, and have a crust in the bargain. The groom at Lord Darnley's used to say, that old Johnny-- that's me, Sir-knew nearly as much about horses as he did, and could judge their good points too. And there   136       WILLITOFT9, OR THE was Sir John Courtney, and Sir Henry Marsden, too, they have some fine horses." "Nothing like ours," said the groom; "Sir Henry hasn't a horse to equal our (black,' I know; and so you shall see for yourself, old boy. Come along and follow me to the stables." Old Johnny, as he called himself,'rose leisurely and ac- companied -the groom, who was anxious to win for his favorites the good opinion of one who boasted of being a judge although he was a beggar. Master Rodewell was no mean jockey, and soon satisfied the groom upon this point, and his judicious praise of the really fine animals won him the esteem of the man of the stable. "What a neck and head! Now, d'ye see, Sir John Courtney prides himself upon that point in his horses. I'd like him to see that bay there with the glossy coat. I really must tell Lord Darnley's man about that' Black!' What a noble animal. That must be master George's!" /i "Yes, that is his. And what do you think of Sir Hen- ry's horses beside him?" "By him? Ah-I would not like to say. His groom is a good friend of mine, and is your neighbor; he might hear of it, and I would not like to hurt his feelings." "Well, well," said the groom chuckling, "I see you are a judge of horse-flesh, and I won't make you fall out with your old friend. And hark you! you may stay here awhile if you like, and help the stable boys occasionally, and I will make you comfortable." "Thank you, thank you! But we beggars get indepen- dent and like our trade. We don't meet quite such good treatment now as in old times, only at the old houses like yours. But still I'll call here always in my rounds, and bring you the news and the latest receipts."   DAYS OF JAMBS I.       137 "Just as you choose. But you must take care, Johnny, to mention our horses occasionally." "That I will, to be sure, and about young master Scott, too. I hear he goes over to Sir Henry Marsden's pretty often, eh!" "Sir Henry's! not he, indeed. He goes to Willitoft," said the groom with a knowing wink. "Oho, sets the wind in that quarter?" said Rodewell: "Yes. Mr. Travers is a sort of relation," replied the groom, "' and so is Miss Julia. But it is a great pity they are papists, not that I care, God bless you! Mr. Travers is as generous and kind hearted a man as any in the country, but people might get into trouble ----" "Oh that's a mighty small matter, Sir; I assure you:" remarked the pretended beggar. "People don't trouble themselves about such things now." "Well, but the strangest thing is that Mr. William Scott goes over to Willitoft by himself so often. We don't know how to explain it. He looks so melancholy." "I'll tell you," said Rodewell, with a knowing wink. ' He has fallen in love with the pretty cousin, too." "Not a bit of it-ha, ha! what an idea! Master William in love! I could tell you something-I heard him mutter- ing one day as he gave me his horse all covered with foam, he had ridden him so hard from Willitoft." "Oh! don't tell me any secrets, I beg you; they are such dangerous things," said the beggar: "but I warrant you now its some Jesuit trick at bottom." "Ah! well you are cunning! What do you think he said? Why, as he got off his. horse, says he, half aloud, ' Yes, the Priest's right!' that's it." "Don't tell me, I say," exclaimed the beggar. 4 May be there's treason in it. Secrets are bad things. What does a '                     /   138       WILLITOFT, OR THE beggar want with secrets?" "Aha,"' he thought, "here's a thread-master George in love with a young papist, inter- feres to prevent a search of her father's house.. Master William comes hot from the same place and says, 'the priest is right.' Aha! A priest there concealed- a good reason for preventing a search, and a pretty sufficient of- fence for my purpose." "Treason! Nonsense! Do you think master William would have any thing to do with treason? No! no! it is not in the blood!" said the groom stoutly. "Ah well, what is a poor fellow like me to know about treason?" said the beggar. ",But does he go often to Wil- litoft!" "Why, do ye see, it's only lately: and he rides out alone, and we are not sure where he goes. Then, there's master George and his friend, Mr. Alton, who is going away soon, they often ride out together. Sometimes he goes with them and comes back long after them, and brings back books I    with him. Once or twice he brought very large books, old musty looking books." "Indeed, perhaps he is studying witchcraft!" said Rode- well, perceiving the leaning of the groom towards the mar- vellous, and determining to make use of him through his superstition. "Well!" he thought, "here is something more-master William borrows books, doubtless from this, concealed priest.-Now, I must see these books!"' The supposition which Rodewell had made, put an end to the communications of the groom, whose awe at the bare idea absorbed all other feelings. After a short pause,: Al    he said: "Do you really think, now, that he could be studying witchcraft?"   DAYS OF JAMES I.       139 "Perhaps he is," said the beggar. t"But, more probably, he is suffering from the spells of some of those Jesuits. They are terrible masters of the black art. I heard Lord Darnley's groom tell of one he saw hanged and drawn at, Tyburn, whose mouth spoke after his bowels were torn out and thrown into the fire. He said that the hangman gave him a receipt against their spells-for you know they can make themselves invisible and walk about where they please." "Is it possible?" said the groom uneasily. i  '"Pqssible! Yes, indeed; perhaps there is one listening to us now," replied the beggar. ; "Oh, Lord!" exclaimed the groom, starting and looking stealthily around. "And how do people get rid of them,? May be it is one of them that haunts master William, makes him look so wild and talk so, when you can see no one to talk to." "Listen, and I will tell you what to do if you would save your young master from being made- a Jesuit himself. I told you' I had a charm-here it is," and he drew from his pocket a small package of white powder which he hap- pened to have about him-"I must get into his room for five minutes by myself. There I will scatter some of this powder, and if a Jesuit be there, it will make him visible and we shall catch him." "Come, then," said the simple groom eagerly. "Mas- ter William is now absent, and you shall go to his room at once." The willing dupe and the cunning officer now entered the house by a private stairway, and, after ascending several flights of steps, paused before the door of William Scott's apartments. After a moment's observation, they entered quietly. The room was a dressing room, connected with a   "O       WrLULtor, On TH  chamber and a closet, the doors of which were slightly ajar, In the centre of the room stood a table, oh which were heaped books, manuscripts and drawings in great confu- sion. On the floor of the room, were negligently scattered, as if unused, various books which the pursuivant examined. They afforded him no satisfaction-being only classical works, mingled with the choicest productions of the day. No where, in the outer room, could the astute officer detect the evidence which he was seeking. "Perhaps it is better," thought he, "I shall find them in the oratory; and if I do, their concealment is another fact to aid me." Turning his steps to the little closet, followed by the groom, he threw the door open, and, oh!-horror! how deeply groaned the poor groom, expect- ing every moment to see a live Jesuit start up before him as the beggar scattered the powder on the floor.--Horror! there was a little table fashioned like an altar, on which was raised a cross of rough wood, supporting a scroll with ^I   the letters I. N. R. 1. and a rude crown of thorns, made of twigs of the crab tree. Upon the table rested a single book.-It was a Latin Missal. On the floor, at the foot of the table, were piled several Catholic controversial works and rare folios of the writings of the Fathers and the de- crees of the Councils. "There! do you not see how far gone he is?" exclaimed the beggar. "This is all the work of the Jesuit." "Oh! my poor master William, and he was so good and I5   kind to every body! And now what will become of him? They will make a papist of him." "Yes: and then he will be hung, drawn and quartered. I will tell you how to prevent this. You see the Jesuit is not in this room or the spell would have made him appear.    DAYS OF JAMES I.       141 But you must swear to keep this a secret from all except such as I shall name." "I swear it," said the groom. "Now I will help you to catch this Jesuit and then Mr. William will be perfectly free." "Indeed," said the groom, " then it shall not be my fault if he escape." "You must take this book,"-continued Rodewell, rapidly maturing in his mind a plan to secure the groom, and, as he spoke, laying his finger upon a work in defence of the Pope's Supremacy. "You must take this book to Under- wood and ask at the hostelry for a man named John Foxly. He is a wonderful man in his way, and by having a book like that which came from this Jesuit, he will be able to find him out. When you give it to him, only say this- 'Use this well, and learn the truth;!' I must go now-but I will see you to-morrow again." The two then left the room, the pursuivant having made a careful examination for further purposes, while the groom carried with him the book which had been designated by his companion. Descending unobserved, they separated; and the beggar having renewed his injunctions on the groom to do his mission at Underwood on the following day, turned his steps towards the hills. No sooner had the disguised pursuivant reached a point at which he was no longer visible from Scottsfield, than he changed his course and hastened towards the village, satisfied with the progress that he had made. Changing his dress and concealing his disguise in a secure place, he walked leisurely into the ham- let and entered the hostelry of master Giles Horstead. John Foxly had not yet returned, and the chief pursui- vant, having drawn a portfolio from his travelling case, sat down to record the discoveries he had made and the evi-   "2       WILLITOFT, OR THE dence he had collected. An hour passed in this occupa- tion, and the twilight began to descend ere the chief was interrupted by his subordinate. - "Ha! master Foxly," he said gaily, as he closed the book before him, "Ha! master Foxly, what tidings bear ye? Take heed now or I will surpass you." "If you do, then, master Rodewell, my father gave me a wrong name-for stranger tidings mortal never heard." "Ah! begin then," interrupted Rodwell, re-opening his book and taking up a pen to note whatever might prove useful. "Well," said Foxly, "Edward Hurlstone has turned papist." "So I suspected, John Foxly," said the pursuivant coolly. "Now for your facts-facts!" "I went to Hurlstone's. Ned was in his room alone; the same room -in which we found him when first we saw him there --" "When his brother so suspiciously delayed permitting you to enter," interrupted Rodewell." "Yes," continued Foxly. "I soon brought the subject round, and, from his humor, I found I might come to it boldly. So, I asked him to join us in catching a papist, or rather proving an overt act upon a suspected papist. He became excited and told me to begone; that it was infa- mous to do such things: and, when I reminded him of his former skill in the business, he wept bitterly and said he had prayed God to forgive him for his sins, and he fervently hoped that penance had washed away his guilt." "Penance"--repeated Rodewell, noting down the facts as he spoke, "penance means confession and absolution, before any judge and jury in England, and it is enough to prove master Ned Hurlstone a relapsed papist. So our   DAYS OF JAMES I.       143 old friend will sing or swing. Well, what more have you learned?" "He refused to listen to any proposition, and then, as if suspecting my design, suddenly became silent, and I could get no further words from him. As I left him, my eye rested on this, which I managed to bring away unobserved." And the officer held out a ribbon to which was attached a case of silk in the shape of a heart, with the symbol of a lamb and cross embroidered upon it. "Ha! an Agnus Dei!" said Rodewell, taking it in his hand and examining it. "Now, master Hurlstone you are safe." "And now, what think you of my tidings?" "That you have flown at your game right well. But I have stricken a higher and a richer quarry." "Indeed, and what may that be?" "Heed you not that, master Foxly. But to-morrow you shall aid me in taking another step towards success. You have one man in your power, you must have another." And he related only so much of his adventures of the even- ing as would enable Foxly to play the part assigned to him on the following morning. "Now, master John, I wish to ponder on these things alone," said the pursuivant as he closed his story. "Well, master Rodewell, you play the superior well- one would take you for a gentleman born and bred! I go," he said, seeing an impatient frown on his comrade's face, and left the room. "Play the superior! Ha! Shall I only play it, and so contemptibly as this?" exclaimed Rodewell, striding across the floor. "Shall I play, it? No: I feel the power within me: he felt it. or he would not'have marked the difference between us. I am not born to remain a down-trodden i[   "4       WILLITOFT, OR THE menial-a cur to hunt out papists. Pah! what care I for these poor, oppressed people or their creed-so by them I rise. They are the means to my end, and through them I will reach wealth, station, power. I have struggled long for that end-others have snatched away the rewards by superior cunning.-Now I see that prospect, brightening before me. Difficulties are in the way. They bust be over- come. Men whose lives-bah! that is only a difficulty- and our goodly laws, where rightly managed, can remove many a worse than that!" For a long time mused this dark, unscrupulous man, upon whose heart the demon of ambition had seized, never to leave it but with life. At length he- cast himself upon a chair, exclaiming, "It shall be mine! I loved the spot the moment that my eyes first rested on it. A secret instinct told me it was destined for me. One son, a papist newly converted; the other, about to marry a papist, and already guilty of protecting her father and baffling the officers of justice! Success! It shall be mine. The gold of this foolish knight shall pave the way for my grant, and then, and then-- " and he again sank-into a deep and silent reverie. On the, following morning, master Rodewell dressed him- self with more than ordinary care and seemed not a little of a gentleman, in outward bearing, so well did he ape the manners of that class he aspired to reach, and he prepared his little room for the scene which was to be enacted in it. A large chair was placed in a magisterial position before a table on which was spread books and papers in frigid order. Scarcely had he finished his preparations when Foxly an- nounced that the groom was approaching the house. "When he addresses you and delivers you the book, make a great outcry, seize him at once and bring him in."   DAYS OF JAMES I.       145 Foxly"left the room, and, in a few minutes, Rodewell heard him exclaim- in a loud and, angry voice, "Villain! What is this you offer me? Gracious Heaven, a book in defence of the Supremacy of the Pope! Here, host! Treason, treason! help, Giles Horstead!"Then a violent struggle, and cries for mercy, and in a few seconds John Foxly, his face glowing with pretended indignation, burst into the room dragging the affrighted groom by the collar, while Giles Horstead, pale and red by turns, fol- lowed pushing on the groom while the eye of Foxly was upon him, and drawing back when he looked another -way --afraid of the officer, and dreading the loss of the custom from Scottsfield. "What's this? What's this? John Foxly are you mad?" "Mad indeed! Master Rodewell. I would not wonder if I were!" exclaimed Foxly violently. "Look you, mas- ter Rodewell, you are the greatest priest catcher in the kingdom, and I am your chief assistant, and together we have hung at least a score of papist emissaries." "Well, John Foxly, that's all true," said Rodewell coolly. "And we shall hang some more I hope, before the year is out." "' Oh Lord! Oh Lord!" sobbed the affrighted groom. "Look at that book," continued Foxly indignantly. "What do you mean, John Foxly? Why, Sir, this is a hanging matter. Was this book found on that man?" "Oh! your honor, I ain't a papist!" exclaimed the groom clasping his hands. "Found on him! Look you, no! But he came up to me-to me, and giving me the book said ' Use this well and learn the truth.' " "Why this is a capital offence!" said Rodewell solemnly, arising from his chair and casting a searching look upon 13 e   "6       WILLITOFT, OR THE -the poor groom. "Do you dare, villain, to disseminate such books as this, knowing that the penalty thereof is death? Do you dare to insult the laws by seeking to corrupt the officers of justice, to induce them to withdraw their alle- giance from their lawful king and give it to a foreign prince, -and that prince the Pope! You, no papist! Villain, con- fess your crime straightway, or a death of torture is your fate!" "Mercy, mercy! I am innocent! I am innocent!" shriek- ed the affrighted groom, casting himself upon his knees before that dreadful man, whose name was the terror of the whole country side far and near, "I am innocent.-It was the beggar who told me to do it." "Beggar! what do you mean?" said Rodewell sternly. "Do you trifle with me, sirrah?" "Pardon, your honor! It was the beggar who gave me the book and told me to take it to John Foxly at the inn here, and tell him to profit by it!" said the groom with trembling lips. "Fool, you have become the instrument of some Jesuit in disguise, if what you say be true; but that it is not. You cannot deceive me. I have heard such stories told by half the emissaries we have yet arrested." "Indeed, indeed, it is true! I am a good Protestant! Am I not, master Horstead, good master Giles? Ah, if ever I catch that cursed beggar --" "Sure," said honest Giles, blenching under the stern look of the pursuivant, ( I used to think so-but in these times no one knows: Jesuits are about, and many persons are becoming papists." C"Right, mine host, don't consort with such traitors, or you will put your neck into a halter," said the pursuivant. Giles Horstead instinctively loosened his crav'at with his   hand, and gasped for breath, as if an imaginary halter were already tightening around his fat gullet. "As for you," continued the pursuivant to the victim, ( nothing can save you from the gallows. You must be tried; you will be con- demned; you will be hung by the neck, cut down before you are dead, your bowels torn out and cast into the fire; and thus you die by slow degrees. So perish all traitors." "Mercy! mercy! I am no traitor, I am innocent!" ex- claimed the groom, wild with feai and horror, at the awful spectacle which the pursuivant had brought before his eyes with such terrible minuteness. "Perhaps, master Rodewell, you can do something for this poor fellow, if he would recant and confess his crime. He seems penitent," said John Foxly. "Nonsense, Foxly, how can I? You know my orders are to bring all offenders to trial: and if I aid in conceal- ing an offence, I am particeps criminis, an accessory after the fact: and this fellow's offence is so glaring that he must be convicted without the jury's leaving the box. Read the title of the book: 'In Defence of the Supremacy of the Pope '----" 'But I did not know it, I cannot read," cried the groom eagerly. The pursuivant shook his head and said, "Your own words are against you. I must end this." And he took up a blank warrant signed by Sir Henry Marsden and commenced to fill it. "Master Rodewell," again interrupted Foxly, " it seems to me you can save this poor fellow if you will, and I will ask it as a favor." The groom listened with his lips glued together, and his eyes turning from one to the other, like those of a madman.  "How can I do it John?"     /I   148       WILLITOFT, OR THE "You know you are entitled to select any of these emis- saries and enrol them as your spies, and then protect them by reason of public policy." "True, John Foxly, true," replied the pursuivant, paus- ing and lifting the pen as if in meditation, " but how can I trust an offender like this?" "Oh, Sir, I will be a spy; good Sir, I will do any thing you may command, only save me from being burnt, hanged, drawn and quartered!" ciied the victim, who had nothing of the martyr in his character, shuddering at the idea of those terrible scenes, then by no means the uncommon fate of the persecuted Catholics. "{ Perhaps it may be done. Master Horstead, what is the character of this man? Has he been considered honest?" "Why, Sir," said mine host, "he was always thought so till this time --- " "Well, that is something," continued Rodewell. "But, fellow, how can I appoint you a spy when your secret is known to Giles Horstead, here. Once it be known you are a spy, and you can learn'nothing, do nothing." "Master Giles will keep it a secret," said the groom, imploringly.. "Yes, yes," said the host, " that I will." "I would advise you to do so," said Rodewell sternly: "for if you divulge it, his majesty's judges would consider it in the light of an interference with the course of justice, and would punish it severely, as giving aid and information and countenance to papists and Jesuits--the king's ene- mies,-which is a high crime. You understand, master Giles!" "Y-e-s," stuttered mine host, growing very pale under the look of the pursuivant. "I will never say a word- not one -- "   "Then you may leave the room, Giles," said the pursui- vant; and the host hastened to avail himself of the permis- sion, cursing the fate that had sent such troublesome guests to his house. "And now, sirrah, if I consent to save you," said Rode- well to the groom, " what can I expect to learn through you? Where did you get this book? Who gave it to you? Answer truly, and mark me, you must swear to all your replies, and if you dare to equivocate now, or even attempt to deceive me, I will hang you as sure as there is a heaven above!-First, your name?" continued the pursuivant open- ing his book of informations. "John Sliike, Sir." "Where do you live?" "At Scottsfield." "John Slike, groom, in the employ of Mr. Scott, near Underwood-secret agent," said the, pursuivant, reading what he had written. "Now for the book?" "I got it from the beggar," said the groom hesitating, for he dreaded to betray his master. "Villain, do you dare to equivocate?" "The beggar told me to take it." "; Whence did you take it?"For a moment the groom again hesitated: but the cunning officer coolly took up the unfinished warrant, saying: "This trifling must end." * Now all hesitation was over. Rather than see that fear- ful warrant filled up, the miserable wretch would have be- trayed father and mother and every thing on earth. The pursuivant had judged him rightly. "I found it in master William Scott's room, where I took the beggar --" "Fool! do you still talk of that beggar? I say there was no beggar. It was your master in disguise, who gave 13*    l; i \150       WILLITOFT, OR THE the book to you, that you might, by means of it, corrupt this faithful officer, master Foxly, and thus put an end to the inquiries he was making after suspected papists in this country."  "Ah!" muttered the groom, "any thing but being hung, drawn and quartered.-Yes," he continued aloud, " per- haps it was so!" "I tell you it was so," said the pursuivant fiercely; and then in a rapid manner he questioned his victim, writing- down as he proceeded such a deposition as he wished him to make, and then read it to him somewhat in the follow- ing form: '"John Slike, groom, &c--being duly sworn, &c.--de- poseth and sayeth that he received a certain treasonable book, in defence of the Supremacy of the Pope of Rome, from his master, William Scott, who disguised as a beggar, in order to baffle legal inquiry, took him to his room, where- in he showed him certain superstitious and idolatrous Ro- mish things, such as an altar and a crown of thorns on a cross; and then and there gave him the said book to deli- ver to, and to corrupt, one John Foxly and make the said John Foxly, he being then a true and lawful subject and holding true allegiance to the king, withdraw his said alle- giance from the king, and conspiring to dethrone'and as- sassinate his majesty and to procure the acknowledgment of the Supremacy of the Pope of Rome, in these his ma. jesty's dominions; and that his said master, William Scott, did receive the said book according to the best of his know- ledge and belief from a certain Jesuit, harboring at Willi- toft, the house of one James Travers, a concealed papist--" "You said a Jesuit harbored there?" said the officer, pausing.   DAYS OF JAMES I.      151   "No Sir! I said there was a singular old schoolmaster there. I had heard--" "A Jesuit!" repeated the pursuivant with a frown. "Lord, Sir.-Yes. A Jesuit."--"Any thing but hang- ing and burning," he said mentally. "A concealed papist," continued the pursuivant reading the deposition, "and harborer of popish priests, to whose house his said master was in the habit of going often alone; and that his said master had said in his presence that the Jesuits were right, meaning as this deponent understood, that the popish religion was the true religion, and that the King of England was a heretic and an usurper and might lawfully be killed, and endeavoring to seduce this deponent to aid in such diabolical and Jesuitical conspiracy." "Sir!" said the groom; but the words died away upon his lips as he caught the meaning glance of the pursuivant fixed lupon him. . "You shall make your mark to this, and John Foxly shall witness it. At a proper time you shall make oath to the truth of its contents." "Yes, Sir:" said the groom, muttering as he followed the directions of the officer: "Any thing but being burnt, hanged, drawn, and quartered." "There! that will do," said the pursuivant as the victim made his mark. "If you ever attempt to vary your story, I shall be unable to place any reliance upon you, and must at once hand you over to the Courts, and you can guess your fate." "Hanged, drawn and quartered-ugh!"--shuddered the groom. "You will go back to Mr. Scott's and observe your mas- ter's doings; and bring me a faithful account to-morrow night of whatever you may hear. If you have any thing   152   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I. important to relate, I will even reward you for your zeal in the king's service. If he go to Willitoft, you will follow him if possible, and observe him closely. I have no doubt there is a conspiracy on foot against the life of the king as you say----" "I?" said the hapless groom. "Yes, you have said it; and if you aid in preserving the life of his blessed majesty, and in detecting the conspira- tors, you will not only be pardoned, but well rewarded. But, if you do not, the law must take its course, and then- may the Lord have mercy on your soul!" "Hanged, drawn, burnt and quartered"--muttered the craven victim.--"No, never'! any thing, but that." "You may go now, but beware!"   CHAPTER     IX.

"Aye, but the worm will turn and sting-so the proverb sayeth. But, master Rodewell, these cringing wretches are those we  live by. If all were like you and me, we could E find neither food nor raiment." "We   are the hawks, you would say-well, I suppose God made it so. There is a hawk which pursues and strikes the timid dove, there, is a hawk, which pounces on the do- mestic hen. There is a  hawk that preys on each tender and unresisting bird. It seems as if nature had destined each defenceless creature to be the prey of somethingo which she has made strong, and brave, and cunning.

We are but fulfilling our destiny."   154       WILLITOFT, OR THE "Bravo! what a philosopher you are, master Rodewell. No doubt you are right. But that poor devil was well managed. He would sell his own brother." "He is mine body and soul, mine; and I will make him aid on to a glorious success! But now for a man of differ- ent mould. We have enough evidence to commit Hurl- stone and his family. You have failed to secure him, and he must perish. He knows our plans, and, if permitted to go at large, will thwart them. Besides, when we have him, his conversion will be a strong reason for energetic mea- sures against the papists; and we must stir up the bigotry of the populace if we wish to succeed." "That is plain enough." "Well, take this warrant, which I have just filled up, and arrest him at once, with all the inmates of the house. You can get the constabulary force here. In the mean while, I will go to Sir Henry Marsden, prepare him for the case, and await you there. By the way, be secret about to-day's affair: that poor devil of a groom will profit us if we work him right." "I go, my lord, it is a pleasure to obey so good a mas- ter, and one so quick withal and full of schemes," said the assistant pursuivant, laughingly as he departed. "My-lord!-Ah well, these hopes,-how still they soar! Why may I not be Sir Edward Rodewell? It sounds as noble as Sir Henry Marsden.--A reward earned for State- services, better earned at worst than many a higher title given to graceful pimps and noble psha! I have done the State some service---for myself-and my own ends-! Who would have thought this morning how rapidly one short hour would hurry me on to the accomplishment of all my hopes? And now to use a villain for my ends: your pardon, Sir Henry, a gentle villain!"    DAYS OF JAMES I.       1.5 In a few moments, the pursuivant was dashing towards the seat of the good knight, with tidings which he knew would secure him a hearty reception. Giving his horse to a groom, the pursuivant entered the hall, and was shown to the library where sat Sir Henry Marsden, who motioned him to a chair. "Well, master Rodewell, I hope you bring me good tidings. Though evil tidings fly swift, and you, I judge, have ridden fast." "Ah, but Sir Henry, I bear good tidings. Inclination as well as duty have prompted me to speed in your service." "Well be your acts but as fair as your speech," said the the knight with a slight sneer, "and our difficulties will in- deed vanish rapidly. But what of your tidings?" "I despatched one of my trustiest agents, yesterday, to carry out. the plan you suggested, about Hurlstone, whilst I myself having learned that the Scotts were connected at Willitoft, set about to corrupt one of their servants for in- formation. We have both been tolerably successful. 1 have secured the means of watching Willitoft from that side; and my man has insured the fate of Hurlstone. Your surmise was right,-he has become a- pervert, and, as he suspects our plans, must be put out of the way. I have directed him to be arrested and brought hither before you for examination. I hope I have done well," he added sub- missively, as he saw a frown gathering on the brow of the knight. "Doubtless you have acted for the best-but it seems to me hastily done. Let it pass; it only brings the affair to a crisis somewhat sooner than I expected." "In that, Sir Henry, I hope I have met the wishes you expressed a few days ago :" and Rodewell related particur larly the knowledge he had obtained concerning Hurlstone. X,   4      156       WILLTTOFT, OR THE "At all events, then," said the knight, "this step could not have been avoided. I feel sure there is a priest harbor- ing at Willitoft, and were he apprised of the conversation of your man with Hurlstone, he would make his escape before we could obtain the evidence to convict the family of sheltering him. You may as well prepare the papers in the matter, 'as we will of course commit them all. I have some matters here which will occupy my attention until the arrival of the officers." Rodewell soon made out the necessary papers-but Sir Henry continued to write, and examine his books and ac- counts, heedless of the movements of the pursuivant, who, now to occupy his time, took down a book from the shelves and opened it. Little did he read within its pages, for in the place, where the book opened to his hand, a paper met his eye, on which was written "Willitoft acres-an- nual rent -, adjoins the' lands of Housewell, at the Holly tuft, and runs thence by and with the line of said land two miles, admirably situated for union of the two into one estate-which would be one of the largest and richest in the country. Its owner a papist--lands may be confis- cated-and bought in, if rightly proceeded in," &c. Then followed some suggestions of plans not yet matured for bringing about this desirable result. Rising from his seat and carelessly approaching the recess of a window, he con- cealed the paper in his pocket. The estate of Sir Henry Marsden bore the name of Housewell, and here in his own hand-writing was the record of Sir Henry's secret ambition. Then Rodewell sat down and began to meditate on his own hopes,.his own projects, in which he was busied until the noise occasioned by the arrival of a number of persons at the hall door aroused him from his reverie. In a moment more, in obedience to a command which the baronet had    DAYS OF JAMES I.       157 given to the servant who announced their arrival, John Foxly and his assistant constables from Underwood, enter- ed the room with the prisoners-John Hurlstone, Mary, and the elder brother. The poor wife, pale and trembling, clung to her hus- band's arm, while he seemed weighed down by the burden of her sorrows, rather than his own. At times, he bent down and whispered consolation in her ear. His lips were compressed, his cheeks a little pale, but his eye shone out firmly and clearly:-there was no coward fear at his heart. The elder brother bore upon his features the pallor of recent illness, his frame was bowed, his eye half closed and bent upon the earth, and a slight shudder seemed ever and anon to shake his frame. Thus the three prisoners stood ranged before the seat of the baronet, who at length turned his piercing eyes upon them. "Hurlstone, I regret to sep you brought here thus; you who were once so faithf1/and obedient to the laws, and dutiful to the king. It grieves me much to see you now in bonds, charged with a high offence against the laws, the punishment of which is death." A deep groan broke from the breast of the convalescent. "I rejoice," continued the magistrate, " to hear that evidence of repentance-perhaps there is hope for you yet." "Bear up, bear up! and God help you, Edward," said the younger Hurlstone earnestly. "Silence, sirrah!" exclaimed the baronet impatiently. "Do you dare to encourage your brother in his contumacy, and that in the presence of this Court? Beware!" 'f Oh, John, be still! Do not offend his honor, and he will discharge us. We are poor harmless people, Sir Henry,-Oh, you will not ruin us!" sobbed out poor Mary Hurlstone. "   158       WILLITQT, OR THE -"Hurlstone,", continued the magistrate, "I have been compelled by a severe sense of duty to have you brought before me. Your conduct has lately been subject to much suspicion. It still depends upon you to free yourself from the charge, and perhaps to explain all, these circumstances which now weigh so heavily against you. The offence with which you are accused is, that you have. become reconciled with the, Church of Rome, by the agency of a priest or other popish emissary:- in one word--you are a relapsed papist. An open confession and a full information, may save you and these unfortunate people, your brother and sister, whom you have involved in your crime and its fatal consequences." The shaft was well and truly aimed, and it pierced the heart of that silent, dowtn stricken man. He raised his eyes, fixed them for a moment upon that younger brother whom in childhood -he had loved and guarded,-who had been committed to his care by his dying parents,-and whose, life now hung upon his accents,-upon that bro- ther's wife who clung to the life of her life, tearful, sorrow- ful, speechless. His lips opened; but the words choked in the utterance, and he shook his head mournfully and sighed. "God strengthen thee, Edward-Mary, Mother, pray for him for he is weak!" exclaimed John Hurlstone, sadly and earnestly. ' Speak, Edward Hurlstone!" said the inexorable baron- et, unmoved by the mournful silence of the elder or the manly firmness of the younger brother, untouched by the mute but eloquent tears of the young wife. "Speak! One word will save yourself and those who must suffer for you. You are silent! Be it so! Approach John- Foxly!" The officer was sworn and detailed his evidence rapidly   )DAYS OF JAJ&ES I.      159 and succinctly. The prisoner, Edward Hurlstone, had been one of their band, had been sent down to this part of the country on some business, had found refuge in his brother's house in sickness, so he had told the witness; then he had quit them, refused to hold communication with them, and had declared to witness that he had done penance for his past crimtes against the priests. "That of course means, confession and absolution!" said master Rodewell, who acted as clerk to Sir Henry. "Certainly," replied Sir Henry, " set it down so." " In coming away," continued. Foxly, "I found this in Hurlstone's room." And he produced the Agnus Dei, be- fore spoken of. "Ha!" exclaimed Sir Henry. "Do you not know the statute against the introduction of beads and Agnus Deus, and other popish and superstitious devices? I think no other evidence is required to authorize me to commit these people." "It is very clear, Sir Henry," said Rodewell. "But, Hurlstone," said Sir Henry, whose chief object was to obtain evidence against the inhabitants of Willitoft, "t-on account of your old companion, master Rodewell, who has done me some service, I will pass you into his hands-perhaps he can induce you to save your brother's family and yourself. As your guilt is proven, it only needs an open and full confession to save them from ruin and death-as you know very well from your own experience in these matters, that the harborers of reconciled papists are subjected to the same fatal penalties." The sickly hue fled from the face of the elder Hurlstone, but the color as quickly vanished again; and his cheek be- came almost livid, while that fearful shudder ran through his frame again, and in a low voice he said,   160       WILLITOFT, OR THE "I will speak, Sir Henry. Perhaps I may save them. Life to me is nothing-but that they should perish for me!" -and he groaned aloud. "Oh God! give him strength to resist this last tempta- tion," exclaimed John Hurlstone. "Hush! Hush, John, dear John, he will save us," whis- pered the pale woman at his side--almost hysterically.- s Hush, he will save us now!" "Woman," said her husband sternly, "is life worth apos- tacy and falsehood? Go!" Oh, no nono, my husband, not for me; but for you--you and our children. Oh! he may save us without that," said the poor young mother, weeping for her lost babes. "Then, pray that he may be strengthened; that the holy Mother may take him under her care," said the husband firmly. "Mistrust me not, brother, but pray for me," said Ed- ward Hurlstone, sadly, as he raised his head for the first time and looked full upon his judge. "I will speak, Sir Henry. It is fit that I should. I owe it to myself, to these poor children who now suffer for me; still more I owe it to my God! It is true, as that man has said, that I was one of those blood-hounds, who live by hunting down the in- nocent and holy servants of God: and it is true that God, in his ineffable mercy, has given me the grace to become shocked-at the monstrous iniquity of my life. I have fore- sworn it! I have done penance for those crimes-Oh, so dark do they now appear, that I feel that nothing that I can do or suffer, can wash out their horrid stain---" and that painful shudder again convulsed his frame. "Fool!" exclaimed Rodewell fiercely-but his blanched cheek and livid lip proved another feeling even in his hard- ened heart. i   DAYS OF JAMES I.       161 "Sir Henry, my story is ended. I have sinned and have determined to repent all my days, in tears and sorrow. These children are innocent before God.-They are chil- dren to me in years, and he was left by our father to me as a child in my care.-How have I fulfilled that guardianship! God help me! If in the eyes of men they are judged guilty, and shall suffer, it will be another death-pang to my heart for my sins. Sir Henry I was born a Catholic, and with the grace of God I will die a Catholic!"And the head of the sick man sank down again upon his breast, the fire that for a moment lit up his sunken eye grew dim, his cheek became pallid once more, and that convulsive shudder shook his weak frame tremulously. "My brother, my brother! May the God of heaven bless thee!" exclaimed young Hurlstone joyfully. How sadly sobbed that mother's breaking heart. "Alas, my children, my husband!" Oh the fury of that stern, dark man, bearded and baffled thus by his victim, even in the presence of his menials, his power scorned and his hopes of discovery baffled! "Hark you, sirrah! You have seen the thumb-screw wring out their secret from the most contumacious! You have helped to turn the rack that tore apart the wounded limbs of silent criminals!-Beware! Once committed to to the county jail, and I will wring out this secret from you or you shall die under the torture!" The Hurlstones were silent, while motionless and speech- less the poor wife gazed wildly upon her husband. "Woman," said Rodewell gently, "you can save your husband and yourself. I think, if you will give information so that this priest may be discovered, I can safely promise you a pardon and instant release to return to your sweet children and happy home: otherwise you must be taken to "4   162       WILLITOPT, OR THE the county prison-your husband will be put to the torture and your children will be given to some good Protestant to be educated in the religion of the English Church." "Oh, my children, my children!" cried the distracted mother; "will you tear them from me? they who have clung to my breast and been nourished from my veins?" "Tyrants, be merciful for once and let our children die martyrs with us-but pervert them not!" exclaimed John Hurlstone hoarsely. "Oh my children, would that they had died before this day came upon us!" "Away with the prisoners," exclaimed Sir Henry hastily. "Away with them, constables!"And turning away, he walked towards the window. "These scenes are exceed- ingly unpleasant, Rodewell," he said as soon as the prison- ers had been removed, "but by G---, I will break down that bull-dog pertinacity of the Hurlstones. That younger fellow has the courage of a -"  "Martyr, Sir Henry! Yes, he will die game," interrupted Rodewell. "Die! Think you we must proceed to this extremity with these poor devils. I dare say, a few months imprison- ment will bring them to their senses: they are too unim- portant to suffer." "True, Sir Henry, but policy will render it needful: otherwise if higher and richer suffer, and these escape, the evil disposed and the malicious might surmise that justice was not the object held in view, but some ulterior ends." "True, master Rodewell, that did not occur to me,'" said the baronet; and for a few moments he paced silently across the room. "Ah, he will crush every hunian being that stands be- tween himself and Willitoft," thought Rodewell.   DAY S OF JAMES I.       163 Suddenly the baronet paused.--"Did not the woman speak of children? Where are they? Perhaps their being at large may frustrate the design we had in view in arrest- ing the family." For a moment the pursuivant hesitated, then he said, "I know not, Sir Henry; but even if they do escape, it seems probable that they will take refuge at Willitoft, and this it- self will aid our project." "It was an oversight, master Rodewell. Let them be sought out, and bound to some good Protestant to be in- structed in the faith of the Church of England." "It shall be done, Sir Henry." "And now for the next step, what counsel you?" "To compass Willitoft with spies: for as -yet we have brought nothing home to the inmates. What we have done is secure, but we must connect it with them." "Tender them the oaths," said Sir Henry. "They would refuse them, and suffer simply the penalties imposed therefor. We must convict them of something deeper. If this fool, Hurlstone, had informed, I am satis- fied we should have had all the evidence necessary for our purpose." "Then Hurlstone shall inform!" exclaimed Sir Henry. "I will have him put to the torture. That old puritan devil, Holdfast Lockson, who is in the commission the Lord knows why or how, will be the very instrument I want. He is a fanatic and will serve with a gusto in such matters." "I think, Sir Henry, you will find torture insufficient. Hurlstone is not the man to yield. We must bring some other plan to our aid." "At all events I will have it tried. Lockson will screw it out. By the way, would it not be well to communicate with Government on the subject? I think we can make  !   164       WILLITOFT, OR THE out a case which will occupy their attention. I have drawn up statements of certain suspicious affairs, and these facts which you have ferreted out will make a very good conclu- sion to them. I think it would be useful.. I will finish the report, and you will find me a person of trust to bear it." "I am at your service, Sir Henry, for whatever you may design. I agree with you as to the propriety of the step you propose, and will undertake to have your package de- livered. Indeed, I regret that the state of affairs here ren- ders it impossible for me to take that duty upon myself. I could be of use there, understanding fully the state of the case, and your untiring energy in the public service. But, then, my supervision is needed here, I fear " "Let me see"-said Sir Henry, "would it not be better to delay the arrest for some days?" "Pardon me, Sir Henry," replied Rodewell, "it appears to me more prudent to wait until we can arrest Mr. Travers and his family upon effective charges, before we communi- cate with Government. It will then assume a more impor- tant aspect, and I can well be spared to carry the statements myself. eIn the meanwhile, through friends in London, I will by certain rumors prepare the way for any catastrophe." -"Aye, my Mentor, my sage counsellor, you are worth your weight in gold. Doubtless a conspiracy will be heard of, eh?--innumerable conversions by the intrigues of the Jesuits, et id genus omne,--until the good people there, will every day expect to see an army of bloody papists marching triumphantly through the city gates-ha! ha!" "Oh, Sir Henry! only speak of a pack or two of pocket pistols found secreted,* and you will have the whole popu- lation in terror, firmly believing that the entire Protestant * Such rumors as these were often currently believed with no better foundation, in that day.   DAYS OF JAMES I.       165 nation is to be privately assassinated: and add a few cases of matchlocks, and bundles of pikes deposited in conve- nient places, Madame Rumor will have you an insurrection ready to break out, and commit you as many midnight mur- ders and outrages as you can desire, in an hour's time: troops will soon be marching;--and, thereafter the heads of the suspected will fall under the axe, like corn before the sickle: Rich will be the reward of the fortunate men who have given the nation the delightful fever of an excit' ing alarm! What a glorious country it is, Sir Henry, for a skilful man to thrive in!" Sir Henry smiled as he saw the way to the gratification of his wishes thus opened by the hints of the wily pursui- vant, whose plan was in that day as feasible, nay as certain of success if well conducted, as, at this period, it would be considered wild and chimerical. An ignorant populace, stirred to frenzy by the bigotry of the ministers of their re- ligion, who should have been the first to calm their pas- sions and to purify their hearts, by holding up to them the forbearing gentleness of the divine master whom they pro- fessed to follow, were ever ready to believe the wildest fic- tions which it pleased the designing to invent against the hated and proscribed Catholics. They knew and felt that the Catholics were cruelly persecuted, and they believed that they would in turn have recourse to any means to seek vengeance on their oppressors,-for even the worm will turn to sting the foot that tramples on it. Thus agitated by constant rumors, and excited by their own fears, they were ready to submit to usurpations of power on the part of the Government which in Catholic days would have been resisted with the sword. The Government fed the insane passion of the people, and amused them with burning and hanging priests and laymen at Tyburn, while it robbed them   166       WILLITOFT, OR THE of the freedom which their fathers had maintained in many a struggle with the Crown. The beginning of the Refor- mation saw the power of the nobles decline: they had been the guardians of the liberty of the nation, and when they had become impotent against the sovereign, the power of the King and the power of the Commons must have come into conflict: and the power of the Commons would have triumphed. But the Commons threw themselves into the hands of the Crown, and the Reformation made the last of the Tudors and the first of the Stuarts more absolute than the great kings of the Plantagenet line had ever been, when surrounded by their steel-clad barons and their sturdy yeomen who were as ready to cry "bills and bows" against the encroachments of the sovereign, as against the ranks of a foreign foe. The struggle between the Crown and the Commons was thus postponed: the Government saw that it could be thus postponed, and it was content to feed the fanaticism of the people with fire and blood. Thea struggle came at last, and the Commons triumphed, but it required the murder of one king, the exile of two others, the proscription of the Royal line, and the introduction of a foreign prince into the throne which had been filled by princes of British blood from the days of the Conquest, And the Commons only triumphed when that same spirit of fanaticism, which had enabled the Crown to trample up- on the rights of the Commons, had been turned against the Crown by the leaders of the Commons. The Government had kindled this fanaticism; and when the Government sought to quench it, by extending toleration to the Catho- lics it was withered by the flame. Sir Henry smiled as he pondered over the hints of the pursuivant; and Rodewell smiled as he saw how eagerly   DAYS OF JAMES I.       167 Sir Henry threw himself into his trap and prepared to make himself the mere partner in a base conspiracy. "But, master Rodewell," said the baronet, suddenly changing his manner, " enough of this jesting-for these are perilous jests and turning truth to ridicule. The sad reality we have before us, is bad enough in good sooth. Though, I should not wonder that, when known in Lon- don, the danger should be magnified. Be it your care to counteract all such evil rumors and to lessen all unneces- sary alarm." "Oh! trust me for that," replied the wily pursuivant with a knowing glance. "But many's the true word said in jest. I would not be surprised if there were such arms concealed in this neighborhood for horrid and treasonable purposes. Rumors are rife of such preparations in the North-that hot-bed of insurrection; I know many places that would seem likely to be selected for such a purpose-in the hills behind Willitoft, for instance. And,%now that the idea has occurred to me, I feel it my duty to cause a careful search to be made," continued the officer. The baronet paused in his walk and, turning towards the pursuivant, looked into his face to read his meaning. But the countenance of the arch villain was calm and undis- turbed, and he said: "I should be sorry to believe, master Rodewell, that a conspiracy exists; but if you have suspicions, I shall feel it my duty to incorporate them in my despatches, referring to you as the authority; and I will of course expect you to bring to light some tangible evidence to satisfy the Govern- ment and enable it to crush the traitors," "I will not shrink from any responsibility which Sir Henry shall be pleased to place upon me, although I fear the consequences to me would be severe, if it proved that   168       WILLITOFT, OR THE the conspiracy did not exist," said Rodewell with apparent caution. "It is too late, master Rodewell, to escape this duty, disagreeable as it may be to you," said Sir Henry quickly. "I shall note these facts which you have given me, and refer to you concerning them." l} Rodewell bowed, but did not answer; and Sir Henry began to enlarge his report. As soon as this was finished, Rodewell arose to depart, saying: "Sir Henry, it will be my next business, then, to keep a close watch upon Willitoft and, if any thing suspi- cious occurs, to cause a search to be made. I have still some of Justice Lockson's warrants in blank, and I pre- sume it would be better that I should use them than yours." "Certainly, master Rodewell, I commend your consid- eration. Cunning rogue," he added, as the pursuivant left the room--" well, it is with such tools that we must work in this world." If -that "tool" had heard the remark of the excellent justice, he would have answered mentally-only mentally as yet--"Take care, Sir Henry, there are some tools which are edge-tools, some even .which are double edge tools- and cut both ways." Master Rodewell was soon gallopping away from House- well upon the track of the party which had the prisoners in. charge. When he overtook them, he drew up beside Foxly and whispered a few words in his ear, and then rode up to the wagon in which the prisoners were conveyed, and ad- dressed himself to the elder Hurlstone. "Ned, this is a sad business, indeed: the baronet swears vengeance upon you. Take my word for it that your bet- ter course is to give information: if you have any friend to conceal, why conceal him in heaven's name.--I am not the   DAYS OF JAMES I.       169 man to ruin an old acquaintance; only give me some gen- eral facts under your hand and I think I can get you off: otherwise, thumb-screws, iron boots, &c. will be your lot. By the way, the baronet has sent off to have the children taken into custody and bound out to some cruel old puri- tan or other. Come, Ned, don't stand in your own light and ruin your friends too!" "Away, tempter! I will not sell my soul again!" said Edward Hurlstone, and then remained in immovable silence. "Well, take your own course," said Rodewell, after sev- eral unsuccessful attempts to draw him into conversation. "I shall leave you to your fate." After a few moment's conference with Foxly, Rodewell turned his horse's head towards the little village of Under- wood. It was after noon when he reached the hostel of Giles Horstead, long after the dinner hour of that day, and ordering a few dishes and a flagon of ale, he retired to his room. "Ha another point gained," he mused. "No sooner do I prepare the groundwork of my conspiracy, than this cunning employer of mine puts himself in my power, and runs in-and offers me his aid to reveal it all to Government and give me the credit of the discovery. Ah, your very cunning man sometimes over-reaches himself. Now, I shall approach the officials at London with a good recommenda- tion and my proofs will be attended to. For the rest, Sir Henry shall further my plans himself. Conspiracy and trea- son! Poor Travers conspire and turn traitor! Pah! Sir Henry understands it all! he takes part in my plot: he knows that I see through him; and now he is in my power. He shall serve me, Or I will ruin him." And then this bad man sat down to meditate further up- on his evil plans. 15 /*   CHAPTER X. I've chosen my bride,  I will seek her through strife.; Whate'er may betide, I'll be faithful through life. Death cannot sever The bonds of our love; Joy will for ever Be ours above."-ANoN. N the morning of the day on which the Hurlstones had been arrested, George and William Scott ar- rived at Willitoft. Julia Travers was walking on the lawn and received them with a pleasant smile, though something of pique mingled in her greeting of the younger and more favored friend. "Well, gentlemen, I welcome you to Willitoft, after your prolonged absence," said the lively girl, "and you, most particularly, my good Sir, the younger yet the older stranger." "You speak in paradoxes, Julia," replied George Scott, blushing slightly. "It seems, George," said William Scott, cheerfully, "that you understand the paradox well enough, at all events. Let me defend the honor of my gallant brother, fair friend: we have had a gay young visitor with us,--nay pout not, gen- tle lady! you wrong him, he did not forget you. But this gay young visitor is courtly and polished, and so accom- plished that our young squireen would as lief been caught oi one of his own trout hooks, as have brought him hither. Never was lover in old romaunt half so jealous----'   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I.  171 "Now, William, methinks that you and I have changed places and dispositions. Here am I grave and confused, and you gay and cheerful, and as full of fine speeches as a very courtier, the character you assign our young friend, Alton; now he affecteth gay court ladies,-and I have often heard Julia declare she could not abide such taste; and then you know it is not customary at Willitoft to receive strangers." "And then, and then, Sir George, were there no excep- tions, I fear me much, you would have been denied to-day, you are such a stranger," said the young girl playfully. "But, truly, I should have liked much to lay eyes upon this youthful paragon, who, you wise and considerate gentle- men feared, might have carried me away by strategy from Willitoft, for thus I read your caution." "Nay,- now, Julia, you must spare poor George. He hath been scheming all the way hither, how he should con. fess himself and obtain his pardon." "Aunt," exclaimed the young lady, as she led ,the bro- thers into the room, where her father and relative were sit- ting, "Aunt, Papa, here are two pilgrims come to sue for pardon for their long neglect." "Well, my child, we will punish them by a hearty wel. come," said Mr. Travers, shaking them cordially by the hand. "What say you, sister?" "That I will scold George, lay a penance on William.- and-forgive and welcome both--." said the excellent old lady laughing, "Pray, aunt, what may my penance be? I will dree my dree." "Come, child, and sit down by me, an old woman, and amuse me."    172       WILLITOFT, OR THB "Right heartily, good aunt," said the young man, taking his seat on a footstool near her, " and how shall I amuse you?" "By laughing and chatting as if you were a different William Scott, from a certain silent, thoughtful William Scott, whom I knew a few weeks ago." "A heavy heart makes a dull companion, Aunt Nelly; but mine I think is lighter now, and I may be able to fulfil your injunctions." "True enough, Aunt Nelly," said George Scott, "if you have forgotten the scolding which you owed and promised me-what is the matter with William? For the last two days he has been as merry as a cricket; he has been here, lately, several times, and really I believe he has found a lady love somewhere." "Doubtless I have, and a right faithful one, too, brother George; moreover, I think I am accepted." "And why should he not, George," said Julia, laughing at George's surprise. "Surely he is good enough, and- poh, I won't feed his vanity by saying, handsome too." "Seriously, here is a mystification," said George Scott, looking anxiously towards Julia; "who can be this lady love that William has found who has accepted him so rea- dily? . Have you a visitor here that I knew not of?" "She has long been a dweller here," said Aunt Nelly mischievously.  "And she will accept you as readily, brother George," replied William Scott, seriously. "But then you must for- sake all other love, and every rival. Nevertheless, I hope to have the pleasure of presenting her to you some day or other as my spouse.' "Truly, now, this is a mystification - I have lost the thread of it," said Mr. Travers.   DAYS OF JAMES r.       173 "And I, too," said Aunt Nelly. "And I," said Julia. "And I ---  never had it," said George. "Well, well: time will unravel all, and to time you must leave it," said the elder brother seriously. "A patient bride, yours, William!" said Aunt Nelly. "Yes-she never wearies in her constancy," replied the young man. "Now, aunt, have I amused you? If I have, I would relish much hearing that scolding of George's." "Indeed, child, you agitate me, instead of amusing me," said the good old lady, looking kindly and sadly upon him. "I think I read your riddle," she added with a sigh. "Nay, you will read it soon enough," said William Scott. "I depart to-morrow for London, 'on my way to meet her." "So soon!" said the old lady sadly. "Ah we will miss you much-mayhap it will be long before we see you again." "Going to London 1" exclaimed Julia, "how delightful! I should love to see London! Oh! William, you shall give me a full description of the city, when you return." "Idle curiosity, child," said the aunt. "It is better to see and hear as little as possible of London in these days." "But aunt, what means William about a bride? I un- derstood, I thought, at first; but now I am mystified," said Julia Travers. "A secret, Aunt Nelly," said William Scott smiling. "If you have found my secret, you have no right to give it to another-it is mine still!" "As you please, William; it is better too," said the old lady sadly. The cheerfulness of the company was somewhat lessened by the course the conversation had taken, as much, indeed, by the apparent mystery of William\Scott's movements, as by the fear of some impending danger which Aunt Nelly's 15*   174       WILLITOFT, OR THE words had indicated. However, William Scott, cheerful himself, endeavored to enliven the conversation: his efforts were useless, and he at length arose and proceeded to the library in search of Father Tichbourne. He found the ven- erable old man in the little oratory, and he knelt beside him, before the altar, in silent prayer and meditation. "George! do you understand William's movements?" said Julia to her friend, as they strolled out upon the lawn, after the departure of the elder brother. "Indeed, Julia, it is all incomprehensible to me. But could we add our stores of knowledge together, doubtless we might make out a full- understanding." "But, George, William does not wish us to find out his secret, or he would tell us, and it is not right to pry into it." "Well, I shall not pry into it: only, I am sorry that he is going. I am sure it will be long, very long, before we see him again, judging from the preparations he is making for his departure. Mother is aware of all his plans, whatever they may be. Yesterday he spent several hours with her, and when they separated, her eyes were red with weeping, whilst he was calm and resolute, indeed rather cheerful. I cannot understand it. Never have I seen so marked a change in any man." For some moments they walked on in silence; at length, George Siott exclaimed: "See, Julia, those weeping children, coming up the ave- nue -accompanied by the porter! What means this?" and he pointed to the group. A little girl, about seven years of age, carried in her arms an infant, while a boy several years younger than herself, followed close behind her, clinging to her dress. The boy and girl, were weeping bitterly, while the unconscious babe -      ,  "I   DAYS OF JAMES 1.       175 playfully wound her little hands in the flowing hair of her sister. "Let us see, George, what is the matter!" exclaimed Julia, hastening towards them. "Ah, they are Mary Hurl- stone's children! Gracious heaven! what can have hap- pened? What is the matter, Mary?" said she, addressing the eldest. At first the poor child only replied by a new burst of tears; then, at last, she spoke in a voice broken by her sobs. "Father-mother--! They have taken them away! Ah, Miss Julia, what shall we do?" "Who have taken them away?" said George Scott quickly. "They, the officers.--We were out playing in the hills with baby, and when we came back, father and mother and uncle were gone. We thought they would come back, and we waited and waited,-but no one came, and we were all alone, and nobody to help us. Then one of the neighbors came and found us, and'told us, that the consta- bles had taken father and mother and uncle to jail, and we should never see them again!"And the little girl burst out into a wild cry, utterly inconsolable, as the terrible thing forced itself fully upon her young mind again. "Poor Mary!" lisped the baby winding its little arms around her neck, and laying its cheek upon its sister's. "Don't ty, don't ty." Alas, fatherless and motherless little one! "Oh! mother-father," sobbed the little boy. "Ah! This is dreadful!" said Julia Travers, the tears streaming down her cheeks, "dreadfull!" "Perhaps, Julia," said George Scott, " it is but a momen- tary arrest from which money can obtain their discharge." "Oh, no! it is worse than that!-those cruel laws! They would not arrest a womnan for less than that; their crime is   176       WILLITOFT, OR THE that they are Catholics. Oh, I see it now!" she continued, as the details of Father Tichbourne's visit to the Hurlstones forced themselves upon her recollection. "Alas, poor chil- dren, it is true, you will never see them again, I fear!" "Tell me, Julia, tell me all, perhaps I can assist these poor people. You know that your wishes are laws to me." "Their uncle was reconciled to the Catholic Church in their house-they are all arrested. You see it is discovered and you know their fate."  "Accursed be these men and these cruel laws," exclaim- ed George Scott sternly. "Let us lead these little children to the house," said Miss Travers. "But, Julia, you will compromise yourselves by receiv- ing them here." "What matter, what matter! Oh, George, could you be so cruel as to drive from your door these poor motherless, fatherless, unprotected children? No! no, George; I will protect and shelter them," she replied passionately. "Nay, Julia, you must not! They shall find a refuge in xmy mother's house. -Us, they cannot compromise; your they may. Poor innocent children!" They turned towards the house. At the same moment two men appeared walking rapidly up the avenue towards the group. The porter who was returning towards the lodge endeavored in vain to stop. them.-They pressed by him; but his clamors soon drew a crowd of the servants to the spot and the two men were seized and about to be forcibly ejected from the premises. "In the name of the king," shouted one of these two men, "I command you to stand off! Villains we are act- ing under a warrant from one of his majesty's justices of the peace. Do you dare to resist the law?"   DAYS OF JAMES I.       1" "Out with him!" exclaimed the porter indignantly, "it is false, he has no warrant; he is no officer, but a spy!- to the horse pond with him!" George Scott hastened to the spot, fearful that the indis- creet zeal of the servants might injure the master of Willi- toft. In a oment the disturbance ceased. "What means this?" he said. "Ah, Sir, you have done wrong," said the porter in a low tone, "you should have permitted us to cast'them out. It is too late now," he added, as the officer drew out his warrant, and pulling off his hat displayed the features of John Foxly. "Ah, villains," exclaimed Foxly, "you shall suffer for this! And you, Sir, you have stood in my way once, but you,shall not do it again; I will do my duty in spite of threats and violence!" "I have no desire to prevent you from doing your duty," said Scott, with difficulty restraining his anger, "but pro- ceed lawfully; I have a right to demand your object in thus clandestinely obtaining an entrance into the premises of my relative, Mr. Travers." "I have a warrant for those children there, whom that young lady is taking into the house. They are the children of that obdurate papist, Hurlstone, and are to be bound out to some good Protestant, to be brought up in the way of right- eousness," said Foxly, imitating the puritanic cant, which began to be in vogue among many of the ultra gospellers. A murmur of indignation ran through the crowd, but any other exhibition of anger was prevented by the pre- sence of George Scott. "' I must pass on; follow me, Jedediah, and if any attempt is made to detain us, we must use the arms of the flesh," said John Foxly, drawing a long pistol and pressing om,   178       WILLITOFT, OR THE The children had now reached the door, and Julia, alarm- ed for the safety of her friend paused there. Mr. Travers was approaching the group, which moved up around the officers presenting a threatening circle ready to spring upon them at the slightest intimation from their master or young Scott. William Scott attracted by the noise and confusion, reached the side of Mr. Travers at the same time that the two offi- cers came abreast of him. Here there was a moment's pause, and the officers stated their purpose to Mr. Travers; the old gentleman became indignant. "What!" he exclaimed, "do you war against women and children? Would you tear away from the house of their landlord, their only place of refuge, the children of the tenants whom you have imprisoned?" The wrath of the servants was deeply excited, when the pursuivant boldly pressed forward, saying: "It is well known, Sir, that you are a papist, and therefore a protector and harborer of papists. But help-here! I call on all loyal subjects of the king to aid me in the execution of this warrant, which is resisted by this traitorous papist and his adherents, Masters George and William Scott, you are good Protestants. I summon you to aid in the enforcement of my duty and the king's authority!" George6 Scott became pale and livid with anger as he- strode towards the officer. "Villain, dare you put this in- dignity upon gentlemen?" he exclaimed, raising his arm to strike the fellow to the earth* "Hold, hold, George," said Mr. Travers quickly, {" hold! you will place yourself in this man's power. It is better to submit to the laws, how unjust soever they may be." ' "Submit to such an insult! never!" exclaimed the ex. cited'young man. In a moment, his brother was at his side, and, drawing him away, said calmly: J i   DAYS OF JAMES I.       179 "Brother, do not violate the laws, nor forget the duty of a Christian and a gentleman. If the law command by its agents, that in which as a Christian you may not obey it, yield to its penalties! You can do no more!" The pursuivant, who seemed determined to irritate the party as much as possible, pressed on towards the young children. George Scott cast one single glance towards them: he saw only-Julia Travers, pale but resolute, stand- ing between them and the advancing officers, and, shaking off the hand of his brother, he sprang forward and placed himself ,in their front. "Back, ruffian," he said hoarsely, " dare not to outrage the unprotected!" "Oh, George, they are saved. It is your father!" ex- claimed Julia Travers, and at the same moment, a horse- man dashed rapidly up the avenue towards the group and leaped to the ground. "In the name of heaven, what is this?" asked Mr. Scott, hastening to the spot where his son stood confronting the armedf officer. "This wretch!" said the young man indignantly, "seeks to tear away these poor children who have sought protec- tion here. Their parents have been imprisoned for some imaginary crime. I have interfered to prevent it, and. he has had the impudence to call on me to aid him." "I have a warrant, your honor, to arrest them. Their father and mother were committed this morning to the county jail for assisting in the reconcilement of a papist.. They are to be bound out to a good Protestant," said the officer boldly. The children had ceased to weep in the terror which seized upon them throughout this strange scene, but continued to cling to Julia Travers with instinc- tive hope.   180       WILLITOFT, OR THE "I had already determined to take the children under my protection," said George Scott, "before this fellow came, and had received the consent of Miss Travers, who is in a measure the protectress and friend of their mother, in addition to having a claim upon them as the daughter of their landlord to whom they had fled for protection." "Has this warrant been executed?" said Mr. Scott to the officer. "It has not, Sir. It has been resisted, and I call on you as a magistrate to enable me to execute it," said the bailiff boldly, handing it to him. "I will see that the authority of his majesty's justices is obeyed, and their warrants respected," replied Mr. Scott, drawing a case with pen and ink from his pocket, and writing upon the warrant. "You will not give them up, father!" said George Scott. "Silence, Sir! I will do my duty!" said/the old man, sternly. "You see, master constable, these are the chil- dren named in your writ, take them into your custody." The officer approached towards the children, who shrunk from him clinging to the dress of Julia Travers sobbing and crying. George Scott turned away, unable to look upon the silent and hopeless sorrow of his fair friend. The rest of the spectators gazed gloomily on, while with a glance of triumph John Foxly took possession of the little ones. "Have you arrested them, constable?" said Mr. Scott, still holding the warrant in his hand. "Yes, Sir," replied Foxly. "Well, your warrant was not made returnable to any particular magistrate, and I have made it returnable to my- self-both because you have desired me to see to its exe- cution, and because being on the spot I have a right to take   DAYS OF JAMES I.       181 cognizance of the matter. 'You will return the warrant before me, therefore, and at once." "Thank heaven for that," shouted George Scott; and the bailiff turned pale and red by turns as he saw that he was baffled. But, in a moment, his countenance cleared up and he muttered, "Perhaps it is better still," and taking the warrant, wrote his return upon it aind handed it again to Mr. Scott. In the meanwhile, all the group had gathered closely round and breathlessly awaited the result. "Here are three children to be bound out. Master George Scott, you have said you would take care of them, will you be bound for their Protestant education, their food and raiment?" "I will right heartily," said George Scott, with an exult- ing glance at Julia Travers, " and William here will join in my bond." "In no such bond will I enter," said William Scott firmly. The pursuivant smiled, and the elated circle seemed sad- dened and downcast. "It matters not;" said Mr. Scott calmly, "George Scott hath an ample estate in his own right, his undertaking is sufficient. Master constable, deliver the children to their master!" How the joyous shout of the group of servants rang out under the eaves of that old house, as the baffled pursuivant gave up the children to young Scott, and turned away with his companion down the avenue. "Many blessings on thy head, good Master Scott!" shouted they one and all, and right from their hearts came up that blessing. The little party now entered the house; and the father gravely reproved George for attempting to interrupt an offi- cer in the discharge of his official duty. 16   182       WILLITOFT, OR THE "It is a perilous thing, George. Fortunately, however, I had determined this eveningto ride over here after you had departed. When I reached the gate, I perceived the confusion upon the lawn, and came up in time to save you from a grave offence. Still, I think it will be necessary for you to spend some time away from us, and, no d6ubt, the whole matter will be overlooked. But you have involved me somewhat: what do you intend to do with your proteges?" "I will take them to my mother, who will protect and provide for them." "Fortunately, Mr. Travers has taken no part in this mat- ter: yet, even so, I fear it may redound to his injury. Come this way, Travers, I wish to speak a word in your ear. I fear," he continued when they were out of hearing of the rest, "I fear there is some deep scheming at work. I learn that the famous pursuivant, master Rodewell, has been for some time lurking about this part of the country and is now at Underwood. The fellow who was here this even- ing, was one of his satellites I believe. Connecting his recent movements-the arrest of the Hurlstones, this at- tempt on their children, and various rumors about the Ca- tholics which have been set afloat lately, with the former search of your house, I am induced to believe that some designing person is seeking to revive those odious persecu- tions for some sinister purpose." "Ah, my friend, how can I avoid their shafts?" replied Mr. Travers. "You know that under the laws, as they ex- ist, I, like every other Catholic, am at the mercy of any man who may think it worth his while to proceed against me." - "Nay, nay! Mr. Travers, you can avoid the heavier pe- nalties- of of the laws, by keeping out of the more serious breaches of them. For instance, I would advise at least i,   DAYS OF JAMES I.       183 the temporary removal o( your teacher; his presence may give rise to suspicion, and-suspicion will certainly bring trouble upon you." -"I will attend to your suggestion," replied Mr. Travers. "I think there are other measures, which it will be ne- cessary for you to take: but of these we will consult toge- ther, after the departure of the boys. I believe it is better that they should both be away at present. George is rajsh, and his quick temper will lead him into difficulties without benefit to his friends." "Twice has George been of service to us," said Mr. Travers. "The firststime of essential aid: on this occa- sion, indeed, I felt deeply interested in the fate of these poor children whom he has, with your assistance, rescued from their pursuers." "Let us rejoin the rest," resumed Mr. Travers. "It would be useless to alarm the ladies now, as the whole mat- ter may blow over." "And so, Mr. Scott, you are sending both our young friends away;" said Aunt Nelly. "What shall we ladies do without them?" "Ah, it is for fear of the effect of your charms here," replied Mr. Scott, casting a playful look at Julia, "I must get my boys out of danger as soon as possible. To-mor- row they start for London, and I shall follow them in a few days. The trip is rather unexpected to George, I doubt not, and equally so to me." "I can assure you, father, it is not only unexpected to me," said George, 'but unpleasant." "So much the greater reason for your going!" replied his father, smiling. "I fear my remedy is already too late- and the disease incurable." George was silent and his father continued:   184       WILLITOFT, OR THE "Besides, you promised to meet Alton in London. He will be surprised to find you so punctual." "And when may we look for your return, master George?" inquired Mr. Travers. There was a moment's pause; but Mr. Scott replied for his son, "Indeed, Travers, I do not know when George will return. I have long been anxious that he should spend some time in the metropolis. It is very useful for a young man to see something of the world: it gives him a polish. The present occasion is a good one. The length of his stay will depend on himself and the rapidity of his im- provement."  "We, here, think that George might be spoiled but not improved by such a visit,; said Aunt Nelly, smiling. "Ah, you will in truth spoil him," replied Mr. Scott, laughing. George Scott seemed to have much to say as he made his -adieus to Julia Travers: he lingered and hung back- but much as he had to say, he could say nothing but- "Farewell, Julia, I will write you an account of what I find in London which may amuse you.-Shall I?" he add- ed with hesitation. "Yes, George, she replied, frankly giving him her hand. "Yes, and I will read your letters to papa and Aunt Nelly, for they will like to hear of your amusements," she added archly. This was not exactly what George Scott desired, but in his heart he acknowledged the propriety of the condition which she thus annexed to her permission, and was fain to be contented with it. With many injunctions from Aunt Nelly as to how he should conduct himself in London, and many friendly words from Mr. Travers, George Scott at length turned to   DAYS OP JAMES I.       185 depart, saying, "Julia; Aunt Nelly, I will leave my little wards with you until to-morrow, when my mother will send for them." William Scott had parted with a hearty grasp of the hand all round: a tear gathered in the kindly eye of Aunt Nelly, as he sprang gracefully into his saddle, and she said men- tally, "A blessing on you, noble youth. God's blessing on your gallant heart-for a noble and gallant heart it is that will breast the danger of the path you have chosen for your footsteps! Fare ye well!" she added aloud, as the father and his two manly sons rode cheerfully down the avenue-" farewell. God's benison be upon you, till we all meet again." "Alas, when shall that be?" she added sadly, as she turned away. 16*    CHAPTER XI. ' "Is there no hand-in this dark hour To shield them from oppressing power, To break the fetter, burst the chain, And give them life and hope again?"-ANoN. O! ho! ho! John Foxly, but you bring me rare good news. Ha! ha! ha! Why, the Devil himself must be playing our game for us; it is played so well." "Ah! master Rodewell, it was hard to stand: neverthe- less, I submitted to it in the hope that it would be better thus." "Better thus? Oh, infinitely!" replied Rodewell. "Let me think," continued he, mentally, "how stand we? The elder Scott, a convert;-treasonable works found in his room;-the younger Scott, first protecting a papist, then resisting the king's authority;-and then, the father steps in to frustrate the action of one of his majesty's justices of the peace, and binds over these children to his own son:- additional, an affidavit which brings master William within the pains and penalties.' Now for another to bind up the rest! Call in Jedediah," he said aloud, "and we will have an affidavit made of these matters." *    Jedediah, the assistant constable, entered at once. It is not necessary to go into the details of the process by which the skilful affidavit maker managed to secure a deposition sufficiently strong for his purpose. Enough, that Jedediah, with his puritanic zeal against the men of Belial, went far enough and fast enough, without pricking, to make the   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I.   187 pursuivant snap his fingers with delight: so far, indeed, that the other parties to the transaction would no longer have recognized themselves in the bold and open traitors which the affidavit of the puritan described them. Master John Foxly added his own, and the worthy pair departed at once to make oath to them before worshipful master Holdfast Lockson, one of his majesty's justices of the peace. Hold- fast, held up his hands in horror at the recital of the amaz- ing and diabolical treason, which the papistical party was hatching, and proposed to raise the country to put down this "unlawful and armed assemblage of papists and per- sons popishy inclined," for thus the affidavits ran, " who had resisted with force and arms, the warrant of his majes- ty's justice, and maltreated the officers of the law." But upon the representation of Foxly that it would be more politic to permit the conspirators to proceed further, in or- der that the whole design might be developed and crushed, the good puritan consented to permit the power of the law to slumber yet awhile, declaring that when it did awake, it should awake like the lion in his wrath. When John Foxly had returned and reported the condi- tion of things to his superior, Rodewell took possession of the papers for the purpose of laying them before Sir Henry "And, Foxly, you may secrete the arms, of which I hope you have obtained a sufficient number. The time could not be more propitious." "I have one case of matchlocks, some twenty pocket pistols, and several bundles of pikes." "Oh excellent! You may place the pikes and halberts in Hurlstone's house--the muskets and pistols ---" "I have ascertained the place for them!" interrupted Foxly. "There is a deserted cottage just in the rear of Willitoft; and a beaten path leads from it to that house.   188       WILLITOFT, OR THE Besides, a very disorderly family was turned away from the cottage a few weeks ago, and that will look like a prepara- tion for this purpose." "Good, master John Foxly, you are improving. But what of this family? Can we not make something more out of them? Doubtless they will be willing witnesses against old Travers." "I will try that," replied Foxly. "Well, you to the hills, and I to Sir Henry! But stay! The arms must not be discovered by us. Let me think. Ah! when you have safely hidden them, return hither; in yonder clump of trees you will find near a large stone a bundle of beggar's clothes. Disguise yourself, and go to Jedediah and put him on the scent-you can invent a story for the purpose. Go!"And the worthy couple separated, the one to carry out his designs in the hills, the other to bear further tidings to Sir Henry Marsden. Once Rodewell paused, as he met a man coming into the road from a- by- way and, for a while, conversed eagerly with him, then hurried onward. Sir Henry was very indignant when he heard the story of the affair at Willitoft, and, doubtless, the version of it given by the pursuivant was not calculated to lessen the ire of the schemer. "Ha! these Scotts! I have marked them! I would not wondcer if they were more than half papist." "You are right, Sir Henry. Your penetrating eye is not to be blinded," said the pursuivant. "I have just received information on my way hither, from that servant of whom I spoke to you, which induces me to believe that they are secretly papists. It should be looked to." "Ah this fellow of yours, this spy-I should like to see J -   DAYS OF JAMES I.    ,   189 nim. I think I might gain such information from him as would place the Scotts in my power." ' Why, Sir Henry, said Rodewell quickly, "I will bring the fellow to-morrow-now if he accept my offer," he thought, "I have mistaken my man." "It matters not," replied Sir Henry, " it might excite the suspicion of the Scotts-while you can always see him at Underwood with'out attracting remark." "As you please, Sir Henry. The man is not very shrewd and I doubt not that I can fathom him. This morning, he informed me that the two young Scotts departed very unex- pectedly for London, that the father is preparing to follow them in a few days; that, from the preparations and adieus, one at least of the young men will be absent for a long while, and is going abroad. He further said, that as soon as the sons had departed the father visited Willitoft, re- mained there some hours, and when he returned he had those children of the Hurlstones with him. Now, if they be good Protestants there would be no necessity for such serious measures to avoid the consequences of this affair; but being papists or popishy inclined, they might well fear that their acts would bring down upon them the power of the law, were their perversion discovered. This is the con- clusion I have come to. Inl the meanwhile, I have directed my man to continue his observations and inform me of every thing that passes." "It is well; but would it not be advisable to have young Scott arrested on the charge of preventing the service of a writ?" "I think not. His flight is more advantageous to us. It twill, in connection with other things, destroy the influence bf the family; and, the protection of the Scotts withdrawn   190       WILLITOFT, OR THE from Willitoft, the greatest difficulty will be removed from our path." "Now, then, we may proceed with rapidity you think?" "Certainly." But we shall not carry our readers through the details of the conversation that ensued, nor unfold the minutia of the plot. After an hour's stay, Rodewell returned to the little hostel, with his purse filled with broad gold pieces, the ear- nest of his future reward. As he sat at his window ab- stractedly, a beggar approached and asked alms. "Ha, you rogue," he said laughingly, after a pause; "I did not recognise you at first-go!" and master Foxly limped off to do his duty. In a few minutes more, he saw him in close conversation with Jedediah and perceived that he was pushing the constable hard for a bargain. Jedediah offered a few pennies, which the pretended beggar indig- nantly refused, then a sixpence, then a shilling, but in vain; the beggar resolutely held out, and the constable, at last, desperately plunged his hand into his purse and drew out a half crown and put it into his hand. The beggar instantly took off his hat, bowed low, and led off Jedediah to make the discovery which he had promised him. Rodewell laughed heartily at the success of the scheme and quietly awaited the result. Towards night Foxly returned to the hostelry in his own proper person, and shortly after a messenger arrived from the constable to inform Rodewell that he had made an im- portant discovery, and that he would come in the morning to detail the particulars.  "Foxly, how stands it?" said Rodewell, when that hon- est official made his appearance in his room. "Well, master Rodewell, the arms at Hurlstone's house have been discovered, and a certain beggar has given indi-   DAYS OF JAMES 1.       191 cations by means of which certain other arms may be found in concealed places. This beggar, it seems, as he lay hid under a hedge at night, heard a body of men, carrying boxes, pass by him and followed them until they deposited their burdens. Then he, of course, went to master Jede- diah the constable of the hundred, and, for a valuable con- sideration, to wit, the full sum of a half crown, bestowed his important discovery upon him," and master Foxly, with a hearty laugh, produced the coin from his pocket. "Why did you not demand a larger reward?" said Rode- well merrily. "Poor Jedediah! I thought you were fleec- ing him." "Trust me for that, master Rodewell, Jedediah is too keen! If I play beggar, I must take beggar's pay." "And where are the arms?" "They are there still. I suggested to Jedediah to mark them, and promised, for another half crown, to watch them, by which means he might discover the designs of the con- spirators." "Good! very good! master Foxly, and Jedediah - " "Thought so, too," said Foxly. "I have a notion to get more of that whining puritanical rascal's half crowns. He is cunning withal, and looks out for the main chance." "Doubt it not, John Foxly." On the following morning, Jedediah came to communi- cate the astounding intelligence that he had discovered a quantity of halberds and pikes concealed in the house of the Hurlstones, who were notorious papists; which timely information was received, as he expected, with exclama- tions of surprise by Rodewell and Foxly. Never was vil- lage constable more delighted than he with the encomiums upon his skill and vigilance which the pursuivants poured out lavishy upon him. Master Rodewell prepared a full   192       WILLITOFT, OR THE statement of the matter, saying that he would present it to Sir Henry Marsden with his own hands, and it was impos- sible to say what rewards master Jedediah might not there- after expect for his trusty performance of his duty: he had saved the peace of the kingdom, preserved the lives of good Protestants from popish massacre; and let him now but dis- cover the conspirators and aid in bringing them to justice and his fortune was made for life. Jedediah departed, resolving in his own mind to watch carefully the progress of affairs and thereby secure the pro- mised rewards. According to the previous arrangement, he met the pretended beggar that evening, and in his com- pany set out in quest of further discoveries. Jedediah found to his surprise that a few of the pikes had been re- moved: but his companion assured him that nothing else could have been expected; and added, that, if, as was pro- bable, the Travers' people were concerned in the move- ment, the arms would be found in their neighborhood. A long walk brought the worthy pair to the deserted cottage near Willitoft. Here, more astounding facts were revealed to master Jedediah, who began to dread at' every step the sudden appearance of armed and bloody papists ready to slaughter every good and loyal Protestant in the realm, himself in particular: matchlocks and pistols, dirks and bludgeons, and some small parcels of ammunition were most carelessly concealed abbut the hut, these arms were marked by Jedediah; and the beggar undertook to remain in the neighborhood to watch for their removal. Jedediah returned to the village big with the secret he had acquired and certain of his reward. It was now dark and silent about Willitoft. Its peaceful inhabitants, after invoking the protection of the immaculate Mother of the afflicted upon their persecuted house, had confided them-   DAYS OF JAMES I.       193 selves to repose, little dreaming of the new plots which were thickening around them. Foxly, without fear of in- terruption, concealed the arms in the out-houses about the dwelling, and near the cottages of those tenants whom he had ascertained to be particularly faithful to the family. In compliance with the directions of his superior, he did not fail to secrete some of the weapons in the dwellings of such of Mr. Scott's tenants as were likely to become ob- jects of suspicion. To complete these arrangements, of course, occupied him several nights. At length he an- nounced that all was ready: the constable was informed that the arms had been removed by the conspirators and instructed where they were to be found, and directed to make his affidavit before the ever convenient Justice Hold- fast Lockson, to whom nonconformity and popish plots were as meat, drink, and raiment. Armed with the neces- sary warrants and supported by a strong constabulary force of patriotic Protestant lieges who immediately beat to arms to repel the dangerous schemes of these "bloody papists," who were about to dethrone the king and slaughter his lov- ing subjects, John Foxly set out to the scene of his recent labors. His orders were to arrest every man, woman and child in those houses where concealed weapons might be found, in order that this dreadful conspiracy might be probed to the bottom. There was nothing now to fear from the interference of the Scotts: the two sons had been absent nearly ten days; and their father had followed them soon after with the intention of remaining in London several weeks:-so the pursuivant had learned from the unfortu- nate groom, over whose head he still held the threat of death and torture. At all events, Rodewell felt that he would soon be able to destroy the influence of the Scotts, and hoped to compromise them seriously in the coming 17   194       WILLITOFT, OR THE revelations. Therefore, with perfect confidence of success the party marched forward towards Willitoft. The officers first proceeded to search the houses of several peasants, and having found the arms, arrested the people and carried them in their traifn. Having secured eight or ten of these unhappy creatures who continually protested their ignor- ance of the weapons, they presented themselves before the park gate of Willitoft. The porter resisted their entrance, and as they were prepared for such an event, the gates were soon broken down, an entrance effected and the par- ty hastened to the house. Mr. Travers met them on the lawn. "What means this violence now?" he said calmly. "Why come you hither agaia to disturb peaceful. and quiet people in this mode?" "Traitors, you mean," said Rodewell, "traitors. Mr. Travers, your treason has been discovered at last! Sorry am I to say it. Arms of all kinds have been discovered in the houses of your tenantry and information has been given under oath to one of his majesty's justices, that there were evident preparations for a rising and a massacre of all the king's faithful and honest lieges." "Treason! Good heaven! Treason! I commit treason!" exclaimed Mr. Travers, surprised and indignant at the charge. "It avails not, sir," said the pursuivant, sternly. "We must search." And, at a signal from their leader, two of the men sprang suddenly upon Mr. Travers and bound him securely. He submitted patiently and without a struggle. Julia Travers, who had witnessed this scene from the house, rushed out pale and weeping, and cast herself upon her father's breast. With cold indifference, the pursuivant or- dered her to be removed and placed among the females in custody who had been left at the lodge. Her aunt was 71   DAYS OF JAMES I.       195 found upon her knees in tears,-she too was despatched to the lodge. In the meanwhile, the servants had gathered in front of the house, and as soon as they saw their beloved master in the hands of the officers, and his daughter borne away weeping in the rude grasp of the village constables, excited to fury, they threw themselves upon Rodewell and his fol- lowers to rescue them. But the pursuivant had guarded his men against this result--the servants were overpowered and bound; guards were placed around the house; and then Rodewell addressing Mr. Travers, said: "Now, Sir, I will take the liberty of searching your house and premises." "I am your prisoner," said Mr. Travers with dignity, "and must submit to you." Rodewell now felt secure of his prey: he had not only involved Mr.,Travers in the meshes of a conspiracy, but by securing his arrest and the removal of the family and plac- ing the house in the charge of his own people, he could not fail to capture the person of the priest whom he believed to be concealed there. He at once ordered a search. "Well, thank God," said Mr. Travers mentally, "I have followed Scott's advice. Poor Father Tichbourne is safe and. away, nothing can be proven-against us, and we may yet escape." The only results of the examination was the discovery of a few prayer-books and rosaries,-but in the out-houses several pikes, halberds, pistols and matchlocks were found. "Ah, Sir, this is dreadful!" said the pursuivap Mr. Travers, "here is the exact quantity to arm all the men in your employ." "How they came here, I know not," said Mr. Travers, in great surprise."   196       WILLITOFT, OR THE "It is useless, Sir. I have heard the same reply at each house I have visited, and at each house I have found the same kind of arms hidden away as carefully. I fear there can be no longer any doubt of a secret and most foul con- spiracy. It is my duty to carry you before the magistrates who have received the information and who are now in session at Mr. Lockson's house." "Ah!" said Mr. Travers sadly, " you will permit the la- dies to retain undisturbed possession of the house, now that the search is ended: I feel satisfied that my innocence will appear at once, and that I shall soon return to them." "I regret, Sir," replied Rodewell gravely, with that air of sympathy which he knew well how to assume, even when doing the most cruel acts, "I regret that my orders are strict and require me to convey before the justices every inmate of the houses where concealed arms are found: as it is their expressed determination, to discover from some one or other the details of this horrible conspiracy." "God help us, then," replied Mr. Travers. "I know too well what terrible significance lies in that word discover. But you will, at least permit me to converse with my daugh- ter, before we are dragged away." "It is impossible, Sir, it would defeat the ends of jus- tice," said Rodewell. "Arrange the prisoners, he conti- nued, addressing his men, " and march on!' "You will certainly permit the ladies to be taken to the place of meeting in my carriage," said Mr. Travers. "I have no orders to make any distinction between my prisoners!" replied Rodewell roughly. "Forward there!" The sad procession filed down the avenue in two separate bodies-the men in front surrounded by a strong guard, the women and children in the rear with several officers to pre- vent their escape. At the head of his tenants and servitors,   DAYS. OP JAMES I.       197 conspicuous for his gentle mien, his high, calm aspect, and his patient endurance, walked Mr. Travers: for a moment, hie caught a glimpse of his daughter and -her aunt among the group of females who seemed to sorrow more for the misfortunes of their landlord and protector than for their own,-then the guards pressed them forward again and he lost sight of them. Painfully and slowly toiled along those delicate women, subject to the harshness of rude officials- an hour passed-another! Ah how sadly looked the little village of Underwood to the eyes ofi the wearied captives; and how wildly peered out from their windows the aston- ished and alarmed inhabitants, who thought it strange and terrible that such a group of innocent looking people should/ -- v have conspired the dethronement of the king and the mas. sacre of their neighbors. "There is no judging from appearances," whispered Gaf- fer Thomas. "No; especially with these bloody, Jesuitical papists," replied Goody Jones, tremulously placing her hand upon her neck to feel that it was still sound and whole. And so onward wound the long line through Underwood, until it reached the dwelling of Justice Lockson, before which were already collected a number of carts and wagons. "These, I suppose," said the pursuivant to one of the drivers, " are to transport the prisoners to the county jail." "Yes, your honor, for the bloody papists," replied the man. "Our fate is determined  on, it seems, before we are heard," thought Mr. Travers. "Well, for me, I am past my prime: I have lived long enough-but my. poor daughter; so young, so innocent! Oh, let us put our trust in God!" In a few moments, the party were ushered into the hall. At one end sat Sir Henry Marsden, Justice Lockson, and 17*;   198       WILLITOFT, OR THE another magistrate who boasted the euphonious name of Wellbeloved Hawthorn. Sir Henry sat with his head bow- ed upon his hand, and, as Mr. Travers approached, he turn- ed away, as if to dry his eyes. "Miserable hypocrite!" muttered Rodewell as he watch- ed his movements. "Well, Sir," said Lockson, rudely, to Mr. Travers, "I expected that your devilish papistry would bring you to this at last. Do you see, Sir, you are charged with Treason, with an attempt to excite an armed insurrection to murder all good Protestants. The Lord have mercy on us! And but for the foresight and godly care of brother-hem!- master Jedediah, this diabolical plan might have succeeded. It is our duty now to examine you and the testimony, pre- vious to a commitmenrt if that prove necessary." It would seem, from the preparations without, that you have already decided the charge against us," said Mr. Tra- vers calmly. "Silence, Sir," said the puritan fiercely. "Answer the interrogatories as they are put to you. Are you acquainted with John Hurlstone and his brother?" "a I do most solemnly protest here against this unjust ac- cusation, and I call all Englishmen here to witness --" "Silence, or I will commit you without further hearing." "Proceed, Sir. I will answer.--I will not give- you even the eicuse of my silence for such rank injustice." The face of the puritan became pale with rage; when Sir Henry Marsden spoke, as if deeply affected; "My old and revered friend-Mr. Travers! Alas! that I should meet you thus! Let me implore you to throw no impediments in the course of justice.-It can only injure yourself. If you are innocent, the good law of the land will protect and save you."   DAYS OF JAMES I.       199 "Ah, Sir Henry, the prisoner standing calmly, nobly, before thee, would not change places with thee could he see thy heart," thought Rodewell-but the cold and cruel schemer softened not, though he admired his victim. "I know John Hurlstone and his brother," said Mr. Tra- vers. "They were born on my estates." "Have you seen them lately?" "I have not." "Take care, Sir! These people have been put to the question,* and the truth has been wrung out of one of the three!" "Three! Good God! You did not torture the woman!" exclaimed Mr. Travers, shuddering with an undefined feel- ing of dread. "A woman, aye! she will speak the sooner," said the magistrate harshy. "God help my poor, poor daughter!" murmured the agonized father. "I feel it my duty to inform you for the sake of our old friendship, Mr. Travers," said Sir Henry Marsden, "that this guilty woman has confessed the whole conspiracy, af- ter the third torture, upon the promise of pardon to herself and husband, and they have accordingly been released to- gether with the brother." "Poor deluded creature! she has yielded up her soul for the sake of her body--may God pardon her." "Put that down," said Lockson to the clerk, "as an ad- mission of the truth." In vain Mr. Travers protested. It was so written. "Did you- not send an agent to the Hurlstones to induce them to join in your conspiracy?" "I know of no conspiracy." * The torture.   200       WILLITOFT, OR THE "It will not avail you to prevaricate. Let us come to the point. Can you account for your having large quantities of arms secreted on your premises and distributed among your tenants." "I am innocent of the matter. I know not how they came there." One by one, the justice examined the men' one or two of the most ignorant or timid, under the searching exami- nation, were made to prevaricate, and entrapped into an- swers which seemed to presume the guilt of the whole. At length, the females were brought in. Pale, way-worn, and covered with the dust of the road, her eyes swollen and red with weeping, Julia Travers sprang to the side of her father to throw herself into his arms. At ' a sign from Lockson, an officer seized her rudely and led her before the magistrate. "Oh God! give me strength to bear this," exclaimed the agonized father, at this new indignity. "Girl, pitying your youth and inexperience, this court desires to save you. You have only to tell the truth plainly and clearly and you will be safe." "I will, I will," said Julia eagerly. "Do you know any thing of nightly meetings of the tenants at Willitoft?" "Never have I seen more than one or two there at a time, and they have come to solicit assistance and advice." "Ha! then the tenants came by turns in twos and threes?" "No,--I mean --"  "Answer the interrogatories! Were not the servants accustomed to the u'se of the matchlock?" "I do not know." "How came those weapons upon the premises?" "I know not, as heaven is my judge."   DAYS OF JAMES I.       201 "What has become of the priest and popish agent who was concealed at Willitoft?" Julia Travers faltered. The flush, which the excitement of the moment had called to her cheek, fled and left it of a death-like paleness. She pressed her hands to her fore- head, and looked wildly around-her limbs were about to fail. Her father attempted to reach her side to support her, but the guard restrained him. "Speak, girl! it is your only hope of safety! Speak!" But she was silent. "Will you snot answer? Ha, foolish girl! do you know what the thumb-screw is? Do you know that it will crush your thumbs until the bones are ground to powder? Will you speak?" continued the puritan in a voice of thunder. "Will you not heed the boot that will make those delicate ancles crash up and the marrow ooze out? Will you not heed the rack that shall tear your limbs from their sockets?" With a wild, terror-stricken shriek, the poor girl sprang towards her father and fell at his feet, speechless and almost lifeless. Overcome with horror, men stood aghast-their blood chilled, and their frightened lips efusing to utter the words of execration that rose up from their hearts. "Are ye men or devils?" exclaimed the father struggling to reach his daughter. "Unhand me villain, and let me save my daughter!" The pursuivant sprang forward, calm and indifferent as ever, and raised the feeble girl; while the justice began, as soon as her eyes opened with a wild and frantic look,--- hoping to tear something from her bewildered brain. "What has become of that priest, gir), speak!" An execration of horror arose from the crowd-but it ceased in an instant, for, suddenly, the sound of a horse dashing rapidly up to the door, came through the hall.   202       WILLITOFT, OR THE "Will you speak, or must I send you to the rack?" Julia Travers clasped her hands with an appealing look to heaven, and groaned forth: "Oh, holy Virgin! succor thy child.", At the lower end of the hall, there was a struggle, but above it rose the stern tones of a fine manly voice: "Back, back villains, or I will cleave you to the teeth," and bursting through the crowd with his hand upon the hilt of his sword, George Scott bounded to the side of Julia Travers. "Oh! save me, save me, George!" she exclaimed and fell lifeless upon his bosom. "Accursed be he, who has done this deed," said Scott looking sternly round. "Seize this intruder!" exclaimed the justice quickly, "Seize him and thrust him out." "At your peril, knaves," said George Scott, drawing his breath slowly between his teeth-and he placed Julia Tra- vers in the hands of her aunt and the other females. "At your peril! And you, masters justices, I bring you a par- don for Mr. Travers, his family and tenants, and a protec- tion under the king's own hand for a year from its date." "A pardon! A protection!" rang through the hall, and the crowd forced their way up to the seats of the magis- trates to gaze upon the bearer of such joyful tidings. "Yes, a pardon, and a protection, and an order directed to each and every of his majesty's justices of the peace; to discharge from custody the said James Travers or any of his family and retainers who may be under arrest." "Long live his gracious majesty!" And the crowd of released prisoners re-echoed the joyful benediction. "Baffled, baffled again," muttered the pursuivant bitterly, A thousand curses on thee, Scott, thou shalt perish!"   DAYS OF JAMES I.       203 "It is, indeed, as thou sayest," replied master Holdfast Lockson, as he examined the. parchments-." and we cheer- fully obey the king. Officers, discharge the prisoners!" Let the veil be drawn over the joyous scene-who could picture it? Without, a group of peasants were gathered around the horse of George Scott, which lay struggling with death. The noble black had fallen where his master had dismount- ed, and was drawing his last breath. At length, came forth Mr. Travers and the ladies,-Julia leaning on the arm of George Scott, while Sir Henry Marsden poured out his hypocritical congratulations upon their happy release, as  he bade them adieu. Poor Julia was still sobbing, utterly unable to recover her composure after the terrible trial she had gone through. "Alas, my poor black, you have died in a noble cause," exclaimed George Scott, as they paused beside the dying steed, which, seemingly conscious of its master's presence endeavored to lift its head towards him. George Scott placed his hand affectionately upon the neck of the noble animal, while Mr. Travers said: "You have not explained to us the mystery of our release." "It is simple enough. The arrangements made by you and my father to purchase a protection from the Secretary were successful, and we were about to send it to you by a courier, when a man, soiled and travel stained, pale and emaciated it seemed from recent sickness, and wounded and bruised-we afterwards learned from the torture which he had heroically suffered-found us out and forced his way into the room. It was Edward Hurlstone. In a few words he told us that he and his brother and sister-in-law, had been arrested as we knew, and imprisoned: that they had been put to the torture to make them implicate you,   204   WILLITOPT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I. that the woman's strength at last yielded, and that the pro- mise of pardon for them all, together with the terrible agony which she endured, had at length induced her to confess whatever her torturers put into her mouth: that you were charged with conspiring and preparing for a rising in arms, and other incredible things. My father instantly returned to the Secretary, a general pardon was with great difficulty obtained by the aid of an influential friend at Court-for we knew that innocence alone would be no security. I mounted my horse, and, I thank God, I arrived in time to put a stop to a horrible injustice." There was joy that day in Willitoft. "Curses on you! You have baffled me, George Scott; but I will crush you yet!" exclaimed Sir Henry Marsden, as he strode across his library, shaking his clenched hands to heaven, and stamping furiously on the floor.

Gloom is upon thy lonely hearth, O silent house! once filled with mirth, Sorrow is in the breezy sound , Of thy tall poplars whispering round. What now is left me but to raise From thee, lorn spot! my spirit's gaze, To lift, through tears, my straining eye, Up to my Father's house on high?-HEMANS. -OOUR years have passed. Winter is on the earth. l^^J^1   Around the little hostelry of Underwood whis-  ^^/-\ tiled the chilling storm: the night wind sighed and moaned, as it rushed through the cracks and crannies, and the driving snow piled itself high up about the 'door and upon the heavy window sills, trying to keep the rays of the bright and cheerful fire within from streaming out like a comforting beacon light to the storm beaten wayfarer. The old trees groaned as they bowed to the blast: and the high stacks of chimneys shook under its violence. "God help the poor wayfarer, who is out in this dreadful night!" said Giles Horstead, as he stirred the large fire that burned and crackled so cheerily upon the wide hearth, and drew himself up nearer to it, with his hands outspread as a screen to his rubicund features. "Ough! how  the blast tears it on!" "A bitter night, in sooth, master Horstead, but truly this hot brew of thine warmeth the inner man and maketh the heart feel gracious, verily, and grateful to the good giver of all these creature comforts."    208       WILLITOFT, OR THE "And verily, friend Jedediah, thou art not far wrong. It is a pleasant way of serving the Creator, by enjoying his gifts," replied mine host laughing, "and verily, Jedediah, I will join in this thy worship, though I frequent not thine conventicle." "Blaspheme not sacred things, master Horstead, for thou knowest that the day of regeneration is close at hand, when the saints shall rule." "Godshelp them that are ruled, if your saints are the rulers," said Giles Horstead, good humoredly, as he pro- ceeded to concoct his brew of hot liquor, "and many a long day be it before that come to pass!" "Ha, do you say that? Verily friend Giles, I fear you are popishy inclined. Thou knowest - " A sudden blast of wind broke around the house and ren- dered the voice of the speaker inaudible. Giles Horstead not the less deliberately poured out the hissing and ]team- ing water upon his compound, and taking a long daught, resumed his seat by the cheerful blaze. "Ha, this is comfortable!" he said as the wind died away. At that moment, a figure, wrapped in a rough overall, struggled along on foot through the deep snow that blocked up the road, in the face of the driving sleet and wind, and pressing up to the door of the hostelry rapped earnestly. "Ha! a traveller in such a night as this," said Giles Horstead. "Come in! come in, man!" The stranger entered. His cap and cloak were white with snow, and the coarse shawl, which was bound round his neck, was encrusted with frost and icicles. "Ough!" exclaimed mine host suddenly, " man, you are like an icicle. It chills me through to look at you," and Giles emptied his glass of hot, and sturdily punched the   DAYS OF JAMES I.       209 fire, in order to restore the equilibrium of caloric. "Come shake yourself and thaw your bones at the fire." But the stranger after brushing off the snow, began to walk briskly up and down the floor, avoiding the fire. He endeavored to speak to the host, but his lips were unable to articulate, and only indistinct sounds escaped him. "Zounds! man, you are almost frozen," exclaimed the good natured host, hastily concocting another glass of hot liquor. "Here, take this, it will warm you and do you good." The traveller accepted the glass and drank it slowly and cautiously. In a few moments its revivifying power was apparent, and the traveller returned thanks to the host. "No thanks! no thanks, Sir!" said honest Giles, "it is my business." In a short time, the stranger sat down by the fire, having requested some supper to be prepared for him. After si- lently examining the new comer from head to foot, Jede- diah resumed his discourse; "Yes, master Giles, I fear thou art popishy inclined, and thou knowest that times be not now as they were, since the godly Sir Henry Marsden, and the worshipful Squire Rode- well have been blessed with the true Gospel spirit." The stranger'started for a moment, but quickly resumed an un- concerned expression and gazed quietly into the fire. "Even the high heads are brought low," continued Jede- diah, "and God has given the earth to his saints. He hath commanded them to drive out the sons of Belial from the land of promise and to set themselves down in their plea- sant places. Verily Giles it behooves thee to be prudent, for thou art known to have been a staunch friend of those Philistines, the Scotts." Imperceptible almost was the start of the stranger, at these words, but it was quick and almost convulsive: with 18*   210       WILLITOFT, OR THE a sudden effort he resumed his calmness and the puritan proceeded--"And thou further knowest that thou didst but narrowly escape from sharing their fate.----" "Truly, friend Jedediah, thou dost remind me of most unsavory things," said the honest host, whose bluff face paled a little at some unpleasant recollections which his companion's words excited, "but thou knowest also, good Jedediah, that I am a true hater of the pope, and a good Protestant; and that I did but jest even now, about thine conventicles, where truly the Spirit of the Lord doth dis- play itself in wondrous and unheard-of ways. Wilt thou pledge me in another cup, good Jedediah, for this subject makes one chilly." "Verily thou speakest wisely and bravely, friend Giles; aud I think that thou knowest thy friends from thy enemies." "And wilt thou join us, Stranger?" said the host rising to prepare the drinks. "I thank thee, mine host, for thy proffered kindness, but I pray thee excuse me, the rather that I have eaten nothing for several weary hours." Almost as he spoke, the hostess entered with several rashers of broiled bacon and a pile of good bread and placed them before the hungry traveller, who fell to work upon them with a heartiness of appetite that made the jolly host chuckle as he exclaimed with renewed good humor: "It doth me good to look at thee, friend! For next to the eating a good meal one's self, is the seeing another eat it well and heartily." "Indeed, mine host, I am right glad to please you there- in-it is a great comfort to myself also," said the other mildly and continued his repast in silence. ,At length, Jedediah departed from the hostel, and the traveller having drawn up to the fire commenced to con- verse with Giles Horstead.   DAYS OF JAMES I.       214 "These are unquiet times, mine host." "Ah yes!" said Giles Horstead with a sigh, "but what with popish plots and arrests of traitors, and comings and goings, business thrives somewhat; and though I should be sorry to see friends suffer, you know business is business." "One would suppose this quiet little nook would have escaped the turmoils and dissensions which have afflicted the land." "Here! Lord bless you, Sir! Why it was here that one of the most terrible plots was discovered by master Rodewell, who was rewarded for it too. Terrible it was, for people were engaged in it, whom nobody would have suspected." "Is it possible? Relate it to me, good, mine host," said the stranger, while a dark shadowgathered upon his coun- tenance. "Ah! it is a sad tale, Sir! They were so good, so kind hearted to every one-but then, as Sir Henry says, that was all Jesuitism to seduce the poor people into their plots and plans, and we ought to be thankful that we are to have dif- ferent landlords to deal with." "Different landlords! how mean you?" said the stranger anxiously. "Oh! I thought I had explained it all to you. You must know that some four years ago, it got to be rumored that things were going wrong at the house of Mr. Travers, a confirmed papist: and Sir Henry Marsden and Squire Rodewell, then only master Rodewell, and no richer than I am now, began to inquire about it. After they were satis- fied that Travers was at mischief, they watched a relation of his named Scott, who was my landlord, whose younger son was engaged to Miss Travers, and they found out from a groom that master William Scott, the elder brother, poor young man he was so good and kind-" a flush passed   212       WILLITOFT, OR THE over the features of the stranger, and he turned his head aside for a moment, "that master William had become a papist, and the fellow brought a treasonable book which his master had given him and made affidavit that he had endea- vored to bring him into the conspiracy." "Ha! the base traitor!" murmured the stranger. "Then came treasonable resistance to the law; and 'the Scotts fled. The elder went into foreign parts and became a Jesuit. After their flight large quantities of arms were found secreted on the two estates and the Travers' were arrested with their people. But it seems that the Scotts, the father and the younger son, I mean, had gone to Lon- don and by means of bribery and false representations had got a pardon and protection for their friends. This pardon was afterwards revoked because it had not been properly granted, as master Rodewell says: but the protection was continued, and rested them several years. Master Rode- well then found out that they were at their old doings, and kept a close eye upon them until about three months ago they were all arrested. Mr. Travers, Mr. Scott and George, and even the ladies of the families were thrown into prison with several of the tenants. Papers describing the whole conspiracy with lists of those engaged were found in their houses, and letters which connect them all with William Scott, the Jesuit, who is abroad and was the prime mover of the plot. I don't understand it exactly, but every one says that they will be convicted and executed, and that master Rodewell is to get a grant of part of Scottsfield, Mr. Scott's estate, and Sir Henry will get Willitoft, the place of Mr. Travers.--Are you ill?" exclaimed the host, suddenly interrupting his narrative, as his eye rested upon the features of the stranger. His face was ghastly pale and the muscles worked and quivered with repressed an-   DAYS OF JAMES I.       213 guish. With a strong effort, he pressed his hands upon his brow and said "Nay-nay! it is -momentary, it is over now, pray pro- ceed!" "I like not the subject more than you, Sir, and I will quit it an' it please you, and will show you where you can sleep to yourself, when it lists you to retire," said the host with more kindness and respect than he had before paid to the apparently mean condition of the traveller. "Well, mine host, I will retire at once, for I am worn and weary." "It is wondrous like him," muttered Giles Horstead as be betook himself to sleep. "Poor soul! But think not of it, master Giles, what right hast thou to hunt out resem- blances. Knowledge is dangerous. Art thou a dog, Giles, to scent the hunted hare to his lair? Art thou a blood- hound? Heaven help thee, Giles, and have none of it." And the honest hearted host slept the sounder that night for his generous thought. Worn and weary though he was, it was long before the stranger ceased to pace up and down his little room. He was a man of perhaps thirty years of age-tall and elegantly formed, and though roughly clad there was that ease and grace in all his movements that marked a cultivated and refined mind. His features were thin and pale and bore the impress of long and arduous study. The storm still beat on without, while the traveller, heed- less of his couch, paced on. "Oh my father, my mother, my brother! have the snares of the spoilers encompassed ye?" he exclaimed, as he clasped his handssadly. "But what booteth it? Why weep for the fleeting sorrows of this earth! Ah, it is-a weary pilgrimage, and wo unto him who passeth on with.   214       WILLITOFT, OR THE out trials and tribulations! Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth. The storms of winter rage, and the snows fall, and the earth is desolate: but the breath of spring cometh in beauty thereafter, and the things of earth bud, bloom, and bring forth fruit. Let me not weep; let me rather rejoice, for this sorrow is full of hope! Oh, my mother, how have I sighed and wept and prayed for thee, in the hours of the night that thine eyes might be opened, and now, now, the hand of the Lord hath answeredt; for the bruised flower sendeth up its sweetest perfume, and the chastened heart listeneth to the voice of God." Then he knelt in silent prayer, and tears flowed down his pale cheeks, whilst his uplifted face glowed with holy enthusiasm. At length he arose and sought his couch. "My father's house is desolate, but blessed are they who mourn for they shall be comforted; and blessed are they who suffer for justice' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of God-! Happier thou, my father, in thy dungeon if there thou shalt find the truth, than he that hath unrighteously possessed himself of thy cheerful home! May Heaven bless thee, and pardon him." And he composed himself to sleep with a resigned and Christian spirit. Morning came, and the storm had passed. The cold, bright sun was glancing on the drifting snow, which cover- ed the fields and the house-tops and the fences with one changeless glare of white, and clung to the leafless limbs of the gaunt trees, or drove fiercely upon the sudden blasts of chill wind that whistled now and then around the host- elry. Wrapped in his coarse mantle, the wanderer issued from the door, cast a glance upon the sky and upon the unbroken road deep with drift,--and then passed forward upon his toilsome and cheerless way. His route led him within sight of Scottsfield: he turned to gaze upon it. The   DAYS OF JAMES I.       215 smoke was wreathing up merrily from the tall stacks of chimneys: servants passed to and fro as of old. Four years had passed since last he had gazed upon that dear familiar spot--the home of his childhood. "Without, it seemed as then it did when he turned to cast back his long adieus to those whom he left behind him.-Within! ah, many a change! How many an hour of sadness had passed there since then! How many a bitter pang for him, had wrung the hearts of those he loved! None, whom he knew and loved, were there now; and he was a stranger even in his birth-right and before his father's halls. The wanderer bowed his head and wept! "Was it through me that desolation came? Did my deeds bring sorrow on my father's house? Alas! be it so!" and he shook away the tears, " for thou, O Christ, art my father and my mother, my sister and my brother, and I will bring a rich gift to them who have been despoiled for me. I will pray thee to let me repay them an hundred fold-to give them riches which the thief cannot steal, nor the fire destroy, nor the world take away: and thou wilt hear my prayer! I will bear them thy holy word!" And the wanderer turned once more upon his path, calm, erect and tranquil, repeating in a low voice: " And every one that hath left house, or brethren or sis- ters, or father, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive-a hundred fold and shall possess life everlasting!" 'What to him was the sorrow in that household! What, the loss of fortune! What, the dispersion of his family and friends! What, the dungeon! What, danger and suffering? If hope and life and love ended on this earth, then indeed \ had that hour been bitter, and that last look been sad and cheerless.   216       WILLITOFT, OR THE The wanderer passed on.-He stood by the hearth stone of the little cottage where the Hurlstones had lived; it was coldand deserted, in ruins. He toiled up the road to the gates of Wititoft: it was in the hands of strangers. "I have paid my duty to earth, and now for my duty to heaven. I have brought them my spouse, and they are not here to receive her. I have kept my promise, I will fulfil my mis- sion!" In the dining room of Scottsfield, were seated master Rodewell and John Foxly. They were discussing a smok- ing breakfast of game, supported by foaming flagons of stout ale. "Well, Squire, I did not expect, four years ago, that our adventures down here would end so pleasantly," said Foxly. "Ha, John, they have not terminated yet," replied his companion with a knowing shake of the head. "CNo-not yet!" muttered a voice, inaudible to the speakers, from behind the tapestry at the end of the room. "No, not yet, John," continued Rodewell, balancing the silver tankard before him in a very complacent manner, "and I hope to show you a bit of manceuvring, that will surprise you-when it is done." "And Squire, how is it, now, that we hold this place? Is there really any truth in the common rumor about the grant?" "Nonsense, John, we are holding as officers/of the law, to prevent waste, pillage and profusion, John--ha! ha! ha! That is good, now: is it not?-to preserve the property for the benefit of the Crown when the conviction and the con. fiscation take place." "I suspect you, master Rodewell, curse me if I don't. You are playing a double game! If you are, I will mark   DAYS OF JAMES 1.       217 you. I want my full share of the spoils and will not be put off with less." "Aye, John, who got the splendid silver vase, that was- lost, I suppose, lost only of course, John, you know, and the cups? And who took charge of the loose gold in the drawers and escritoires--not evei the half of which I have been able to find-without mentio ing the old wine, which of course was not sent off and sold. Ah, you are an ar- rant rogue, my fine friend, and take good care to pay your- self well for your roguery, while I am looking after our joint interests, and devil a ha'penny worth have I found yet." "Oh, you make much ado about a few gimcracks, which some of the servants probably carried off, and some bottles of old wine which our fellows drank, I suppose." "Well, certainly, it must be so: and we will let it pass, John, and drop the subject," replied Rodewell, laughing triumphantly. "With all my heart, Squire," said Foxly, glad to accept the compromise. "When we convict these people, Sir Henry pays us a cool thousand down?" "A thousand down, master John, what say you to that? And you know the Secretary has promised us places to re- ward us for our zeal in discovering that terrible popish plot! and conspiracy, ha! ha! ha!" "Poor devils! I pity them, though," replied Foxly, join- ing in the laugh of his superior. "Pah!-pity! That is a rare jest for you, John. You know that I am in the commission now, and, that after the matter is ended, you obtain a snug place in London. 'Well, how easily we evaded that cursed pardon which baffled us long ago. It was fraudulently obtained and of course readily revoked. This you know, John, after Lo described the estates of Willitoft, and their value if sequestrated and 19   "18g      WILLITOFT, OR THE' sold. 'Sir Henry's account of the whole affair, together with those old affidavits which we obtained long ago, clear- ed the way very easily." "And the book?" "Oh, the book was capital. It was laid before the king himself, God bless him t and he swore ,' by God's justice,' he would hang the man who dared to bring into the king- dom and circulate such damnable heresy and treason. And when he was informed that the elder son of Mr. Scott had become a papist and- had gone abroad as was believed to become a Jesuit or seminary priest, he declared that he would crush the whole brood of them; that there could be no doubt of the existence of a dreadful conspiracy of which this at Underwood was only a ramification, if such an apos- tate was concerned; and that if he came into his realm, the villain should be hanged, drawn and quartered."' "The groom is safe of course and will stick to his story?" 1 :That he will, or hang: for his affidavit and your evi- dence will keep him right. The indictment will be for trea- son, and there are besides some half dozen other charges: but the first is strongly enough supported by the case we have made out. The letters and papers our London friend prepared for us will fix the matter for ever." "I don't relish this strong game altogether," said Fox'y, musing. "Pah! You might snwear that the Pope was marching at the .head of an invisible army to dethrone the king, and every body would believe or pretend to believe it, which is as good for our purpose. Why, would you credit it? all London is bristling with arms because it is reported that the Spaniards have sent some ship loads of pocket pistols into this country for the papists to murder the Protestants with!" * See note. X I    DAYS OF JAMES I.       219 i; What an idea!" exclaimed Foxly laughing. "And all too from our conspiracy, John: those pocket pistols which you found four years ago, in the places- where you had put them-have grown into many ship loads just landed. I would not be surprised in time, to hear of I worse conspiracies, and more concealed arms and amniu- nition suddenly discovered just when they are needed. What a grand idea it would be, when the king's secretaries wish to have the popular frenzy at their control, for them to do oal a grand scale what we have done on a small scale!" "' Yes, but how could it be effected?" * Easily! See, I will sketch you a plan at once," con- tinued Rodewell, after a moment's thought. "The people are anxiou to believe themselves in danger-that -is humanJ nature-anid they readily believe any thing that tends to prove it. Well, now, instead of our beggar acting upou puritan Jedediah-we will send an agent to find out some Catholic gentleman, broken down, half crazed by suffering and persecution. We will rouse his misty brain to wild frenzy--we will assure him that such and such Catholic noblemen and gentlemen are in the plot, and that he is selected as the heaven chosen instrument of God's ven- geapce. Nay, we can even personate these nobles and gentlemen by other agents if necessary to carry out the scheme; we canl then make the arrangements for his shootr ing at the king-but no! To se'cure his purpose he might load the pistol himself and fatal consequences ensue. Stay - -I have it! It is grand and safe. Suppose we make the object of the plot to destroy the whole parliament as well as the king? Such an excitement would last the kingdom for ages to come whenever it would be wanted: and would take the fancy of a crazy man at once. Well, we pursue our old plan further. We put some barrels of gunpowder   220         WILLITOFT, OR THE under the parliament house, and our crazy man is to fire them whenever the king opens the parliament." "Aye, but suppose he does it! It would be horrible!" "Yes, but he won't do it.  We must have the plot re- vealed in time.  We will write a letter full of mysterious warning to some Catholic noble cautioning him not to be there at the meeting. This Catholic noble-any one of them, in his officious patriotism will hasten to involve his friends in the trap laid for them; he will at once commu- nicate the letter to the government and express his fears that some mysterious danger is impending. Search is made at the right time, and lo! the crazy desperado is found in the midst of all his preparations for blowing up the king and parliament. The country becomes frantic; universal per- secution becomes the order of the day. And, John Foxly, such men as you and I prosper without all these long de- lays and petty plots. The nation has something with which it can frighten itself ad libitum for a hundred years to come, when ever the government chooses." By heaven, the idea * The writer has not attempted to adhere to chronology in a mere work of fiction. He has, therefore, used events without regard to dates. Thus, Swithin Wells, whose name is introduced in these pages, suffered martyrdom in 1791. For the account of his life and sufferings, see Bishop Challoner's ;, Missionary Priests," vol. 1, p. 247.

The gunpowder plot above alluded to, was discovered Nov. 5th, 1605, therefore prior to the supposed time of the conversation in the text, although the author has spoken of it as not yet in existence. It is no longer. a question of doubt, that Cecil, the Secretary of State, was at least cognizant of this infamous plot from its very inception, and assisted to mature it for purposes of State as set forth in the conversation of Rodewell: and there is strong reason to believe, that it was even origi- nated by his agents, and that mad Guy Fawkes, and Catesby and his reckless associates, were inveigled into it. The following is part of a quotation from the ' Political Grammar," taken from , Missionary Priests," p. 13, vol. 2.

"I will treasure up your words-for you are a Solomon," said Foxly seriously. "But come, it is time for us to visit Sir Henry and press on our present arrangements." The two villains left the room: whilst from the tapestry -emerged Edward Hurlstone, pale and emaciated. He strode towards the table, grasped a portion of the food, and re- turned to his hiding place. Sir Henry was all smiles to master Rodewell.   "Good master Rodewell-master justice, I believe!--you have, in- deed, managed this affair admirably. I have received a letter from one of the Secretaries commending the energy and zeal of certain parties here--ahem! Indeed I may say, that I am indebted to you for the high' compliments which he has paid me." "By no means, Sir Henry," replied Rodewell, with well assumed sincerity. "They are earned by your own exceed- ing merit. Indeed I could not repeat to you the enco- private papers) that the minister was acquainted with the conspirators' Journal from the beginning; so that he might easily have stifled the design in its infancy:' but that would not quadrate with his principal design, which was to divert King James from making any approaches towards Popery (to which he seemed to be inclined in that minister's opinion) by engaging some papists in a desperate and horrid plot to destroy both king and parliament. This was the original of that affair, which has filled the kingdom with astonishment for above a whole cen- tury." Bishop Challoner says--"that Mr. Osborn has informed the world long ago, that this plot was, as he terms it, a neat device of the Secretary; and King James the First, himself, was so sensible of it, that he used to call the 5th of November, Cecil's holiday." The plots of Oates and Bedloe and others as infamous were but mea- sures of a similar stamp, but carried the idea so far, that no folly and bigotry were bad enough to continue to be their dupes to the end. The plots got up in Ireland by the English agents, have often borne testi- mony to a similar infamous and unscrupulous policy. 19*   222       WILLITOPT, OR THE miums which the same secretary passed upon you whilst arranging the matter with me." "Every thing is ready for the trial, is it not?" "Heaven help us, such is- the excitement, at this time, against the papists, that we need only prove the parties to be papists toprove our case. We, by that, will establish presumptions in the minds of the jury which the accused must rebut. Papacy is now prima facie evidence of con- spiracy and treason; indeed they are -considered one and the same thing before our courts and juries. Beside, you know, if further evidence is needed, the rack will produce it. The rack is something like the trial of witchcraft by water. If the accused persist in his innocence, he will die under the torture, if he confess guilt, he will die by the hand of the executioner, and either will serve our purpose." "What mean you, Sir, by our purpose? You forget!" said the baronet superciliously, with one of his dark frowns. (' Oh no! not at all, Sir Henry. I have an excellent me- mory. We are both magistrates," replied Rodewell calmly. "Ha! the villain-presumptuous already! But I must use him yet awhile," muttered the baronet. "My memory is most retentive, I assure you," continued Rodewell. ' For instance, Sir Henry, peruse this." And he handed him a slip of paper somewhat old and faded. "Ha! ' Willitoft ---  acres, income per annum: adjoins the lands of Housewell at the Holly tuft and runs thence by and with the said land two miles, well suited for unidon-into one estate, &c. &c.!V" The face of the baron- et flushed and then paled. Suddenly he resumed his com- posure. "Well, Sir, what of this! some impertinence, I take it 1" "Sir Henry recognizes the hand-writing to be his own?"   DAYS OF JAMES I.       223 ' Rather like a clumsy limitation," replied the baronet, after a moment's hesitation. "But I see little importance in it, at all events." O "Oh, certainly," said Rodewell carelessly. "Only this. The famous conspiracy which Sir Henry has so zealously hunted out, might, we will suppose, turn out to be no con- spiracy at all. Certain representations might be made to the Secretary and certain processes and warrants and ar- rests and imprisonments and prosecutions be brought to light, which this paper would explain in a singular manner: Scottsfield also adjoins Housewell, and Scott is not a papist, though Travers is, and there are such things as misdemean- ors, damages for malicious prosecutions, &c. &c." "Devil. What mean you?" exclaimed Sir Henry, rising from his chair, and pacing the floor hurriedly, while his hands trembled as he clutched the paper, and he muttered, "Horror! horror! All my schemes in that man's hands. Fool that I was. To be discovered on the verge of triumph!" "What mean I, Sir Henry?" replied Rodewell coolly. "I mean to prove that the destruction of these people, in- nocent or guilty, would suit us both equally well. That paper would be an excellent piece of evidence at the trial, connected with some facts I am acquainted with. How much, think you, Scott would pay for it?" "Villain, name, your price!" said the baronet hurriedly, and thrown off his guard.' "Well, Sir Henry, though I have no estate to tack it to,. I should be well satisfied to hold Scottsfield. I am pleased with the house and would be loath to leave it. It would suit my new commission well," replied Rodewell, very coolly." "Presumptuous!" muttered the baronet, half aloud. "You must aspire to be a landholder!" i    224       WILLITOFT, OR THE "Why, Sir Henry," said Rodewell quietly, "it seems to me that you old landholders consider the poor papists your exclusive prey. We petty, poor villains, come in but for the offal of the plunder. You are the lions who monopo- lize all that is valuable. When. the abbeys were robbed by a royal rogue, because they were said to be too rich for the prosperity of the realm, the poor received no share: they had enjoyed benefits from the monasteries, they were plun- dered too, and these riches-houses and lands were thrown with prodigal hand into the. laps of court favorites, who became hard and griping masters to the poor. We of the people received no share, though the deed was done, it was professed, for our benefit. This same system has ever since been pursued. The penal laws are only to be used for the benefit of the rich and the titled. I mean to alter this. I mean to secure sotiething for myself-who am one of the people. Is not this fair and equitable?" Sir Henry mused for a moment and then strode towards the fire-place and cast the paper into the flames--"There, presumptuous! There seek your evidence. Thus end your schemes! and learn to be moderate in your expectations. You shall have what you ought to receive, no more!". The scroll shrivelled and burst into a flame, then blackened, and its cinders -rushed up the strong draught of the chimney. "Ha! ha I ha!" laughed Rodewell without making any effort to secure the paper. * "And now, Sir'" said the baronet triumphantly, "let this conspiracy turn out to be a fraud upon the public, and there are certain affidavits obtained by one master Rode- well, wholferreted out this whole matter, and upon whom must rest the responsibility of the crime and the punish- ment consequent upon it. I believe there is enough- evi- dence to hang him in case, only in case, this conspiracy   DAYS OF JAMES I.       225 turns out to have been manufactured by him." He said sarcastically in the tone Rodewell had used: "Rodewell will see that Sir Henry Marsden is not to be trifled with, and that he will make his tools-his tools-do their duty. The conspiracy must have been real-as master Rodewell discovered it; and master Rodewell will not fail to substan- tiate his charges against the traitors. Fool, to think I could be duped thus!" "Sir Henry is complimentary!" said Rodewell still calm and unruffled. "I certainly would have deserved the epi- thet he has bestowed upon me, had I been stupid enough to place the original paper in his hands. The copy was exceedingly well executed, it is true, by a friend of mine in London, who has marked thee original which I preserve with the greatest care. Indeed, my friend deserves great credit for his skill, for the copy has deceived Sir Henry himself." "Devil! You lie!" exclaimed the baronet furiously. "That was the original.! I have missed it. I did not think vou had stolen it. Now it is safe, ha! ha! ha!" "I can assure you, Sir Henry, you are mistaken. It was only a clumsy imitation, you know. But you acknowledge the paper is in your hand-writing. See here it is!'"He opened his vest and took from a side pocket a letter case from which he selected the paper and held it before Sir Henry. The movement displayed a formidable pair of pistols in his belt. The baronet sprang forward; but Rodewell laid his hand upon the butt of a pistol saying,-"Beware, SirHenry!" The baronet sat down sullenly, and, pressing his hands upon his face, said: "It-is all a forgery, a miserable forgery!" "You admitted its truth just now." "If I am guilty you are equally so, villain, and therefore I am safe."   226       WILLITOFT, OR THE "Sir Henry forgets; I am only a poor devil, he is rich and in high station. I am but a tool, b;e the man who uses me for his own ends; and the tool not being worth a pro- secution, might turn king's evidence against his rich em- ployer who might have his lands forfeited perhaps. Ha, Sir Henry, you start!---And the tool might be pardoned and receive a handsome reward from Mr..Scott for his timely interference. You know it is never the greatest villain that escapes thus, Sir Henry." "Rail on,'I am in your power," said the baronet sullenly. "Nay, Sir Henry, I would be your friend,.not your ene- my; our interests are the same, and if Sir Henry will consent to unite them, I pledge my honor that they shall succeed." "Honor among thieves, I suppose," said Sir Henry bit- terly. "Oh! certainly! if Sir Henry likes it thus. But then we are thieves upon a very peculiar principle and on a large scale." One of his dark frowns gathered upon the face of the baronet: but he only answered, "Give me the paper and I pledge you to forward your plans as well as my own." "It is very safe in my hands," replied Rodewell, "but as soon as Scottsfield becomes mine, it shall be destroyed in your presence, and my lips shallobe for ever sealed upon these things." "You will burn another copy, I suppose." "No; the original, I swear to you!" "Be it so, then," replied the baronet gloomily, " we are friends and allies per force. How shall we proceed?" "Ah that sounds like business," said Rodewell keeping his eye on the baronet. "I believe you can command at any time from five to ten thousand pounds." The baronet   i DAYS OF JAMES I.       227 started but did not reply. "Upon the conviction there will be a forfeiture to the Crown and a sale of the estates --" "Unless a grant be obtained --" "No! my plan is surer and safer, though a little expen- sive. After all, you know, it requires a heavy bribe to ob- tain a grant. Now, you have great credit with the Secretary in this matter. I shall take care that you get more, and there will be a desire to reward you. I shall have the es- tates represented as nearly worthless in their present con- dition and paint the tenantry in such a light that no one will compete for the purchase of the property. If any one offer, you will find him withdraw his offer very speedily. You will bid, say five thousand pounds for the estates, I will put in for four thousand, others for three, two, and so on. You will of course get the estates, 'and then you will convey Scottsfield to me in pursuance of an article of sale, which you will execute to me, the date of which I will fill up at the proper time. You see, Sir Henry, I am generous and trust in your honor." "Ah! very indeed! And where shall, I get my twenty- five hundred pounds from again?" "Oh! Sir Henry, Willitoft is worth twenty times that sum, and my services in obtaining it for you deserve a hand- some reward." "Well, well! be it so, if so it must be!" said the baronet, as he paced across the floor, muttering a thousand curses on his ill-fortune, as he called it. Suddenly, he paused, and taking fro-m the table a -copy of the Bible which rested habitually there, he exclaimed: "I must have your solemn oath that you will play me fair in this matter!" "Oh, in good sooth, Sir Henry, I will swear to any thing you please-Any thing," said Rodewell laughing. '.39  I       -228   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I. "Tush!" exclaimed the baronet, casting down the book -"What can bind a man like you?" "My interest, Sir Henry, I assure you," replied Rode- 'well, unblushingly. "Make it my interest, and I am yours for ever." "Till the Devil gets you," said the baronet pettishy. "Still yours, Sir Henry, as fast and close as ever." "Let him laugh who wins," thought Rodewell as he part- ed from Sir Henry, and returning to his companion below stairs, he set out for Scottsfield. "Double dyed villain!" muttered the circumvented ba- ronet, as he paced the floor of his library in sullen passion. "Yet it is worth even that to me; he is cu'nning, dangerous and unscrupulous. I will use him first, and if I must, why faith it is more prudent to make a friend and supporter of' him afterwards than an enemy. But after all, that such a ruffian should step into the estate of Spottsfield! True, I had not marked it out for myself, but I did not expect it to pass into such hands. Well, well, I may baffle him; but I will use him first at any price." And the discomfitted schemer endeavored to crush in his own mind the con- sciousness that he was no longer the master spirit in the affair, but that he was compelled to bow to one greater in villainy and power than himself. Yet he sought to bury the danger of his situation in the certainty of success. P2"3L   CHAPTER    XIII. THE MSSION OF ENGLAND, IN THE XVIITH CENTURY. Look up! oh! is it-that wan cheek and brow!- Is it-alas i-yet joy! My son! my son!--HEMANs. :  HROUGH the streets of London from Newgate to bloody Tyburn, wound a slow and solemn pro- ! cession. A strong-guard led the way; then came two horses dragging a hurdle, outstretched upon which, with his hoary head striking at every moment upon the rough pavement, was bound an old and venerable man. His hands were clasped upon his breast, his lips com- pressed in agony, his eyes fixed upon heaven, his counte- nance calm save when, at each blow of his dragging head, the muscles of his face started convulsively. His white hair was matted with blood, and the blood marks of his painful passage rested upon the jagged points of the stones. An executioner followed; then came the high sheriff with his guards, accompanied by a man dressed in the robes of a minister of the Established Church. A crowd of idlers followed close upon the guard of honor. Occasionally some mournful looking person would join the group, pause and stoop suddenly, wipe up the blood drops with a white kerchief, press it to his bosom, and hurry away with tears flowing from his eyes and lips moving in prayer, bearing carefully the precious relic of the holy martyr. The citizen, pressing onward with rapid strides along the side-ways, turned to gaze for a moment at the grim spectacle winding slowly on, then perhaps muttering "Bloody papist!" pur- sued his route and dismissed the sufferer from his mind. ! -20   230       WILLITOFT, .OR THE Children young and beautiful, but long since hardened to such sights, shouted, as the pageant went by, "Down with the bloody Pope!"And long lines of windows, for a mo- ment, were filled with fair faces looking curiously to see what manner of man was dying to-day, and then vacated as the line went farther on. Thus passed a human being on to martyrdom, exciting a momentary glance, a shout, a curse, and then, so common a sight had it become, forgotten. At length, impeded by the breaking down of a heavy wain across its route the front of this sad procession paused. The rear pressed on and became confused and intermingled with the people. Suddenly, a figure clothed in black min- gling with the crowd pressed vigorously through it, until it reached the hurdle whereon the martyr was bound. In his hand he held a cup of wine and water: he touched the sol- dier who stood between him and the victim, and, placing a broad gold piece in his hand, besought him in whispered tones to let him pass and offer a draught to the condemned. "No, no!" said the soldier coldly, 'let the bloody papist suffer! The traitor, you shall not offer him consolation." "But I would whisper a single word to him. I pledge you my word it shall harm no living thing." "Let him pass, Tom," said his comrade, "he has done the right thing.-It is permitted to every condemned man to drink his parting cup. It can hurt no one, and the crowd has so pressed up that it will not be perceived." "Thanks, thanks! good soldier!" said the stranger as he stooped down over the sufferer, whose eyes were closed while his lips moved in prayer. "Pax vobis," he whispered. "And with thy spirit!" said the condemned opening his eyes in wonder. "Ah that voice, that face! William, my    DAYS OF JAMES I.       231 son, is it thou for whom I have been awaiting as an angel on my path of sorrow." "Father Tichbourne!" exclaimed the other in astonish- ment. "I knew a priest was to suffer, but not that it was thou. Ah! what a welcome back to England! Thanks to God, that in this hour I may be at thy side and repay thy dear and priceless services to me. But to our duty!" For a moment there passed a rapidly whispered conver- sation. Tlen the stranger raised his hand and said in a low tone, "Absolvo te," and his lips moved quickly in prayer. Then he touched a spring in the cup, a false bot- tom opened, passing into' his fingers a small consecrated host, in a moment more the blessed viaticum rested upon the lips of the martyr. The holy deed was unseen by the the two soldiers, who barely witnessed the cup presented to the lips of the sufferer and heard him reply aloud, "I have received my Lord and my God! I need no other support, no other sustenance, no other comforter!" The obstacle was remove d; the line re-formed; the dis- guised priest passed calmly out from the opening ranks of the soldiery; the hurdle and the victim moved on to the death. Away from the crowded thoroughfare. of death, went William Scott,-down a narrow and dark street: he was, at length, joined by a man in the smock frock of a peasant. "It is over," said the new comer, sadly and reverentially. "Consummatum est," repeated the priest, casting his eyes to heaven; "it is donre; and the soul of the martyr has ascended into heaven. There is another voice before thy throne, O God, to pray for the salvation of England." "Went our plan well, Father?"at length asked the pea-   232       WILLITOFT, OR THE sant, after a pause, as they walked towards the most crowd' ed portion of the city. "It was successful, thank God! Thou didst break down the wain very efficiently. I reached the holy martyr. It was Father Tichbourne! the instrument of my call to the truth and thy return to the faith, Edward Hurlstone! Happy for us, thus to assist him who brought light to us. I min- istered to him!" "Ah, Father, I knew him as he was about to die: his eye rested on me in the cro wd, and extending his hand towards me he gave me his silent blessing!" 'But thou art bruised and beaten, Edward Hurlstone?" said the priest. "In truth, Father Maurus, some of the soldiery did beat and bruise me for breaking down before the procession," replied the other. In silence Father Maurus and Edward Hurlstone walked on, until they reached a large and dilapidated building, be- side which an alley or' court led down some distance from the street. The court was narrow and dark, clouded by the towering roofs on either side, under which swarmed a thick and squalid population. A side door, opening into the alley or court from the large building fronting on the main street, gave them entrance after Edward Hurlstone rapped thrice upon it. Threading their way through a dark and winding passage and ascending several steep and dilapidated stair- ways, they at-length reached a door which Hurlstone open- ed, displaying a touching scene to the eye of Father Maurus. Within the room were ranged benches such as were used for schools, and between the rows of seats, knelt a number of children murmuring the responses of the litany for the dying. One side of the room was only occupied by a chair and a table with a few books upon it: and beside the table   DAYS OF JAMES I.       233 knelt an old man, whose sad but benevolent features, and faltering voice told how deeply he was impressed with the solemnity of the occasion. He paused in his litany as Father Maurus entered the room, and looked anxiously in- to his face awaiting his words. "It is over," said Father Maurus. "It is over, my chiI- dren! The blessed martyr is now with the saints, we must believe. Lest us, therefore, change our tones from sadness to those of joy. Instead of ' De profundis clamavi ad te, Domine,' let us chaunt ' Te Deum laudamus, te Deum glo- rificamus,' for this day has become the feast of a holy mar- tyr-Blessed be the name of the Lord." A low and sorrowful murmur ran, for a moment, through the crowd of youthful hearers; and, then, a sweet sad. voice among them commenced, at first in faltering tones, but clearer and firmer as the-child proceeded, that magnificent chaunt of glory and praise and thanksgiving to God. Tears flowed from their eyes, while their voices, pure and solemn as the voice of such childhood only could be, swelled' up the grand anthein in honor of the martyr's triumph. ," And, now, let us pray for our country and our king," said Father Maurus, and the little assemblage of youths, who were destined hereafter perhaps to tread the path of him for whom they now wept and triumphed, joined in one of those holy and touching prayers which the Catholic Church offers up even for those who persecute her, in imi- tation of her divine Master who prayed to his Father to forgive his executioners--"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!" Then Father Maurus addressed the pupils a short exhor- tation on their duties to God, their king and their own souls, painting to them the self-devotion and purity of life of the holy victim who had just suffered, urging them to 20*   234       WILLTOFT, OR THE imitate his zeal, his patience,- his purity, his devotedness and Aris final perseverance. He told them that God in his own good time would bring peace and happiness to Eng- land once again, and that great things were in store for her in future times, for whom he loved he tried much. Then, after drawing instruction and consolation from the past, and inculcating hopes and confidence for the future, he turned to the- teacher of the little school and said: "Brother, I pray you dismiss your classes, for the day is now well spent, and I have somewhat to say to you." "I will, Father;" and in a few minutes the scholars had departed by several passages, and, mingling-in the crowds who pressed along the thoroughfare, hastened to their homes;--homes, some of which displayed affluence and wealth, some substantial independence, some poverty, des- titution, -and affliction, but all of which were the dwellings of the faithful and the proscribed, whose children came to- gether without other distinction but that of merit in this hidden and unsuspected nook to receive the benefits of a Catholic education from one whose penalty for teaching, if discovered, was the gallows at Tyburn. Such was the Ca- tholic school of that day, and for a many a long year after- wards: and, in spite of this, there were Catholic schools in England, and brave and pious Catholic gentlemen who i  risked their lives to teach, and noble and heroic'youth who perilled all to learn; and thus prepared to go abroad to make their studies in the. English Colleges established on the continent, to seek ordination and to return to serve or suffer for their brethren in the faith. No wonder, then, that the iron hand of persecution could not utterly crush out the faith of England. After a few moments of thought, Father Maurus address- ed the teacher:   DAYS OF JAMES I.       235 "I have learned from your associate Edward Hurlstone, !  Mr. Wells, that he is acquainted with many of the prisons where our poor brethren are confined, he has this day prov- ed himself a skilful assistant to me upon my perilous mis- sion, and I wish to ask your assent that he may accompany me for a time, to guide me in my visits to them." "I accord it willingly," replied the teacher, with much courtesy of manner. "Let him go whither he can be of most service! Sad is the fate of those who are incarcerated, and holy is the deed of him who brings joy and consolation to their hearts.--But when do you set forth?" "This day, even yet!" replied Father Maurus. "Be advised by me, reverend Father! Tarry till to-mor- row at the least, at my house. There is a welcome, there, ever for thee." "I do not doubt it: but thou knowest, Mr. Wells, that thou hast been in trouble, already, several times for receiv- ing our brethren, and I would not willingly bring thee again ill peril." "Thou canst not refuse, reverend Father," replied Swi- thin Wells, " for there are several who are desirous of spi- ritual consolation who will be glad to meet thee at my poor house in Holborn. It is near Grays-inn-fields." "Then, I will accompany thee."  "Nay, thou wilt follow me with Edward Hurlstone, going out by the- same way you entered. I pass by a different route." The three separated; and Father Maurus, with his com- panion, pursued the direction to Holborn. They reached the house, which Hurlstone knew well, and were received by Mr. Wells who had already arrived. Mrs. Wells, a pious and devoted woman, welcomed them with joy. A few Ca- tholics gradually assembled. That night Father Maurus   236       WILLITOFT, OR THE   -  heard their confessions: and early on the ensuing morning celebrated Mass, at which this little congregation received the holy communion with great and edifying fervor. An hour passed; the worshippers had departed, the busy hum of life had already enveloped the great city, and Father Maurus and his companion wended their way through the crowded streets towards the north. At length, London lay far behind them, and they stood for a moment upon a swell- ing height to cast a last glimpse upon the city ere they again resumed their weary course towards the object of their mission. As they stood thus musing, a rustling in the hedge at the road side attracted their attention, and they beheld, emerging from an opening in the thorny barrier, the figure of a man attenuated with want and sickness, and clothed in miserable attire. ;' What, then, is life," he muttered as he stood and gazed down upon the rich and prosperous city, without perceiving the travellers, who stood above him on the ascent, "What then is life? Cato was weary, and he died. The end of all our woes is in our reach whenever we will stretch forth to grasp it. In yonder river I could drown all sorrow, quench this raging thirst, satisfy this famine which Consumes me; doff these filthy rags and find forgetfulness; and yet I linger! Ah but, if this faith, this unbelief, which I have taught myself be false, if the Christian should be right; then, ah then, I leap but into deeper never-ending wo! And yet these Christians, there, have wealth and give it not. I am hungry and they feed me not, I am thirsty and they give me not drink, I am naked and they clothe me not. I am too proud to beg; I will not steal. Then death must come at last. So, Alton, cheer up thy heart and end all struggles now." And starting forward, he bent his steps- towards the river.                     b*   DAYS OF JAMES I.       237 "Stay, hold! unfortunate man!" exclaimed Father Mau- rus, who had heard this wild soliloquy in amazement. "Stay, rash man! and hear me!" "Who art thou?" said the stranger, pausing. "What wantest thou?" "Thou art unhappy, I wduld comfort thee!" "Comfort! Aye with words! I heed not now such com- fort," he said moodily. "In words and deeds to the extent of my poor means," replied Father Maurus kindly, " whoever thou art. What- the features--very lineaments-and yet, alas, how changed! Alton, Alton! dost thou not know me?" Alton looked fixedly upon his face for a moment and then pressed his attenuated hand upon his brow. "It cannot be; it cannot be ---" he said. "Yes. I am William Scott," replied Father Maurus, taking him kindly by the hand. "Now, now, indeed, it is time for me to die," exclaimed the unhappy man, sinking upon the grass, "for thou hast seen nle fallen and degraded to the lowest 'depths." "Cheer up! cheer up, my friend! It is time for thee to begin to live. Thou hast not fallen beyond mercy, or too far for hope. Come let us in to yonder coppice." They sat down in a secluded spot upon the grass, and Edward Hurlstone, drawing forth from his wallet some pro- visions spread them before the wretched man. When he had satisfied- his hunger, he sat absorbed in silent thought, until tears at length coursed down his cheek. "Ah! it is long since I have felt the luxury of tears!" he said, as Father Maurus pressed his hand kindly. "But my heart is softened by the memory of other days when, prosperous and happy, we roved together. Folly and mad-   -238       WILLITOFT, OR THE ness have done their work. I am fallen and an outcast.- You are unchanged and happy." '"Nay! I am sad, for I weep for the woes of many. But in my own heart I find peace, for I have faith and hope," said Father Maurus gently. "I have thought of you sometimes in my mad career," said Alton sadly; "' and have wondered how those doubts which once possessed you, as I thought, had terminated." "As yours would, did you but reason justly with yourself." "The habit of doubting makes one doubt even his doubt." "Then cease to doubt and seek for faith. With it the ills of life are nothing, without it they are intolerable." "I have felt them so, and had I not doubted even my doubts, I had ended them ere now." "Oh, you have yet the seed of faith in your mind! Let us pray to God to give peace and light to your heart." "What avails it?" replied Alton moodily. "Will God heed us, the miserable worms of the earth? But pray,- you are good,-and I will join in your prayer." Father Maurus knelt down, and slowly repeated the "Our Father," and the "Hail Mary." Then arising, he resumed the conversation. "And you have suffered much, my old friend!" "Yes," replied Alton sadly. "But it was the conse- quence of my own error and folly. I had taught myself to believe, and I remember how the avowal of that belief shocked and terrified4you years ago, that man's passions and desires were given to him for his gratification, and that God would not heed or mark his doings. I gave a loose rein to my passions; every wish I sought to indulge, every desire I hastened to satiate. And behold the result! I fourid many companions in my revelries, who joyously re- echoed my sentiments, and willingly hurried me into every   DAYS OF JAMES I.       239 excess. I found no pleasure, buft I sought for distraction. My theory taught me that such a life must be happiness; I found only disappointment and satiety, and instead of con- * eluding from this the error of my principles, and coming to the belief that happiness was only to be found by man, in higher and better things, I plunged still deeper into the vortex in the pursuit of that fancied bliss, which I argued must be found at length in pleasure. I drank the very lees and dregs: it was in vain. When I awoke from my frenzy, I found myself degraded, penniless, ruined, and an outcast. My late companions scorned me in the streets. Every re- source was exhausted, and I dragged on my life in misery. I fled to the river to bury my woes in its bosom. Then my heart, taught by sad experience, revolted from my proud reason, and made me pause. I hurried to this solitude to think, to meditate before the fatal plunge, and at length de- spair was about to urge me try the unk'nown future to rid me of present ills, when your voice arrested me. But alas! to what purpose?" "For a good purpose, Alton trust me, it is the. mercy of God!" "And you! William Scott! how is it with you?" said Alton, "How have your years passed since last we met?' William Scott related to him his departure for the conti- nent, the sufferings of his family and friends, and after giv- ing an account of his conversion, he concluded: "I am a Catholic priest! ---" "You! a priest!" interrupted Alton, in amazement. "Ah I see it. You could not follow me; your reason would not permit you to remain half way, upon the plat- form of the Church of England, and so you followed reason back to the Church of Rome, while I went forward from doubt to disbelief."   240       WILLTTOFT, OR THE "Say not disbelief! Alton, for the voice of nature tells you there is a God, an infinite, an omnipotent and eternal  a Being." "Yes. I have never doubted that, at least never believed that doubt, even if I boasted it. But I have doubted that he heeds or, marks our acts, or sufferings. And yet the fate of those who suffer in this world must be sad, if in the r next there is no recompense. And I could doubt that jus- tice which in this life distributes woe to some and happi- ness to others, and in the future, if there be a future, metes out to each the same reward: there must be rewards and punishments." "Yes, Alton, suffering and misfortune have opened your eyes to the sophistries which blinded your reason. There is a God. He is infinitely just, merciful and good, as well as powerful: otherwise he would not be a perfect Being, as God must be. *What! can you believe that those who have wronged and deceived you, and are'now perhaps pros- pering on your plunder, will bear the same lot, hereafter, as the patient, just, and pious man who suffers a whole life of sorrow for the love of God? Oh! no! What are the goods of life? temporary and fleeting. What the sorrows? tempo- rary and fleeting too;' and both are given with graces to use the one and endure the other in such a manner as to secure happiness hereafter. It is not prosperity and misery in this life that are to be the means and measure of happiness here- after, but virtue and vice. Virtue is the only good, sin the only evil. Virtue may wear the crown and regal robes, and sin may lurk under the garb of the most wretched. "Man is the highest order of created beings: he has not only life, but a soul which is immortal. God made him in his own likeness; and hence, nothing but God is the fit object of man's life. The love of God can alone give hap- 4   BAYS OF JAMES I.       241 prness to the soul. Is it not wonderful that no human be- ing ever found happiness, nay even satisfaction and content; in the pursuit and possession of material things or- worldly. triumphs. Alexander conquered tMhe world, but wept that ,there were no more worlds to conquer. You have seen enough of life to know from your own experience, as-well as from that of others, that possession palls, and the attain- ment of a desired thing soon brings satiety; and new de- sires spring up to lead on to farther pursuit. The soul, acquire what you may, is ever crying out with impatient voice, more, more; Excelsior, Excelsior! And why is this? Because, like the needle to the pole, its desires, cover it as you may, and even when the surrounding attrac- tions of earth make it quiver for a moment from its course, ever point to the infinite centre of its tendency, to its God. You cannot smother this voice of the soul; and this voice was given by an All-wise Creator for an all-wise purpose. It is the command to love God, which he himself has im- pressed in every heart. And what is it to love God? It is to worship and obey him. Love implies duties to the ob- ject of love: and love in return from God to the creature. Duties to the Creator and love of the Creator for the crea- ture, imply sin on the part of the creature who neglects to perform those duties or who despises and offends that love, and sin necessarily begets punishment. But as God is in- finite in his perfections and his goodness towards man, the offence against him becomes infinite in its guilt and enor- mity; and although his mercy is infinite, his justice is also infinite, and, when the sinner by his hardened impenitence has rejected and trampled upon this mercy, Infinite Justice seizes him and awards him a punishment proportioned to the. infinitude of his offence. What more rational than-this, my friend?" 21              e   2?4       WILLtTOFTI OR THE "Yeas. It is indeed, t fear so," replied Alton, '"In *ptosperity we: reason differently in adversity our eyes view things in- another light, In prosperity, we think- we can live without the interference of God; and that the world is sufficient" for-us. But, when in adversity the world has cast us -off, we have nothing left but God to turn to. The heart must hove something to cling to, and so we turn to God." "Blessed and true is that thought, Alton! and happy the adversity that has proven to you that God, and his love, and hope and faith in his protection aild interference, are neces- sary for man. "If God has loved us, when he created us; when he made us immortal, if his love has given us duties to per- form, his love would not permit us to remain in ignorance of those duties. He has therefore revealed to mnan his will. "Sin is in the world; how came it? The first created fell, they sinned against the command of God. That offence was infinite, for it was an offence against infinite love and infinite goodness and justice. And -infinite justice could only be satisfied by an infinite atonement. God could alone satisfy for/ the sin against God. Infinite mercy brought down from heaven the Son of God, God himself, to take the form of-man, and infinite justice immolated that God- man upon the cross for the sins of the world. Admit the existence of a God, a Supreme Being, and his attributes flaw from his existence, are the parts of it, so to call them; and from the sin against them, necessarily follows the divi- nity of the Saviour who died to atone for them: from the divinity of the Saviour, the absolute and infallible truth of all hisv words, of the religion which he established and the faith which he commanded his apostles and their succes- sora to tpreach to all the world. Oh, Alton, these are not arguments, they are mere recitals-and the simple state-   , DAYS OF JAMES I.       243 ment is of itself the strongest argument. Need I argue to you? Think on these points, dwell on them, develope them, my friend, and pray to God to give you light to find the truth." Alton sat silent with his face resting in his hands! At length, he raised his head, and exclaimed, "Oh, that I could be a Christian, oh that I had your calm, reliant, immovable faith I How happy you must be! How miserable am I! My heart tells me by this even, that I have been wrong, that reason has proved to me a will-o'-the- wisp, a deceitful light, and led me to discontent, inquiet- ude of heart, and despair, even in my prosperous days- Faith has given you content and happiness. Even in the midst of persecution and misfortune, in peace you have possessed your soul." "And now my friend we must part," said Father Maurus. "4 Share my purse until better days dawn upon you-nay no refusal! it is a friend's-and," he continued writing a note upon a leaf torn from his tablets, " bear this to my friend Mr. Swithin Wells. He will aid you in your inquiries, and be of service in securing you some situation, where by ho- norable exertions you may retrieve the past." "Oh! my dear friend,.this is goodness and love. I will accept your kindness--for it will enable me to become de- pendent upon myself -alone." "( Farewell, Alton! we will meet again, I pray-and may God in his mercy finish the good work of your conversion and lead you to the truth. Then you, too, in peace will possess your soul. Farewell!" "Farewell, my friend!" With slow and thoughtful step, and with changed heart, Alton turned towards London, while Father Maurus and his companion resumed their pilgrimage.   244;      WILLITOFT,- OR. THE ;"There is a Catholic house on our road, Father Mairus," said Edward Hurlstone, as they walked in the direction of Oxford, "which we shall probably reach towards noon. There we can obtain refreshments and a moment's rest." "Nay," replied Father- Maurus, "I will not enter the house of these people to bring destruction upon them. Thou shalt lead- them to me in the fields, where I will cate- chize and instruct them while we rest." "They are poor people, Father, and few will think of persecuting them." - "But thou knowest that of late the poor, as well as the rich, have been- persecuted, and I would not willingly ex- pose these good persons to danger." They continued their journey steadily, until the sun rose high in the heavens and the day was half spent. At length, as they were ascending a little eminence the summit of which was crowned by a wood, Edward Hurl- stone said, . .. "We are now within a mile of the house of which I spoke. From, the summit of this hill we will see its pretty thatched roof, with its chimney sending up a clear column of smoke into the cold March air." 'In a few minutes they reached the top of the ascent, and could plainly see the little cottage surrounded by leafless trees and shrubbery, but every thing seemed silent and de- serted around it. No cheerful column of smoke played above its desolate roof-but the same cold, lifeless, wintry aspect hung over the little valley." "It is strange," said Edward Hurlstone; and the two travellers quickened their steps, and soon reached the. little gateway that opened into the cottage yard. Edward Hurl- stohe called out from the gate but no answer was received, and they entered the yard. The door was ajar, and they   DAYS OF J&MES I.       245 went through the house: it was deserted and empty. No- thing but the bare walls were left.  "Alas, what can have befallen these unfortunates?" said Father Maurus. "The fate of the faithful," replied his companion sadly. "Then let us pray for them. Prayer alone must now re- fresh us," said the priest. "I am not unprovided," replied Hurlstone, "I still have in my wallet some of the provisions which good Mrs. Wells pressed on me. She knew well we might soon need them." They knelt down then, beside: the cold and forsaken hearth, and making the sign of the cross commenced a silent prayer. Cautiously and silently a door leading to the cellar now opened a little; a pale, wan, but youthful face appeared from behind it. The boy, at length, glided quietly out and knelt beside them.           I "My poor lad," said the priest, rising as soon as he per- ceived him, and placing his hand kindly upon his head, "what has befallen this house?" "They have taken them all to the prison!" said the boy weeping. "Why have they taken them?"  "Because they would not go to the parish church. The parson said they had not been going, but that now all must go and conform or pay the fine. And father could not pay the fine, so they sold all the furniture in the house: and threatened him, if he did not go to church the next Sunday, they would fine and imprison him. We did not go the next Sunday, for father and mother said it was better to go to prison and die there Catholics, than to become Protestants for all the money which the parson or the magistrate had, and be punished in the next world forever. Then- the con- stables came and seized on father and mother and brother, 21*3 s ,.$   246       WILLITOFT, OR THE      ;  and took them away to jail, for where could father get mo- ney enough to pay the fines t I hid myself and have kept in the cellar ever since." "Where did they take your father and mother?" "I heard them say they must go to the jail at Needham." "It is not very far from here," said Edward Hurlstone. "You are right; I must visit them," replied' the priest. "But this poor boy? You are hungry-are you not?" "I have had some bread and some food which were left in the cellar: this has lasted me till this morning and I was praying to the ,holy Virgin for assistance, for I did not know what to do when that was gone." "You shall share our meal," said Edward Hurlstone, as he drew- out the provisions from his wallet and spread them on the floor. "Your prayers have been heard. It is pro- vidential that we have come, for I know where you can find a home, till your parents may be free once more."' "Follow the noble example of your pious parents, my child," said Father Maurus, "be faithful to God, and he will not desert you. If he do not relieve you from the per- secutions and trials of this world, he will give you, if you persevere to the end, a glorious place among his saints in beaven. Be firm and faithful, my son, and God bless you," said the priest, making the sign of the cross over the brow of the young sufferer for the faith. "There is a good and charitable Catholic residing not far from Needham, who will, I doubt not, take charge of this youth,!" said Edward Hurlstone.  .  ; We: will see him, then," replied the priest:, and after a frugal meal; upon. the cold provisions, Father Maturus and his rcompanions. turned, their steps towards Needham. Ed- ward Hurlstone-was right. . The Catholic farmer, whose * 20 a month for a man over 16. 10 for a married woman.   DAYS OF JAMES I.       247 house they reached before sun-down, gladly received his reverend visitor, and his two followers, and cheerfully con. sented to take the youth into his household. It now re- mained for Father Maurus, before resuming his journey toward Oxford, to visit if possible the poor souls who were confined for their faith in the neighboring jail of Needham. Edward Hurlstone promised to secure the means: and they both set out for the town as the shades of evening began to fall. The jail of Needham was a building not erected for the purpose of a prison but sufficiently adapted to it, without possessing those ample guards and defences which were common to the castles and donjons of other times, which, now that their military use had seemingly passed away, were applied to less chivalrous objects. It was a large square building, large for the town, with grated windows and surrounded by a high wall. "It will be difficult," said Father Maurus, " in one night to ascertain where they are confined." "( There is a Catholic in the town, who beyond all doubt can give me some advice as to that," said Edward Hurl- stone: -"I learned this from our entertainer. I will go to his house. In the mean while, you will await me in the neighborhood." In a short time Hurlstone returned with the desired in- formation. The persons charged with recusancy, of whom there were a number, were confined in a portion of the prison where the outer wall approached to within ten feet of the building. "We must wait until it is later," said Hurlstone, " when we will be joined by this person, who will bring what we need for our purpose." The time wore slowly on. At length silence reigned   248      ; WtmLTTOPT, OR TRI throughout the town and over the prison where sad and innocent hearts were mourning almost undistinguished from the guilty,-save as patient sorrow is divided from reckless hardihood. They were now joined by their expected assist- ant who brought upon his shoulders a ladder some twelve feet long, which was of sufficient heighth to enable a man to reach the top of the wall. After carefully reconnoiter- ing the premises to discover if the keepers were at repose - in the jail, for there were none upon the walls, the ladder was placed and Edward Hurlstone first ascended to the top. Grasping the little battlement at the summit with his muscular hands, he drew himself up by a powerful exer- tion and soon Stood panting on the wall. Father Maurus next ascended the ladder and Edward Hurlstone planting his knee firmly against the battlement drew him up to the summit. Their assistant below now raised the ladder, and, Hurlstone, grasping it froin above, brought it to the top of the wall. Then bracing one end against the projection of the battlement, he dropped the other gently against the wall of the building immediately under the window of the room in which the recusants were confined. Lightly spring- ing upon it, he traversed the rounds until he reached the window. He looked through the grated bars. A dim light, furnished by the unwonted kindness of one of the keepers, was burning in one corner, by which knelt a prisoner- pray- ing in a low voice beside a form stretched out in severe ill- ness upon a miserable bed of rags and straw. The sunken eyes, the hollow cheeks and thin lips of the sufferer told the tale of approaching dissolution: and Edward Hurlstone said, as he looked:- "Happy coming; -it is in time for good." Then he glanced round the miserable cell. Several were sleeping as if overcome by fatigue and watching; others   DAYS OF JAMES I.       249 were kneeling in fervent but silent prayer. The windows were unglazed--and he whispered cautiously, "Hope! brothers!" The whisper penetrated in the cell, and the silent kneel- ers turned their heads towards the window. Then one of them quietly arose, approached it, and said; "Who art thou?" "A friend! be of good cheer. Let your brother pray on. Be silent the rest. There is one here who will bring you comfort!" "Thanks to God! Thanks to God! In our need he has sent us aid! - Oh, how we prayed for it, but almost despaired of it," replied the man.  "God is powerful and merciful," said Edward Hurlstone reverently. "Is the sick man in immediate danger?" "He will not live over to-morrow!" "Bring him tenderly to this window: and prepare him for what he will receive: awaken the sleepers:-you may all confess and be absolved." -The sleepers were awakened: four. stout men silently raised the sick man and bore him to the window. Edwaird Hurlstone returned to the side of Father Maurus, explained to him what he had done and cautioned him to step care- fully upon the frail causeway. Father Maurus reached the window, passed his hand through the bars, and, making the sign of the cross, said: "The blessing of God be upon you, faithful Christians!" Then the head of the dying man was placed closer to him, he heard his confession, pronounced the absolution, admin- istered the viaticum, and anointed him with the holy oil of Extreme Unction. At length his office with the dying man was finished, the sufferer was borne back to his place say- ing, "Now, come? O Lord, for I am happy to die i" and   20       WtILLITOFT, OR THE the priest turned to the living. One by one, 4he prisoners confessed and were absolved; and with a parting blessing and a short exhortation to faith and perseverance,- the mis- sionary turned away and rejoined Edward Hurlstone upon the wall. The ladder was again lowered against the wall, Father Maurus descended and was followed by the faithful Edward Hurlstone. Their assistant in this charitable deed of Christian daring pressed them to tarry in his house till morning, but they returned in the dark to the dwelling of their previous entertainer where he promised to visit them in the morning to hear mass. Early on the following morning, a few faithful Catholics were assembled in an upper room of this house. One was posted at each window that commanded a view of the ap- proaches to the dwelling, and, in the dim light of dawn, the priest began his mass. His little congregation fearless of penal laws, for death was the penalty for them if disco- vered, joined devoutly in the service and the sacrifice.. The communion was over, the Mass was done, and gradually they dispersed to their homes unobserved, grateful to God for the rare opportunity of taking part in the holiest and most solemn rites of their faith. Father Maurus and his companion once more resumed their weary way towards Oxford. But why recite the labors, the travails, the wanderings of the priest in the performance of his vocation. Why follow him in midnight visits to the sick and the infirm, in toilsome marches over waste and desert commons to hunt up some lone and secluded Catholic house, to administer the conso- -lations of religion, to baptize the children,. to marry the betrothed, and to assoilzee the dying.- Why penetrate with him under the garb of a jailor or a physician or a servant, into the very dungeons of the prison house to carry hope   DAYS OF JAMES I.       251 and comfort and renewed faith into the breasts of his suf- fering flock. Why picture him standing upon a green and beautiful slope of a far-off hill, overhanging some prison walls, into which he could not enter, and as the proscribed gathered at the openings of their grated windows, speediny his distant blessings upon their heads: or now, finding re- fuge in some grand old baronial castle, or some stout ma- norial house, whose gentle owners still held to the ancient faith of their fathers in spite of proscription, or now con- cealing himself in the miserable huts of the poor but equally noble children of faith. Such was the mission in England in the beginning of the seventeenth century, such the daily life of the missionary: and two days of the mission labors of Father Maurus will suffice for all. The death scene in London-the secret school-the hidden Masses, the long foot-march, the desolate Catholic house, and the midnight visit to the prison overflowing with Catholics incarcerated for their adherence to their faith, are but rude sketches of points in a great historical picture stretching over genera- tions of the history of enlightened England-results of a spirit then dominant, afterwards beaten down, but once again seeking to rise triumphant on the surface and to rule through penal laws and persecution. *      An   CHAPT ER     XIV. -t Then, Judah, thou no more shalt mourn Beneath the heathen's chain I Thy days of splendor shall return, And all be new again.

N    the outskirts of Oxford, a large and gloomy j building of stone reared up its battlemented walls, broken by narrow, barred and grated windows, and surrounded by a high wall guarded on the summit by iron spikes. This building was the jail. In its vicinity, the houses were small and miserably squalid in their appear- ance. Poverty and crime seemed to fester there, as if the blight of the dungeon had infected its purlieus, as if the breath of crime had polluted and corrupted the atmosphere. Yet withini those gloomy walls were immured holy men- and women, whose only offence was their fidelity to the faith of their fathers, their adherence to the Catholic Church. Martyrs for their religion, they bore their sufferings with resignation and conquered their enemies with patience. Their number was such that they were crowded together in the small cells where the air had become foul and con- taminated, and where the filth had accumulated so that health was impaired and serious disease- generated. Over the gate in the second story of the tower, were con- fined in one small room, Mr. Travers, Mr. Scott, George Scott, and several of their tenants; In an adjoining one, were Mrs. Scott, Julia Travers, her aunt and other females   WILLtTOPT, OtR THE DAYS OF JAMES 1.  253 most of whom were incarcerated for the exercise of their religion. Beds of rough straw were cast upon the floor, thick with dirt and filth. There was no fire in the cell, and Mrs. Scott, Julia and her aunt were grouped together in one corner seeking to obtain some degree of comfort from the natural heat of their bodies and by heaping up the loose straw around them. Some of the other females, more inured to fatigue and privation, seemied to suffer less pain than these tender and gentle-nurtured ladies, whose lives had been passed hitherto in the midst of comfort and ele- gant refinement. Julia Travers was weeping. "My child," said Mrs. Scott, " be comforted! Surely, surely, our imprisonment cannot be of long duration. The laws of our country will protect the innocent." "Oh! Madam, the laws of England are but a poor pro- tection to the persecuted Catholic." "Nay, my child, make not unjust distinctions. I am suf- fering with you, and yet I am no Catholic." --- "Alas! But you have been kind to us, you have com- forted and protected us, and therefore you suffer. Ah! it is that thought which makes these prison walls more bitter to us. You and yours are suffering through us. May God bless you and reward you for your kindness!" "Julia," said her aunt, " let us have recourse to prayer." At this moment the door of the crowded cell was opened and the jailor thrust in two women, ragged and filthy- their features swollen with passion, and disfigured with the traces of debauchery-their lips teeming with horrid oaths and blasphemies, and their limbs reeling with intoxication. Julia pressed her hands upon her face to close out this hor- rid spectacle, and replied, as the door closed again: "Yes! yes! let us pray." "Pray I ha I ha! ha l" shouted one of these abandoned 22    -254      WILLITOPT, OR THE creatures. "Who talks of praying here? And who will listen to your prayers? 'Zounds! Molly, a pretty wench and so demure. I' faith, ha! ha! praying!" and she ap- proached insolently towards the party and looked in their faces.   - "Come, Bet! let the ladies alone," said her companion laughing boisterously. "You frighten pretty miss!" "Ladies! Why, what sort of ladies can be in jail?" And the two bad and reckless women broke out into a strain of impure blasphemies. The ladies shuddered and clasped their hands in horror: whilst the aunt exclaimed courageously: ' Oh monsters! cease to disgrace the sex with your dreadful impiety, cease to shock the-pure around you with your vile obscenity!" A loud laugh broke from the two abandoned ones, and the lady continued: 'jLet us betake ourselves to prayer, let us shut out their imprecations from our ears by the voice of supplication!" Down knelt those Christian women, and sooh the Pater and the Jdve arose in mrany voices, musically: yet horror! mingling with them, oaths and imprecations, oaths and im- precations from woman's lips. Which shall conquer? "Hail! full of grace!" said the kneeling suppliants. "Fiends blast ye!" shouted the reeling bacchanal, while her companion laughed aloud. Yet louder swells that beauteous prayer, and louder its foul accompaniment; and which shall conquer? Can you doubt?' Who can resist the touching memories of that prayer-its sweet promises, its visions of mercy, its remem- brance of the hour of terror-that prayer of woman, dear- est of all prayers to her, the record of her triumph, the pledge of her redemption from: the curse which through   'DAYS OF JAMES I.       255 her came upon the world. What thoughts stole into the heart of that wretched woman, as at each repetition of that tender invocation, her laugh became less wild'and at last sank down into a low whisper and. her step faltered. 9"Ha! Yes-' Mother of God! Blessed among women!' And I? cursed! cursed! cursed! I was not always so!- 'At the hour of our death!' Ah," and she shuddered, " who will pray for me at the hour of my death? How shall I die? What my fate? Alas!"And her reeling dance ceased, and she stood, sobered, gazing round upon that kneeling group whose voices still melodious rose together. She shuddered, ," Death! death!" and looked towards her companion. The face of this woman was hidden in her hands--first return of womanly modesty for years; then her knees seemed to yield, and she threw herself upon the straw and wept. The hearts of these two lost women were softened, and shame and sorrow and repentance came to- gether! In the next cell, loaded with chains, suffering from cold, pale and emaciated, worn down with sorrow, Mr. Travers, George Scott and his father sat gloomily conversing toge- 'ther. Winter was about breaking, and the time of trial was approaching. Sadly they looked forwards to it. Their friends had been denied admittance to them, and they knew not what schemes their enemies might be devising. They felt that their sole dependence was God and their own in- nocence: and though one was powerful and the other all powerful, they knew that innocence will not always secure justice where the evil and designing are distorting the law to their own selfish purposes, and that God doth not always choose to withdraw the cup from the lips of the suffering just in this world, for his richest rewards are reserved for the next. l          ;   256       WILLITOFT, OR THE c, HoW desolate is our condition!" said George Scott, with a sigh. "It is only now that I can feel the full de- lights of freedom. But if we have suffered, what must be the fate of my mother and the ladies?" "Ah, George, it is sad indeed!" said Mr. Travers, "but surely they will be discharged. It is cruel to keep them in prison when there is no shadow of a charge against them." "True, Travers, but you forget that there is no shadow of a charge against us," said the elder Scott, "yet we are the victims of as foul a conspiracy as ever was invented." "I feel sure we are indebted to our neighbor, Sir Henry Marsden for this. He was always full of schemes and owes us no good will," said George. "By heaven once out of these cells and with my right hand free, I will wash out the wrong with tenfold vengeance!" "George! George! Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord," interposed Mr. Travers solemnly, "I will repay." "Well, Sir, -that is Christian doctrine, but it is hard to comply with it." "Alas, my friend, you have benefitted little by this long imprisonment, if you have not learned to subdue your spirit. Be assured that this trial is from heaven and sent to chasten not to harden our hearts," replied Mr. Travers. George was silent, but not satisfied; and Mr. Travers continued: "As for myself. I have little hope of escape, and but for my daughter, I should heed it not. I have long since learned to look upon this world as only a place of exile, and I shall not sigh over the messenger who tells me my sojourn is over.. I know that God will guard my dear child and raise up friends to protect and assist her." "Oh, Sir!" said George Scott, grasping his hand, "if heaven spare -me, I will be -too happy to devote ry life to her. I have long loved her..nay turn not away-and here,   DAYS OF JAMES I.       257 here-in this prison, let me ask a double blessing upon our affection. Here let me obtain a father's consent." "Alas! George speak not of it," said Mr. Travers mourn- fiully. "In prison, in chains, without hope-it would be mockery. And if free-I and mine have brought sorrow enough upon your family. \Wedded to a Catholic, you would have to face worse trials than this, even. I will not subject my daughter to the danger of marrying out of the Church."  "Is not my brother a Catholic?" exclaimed George Scott passionately. "What have I to fear with a Catholic wife, more than I have suffered with a Catholic brother? Have I not borne this suffering with faith to him, and will I not bear the future with faith to her and justice to her con- science? Throughout this suffering, my hope has been this true affection. My father speak for me!" "Travers, let it be so! Do not wring their young hearts, if this affection be mutual. We may escape, for we are innocent, and they will be happy. When we are gone, he will be her protector. Your love for your daughter bids you yield. If we all perish, then we will die no more sor- rowfully for this?" "'Take her, then, my child: she is yours, in life and in death. I know that she loves you! May you be happy! And now I feel--something tells me,-I shall not escape this trial and go hence-I feel that I can pass away with an easier heart." That night Mr. Travers was seized with fever brought on by exposure and suffering, and want of proper food. It raged violently and he began to sink under it in spite of the tender consolations of his friends. Day after day the sufferers were intruded upon by a min. ister, sent to convert them, who poured out his denuncia" -22*   258       WILLITOFT, OR THE tions against- their religion so vehemently that the Catholics stopped their ears and the two Protestant gentlemen became disgusted. Each time, as soon as their tormentor departed, some one of-the Catholics would recite the litany df Jesus, while the rest responded. By prayer and pious conversation they determined to resist the assaults of their enemies. , Several days after Mr. Travers was taken sick, George Scott observed the keeper, as he brought in their scanty provisions, fix his eyes meaningly upon him, and, for the first time, it struck him that the man's face was singularly altered or that another jailor attended them. Upon a fur- ther examination, it seemed to him that he recognized the features, but he was unable to recall the person. "What is your name?" he said abruptly. "Hope!" replied the jailor emphatically, but at the same time frowning slightly. "A pleasant name truly, for one of your occupation," said George Scott, bitterly. "Your visits may bring hope to your prisoners, but not the thing hoped for." "While I am here you have hope," he replied quietly. Mr. Travers attracted by the mild tone of the keeper, raised his head from the pallet of straw on which he lay tossing in pain. '"Ha! it is-" but he paused instantly, for the jailor pressed his finger upon his lips and left the room. "It is Edward Hurlstone!" he whispered to-George Scott. "Then we have hope indeed,! Bear up, hear up, Sir, we shall at least know what is our actual condition, and I am sure that this man, whose countenance was not unknown to me, would not, be here unless he indeed brought hope ;with him."  "You are right, I think!"  ' When'night had closed in, the door was opened softly and Hutlstone entered. Drawing George Scott and his fa-   DAYS OF JAMES t.       259 ther aside, lhe related to them the conversation which he had overheard at Scottsfield, and laid open to them, as far as he was acquainted with the particulars, the schemes which were in operation against them. "Alas," exclaimed Mr. Scott, when he had closed the recital, " alas! Hurlstone, you only bring us the confirma- tion of our ruin. Now that I see the plan of our enemies, I find it less possible to overcome them. They, who have taken such steps, will not hesitate at direct perjury. I fear we can have no hope." "When I learned these matters, I deemed it my duty to inform you in time. I have been able to obtain the place of one of the turnkeys who is sick. -I have brought you some refreshments for my old landlord, Mr. Travers. He has been kind to my friends and- family, and I shall not forsake him in misfortune." And he brought in a basket containing a bottle of wine, some white bread, and cordials. "Thanks, good Hurlstone," said George Scott. "But as there is little hope of defeating the villains, can you not secure our escape hence?" "I will try, Sir, but it will be difficult as there are guards below and all around the walls: yet I have been in worse situations. But the sick man and the ladies?" :' True, we cannot desert him; we will carry him with us, or remain and die with him. The ladies will be safe even should we escape." "George, George! hither my boy " said Mr. Travers, and he continued as the young man stood beside his pallet, "George, tell HurlstoneiI charge him by all his gratitude to me and his hope of mercy hereafter to bring me a priest here. I have heard wondrous tales how these brave-apos- tles have penetrated into the deepest dungeons. I feel that   2e60      '  WILLITOFT, OR THE death, is not far off, and oh! I must obtain the sweet con- solations of religion." "There is a priest here, alas!" said Hurlstone, with much feeling, and'approaching the bed-side, "He has not been long, in the country. He is untiring in his labors. All the winter he has been toiling on the mission, travelling on foot, going from house to house of the proscribed, baptizing their children-, administering the sacraments and strength- ening their faith. He has penetrated the strongest dun- geons in disguise, to bring to the suffering martyr the last rites of the Church. He has assoyled the condemned on the path to the scaffold: and alas! he is now rejoicing in the prospect of martyrdom. He was arrested here in Ox- ford in the ministrations of his office, by Topliffe, and is at present confined in this prison. I know every turn and corner of this place," and he sighed deeply. "I learned it in other days. I will find him out and bring him to you." "Heaven bless you, Hurlstone!" "'Yes, pray for me, all of yop; I need it. All that I can do will never wash out the evil I have done." And he left  the room upon his mission. In less than- an hour, the expectant party heard footsteps treading lightly in the passage, and the door opened, a man entered, and it was cautiously closed behind him. In the darkness it was impossible to distinguish his features, but from his movements and the activity of his step he was evi- dently in the first prime of life. Through the grated win. low an: indistinct light penetrated the room from the starlit heavens,;'which, enabled the eye to distinguish faintly the outlines of forms. George Scott approached him and hold- ing4 out his, hand said in a low tone: - ,a itheristt  I -w a        ' r sp C Yes, my son, it is I," was the response.  Y,                 =n sn,ti"a   DAYS OF JAMES. Z.       261 "This way, Sir," said Scott taking his hand, and leading him-to the spot where Mr. Travers rested. "Here, Sir, is the gentleman who needs your aid. Two of us are not Catholics, but you may rely upon our honor." "And oh! so cold! George! George! was it thus we parted?" "That voice!-those words! Great God! who are you? Speak! speak!" and the hand of the young man trembled in the firm compressed grasp of the priest. Throwing open the loose large coat he wore, the stranger  tookffrom its place of concealment a small dark lantern: first he threw its light upon the features of George Scott, then let it rest upon his own. "Yes it is he! my brother, my long lost brother!" and the young man threw himself into his arms. "Oh, Wil- liam, is it thus we meet?" *' Would that thou wert even as I am," he said as he clasped him warmly to his bosom. "My son! my son! thou in this guise!-but in any guise, my son, welcome to my heart!" 'exclaimed the father. And thus they met, father, son, and brother, after four years of absence, four years of separation, four years of silence; thus, in the walls of a prison, with suffering and death be- fore them. Was it sad for all? How different the feelings of that father and son and brother, and yet how like in their utter want of selfishness! Each felt for the others but with strangely opposed regrets. Not in chains, in prison, nor in death, did the devoted priest see the darkness which oppressed him: but it was another chain which he hoped to break, another prison from which he desired to drag them, another death from which he :yearned-to save them. They thought only of the suffeing which certainly awaited him: he gloried in that prospect; for to him the world c,              ;   262       WILLITOFYT, OR- THE of his brightest hopes rested beyond the tomb. Little he heeded how dark and sorrowful might be the passage through its portals. Sadly, for a moment, were they silent, as these thoughts passed through their minds, standing hand in hand in fond greeting and dwelling in thought up- on the fortunes of each other. "My time is short! father, brother! Let me minister to him who needs my aid!" said Father Maurus. "And this, brother, is the spouse that you have wedded and brought home to us! Alas! it is a bond of sorrow, a contract of suffering!"  "Yes, my brother, but it will be full of fair fruits, and thou shalt be-the proof, with the grace of God!" "I?" "Yes! Do I not pray for the lost sheep of my own household? To whom, first, should I bring my message of love? Have I not dreamed of it in the long hours of study and toil? Have I not pictured it in the watches of the night? Has not the aspiration mingled with the swell- ing matin song and the vesper hymn, and, in these chains and prison walls, do I not see the first dawnings of my hopes?"After a pause he continued: "And our mother and Julia?" "They are here, in this prison," said George Scott sadly, "but we have not seen them. The first hour -of imprison- ment was the last hour of parting." "I will see them, and bring you tidings of them," said the priest, and turned to the bed-side of Mr. Travers. What surprise--what astonishment, what joy to that sick man, as he gazed from his lowly couch of straw upon the scene which had just passed before him. A priest of God --and that priest William Scott! He gazed upon him, turned the light ofethe little lantern upon his features, and   DAYS OF JAMES I.       263 then pressed him in his arms. Tears rolled down the eyes of the father and brother, as they looked upon the bound- less joy of that suffering man. They saw his lips move, but the least spoken word came not to their ears. Then followed his confession, the whispered consolation, the so- lemn absolution and the final benediction: "Go in peace and sin no mpre!" How striking, how affecting, how beautiful! Worthy of the religion made by the finger of God. "Oh, now, let me depart in peace!" exclaimed Mr. Tra- vers oyfully. "Where is it that the mercy of God cannot come " "My brother, I rejoice, at least, in my sorrow, that thou canst bring consolation with thee," said George Scott. "Would I could bring it to thee, brother!" replied the priest sadly. "Alas! how can I believe?" "I will instruct thee!" "Nay, but it is darkness, I have been taught to believe, and not light, that which thou hast embraced. England so believes, and there are men in, England more learned than I; why see they it not?" "Behold this dark lanthorn! Now it is closed, not a ray from within penetrates to the deep gloom around it. Cast open that little gate and a flood beams down upon thee, and thou seest, when before thou wast as one blind. Did the light cease to exist because thou didst not see it? George, George, the Holy Catholic Church, in this England of ours, is like unto this little lamp. - Plates of brass and iron surround it; bolts and bars compass it about; its light, pure, bright, serene and holy, shines only within prison walls: but each- struggling ray beams. out the more bril- liantly from the darkness that envelopes it. ,          \    4,   264       WILtITOXT? 0l THt "Oh my Divine Master I when shall that glorious hour come, when free and unchained the light of thy Church shall blaze forth in England in its pristine glory! Yes, it shall comel It: shall come! The blood of thy martyrs, oh England, oh my country I is poured out upon thy soil by tyrants, but it shall sanctify thee! The voice of their agony is ringing out, but- it -arises to God mingled with prayers for thy conversion and regeneration I Thy prisons are choked with holy confessors and virgins, and thy dun- geons are filled with strong men pining away because they will not forsake thy ancient faith. But every pang, every sigh, every hour of chains and suffering, goes up to heaven to- intercede for thee I From thy fields, watered with blood and tears, must spring up legions of men armed with prayer, and the mercy of God will not resist their supplications. Once a bright garden of the faith, thou canst not remain for ever choked up with weeds!" The voice of the priest sank from its tone of high enthu- siasm, his uplifted hands fell once more to his side, the glow of holy zeal passed from his countenance, and, in a subdued manner, he said: "Oh my brother, my father, pray with me that God may open your eyes and make the light of his truth shine upon you!" and he passed abruptly from the room. I  Edward Hurlstone still waited without, the locks were turned and they moved on. "Hurlstone lead me to the cell where my mother is confined." His companion paused before the next door, drew forth a heavy key from his girdle, and opened it. Shall we follow? Alas I we shrink from the attempt to describe the joy and sorrow of the mother, the absorbing zeal of the missionary, mingling with and overpowering his filial affection :--the mother gladdening over her long /'   DAYS OF JAMES I.       265 lost son, the priest before her whom he loved with the ut- most of his human love, and yet for whom that love was as nothing, compared with the burning zeal for her salvation which fired h'is heart. "In pain and sorrow she has brought me into the world, to her I owe my life; what shall I not do to bring her into the fold of my master!" he said as he passed within. Time passed he came forth, he sighed, ". Ah I will win 'you yet! not I, but the grace of God! I will pray him night and day! Ye cannot resist, oh! my father, my mother, my brother!" and he moved on silently towards his cell. They entered together. "Well, Edward, you have followed me to my prison," said the priest to his companion. "When I left you in Oxford, I returned to London to ferret out matters in relation to these sad affairs. On my return I heard that Topliffe had arrested you, and that you were incarcerated in that very prison into which we had so often in vain endeavored to penetrate, whilst we had suc- ceeded in entering others even more difficult of access. My conversion was not known here as it would have been at the jail where your friends were at first confined. I learned that a keeper was sick; I applied for his place. I was, alas! only known to them as one of the agents of Rodewell, and I was received, as I have already told you, temporarily. When the keeper recovers I shall be compel- ed to depart." "It is providential," said Father Maurus, and the keeper left him to his repose. Night after night, the priest entered those cells. Night after night he came, forth with brighter hopes. Suddenly the visits -of Edward Hurlstone ceased, and the priest and his penitents met no more! 23   CHAPTER XV. "Cruel and cunning, scheming still."-ANON. ELL, Sir Henry," said Rodewell, as they sat ' ^  together at Housewell, at the breaking up of winter, "every thing is progressing well on my part." "Yes, I have heard that there was some disturbance at Underwood, a few nights ago," remarked Sir Henry with a smile. "True! A most unfortunate affair! These papists, you know, these dreadful papist tenants!--we ought to have arrested the whole of them with their master!"And Rode- well shook his sides with laughter. "Well, let me hear the particulars," said the knight. "It seems that a good merchant from London, who has laid aside a plum by economy and attention to business, which means short measure and double prices, heard of the unhappy condition of the two families over here, and the probability of a sale of their estates for the crown, and came posting down to examine the property; for you must know that the merchant was ambitious to become a landlord, and wished to step into their shoes. Cruel dog! to desire to profit by the mishaps of others!" and the pursuivant grin- ed maliciously. "Our merchant was delighted with the properties, and expressed himself determined to secure one at least at all hazards and at any price. My friend, John Foxly, advised him kindly, to beware how he express- ed such an intention, as the character of the people was I   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I.  267 exceedingly bad, and their adherence to their late landlords very strong. But the merchant laughed at the idea. That night, a party of the tenantry, disguised of course, not our servants certainly you know," and Rodewell again laughed, "seized on the poor merchant, who was already dreaming of becoming a landlord and being in the commission and all that, mounted him on a sharp rail and rode him to the verge of Scottsfield, declaring that they would give him a seisin of the land at once. "'For God's sake, good people, let me go,' cried the terrified man, his round fat face pale with terror and his teeth chattering together. "' Let you go, quick enough, when the other end of this rope is passed over the limb of that old oak,' said the lead- er of the gang in a voice marvellously like John Foxly's, as he tied one end in a real hangman's noose and slipped it tightly about the neck of the victim. "'Oh my God, you will not hang me?' "' Who told you so, old fellow?' and the ruffians laughed heartily at- the joke. "'We are about to teach you to buy our master's land, old tape seller!' cried one: "'Yes, we will revenge our wrongs upon the persecu- tors,' said another: "' Swing him up! swing hip up!' shouted all. "The fat dealer begged and prayed and swore. He re- nounced all intention of buying, nay, he declared that he would not take the estate as a gift; not even if forty thou- sand pounds were paid him for accepting it. But the ruf- fians would not relent until they had swung him off the rail, at the same time letting the cord go, so that he fell to the ground instead of dancing in the air. Then they tied him to the tree, gave him a sound lashing, dragged him   268   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I. through a pond, and, at last, set him down half dead with cold, pain, and fright, at Giles Horstead's door. "As soon as he was able to travel on the next day, he departed, swearing horribly about the savage condition of this portion of the kingdom." Sir Henry laughed heartily, and said: "Our fat merchant will not bid against us certainly." "Nor any one else, but those I permit," added Rodewell. "But how stand our prospects with you?" "I have heard from a friend in the city," replied the knight, " that the lands will be exposed for sale as soon as the convictions and confiscations are obtained." "Oh, then the matter is safe. Our merchant will circu-- late such stories, that no one will desire to overbid us. And if he do not, I will have it done for him. The town and the country will ring with the bloody papistical out- break, riot, and outrage committed by the adherents ofg those arch traitors, Scott and Travers!" "Really, that will do for two purposes. It will give im- portance to the approaching trials, and aid us in our ulte- rior purposes. But I was not prepared to give John Foxly so much credit for coolness and courage in the execution of orders, as he displayed in the merchant's affair. I know you to be capable of designing any thing," said the baronet. "Oh Foxly is a rare hand," replied Rodewell. "I do believe he enjoyed the thrashing he imposed upon the fat cit, right heartily. The conviction is safe enough without this to aid it," continued the pursuivant, as he rose to take his leave, "but I doubt not it will prepare a feeling which will insure it beyond doubt." "And I have the money ready for the sale," said the knight as they parted.   CHAPTER XVI. TRIALS AND TRITUMPHS. Are ye not near when sorrow unrepiming, Yields up life's treasures unto him/who gave? When martyrs, all things for his sake resigning, Lead on the march of death, serenely brave?-ANGEL VISfTS. @ NE morning, Father Maurus was ranging about the prison bounds, during the hour which the keeper, won by his amiable and uncomplaining demeanor, occasionally permitted him to spend in this manner, when a party of prisoners descended from the cells and prepared to set forth under a guard. They were his father, his brother and Mr. Travers, supported or rather borne by several of his tenants. Shortly after the ladies were brought down and placed in carriages. Father Mau- rus knew that they were going to the place of trial, and, although he shuddered for a moment when he thought of the indignity which those tenderly nurtured females would suffer at the bar, he turned from the idea as of a mere worldly trial, momentary, quickly passing, purifying in its suffering and to be received with gratitude and resignation. Passing near them, he waved his adieus to them, and say- ing aloud, "the blessings of heaven protect you;" he haste- ned to his little cell and betook himself to prayer. An hour passed, and then the footsteps of a guard were heard along the corridor; they paused before his door, the bolt was shot back, the jailor entered and bade him follow. They passed on until they reached the office of the govern- or of the prison. There, they found two stout, bluff-look- 23*   270       WILLITOFT, OR THE ing men in conversation with the governor, one of whom held certain papers in his hand; as Father Maurus entered, the official said, "Gentlemen, I hold' the prisoner, Mr. Maurus, subject to your order: I have drawn the receipt for him, and as soon as you shall acquit me of him, and deliver me duly authenticated authority, I shall deliver him into your hands." "Here, master Governor," said the principal officer, " is your order," and signing the acquittance, "here is your receipt. Now Sir, will it please you, master prisoner to follow us, after we have put the ruffles on." Handcuffed and chained, Father Maurus was led forth and placed in a carriage. The officer seated himself at the- side of the driver of the vehicle, the other entered the car- riage, and as he closed the door said, " and- now to Lon- don-," and the carriage drove rapidly away. In the crowded court room, ranged together facing the judge's bench, with a thousand eyes looking frowningly upon them, sat the unfortunate prisoners. The beauty and sorrow of Julia Travers won a momentary sympathy, but the horror of the spectators for her religion soon hardened their hearts. Near the king's counsel sat the quondam pursuivant, master Rodewell; his eye moved quickly but nervously around, with a restless activity indicative of the dark fire within. A cloud seemed to rest upon his brow, which in spite of all his efforts continued to darken. Ever and anon, he leaned forward and whispered in the ear of the crown's counsel who occasionally noted down his re- marks. At length, a jury was impannelled, the indictment was read, the prisoners arraigned for treason and the counsel for the crown opened his case. He detailed the alleged conspiracy of four years ago: its detection-the manner   DAYS OF JAZMES I.       271 in which the guilty parties escaped-their continued prose- cution of their original treason. He recounted the various links of testimony which connected the two families toge- ther, their intercourse, their seclusion from the other gentry of their neighborhood, and at last brought forth the papers which contained the particulars of their conspiracy. These were signed by Mr. Travers, Mr. Scott, and George Scott, and several of their tenantry, and contained a solemn pledge on the part of the signers that the one whose name should be drawn by lot would kill the king, for the purpose of placing a Catholic -on the throne. The papers indicated that this was only'a part of a widely extended conspiracy-- but the other ramifications had not yet been discovered. Several letters were produced purporting to have been writ- ten by William Scott, then abroad, and having treasonable associations in foreign lands, and believed to have taken orders from a foreign ecclesiastical authority. Astonishment seized upon the accused. They looked at each other, for a moment, in silence: then George Scott sprang up and exclaimed in bitter indignation, "It is false-false as ---" "Cease, George, cease!" interrupted Mr. Travers, " we are innocent; let us trust in God!" "Be silent, Sir," said the presiding judge angrily: and the counsel for the crown began to introduce his testim6ny. He proved the finding of the arms by Jedediah. The groom was then introduced and adhered to his story as given in his affidavit, though it required sundry nods from Rodewell to bring him td the point. The book in defence of the Supremacy of the Pope was produced, and lastly the papers found in the house were identified by John Foxly, who swore to their discovery. Several respectable gentlemen testified, with evident reluctance, that the signatures to   272       WILLITOFT, OR THE these papers were in their opinion genuine. The papers were read to the jury. "What," exclaimed George Scott, "we, who are Pro- testants, plot such treason!" "Yes, Sir. We shall prove thai you are all Jesuits in: disguise:" and the prosecutor proceeded to read several letters purporting to arrange the details of the conspiracy and its general extension. These letters were signed by William Scott, and seemed by their allusions to be written to Catholics. In vain did the prisoners cross examine the witnesses for the crown. Only once or twice did the groom falter, while Jedediah reiterated his story and minutely de- scribed the beggar who had led him to the spot where the arms were concealed. So far the case seemed perfectly clear, and the cloud on the brow of Rodewell began to disappear and be succeeded by a glow of triumph. The prosecution had closed its case; and Mr. Scott, for no counsel was then allowed to prison- ers, arose to open his defence.          At "My lords, and gentlemen of the jury," he said. "In the name of my companions, in my own, I solemnly pro- test that we are innocent of the charges brought against us. That there has been no conspiracy on our part, we do de- clare. here, and in the presence of our God. But we are the victims of a conspiracy as foul as ever came from the brain of man or the suggestions of the fiend. We are sur- rounded by fraud, by perjury, and by forgery. We are drawn in as with a net, and without counsel, with but an accidental warning of the charges against us, without the means of obtaining witnesses, we are unable to counteract the efforts of our enemies. We place our trust'in God. We know the workings of this plot: but he who could have revealed them is not here to-day"   DAYS OF JAMES I.       273 A grim smile passed over the countenance of the pur- suivant. "That dark scheming man," continued Mr. Scott, point- ing to Rodewell, "is the cause of our ruin: he has ensnared us for base lucre!"Rodewell became pale, as the finger of Scott pointed him out. "God, in his own hour, will stretch forth his hand to chastise him. It is true thatiarms were found upon our estates and papers were discovered at our houses. There is the man who secreted them-for, as God is my judge, I knew not of these things until these men had brought forth their pretended discoveries." Again, Rodewell smiled in derision; but his countenance. changed as some one in the crowd handed a note to Mr. Scott. While he read it, his countenance brightened, and, with a voice tremulous with emotion, he continued, "And now, my lords and gentlemen of the jury, I will proceed to prove what I have stated,--thanks to the good- ness of God! Crier, call Edward Hurlstone to the witness stand!" Rodewell started, but resumed his position in a moment, muttering "Ha! I thought the villain in the Plantations, but I will crush him. Scottsfield shall be mine, mine!" Edward Hurlstone mounted the stand with a firm step, though he might well fear that it would lead him to the scaffold. All eyes were fixed upon him. The fact that the Scotts were Protestants had excited some interest in their behalf. No evidence had been produced to criminate any of the ladies, and the public compassion was touched when it was recollected that they had endured a long and painful imprisonment. Herein the schemers had outwitted them- selves: they hoped by their incarceration to cut off the most active friends of the accused and crush them easily by   274       WILLITOFT, OR THE preventing preparations for the defence. They succeeded in part, but it reacted against them. Hurlstone began' his evidence: he stated that he had been one of the companions of Rodewell, that he knew him and had watched his movements after the finding of the arms: that, at length, after the arrest of the accused, by means of a secret passage into the room at Scottsfield, he had overheard the conversation of Rodewell with Foxly about the arms they had secreted and the treasonable papers which had been prepared for them by a friend in London. e,   "It is false!" exclaimed Rodewell, turning pale. "Thou art a traitor thyself, and a pervert papist, and art unworthy of belief!" "Nay, master Rodewell! not so fast! What I have said is the truth, and thou knowest and showest it. My lord, as I have said before, I was once of this m4n's' party, and I shrewdly suspected who this friend was. I went to Lon- don and I found him. He is here. His name is master John Edmonds!" "Ha! thou liest!" exclaimed Rodewell starting to his. feet, "He is not here-!" "I am, I am!" exclaimed a voice in the crowd, and a man pressed his way to the witness box, holding in his hands a roll of papers. The excitement had become in- tense. The silence of Travers had made the court and jury forget that a Catholic was concerned, and they listened eagerly to the unexpected developments so startling in their nature. As for the prisoners, fear, new found hope, surprise, agitation, almost overpowered them. "Yes, I am here to repay your fraud and deceit. My lord; this man came to me with these papers, which I now hold in my hand, some eight months since,--my profession is that of a writer,--and he gave me several specimens of   DAYS OF JAMES I.       275- writing in which certain letters and documents were to be copied. Here are the originals in his own hand-writing!" "Fool, fool that I was to trust him," muttered Rodewell, "I thought I had burned them." "I gave him back copies in imitation also of his own writing while I kept the originals, for I suspected him. Doubtless he has destroyed my copy, here are the originals." "Let me examine," said the judge. After a careful col- lation with the papers in evidence before the jury, he con- tinued, "They are word for word alike! When was this?" "It was in July last." "When were these papers found, you witness-Foxly," said the judge-but Foxly was gone. "I believe in August, my Lord," said the prosecutor. "If these papers are the same prepared by me," said Edmonds, "your lordship will find at the last word of each page a small scroll with the letters E. M." "It is so," said the judge, "here, and here, and here! Mr. Attorney, this is a foul affair!" "But, your lordship, there are the concealed arms!" "Yes," replied the judge musing. "But if this fellow Hurlstone, were not a papist, we might believe'him. Has he been proved a papist?" "It has been averred and he has not denied it." "My lord, I do not lie to you!" said Hurlstone firmly. "I owe a debt of justice to those innocent men, and I will repay it. I have toiled and struggled night and day to this end, and now I shall have my reward. If master Henries be called to the stand he will explain the affair of the arms." Until this moment Rodewell had maintained his dogged resolution: now he whispered once more to the crown's counsel, and then amid the bustle attendant upon the exa- mination of another witness, mingled with the crowd and o.       * 2m     WILLITOFT, OR THE forced his way out ghastly pale, his teeth set, his lips mut- tering horrid curses and blasphemies. Master Henries proved that he had furnished certain arms in large quantities to master Foxly just prior to the discovery made at Willitoft and Scottsfield-.that he had recently examined some of them, and found them to!e the same he had sold. "Enough; enough; my lord!" said the prosecutor. "We are done with this treason story!" "Gentlemen of the jury," said the judge, " the prosecu- tion is abandoned-your verdict will be ' not guilty.' " Oh sweetly-came those words upon the ears of the suf- ferers! Their innocence was proved, and that at the very moment when they had despaired of human aid, and turned towards haaven. Julia Travers threw herself into her father's arms: he, pale and flushed by turns, seemed almost unable to support the sudden transition from danger to safety. But- pause! "I must remark, my lord, that this is an extraordinary case," said the crown counsel. "The villain who has de- vised this conspiracy should be brought to justice. In addi- tion to this, I would say that this is a fit occasion for making an example of contumacious papists!" "Certainly, Sir, let a bench warrant be issued for the man Rodewell,- and let the oaths of abjuration and supre- macy be tendered at once to the acquitted!" What need of many words! They were refused by Mr. Travers, his daughter and relative, and by his Catholic fol- lowers, and sadly from the midst ofjoy, from their weeping friends, they were borne back to prison. "Scott, I felt it, I knew it. Farewell, George, George! Remember! my Son!" Sad was that parting!   DAYS OF JAMES I.       2" Edward Hurlstone had maintained his position; his arms were folded upon hirbreast, and his head bowed down. "And now for you, Sir," said the judge. "You are charged with being a papist pervert. Make a full confes- sion, recant, ahd you are safe!" "I am a Catholic," he replied, and obstinately refused to say more. "I will implicate no one," he thought. An indictment was prepared, sent before the grand jury, and returned a true bill. He was arraigned, but still he was silent. "Sirrah! do you know the punishment for contumacy in refusing to plead?" said the judge angrily. Hurlstone bowed his head but answered not. "Remove him and apply the ' Peine forte et dure?'" Reader! those words of horror, dost thou hear them? Dost thou feel them creeping through thy marrow, crushing thy bones, ahdbspurting out thy blood! Shudder! Edward Hurlstone was removed to the prison. Down on the floor was the silent man outstretched. Over his un- resisting body was placed a broad and heavy tablet. Upon this tablet, weight after weight was added, until the pres- sure and the torture became horrible. But that strong stern man was silent. jMore! more! Hours pass! Gracious God! can human nature endure so much and long? More weights yet! the ubones are cracking! the lungs are gasp- ing wildly! List! those last gasps come out in faint arti- culation! "Oh Christ--receive-my soul!" There is a palpitating mass out of which the spirit and life have gone. The muscles still start convulsively--the nerves still twitch--the veins seem almost to throb-while the head and face projecting beyond the tablet are black with congested blood. The executioners look on coolly- 24   278       WILLITOFT, OR THE those hardened men-as they pass out from the scene of horrid torture. The penitent died a martyr! In the dungeons of Newgate pined Father Maurus. The spring was opening brightly, but its balmy air could not penetrate the dark vaults, where daily, hourly, knelt and prayed the captive missionary. Yet, there was an at- mosphere around him, sweeter far and more enlivening than the fresh breezes that floated over the fair flower-bearing fields and the budding forests. But he was not destined to possess that calm solitude and that holy suffering long. Another scene was approaching. Those who attended him in his narrow cell sometimes talked to him of the world without, of the state of public feeling in which there seemed to be a sudden lull of the stern passion for blood; and, sometimes, a keeper, more kind-hearted than the rest, would seek to console him by saying that there was a strong probability that, at that time, the judges would not proceed to theexecuiton of any priest. How he wondered at that sigh, that upraising of the face to heaven and the silent motion of the lips? Greater had been his surprise, had that heart-prayer sounded on his ear. "Oh, blessed Saviour, grant that thy servant may be found worthy to suffer for thy sake!" Weeks had passed, and yet he had received no intima- tion of the fate of his friends. They, too, were ignorant of his condition, or to what prison he had been removed. At length, on ,the evening of the twenty-eighth of May, 1612, he was conducted to the Old Bailey, where were sit- ing the Lord Mayor, the Bishop of London, the Lord Chief Justice Cook, the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, the Recorder of London, with many other Justices.   DAYS OF JAMES I.       279 The indictment against him was read, and the clerk de- manded whether he pleaded "Guilty or Not Guilty?" "It containeth falsehood," said the priest calmly, "and therefore I say ' not guilty!" "Are you a priest or not?" said the Recorder, taking up his words. "Whether I am a priest or no, I am not called on to say. Let those who accuse me, make out that I am a priest." "Then you impliedly admit that you are a priest, and therefore you are guilty," said the Lord Chief Justice Cook. "And in cases of prwamunire, it hath been adjudged suffi- cient to find a man guilty that he neither admitted nor de- nied the charge." "My Lord, if that hold in cases of prwemunire," replied Father Mautus, recalling his old studies to mind; " it is certain that in cases of life and death, you are only to pro- ceed according to what has been made out legally by wit- nesses." "If you were no priest, you would not hesitate to avow it," said King, the Bishop of London. "It doth not become your Lordship, nor any one of your cloth, to mingle in cases of life and death," replied Father Maurus quickly. "Still thou dost not answer the question. Art thou a priest or no?" persisted the Bishop. "My Lord," replied Father Maurus.  "Art thou a priest?" "No!" replied the prelate indignantly. "No priest-no bishop!" said the priest sententiously. "I am a priest," said the Bishop, "but no massing priest." "If you are a priest, you are a sacrificing priest; for sa- crifice is essential to priesthood, and if you are a sacrificing   280       WILLITOFT, OR THE priest, then you are a massing priest. 'For what other sacrifice have the priests of the new law, as distinct from mere laicks, to offer to God, but that of the eucharist which we call the mass?' If then you are no massing priest you are no sacrificing priest, if no -sacrificing priest, no priest at all, consequently no bishop." "This is sorry trifling, Sir!" said the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. "It is plain enough to my mind that you are a priest." And certain circumstantial matters having been testified to, the court directed the jury. to find the prisoner guilty. "My Lords," said Father Maurus, "I am sorry to see' my cause confided into the hands of twelve ignorant men, who know not what manner of thing a priest is. For you, gentlemen of the jury," he said, "I grieve for you that my blood shall fall upon your heads! But that you may avoid the sin of putting to death an innocent man, let me bid you remember, that no evidence has been brought against me to prove me guilty of the matters whereof I stand indicted: that nothing but mere presumptions are laid before you; and that, by the law of England, I stand before you as an innocent man, until my accusers shall prove me guilty. For your own salvation, let me pray you, gentlemen, to weigh this solemn matter well."                 Nothing more said the'priest, and the jury withdrew. In a few moments they returned with their verdict. "Guilty!" "Thanks be to God!" exclaimed the holy priest, throw- ing himself upon his knees. After a moment he added: "Happy message! Joyous tidings! How have I sighed for the privilege of suffering for so glorious a cause!" Then arising and turning to the people he exclaimed:   DAYS OF JAMES I.       281 "When I was charged with being a priest, 1 was silent, for I would have the law take its due course, and I wished it to be seen whether they would condemn Jme upon bare presumptions, without any witness. It is done! Where- fore, now, to the glory of God and all the saints in heaven, I do confess that I am a Monk of the Order of St. Bennet, and a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. Herein do I -glory! But be ye all witnesses, I pray ye, that I have com- mitted no crime against his majesty or my country. I am only accused of priesthood, and for priesthood alone, am I condemned!" "Prisoner, have you any thing to say, wherefore, sen- tence of death should not pass upon you?"--asked the -Recorder impatiently. "What I have to say will not prevent that which you have already resolved upon," said Father Maurus mildly. "Yet, perhaps, I may not without sin give up my life with- out a struggle. I am condemned for receiving orders, and returning to England. Now it can be no crime to receive orders, for it is a sacrament of God's Church, bestowing grace upon him who receives it; and neither can I be con- demned rightfully, for returning into England, which is an act innocent in itself, and what, as a free born English- man, I had full title to do. Now, therefore, thou canst not of two innocent and praiseworthy acts make a crime. Nay! an' thou addest as many good and innocent acts together as thou wilt, thou canst not thereof compose a crime,!" "Tush! Sir! this is Jesuitical cant," said the Recorder, interrupting him. Father Maurus was silent; but the joy of his heart was displayed upon his beaming face. When the Recorder drew on his black'cap preparatory to passing sentence of -24*    282       WILLITOFT,. OR THE death, he smiled sweetly and sadly. How that mild beam- ing countenance stole upon the hedrts of' the crowd around! They melted-they sympathised; at length they applauded, carried away by the sublime disregard of death and suffer- ing, which the martyr displayed. But their applause only drew from the Judge a severe reprimand upon the forward bearing of the prisoner.      - Sentence was pronounced. "Hanged! drawn and quar- tered!" Bound hand and foot, heedless of chains, sorrow, death, the rejoicing priest was borne back to his dungeon, only to leave it again for the scaffold and the knife. On the morrow, marched out from Newgate one of those dark processions, then not unfrequent in England's capi- tal, with its victim bound to the hurdle. Slowly it crept along, until at length it reached the bloody hill of Tyburn. It passed along under the gallows and paused as the hurdle reached its foot. The victim was unbound, and with a firm step he mounted to the scaffold. In the open space in front, a large fire was burning, and all the horrid instru- ments of execution were ranged around. Down upon the scaffold floor knelt the doomed priest and prayed; then he arose with a glowing countenance, stepped forward, and addressed the multitude. "Good friends, I would have you that are here bear tes- timony to the manner of my death, that I have been a true and faithful liege unto my king and country, and that with " my dying breath I have prayed for his majesty and for his kingdom.  I am about to die the death of a .traitor-bear witness, ye, that my treason lyeth in this, that I have ob- served the laws of God rather than of men. My offence is that I have had at heart too much the spiritual regeneration of England, that I have come to preach the truth to my   DAYS OF 'JAMES I.      283 brethren who are in that darkness out of which the spirit of God hath led me happily, as this hour and this presence bear me witness. Oh! good souls, I have prayed daily that God would avert from this realm his stripes and punish. ments which impend over it for the blood of the saints which it has poured out: but I fear me the time shall come when your children shall groan under his hand; when the evils of that system of individuality resulting in worldliness, which hath been established in England by the new reli- gion, shall work out its appointed destiny; when the poor shall toil, and groan, and sweat, and starve; when mammon shall reign in this blessed land, where once Christ and his church held sway. When your descendants shall be the slaves of gold-and the gold-power, tied to wheels, and harnessed to the draught, and broken to the yoke like oxen. Then, oh Englishmen! will ye turn back yearning to-the faith of your fathers-that faith which made England great and her people free and happy! For the honor and glory of my master, in the regeneration of England I have la- bored. Oh, may my blood arise to heaven as a prayer for the accomplishment of that hope! "Oh God, who didst preserve thy church for three hun- dred years amidst the darkness of the Catacombs, making the blood of martyrs fruitful of Christians, and didst at length bring forth her, thy holy spouse, triumphant over the powers of evil, to guide, 'enlighten, and save; in thy un- speakable mercy hear our prayers to thee, and in thy chosen time send down thy grace upon England and restore her to the faith! "Oh, my countrymen, there is no treason in my heart! If my death would benefit my sovereign either in soul or body, I would not be less willing to lay down my life than I now am for God's honor aid the testimony of the truth!"   284       WILLITOPT, OR THE Then, with his outstretched hands, he bade farewell. to all such in that crowd as might be his friends, and bade them to bear to his family, if any there knew-him and them, his parting words, his last prayer for the salvation of their souls. At this instant, a choking voice arose from the crowd. "Brother, die happy! thou hast conquered!" and the speaker darted away from the cruel scene. The condemned raised his hands towards heaven in thanks; for he knew the voice of his brother. The executioner approached him and adjusted the cord around his neck, and, at the same time, asked his forgive- ness. "Forgive thee? Yes, and thank thee!" exclaimed the priest. "Thou-art about to bestow on me a great favor, to bring me to exceeding happiness." Then he knelt and prayed silently and fervently. The sheriff waved his hand in signal to the executioner: the trap fell: in the midst of prayer the victim was hurled into the death struggle. Then the chord was cut, and the yet living man fell-to the earth. The butchers rushed upon, held fast his convulsed limbs, and the knife of the execu- tioner ripped open his body. Then while the hangman's hands were grappling with the throbbing heart, the voice of the martyr still faintly prayed that God would send down his mercy upon England and bring her back to the true faith. Ere the prayer died upon his lips, that true heart was consuming in the flames! Not in death, did the horrid tragedy pause. The limbs of the senseless corpse were severed and fixed upon poles set over the city gates-to blacken and wither in the winds of heaven.

"Holy, ye were, and good and true! -No change can cloud my tfoughts of you; Guide me like you to live and die, And reach my Father's house on high!"-HEMANS. EORGE SCOTT, for a time, hung around the pri- son at Oxford, in the hope of obtaining admit- ance to Mr. Travers and his family. He attempted to bribe the jailors,obut in vain. The penalty for non-con- formity must be paid-fine and imprisonment. The fine he was determined should be raised; and if money could effect it, the imprisonment should be shortened. Then, with his father and mother, a few days after the trial he set out for Scottsfield. The health of his mother had been affected by her long and severe trials, and the revivifying effect, which their triumphant acquittal would naturally have produced, had been marred by the sorrowful fate of her son of whom she could yet learn nothing, and by the renewed imprisonment of Mr. Travers and his family. The party travelled by slow journeys, dividing into two days the usual work of one. On the evening of the fourth day, as they approached the village of Underwood, they observed a party of the country people gathered at the cross roads, seemingly wound up to a high pitch of rustic excitement and horror. "What is the matter, my good friends?" said George Scott, riding up and reining in his horse among the crowd. The people shouted with a momentary joy as they recog- nised Scott, but their congratulations over, they relapsed into silence. George Scott repeated his question.   WILLITOFT, OR THE DAYS OF JAMES I.   287 "Matter, Sir! Why look you there," replied one of the men, "and see that stake!" "Well, and what of that stake," asked Scott," smiling. "Nay, you need not laugh, Sir. It is horrid enough. That is a suicide's grave!" "Ha! and who was it?" "Why, Sir, yesterday the man was found in the woods, hung up by the neck, dead, and the crownier's 'quest sat upon him, and found a verdict of felo de se. So he was brought here to the cross roads and buried, and a stake driven through his body, according to law."s "And what was his name?" asked George Scott, with a shudder. "Why, he was the pursuivant who was down here as you remember, his name was Rodewell!" "Gracious Heaven! thy ways are inscrutable! A week ago and this man seemed to have-triumphed. He revelled in my father's house, we were in chains and dungeons with death staring us in the face. Now, he is in a felon's grave, 'and we are restored to freedom, hope, and life!"And striking'his spurs, he rode rapidly to the side of the carri- age, and ordered the coachman to drive his horses quickly, lest the fearful tragedy might become known to his mother and sensibly affect her shattered nerves. As they approached Scottsfield, the tenants were drawn out in array to welcome them, and among them shone the joyous rubicund features of Master Giles Horstead. That night, bonfires were blazing on every hill within the limits of the estate, and the hostelry of Underwood kept open -house to all comers. But at the mansion, only sad hearts were grouped together. In a few days, George Scott set out to learn the destiny of his brother, and to bring relief to Mr. Travers and his   $W8ILLITOFT-, OR THE family. The fine was paid, the imprisonment commuted, and the order for their discharge obtained. At the office of the governor he presented the order. "You shall receive them," said the official, and calling an officer, he bade him deliver over the prisoners to his charge. They went together up flights of steps, along cor- ridors, and, at length, they paused before the cell of Mr. Travers. The jailor unlocked the door and cast it open. Stretched out upon a pallet, cold and still, reclined the form of the father. The countenance of the dead was calm and mild, seeming rather like one in sleep than the chill of the dark hour. Down  by that pallet, with her face buried in the coarse covering, knelt the weeping orphan child of thedeparted. Stifled sobs seemed choking her; her hands grasped the bed convulsively. It was the agony of sorrow. Near her was her aunt. As the door opened wide, the heart-stricken girl raised up her head, her eyes were tear- less, her cheeks flushed and feverish, her look almost wild. "Monsters, leave us to our sorrows!" she cried distract- edly, for she thought that the jailors had come to rob them of the dead. She turned her head and beheld George Scott, standing horror stricken on the threshold. With a  shrill cry, she rushed into his arms. "  Oh, save him, George, he is dying!" Then recollect- ing herself--, Alas, he is dead!" and for the first time tears came to her relief. "'Too late, too late, oh God!" exclaimed Scott in agony, and they knelt beside the dead. At length he st'oke. "Oh, my departed friend, my father here do I renew my pledge, here do I swear to be faithful and true, through life,  to protect her, to love her, to guard her, thy daughter, whom thou gavest me as thy legacy!"   DAYS OF JAMES I.       289 "Not, thus George," she whispered through her tears. "' Yes now, and thus, by that soleinn promise made in the hour of parting, here do I fulfil his wishes by renewing my vows, which in life he blessed 1" On the morrow, a sad train wound out from the gates of Oxford, where so much of sorrow had come upon the per- secuted-a hearse and two mourning carriages. Late on the following night, by the light of torches, it wound its way up the steep path to Willitoft, joined by many a weep- ing rustic, and a few sad hearted gentlemen. In the great hall of his ancestral dwelling they laid down the body, ere they confided it to the keeping of its mother earth in the family cemetery. A few weeks more, and George Scott was on his way to London. He had heard that a priest was about to suffer. Could it be his brother? He reached the city in time to take his place at Tyburn, to see that brother on the scaffold, and to hear his dying words. "Thou hast conquered," he exclaimed, as he hurried away from the horrid spectacle, which was about to be enacted. "Thou hast conquered, my brother! Without aid from heaven thou couldst not thus meet these fearful tortures. Thy faith must be good and noble! Thy brethren die martyrs for it, and thou! Alas! farewell, brother, sainted brother!" That night, from the city gates disappeared the relics of the martyred priest. None knew who had carried them away, or whither they had been taken. A midnight funeral! The wind was high, waving the early blossoms of June and the foliage of the trees. Torches tossed in the breeze, 25   290       WILLITOFT, OR THE and flashed along the avenues of Scottsfield. A train of mourners passed along beneath a tall pine: embowered with shrubs and flowers, under a bank of myrtle, a grave was dug. By its side they laid down a plain coffin, upon which was inscribed, ," W. S. Req. in pace." Then a priest in sacerdotal robes, passed around the grave sprinkling it with holy water, and reciting the solemn burial service of the Catholic Church. The dead was lowered into the grave, and the priest, as he concluded the service, exclaimed: "Rest in peace, holy martyr! through thy death hath come light into- thy father's household!" Then the grave was filled up, and the sod of myrtle with its purple flowers, replaced to bloom upon it like a crown. The mourners departed; and the dead was left with the Lord. YEARs after the event just detailed, a travelling carriage drove into the quiet town of Underwood. It-contained a gentleman and lady, and a little boy some four years of age. There seemed to be a shade of sadness upon the brows of the two elder travellers; but the little child was full of life and gladness, with a thousand playful questions to ask, and his merry laugh ever ringing out. The lady was young and beautiful, but the fairness of her complexion seemed some- what browned by a southern sun. A tear would gather in her eye, occasionally, as she gazed around upon the scene. Then her companion would address her in a foreign tongue, and she would dry her eyes, kiss the child fondly, and min- gle in his delightful prattle. The carriage only paused long enough to rest the horses, and the travellers resumed their way, They took the route   DAYS OF JAMES I.       291 towards Willitoft, and remained there for awhile, and then turned towards Scottsfield. "And this is our home, Julia! here closes our pilgrim- age!" and George Scott assisted his wife to descend from the carriage. In a few moments more they were clasped in the arms of Mr. and Mrs: Scott, and of Julia's aunt, who had taken up her residence at Scottsfield. A thousand times was that noble little boy caressed. "Come to my arms, William, my child," said his grand- mother, whom care and sorrow and growing years had made venerable, and she pressed him to her bosom. "Ah! how like him who is-" and she paused, unable to proceed. "In heaven!" said the grandfather, calmly, yet with a shade of sadness in his voice. George Scott and Julia had passed from the room to- gether. They walked along the gravelled paths of the broad garden--they reached the tall pine beneath whose shadow rested their brother. Over the grave there stood a solid block of white marble cut in the form of a cross, and upon its arms were engraved the simple words: Til 0. 2Gpostolat. Beneb. pro fibe pasua ett. Down by that simple monument they knelt and prayed! At length they arose, and with calmer spirits returned into the house. "Do not forget him, my children!" said the old man, as they .re-entered, "through him, by the mercy of God, we were brought to the knowledge of the faith and received into the bosom of the holy Catholic Church!" "Yes, he is happy! Let us remember him, and he will pray for us, that we may die as blessedly as he! What, after all, my child, is sorrow and suffering in this world!"   292       WILLITOFT, OR THE said the mother, "the reward is in heaven. And thus I have learned to think of my martyred boy, not only without tears, but with a holy joy and pride. You, my children! be you always as sincere and good and pious as he was, seeking to do God's will in every condition, and you will be enabled to defy pain and sorrow, and death, as he did, by the all powerful grace of God!" GEORGE SCOTT and his wife soon removed to Willitoft, now the property of Julia, the old servants were re-assem- bled in the long closed and deserted family mansion, and there was always a place and a warm reception there for the wandering missionary of their faith, who came fearless of penal laws and death to minister to the children of the faith, and whom they cherished as if he had been that dearly re- membered brother. But the execution of the persecuting laws was soon much relaxed.- The growing strength of the Puritan faction had compelled Charles to seek about for new allies, and he knew that he might depend upon the faithful loyalty of the Catholics whom he had permitted to be persecuted. In 1622, he caused about four thousand to be released from the prisons of England, where they had been confined for the practice of their religion.* This new spirit gave peace for a time to the persecuted. John Hurlstone and his family returned in quiet to their little cottage,' and continued faithful to their church. Of Sir Henry Marsden it is only necessary to say that the disappointment of his schemes, brought a deep gloom over his mind, which was frightfully increased by the pangs "Wilson.   293 DAYS OF JAMES I.         29 of remorse. Lonely and secluded, he lived a miserable misanthrope, suspected and despised by all his neighbors. The unfortunate Alton, stricken in the midst of his downward career and brought to reflection, seriously re- newed his long abandoned inquiries into the truths of the Catholic Faith; and, having embraced them, became an useful assistant in one of the secret schools where the Ca- tholic youth found their only means of Christian education. At Willitoft and Scottsfield there was happiness, for the !?  memory of the departed father and the martyred brother was full of consolation, and ,prayer for their souls mingled sweetly with every placid recollection of the departed. NOTE TO p. 218. Such rumors, with no better foundation, were common through all that period.   ADIEU! GENTLE Reader! If thou hast followed me, in patience, through the dark and mournful scenes I have endeavored to portray, think not that I have loved to recall to mind the crimes and the bigotry of the past. To have laid my scene  in the "Land of the Sanctuary," and pictured its calm and quiet glory, would have pleased me better; but the contrast between persecution, and freedom of conscience, cannot be unfolded unless both be fully drawn. I have painted, with a weak and trembling hand, the former; it remains :for my readers to decide, whether I shall sketch the latter.' I deemed this idea worthy of expression, at a time, when, in England, a persecuting spirit is once more stirred up, which, though now only in the commencement of its exer- cise, may grow on what it feeds on, unless it be checked by a powerful and righteous public opinion. For this rea- son, I have painted the bloody deeds which this same spirit wrought in other days, that men may pause, now, ere they give full rein to it again. If I but awaken one mind to the dangers and injustice of an intolerant spirit I am satisfied. THE END.
