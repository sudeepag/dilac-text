               So! I let fall the curtain; he was dead. For at least half an hour I had stood there with the manuscript in my hand, watching that face settling in its last stillness, watching the finger of the Composer smoothing out the deeply furrowed lines on cheek and forehead,-the faint recollection of the light that had perhaps burned behind his childish eyes struggling up through the swarthy cheek, as if to clear the last world's dust from the atmosphere surrounding the man who had just refound his youth. His head rested on his hand-and so satisfied and content was his quiet attitude, that he looked as if resting from a long, wearisome piece of work he was glad to have finished. I don't know how it was, but I thought, oddly enough, in connection with him, of a little schoolfellow of mine years ago, who one day, in his eagerness to prove that he could jump further than some of his companions, upset an inkstand over his prize essay, and, overcome with mortification, disappointment, and vexation, burst into tears, hastily scratched his name from the list of competitors, and then rushed out of doors to tear his ruined essay into fragments; and we found him that afternoon lying on the grass, with his head on his hand, just as he lay now, having sobbed himself to sleep. 
               I dropped the curtains of the bed, drew those of the window more closely, to exclude the shrill winter wind that was blowing the slant sleet against the clattering window-panes, broke up the lump of cannel coal in the grate into a bright blaze that subsided into a warm, steady glow of heat and light, drew an arm-chair and a little table up to the cheerful fire, and sat down to read the manuscript which the quiet man behind the curtains had given me. Why shouldn't I (I was his physician) make myself as comfortable as possible at two o'clock of a stormy winter night, in a house that contained but two persons besides my German patient-a half-stupid serving-man, doubtless already asleep down-stairs, and myself? This is what I read that night, with the comfortable fire on one side, and Death, holding strange colloquy with the fitful, screaming, moaning wind, on the other. 
               As I wish simply to relate what has happened to me (thus the manuscript began), what I attempted, in what I sinned, and how I failed, I deem no introduction or genealogies necessary to the first part of my life. I was an only child of parents who were passionately fond of me-the more, perhaps, because an accident that had happened to me in my childhood rendered me for some years a partial invalid. One day (I was about five years old then), a gentleman paid a visit to my father, riding a splendid Arabian horse. Upon dismounting, he tied the horse near the steps of the piazza instead of the horseblock, so that I found I was just upon the level with the stirrup, standing at a certain elevation. Half as an experiment, to try whether I could touch the horse without his starting, I managed to get my foot into the stirrup, and so mounted upon his back. The horse, feeling the light burden, did start, broke from his fastening, and sped away with me on his back at the top of his speed. He ran several miles without stopping, and finished by pitching me off his back upon the ground in leaping a fence. This fall produced some disease of the spine, which clung to me till I was twelve years old, when it was almost miraculously cured by an itinerant Arab physician. He was generally pronounced to be a quack, but he certainly effected many wonderful cures, mine among others. 
               I had always been an imaginative child; and my long-continued sedentary life compelling me (a welcome compulsion) to reading as my chief occupation and amusement, I acquired much knowledge beyond my years. 
               My reading generally had one peculiar tone: a certain kind of mystery was an essential ingredient in the fascination that books which I considered interesting had for me. My earliest fairy tales were not those unexciting stories in which the good genius appears at the beginning of the book, endowing the hero with such an invincible talisman that suspense is banished from the reader's mind, too well enabled to foresee the triumph at the end; but stories of long, painful quests after hidden treasure-mysterious enchantments thrown around certain persons by witch or wizard, drawing the subject in charmed circles nearer and nearer to his royal or ruinous destiny-strange spells cast upon bewitched houses or places, that could be removed only by the one hand appointed by Fate. So I pored over the misty legends of the San Grail, and the sweet story of "The Sleeping Beauty," as my first literature; and as the rough years of practical boyhood trooped up to elbow my dreaming childhood out of existence, I fed the same hunger for the hidden and mysterious with Detective-Police stories, Captain Kidd's voyages, and wild tales of wrecks on the Spanish Main, of those vessels of fabulous wealth that strewed the deep sea's lap with gems (so the stories ran) of lustre almost rare enough to light the paths to their secret hiding-places. 
               But in the last year of my captivity as an invalid a new pleasure fell into my hands. I discovered my first book of travels in my father's library, and as with a magical key unlocked the gate of an enchanted realm of wondrous and ceaseless beauty. It was Sir John Mandeville who introduced me to this field of exhaustless delight; not a very trustworthy guide, it must be confessed-but my knowledge at that time was too limited to check the boundless faith I reposed in his narrative. It was such an astonishment to discover that men, black-coated and black-trousered men, such as I saw in crowds every day in the street from my sofa-corner (we had moved to the city shortly after my accident), had actually broken away from that steady stream of people, and had traversed countries as wild and unknown as the lands in the Nibelungen Lied, that my respect for the race rose amazingly. I scanned eagerly the sleek, complacent faces of the portly burghers, or those of the threadbare schoolmasters, thinned like carving-knives by perpetual sharpening on the steel of Latin syntax, in search of men who could have dared the ghastly terrors of the North with Ross or Parry, or the scorching jungles of the Equator with Burckhardt and Park. Cut off for so long a time from actual contact with the outside world, I could better imagine the brooding stillness of the Great Desert, I could more easily picture the weird ice-palaces of the Pole, waiting, waiting forever in awful state, like the deserted halls of the Walhalla for their slain gods to return, than many of the common street scenes in my own city, which I had only vaguely heard mentioned. 
               I followed the footsteps of the Great Seekers over the wastes, the untrodden paths of the world; I tracked Columbus across the pathless Atlantic,-heard, with Balboa, the "wave of the loud-roaring ocean break upon the long shore, and the vast sea of the Pacific forever crash on the beach,"-gazed with Corts on the temples of the Sun in the startling Mexican empire, or wandered with Pizarro through the silver-lined palaces of Peru. But a secret affection drew me to the mysterious regions of the East and South,-towards Arabia, the wild Ishmael bequeathing sworded Korans and subtile Aristotles as legacies to the sons of the freed-woman,-to solemn Egypt, riddle of nations, the vast, silent, impenetrable mystery of the world. By continual pondering over the footsteps of the Seekers, the Sought-for seemed to grow to vast proportions, and the Found to shrink to inappreciable littleness. For me, over the dreary ice-plains of the Poles, over the profound bosom of Africa, the far-stretching steppes of Asia, and the rocky wilds of America, a great silence brooded, and in the unexplored void faint footfalls could be heard here and there, threading their way in the darkness. But while the longing to plunge, myself, into these dim regions of expectation grew more intense each day, the prison-chains that had always bound me still kept their habitual hold upon me, even after my recovery. I dreamt not of making even the vaguest plans for undertaking explorations myself. So I read and dreamt, filling my room with wild African or monotonous Egyptian scenery, until I was almost weaned from ordinary Occidental life. 
               I passed four blissful years in this happy dream-life, and then it was abruptly brought to an end by the death of my father and mother almost simultaneously by an epidemic fever prevailing in the neighborhood. I was away from home at a bachelor uncle's at the time, and so was unexpectedly thrown on his hands, an orphan, penniless, except in the possession of the small house my father had owned in the country before our removal to the city, and to be provided for. My uncle placed me in a mercantile house to learn business, and, after exercising some slight supervision over me a few months, left me entirely to my own resources. As, however, he had previously taken care that these resources should be sufficient, I got along very well upon them, was regularly promoted, and in the space of six years, at the age of twenty-one, was in a rather responsible situation in the house, with a good salary. But my whole attention could not be absorbed in the dull routine of business; my most precious hours were devoted to reading, in which I still pursued my old childish track of speculation, with the difference that I exchanged Sindbad's valley of diamonds for Arabia Petra, Sir John Mandeville for Herodotus, and Robinson Crusoe for Belzoni and Burckhardt. Whether my interest in these Oriental studies arose from the fact of the house being concerned in the importation of the products of the Indies, or whether from the secret attraction that had drawn me Eastward since my earliest childhood, as if the Arab doctor had bewitched in curing me, I cannot say; probably it was the former, especially as the India business became gradually more and more intrusted to my hands. 
               Shortly after my twenty-first birthday, I received a note from my uncle, from whom I had not heard for a year or two, informing me that my father's house, which he had kept rented for me during the first years of my minority, had been without a tenant for a year; and as I had now come of age, I had better go down to D-- and take possession of it. This letter, touching upon a long train of associations and recollections, awoke an intense longing in me to revisit the home of my childhood, and meet those phantom shapes that had woven that spell in those dreaming years, which I sometimes thought I felt even now. So I obtained a short leave of absence, and started the next morning in the coach for D--. 
               It was what is called a "raw morning," for what reason I know not, for such days are really elaborated with the most exquisite finish. A soft gray mist hugged the country in a chilly embrace, while a fine rain fell as noiselessly as snow, upon soaked ground, drenched trees, and peevish houses. There is always a sense of wonder about a mist. The outlines of what we consider our hardest tangibilities are melted away by it into the airiest dream-sketches, our most positive and glaring facts are blankly blotted out, and a fresh, clean sheet left for some new fantasy to be written upon it, as groundless as the rest; our solid land dissolves in cloud, and cloud assumes the stability of land. For, after all, the only really tangible thing we possess is man's Will; and let the presence and action of that be withdrawn but for a few moments, and that mysterious Something which we vainly endeavor to push off into the Void by our pompous nothings of brick and plaster and stone, closes down upon us with the descending sky, writing Delendum on all behind us, Unknown on all before. At that time the only actual Now, that stands between these two infinite blanks, becomes identical with the mind itself, independent of accidents of situation or circumstance; and the mind thus becoming boldly prominent, amidst the fading away of physical things, stamps its own character upon its shadowy surroundings, moulding the supple universe to the shape of its emotions and feelings. 
                
               I was the only inside passenger, and there was nothing to check the entire surrender of my mind to all ghostly influence. So I lay stretched upon the cushions, staring blankly into the dense gray fog closing up all trace of our travelled road, or watching the light edges of the trailing mist curl coyly around the roofs of houses and then settle grimly all over them; the fantastic shapes of trees or carts distorted and magnified through the mist; the lofty outlines of some darker cloud stalking solemnly here and there, like enormous dumb overseers faithfully superintending the work of annihilation. The monotonous patter of the rain-drops upon the wet pavement or muddy roads, blending with the low whining of the wind and the steady rumble of the coach-wheels, seemed to make a kind of witch-chant, that wove with braided sound a weird spell about me, a charm fating me for some service, I knew not what. That chant moaned, it wailed, it whispered, it sang gloriously, it bound, it drowned me, it lapped me in an inextricable stream of misty murmuring, till I was perplexed, bewildered, enchanted. I felt surprised at myself, when, at the end of the day's journey, I carried my bag to the hotel, and ate my supper there as usual, and felt natural again only when, having obtained the key of my house, I sallied forth in the dim twilight to make it my promised visit. 
               I found the place, as I had expected, in a state of utter desolation. A year's silence had removed it so far from the noisy stream of life that flowed by it, that I felt, as I pushed at the rusty door-lock, as if I were passing into some old garret of Time, where he had thrown forgotten rubbish too worn-out and antiquated for present use. A strong scent of musk greeted me at my entrance, which I found came from a box of it that had been broken upon the hall floor. I had stowed it away (it was a favorite perfume fume with me, because it was so associated with my Arabian Nights' stories) upon a ledge over the door, where it had rested undisturbed while the house was tenanted, and had been now probably dislodged by rats. But I half fancied that this odor which impregnated the air of the whole house was the essence of that atmosphere in which, as a child, I had communicated with Burckhardt and Belzoni-and that, expelled by the solid, practical, Occidental atmosphere of the last few years, it had flowed back again, in these last silent months, in anticipation of my return. 
               Like a prudent householder, I made the tour of the house with a light I had provided myself with, and mentally made memoranda of repairs, alterations, etc., for rendering it habitable. My last visit was to be to the garret, where many of my books yet remained. As I passed once more through the parlor, on my way thither, a ray of light from my raised lamp fell upon the wall that I had thought blank, and a majestic face started suddenly from the darkness. So sudden was the apparition, that for the moment I was startled, till I remembered that there had formerly been a picture in that place, and I stopped to examine it. It was a head of the Sphinx. The calm, grand face was partially averted, so that the sorrowful eyes, almost betraying the aching secret which the still lips kept sacred, were hidden,-only the slight, tender droop in the corner of the mouth told what their expression might be. Around, forever stretched the endless sands-the mystery of life found in the heart of death. That mournful, eternal face gave me a strange feeling of weariness and helplessness. I felt as if I had already pressed eagerly to the other side of the head, still only to find the voiceless lips and mute eyes. Strange tears sprang to my eyes; I hastily brushed them away, and, leaving the Sphinx, mounted to my garret. 
                
               But the riddle followed me. I sat down on the floor, beside a box of books, and somewhat listlessly began pulling it over to examine the contents. The first book I took hold of was a little worn volume of Herodotus that had belonged to my father. I opened it; and as if it, too, were a link in the chain of influences which I half felt was being forged around me, it opened at the first part of "Euterpe," where Herodotus is speculating upon the phenomena of the Nile. Twenty-two hundred years,-I thought,-and we are still wondering; the Sphinx is still silent, and we yet in the darkness! Alas, if this riddle be insoluble, how can we hope to find the clue to deeper problems? If there are places on our little earth whither our feet cannot go, curtains that our hands cannot withdraw, how can we expect to track paths through realms of thought,-how to voyage in those airy, impalpable regions whose existence we are sure of only while we are there voyaging? 
                      
                        "Nilus in extremum fugit perterritus orbem 
                        Occuluitque caput, quod adhuc latet." 
                     
                   Lost through reckless presumption, might not earnest humility recover that mysterious lurking-place? Might not one, by devoted toil, by utter self-sacrifice, with eyes purified by long searching from worldly and selfish pollution,-might not such a one tear away the veil of centuries, and, even though dying in the attempt, gain one look into this arcanum? Might not I?-The unutterable thought thrilled me and left me speechless, even in thinking. I strained my forehead against the darkness, as if I could grind the secret from the void air. Then I experienced the following mental sensation,-which, being purely mental, I cannot describe precisely as it was, but will translate it as nearly as possible into the language of physical phenomena. 
               It was as if my mind-or, rather, whatever that passive substratum is that underlies our volition and more truly represents ourselves-were a still lake, lying quiet and indifferent. Presently the sense of some coming Presence sent a breathing ripple over its waters; and immediately afterwards it felt a sweep as of trailing garments, and two arms were thrown around it, and it was pressed against a "life-giving bosom," whose vivifying warmth interpenetrating the whole body of the lake, its waters rose, moved by a mighty influence, in the direction of that retreating Presence; and again, though nothing was seen, I felt surely whither was that direction. It was NILEWARD. I knew, with the absolute certainty of intuition, that henceforth I was one of the kletoi the chosen,-selected from thousands of ages, millions of people, for this one destiny. Henceforth a sharp dividing-line cut me off from all others: their appointment was to trade, navigate, eat and drink, marry and give in marriage, and the rest; mine was to discover the Source of the Nile. Hither had all the threads of my life been converging for many years; they had now reached their focus, and henceforth their course was fixed. 
               I was scarcely surprised the next day at receiving a letter from my employers appointing me to a situation as supercargo of a merchant-vessel bound on a three years' voyage to America and China,-in returning thence, to sail up the Mediterranean, and stop at Alexandria. I immediately wrote an acceptance, and then busied myself about obtaining a three years' tenant for my house. As the house was desirable and well-situated, this business was soon arranged; and then, as I had nothing further to do in the village, I left it for the last time, as it proved, and returned to the city,-whence, after a fortnight of preparation, I set sail on my eventful enterprise. Although our voyage was filled with incident that in another place would be interesting enough to relate, yet here I must omit all mention of it, and, passing over three years, resume my narrative at Alexandria, where I left the vessel, and finally broke away from mercantile life. 
               From Alexandria I travelled to Cairo, where I intended to hire a servant and a boat, for I wished to try the water-passage in preference to the land. The cheapness of labor and food rendered it no difficult matter to obtain my boat, and provision it for a long voyage,-for how long I did not tell the Egyptian servant whom I hired to attend me. A certain feeling of fatality caused me to make no attempt at disguise, although disguise was then much more necessary than it has been since: I openly avowed my purpose of travelling on the Nile for pleasure, as a private European, My accoutrements were simple and few. Arms, of course, I carried, and the actual necessaries for subsistence; but I entirely forgot to prepare for sketching, scientific surveys, etc. My whole mind was possessed with one idea; to see, to discover;-plans for turning my discoveries to account were totally foreign to my thoughts. 
               So, on the sixth of November, 1824, we set sail. I had been waiting three years to arrive at this starting-point,-my whole life, indeed, had been dumbly turning towards it,-yet now I commenced it with a coolness and tranquillity far exceeding that I had possessed on many comparatively trifling occasions. It is often so. We are borne along on the current like drift-wood, and, spying jutting rocks or tremendous cataracts ahead, fancy, "Here we shall be stranded, there buoyed up, there dashed in pieces over those falls,"-but, for all that, we glide over those threatened catastrophes in a very commonplace manner, and are aware of what we have been passing only upon looking back at them. So no one sees the great light shining from Heaven,-for the people are blear-eyed, and Saul is blinded. But as I left Cairo in the greatening distance, floating onward to the heart of the mysterious river, I floated also into the twin current of thought, that, flowing full and impetuous from the shores of the peopled Mediterranean, follows the silent river, and tracks it to its hidden lurking-place in the blank desert. Onward, past the breathless sands of the Libyan Desert, past the hundred-gated Thebes, past the stone guardians of Abou-Simbel, waiting in majestic patience for their spell of silence to be broken,-onward. It struck me curiously to come to the cataract, and be obliged to leave my boat at the foot of the first fall, and hire another above the second,-a forcible reminder that I was travelling backwards, from the circumference to the centre from which that circumference had been produced, faintly feeling my way along a tide of phenomena to the noumenon supporting them. So we always progress: from arithmetic to geometry, from observation to silence, from practice to theory, and play with edged tools long before we know what knives mean. For, like Hop-o'-my-Thumb and his brothers, we are driven out early in the morning to the edge of the forest, and are obliged to grope our way back, to the little house whence we come, by the crumbs dropped on the road. Alack! how often the birds have eaten our bread, and we are captured by the giant lying in wait! 
               On we swept, leaving behind the burning rocks and dreary sands of Egypt and Lower Nubia, the green woods and thick acacias of Dongola, the distant pyramids of Mount Birkel, and the ruins of Mero, just discovered footmarks of Ancient Ethiopia descending the Nile to bequeathe her glory and civilization to Egypt. At Old Dongola, my companion was very anxious that we should strike across the country to Shendy, to avoid the great curve of the Nile through Ethiopia. He found the sail somewhat tedious, as I could speak but little Egyptian, which I had picked up in scraps-he, no German or English. I managed to overrule his objections, however, as I could not bear to leave any part of the river unvisited; so we continued the water-route to the junction of the Blue and the White Nile, where I resolved to remain a week, before continuing my route. The inhabitants regarded us with some suspicion, but our inoffensive appearance so far conquered their fears that they were prevailed upon to give us some information about the country, and to furnish us with a fresh supply of rice, wheat, and dourra, in exchange for beads and bright-colored cloths, which I had brought with me for the purpose of such traffic, if it should be necessary. Bruce's discovery of the source of the Blue Nile, fifty, years before, prevented the necessity of indecision in regard to my route; and so completely was I absorbed in the one object of my journey, that the magnificent scenery and ruins along the Blue Nile, which had so fascinated Cailliaud, presented few allurements for me. 
               My stay was rather longer than I had anticipated, as it was found necessary to make some repairs upon the boat; and, inwardly fretting at each hour's delay, I was eager to seize the first opportunity for starting again. On the 1st of March I made a fresh beginning for the more unknown and probably more perilous portion of my voyage, having been about four months in ascending from Cairo. As my voyage had commenced about the abatement of the sickly season, I had experienced no inconvenience from the climate, and it was in good spirits that I resumed my journey. For several days we sailed with little eventful occurring,-floating on under the cloudless sky, rippling a long white line through the widening surface of the ever-flowing river, through floating beds of glistening lotus-flowers, past undulating ramparts of foliage and winged ambak-blossoms guarding the shores, scaled by adventurous vines that triumphantly waved their banners of white, and purple, and yellow from the summit, winding amid bowery islands studding the broad stream like gems, smoothly stemming the rolling flood of the river, flowing, ever flowing,-lurking in the cool shade of the dense mimosa forests, gliding noiselessly past the trodden lairs of hippopotami and lions, slushing through the reeds swaying to and fro in the green water, still borne along against the silent current of the mysterious river, flowing, ever flowing. 
               We had now arrived at the land of the Dinkas, where the river, by broadening too much upon a low country, had become partially devoured by marsh and reeds, and our progress was very slow, tediously dragging over a sea of water and grass. I had become a little tired of my complete loneliness, and was almost longing for some collision with the tribes of savages that throng the shore, when the incident occurred that determined my whole future life. One morning, about seven o'clock, when the hot sun had already begun to rob the day of the delicious freshness lingering around a tropical night, we happened to be passing a tract of firmer land than we had met with for some time, and I directed the vessel towards the shore, to gather some of the brilliant lotus-flowers that fringed the banks. As we neared the land, I threw my gun, without which I never left the boat, on the bank, preparatory to leaping out, when I was startled by hearing a loud, cheery voice exclaim in English: "Hilloa! not so fast, if you please!"-and first the head and then the sturdy shoulders of a white man raised themselves slowly from the low shrubbery by which they were surrounded. He looked at us for a minute or two, and nodded with a contented air that perplexed me exceedingly. 
               "So," he said, "you have come at last; I am tired of waiting for you;" and he began to collect his gun, knife, etc., which were lying on the ground beside him. 
               "And who are you," I returned, "who lie in wait for me? I think, sir, you have the advantage." 
               Here the stranger interrupted me with a hearty laugh. 
               "My dear fellow," he cried, "you are entirely mistaken. The technical advantage that you attribute to me is an error, as I do not have the honor of knowing your name, though you may know mine without further preface-Frederick Herndon; and the real advantage which I wish to avail myself of, a boat, is obviously on your side. The long and the short of it is," he added (composedly extracting himself from the brushwood), "that, travelling up in this direction for discovery and that sort of thing, you know, I heard at Sennaar that a white man with an Egyptian servant had just left the town, and was going in my direction in a boat. So I resolved to overtake them, and with their, or your, permission, join company. But they, or you, kept just in advance, and it was only by dint of a forced march in the night that I passed you. I learned at the last Dinka village that no such party had been yet seen, and concluded to await your arrival here, where I pitched my tent a day and a night waiting for you. I am heartily glad to see you, I assure you." 
               With this explanation, the stranger made a spring, and leaped upon the yacht. 
               "Upon my word," said I, still bewildered by his sudden appearance, "you are very unceremonious." 
               "That," he rejoined, "is a way we Americans have. We cannot stop to palaver. What would become of our manifest destiny? But since you are so kind, I will call my Egyptian. Times are changed since we were bondsmen in Egypt, have they not? Ah, I forgot, you are not an American, and therefore cannot claim even our remote connection with the Ten Lost Tribes." Then raising his voice, "Here, Ibrahim!" 
               Again a face, but this time a swarthy one, emerged from behind a bush, and in answer to a few directions in his own dialect the man came down to the boat, threw in the tent and some other articles of traveller's furniture, and sprang in with the nonchalance of his master. 
               A little recovered from my first surprise, I seized the opportunity of a little delay in getting the boat adrift again to examine my new companion. He was standing carelessly upon the little deck of the vessel where he had first entered, and the strong morning light fell full upon his well-knit figure, and apparently handsome face. The forehead was rather low, prominent above the eyebrows, and with keen, hollow temples, but deficient both in comprehensiveness and ideality. The hazel eyes were brilliant, but restless and shallow,-the mouth of good size, but with few curves, and perhaps a little too close for so young a face. The well-cut nose and chin, and clean fine outline of face, the self-reliant pose of the neck, and confident set of the shoulders, characterized him as decisive and energetic, while the pleasant and rather boyish smile that lighted up his face dispelled presently the peculiarly hard expression I had at first found in analyzing it. Whether it was the hard, shrewd light from which all the tender and delicate grace of the early morning had departed, I knew not; but it struck me that I could not find a particle of shade, in his whole appearance. I seemed at once to take him in, as one sees the whole of a sunny country where there are no woods, or mountains, or valleys. And in fact, I never did find any,-never any cool recesses in his character; and as no sudden depths ever opened in his eyes, so nothing was ever left to be revealed in his character;-like them, it could be sounded at once. That picture of him, standing there on my deck, with an indefinite expression of belonging to the place, as he would have belonged on his own hearth-rug at home, often recurred to me, again to be renewed and confirmed. 
               And thus carelessly was swept into my path, as a stray waif, that man who would in one little moment change my whole life! It is always so. Our life sweeps onward like a river, brushing in here a little sand, there a few rushes, till the accumulated drift-wood chokes the current, or some larger tree falling across it turns it into a new channel. 
               I had been so long unaccustomed to company that I found it quite a pleasant change to have some one to talk to; some one to sympathize with I neither wanted nor expected; I certainly did not find such a one in my new acquaintance. For the first two or three days I simply regarded him with the sort of wondering curiosity with which we examine a new natural phenomenon of any sort. His perfect self-possession and coolness, the nil-admiran and nil-agitari atmosphere which surrounded him, excited my admiration at first, till I discovered that it arose, not from the composure of a mind too deep-rooted to be swayed by external circumstances, but rather from a peculiar hardness and unimpressibility of temperament that kept him on the same level all the time. He had been born at a certain temperature, and still preserved it, from a sort of vis inerti of constitution. This impenetrability had the effect of a somewhat buoyant disposition, not because he could be buoyed on the tide of any strong emotion, but because few things could disturb or excite him. Unable to grasp the significance of anything outside of himself and his attributes, he took immense pride in stamping his character, his nationality, his practicality, upon every series of circumstances by which he was surrounded: he sailed up the Nile as if it were the Mississippi; although a well-enough-informed man, he practically ignored the importance of any city anterior to the Plymouth Settlement, or at least to London, which had the honor of sending colonists to New England; and he would have discussed American politics in the heart of Africa, had not my ignorance upon the topic generally excluded it from our conversation. He had what is most wrongly termed an exceedingly practical mind,-that is, not one that appreciates the practical existence and value of thought as such, considering that a praxis, but a mind that denied the existence of a thought until it had become realized in visible action. 
               "'The end of a man is an action, and not a thought, though it be the noblest,' as Carlyle has well written," he triumphantly quoted to me, as, leaning over the little railing of the yacht, watching, at least I was, the smooth, green water gliding under the clean-cutting keel, we had been talking earnestly for some time. "A thought has value only as it is a potential action; if the action be abortive, the thought is as useless as a crank that fails to move an engine-wheel." 
               "Then, if action is the wheel, and thought only the crank, what does the body of your engine represent? For what purpose are your wheels turning? For the sake of merely moving?" 
               "No," said he, "moving to promote another action, and that another,-and--so on ad infinitum" 
               "Then you leave out of your scheme a real engine, with a journey to accomplish, and an end to arrive at; for so wheels would only move wheels, and there would be an endless chain of machinery, with no plan, no object for its existence. Does not the very necessity we feel of having a reason for the existence, the operation of anything, a large plan in which to gather up all ravelled threads of various objects, proclaim thought as the final end, the real thing, of which action, more especially human action, is but the inadequate visible expression? What kinds of action does Carlyle mean, that are to be the wheels for our obedient thoughts to set in motion? Hand, arm, leg, foot action? These are all our operative machinery. Does he mean that our 'noblest thought' is to be chained as a galley-slave to these, to give them means for working a channel through which motive power may be poured in upon them? Are we to think that our fingers and feet may move and so we live, or they to run for our thought, and we live to think?" 
               "Supposing we are," said Herndon, "what practical good results from knowing it? Action for action's sake, or for thinking's sake, is still action, and all that we have to look out for. What business have the brakemen at the wheels with the destiny of the train? Their business is simply to lock and unlock the wheels; so that their end is in the wheels, and not in the train." 
               "A somewhat dreary end," I said, half to myself. "The whole world, then, must content itself with spinning one blind action out of another; which means that we must continually alter or displace something, merely to be able to displace and alter something else." 
               "On the contrary, we exchange vague speculative mystifications for definite tangible fact. In America we have too much reality, too many iron and steam facts, to waste much time over mere thinking. That, sir, does for a sleepy old country, begging your pardon like yours; but for one that has the world's destiny in its hands,-that is laying iron foot-paths from the Atlantic to the Pacific for future civilization to take an evening stroll along to see the sun set,-that is converting black wool into white cotton, to clothe the inhabitants of Borrioboolagha,-that is trading, farming, electing, governing, fighting, annexing, destroying, building, puffing, blowing, steaming, racing, as our young two-hundred-year-old is,-we must work, we must act, and think afterwards. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might." 
               "And what," I said, "when hand-and-foot-action shall have ceased? Will you then allow some play for thought-action?" 
               "We have no time to think of that," he returned, walking away, and thus stopping our conversation. 
               The man was consistent in his theory at least. Having exalted physical motion (or action) to the place he did, he refused to see that the action he prized was more valuable through the thought it developed; consequently he reduced all actions to the same level, and prided himself upon stripping a deed of all its marvellousness or majesty. He did uncommon things in such a matter-of-fact way that he made them common by the performance. The faint spiritual double which I found lurking behind his steel and iron he either solidified with his metallic touch or pertinaciously denied its existence. 
               "Plato was a fool," he said, "to talk of an ideal table; for, supposing he could see it, and prove its existence, what good could it do? You can neither eat off it, nor iron on it, nor do anything else with it; so, for all practical purposes, a pine table serves perfectly well without hunting after the ideal. I want something that I can go up to, and know it is there by seeing and touching." 
                
               "But," said I, "does not that very susceptibility to bodily contact remove the table to an indefinite distance from you? If we can see and handle a thing, and yet not be able to hold that subtile property of generic existence, by which, one table being made, an infinite class is created, so real that tables may actually be modelled on it, and yet so indefinite that you cannot set your hand on any table or collection of tables, and say, 'It is here,'-if we can be absolutely conscious that we see the table, and yet have no idea how its image reflected on our retina can produce that absolute consciousness, does not the table grow dim and misty, and slip far away out of reach, of apprehension, much more of comprehension?" 
               "Stuff!" cried my companion. "If your metaphysics lead to proving that a board that I am touching with my hand is not there, I'll say, as I have already said, 'Throw (meta) physics to the dogs! I'll none of it!' A fine preparation for living in a material word, where we have to live in matter, by matter, and for matter, to wind one's self up in a snarl that puts matter out of reach, and leaves us nothing to live in, or by, or for! Now you, for instance, are not content with this poor old Nile as it stands, but must go fussing and wondering and mystifying about it till you have positively nothing of a river left. I look at the water, the banks, the trees growing on them, the islands in which we get occasionally entangled; here, at least, I have a real, substantial river-not equal for navigation to the Ohio or Mississippi, but still very fair. Confound these flies!" he added, parenthetically, making a vigorous plunge at a dark cloud of the little pests that were closing down upon us. 
               "Then you see nothing strange and solemn in this wonderful stream? nothing in the weird civilization crouching at the feet, vainly looking to the head of its master hidden in the clouds? nothing in the echoing footsteps of nations passing down its banks to their destiny? nothing in the solemn, unbroken silence brooding over the fountain whence sprang this marvellous river, to bear precious gifts to thousands and millions, and again retreat unknown? Is there no mystery in unsolved questions, no wonder in miracles, no awe in inapproachability?" 
               "I see," said he, steadily, "that a river of some thousand miles long has run through a country peopled by contented, or ignorant, or barbarous people, none of whom, of course, would take the slightest interest in tracing the river; that the dangers that have guarded the marvellous secret, as you call it, are not intrinsic to the secret itself, but are purely accidental and contingent. There is no more reason why the source of the Nile should not be found than that of the Connecticut; so I do not see that it is really at all inapproachable or awful." 
               "What in the world, Herndon," cried I, in desperation, "what in the name of common sense ever induced you to set out on this expedition? What do you want to discover the source of the Nile for?" 
               He answered with the ready air of one who has long ago made up his mind confidently on the subject he is going to speak about. 
               "It has long been evident to me, that civilization, flowing in a return current from America, must penetrate into Africa, and turn its immense natural advantages to such account that it shall become the seat of the most flourishing and important empires of the earth. These, however, should be consolidated, and not split up into multitudinous missionary stations. If a stream of immigration could be started from the eastern side, up the Nile for instance, penetrating to the interior, it might meet the increased tide of a kindred nature from the west, and uniting somewhere in the middle of Soudan, the centra point of action, the capital city could be founded there, as a heart for the country, and a complete system of circulation be established. By this method of entering the country at both sides simultaneously, of course its complete subjugation could be accomplished in half the time that it would take for a body of emigrants, however large, to make headway from the western coast alone. About the source of the Nile I intend to mark out the site for my city, and then--" 
               "And call it," I added, "Herndonville." 
               "Perhaps," he said, gravely. "At all events, my name will be inseparably connected with the enterprise; and if I can get the steamboat started during my lifetime, I shall make a comfortable fortune from the speculation." 
               "What a gigantic scheme!" I exclaimed. 
               "Ah," he said, complacently, "we Americans don't stick at trifles." 
               "Oh, marvellous practical genius of America!" I cried? "to eclipse Herodotus and Diodorus, not to mention Bruce and Cailliaud, and inscribe Herndonville on the arcanum of the Innermost! If the Americans should discover the origin of evil, they would run up penitentiaries all over the country, modelled to suit 'practical purposes.'" 
               "I think that would pay," said Herndon, reflectively. 
               But though I then stopped the conversation, yet I felt its influence afterwards. The divine enthusiasm for knowing, that had inspired me for the last three years, and had left no room for any other thought in connection with the discovery-this enthusiasm felt chilled and deadened. I felt reproached that I had not thought of founding a Pottsville or Jenkinsville, and my grand purpose seemed small and vague and indefinite. The vivid, living thoughts that had enkindled me fell back cold and lifeless into the tedious, reedy water. For we had now reached the immense shallow lake that Werne has since described, and the scenery had become flat and monotonous, as if in sympathy with the low, marshy place to which my mind had been driven. The intricate windings of the river, after we had passed the lake, rendered the navigation very slow and difficult; and the swarms of flies that plagued us for the first time seriously, brought petty annoyances to view more forcibly than we had experienced in all our voyage before. 
               After some days' pushing in this way, now driven by a strong head wind almost back from our course, again, by a sudden change, carried rapidly many miles on our journey-after some days of this sailing, we arrived at a long, low reef of rocks. The water here became so shallow and boisterous that further attempt at sailing was impossible, and we determined to take our boat to pieces as much as we could, and carry it with us, while we walked along the shore of the river. I concluded, from the marked depression in the ground we had just passed, that there must be a corresponding elevation about here, to give the water a sufficient head to pass over the high ground below; and the almost cataract appearance of the river added strength to my hypothesis. We were all four armed to the teeth, and the natives had shown themselves, hitherto, either so friendly or so indifferent that we did not have much apprehension on account of personal safety. So we set out with beating hearts. Our path was exceedingly difficult to traverse, leading chiefly among low trees and over the sharp stones that had rolled from the river,-now close by the noisy stream, which babbled and foamed as if it had gone mad,-now creeping on our knees through bushes, matted with thick, twining vines,-now wading across an open morass,-now in mimosa woods, or slipping in and out of the feathery dhelb-palms. 
               Since our conversation spoken of above, Herndon and I had talked little with each other, and now usually spoke merely of the incidents of the journey, the obstacles, etc.; we scarcely mentioned that for which we were both longing with intense desire, and the very thoughts of which made my heart beat quicker and the blood rush to my face. One day we came to a place where the river made a bend of about two miles and then passed almost parallel to our point of view. I proposed to Herndon that he should pursue the course of the river, and that I would strike a little way back into the country, and make a short cut across to the other side of the bend, where he and the men would stop, pitch our night-tent, and wait for me. Herndon assented, and we parted. The low fields around us changed, as I went on, to firm, hard, rising ground, that gradually became sandy and arid. The luxuriant vegetation that clung around the banks of the river seemed to be dried up little by little, until only a few dusty bushes and thorn-acacias studded in clumps a great, sandy, and rocky tract of country, which rolled monotonously back from the river border with a steadily increasing elevation. A sandy plain never gives me a sense of real substance; it always seems as if it must be merely a covering for something,-a sheet thrown over a bed where a dead man is lying. And especially here did this broad, trackless, seemingly boundless desert face me with its blank negation, like the old obstinate "No" which Nature always returns at first to your eager questioning. It provoked me, this staring reticence of the scenery, and stimulated me to a sort of dogged exertion. I think I walked steadily for about three hours over the jagged rocks and burning sands, interspersed with a few patches of straggling grass,-all the time up hill, with never a valley to vary the monotonous climbing,-until the bushes began to thicken in about the same manner as they had thinned into the desert, the grass and herbage herded closer together under my feet, and, beating off the ravenous sand, gradually expelled the last trace of it, a few tall trees strayed timidly among the lower shrubbery, growing more and more thickly, till I found myself at the border of an apparently extensive forest. The contrast was great between the view before and behind me. Behind lay the road I had achieved, the monotonous, toilsome, wearisome desert, the dry, formal introduction, as it were, to my coming journey. Before, long, cool vistas opened green through delicious shades,-a track seemed to be almost made over the soft grass, that wound in and out among the trees, and lost itself in interminable mazes. I plunged into the profound depths of the still forest, and confidently followed for path the first open space in which I found myself. 
               It was a strangely still wood for the tropics,-no chattering parroquets, no screaming magpies, none of the sneering, gibing dissonances that I had been accustomed to,-all was silent, and yet intensely living. I fancied that the noble trees took pleasure in growing, they were so energized with life in every leaf. I noticed another peculiarity,-there was little underbrush, little of the luxuriance of vines and creepers, which is so striking in an African forest. Parasitic life, luxurious idleness, seemed impossible here; the atmosphere was too sacred, too solemn, for the fantastic ribaldry of scarlet runners, of flaunting yellow streamers. The lofty boughs interlaced in arches overhead, and the vast dim aisles opened far down in the tender gloom of the wood and faded slowly away in the distance. And every little spray of leaves that tossed airily in the pleasant breeze, every slender branch swaying gently in the wind, every young sapling pushing its childish head panting for light through the mass of greenery and quivering with golden sunbeams, every trunk of aged tree gray with moss and lichens, every tuft of flowers, seemed thrilled and vivified by some wonderful knowledge which it held secret, some consciousness of boundless, inexhaustible existence, some music of infinite unexplored thought concealing treasures of unlimited action. And it was the knowledge, the consciousness, that it was unlimited which seemed to give such elastic energy to this strange forest. But at all events, it was such a relief to find the everlasting negation of the desert nullified, that my dogged resolution insensibly changed to an irrepressible enthusiasm, which bore me lightly along, scarcely sensible of fatigue. 
               The ascent had become so much steeper, and parts of the forest seemed to slope off into such sudden declivities and even precipices, that I concluded I was ascending a mountain; and, from the length of time I had been in the forest, I judged that it must be of considerable height. The wood suddenly broke off as it had begun, and, emerging from the cool shade, I found myself in a complete wilderness of rock. Rocks of enormous size were thrown about in apparently the wildest confusion, on the side of what I now perceived to be a high mountain. How near the summit I was I had no means of determining, as huge boulders blocked up the view at a few paces ahead. I had had about eight hours' tramp, with scarcely any cessation; yet now my excitement was too great to allow me to pause to eat or rest. I was anxious to press on, and determine that day the secret which I was convinced lay entombed in this sepulchre. So again I pressed onward,-this time more slowly,-having to pick my way among the bits of jagged granite filling up terraces sliced out of the mountain, around enormous rocks projecting across my path,-overhanging precipices that sheered straight down into dark abysses (I must have verged round to a different side from that I came up on),-creeping through narrow passages formed by the junction of two immense boulders. Tearing my hands with the sharp corners of the rocks, I climbed in vain hope of at last seeing the summit. Still rocks piled on rocks faced my wearied eyes, vainly striving to pierce through some chink or cranny into the space behind them. Still rocks, rocks, rocks, against whose adamantine sides my feeble will dashed restlessly and impotently. My eyeballs almost burst, as it seemed, in the intense effort to strain through those stone prison-walls. And by one of those curious links of association by which two distant scenes are united as one, I seemed again to be sitting in my garret, striving to pierce the darkness for an answer to the question then raised, and at the same moment passed over me, like the sweep of angels' wings, the consciousness of that Presence which had there infolded me. And with that consciousness, the eager, irritated waves of excitement died away, and there was a calm, in which I no longer beat like a caged beast against the never-ending rocks, but, borne irresistibly along in the strong current of a mighty, still emotion, pressed on with a certainty that left no room for excitement, because none for doubt. And so I came upon it. Swinging round one more rock, hanging over a breathless precipice, and landing upon the summit of the mountain, I beheld it stretched at my feet: a lake about five miles in circumference, bedded like an eye in the naked, bony rock surrounding it, with quiet rippling waters placidly smiling in the level rays of the afternoon sun,-the Unfathomable Secret, the Mystery of Ages, the long sought for, the Source of the Nile. 
                
               For, from a broad cleft in the rocks, the water hurled itself out of its hiding-place, and, dashing down over its rocky bed, rushed impetuous over the sloping country, till, its force being spent, it waded tediously through the slushing reeds of the hill-land again, and so rolled down to sea. For, while I stood there, it seemed as if my vision were preternaturally sharpened, and I followed the bright river in its course, through the alternating marsh and desert,-through the land where Zeus went banqueting among the blameless Ethiopians,-through the land where the African princes watched from afar the destruction of Cambyses's army,-past Mero, Thebes, Cairo; bearing upon its heaving; bosom anon the cradle of Moses, the gay vessels of the inundation festivals, the stately processions of the mystic priesthood, the gorgeous barge of Cleopatra, the victorious trireme of Antony, the screaming vessels of fighting soldiers, the stealthy boats of Christian monks, the glittering, changing, flashing tumult of thousands of years of life,-ever flowing, ever ebbing, with the mystic river, on whose surface it seethed and bubbled. And the germ of all this vast varying scene lay quietly hidden in the wonderful lake at my feet. But human life is always composed of inverted cones, whose bases, upturned to the eye, present a vast area, diversified with countless phenomena; but when the screen that closes upon them a little below the surface is removed, we shall be able to trace the many-lined figures, each to its simple apex,-one little point containing the essence and secret of the whole. Once or twice in the course of a lifetime are a few men permitted to catch a glimpse of these awful Beginnings,-to touch for a minute the knot where all the tangled threads ravel themselves out smoothly. I had found such a place,-had had such an ineffable vision,-and, overwhelmed with tremendous awe, I sank on my knees, lost in GOD. 
                
               After a while, as far as I can recollect, I rose and began to take the customary observations, marked the road by which I had come up the mountain, and planned a route for rejoining Herndon. But ere long all subordinate thoughts and actions seemed to be swallowed up in the great tide of thought and feeling that overmastered me. I scarcely remember anything from the time when the lake first burst upon my view, till I met Herndon again. But I know that, as the day was nearly spent, I was obliged to give up the attempt to travel back that night, especially as I now began to feel the exhaustion attendant upon my long journey and fasting. I could not have slept among those; rocks, eternal guardians of the mighty secret. The absence of all breathing, transitory existence but my own rendered it too solemn for me to dare to intrude there. So I went back to the forest (I returned much quicker than I had come), ate some supper, and, wrapped in a blanket I had brought with me, went to sleep under the arching branches of a tree. I have as little recollection of my next day's journey, except that I defined a diagonal, and thus avoided the bend. I found Herndon waiting in front of the tent, rather impatient for my arrival. 
               "Halloo, old fellow! "he shouted, jumping up at seeing me, "I was really getting scared about you. Where have you been? What have you seen? What are our chances? Have you had any adventures? killed any lions, or anything? By-the-by, I had a narrow escape with one yesterday. Capital shot; but prudence is the better part of valor, you know. But, really," he said again, apparently struck by my abstraction of manner, "what have you seen?" 
               "I have found the source of the Nile," I said, simply. 
               Is it not strange, that, when we have a great thing to say, we are always compelled to speak so simply in monosyllables syllables? Perhaps this, too, is an example of the law that continually reduces many to one,-the unity giving the substance of the plurality; but as the heroes of the "Iliad" were obliged to repeat the messages of the gods literatim, so we must say a great thing as it comes to us, by itself. It is curious to me now that I was not the least excited in announcing the discovery,-not because I did not feel the force of it, but because my mind was so filled, so to speak, so saturated, with the idea, that it was perfectly even with itself, though raised to an immensely higher level. In smaller minds an idea seizes upon one part of them, thus inequalizing it with the rest, and so, throwing them off their balance, they are literally deranged (or disarranged) with excitement. It was so with Herndon. For a minute he stared at me in stupefied astonishment, and then burst into a torrent of incoherent congratulations. 
               "Why, Zeitzer!" he cried, "you are the lucky man, after all. Why, your fortune's made,-you'll be the greatest man of the age. You must come to America; that is the place for appreciating such things. You'll have a Common-Council dinner in Boston, and a procession in New York. Your book will sell like wild-fire. You'll be a lion of the first magnitude. Just think! The Man who discovered the Source of the Nile!" 
               I stood bewildered, like one suddenly awakened from sleep. The unusual excitement in one generally so self-possessed and indifferent as my companion made me wonder sufficiently; but these allusions to my greatness, my prospects, completely astounded me. What had I done,-I who had been chosen, and led step by step, with little interference of my own, to this end? What did this talk of noise and clamorous notoriety mean? 
               "To think," Herndon ran on, "that you should have beaten me, after all! that you should have first seen, first drunk of, first bathed in--" 
               "Drunk of! bathed in!" I repeated, mechanically. "Herndon, are you crazy? Would I dare to profane the sacred fountain?" 
               He made no reply, unless a quizzical smile might be considered as such,-but drew me within the tent, out of hearing of the two Egyptians, and bade me give an account of my adventures. When I had finished,- 
               "This is grand!" he exclaimed. "Now, if you will share the benefits of this discovery with me, I will halve the cost of starting that steamboat I spoke of, and our plan will soon be afloat. I shouldn't wonder, now, if one might not, in order to start the town, get up some kind of a little summer-pavilion there, on the top of the mountain,-something on the plan of the Tip-Top House at Mount Washington, you know,-hang the stars and stripes off the roof, if you're not particular, and call it the Teuton-American. That would give you your rightful priority, you see. By the beard of the Prophet, as they say in Cairo, the thing would take!" 
               I laughed heartily at this idea, and tried, at first in jest, then earnestly, to make him understand I had no such plans in connection with my discovery; that I only wanted to extend the amount of knowledge in the world,-not the number of ice-cream pavilions. I offered to let him take the whole affair into his own hands,-cost, profit, and all. I wanted nothing to do with it. But he was too honest, as he thought, for that, and still talked and argued,-giving his most visionary plans a definite, tangible shape and substance by a certain process of metallicizing, until they had not merely elbowed away the last shadow of doubt, but had effectually taken possession of the whole ground, and seemed to be the only consequences possible upon such a discovery. My dislike to personal traffic in the sublimities of truth began to waver. I felt keenly the force of the argument which Herndon used repeatedly, that, if I did not thus claim the monopoly, (he talked almost as if I had invented something,) some one else would, and so injustice be added to what I had termed vulgarity. I felt that I must prevent injustice, at least. Besides, what should I have to show for all my trouble, (ah! little had I thought of "I" or my trouble a short time ago!)-what should I have gained, after all,-nay, what would there be gained for any one,-if I merely announced my discovery, without--starting the steamboat? And though I did feebly query whether I should be equally bound to establish a communication, with pecuniary emolument, to the North Pole, in case I discovered that, his remark, that this was the Nile, and had nothing to do with the North Pole, was so forcible and pertinent, that I felt ashamed of my suggestion; and upon second thought, that idea of the dinner and procession really had a good deal in it. I had been in New York, and knew the length of Broadway; and at the recollection felt flattered by the thought of being conveyed in an open chariot drawn by four or even eight horses, with nodding plumes, (literal ones for the horses,-only metaphorical ones for me,) past those stately buildings fluttering with handkerchiefs, and through streets black with people thronging, to see the man who had solved the riddle of Africa. And then it would be pleasant, too, to make a neat little speech to the Common Council,-letting the brave show catch its own tail in its mouth, by proving that, if America did not achieve everything, she could appreciate-yes, appreciate was the word-those who did. Yes, this would be a fitting consummation; I would do it. 
               But, ah! how dim became the vision of that quiet lake on the summit of the mountain! How that vivid lightning-revelation faded into obscurity! Was Pharaoh again ascending his fatal chariot? 
               The next day we started for the ascent. We determined to follow the course of the river backwards around the bend, and set out from my former starting-point, as any other course might lead us into a hopeless dilemma. We had no difficulty in finding the sandy plain, and soon reached landmarks which I was sure were on the right road; but a tramp of six or eight hours-still in the road I had passed before-brought us no nearer to our goal. In short, we wandered three days in that desert, utterly in vain. My heart sunk within me at every failure; with sickening anxiety I scanned the horizon at every point, but nothing was visible but stunted bushes and white pebbles glistening in the glaring sand. 
               The fourth day came,-and Herndon at last stopped short, and said, in his steady, immobile voice,- 
               "Zeitzer, you must have made this grand discovery in your dreams. There is no Nile up this way,-and our water-skins are almost dry. We had better return and follow up the course of the river where we left it. If we again fail, I shall return to Egypt to carry out my plan for converting the Pyramids into ice-houses. They are excellently well adapted for the purpose, and in that country a good supply of ice is a desideratum. Indeed, if my plan meets with half the success it deserves, the antiquaries two centuries hence will conclude that ice was the original use of those structures. 
               "Shade of Cheops, forbid! "I exclaimed. 
               "Cheops be hanged!" returned my irreverent companion. "The world suffers too much now from overcrowded population to permit a man to claim standing-room three thousand years after his death,-especially when the claim is for some acres apiece, as in the case of these pyramid-builders. Will you go back with me?" 
               I declined for various reasons, not all very clear even to myself; but I was convinced that his peculiar enticements were the cause of our failure, and I hated him unreasonably for it. I longed to get rid of him, and of his influence over me. Fool that I was! I was the sinner, and not he; for he could not see, because he was born blind, while I fell with my eyes open. I still held on to the vague hope, that, were I alone, I might again find that mysterious lake; for I knew I had not dreamed. So we parted. 
               But we two (my servant and I) were not left long alone in the Desert. The next day a party of natives surprised us, and, after some desperate fighting, we were taken prisoners, sold as slaves from tribe to tribe into the interior, and at length fell into the hands of some traders on the western coast, who gave us our freedom. Unwilling, however, to return home without some definite success, I made several voyages in a merchant-vessel. But I was born for one purpose; failing in that, I had nothing further to live for. The core of my life was touched at that fatal river, and a subtile disease has eaten it out till nothing but the rind is left. A wave, gathering to the full its mighty strength, had upreared itself for a moment majestically above its fellows,-falling, its scattered spray can only impotently sprinkle the dull, dreary shore. Broken and nerveless, I can only wait the lifting of the curtain, quietly wondering if a failure be always irretrievable,-if a prize once lost can never again be found. 
             
             
                
               II. MY THREE CONVERSATIONS WITH MISS CHESTER. 
                
                  CHAPTER I. 
                  I WAS at a party; where, is none of your business, and immaterial to the following relation. On second thoughts, however, as localization increases the interest of a narrative, I will say, at New York, in a Fifth Avenue palace. 
                  Perhaps it would be well to say something introductory about myself. I was twenty-five-between you and me, fair reader, I am not so very much older now-tall, well-formed, strong and active, both mentally and physically, and an extensive and omnivorous reader and student. The only trait of my character which has any special significance, relatively to the matter in hand is, that I have a considerable endowment of that magnetic power used in throwing "sensitives," as they are technically termed, into the mesmeric state, although I very seldom exerted it, and my possession of it was known, I believe, only to myself. Did it never happen to you, respected reader, when looking intently into a person's eyes during conversation, that you saw the thought, and even the very words, which passed through his or her mind, in comment or reply? The whole group of phenomena, of which that is one-embracing some classes of dreams, much mental action, animal magnetism, biology, the whole circle, in fact, of physico-psychological science-is, at this present writing, the most profound, comprehensively, multitudinously ously and variously related, the most promising, important and intensely interesting, and the least understood, of all the departments of human knowledge. I wish I could stop to indicate a few of the complex and astonishingly intimate ramifications by which this philosophy-the philosophy of the combined and reciprocal interaction of mind and body, the wondrous march or border-territory whereon spirit and matter bear conflicting and contested sway-underlies and entwines itself with human interests and human actions. But that is not my present design; and for the narrator, especially, must hoc age be inscribed upon his pen. Mind this; not that, nor the other. 
                  The relevancy of these remarks consists in this, namely that the few circumstances which I propose to narrate are an actual exemplification of the working of the laws to whose existence and influence I have alluded. I have permission from the lady most interested to record and publish them; for, however insignificant in themselves, they will, at least, form some portion of the archives from which a future generation is certainly to draw facts cooperative in constructing a fabric of universal philosophy, more marvellous in architecture, and more immeasurably magnificent in dimensions, than any the wildest dream hitherto figured by the loftiest human intellect. This splendor, however, is of course. Systems of actual truth, the work of the All-powerful-as their awful vastness unveils itself before human eyes-must as much transcend the beauty and the size of the one-sided little elaborations of human minds, as the unimaginable splendors of evening clouds excel the blue and yellow dabs of that landscape-goat of a "paintaster," Skumble; as the great palaces of the heavens surpass the ecclesiological glories of the Wooden Gothic. 
                  I had selected, according to my custom, a corner, from which I was making my ordinary use of the company, viz.: studying their lives from their faces, and working the detail of expressions and postures into connection with the prexistent mass of mental philosophy, whose acquisition and arrangement had been my study for years. 
                  All the usual varieties of young men and women passed in review before the uninteresting person in the corner. I was not dressed in fine raiment, wore no gloves, was not known as a "lion;" known, indeed at all, to only two or three besides my cousin, the daughter of the house, and only very slightly known even to them and to her. So, nobody stopped to talk with me; and, as I had arranged with cousin Ellen to let me alone, save when I should ask to be introduced, I had a fair opportunity for my secret espials. It was a curious and entertaining spectacle, when rightly viewed. First, I generalized my eyesight-if the expression be allowable-and gazed upon the moving mass before me, without reference to any particular individual. This, especially during the dances, furnished a droll spectacle. Such another may be observed by gazing in the same general manner at a church, all waving with fans, like a flock of great butterflies over a bed of gay cabbages, on a hot Sunday in summer: and another, more decided in character, by observing the simultaneous nutations of heads, fingers, and arms in an orchestra. These effects are different from that of a band of marching men; for the entire body of these last moves forward by rhythmic progressions, while in the cases just instanced, the company considered together, is stationary; and the rhythmic movement of individual limbs and instruments throws only an atmosphere, as it were, of ordered motion over the whole. 
                  I threw out of consideration the bodies of the dancers, and only observed their heads. A strong volition of a few minutes' duration enabled me entirely to lose the remembrance of bodies, and to free myself from the sensations coming from the sound of the music; and so, from the silent motions of the dancers, and the accompanying expressions of the faces,-in quadrille dances especially,-there arose before me a spectacle of such intense absurdity that I was forced to break off my occupation to avoid an obtrusive laugh. I was beholding only faces, it will be remembered, as solely as if I had been looking at heads cut off. The expressions upon nearly all of them were of intense solemnity. Nearly upon a level, they bobbed up and down in couples and fours; swam about, cocking themselves oddly to one side or to the other; turned towards each other in the alternations of rest, and gibbered slightly; anon, launched forth again upon the inane vagaries of their solemn mummery, I nearly laughed aloud, but ceased gazing: and, forthwith, grew angry. Apish phantasms of silly sport, the winking, wiggling heads, were a fair representation of the earnestness with which the "first circles" bury themselves in the mindless frivolities of polite society. I was angry that the observances of fashion should be so much regarded, even by the brainless nobodies who gabbled and fluttered before me; and with a most expansive and ardent aspiration after the Apotheosis of Labor, I left the dancers to their aimless evolutions. 
                  Then I made a similar experiment upon the heterogeneous volume of sounds that arose from the social hubbub of the rooms. Not listening to any single voice, I regarded only the clacking, clattering rattle that flowed turbulently up from so many voices, mingled with the monotonous dance-music of the two German fiddlers, the harpist and pianist, who officiated as orchestra. The din was stunning. It was as if the English language had been torn into ragged angular scraps and fragments, and vociferated at the utmost possible speed, and entirely at random, by the whole company. Now and then a shrill laugh, or one or two connected words loudly articulated, jumped up from the rough average of the confused noise. The harsh fiddle-notes darted and streamed up and down among the tumult, like so many vocal squibs; and the harp and piano were scarcely audible. A minute or two of such listening satisfied me, and I returned to my invidious business of watching my neighbors. 
                  A flaxen-haired and flaxen-moustached dandy, whose unnaturally slender limbs, cased, secundum artem, in skintight pants, would almost qualify him for the workhouse under the vagrant laws, as "having no visible means of support," stood "diddling" (i. e. imitating the movements of a wretch in an ague-fit), after the approved fashion, and expending washy conversation and washier smiles upon a female counterpart. Two or three city damsels, very much alike, all having the fair complexions, slender forms and large fringed eyes, so common among metropolitan beauties,-were giggling and chattering, in the enjoyment of that fluent ladies' talk so incomprehensible and unattainable to us stupid and slow-tongued men. Two or three wizzled antiques of the same sex mumbled sourly together upon a sofa. Several fat mothers conversed in awful conclave, on the other side of the room; and in the middle, the varying dances wove their interminable tangle. 
                  With her back towards me, so near that I could almost hear her words, stood a tall young woman dressed in black, with magnificent shoulders and arms, with raven-black hair of great fineness, length and volume, and a dark but peculiarly transparent complexion. She was surrounded by several gentlemen, whom she seemed at no loss to entertain, at least so far as to bear her full share in the conversation, and in the commerce of wits, whatever they might be; for there seemed to be in the circle much laughter, though not of the pleasantest sort. As I watched the group, I saw one and another of the gentlemen's faces redden, when the others laughed; one or two grew preternaturally sober, and quietly left that part of the room. The lady's noble head, haughtily set upon her neck, moved now and then with an almost imperceptible gesture of disdain or anger. I quietly drew a little nearer; not to listen to the conversation, but to observe the heads. The faces of the men were all foolish and conceited; and they were, as it happened, all fair-haired. Although I could not see the lady's face, yet the dark masses of her hair and dress, and the height and volume of her head, her self-possessed attitude, the minute gesture of which I spoke, and the short and keen replies which she shot about, rendered the contrast of characters, as she stood among the young men, extreme and striking. 
                  She stood talking with her retinue for a considerable time; and afterwards with others who approached. I observed her steadily and intently, watching her head, her temperament, her form, and her demeanor. All were faultless; at least, even with a sufficiently critical disposition, and much experience in estimating phrenological, physiological, and psychological characteristics, I could not see anything to change. I did not, however, as I said, see the front of her head. I gazed and gazed, until I became absorbed in my contemplations; and in considering their consequent and collateral reflections, my meditations eventuated in a profound reverie of a dim and undefinable character. All my thoughts, at first, seemed centred upon the individual lady at whom I had been looking. But I lost track of them; and it seemed, afterwards, as if I had entered into a state resembling that which Asiatic ascetics believe they can attain by unending reiterations of their sacred name. 
                  I was aroused from entire forgetfulness of time and place, by some sudden and uncomfortable sensation, which made me for an instant suspect that I had been struck, although I could not say where. Upon this unceremonious recall of my fugitive wits, whatever its nature might be, I looked again at the fair object of my speculations; and with such a feeling as if I had not seen her for a long time. For the sudden change from abstracted reverie of intense contemplation, to mere ordinary intuition, was quite great enough to cause the requisite break in the current of my consciousness. The strange beauty, for some reason or other, was blushing deeply-at least it is improbable that so brilliant a color would incarnadine her neck, and not her cheeks and brow. Deeply she blushed for some unknown reason, and almost immediately she moved away, without turning her head, saying something which I could not hear, to a distant part of the room. 
                  I recurred to my cogitations upon the flitting figures before me, but still my thoughts recurred to the "dark ladye." I felt certain that she must be well worth acquaintance. It could hardly be possible that one evidently of so remarkable natural endowments, should not present a rare study for the philosopher-especially for the philosopher in living minds. I desired to complete my new discovery. My snug corner became dull. I left it; and edged and twisted about the lofty rooms, pretending great need to arrive at some point in advance, which, like the beetle with buttered horns, I carried forward as I went. Up and down I wormed about; sometimes looking earnestly at the other side of the room in general, sometimes peering with emphasis at a feigned something among the closely crowded male and female shoulders around me; until, after making a good deal of trouble, and many skilful evolutions, I unsuspectedly established myself to my satisfaction en chelon and to the front of my unknown. Thus, I was in better luck than before, in my philosophical pursuit. For while I was as well hidden from her as before, by the densely aggregated and moving mass of the crowd, a skilful adjustment of my operations would preserve me from annoying her, while I could study her face and gesture-language to much better advantage. 
                  Of her face, the lower half was perfect but not peculiar, unless for the firm closure of the full lips. The eyes were large, black, and deep-set. The eyebrows fell with an unusual slope at the outer end of the eye. The forehead rose high above, full and steep, like an intellectual man's forehead; and in those portions which would be its four angles, were it a parallelogram laid athwart the face, fuller than any I had ever observed. And in looking, again I glided into deep and concentrated musings; and again, from a state of profound reverie, I was aroused by such another shock as I had felt before. Again I gathered together my scattered thoughts; and as soon as I had retraced their lost clue up to the passing moment, again I looked towards the dark beauty who had so much attracted me. She had changed her position, and was looking another way; but again, whether from some casualty of conversation, or from having noticed my persistent gaze, she was blushing. 
                  Beginning, now, to be actuated by a desire to obtain by conversation the complement of the scanty knowledge with which mere exterior observation had supplied me, and thus to secure some satisfactory acquaintance with, one who, I did not doubt, possessed unusual gifts, I forthwith resorted to Cousin Ellen. From her I requested an introduction to my fair unknown; at the same time inquiring in general as to her name and condition. She was, Ellen said, a Miss Irene Chester; the daughter of a farmer in one of the small seaport towns of Fairfield county, Connecticut; an assistant teacher in one of the city schools; an old schoolmate of hers, cousin Ellen's; here in society for almost the first time, but already making quite a sensation; nicknamed "The Two-edged Sword," from the keenness of her repartees; always a strange girl; invited on the ground of the school-fellowship, having, I think, been Ellen's room-mate; perhaps not known at all in city society, beyond Ellen's immediate circle; of great conversational talent, a student, a reader, and otherwise accomplished. 
                  These last, namely, the study, reading, and accomplishments, a trifle unsettled me; for ladies with those recommendations usually gabble and dabble, but little else. Yet I took comfort from the omen of power in the nickname, and persisted. 
                  Miss Chester heard my name and the recital of my cousinship to the pretty hostess, with considerable frigidity; looked me clearly in the eye as I accosted her, and waited, apparently under the influence of some dislike or disinclination to speak, for me to begin. 
                  These cool receptions are very much more adapted to vivify one's anger than one's intellect. I burned in inward wrath and outward speechlessness, for a minute or so; then suddenly adopting a resolution, I drove away the rage, assumed as pretty a simper as I could muster, and ventured to remark, with an air of great interest and (I flatter myself) a well executed "diddle," 
                  "It's very fine weather, Miss Chester." 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  "Unusually crowded rooms this evening. How tiresome it is to be squeezed up among so many disagreeable, vulgar people!" 
                   
                  "Do you think so?" said she, with a sort of glimmer in her eye. "If it is so disagreeable, what made you come?" 
                  "Self-denial," answered I, "is healthy for the soul. And aside from that excellent reason"-here I rather exaggerated my simper and my diddle, to the young lady's evident disgust-"I must have had a presentiment of pleasure reserved for me, in the acquisition of so delightful an acquaintance as Miss Chester." I accompanied the last words with a culminating grin, and as silly a bow as I could contrive. 
                  "Are you acquainted with me?" she asked, with a curious observing expression of eye and of lip, as much as to say, "Behold here a new and strange variety of baboon." 
                  I sniggered after the most approved style, and answered with the fashionable euphuistic dialect, at which I could easily see that Miss Chester's disdain and anger were flaming almost unendurably, 
                  "He, he, he! Ah flattah meself that I am competent to elucidate and analyze charactahs at short notice. But you must be weary with standing so long. Pahmit me to wait Upon you to the tte--tte opposite; and if you will allow me, ah shall be exceedingly delighted to fahnish you a specimen of my powahs in that line." 
                  "By all means, sir," said Miss Chester. "I thank you." 
                  So we sat down. 
                  "I must make one preface," said I. "I presume that a young lady of Miss Chester's talents and information" (another disdain-provoking bow from me) "is aware that such observation as I have been able to make, cannot reveal what modifications circumstances and occupation may have engrafted upon your original character. Permit me, therefore, to ask that you will just tell me what and where your life has been." 
                  "Not one single syllable," returned she, with evident pleasure in a short refusal. "You pretended to an acquaintance with me, and offered to prove it. And now, when it comes to the trial, you already begin to feel about for such scraps and hints as you may hope to coax out of me, after the usual fashion of fortune-tellers. I thought it would be so. I don't believe you know yourself, and to pretend to know me, whom you never saw before, and probably never will again! How should you? And why should you?" 
                  "I know this, at least," said I, quietly, and dropping my baboonery, "that you are quite angry, and that you have acquired a sudden and immeasurable contempt for me. Is it not so?" 
                  "Yes," said she, promptly, and with inconsiderate but full sincerity; for she spoke in answer to all my conversation and manners, up to my last question. Then she started, and looking at me in hasty alarm, and reflecting what her answer had been, added, "No;" for she comprehended for the first time the indications afforded by the new tone of the query. 
                  "Hot and cold," I replied. "However, both answers are right. No matter for the apparent inconsistency. Deeper thinkers than either of us have decided that truth may oftentimes best be presented by the assertion of incompatible extremes." 
                  "I think you are correct," said Miss Chester, "but I don't know how you could tell. However, as to that notion about presenting truth, it behooves to be careful lest the poor creature perish between its two incompatible bundles of hay. Well, sir; now, if you will please commence the proof positive of acquaintance?" 
                   
                  "Yes." I scanned her face a moment, and added, "You do not like to attend church." 
                  "I do, too," she replied, hastily. "You are wrong there." 
                  "You are glad to think so," I said. "But think a moment. I do not mean that you dislike religious services. But does not very much of the church choir music displease you?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "And the prayers-were you never perplexed with a troublesome feeling that somehow they were not your prayers? 
                  "And the sermon-I am sure you have often shocked your friends by staying at home and reading one, when they were sure you ought to have been at church." 
                  "Pshaw!" said Miss Chester, "you found that out from Cousin Ellen." 
                  "Not at all. I stated the particular fact merely as one phase of a characteristic which ramifies into many manifestations. You are what is sometimes called 'original'-I mean slow of belief, and independent in reasoning. You examine doctrine and precept for yourself. The rapid statements of a sermon-of any oral discussion of a subject, do not satisfy you. You want to examine, to compare, to weigh. That accounts for your preferring to read sermons rather than to hear them. In general, you dislike lectures and public addresses, on whatever subjects; and in general, you prefer to read on them rather than to hear. As to the prayers, you are wrong to allow yourself in the feeling, though I am right in stating it to you. The dissatisfaction is owing to your defeat of sympathy, either with congregation or preacher. If you would abandon yourself to a generous participation in petitions which are only such as universal petitions must of necessity be, you would reap good from the prayer. The music, not to speak of its usual wretched execution, is unpleasant to you, as a dishonest pretence of praise, offered usually by the irreligious and profane lips of persons who chant hymns to God, not because hymns overflow from hearts full of love, but because in their individual cases, the laryngeal membranes and tissues possess unusual motive and vibratory power. You see that my observations are merely individual corollaries from the premises of honesty, good observing and reflecting faculties, and musical temperament." 
                  "It appears, then," said Miss Chester, "that your acquaintance is one not of very long standing, and hypothetical and extemporaneous to an extreme." 
                  "But have I not spoken truly?" 
                  "Yes, I believe so," said she, "although the things you say are such, as for some reason or other had not been articulately presented to me exactly in that way. I hardly knew them, if at all. And what is more," she added, with a troubled look, "I do not like to be so easily read. I had thought myself safe in unintelligibility." 
                  "While," I rejoined, "you fancied that nobody else had got beyond 'baker' and 'shady.'" 
                  "Excuse the long word. I will plead the privilege of my pedagogy for that, though. But as to your discoveries; I see that things which I certainly never told to anybody, are known outside of my own mind. The more I think of it, the less I like it." 
                  "But you should not dislike truth," I said. 
                  "The truth is not to be spoken at all times. Nor is it always best or necessary to have it known, even." 
                  "Perhaps not," I answered. "But I will proceed with my analysis." 
                  "No," said Miss Chester, hastily. "You have said enough already. I--You--" 
                   
                  "One single remark let me make, however," I answered, and I now looked steadily into eyes that did not endure my gaze. "Just one thing. You do not despise me any longer. And you are half afraid of me, and the rest, I fear, is dislike." 
                  "I won't tell you anything about it," she replied, with an alarmed sharpness. 
                  "Very well; quite as well," I rejoined. "A good observer is like a good arithmetician. He proves his work as he goes along; he does not need to look for 'the answer in the book.' But let me ask you if you play chess?" 
                  "I do. Not much; but I am very fond of it." 
                  "Will you give me leave to come and play a game with you?" I asked. 
                  I had permission; and thus our conversation ended for the evening. 
                  It is no part of the design of this plain statement of facts, to produce any dramatic surprises. So I will plainly say, that by this time I was exceedingly delighted with my new acquaintance, and, indeed, to all intents and purposes, thoroughly and suddenly "in love at first sight." 
                  But as to the nature of her opinions, in regard to me, except for the brief synopsis which I had mentioned to herself, and which, also I was confident of, in respect to my estimate of their kind, but not of their degree, I could form no guess. But respect is much. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER SECOND. 
                  MISS CHESTER, in truth, was almost my ideal, in point of personal attractions; namely, the embodiment of health and strength, under the lovely feminine limitations imposed by the laws and graceful lines of womanly beauty; and I felt a certainty which long observation and study in psychology and physiology might justify, that her mind was worthy even of a nobler casket, if such a one were imaginable. The fine hair, so inscrutably dark; the deep liquid eyes, whose unfathomable irises seemed, as I gazed into them, overflowing as redundant fountains into the clear white eyeballs; the dark and clear transparency of skin, demonstrated (a rare conjunction) quickness and endurance, not bodily only, but intellectual. The great volume of the head, the noble lofty forehead, the height of the upper cerebral region, proved as surely her intellectual excellence; which, in such a character as hers, must have been sustained and developed by the severe discipline of her work as a teacher. For, although the fact is seldom recognised, and indeed little known, no occupation on earth furnishes so comprehensive, invigorating, and symmetrical an exercise for the maturing, or matured mind, as the quiet and neglected business of "teaching school." And although disagreeable conclusions might seem suggested by the sharp words which I was certain she had distributed plentifully to the amiable youths, my predecessors in conversation, of which she had given me a specimen or two, and of which the surname she had acquired might be reckoned a boding omen, yet they pleased me. For the wretched dandies richly deserved them. And how natural was it, for a strong and clear mind like hers, full of noble thoughts, and the power to live them out, to be kindled into sparkling and blazing anger at the witless drivel of the butterflies she crushed! Moreover, I remembered with keen delight, how the wrathful contempt which my simulated folly had provoked, faded out forthwith, as soon as I spoke true and clear thoughts to her; how her maiden pride, so pardonably and beautifully fully lofty and outspoken, when she felt that her interlocutors dwelt in a sphere far below her-when she flashed lightnings of scorn down upon their puny heads from the ethereal air of her own inaccessible and uninvaded realm of thought-had fled, abashed; how with truthful and maidenly honesty infinitely more lovely than her beautiful anger, and which was the basis, to me reflecting upon it, of deep delicious musings, she had recognised in me an intelligence honest and like her own, in kind at least, even if (which I never doubted) her womanhood had clothed her with the great womanly prerogatives of deeper intuitions and more unfathomable enthusiasms. And that she was a true woman still, and not a mannish unsexed truant from her right life-limits, I knew; first, because I had seen so plainly-and I revelled in the remembrance, not from selfish pride of power, but because the fact vindicated to myself a claim of near relationship to such a noble soul-because I had seen so plainly how she consented to respect my masculine prerogative of self-confident and aggressive intellection; and, second, because it was only with such instinctive frankness, and with such sweet and close-following recoil into reluctance, that she recognised my bold appeals to her own interior consciousness-my sudden invasion of her own realms of silent thought-where she had before sat, sole empress, 
                        "In maiden meditation, fancy free."
                     
                   
                  Such thoughts burdened me in daily dreams; and the current of my studious life, before flowing steadily on in reading and thought, now spread itself out in wide, quiet expanses of reverie; reflecting infinities of sweet thoughts, but flowing onward no more. I was "deeper than ever plummet sounded," in (I flattered myself) a reasonable, noble, and beautiful love. 
                   
                  After two or three fruitless calls, made, to my great disgust, when Miss Chester happened to be out of town, or otherwise employed away from home, I succeeded in finding her at leisure for the chess game which she had promised me. 
                  I was shown, that evening, into a well-furnished parlor; and in a few minutes Miss Chester entered, dressed, as usual, in black. She greeted me as if I had been an old acquaintance. 
                  "Yes," said I, "that is right. We are acquainted, are we not? In fact, old friends?" 
                  "In some sense," she replied, "it certainly does seem as if I had known you a long time; or rather, as if you had known me a long time, for I don't feel as well acquainted with you as you do with me. You read thoughts with an ease which frightens me." 
                  "Where the fountain is so clear," I said, "it is no wonder that its depths are searched. Turbid and muddy thoughts would have shamed your mind into a cloudy secretive fear. But that would have revealed its own story, too." 
                  "I believe," said Miss Chester, "that I won't talk any more mental philosophy with you. But here is our battlefield. I suppose I might as well surrender without a summons, if it were not for the shame. So I challenge you to the course with sharpened spears, as Ivanhoe did his wicked enemy, Brian de Bois Guilbert." 
                  "I accept the challenge, but not in the spirit of De Bois Guilbert. And in token that I bear you no ill-will, I offer you the right hand of a foeman's friendship." 
                  She hesitated almost imperceptibly, but took the offered hand with a smile. I had offered her mine, indeed, that I might touch hers again, and I think some conscious or unconscious perception of it withheld hers. 
                   
                  "Now, then," said I as I held her hand a moment, let it go, sat down by the table, emptied the chessmen upon the board, and quoted with assumed ferocity, "Death to the Huguenot! Fagot and Flame!" 
                  Miss Chester replied promptly. 
                  "But the braggart retreated more sad than he came. There's a Roland for your Oliver, sir. Still, your random shot told, for my mother was of a Huguenot family from the south of France, which came over to this country about 1690, and settled near New York, when John Jay's ancestors and so many more good men and women fled out of France to escape the dragonnades." 
                  "Indeed? But now please tell me where you found the quotation with which you answered mine?" 
                  "If I can remember, certainly. And where did you get yours?" 
                  I reflected a moment. "It is mere 'flotsam,' I suspect-a splinter from some half-read poem, floating among miscellaneous dbris of hurried reading. I declare I can't locate it. Stay, I'll tell you. No." And I had to give it up. 
                  "I'm not so honest as you," said Miss Chester. "I have tinkered my line-it is a sort of transfer from Walter Scott's 'Search after Happiness.' The last two lines, you know, are- 
                         
                           "'And the king, disappointed, in sorrow and shame 
                           Went back to Serendib as sad as he came.' 
                        
                     
                   
                  "I think I caught it by the jingle at the end, as one might a rattlesnake by the tell-tale. Excuse the pun, please. The requisite alteration I extemporized." 
                  By this time the battle was ranged; Miss Chester, by lady's privilege, having the white pieces, and I the bloody red. 
                   
                  I invited her to the attack with as much politeness as did the Colonel of the English household troops his French adversaries at Fontenoy, and with more literature; for I challenged again in verse- 
                        "Charge, Chester, charge."
                     
                   
                  "For shame!" exclaimed my fair foe, laughing, however, "to pervert and parody right and left in that way! I fear you don't reverence anything, sacred or profane. I won't begin, now, unless the lot shall decide it so." 
                  By lot the first move fell to me. 
                  "I don't know," said I, scanning Miss Chester's face, "whether to attack you in an ordinary or an extraordinary manner. Let me consider. You like ghost stories. I shouldn't wonder if you specially enjoyed Poe's marvellous imagination, 'The Fall of the House of Usher.'" 
                  She laughed. "You are right, I declare. Do you?" 
                  "I do, indeed. So, seeing that you take such delight in things 'strange and vague,' I will treat you to a chess opening of that precise description." 
                  And I moved, king's knight's pawn one. 
                  In giving a cursory account of the progress of the game, I cannot of course expect to make myself understood in detail by untechnical readers. But the game of chess is one whose combinations and varying fortunes can perhaps be more readily represented by illustrative phrases drawn from the language pertaining to departments of life and action not merely lusory, than any other transaction so insignificant as a sedentary amusement. I shall therefore pause a little for an explanatory excursus.
                   
                  The main series of evolutions of a game of chess may very aptly be narrated in phrases applicable to a military campaign. There is the same set of material conditions; namely, an area for combat, invasive and defensive; a given force, to command; main points of attack and defence; centres of operations; and necessity for intricately adjusted combinations of effort, for in both cases each separate corps or soldier must subserve some leading purposes, immediate or remote, or both, and must also strengthen his neighbors without impeding them. The strife is decided by the same conditions in the opponents, viz., equality or inequality of force, or of skill, or of both, and the same qualities of mind are required; clearness of perception, longanimity, boldness, decision and perseverance. 
                  Having premised thus much, I may more intelligibly proceed to state that the move with which I commenced my game was the first step of a plan of campaign like that of Fabius the Delayer; a movement designedly insignificant, upon my own flank, designed to induce the enemy to deploy rapidly and unwisely, and so to lay her positions open to some deadly attack when the game should be in mid career. I intended to hold my centre troops close around my king, and to carry on my attack and defence from the sides of the game, allowing my opponent what is usually supposed the decisive advantage of occupying all the central open field, as the sly old Roman I mentioned, "who lurked and wandered in the bailiwicks" of Apulia and of Latium, lying close among the hills, watching Hannibal and waiting for chances to annoy him. 
                  The game progressed as I expected; and in truth much more so, too. For Miss Chester's forces had been manuvred more skilfully than I had presumed upon; indeed she was the only lady player I ever saw who marshalled the mimic ranks with a man-like and purposeful decision and force of combinations. My plan, like an illogical argument, seemed likely to develop itself only to its own confusion. My deceitful Fabian policy, allowing my opponent time and space to construct an impregnable array, had cramped up my own hosts within a space so limited as to prevent me from developing their power anywhither. It seemed likely that (in a "chess point of view") I should be slain helpless and motionless, like a rat in a hole. 
                  But it was not merely the difficulty of my chosen course of play, either, that prevented the operation of my combinations. I had been struggling hard to confine my attention wholly to my game; for, as a good player and a genuine lover of chess, I abhorred to be beaten. My sexual pride, moreover, revolted, in spite of philosophy, against being beaten by a woman, and I experienced much repugnance, also, at the prospect of sharing the undesirable sensations of that disingenuous machinator commemorated by Shakespeare as affording special delight to beholders- 
                         
                           --"The knavish engineer 
                           Hoist by his own petard." 
                        
                      Therefore I strove to centre my mental powers upon the analytical and mnemonic operations mainly valuable in chess. But, for the first time, I could not do it. At one move after another, I caught myself gazing at Miss Chester, instead of at the pieces, and my thoughts intensely occupied in retracing the occurrences of the evening when I first met her. The violent efforts I made to discontinue this irrelevant occupation, must themselves of course have used much of the power which I could otherwise have bestowed on my game; and their ill-success, again, left more and more of their power to expend itself upon unreasonable and absurd reverie. But so it was, and I could not prevent it. The time which I should have occupied-which Miss Chester did occupy-in planning and combining bining, I used in gazing at her, as she leaned in steady study over the table; in gazing, not merely with the close attention to curves and forms which, nevertheless, artistic knowledge and experience did cause me to use; but with that mere rapture of contemplation with which we look at what is grand and perfectly magnificent, even to the satisfaction of our ideal of perfection. She nearly surprised me at it, once or twice. I escaped by quickly dropping my eyes, not altogether ingenuously, I fear, upon the board. Nor, had she been disposed to critical observation, could the fact have escaped her that something prepossessed me. For not only did such evasions cause my cheeks to tingle, but they were followed by particularly asinine proceedings in my conduct of the game. For, having wasted the minutes which should have found me a strong move, in dreams, I then, ashamed of further delay, moved not only unpreparedly, but with the additional blindness of embarrassment and anger. 
                  We had played without remark, Miss Chester studiously, and I morosely or abstractedly, for nearly an hour. It was only the slow development consequent upon the line of play which I had adopted, which kept me from being checkmated before. But at last I thought that I discovered the inevitable impendency of checkmate in five moves. I waited to study the position fairly, and instead of that, fell off into unseasonable and profound meditation. I can hardly assert that I was precisely in the voluntary exercise of my ordinary mental faculties, such was the extreme of my abstraction. At least I quite forgot, for the time being, my place and my occupation, in dreams of delightful memory, and delightful though groundless, vaticination. But these were suddenly shattered into destruction by a spasm or blow which vibrated in some mysterious way through all the chambers of my being. I looked up, and was astounded. Miss Chester stood erect before me, her large eyes dilated, and her breast heaving with anger and fear; and the red blood crimsoning her fair face, her fair neck, into a deep blush. 
                  "How dare you," said she, rapidly and angrily, "use such a power over me? This is the third time that--. But you may understand that even if you have it, you can never subject me to it. Did you not understand that the will of your subject must be subdued, or surrendered? If I were not able and willing to defy all you can do, I promise you I would have left you without a word. So often-in my own home, too!" 
                  In utter extremity of surprise, I too arose. She had spoken as if profoundly convinced of some pernicious attempt designedly made by me; but what her precise belief could be, I wondered, and had to answer nearly at random. 
                  "Would you believe me," I asked, "under any sanction?" 
                  She replied hesitatingly, "I don't know--" 
                  "I swear to you," I said, "before God, that I never entertained the most distant wish or purpose in respect to you, which could displease, or should displease the proudest or noblest woman." 
                  She stood yet hesitant in angry beauty. Even where truth is intellectually believed, it is often not felt until some corroboratory circumstance be furnished. 
                  "You know it is so," I added, earnestly; "I know you saw how unexpected your words were to me." 
                  "I did;" she answered. "I saw it. I believe you. But it was natural, you know, to be indignant." 
                  "But I don't know, either," I replied. "There is something here which I don't half understand, and you must let me talk with you about it. Let me lead you to the sofa." 
                   
                  She sat down, and I sat unrebuked near her. "What do you mean," I continued, "by speaking of the 'third time?'" 
                  "You know," she answered, half suspiciously, as if thinking that I pretended ignorance. 
                  "I think I partly do; but I want to be certain." 
                  "Don't you recollect," said Miss Chester, "that you treated me in the same way, twice, the other evening; and before you had spoken to me, too?" 
                  "I remember well," said I, "being twice surprised myself, by some one striking me a severe blow, as I supposed. And I acknowledge that I looked much and often at you. But, to-night, it must have been your anger, I think, that struck me. At least, I saw that you were angry. I say struck. But it was not a blow. It was something like a spasm; or, indeed, not that either; a sudden and powerful repellent force exerted upon me, and operating, it seems to me, now that I consider it, neither on my body nor my mind. But I don't understand it at all; although I confess to you--. But tell me, please, what was the sensation that you experienced? For it seems to me that you have been agitated much more than I." 
                  "You magnetized me," said she; "or tried to. Don't you know what that is?" 
                  "Yes. I know what that is, perfectly well. I know that I have some power of that kind. But I have never met with any phenomenon like these which seemed to have occurred in respect to you, and certainly have appeared in respect to myself. Please tell me plainly all about it. For there are, I think, many things which I can learn from you; and I shall be right glad to learn." 
                  I spoke with two meanings; if, indeed, I needed any instruction in the love-lesson which I was intuitively learning from my beautiful companion. Whether she saw both of them I do not know. But she blushed as she answered, 
                  "I will tell you just what happened to me. You know what the sensation is which indicates the coming of psycho-magnetic power from some person other than one's self?" 
                  "No, indeed," I replied; "that is, unless these three curious, sudden rebuffs, if I might call them so, which I have felt lately, were such. In truth, I have perhaps an unreasonably keen horror of coming under any such influence. I have often thought, that if I should find any person 'magnetizing' me, I would kill him, as surely as if it were necessary to prevent him from cutting my throat." 
                  "Yes. Then you can understand," said she; "how justifiably I was displeased when I found you trying to magnetize me." 
                  "Don't you believe me yet?" I asked. "I do most solemnly assure you that I had not the remotest intention of the kind. If I did it, it was entirely and most innocently involuntary." 
                  "Do you mean to say," returned Miss Chester, now apparently much surprised, but incredulously, "that you did not undertake to put my volition into a state of subjection to your own, either this evening or the other?" 
                  "Most assuredly I do," I answered. "Did I not tell you so before? I never used any such power at all, except to relieve one feeble person from a headache." 
                  So speaking, I grew angry. For now, for the first time, I understood what was the suspicion that Miss Chester entertained of me, viz.: that I had endeavored to make myself master of her will, by taking advantage of her susceptible nervous temperament So I myself now spoke further; and disdainfully and wrathfully. 
                  "And since you yet think that I proposed so vile and devilishly wicked a snare as to rob a woman of the control of her own spirit, I do well to be angry. I will not even deny the base accusation. Believe it if you can. And good-by to you. For I denied it, and truly, before. Neither shall any one have the opportunity of disbelieving me twice, if I can prevent it." 
                  So I was departing in haste, and in bitter anger and disappointment-anger at being so unworthily suspected-disappointment at the death of wild baseless hopes, unjustified, and, truly, almost unborn. 
                  But she saw then-her feminine instinct admonished her-that I spoke in most entire truthfulness. And she recalled me, saying, "Don't go. I believe you now, most fully. I did not understand you before, or I should have believed you before." 
                  And when, in my overpowering and deaf wrath, I strode unlistening into the hall, and was departing in speed, like a true and kind friend, she stopped me. For she stepped promptly between me and the door; and as I lifted my angry eyes upon her, hardly seeing anything, indeed, through the turbid tumults of unendurable passion that raged within me, she laid her fair hand upon my arm, and detained me with gentle force. And she lifted her clear eyes to mine, and looked upon me with such grieved and deep surprise, that I was abashed and ashamed to appear before one so pure in such unlovely fury. 
                  "You must not go away so angry. Come back. I will tell you a good reason for my suspicion. You positively shall not go away so unjustly angry at me." 
                  "Miss Chester," I replied, in shame as sudden as my wrath had been, "I will stop, if you will promise to forgive my foolish passion." 
                  "Yes, certainly." Then, seeing that I was disposed to reduplicate apologies, she continued; "Don't say a word about it. We don't, either of us, I believe, quite understand stand the other, yet. But when I have told you what I wish, you may depart, if you will, either to return or not. I do not expect to retain friends long." 
                  She spoke sadly. Nor was her sadness needed to induce me to remain, for my own displeasure was born of sorrow. So we sat down again. 
                  "The reason of which I spoke," she said, "is simply this. I have before this time narrowly escaped from one who sought to exercise over me the power which I supposed you were seeding to use. I am sure I need not justify myself any further?" 
                  "No, indeed," I answered. "But why did you speak of not retaining friends for any long time?" 
                  "Because I never sought to. I cannot expect fuller measure of liking than such as I have meted out to others." 
                  I could not deny the justice of the retribution. I made no answer, and there was a short pause. Then, recollecting a former part of our conversation, I asked again for an account of her own sensations at the time when she had supposed me attempting to bring her under a magnetic subjection to my will. 
                  "I doubt very much," said she, "whether the words exist for describing it. For several years I have read and talked much on this new philosophy of the mind and soul; but all the terms are vague, transferred from former uses into the present one; unsuitable, they fit like an empty crabshell to an oyster. So I can hardly tell you what it is. It begins, however, with a sensation which I can hardly describe, as I said, as to its precise nature-a general consciousness of relations or sympathies offered or obtruded from outside of one's own being; and this consciousness of mere relation proceeds and intensifies and individualizes, until the threads or web of the medium of connection weave thicker and thicker, and gather up into a cord passing directly to the person acting; and then that person becomes recognised as so acting. I don't mean that there is any actual cord, or material, or traceable road or way opened between the parties. I use the expression as the best practicable mode of representing the train of sensations. One thing more will finish all I can tell. You remember that story of Heinrich Zschokke, in which the somnambulic lady recognises so disgustfully the gross animalized character of the Italian prince, her wooer?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "The story is truthful there. There has always been, when I have felt the sensations I describe, an almost immediate revelation of that kind. It has seemed to me, though I must use words in the same vague representative sense again, that those who approached me in that way were unhumanized into beasts. Their personality seemed to change and degrade. Their souls departed. The force of their life was a mere animal efflux, first imperceptibly alloying the stream of influence which they rayed forth, but rapidly predominating until I was inexpressibly shocked by the consciousness of the innate brutality of such minds. I don't think I can state the experiences more intelligibly, though I have spent much time in meditating on them. I almost doubt whether, in the present state of scientific nomenclature and research, the conditions for the classification of this department of knowledge exist." 
                  Miss Chester ceased. "Allow me," said I, after a little thought, "to ask you a supplementary question or two. Was it not the bestial grossness of the powers, which you felt, which aroused in you the resisting horror of spasmodic volition, which freed you at once from the vile influence?" 
                   
                  "Yes," she replied; "I feel sure that it was." Then I asked, once more, with many doubts, and a most painful sinking of the heart, like that which assails a rash leaper, who doubts for an instant, in mid air, whether he shall reach the other side of the chasm-for I staked an unmeasurable hope or sorrow upon the chance of the single question-almost desperately I asked, although I was certain that I had looked and longed in pure freedom from any low desire-"Are you sure that it was that same disagreeable surprise and disgust which caused you to recalcitrate so violently against the influences which seem to have gone from me to you?" 
                  "I cannot be quite sure," returned Miss Chester. "I repel every approach of the kind as soon as I can distinguish the individual making it. And I now undergo so painful an agitation when I become aware that I am within such a sphere-such a keen apprehension of dangerous neighborhood, and so quick an anger-that I no longer stop to analyze the elements of whose operation I am conscious. But," she added, looking to the further side of the room, "I do most fully believe that the thing happened without ill-intention on your part. Is not that enough?" 
                  "Perhaps so, if it is all you can say." 
                  Then a thought occurred to me, that I would contrive to have this test applied; for I cared for no risk. I would know, if I were unconsciously impure, that it was so; and purify myself. I did not for a moment doubt the reliability of this strange insight, and I continued- 
                  "But I want leave to visit you again, and to read you one passage from a favorite author of mine, which I am sure you will like. And, in return, I shall ask you for some music." 
                  "But I have not told you that I could play. You have found it out by some queer method, I am sure. What was it?" 
                  "I observed, as you drummed upon the table, that you played triplets and thirds with your left hand; and only a pianist or organist would do that." 
                  "It is right," said she. "I will furnish such music as I can." 
                  I was so bold as to ask her to set a time for my next visit, which she did; and I was about departing, when she reminded me that our game of chess was yet unfinished. I hastily assured her that my interest in that game had altogether disappeared, when I had discovered the five-move mate; that I "resigned the game," and challenged her to another, at the first convenient opportunity. And so I departed. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER III. 
                  NOW ought I to apologize for the unreflecting and imprudent manner in which I had so suddenly become enamored? With one whom I had seen twice only; of whose character, abilities, cultivation, I had had but the most transient opportunities of judging? Perhaps so. The thoughts, however, which passed through my mind while I sat in my quiet little room, and meditated upon Miss Chester, my acquaintance with her, and its future, if any apology be needed or admissible, must supply it. I reflected, therefore, somewhat as follows:- 
                  Gloriously beautiful: That I can see-I, who am wont to be fastidious, even to the implication of affectation. Physically strong and healthy: The easy grace of motion, the pure complexion, the perfect outlines, assure me of that. Intellectually, even my ideal-mine, the hypercritical, the dreamer. For the scope of her thoughts, their direction and combination, even in little things, were such as those in which I had specially and most lovingly practised myself. Morally-how admirable to me-sickened with the lean righteousness of business honor, the undistinguishable righteousness of churches choking with worldly weeds, the utter non-righteousness of politicians and editors inconceivably soulless, soaked and seasoned in foulest falsehood until their original flavor, not in itself the most delicate, had disappeared under the gross superimposition of "practical life"-to me, wearied and sickened with such, how bright and noble her unrestrained, flashing sarcasm, her steady, flaming anger, against little men! Was it not even superfluously demonstrated that in reading, in study, in thought, word and work, we might be true and helpful yokefellows? Desiring things noble and true, and working for them? And that she would be truly a help-not in the assumption to herself of daily drudgeries, and in details and the freeing me therefrom (for how pleasant to shoulder my proper moiety of such burdens!); but in thinking with parallel and coqual vigor, in the same field of thought; in writing, talking, studying, the same pursuit. What a limitless dream of true union and interfusion of spirits! 
                  But, a prudent elder might object, I didn't know it; I was merely hypothetizing. That merely means that my methods of observing men and women, my rules for managing my inductions, my synthesis and analysis, are at fault. But as long as my experiments do not deceive me, I shall (mei enim unius vel maxim interest) rely upon them, in preference to the chilly vaticinations of an unfortunate senior, whose own faithlessness has wrought its like, most probably in those with whom he dealt, and so governed his opinions of them all. Moreover, I was arrogant or wild enough to believe, within my secret soul, that the instinctive delight, and the new and strange tumults antithetically stirred within me by this troublous Irene, this war-arousing Peace, were alone premises amply justificatory of my delicious conclusion. And it must and shall be so, if indeed she will embark with me-I would chant to her, despite the cold old man, as beseechingly as did the damsel to Thalaba the Destroyer:- 
                         
                           "The morn is young, the sun is fair; 
                           And pleasantly, through pleasant banks 
                           The quiet stream flows on- 
                           Wilt thou embark with me? 
                           Thou knowest not the watery way- 
                           Though day is fair, yet night must come- 
                           Dar'st thou embark with me? 
                           Through fearful perils thou may'st pass- 
                           Thou wilt embark with me?" 
                        
                     
                   
                  When I shall speak so to her, with the loving assurance of the last words, assuming, and so in part, at least, shaping, the desired reply, shall I not have it? 
                  I think, yes. 
                  Such meditations must suffice for apology. I sought out a curious old volume which I had found at a bookstall-the only bibliographical treasure in my possession. For it was from this book that I desired to read a passage to Miss Chester-a quaint and musical chapter, hidden among the mystical musings of the nameless old German author. Nameless, for title-page and colophon were both gone, and my bibliographic lore did not suffice me to discover the writer. 
                  What Miss Chester would say, or how she would receive the doctrine of the coverless old book, I doubted. However, I went, at the appointed time, and found her, as per agreement. I talked a few minutes, abstractedly and unconnectedly, upon indifferent matters; but not, of course, with any remarkable success. Then we spoke of Heinrich Zschokke, and his marvellous power of imagination; of his story of the Sleep-walker; and suddenly I remembered Miss Chester's former reference to Hortensia's recognition of the vile nature of the Italian nobleman, and further, of her careful avoidance to tell me whether she had actually recognised such in myself. And also, something suggested to me to contrive, now, to know fully what she could discover on that subject. Without pausing to reconsider, I spoke- 
                  "Miss Chester, do you remember saying that you were entirely sure of your ability to resist magnetic forces from other persons?" 
                  "I am, at any rate; although I do not remember saying so. Why?" 
                  "Because, I desire leave of you to test the justice of a suspicion which you entertain of me." 
                  "I don't understand. Test it how?" 
                  "In this way:" and I hurried on with my request, lest my courage should fail me, or lest any pause should admit a blank denial. "Let me dream of you as I did before, at the times when you felt it; and permit the magnetic power to be intensified as far as you dare allow. But, meanwhile, look keenly; and consider closely, whether in me you observe the abominable degradation which I see that you believe implied in the possession of the psychical authority. I would not ask so, much of you, without a valid reason, either. I have the right, now, so far as I can use it, without risk to you, to relieve myself from a suspicion which I know is unfounded. I fell under it without intention or wish. Do me the justice to allow me the only practicable chance of defence; in which, moreover over, the evidence is to be submitted to the accuser, and the verdict to come from the same. I never asked to rebut a suspicion before. But I never dreamed that I could fall under such a one, or that it could be entertained of me by one so pure as you." 
                  She sat, blushing, with eyes cast down; sighed; looked at me as if about to speak; hesitated; looked away upon the floor; at last, spoke. 
                  "I wish you would not insist; and, honestly, because I dread to have that which I only suppose, now, changed into a wretched certainty. But if you do insist, I think I ought to grant you the trial." 
                  "I do, indeed," I answered. "For I know what I am." 
                  "You must not ask me to look at you, however. That would originate a most unpleasant self-consciousness. I will read, and you may exercise your privilege without looking at my face." 
                  She took up the old book I had brought, and opened it. I sat still, thinking of myself, and of her. I knew that my soul was as pure as her own. I would vindicate before her my unsullied honor. It should appear to her that there might be another soul, not merely competent to consort with her own in light accomplishments, in intellectual labor, in social pleasure, but able moreover to ride as triumphantly as her own in the pure heaven of sunlighted and tranquil contemplations, far above the clouded, dark, dirty region where most thoughts are conversant-in such exercises and employments as are likest those of the Almighty Soul, or as we innately believe likest-in pure love, and in the wisdom accordant thereto. And my thoughts fled away, away; and deeper and deeper, from within my soul arose the assertion of purity and honor unstained. And I added a meditation; that the perfect being upon whom my contemplations were so intensely concentred, should be my own; that my hemispheric life should be rounded into full symmetry, by the conjunction therewith of the feminine thoughts and powers, which, by virtue of my manhood, I could not have. Thus I meditated, dreamed; without effort; without wish; for no such delightful trance had ever enrapt me before. And so my conscious intellection quite departed; and when I was recalled from my intuitional inner life-not now by a rude and angry shock, as if struck upon the face by one insulted, but, awaked by a sudden strong and clear exertion of independent will-and looked, in an overwhelming dread, which would lower upon me, in spite of my efforts, towards my companion, she sat with her face hidden between her two hands, turned from me, bowed down upon the arm of the sofa, in an agony of passionate weeping. 
                  I could not speak-I dared not speak. I apprehended all fatal things. It never occurred to me to doubt the power of the psychical insight; and that its clear light had shone upon some innermost debasement, of which I had been most profoundly and innocently ignorant, I despairingly, believed. And that was the worth of all my wisdom in self-measurement and self-estimation! 
                  Miss Chester suddenly sat upright; drove away her emotion, at least from outward manifestation; hastily dried her tears; threw back the hair which had fallen in heavy bands and curls over her face; turned her eyes straight and steadily to my own; and said, blushingly, but firmly, "I most fully believe you to be, and to have been, utterly pure and noble." 
                  "Pure, in truth; "I answered. "Noble in aspiration, if not in accomplishment. And I would thank you, if thanks were due, for justice done." 
                  She made no answer-apparently lost in some recollection tion. Nor could I desire to speak; for I exulted in silent joy at the recognition of the truth and honor which I had felt that I might fairly claim. The silence was prolonged almost to awkwardness, when the open piano caught my eye, and I said- 
                  "You promised me some music, Miss Chester. Will you please play?" 
                  She arose, and crossing to the instrument, sat down. Then she asked- 
                  "What music do you prefer?" 
                  "Music? If you will play me such as you like, I will promise to like it." 
                  "That is too complimentary. I want the music to please you in itself." 
                  "I did not mean a compliment. But does it displease you that I feel certain that I should of myself choose such music as you would, and therefore that I may trust you to choose for me?" 
                  She asked, without direct answer, and without looking at me-"Did you ever compose any music?" 
                  "Only in one way. Sometimes beautiful words have made themselves a melody for me, while I have been thinking them over, and I have written it, and played or sung it." 
                  She made no reply, but played a nocturn. It was intricate and monotonous, I thought. But was sad; and threw me into mournful thought. And I distinguished something veiled within, as it were; a soul of hidden meaning, within the exterior sounds; whose existence, however, was only suggested to me at the repeat at the last strain but one, and in the last strain. As the full chords of the last cadence died into silence, I said, almost unconsciously- 
                  "I wish I might hear that again." 
                   
                  She played it again. And that second rendering astonished me. The music was the same, yet not the same. I could distinguish the same ideas and strains which I had heard before. But the cadences and mournful singing of the quiet measures took on, now, a new and startling significance. 
                  The composition was entirely new to me. As I said, it had, at first, been simply a quiet and monotonous performance, difficult of execution; and not until near the end, as my ear began to interpret the singularly repetitious concatenations of the successive strains, did I catch a glimpse of any meaning; and even that had nearly escaped me. At the second hearing, however, I saw, if I may so speak, more clearly. The involved and almost superfluous instrumentation, the full and sustained harmonies, seemed to have been thrown around, as shadowing veils and draperies, to hide the import of the thread of melody; or to conceal it from all but the closest observation. And thus it came to me; flashing or streaming up; or sounding faintly and dimly; struggling from underneath the enveloping weight of the great volumes of sound; scarcely seen; as one might gaze down into a dark ravine, through boiling mountain mists, and here and there catch a glimpse of men, dimly distinguished, passing upon an unknown errand. In such a way I gradually became aware of the meaning of the singular combinations which were presented before me. But now, moreover, I began to be conscious of a strange, and yet of an uncommonly clearly indicated significance in the music; although it is perhaps a question liable to doubt, how much of this apparent tangibility of meaning is due to the general or contemporaneous condition or tendencies of my thoughts, and how much to the conceptions and executive success of the composer. But, at first faintly, as from an infinite distance, through darkness and clouds, sorrowful utterances were spoken; wailings of some one alone, fearful, rising now and then into loud sobs and clamorous cries of mercy. They grew more and more articulate; in melancholy distinctness they now resounded clearly above the clinging enwrapments of the full accompaniment. So clear was the representation that, as the wailing strains cried out to me, my eyes involuntarily filled with tears. But the lamentations and the lonely crying faded away. Then, muffled and dimly as before, came another strain-a lovely and sweet-flowing; strain, singing first from afar and then from nearer, comfort and hope. The wailing cry recommenced, as if the unhappy one sought consolation from the singer; and the sorrow and the joy for a time were chanted together. But the sad subordination of the mourner was modulated, ere long, by a magical representation of the same musical idea, but a sad one no longer, into a happy and harmonious sympathy with the loftier joy; and the whole drama was auspiciously concluded by the triumphant beauty of more unconcealed gladness which had first struck me in the latter part of the composition. It sang and rejoiced exceedingly; though still in the strangely restrained and hidden undercurrent in which the whole air was interpreted; in lovely and happy melody-the still, bright happiness of perfect content. 
                  The instrument was still. The lovely musician, too, sat motionless, but evidently in the keen excitement of an artist; with eyes cast down, and cheeks flushed; even, I fancied, refraining from tears, only by a strong effort. 
                  Neither of us thought of more music. We returned to our former seats. 
                  I entertained a curious hope about the music. "Miss Chester," said I, "did you compose that music?" 
                   
                  She answered; with confusion, however, and evident hesitation, "Yes." 
                  "Have you ever played it to others than me?" 
                  "Yes. Two or three times." 
                  "Did any one ever ask you to repeat it?" 
                  "No." 
                  "And was there a meaning in the music?" 
                  She answered almost inaudibly, "Yes." 
                  "I thought so," said I, "and I have discovered it. It meant sorrow; loneliness; longing; then satisfaction and joy. Did it not?" 
                  Of that I was quite sure. And I was, besides, so arrogant as to hope that she meant more than that; that that was a nothing-dross-mere miserable husks-to the delicious confession-the sweetest of all revelations-which I hoped I had heard. For I dared to think that she had spoken her longings to me in the music, as to one haply able to supply the desire of her heart-to drive the sorrow and the loneliness far away-that she had revealed her soul to me in that sweet and safe unspoken way, trusting that if I were indeed such an one as she desired, I should understand, the hieroglyph-the sacred hidden speech. This was the tumultuously joyful hope that illuminated and disturbed my mind; that unsteadied my hand; that made me tremble; that almost deprived me of the command of my voice. But still, with an ulterior design-for yet there was a possibility that I might by error be preparing an overwhelming disappointment-I had hidden all that part of my interpretation of the music for which I cared, and assumed, perhaps at the risk of appearing conceited, the completeness of the general translation which I gave in words. 
                  With sudden coolness-more delightful to me than a satisfied tone could have been, for I interpreted it to mean disappointment at the shallow reading, and mortification at the gratuitous and uncomprehended expenditure of emotion, Miss Chester answered- 
                  "You are right. But there was more; which, however, I suppose you could not be expelled to understand." 
                  "Perhaps not," I answered, with as much indifference as I could command, seeing that her answer corroborated my suspicion. "But I am exceedingly obliged to you for the music; and more, for displaying to me what you do not grant to many-the result of your own thoughts, and the workings of your own soul." 
                  "Have I?" she asked with a sudden bitterness. 
                  "Yes; you have. But I was to read you a passage from an old book, bearing upon the psychological matters of which you and I have some experience. Shall I?" 
                  "If you please," she said coldly, and with evident disinclination to listen. 
                  "I will," I replied. "And I had liefer read it now, than before the beautiful music, or before I came here this evening." 
                  Then I took the book, and read from Cap. Tertium, commencing with the second paragraph; rendering the old German into partly correspondent English, as follows: 
                  "Now shall I show how there is included in the major or principal sympathy which worketh from Our Lord to his creatures, and returneth back from them to him-whether such creatures possess the life of the stone only, or that and the life of the tree, or those and the life of the beast, or the life of the man, which is the synthesis of the three with the Love and Wisdom of Our Lord therein infused-the sympathy in singulis.
                   
                  "For this sympathy, namely, the major, is such as that in it we all, who are human, are one; since only by virtue of intimate oneness could interchange and increase of life be permitted; therefore we, our fathers, and those who shall follow us, are, except for the extenuation of Time, one and the same being. 
                  "And sith it be so, we may now the readier comprehend the case of such who are drawn together by an unisonous nature, being, in course of accident, put each within the sphere and influence of the other. But first I would discuss the reasons why not all are so drawn in love to consonance of society and unity of thought and will. This is like that case of the unfriendly rivers, whereof the pure, in horror of the other's turbid flow, refused mingling; and ran a far way to the sea, apart by itself, upon a line drawn between. For in such wise is it that pure minds are wont to withdraw, and not to have converse with the common, the maculated souls by sin, by folly and by worldliness; so as that they do harbor all alone, and thereby do oft-times miss of meetings which might befall to them mingling in the crowds. And likewise, the imperfection which sin has seated so deeply in men doth cause imperfection of body and of mind, contrariously to the will of the imperfect; and that imperfection, meeting another imperfection, may not consent therewith, and consent and union may not be; no more than oil may mingle With water, though both be of no mean nature in themselves, because they be differently directed. And moreover, the perfectness of this union can by no means be, except between a man and a woman; for they be so by Our Lord made, alike yet differing, as that the strength and wisdom of the one may counterbalance the weakness of the other, and the loving and intuitions of her nature may fill many offices which the man cannot do. For no one nature, less than Our Lord's, is perfect. And the two things which be most extreme in contradiction one of another; and thus the quiet and loving woman and the strong and bold man; do in their synthesis and unity arise into truth and perfection, such as our humanity may attain, before we arise into the heaven of Our Lord. 
                  "And thus it is, that the noble Love of perfect union is rare; since to it there go many conditions preliminary and needful; and also many there be which I do not here enumerate; treating them in full in another place; and moreover, untrue torsions and perversions from the training and governance suffered in youth, do discourage and weaken the Inner Truth; insomuch that where such persons may perchance be cognizant each of the other, the woman saith nothing, since she believeth, by her instructions had, that love and a perceived union should ever be quite concealed, and not by any means intimated to any; and she doth no longer clearly see the light of that Truth which would advise to the speedy signification of the recognised wish. Nor doth the man speak, for he is by the false humility taught by his governors inured to hide his goodness in silence; for poverty; or for small learning; or for some empty crust or ghost of accident; insomuch that he repels and silences the Inner Truth which would fain speak to the woman. 
                  "But seldom therefore doth it fall out that such are revealed to one another by the speech of the inner voice; and they be by that voice known one to another, having articulated naught; and if only they be such, by fortune of their life and experience, that they have lived in the freedom of the thoughtful; and if haply they do speak, and their spoken minds do harmonize in that outer manifestation of the true life hidden beneath the threefolded veil of the body, the mind, and the will, then sad and miserable is their after-lot if they shall then depart either from the other. For having let go the unity and beauty in living, which is the fortune of few, and which Our Lord thus presents ready at their hand, right is it that they should not fro-wardly prevail to have the precious jewels of Our Lord submitted as vile wares to the unsteady choice of their careless hesitation and tardy folly. And not twice within the small life of man is that to happen; nor, truly, oftener than once in the lives of millions of men." 
                  I laid the book away in silence. I dared not look at Miss Chester. I had spoken more clearly than the music. I had shot my bolt, but I dared not, for the moment, question whether the mark was hit. Yet the misery of the suspense forthwith arose over the hesitation; I looked; but she sat motionless, looking down. I could not bear to wait, or to leave anything longer indefinite. 
                  "Irene," I said- 
                  She started, but did not answer, nor look up. 
                  "Irene, the old man from whom. I read, spoke for me; and what he says is true. I desire to confess to you that I hid part of the truth, in interpreting the music to you, so that I might answer what I believed it said, in the same hidden way. But my interpretation was bolder and deeper than I said. If I understood the music, you will not be vexed that I am so free to call you Irene." 
                  She did not move or speak. I dared to take her hand. It resisted not; but as I touched her, she trembled and sighed. 
                  "Irene, if I understood the voice of the music, I may hold your hand in mine. But will you not raise your eyes to mine?" 
                  She did. And the sad beauty of her deep eyes, for they swam in springing tears, and there were traces of tears upon her flushed cheeks, brought tears into my own. Sadly and steadily, but as if with intensest effort, she gazed. 
                  "Irene-my Irene-if I understood the voices of the music, I may love you; and you will love me-and be my Irene-my Peace-my life-long peace." 
                  Still she answered not; but her tears overflowed now. 
                  "You will not deny me, Irene, will you?" I drew her towards me and kissed her. She did not endeavor to prevent it. She returned the kiss. 
                  And though she did afterwards withdraw herself from within my arms, and gently insisted that I must go, for that time, offering me the farewell kiss, of her own accord; and though we have been often out of each other's sight, my Irene-my beloved wife-and I have never been parted since. 
                
             
             
                
               III. MRS. MACSIMUM'S BILL. 
                
                  TRYING IT ON. 
                  "PSHAW! this will never do, Madame Larami!" 
                  "But madam!"- 
                  "You will have to alter it altogether. It's wretchedly made." 
                  "I'm sorry"-began madame in a soft silky voice, which seemed to have taken its texture from the glossy fabrics she dealt in, while a black shadow, almost a frown, flitted across her sallow features, unseen by Mrs. Macsimum, and contradicted her tone of gentle sorrow. 
                  "Oh! bother!" continued Mrs. Macsimum, giving her shoulders that wriggle peculiar to ladies who are in the act of trying on a new dress; "did any one ever see such a body? why the thing is completely spoiled-'tis really too bad;" and she gave the apricot silk an impatient tug just where it very imperfectly pretended to conceal her bust. 
                  "I am very sorry indeed, Mrs. Macsimum, that the dress doesn't please you," said Madame Larami, the black shadow on her face growing more and more like a cloud; "but I can assure you we took particular pains with that dress, and if I may be allowed an opinion, I think, ma'am, that you are mistaken about its not fitting you." 
                  "The body isn't half low enough," answered Mrs. Macsimum, pettishly; "don't you see that? I'm not going to cover myself up like an old maid, Madame Larami!" 
                   
                  "We can have that remedied in an hour if you wish it, said madame, with her face shot with black like a half mourning silk; "but look at that skirt, ma'am. I'm sure nothing could hang better." 
                  "Oh! the skirt is well enough, Larami," said the lady endeavoring to get a back view of the dress in a Psyche glass, by twisting her head over her shoulder, "and those black lace flounces look very well-but, Larami, are they real Valenciennes?" 
                  "I have charged them as such in the bill, madam, and I never commit frauds on my customers." 
                  "Oh! I didn't mean that, Larami," answered Mrs. Macsimum, rather hurriedly, for Madame Larami's offended dignity at this instant was appalling-"but you know that everything is mock nowadays, and you might be deceived as well as another." 
                  "I'm never deceived, Mrs. Macsimum; we, poor milliners, have to be very cautious." 
                  "I've no doubt-I've no doubt, Larami," said Mrs. Macsimum, impatiently. 
                  "There was Mrs. Crissalis, the other day, ma'am-I was very near losing a thousand dollars by her, when Mr. Crissalis failed. But I was cautious, Mrs. Macsimum, and I have my little ways of knowing, so I sent in my little account a few days before the gentleman went, ma'am." 
                  "Very prudent of you, Larami," said Mrs. Macsimum, with a sickly attempt at a smile. "A shocking thing, that failure of Mr. Crissalis. I pity his wife greatly, poor woman. By the way, have you brought that Indian scarf with you?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am," said the dressmaker, unfolding one of those wondrous combinations of fine texture and brilliancy of color which the East alone is able to produce. 
                  "It is a lovely scarf, certainly," exclaimed the lady, flinging it over her shoulders-" and goes admirably with this dress. I shall take it, madame." 
                  Madame Larami bowed. 
                  "Now, madame," went on Mrs. Macsimum, "remember you must be punctual with this dress. The alterations must be done and the dress here by eight o'clock." 
                  "It shall be here, ma'am, to the moment." 
                  "You see I shall have to be dressed early, in order that I may see to the flowers, and give a few directions about the supper-table. That's the worst of being obliged to go to one's own balls." 
                  Madame Larami endeavored to appear penetrated with sympathy. 
                  "Now, Larami, you can take these things off, for I expect Cremolino here every moment to dress my hair." 
                  Madame Larami, obedient to the hint, immediately proceeded to divest Mrs. Macsimum of the elegant but expensive dress about which she was so fastidious, and in a few moments that lady was once more reclining in a vast easy-chair, with her fine though somewhat large figure dimly outlined through the soft folds of her peignoir. 
                  The apartment in which she sat was the type of modern luxury, subdued by a certain refinement of taste, which Mrs. Macsimum had caught up in spite of herself during a long residence in Paris. It was a boudoir, to which a coved ceiling gave an air of loftiness almost disproportioned to its area. The walls were painted with warm but subdued coloring. A faint pink staining in the glass of the windows filled the room with a rosy light, so much so that middle-aged ladies who visited Mrs. Macsimum, and young ones who had left their complexions at the last ball, loved that little boudoir and its becoming tints. 
                  Mrs. Macsimum's toilette-tables-for she had more than one-revealed a system of personal culture of the most elaborate nature. The secrets of artificial beauty of every nation under the sun seemed to have found their way to Mrs. Macsimum. Turkish cosmetics for darkening the eyes, and reddening the finger-tips. French mysteries, by which the palest cheeks and bluest lips could be made to bloom once more with the rich tints of health. Wonderful yellow paper-books with what seemed to be green leaves thrust between the pages, which green leaves, when rubbed on the cheek, by some chemical magic, would be found to leave a pink trace. Boxes of subtle powders, sovereign for giving the skin what the French call a velout appearance. Bandolines, on the production of which the greatest chemists of the age had lavished years of labor. Pieces of pumice-stone, set in mother-of-pearl handles, and useful for reducing a roughened hand to a satin smoothness; all these things flanked, and surrounded, and mixed up with a gleaming and variegated array' of Bohemian glass flaons, vinaigrettes, bouquet-holders, ivory brushes, gold and silver dressing-apparatus, crystal and agate cups, filled with fanciful trinkets, over all of which a thousand delicious odors floated in a mingling vapor, as if the rosy flasks and veined vases were really perfumed like the flowers whose hues they copied-all this, I say, formed a coup d'il, the first impression of which would be, that the majestic-looking woman who reclined so lazily in the crimson fauteuil, was indeed a modern Namouna, surrounded by the spells with which she conquered time and age. 
                  The apricot dress was once more carefully folded and laid in a basket, delicately covered with oiled silk, which a negro boy bore behind the fashionable milliner, when she walked abroad on business. Mrs. Macsimum had resigned herself to the contemplation of the Indian scarf, which she was idly flinging in different folds over the back of a French chair near her, when Madame Larami, having disposed her black silk visite coquettishly across her shoulders, stopped just before Mrs. Macsimum, and drew a letter from her pocket. At this hour of the day, that lady always possessed the ability to blush. The steadfast color which glowed on her cheeks of evenings was not yet applied, and on this occasion, the blood rushed to her pale face in a torrent, as the milliner drew forth the note. 
                  "Your bill, I suppose, Larami," said she with a faint smile, holding out her hand for it. "Mr. Macsimum is not going to fail, I hope?" 
                  "O! ma'am, I couldn't think of such a thing," replied Larami, with a dark smile. "It's not my bill, ma'am, but a note that a-a gentleman asked me to give to you." 
                  "A note for me, from a gentleman! let me see;" and as she took it, an expression of wonderful relief spread itself over her countenance. 
                  "Yes, ma'am-Mr. Sillery Payne begged of me to deliver it to you when you were alone." 
                  "Mr. Sillery Payne!" cried Mrs. Macsimum, opening the note with rather an agitated hand, while at the same time a smile of gratified, something or other-perhaps vanity-dawned in her large blue eyes. "How imprudent!" she murmured to herself, as she read the contents of the scented paper. "How impertinent!" she exclaimed aloud, for the benefit of Madame Larami. "You can tell Mr. Payne that you have delivered his note, Larami," she continued, tossing it carelessly into an Indian basket half full of notes of invitation, bills, and little gilt dancing lists, "and mention to him, that when I see him this evening, I will give him the information he desires." 
                  "I shall do so, madam," said Larami, drawing another elegant-looking inclosure from her abundant pocket. "I hope, Mrs. Macsimum," she continued, always smiling that sallow smile of hers, "I hope that you will not think me intrusive if I submit this little account to your inspection," and so saying, she gently insinuated the note towards her customer. 
                  Mrs. Macsimum lost in an instant that delicate smile of triumph which the perusal of Mr. Sillery Payne's communication had awakened. She cast a rapid and suspicious glance at madame, and jerked the refined-looking bill from her hand. 
                  "Do you want any money immediately, Larami?" she asked in a would-be careless tone, but in which a certain half-concealed eagerness could be easily detected. 
                  "Well, ma'am, to tell you the truth, I am very much pressed just now. My rent falls due to-morrow, and I have to meet a note of mine, which Mr. Lustring, the silk mercer, holds, at twelve o'clock on the same day. Not to inconvenience you, however, ma'am, I will manage with half the account now." 
                  "Let us see," said Mrs. Macsimum, extracting from its envelope the sheet of satin paper, in which all her elegant follies were truthfully chronicled. "Good heavens! Larami!" she exclaimed, starting and turning still more pale. "How on earth do you make it out so much? Three thousand five hundred and twenty-five dollars!" 
                  "I think you'll find it quite correct, madam. The fancy dress for Mrs. Hornet's ball was very expensive, and that green Persian scarf cost eight hundred dollars in the country. I shall be quite willing to have you examine all the items, Mrs. Macsimum. I don't think you will find any overcharges." 
                  "Oh! I suppose not-I suppose not, Larami. But still it's a very large amount." 
                  "It's been running a long time, madam." 
                   
                  "But I paid you considerable sums at various times." 
                  "I have given you credit for all payments, ma'am." 
                  "I'm afraid, Larami," and Mrs. Macsimum assumed a charming smile which seemed to convey, that it would be cruelty to press so enchanting a woman for a paltry sum of money; "I am very much afraid that my bank account will not admit of my letting you have what you want, and I can't ask Mr. Macsimum, you know." 
                  "Very sorry, indeed, ma'am, to press a lady, but I cannot possibly do without the money." 
                  "Oh, nonsense, Larami," said Mrs. Macsimum, with a reckless air, "you must try. In the course of a week or so, I may be able, but just at the present I really cannot." 
                  Madame Larami summoned her negro, and deposited the precious basket in his sooty hands; gave her black silk mantilla another twist before the glass, and making a profound courtesy to Mrs. Macsimum ere she left the room, said in her low silky voice- 
                  "I will call with the dress this evening, myself, Mrs. Macsimum, and get the money." 
                  "Madame Larami!"--cried Mrs. Macsimum, with an indignant flush at the cool, determined tone of the milliner; but ere she could utter her displeasure, a gentleman pushed madame aside, closed the door in her face, and flung himself into the fauteuil that Mrs. Macsimum had just quitted. 
                  "Well, Mrs. Macsimum," cried this last visitor, passing his hands briskly through his short stubby hair, "well, it's all up with us, we shall be protested to-morrow." 
                  "Mr. Macsimum! what under heaven do you mean?" cried his wife, growing, if possible, paler than ever. "You surely don't mean to say that--" 
                  "Precisely. The firm of Macsimum & Bullrush will smash to-morrow." 
                   
                  "Good God!" exclaimed the lady, sinking into a chair, "what intelligence this is to bring to me! And how coolly you seem to take it, as if you alone were to suffer! Are you not ashamed of yourself, Mr. Macsimum, to go and fail in this way? What am I to do, I should like to know?" 
                  "The best you can, my dear," answered Mr. Macsimum, calmly. "My character, thank God, will remain unstained. I have surrendered everything." 
                  "You have, have you?" almost shrieked the lady. "You're an idiot, Mr. Macsimum! What was your character to me, I should like to know, that you leave me to starve in order that you might preserve it? Your character isn't good to eat or to wear; your character won't pay house-rent, or buy a box at the opera. I am sure, Mr. Macsimum, if I had known that such treatment was in store for me, it would have been long before I would have become your wife." 
                  "Too late to regret that now, my dear." 
                  "It's all your own fault, sir; our recklessness and extravagance knew no bounds." 
                  "I think, Mrs. Macsimum," answered the gentleman, looking round the room with a sarcastic twinkle in his clear gray eye, "if I have been extravagant, you have kept me in countenance." 
                  "Oh! yes. Say it's me! That's the usual answer. I spend everything! The smallest necessary of life that I purchase, is immediately magnified by you into a useless luxury. Perhaps you'd like me to go without shoes, Mr. Macsimum? I might save you a little money in that way." 
                  "Chut! chut! Mrs. Macsimum, let us have no quarrelling. This misfortune cannot be helped. It is one of the chances of trade, and we must bear it. To-morrow, at twelve o'clock, our paper will be protested, and all the street will know it Until then, let us put the best face on matters; and at this ball to night, be careful not to betray yourself. For there is always a chance of retrieving as long as the affair is secret." 
                  "I could cry if it were not for this ball," said Mrs. Macsimum, with an intonation and compression of the lips that would seem rather to indicate that she could scratch. But a servant announcing the arrival of Cremollino the hair-dresser, she controlled her feelings. Her husband was excluded, and in a few moments a pair of fat Italian hands were twisting and crisping her hair into the intricate labyrinths prescribed by fashion. 
                  "Larami must have had some intelligence of this," murmured Mrs. Macsimum; "or she would never have been so insolent." 
                
                
                  TEMPTATION. 
                  THE earliest guest that was whistled in that evening, through Mrs. Macsimum's magnificent portals in Fifth Avenue, was Mr. Sillery Payne. 
                  "Be civil to him, my dear," whispered Mr. Macsimum to his wife, as he heard the name announced, "he is one of our chief creditors." 
                  Mr. Sillery Payne was a New York celebrity. Rich, travelled, sufficiently handsome, with a low, sweet voice, and a hand and foot of marvellous smallness. He had gone through all the phases of an American who had been born wealthy. Had gambled, gone abroad, fought a duel in Paris, got imprisoned in Austria, "presented" in London, and finally returned with an accomplished Italian valet, and an astounding reputation for bonnes fortunes.
                   
                   
                  In a few moments after his arrival, he was seen gliding up the spacious drawing-room to the small boudoir in which Mrs. Macsimum received, and where she sat in all the glory of the apricot silk and Indian scarf, with an uneasy smile fastened as it were on her lips, and the unreal bloom of rouge reddenihg her cheeks. 
                  "I got your message. Thanks!" whispered Mr. Sillery Payne, sandwiching the sentence between a couple of audible compliments. "How charmingly your rooms look to-night, Mrs. Macsimum!" 
                  "The flowers are pretty, I think," replied the lady, assuming a pretty air of total unconsciousness of the whisper. 
                  "They would be if their queen were not present," said Mr. Sillery Payne, with so dvou an air that the stupid commonplace was immediately elevated into a compliment. 
                  "Mr. Payne, I forbid compliments for this evening, and shall banish all who trangress the edict," and a juvenile threatening with her fan accompanied Mrs. Macsimum's prohibition. 
                  "The sun might as well compel the flower to remain closed in daytime. Compliments are the incense which the divinity of beauty forces from us." 
                  "You have disobeyed my edict. You know the punishment. Go!" 
                  "Well, as I see a whole tribe of invited ones flocking into pay their compliments to you, I will accept my exile with a good grace. For I would rather be away from you altogether, than be in your presence and not be able to talk to you without restraint." 
                  "Flatterer, get thee behind me!" 
                  "Meet me in an hour in the winter garden;" and without waiting for an answer, Mr. Sillery Payne with a careless less bow turned upon his heel and sauntered off to quiz the ugly Miss Rhinebeck who was occupying a huge sofa in profound solitude. 
                  "By the way," said Mr. Sillery Payne, as, an hour afterwards, he and Mrs. Macsimum were slowly walking arm in arm in the huge winter garden that opened into the ball-room; "by the way, I see my friend Madame Larami sitting in the hall. What part is she to play in the night's entertainments?" 
                  Mrs. Macsimum bit her lips. This had been what she dreaded all the evening. Larami had vowed not to quit the house until Mrs. Macsimum had given her the sum she required, and was sitting patiently in the hall waiting until some one interrogated her, when it was as likely as not that she would burst out with an expos of the entire business. Mrs. Macsimum, however, summoned up courage, and replied in an off-hand manner: 
                  "Oh! I suppose the good creature is studying her profession. I believe she asked leave to sit in the hall and watch the ladies' dresses." 
                  "Hem! Mrs. Macsimum, there isn't a word of truth in that, and you know it." 
                  "Mr. Payne, you are too insolent, sir. Let us return." 
                  "Now, my dear Mrs. Macsimum, do not too readily take offence at my bluntness. I wish sincerely to be your friend. I would make any sacrifice, no matter what, if it was to obtain your happiness. Why not then confide in me? I know that you need a friend into whose ear you can pour all your troubles and your joys. Let me be that friend." 
                  "Really, Mr. Payne, I don't know what to think; this offer is so strange-yet if it were sincere, I think--" 
                  "It is, it is, sincere! You know not, you can never know, how I have yearned for this hour. With what crazed longings I have waited for the chance that was to enable me to assume the hallowed position of your friend. It may seem cruel, but I cannot help feeling rejoiced at this little annoyance of yours, since it gives me the opportunity of hastening to your assistance. It is the selfishness of love!" 
                  "Mr. Payne, I must not listen to this. My husband--" 
                  "Your husband! Excuse me, dear Mrs. Macsimum; but do you think that your husband is capable of understanding you? Can he comprehend that sublime, yet tender nature, in which a living well of affection is inclosed, and which requires only the touch of the inspired hand to flow out in a glorious stream? Oh! no, dear friend. His nature is one that can never match with yours!" 
                  This bombast, uttered, as it was, in the most melodious of voices, and accompanied by pressures of the hand and tender and eloquent glances, seemed to Mrs. Macsimum,-whose judgment in such matters was regulated by Indiana and the Mysteries of Paris-the very acme of impassioned pleading. In spite of the old theory of boarding-school misses, women of thirty are far more apt to be carried away by a bit of romance than the bread-and-butterest of young girls. It is their last chance, and they make the most of it. Mrs. Macsimum, therefore, could not long resist such flattering eloquence, and soon bestowed on Mr. Sillery Payne that confidence for which, according to his own account, he would sacrifice so much. She told him how this bill of Larami's was hanging like the sword of Damocles over her head. How that pertinacious milliner was determined to have the money or expose her; and how she dared not ask her husband for so large an amount, because-because (here she stammered a little) he had been so very liberal to her lately." 
                   
                  "Now, my clear Aurelia," said Mr. Sillery Payne, taking her hand at the same moment that he assumed the prerogative of calling her by her first name; "my dear Aurelia, there is one little fact connected with this business which you have omitted to mention. I do not, however, need any information on the subject. I am in full possession of all the particulars. Mr. Macsimum's paper will be protested to-morrow. I see you know it already Mrs. Macsimum's Bill. well, you now see how impossible it is for him to assist you." 
                  "It is! it is!" cried Mrs. Macsimum, utterly humiliated, and trying hard to prevent her tears from streaking her cheeks; "I see it all, and am a miserable woman!" 
                  "As to this little affair of Larami's, dear Aurelia-Eh! what's that?" and he started, as something rustled through an alley of huge kalmias. 
                  "Oh! it's the pet, Lory, I suppose; he sleeps here every night." 
                  "Ah, indeed!" ejaculated Mr. Payne, much relieved; "about this affair of Larami's," he continued, "nothing is simpler. I will just go into that small room, there, and write a cheque, which I will hand her in your presence. As for your husband's failure, I, being chief creditor, can lessen the weight of the blow considerably; nay, I can save him, and I will, Aurelia, if you will only consent to call me friend. Now, try once." 
                  "My friend," murmured Mrs. Macsimum, leaning upon his shoulder. "Thanks, dear Aurelia. Now let me go and appease this infuriated milliner." 
                  As they stepped from the dusky conservatory into the small study which opened off one end, a gentleman, seated at a table writing, met their view. He turned, on hearing their footsteps, and they recognised Mr. Macsimum. 
                  "Ah! is that you, Payne?" he cried, smiling pleasantly; "you catch me doing a little business on the sly. Well, well, I'll have done with it for to-night, for I can see you want a tte--tte with my wife." So saying, he gathered up a couple of slips of paper on which he had been writing, and with a sort of quizzical adieu, left the room. 
                  "Happy mortal!" sighed Sillery Payne, as he wrote a cheque for the amount of Larami's bill; "he is not suspicious." 
                  "He has never had cause," said Mrs. Macsimum, indignantly-then, recollecting herself, she colored violently, and cracked one of the delicate vanes of her fan. 
                  Sillery smiled. 
                  "Now, Aurelia," said he, "let us go and see Larami." 
                  "Pardon me, Mr. Sillery Payne," said Mr. Macsimum, presenting himself smilingly at the door, just as that gentleman was about to emerge with the enchanting Aurelia on his arm. "Pardon me, Mr. Sillery Payne, you may spare yourself the trouble. I have just had an interview with that amiable modiste." 
                  Mrs. Macsimum shrieked, and, gliding to the nearest sofa, disposed herself in the most approved comatose attitude. Mr. Sillery Payne fiddled with his breloques, while an air of unpleasant silliness, commencing at his boots, began to spread itself gradually over his entire figure. 
                  "I am immensely indebted to you, Mr. Payne, for the interest that you take in my wife's affairs, and would be only too happy that she should avail herself of your liberal offers, if there was any longer a necessity for it. Thanks to some conversation which I happened to overhear in the conservatory--" 
                  A renewed shriek from Mrs. Macsimum on the sofa, and sudden assumption of a more striking pose.
                   
                  "Which I happened to overhear," continued Mr. Macsimum, entirely oblivious of his spouse's efforts to obtain sympathy-"and was consequently enabled to be beforehand. Madame Larami, Mr. Sillery Payne, I have the honor to inform you. has just been paid in full." 
                  "I am happy to hear, Mr. Macsimum," answered Mr. Payne, with sarcastic emphasis, "that your affairs are in so flourishing a condition. I trust that they will remain so until after to-morrow." 
                  "When I drew that check, Mr. Payne, to pay for my wife's follies, it was the last money that I had in the bank. I gave it willingly, sir, because I preferred being a pauper myself, to my wife being a beggar. As I went to the door, sir, a telegraphic dispatch from Boston met me, which alters the face of my affairs considerably; and if Mr. Sillery Payne will present those claims on the firm of Macsimum & Bullrush, which he holds, to-morrow at twelve o'clock, he will find little traces of insolvency in their bank account." 
                  At this juncture, Mrs. Macsimum seemed to be restored suddenly to animation. She forsook her elegant attitude, and came over timidly, but with an air of penitence, whether honest or not I dare not speculate, to where her husband stood. 
                  "George," she said, in a low voice, "you have read me a lesson. Will you complete your nobleness by forgiving me?" 
                  "My dear," answered her husband, "I have too much to blame myself for, not to be lenient to others. You may learn one thing, however, Aurelia, that Madame Larami is a dangerous woman to hold any power over you. She has been known," and he fixed his eyes upon Mr. Sillery Payne, "to be in the pay of certain fashionable gentlemen for the worst purposes." 
                  "I see-I see it all now," murmured Mrs. Macsimum, hiding her burning cheek upon her husband's shoulder. 
                   
                  "Hush! think no more of it. There! are you not engaged to Mr. Payne for this dance? Mr. Payne! my wife claims your hand, and may I pray that this conjugal exhibition may be no bar to that friendship which you so feelingly solicited." 
                  Mr. Sillery Payne bit his lip and bowed. With an inward curse, he took Mrs. Macsimum's hand, and was soon whirling her off in a waltz; but it was observed by the guests that they did not dance together again that evening. 
                  By a singular coincidence, the same moment saved Mr. Macsimum's credit and his wife's reputation. 
                
             
             
                
               IV. THE FEAST OF THE CRANBERRIES. 
                
                  I. 
                  OF all festivities at which it has been my fortune to assist, the annual merry-making in the fine old mansion, given by Major Wherrey, in commemoration of the gathering in of the cranberries, appear to me the most choice and delectable. 
                  I know that cavillers may try to invalidate this opinion by mentioning the fact, that this same Major Wherrey happens to be my uncle: or-what I confess would be more to the purpose-that Mrs. Major Wherrey (Kate Lawton that was) is undoubtedly my aunt. But I firmly believe myself unbiassed by family considerations, in the declaration just made; and so emphasize the matter by asserting that our Cranberry Party at Bearbrook, bears the same superiority over all other balls, picnics, or clambakes that, in the opinion of Mr. Addison's Cato, an hour of virtuous liberty held and possessed over an eternity of bondage. 
                  Eight years ago, when my uncle began to read upon the subject of cranberries, and favor all his friends with copies of a certain agricultural journal, containing lengthy dissertations going to prove the extreme practicability of raising bushels of this acid production upon land generally held profitless-at that time, I say, who could have anticipated that all this cogitation and scribbling was necessary to make way for a charming little note from a charming ing little aunt of two-and-twenty, that was left at my office (the note, not the aunt) one sunny morning in October last. And thus ran this delicious document: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              "DEAR TOM:-Your uncle and myself trust you will be able to visit us a week from next Thursday, when you will see me preside for the first time at the entertainment, which the Major tells me he has been accustomed to give for some years past. 
                              "Your uncle begs me to say that the men will begin to rake in the cranberries at seven A. M.; and that rakes will be provided for all visitors who may wish to take part. But I fancy it will be more interesting to you to know that Bessie Wacklestead is coming to stay with me. She paid you some great compliments, and as you like her so well, I don't see why you can't make up a match-it would be such fun quizzing you. There are going to be crowds of people besides-among them, several old friends of yours. Please excuse the shortness of this letter. In great haste, 
                              
                                 "Affectionately your aunt, 
                                 "KATE --.
                               
                            
                            
                              "P. S.-I haven't had a good polka since you and Dick Horripitts were up here last June." 
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  Perhaps it would be more delicate to represent the passage concerning Miss Wacklestead by a line of stars, but it was copied before I thought what I was about, and erasures so dreadfully disfigure a manuscript, and-on the whole it may remain. Well, my pulse quickened considerably as I thought of past feasts that had blessed this genial season, and my shoulders experienced a ghostly aching as I reflected upon the ceremony of "raking in," at which I had formerly assisted. My answer-of which I happened to take a pressed copy, by way of testing a newly contrived machine-was as follows: 
                   
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              "DEAR AUNT KATE:-It will give me great pleasure to come to Bearbrook next Friday week; though I can assure you there will be no stronger attraction than the satisfaction of visiting my amiable relative who is there resident. Pray make my respects to my uncle, and assure him of my deep regret that an unfortunate business engagement will prevent me from accepting his kind offer of the rake. I shall, however, be able to leave town by the eleven o'clock train, which will bring me to your table a little after the soup. 
                              
                                 "Believe me, very dutifully, 
                                 "&c., &c."
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  So much by way of introduction-for I can never give an account of anything without beginning a little way back-thus taking, as it were, a gentle run, in order to leap into the narrative with greater vigor. Not that any apology is necessary for the publication of these letters; which are conceived to be full as much to the purpose as the well known communications between committees and orators, which occupy the first page or two of the pamphlet containing their efforts-wherein the committee inclose a vote that somebody has passed respecting a chaste, elegant, and patriotic address, and the orator feigns to be taken by surprise, and says that his speech was hastily prepared amid the pressure of important business, and that no thought of publication had ever entered his fancy-from all which the reader is expected to perceive what knowing fellows the committee are, and what an uncommonly clever affair the orator could have produced, if he'd only tried. 
                  The eleven o'clock train on the morning of that Thursday to which the attention of the reader is now invited, performed its journey with unusual dispatch, and brought me to the carryall, that plied between my uncle's house and the station, full fifteen minutes before the hour anticipated. 
                  "Well! your honor's got in early to-day," remarked Mr. Netleswing, my uncle's farmer and right-hand man, who, to do me especial honor, had condescended to drive the carryall. 
                  "Yes, we made a quick run of it." 
                  "Well, now, I tell you what it is, Squire, you ought to ha' been up here to see them cranberries took in! It was a sight, now-I tell you. There was Deacon Smiler, who fetched his in day before yesterday. Well I says he-by gorry, says he, it does take you to raise cranberries, and that's a fact. What do you think o' them now?" 
                  Thus saying, Mr. Netleswing produced a handful of the produce in question for my inspection. 
                  "Well, now," continued he, without waiting for an opinion, "your uncle's just the first man in this county! Why, he's a beautiful old feller. To see him out there today with his coat off, a raking in cranberries for dear life! My wife, says she to me, says she, I never lived along with such a gentleman anywheres; and there's ma'am, too, says she, treats people so well, and never comes round scoldin' and hinderin', and then there's Mr. Tom, that's you, sir, when he comes down here"- 
                  "Well, well," said I, anxious to stop the stream of family compliments, "pray do not reveal what I trust Mrs. Netleswing did not mean to have repeated-but tell me what has become of old Esop, that always used to be driven between the house and the station? You have rather a smarter beast in the shafts to-day." 
                  "Well, now," responded my driver, commencing with his usual exordium, "there's just-just a little story about this 'ere mare, that I should like to tell your honor. You know that bull the Major had up here last spring-real Durham blood, and all that. Well, Squire Stebbins owned one that came from the same cow, and he turned out so dreadful ugly that he had to be killed for beef. Well, now, bull-beef don't pay at all, you know-leastways, 'cept when it's kinder young. So when the Major told me how Steb-bins's bull down here'd been actin', and how he wanted our'n killed, too, I says, says I, don't you do no such a thing; that bull can be tackled up, come ploughin' time, and the work he'll do'll be worth a sight more'n his beef. Well! the Major he was dreadful scarey, and thought he'd kill somebody, and it was 'bout a week 'fore he finally give in. Well, sir, I just went and put a ring through that feller's nose, and he ploughed for us just as pretty as a baby, sir-just as pretty as a baby, I tell you." 
                  "But what has this to do with the mare?" 
                  "Well, now, I'm a-comin' to that business. As our bull was ploughin' one day, who should come up but Cap'en Tolliwot, who goes in for stock like all time. Look here, Cap'en, says I, just you look at that bull. Well, by thunder, says the Cap'en, I never see a bull broke that way afore, no how-real Durham, too-will you take fifty dollars for him? No, Cap'en, says I, that feller's worth his hundred and fifty if he's worth a cent-first-rate stock for milk-kind in all harness-but I tell you what I'll do; we want another horse on the place, and I'll swap even for your bay mare. Well, the Cap'en swore he wouldn't think of it; but I see him eying the bull, and knew he wanted him bad, so I stuck out. Well, sir, he came round the next day, and said he'd make the swap. Won't do, says I, there's been two men up here to look at him this morning-can't trade without twenty dollars to boot. Give you ten, says he. Split it at fifteen, says I. Done! says he. There! sir, that's the way we came by this 'ere mare. We meant to ha' sold the bull this fall, and I 'spose we'd ha' got-well! we might ha' got sixty dollars for him. This mare's worth a hundred and fifty this minute. So, I call it-well-I call it a pretty fair trade." 
                  Several anecdotes of this description, all going to establish the shrewdness and sagacity of the relator, pleasantly beguiled the time till we drove up to the venerable mansion. 
                  My uncle was soon at the door, and my aunt too-you may be sure of that. They are not the sort of people to keep a guest standing in the porch till a servant answers the bell. Who would have guessed, by the Major's hearty shake of the hand, that the "raking in" had begun at seven o'clock that morning? And my aunt, too-how fresh and blooming she looked! What mortal nephew could be content with expressing his respect towards so fair a relative merely by a shake of the hand! If you can send me an authentic account of any such individual (properly sworn to before the nearest mayor), I may hereafter express contrition that I was not; but until such a document is received, I really cannot think of making an apology. Apology indeed! I regret having written the word. It is a wrong to the glorious liberality of a community that gives its wives and daughters to the polking embrace of any adventurer who may ask such favor, to suppose that a man could be required to gird himself with the sackcloth of a penitent, for the affectionate salutation of his own aunt. No, no-rather let us be thankful that an enlightened popular sentiment requires no such ignominious squeamishness at the hands of those who would court its favor. 
                  The company had not gone to dinner, but were privately consulting their watches (at least the rakers were so doing), and stealing glances towards the screen of green baize that stood in the entry to cover the retreat of the plate-bearers. There were numerous additions-such agreeable additions as must always follow a lady-to the usual circle of guests that the season brought together. There was Harry Wittlepipes, the moustached, pensive, and interesting flirt-and Dick Horripitts, who knows how to lead a German, if ever a man did; and there, too, was the young lady with the talent for crayon heads, and her sister with the talent for private theatricals, to say nothing of her brother without any talent in particular; there you might have seen Squire Tolliwot, the present possessor of the amiable bull, of whose barter the particulars have been written; besides, there was-but on the whole it is not worth while to trouble the reader with any more names just at present. And so the curtain shall be lowered for a minute or two, just to bring on the properties, and change the scene to the dining-room, where, having refreshed a little with soup, and stimulated a little with champagne, we will pursue this chronicle in good earnest. 
                
                
                  II. 
                  THE American cranberry, gentlemen," observed my uncle, from the lower end of the table (after the soup before mentioned had been removed, and the champagne just referred to had been opened)-"the American cran berry has characteristics very different from the plant that bears the same name in England. It is larger, more upright, and has leaves of greater convexity. The best method that has come to my knowledge of raising the American cranberry in England, was the ingenious contrivance trivance of Sir Joseph Barker. An artificial bog was prepared by this gentleman, in a manner that I shall presently explain, and the cranberry plants, brought from their native situation with the earth carefully about their roots, throve wonderfully. But a very curious difference observed between these vines and the Vaccinium Oxycoccus, described by Linnus, consisted in the-" 
                  "Good heavens!" whispered my aunt, "what shall I do? These good people have heard of nothing but cranberries since seven o'clock this morning-we must make him stop-do some of you tell me what to do!" 
                  The reflection of a moment suggested an expedient. A card with this little bit of writing upon it, was sent by a servant to my uncle's end of the table- 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              "DEAR MAJOR: Don't you think we had better not try to have general conversation? We really have great difficulty in hearing what you are saying at this end of the room. Affectionately, 
                              
                                 KATE."
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  "Talk! talk-all of you," whispered Mrs. Kate, the instant my uncle paused in his harangue to look at the card. "Don't let him get the floor again, or we shall never have an end of it." 
                  Thus adjured, Bessie Wacklestead and I, who were on one side of my aunt, and Wittlepipes, and the pretty Miss McDudley, who were opposite to us on the other, buzzed away as fast as possible; while my clever relative gave directions long and loud to the servants, and rattled the plates together with great dexterity. 
                  The object was accomplished by this magnificent coup. After one or two despairing looks, directed towards our corner of the apartment, my uncle resigned himself to fate, and bestowed his cranberries and his tediousness solely upon his immediate neighbors. 
                   
                  "There, now," said my aunt, after she had helped to the chicken-pie-"there is no use in you four people keeping up this constant and confidential intercourse any longer. All the danger has passed; and you will have time enough to flirt after dinner. So, I expect you to extend the conversation for my benefit. Just to think that I'm a poor married woman, that nobody likes to talk to!" 
                  If you could have seen the arch look with which my aunt accompanied her words-if you had felt (as I did) those fair black eyes penetrating every fibre with their soft, magnetic influence, it would not have seemed very hard to stop the conversational coach, even at its best speed, to take up such a fascinating passenger. Not that I think a tte--tte dinner can generally be improved-that is, provided you get next the right person. But, bless you, such a third person as Aunt Kate is no hindrance at all. She was a regular watering-place belle, and picked up in the course of her wanderings a vast deal of discretion and liberality-and now she's a married woman, and of course understands everything, and-in short, I can assure you, you would no more mind saying anything pleasant before her, than you would in the presence of a domestic cat. 
                  "My dear aunt," said I, "has not experience taught you never to use the vulgar verb 'to flirt!' You remember what a set-down you gave the lady who asked if you polked;-'No, madam, I dance'-was your reply. Depend upon it that those who polk are not more anxious that their performance receives the sanctification of dancing, than are those who flirt (if such people there be) desirous of making a compromise with conscience by selecting a suave and gentle word to express their infirmity." 
                   
                  "I can't say I exactly agree with you," said Wittlepipes, withdrawing his eyes from the face of his companion, and adjusting himself for one of those outpourings of talk for which he was famous-"I do not agree with you in considering the indulgence you have mentioned as necessarily either an infirmity or transgression. It is very true that there have been few people so often held up to scorn, and so generally supposed to be very naughty, as those whose impulsive nature and ability of pleasing lead to that exercise of power known as 'flirting.' Those esteemed guilty of this folly are held up to virtuous indignation in all possible ways. They sustain the unwholesome drizzle of moral novels, and are pelted with those caustic little scraps that fill odd corners of family newspapers. Now I advance the doctrine that a flirtation, in itself, may be as innocent and harmless as a game of billiards, or an evening at the theatre. Like every other good thing, it may be greatly abused; but whether so natural and universal an enjoyment should be condemned from a few doubtful stories of broken hearts, is, I conceive, an open question. I am in the habit of taking a glass of port with my dinner, notwithstanding some people drink more than is good for them-I often play a game of whist, although many have been ruined by cards-and why, by a parity of reasoning, should those be utterly condemned who talk nonsense, and look lovingly in retired places, because match-making mammas and sensitive daughters, have occasionally been disappointed. I should be the last to excuse a lady or gentleman who, merely as a trial of skill, endeavored to interest a person with whom they felt no sympathy. But I really have some charity for those who, bewitched by a bright eye and pleasant smile, say certain things that are not meant, or taken in sober earnest,-but which serve to dispel the distasteful business of the day, and charm the senses into a state of fairy ecstasy, which leaves us all the better when it has passed away. You may talk of the pleasures of courtship and the felicity of an avowed, respectable, commonplace engagement; but what is the satisfaction of making long and compelled visits, of being smiled upon by papas, and congratulated by brothers, to the delight of making your way in spite of these powerful coadjutors, and creating an agreeable little understanding, all the more tender because unacknowledged to the world. 'Mr. So-and-So is a flirt'-how often do we hear such a sentence repeated, as if it implied all that is mean and contemptible! Not so fast, I am tempted to say; my young friend So-and-So exercises a talent that you never possessed. Nature designed you for a place in an office or counting-room; you have a pretty knack at speculating; you can write, drive, or play chess, as well as any one-but you have neither the figure, quickness, nor wit, to make yourself popular with the ladies; so do not judge so hardly those who have, and use them. In short, I consider the faculty of flirting as much a native grace and individual endowment, as is an extraordinary ability for making money a wonderful aptitude at getting rid of it, or any other natural gift. Let, then, such persons as are accused of this unfortunate practice be tried by their peers; and not by those whose dull and lymphatic natures can no more feel the temptation to pass an hour in a light and pleasant strife for admiration, than their stupidity would allow them to effect it, if they did." 
                  "It must be acknowledged," observed my aunt, "that a great deal of the fun of flirting comes from its doubtful propriety. We don't know that there's anything exactly wrong in trying to be as charming as we can, but we feel an uncertainty about it, a wondering what people will think, and a half admiration at our own boldness, which gives an infinite relish to the business. What a pity it is that the consciousness of provoking scandal should ever be attended with satisfaction; yet who cannot sympathize with the pork-loving gentleman who wished himself a Jew, that the enjoyment of his favorite dish might be heightened by the knowledge that he was sinning with every mouthful." 
                  "I believe you are in the right, madam," rejoined Wittlepipes, "just as firmly as I believe half this persecution proceeds from mere envy. There are but few of either sex who have the talent and address to make themselves really interesting, even for a single evening; and the world vents its spleen upon those who are more gifted than their neighbors-just as the fairy tales always makes the brightest boy the most unpopular in the family." 
                  Here, Miss Bessie and I came in strongly on the other side of the question. We endeavored to show that the judgment of the world was exceedingly correct, and that those people who did not exercise their ingenuity in such questionable pleasantries were prevented by a severe morality, rather than by any natural disability. 
                  The argument was waxing rather hot and loud upon both sides, when Mr. Barnard, who sat just below Miss McDudley, turned and said-"What a pity that no one ever found out what Professor Phantillo's recipe for becoming irresistibly fascinating happened to be; we should then be competent judges in the case-at least according to the opinion of friend Wittlepipes." 
                  "As for the Professor," rejoined Madam Kate (she always prided herself on the cleverness of the trick, and consequently was glad enough to talk of it when occasion could be made)-"when I came to Bearbrook I had the curiosity to make some inquiries about him. It seems he is a sort of matrimonial agent, and really undertakes to provide people with partners at prices varying according to the style of article they demand. One of his circulars, containing a full tariff of charges, was left at the house the other day. I wonder what was done with it!" 
                  "A tariff of charges!" cried Mr. Barnard; "come, come, this bringing matters, honestly and frankly, to the mercantile standard really pleases me! I can imagine the composition of such a document First, in large letters down the page {omitting the small type between each sentence) we should find-Professor Phantillo-Distinguished Astrologer-Crowned Heads of Europe-Ladies' Attention-Partners Positively Insured-Certificates From Clergymen of Various Denominations-One Price System-and then, in smaller letters, we should read the particulars:-For a first-class young man, of good family and independent fortune, $30-ditto, with moustache and yellow kids, $35. For a young gentleman with long hair, falling collars, and a talent for poetry, $12-ditto, when warranted his first love, $16. For an old gentleman of princely fortune, $50-ditto, when warranted to die in six months, $95. For a gay young buck, with a fascinating reputation for rakishness, $60-ditto, when warranted to have broken several hearts, and to have passed six nights in the watch-house, $203--" 
                  "Stop, stop, you sarcastic creature," interrupted my aunt; "no ladies should listen to so preposterous a libel; besides, let me tell you, you set your wares very much too high. You will never find purchasers at such exorbitant rates." 
                  "Oh, madam," replied Mr. B., "you do me great injustice; these are only the choice patterns, designed for people of property, fashion, and taste. See, how I would cater for the poor and vulgar, who, of course, must put up with a cheap and inferior article. Professor Phantillo has constantly on hand a good assortment of American poets-one of whom will be sent to any address on rece pt of three postage stamps. N. B. A first-class editor or historian may be had for six stamps." 
                  "Why you miserable old cynic," exclaimed my aunt, giving her head the prettiest little toss imaginable, "you're as bad as the Potiphar Papers, I declare you are! But this is always the way with you literary gentlemen-you think it necessary to keep up your claim to consideration, by affecting to be far above the weaknesses of ordinary mortals." 
                  "No, no," said Mr. Barnard, speaking with some deliberation, for he saw that most at table had turned to listen to him; "heaven forbid that I should be responsible for any such creed as that. On the contrary, I am of opinion that a severe and just series of magazine articles might be written, with Our Literary Society, for a title." 
                  "Oh, do write them, Mr. Barnard, and I'll promise to read them all, and to cut out your picture, when we get it as a frontispiece to Putnam, and have it neatly framed in black-walnut, and it shall always hang in my dressing-room." 
                  "No-I have never written for magazines, and hardly think I shall begin now; besides, I think it very doubtful if Mr. Putnam, or the editor of any other periodical, would choose to publish such papers. It would be hard to avoid the suspicion of personality, where the class under consideration are so generally known and conspicuous. And, indeed, one would be strongly tempted to draw upon individuals-think, for instance, what materials could be taken from Mrs. --'s Sunday evening teas. The jealousy, toadyism, petty abuse, slander, and servility, that are on weekly exhibition in those two small parlors, would supply material for some very graphic bits of composition! What a recognizable character we should have in that femme precieuse, Miss A., who was so consumed with envy at the success of Mrs. B.'s novel, that she actually bribed (not indeed with money, but with certain social favors the initiated can appreciate) one of her followers to write a savage notice of the same for the lowest of the evening papers. You have all heard the old story of the lion, who, having devoted his youth to the practice of the fine arts, acquired through his masterly handling of animated nature, the reputation of a very Landseer among the beasts. His great fame was, as you will remember, mainly based upon a copy (with slight alterations) of a wonderful picture possessed by some Timbuctoo Athenaeum, or Art-Union, representing a man in the act of conquering a lion. The emendation made in the subject (which was considered by the savans of the forest equal to the best guess of Mr. Collier's annotator) consisted in a very trifling change in the arrangement of the figures. By this "new reading," the conquering was just the other way-and the man, unarmed and helpless, lay at the mercy of the artist. If now I were required to write a new "moral" to this suggestive fable, it would read something like this: There have been recently published various articles from various pens, setting forth the lamentable condition of the fashionable society of American cities. The papas are all shown to be weak and covetous, the young ladies hopelessly silly, and the gentlemen inordinately dissipated. But let one of these waltzers turn chronicler-give him a note-book, and drift him gently into the literary clique that exists in every large city, and I will promise you revelations more startling, and weaknesses far more humiliating, than the keenest observer can gather from the well-gleaned fields of wealth, fashion, and their quarry of frivolities." 
                   
                  As no one seemed disposed to dispute the justness of reflections that seemed so pleasant a compensation for the wrongs that satirists have inflicted upon Young America, a short pause in the conversational action followed Mr. Barnard's remarks. My uncle's observations again floated to our part of the table. 
                  "The Swedish cranberry is not used as an article of consumption. It is, however, employed in boiling silver plate to its due degree of whiteness-the sharp acid corroding the superficial particles of me copper alloy. And now I am prepared to answer your question concerning the best mode of keeping this delicious production. I have discovered two ways in which the cranberry may be preserved in perfection for several years. The first is by drying the fruit carefully in the sun, and then stoppering it closely in bottles. The second, which I always recommend, and which will require a little illustration to describe, consists--" 
                  Here, my aunt made a successful sortie of talk, and succeeded in spiking the enemy's guns. 
                  But if you wish to know what she, or anybody else, said, you must consult some other member of the company, for the fact is, that I concluded the dinner in a subdued and confidential chat with my fair neighbor, Miss Wacklestead. And as the observations exchanged between the parties in question, though of great interest to themselves, cannot possibly concern the reader, we will hurry matters on, and the ladies off. 
                  Well! when the last skirt had vanished through the folding-doors, and those huge portals had closed after the retreating beauties, my uncle invited us to draw our chairs to his end of the table. Then, according to annual custom, were produced certain bottles of that old Con-stantia wine, which some connection of our family had imported in the year '73. And a famous old vintage it is-rather sweet and syrupy by reason of age, but still of a flavor and fragrance that recall the best beams of the sunny days that ripened the parent grape. 
                  At all events, its effect upon the company was benignant and genial. My uncle (having relieved his mind of its outer crust of cranberries) was very entertaining, and gave his version of the bull story with infinite humor. Mr. Barnard favored us with his favorite song known as the "Cockroach at Home," and we all roared out the chorus about the little cockroaches, who declare that they will not go to school without a double dose of lager-bier. Then there came some "imitations," by Wittlepipes, which were so exquisitely unlike the originals as to be extemely ridiculous. After that, there was another song, written for the occasion, very personal, and very funny-so much so, indeed, that it will not do for me to tell who sang it, or give the slightest abstract of its contents. Then everybody began to talk, though there seemed to be nobody disposed to listen-if we except two or three elderly citizens, who had gone to sleep. At which period of the entertainment, it suddenly occurred to my uncle that it was time to join the ladies-as perhaps it was. 
                  And here I propose to make another break in this narrative, for the purposes of meditation and preparation, before treating myself (and I trust, the reader) to a third and last chapter. Such pauses serve as opiates to the great agony of composition, and prepare the mind for a renewal of that earnest thought, and careful elaboration, which has hitherto characterized this history. But before closing, I may as well say, that several hours are supposed to elapse before the opening of the succeeding chapter. For it must treat of dancing-and I should show great ignorance of the natural laws, to expect the reader to take a mental part therein, after the dinner he has just finished. 
                  So, while the servants are clearing the table, the gentlemen on the piazza talking over the ladies, and the ladies in the parlor talking over the gentlemen, we (that is to say, myself, and my before-mentioned reader) will take a nap, call for a cigar, read the paper, or, in fine, amuse ourselves as we best may. 
                
                
                  III. 
                  I HAVE no great faith in practical jokes. 
                  This making fun of the bewilderment and concern of a neighbor, is at the best a very questionable diversion. Still, if anybody is foolish enough to do it, there is no additional harm in conducting matters after a methodical and approved fashion. And this may excuse me for giving two recipes for the successful obtaining of this pleasant excitement-both of which I have seen put into practice, and can conscientiously recommend. The first, which is rather limited in its application-requiring no less of scenery and preparation than is found at a masked ball at the Grand Opera-House, at Paris-may be stated thus: 
                  Take as the first ingredient, a verdant American youth (a Bostonian is always to be preferred), who has plenty of money, a limited understanding, and an overweening sense of his own and his family's importance. Then select half-a-dozen of the most intelligent ladies of your acquaintance, who are to be instructed to repeat certain sentences in the English tongue relating to family failings and eccentricities, which are supposed by the house of Somptueux (of which our friend is a promising scion), to be its own private property,-but which nevertheless are the talk of the town. 
                  Now take your newly-arrived countryman to the theatre, circus, or some place of public amusement, and finally, by the merest accident, propose to look in upon the masked ball at the opera. Here, having previously arranged matters with confederates, you make some excuse for leaving him a few minutes, and slip quietly into a private box near by, whence you may peep between the curtains and enjoy the fun. Mr. Somptueux has begun to be oppressed with a realization of his own unimportance, in the presence of so many people of whose customs and language he knows almost nothing, and whom he of course presumes have precisely the same amount of information concerning him-when a gay little mask runs up and addresses him by his Christian name, and demands, half in French and half in English, the particulars of that little affair with Anna Skeusomai, and whether it was really true that one of the guests pocketed a miniature at her last party! 
                  "How in the name of wonder!"-ejaculates poor S-"can this French woman-but no!-of course she can't-such a peculiar name too!-what an extraordinary coincidence-I never would have believed it." 
                  "Monsieur, if you please," says a timid little voice on the other side, "I would entender ze end of ze story about Aunt Kottabos and ze confituriere. How much was to pay, to say nothing of the naughty names she called!" 
                  "Just heaven!" mutters poor Somptueux, staggering against the nearest box, "there can be no coincidence here. To think those unfortunate expressions that my poor Aunt Kottabos in a moment of justifiable indignation applied to the confectioner, and which were so handsomely paid for, that we felt sure nobody could have heard of them-to think that they should be the common talk of Paris." 
                   
                  The poor fellow has no time to prepare a reply, or to beg the lady not to mention it any further, before his arm is taken by another fair friend, who wishes to know how it was possible that Cousin Sophy could have caught Mr. Optimus after that scandalous flirtation with Herr Kewpidd of the Belgravian Musical Society. Another tells some little adventures after Grandmother Vinum's last dinner; while a fifth breathes a family secret most important and significant-in short, a disclosure that makes our moneyed aristocrat tremble for his gentility. 
                  Well, the reader may imagine the course of horror, bewilderment, and blank dismay, to which bur friend was treated-he may also imagine (if he can) the satisfaction in assisting at the dispensation of such heroic practice. 
                  And now for the second method of producing a salutary astonishment in the breast of a fellow creature-a method that was practised at Bearbrook with entire success, upon the occasion now under consideration. 
                  Take a middle-aged or elderly gentleman of retired habits, refined tastes, and courtly manners-take, I say, some such pattern of a past school-and introduce him to a German. Of course you do not understand that the effect is to be produced by simply arming up some dweller by the Rhine, and repeating his name with that of the subject selected. A German, in its fashionable and orthodox significance, means, not a man, but a dance-a dance that the French call "the cotillon"-and which such Yankee gentlemen as affect an exaggerated Parisianity, designate Lur Cotyeeyon. But, if (a contingency hardly to be imagined in an enlightened reader of Putnam) you should never have seen the diversion in question, and demand at my hands a description of the same, I shall really be puzzled what to say. The most contradictory epithets are constantly applied to it. Dick Horripitts, in his sweetest manner, speaks of it as un rve du bonheur des dieux; while old Mrs. Sockdolager screamed out to me the other evening that she could never see it without thinking of Furrelli's great picture, "The Last Ball in Babylon," that hangs in one of the palaces at Florence. 
                  So, if you please, I will advance no particular opinion, but keep to my legitimate business, which is to report in a very humble way, the noticeable points in our evening festivity. 
                  "Oh, yes, I'm going to dance this new dance of yours," exclaimed my uncle in the innocence of his heart; "I've never seen it, to be sure, so you'll have to instruct me at first, but I shall soon get it by a little attention." 
                  "If you have really never seen the German cotillion," quietly remarked Mr. Barnard, "I should advise you to bestow the little attention as a spectator, before attempting to appear upon the floor." 
                  "Perhaps you are right; though I remember getting through the Virginian Reel and the Basket Quadrille, when Kate introduced them last winter for the first time; but still, if you will keep me in countenance, we will take chairs at the other end of the room, and see how we like it." 
                  So the Major and his companion went to the other end of the room, and the music gave those long-drawn sighs of anguish elicited by the process of tuning-and Dick Horripitts began to be very important, and bustle about, and marshal the company with a fan by way of truncheon-and finally all things were ready, and off we went in good earnest. 
                  The party that met round the dinner-table had received many important additions from the citizens and citoyennes of Bearbrook;-and some very pretty additions, too, from the latter class-though, it must be confessed, that provincial dancing is not so good as provincial beauty. 
                   
                  My aunt, of course, led with Dick Horripilts-and a pretty pair of dancers they were. How they steamed up and down that great room, followed by Bessie Wacklestead and myself, and afterwards by Wittlepipes and the eldest Miss Drachma, and then by everybody else, till the whole apartment seemed a sea of undulating heads. There was some spirit in the dancing that night, I can assure you. Ladies formed parties of threes, and went up and balanced to gentlemen, who quickly clasped them to their hearts and swept wildly off. And then the gentlemen (not to be outdone) formed their parties of three, and fell upon such ladies as they could conveniently catch, and whirled them about, this way and that, till every curl acquired a distinct vibration. When the ribbons were produced, and everybody was mysteriously tied to somebody else, what fun it was to see the very tall lady dance off with the very short gentleman-looking tenderly upon the top of his head. And then to see the tall gentleman, who appeared to be sitting upon air, in painful effort to adapt his stature to that of the short lady. What sport, too, to observe the anguish written upon the countenances of those unpractised in the dance-you would have thought them engaged in the study of spherical trigonometry at the very least. Though, perhaps, after all, you would have found more amusement in observing two or three gentlemen who didn't dance well-but thought they did. The smile of perfect satisfaction that rested upon their faces as they trotted about quite independently of their partners, and bumped pleasantly against their neighbors, revived one's faith in the original innocence of humanity. At last we got to that part of the exhibition where the ladies arrange themselves on one side of the room, and the gentlemen on the other, and, at a given signal, rush into a grand embrace. And here is always a general change of partners-so that I found myself turning about Kate Wherrey at one end of the room, while Bessy and Horripitts polked upon my uncle's boots at the other. Then, quick as thought, we changed our positions, and were just charging violently at Mr. Barnard, when my aunt suddenly stopped, exclaiming that her shoe-string had broken, and another must be got to supply its place; so she tripped lightly out of the room, leaving me stranded hard by the bewildered Major. 
                  "Tom, Tom," gravely began my uncle (I confess the quiet sadness of his voice made me feel a little unpleasantly), "I never thought to see you concerned in such business as this. I never thought you could have permitted such an exhibition to take place under this roof. That picture that hangs opposite the mirror was my mother, and your grandmother, Tom;-it was in this very room she collected her family to hear the precepts of that pure Teacher by whom I verily believe she is now accepted. How can I dare to pray that she may still be near me, and hallow with the benediction of her presence this old house that she loved so well, when it has been disgraced by such-. 
                  Tom, I will not speak the words that rise to my lips, lest they should seem too harsh to you-to-to her-whom I have promised to respect and to love-but-I am grieved, Tom, I am sorely grieved." 
                  I had been prepared for a little amazement on the part of my uncle, and had thought how I could rally him upon having had no such good thing in his younger days; but the simple dignity of his manner quite destroyed my purposed batteries, and threw me wholly upon the defensive. 
                  "My dear sir," said I, "you consider this matter far too seriously. It is only because the dance is new to you that you are so unfavorably impressed. Believe me, you, like all the rest of the world, would soon get over this squeamishness. Do you not see the three Miss Drachmas, daughters of the Rev. Doctor Drachma, whose sermon against the licentious rites of the Mormons you admired so much-why, they are the crack dancers of Bear-brook, and Miss Fanny has been pouting all the evening because Horripitts didn't ask her to lead." 
                  "If this German had been invented twenty years ago," observed Mr. Barnard, "it would have spared me one sleepless night. I have not forgotten the evening when, after years of silent devotion-of anxious endeavor to render myself less unworthy the affection of a noble and modest woman-I was allowed the privilege accorded to none before-to none after-of holding a trembling hand in mine, of clasping a delicate waist, that seemed to shrink even from him whom the heart beneath had chosen. Oh! I well remember the night of happy, grateful wakefulness which I passed;-but I don't think the thrill would have lasted quite so long, if I had seen the same familiarity permitted to every idle dissipated fellow who kept up such small modicum of worldly respectability as is necessary to gain admittance to a fashionable ball. No, no, sir; such a public rehearsal would have removed all feeling of especial favor from a more private performance." 
                  "You are very unreasonable, sir," I exclaimed (I could talk to Barnard in a way that I should not have been willing to do to my uncle); "you are both unreasonable and unjust, to condemn those very young ladies, who, coming on to the stage, find this established outlet for the exuberant desire for life and motion that belongs to youth. For nature that would 'cadence her joy of strength,' no more graceful manifestation is at! present appointed. To repress all such impulse cannot be expected. Believe me, we shall do better than in searching after a moral alchemy to turn rose-buds and lilies into wall-flowers before their time." 
                   
                  "I condemn no one," replied Mr. Barnard, somewhat warmly; "but perhaps you will allow me to respect those ladies (of whom there are more than you seem to think) who are willing to give up the prestige of fashionable position, rather than submit to familiarities which nothing but an abominable custom can for a moment sanctify. I do not urge that it is against a young lady that she suffers herself to be whirled about in this German night after night; but this I do declare, that (in View of all that is given up) it is something very strongly in any woman's favor that she does not." 
                  "I agree with my friend. Barnard," observed my uncle, "in being unwilling to speak harshly of young people who thoughtlessly fall into improprieties that are countenanced by those who should know better. But my charity is not sufficiently elastic to cover Doctor and Mrs. Drachma, and the dozen fathers and mothers who lead our society in Bearbrook, whose word could at once put a stop to this indecorous exhibition, and introduce in its stead some of the old and unexceptionable dances in which all could join without sacrifice of self-respect." 
                  "You are quite right, Major," said Mr. B.; "there are, in every society, some dozen or twenty matrons, at whose command the waves of any fashionable frivolity could at once be stayed. And these-by refusing to allow their daughters to join in what offends the taste and judgment of many people whose feelings deserve respect-could effectually banish this degrading exhibition to places where it property belongs." 
                  What more was said on this disputed topic I did not hear, for Bessie Wacklestead (just at this point) ran up to take me out. So out I went, and was soon rebaptized in the fellowship of the German;-yet I confess with an abatement of my former spirit. There was a something that grated against my feelings when I saw Kate again embraced by Horripitts-who, although, he can lead a German, is a man whose morals and habits are notoriously bad. And although I did not so much object to tenderly pilot the fair Bessie about the room-yet when I was obliged to resign my place to Ned Hurcus, something like an expostulation rose to my lips. 
                  Well, a German does not last for ever (although the worthy papas who are obliged to sit it out might not agree with this proposition), and ours was pleasantly interrupted by the arrival of the huge bowl of cranberry punch that was always brewed in honor of the occasion, and which gave an agreeable diversion to the thoughts and conversation of the party. 
                  For, if any human weakness clung to gentlemen of such violent virtue as Mr. Barnard and my uncle, I believe it lay in the direction of punch. And this fascinating monosyllable, as defined by the authorities of Bearbrook, meant no weak mixture, two-sixths sherry, sugar and lemon, and four-sixths water-but a compound of Which good honest rum-and enough of it, too-was the basis; from which arose satisfactory layers of port, cordial and Bordeaux-with just a touch of gin to give it a flavor, and a few cranberries, floating upon the top, to give it a name. 
                  The Major and Mr. Barnard were provided with two soup-ladles, by means of which instruments they dispensed the refreshing beverage to the company. The continual demand, however, that was made upon their attention, left little opportunity for a personal indulgence-until Barnard (who was something of a scholar) providentially recollected that the class of men existing in classical times, known as dispensatores vini adusti saccharo aqua et limonis-whose duties seem to have been very similar to those of the punch-helpers of our own day-were solemnly lemnly commanded to drink with every individual who required their services. This excellent and laudable custom the Major and his friend declared should not become obsolete through the culpable neglect of the modern representatives of so honorable a body; and I am bound to say that the ghost of the most rigid "dispensator" could have tipped out no censure to his scrupulous successors. 
                  After we all had drank enough to experience that pleasant glow that cranberries, taken in this peculiar form, never fail to impart to the human system-some one proposed a moonlight walk in the long avenue before the house. The suggestion was considered most happy; and the ladies ran off to get their bonnets and shawls, and the gentlemen groped under the great sofas in the entry in search of their coats and hats-and soon everybody was ready to set forth. 
                  Everybody, except the distinguished individuals who had so ably discharged the honors of the punch, for, just as all were about to start, the question suddenly occurred to the classic brain of Mr. Barnard, whether the ancient dispensatores were not required to drink up such portions of the vinum adustum as was unconsumed by the company. My uncle at once decided that, if there was any doubt on the point, it would be highly improper to peril the perfect observance of the ritual, by an omission so serious. Accordingly, the two gentlemen resumed their places at the table-charged their glasses heavily from the great bowl between them-and thus we left them behind us. 
                  And, now, my account of this little party is over. It was far brighter and heartier in reality than I have the skill to make it upon paper-and perhaps far brighter to me than it would have been to the reader. For my own days of merriment are very few, and on that account this simple country meeting (although it takes place in October) seems a very carnival. And I take quite as much pleasure in it, as you find in your great dinners in the Fifth Avenue, or at the wax-lighted japonica-hung chambers of your costly festivities. 
                  How fairly shone the glorious moon that night on the rich dress of Autumn! The curled leaves cracked beneath our feet, as Kate and I left the main party, and walked beneath the mighty pines which skirt the river's side. And now, I feel what an innovation I countenance in hinting that a nephew could presume to advise his aunt. But if you had an aunt of the years, and in the position of Kate Wherrey, I believe you would have done as I did. 
                  And what I did do was to remind the impulsive young creature who hung upon my arm, of the respect she owed to the opinions, and even to the prejudices, of the man whom she had taken for better and for worse. Then, I told her how shocked my uncle had been with her favorite German-and what Mr. Barnard had said about it-and how my own sense of propriety forced me to agree with them, almost against my will. 
                  "My dear Tom," replied my aunt, and her fair, dark eyes were moistened as she spoke, "I believe I have been very thoughtless-that my conduct is attributable to nothing worse, I am sure you will not doubt. I have been left too much to myself, and have thought less than I should of the pleasure and convenience of others. While I am mistress at Bearbrook, the Major and his really excellent friend shall never be shocked by a repetition of the frolic of to-night; and, Tom, will not you, who are the only friend of my own age to whose judgment I can appeal-will you not tell me when you think me wrong? and believe that I wish, and try, to do what is right." 
                   
                  Those who saw the cheerful and pretty ways with which my aunt presided at the dinner-table, or the lightness and seductive grace with which she swept through the waltz, must have admired her-but, if any one had stood beside us that night, and had heard all the real feeling and womanly tenderness that poured from a heart ordinarily absorbed in the trivialities of the passing hour, he would have loved her as I did, and do.
                   
                  It was some time before we returned to the house; and finally, as we passed along the plank walk, that passed over the marshes where the cranberries grew-not a word was spoken. The moon not only clad familiar objects with unearthly garments, but sent fantastic shadows to wander in the solemn chambers of the mind. 
                  "I know not why we have been silent so long," said Kate, as we entered the porch, "but I have been dreaming over impossibilities-strange and wild ones, too-I know it is very foolish; but it is a way of mine, and I cannot help it." 
                  "Nay, nay, dear Kate," I replied, "we may be all the better for such visions; for I have a strong suspicion that those who never dream, have never truly lived." 
                
             
             
                
               V. TOLLIWOTTE'S GHOST. 
               A REMINISCENCE OF BEARBROOK. 
               I LOVE an old house. There is something soothing and friendly in its very decay. The dampness that hangs about the parlors, the cracks twisting through the yellow ceiling, and the fearless mice that scratch and scamper behind the wainscot, afford me a satisfaction I never feel in the modern monuments of newly-acquired wealth and vulgar taste, which are fast superseding the solid, comfortable mansions of the last century. 
               To fulfil its whole duty, your old house must have a ghost and a pretty woman to live in it. But alas, for the backsliding of the present! We may moan as we will over the weak eyes and pulmonary disorders that beset men and women-but the degeneration of ghosts is a real affliction. 
               I knew what would come of it when spectres took to Webster, and spelt their final syllable t-e-r. Who would be afraid of such a spectre as that-or what could he have to communicate that would be at all worth hearing? We should naturally expect such a fellow to exhibit himself for fifty cents (private sittings one dollar), and then deluge us with his awkward flattery and commonplace morality. 
               But a good honest ghost, who lives in a sober way in a quiet house in the country, commands my entire respect. 
                
               He has positively no connexion with these vagrant apparitions who are flying about the land-visiting circles here and there-making their ghastly jokes, preaching their feeble homilies, and blowing their tin fish-horns into the ears of sceptics. No, no, our old-fashioned aristocratic ghost (that it does a man good to believe in) has a hearty contempt for these nomadic impostors. There he lives in his little windy attic, or mopes about his damp cellar, and dreams of the good old times when he used to clank his chain about the house, and frighten the straggler who went upstairs to get a book, or make the little group in the parlor stir the fire and draw more closely together as they heard his solemn tramp in the hall. What thrilling interest gathered about his communications when, after years of awful suspense, he deigned to indicate the old well where he had sunk his treasure, or revealed (in the strictest confidence) the precise individual who had defrauded you out of your rightful inheritance, and the steps that should be taken for its recovery. 
               Such a ghost as that was worth knowing. Give me one old-fashioned scholarly phantom, who must be talked to in Latin, who appears at the canonical hour of midnight, and, above all, who is content to remain a permanent fixture in your house-and I will resign right, title, and interest, in all and singular tippers, rappers, and trumpeters, that new revelation or old imposture can conjure up. 
               I believe that Major Wherrey values the highly respectable Shade who is said to haunt those queer old attic passages that twist in and out under the roof of the Bear-brook mansion, quite as much as any of his more tangible possessions. 
               "My dear Tom," he used to say to me, "at the present day I know of but one criterion by which to examine the claims of our fashionable neighbors to the social position which they claim. The time was, to be sure, when if a man kept a carriage with his arms painted on the door, and a sober coachman to drive him about town, you might have known he was of gentle descent, and had a goodly company of ancestors to vouch for him. But now everything is changed-carriages are kept by people whose fathers drove them, and arms have their market value, and may be purchased of any engraver. There is, however, one thing the rogues cannot counterfeit. So, when you have any doubt of the antiquity and consequent respectability of a dashing family, ask, not if they keep their groom or their coup, but whether they keep their ghost-and if they don't, depend upon it they are not what they pretend to be." 
               The last time that my uncle thus delivered himself was a year ago last fast-day. Mr. Barnard, Kate, and myself, were lounging easily before the fire (we had just come in damp and sleepy from a lyceum lecture) listening to the strange murmurs of the wind as it rattled the tin spout that passed under the eaves, or wandering about the large chimneys, groaned its solemn requiem over all the glowing hearths and sunny faces that had once beamed upon the oak panelling of the parlor where we sat-and then passed out into the darkness. 
               "I think we must have another back-log," remarked Mr. Barnard, who was standing in a "gentlemanly attitude" before the fire, and gazing out into the room with his usual complacency. "I don't feel like going to bed after that strong coffee that Mrs. Wherrey made for the Sunday-school children." 
               "Not for the children but for their teachers," interposed my aunt in correction. "I don't know why it is that Doctor Drachma's sewing-circle should drink their tea and coffee so very strong; but as long as they get it at other places, I must have it so here." 
               "The old excuse, that would continue every evil in the world," rejoined Barnard. "How fortunate it is there are some people brave enough to act up to their notions of right, without reference to the dicta of the little community with whom fortune has thrown them. Old absurdities, aye, and old iniquities too, linger on the scene when the world is really tired of them, merely because no one has the courage to rise up and-push them off." 
               "But this hardly applies to the use of stimulants or narcotics." 
               "Perhaps not-even if we include in the latter class the lecture we have listened to this evening-the world has not yet outgrown coffee or lyceums, and we may vainly look for such millennium. But there are, nevertheless, many things in which we are prepared for reform, if some one would only begin it. Take, for instance, this very Sunday-school system whose practical workings have been exhibited this afternoon. What possible good can come of such questions as this (I take the first one I see on opening the text-book)-For what are the rats of the East famous?" 
               "For-the-length-of-their-tails-and-the-speed-of-their-running,"-responded my aunt, admirably mimicking the false emphasis and hurried utterance with which children rattle off the information they have learned by rote. 
               "Very well," said Barnard; "now if I were to vary the question a little, and ask you what eastern animal was celebrated for speed and tail, the chances are that you would be utterly perplexed, and complain that there was no such question in the book. Indeed I tried the experiment this afternoon by puzzling a poor little girl who-before Doctor Drachma could well pronounce the question tion-What has the camel sometimes been called?-fluently responded-The ship of the desert. But when I asked her what animal had sometimes been called the ship of the desert, the dear little thing was terribly confused, began to cry, and rather thought it was an eastern rat.' 
               "I cannot think Sunday-schools particularly desirable for the class of children to be found in Doctor Drachma's congregation," remarked the Major. "They are made to supersede that home instruction and example which the parents are fully able to give, and without which all public teaching seems a very empty pretence. Of course for the children of the poor and illiterate, it is a very different matter. I always subscribe most heartily to any plan for dispensing religious instruction among them-and tried my best to persuade Kate to teach in one of the ragged schools during our last winter in New York." 
               "Good!" said Mr. Barnard. "I wish you better success next year; though if you use Drachma's catechism I should certainly advise some additions by way of appendix. Why, I should like to know, is it necessary to keep the rising generation posted up concerning eastern rats, to the exclusion of eastern cranberries? Let us hear how some oriental Sir Joseph Banks undertook to grow cranberries in Palestine, and how inferior they were to those produced by Major Wherrey at Bearbrook." 
               As any joke touching the precious vegetable production, to the cultivation of which my uncle had devoted so much time and study, was seldom well received-my aunt judged it best to prevent a reply, by sending me into the hall to bring in the back-log that Mr. Barnard had coveted. "I told John he might go and see his cousin at Piccochee to-night," she remarked in explanation, "and as to-morrow is my washing-day, the Women have gone to bed long ago-so we must help ourselves." 
                
               "I am most happy to be of service," said I, advancing to the door, "though I must question John's devotion to his cousin, for his cowhide boots have certainly been wandering about the entry ever since we came home." 
               "And by the uncertainty of their movement I should say that John had been drowning his loves or his sorrows in some of his master's punch," drily observed Mr. Barnard. 
               As I passed out of the room, we all heard a heavy sound, as of some one falling at full length upon the painted canvas floor-cloth;-but nothing was to be seen. The great hall stove threw its dull red light on nothing save the picture of old Judge Wherrey in his wig and gown, and the stiff chair, glittering bravely with its brass-headed nails, that he used to sit upon when on earth. 
               "John! John!" exclaimed my aunt, hurrying after me, and peering upon every square inch of the floor, as if John was a beetle that she feared to crush-"Why, bless me, Major, the man is not here!" 
               "No," said my uncle very calmly, "I knew he wasn't there. I could have told you what it was at once-only I was afraid we should offend it, and it would go off. This is very pleasant I am really much gratified." 
               "And who or what in the name of wonder do all these its refer to," exclaimed Barnard. "Is it a dog or a monkey that has been making himself so audible?" 
               "Oh! neither," said my uncle very quietly; "it is only--old Tolliwotte's ghost." 
               "A ghost!" screamed my aunt, and threw herself into my arms for protection-"Oh! you horrid, abominable Major-to bring me to this haunted old rat-trap, and then invite ghosts to board, and say you're glad when they come. Oh! dear, dear, where shall I go?" 
               Upon consideration it struck Mrs. Kate that she might as well stay where she was-a decision to which I had no manner of objection. Indeed, my faith waxed strong in a spiritual manifestation which could give such a comfortable proof of its reality. Dick Horripitts says (although rather more coarsely) that it is good fun to support a pretty girl while dancing the German; but, for my part, I think it is much better fun to do it standing still. And I earnestly counsel those whose business it is to look after such matters, to consider whether a new figure introducing this slight improvement might not be generally popular. 
               We hurried back into the parlor-I, with a log under each arm, and Kate (being or pretending to be very much frightened) clinging to my skirts-or rather to the garment that fulfils their purpose in a masculine wardrobe. There is surely nothing more taking than to see a pretty woman feign excessive timidity; but then she must be really pretty to carry it off-and I cannot recommend one who is not to try so doubtful an experiment. My aunt, however, is quite handsome enough to do as she pleases in this and all other respects-and I am sure you would have fanned, and salted, and soothed her quite as zealously as Barnard and I did, had you happened in at the crisis. 
               "And who was old Tolliwotte, and what business has his ghost here?" inquired Barnard, when our fair patient was in a condition approaching convalescence. 
               "Colonel Tolliwotte"-responded my uncle, in the precise and measured tone of a man who has a story to tell, and who knows it-"Colonel Tolliwotte was the ancestor of Captain Simon Tolliwotte, who owns the farm just over the river. He is described by one of his contemporaries as 'a man who did picke out a way to thrive in grace, and had much power of godliness to the fattening of lean churches.' He is also mentioned as 'one who loved well Our New England Ordinances, and ever veered his tongue against foreigne ladies, ape-headed pullets, and all fashions.' These unprofitable classes of society he seems to have dosed with a composition the old chronicler calls 'syrrope of reformation;' but his most famous exploits were against the Indians, of whom it is related that' he did often lull as many as six after supper, and was greatly disciplinated in grace.' It can hardly be surprising that a gentleman of such singular accomplishment should have captivated the affections of Dorcas Wherrie, the daughter of old Retribution Wherrie, who built this house. I have never been able to ascertain any particulars concerning their courtship; but the melancholy event that brought it to a conclusion is vividly depicted by contemporaneous authority. It seems that poor Tolliwotte went out one evening to take his customary diversion with the Indians-and promised to call upon Dorcas on his way home. He did call; but the hapless lady never had so unwelcome a visitor. In fact, the savages had at last got the better of him, and he entered the house scalped (that was no great matter, for he wore a wig), and pierced with several disagreeable instruments in several vital parts of his body. He staggered about the hall for some time-just as we have heard those mysterious boots do this evening-and finally fell with a crash-just such a crash, Tom, as we heard when you opened the door-and lay bathed in blood at the feet of his own Dorcas." 
               My uncle paused for a moment, to give due effect to this dismal picture, and thus continued:- 
               "Ever since that day there has been a tradition in our family that the Colonel was in the habit of returning to earth to rehearse the painful scene with which his life terminated. Indeed, the truth of this story was placed beyond a doubt by the testimony of my grandfather, who, upon returning one evening from a supper-party at the tavern, actually surprised the Colonel, Miss Dorcas, and old Retribution, going through their affecting exhibition in the front entry. Of late years, since the house has been more open to the world, I regret to say that this interesting party have been forced to hold their meetings in the attic, where they have much annoyed my cooks-who cannot be made to understand the great privilege of entertaining such aristocratic company. But the little event of this evening gives me good hopes that they have returned to the original scene of their sufferings, and that they will continue to repeat their satisfactory, though somewhat melancholy, performances every evening during the season." 
               "It seems strange," observed Barnard, "that these ghosts should always wish to go over their most painful experiences when on earth. One would certainly suppose that the Colonel would prefer to repeat the felicitous moment, when he arose from his knees the accepted lover of Dorcas, or when he had the luck to bag a brace of Indians at a shot. But this seems to be characteristic of all manifestations, ancient and modern. I have seen mediums thrown into all sorts of convulsions to represent the final moments of the spirits who professed to animate them." 
               "I think it is almost sacrilege," said my uncle, "to mention these authentic and respectable apparitions in the same breath with an imposture so transparent and silly as modern spiritualism." 
               "You speak like one who has not examined the matter, but is ready to take up the cry of the street or press about a subject of which he is wholly uninformed," retorted Mr. Barnard. "Spiritualism may be, and in my opinion is, a delusion; but an imposture it certainly is not. The alleged phenomena, though in many cases exaggerated and distorted, do undoubtedly take place. And we have no right to call our neighbor weak or silly, because his mind is convinced by evidence that fails to satisfy our own. I am acquainted with many spiritualists, as I am with many Catholics and Calvinists, whose peculiar tenets of faith I can by no means accept, yet upon whose judgment and information in indifferent matters I have the greatest reliance. Nay, more; I can feel the highest respect for men who are brave enough to advocate what they conceive to be the truth, undeterred by loss of social caste or the jeers and mockery with which the world always receives those who seek its improvement in any novel or unauthorized way." 
               "Well! I shall hear of you as a confirmed believer in all these signs and wonders. When people begin to talk so about it, they soon come boldly up to the mark, and swallow any absurdity a diseased imagination can invent." 
               "I will not say that I shall never be converted to spiritualism, because, with a certain amount of evidence, I believe I could be converted to that, or anything else. But I will say this-that after having carefully read every book of any note devoted to the advocacy of the new revelation-after having done a goodly amount of that "investigating" for which spiritualists clamor so loudly-I am infinitely further from believing, than I was before beginning my inquiries. And this is not because I have not seen many instances of that clairvoyant thought-reading which must be accepted as an established fact, but-Well, it is not worth while to detail all my reasons just now, and just here, so they shall be kept for some long morning, when you ask for them." 
               "It is very strange we have hot had the spirits here yet," said my Uncle. "They had a great run at South Wexford and Ponkussett; but they seem to have skipped Bearbrook." 
               "They will be upon you some time or other when you least expect them," rejoined Barnard. "The whole town will be thrown into a state of furious excitement. People will abandon their business and their pleasure and tip the tables from morning to night. Doctor Drachma will preach a series of sermons against it, and five or six families will become indignant and sell their pews. One or two people may possibly become insane from over-excitement-and then the epidemic will gradually pass off like the small-pox or yellow-fever, and the world will go on very much as before. I have seen matters take precisely this course in more places than one." 
               "Well, well, all is, whenever we are favored, I shall expect you and Tom to come down here. Your experience will be of infinite use in interrogating our visitors." 
               We both promised the Major that we would certainly come, and were about to expatiate on the satisfaction we should take in such a visit, when my aunt, with an exclamation of terror, called our attention to a mysterious singing, that appeared to come from the cellar immediately beneath us. 
               "Doubtless it is one of the men chopping wood," said the Major. 
               "It can be no man" exclaimed my aunt, "for I locked the cellar-door and have the key in my pocket. I knew that John would be out to-night and did not think it was best to leave it open." 
               "It can surely be no ghost," said Barnard, "for I never heard of one who sang, except the ombre di Nino in Semiramide." 
               "Be still a minute, and let us try to distinguish the words," urged the Major. "If it has any connexion with the apparitions of this evening, it will doubtless be some old Gregorian chant." 
               "Du dar, du dar," sang the voice beneath; "I went to the race with a pocket full of tin, but soon come back with my hat knocked in. Oh, du dar da." 
               "Why, good gracious, it's old Netleswing," cried my aunt. "He must have been locked up there all the afternoon. Why doesn't he knock to get out?" 
               "Du dar, du dar," ascended in reply. 
               "Somebody ought to go and let him up," said Kate-and she looked hard at me. "I'm sure I can never go through that entry again!" 
               "And I can never find the cellar-door alone," I responded. "Among all those queer, dark passages that lead out of the kitchen, I should not discover the right one in a twelvemonth." 
               "Suppose we all go in a body," advised Barnard; "we shall then be able to defy Tolliwotte, even if he brings all his Indians along with him." 
               The Major thought the suggestion a good one, and volunteered to lead the forlorn hope as bearer of the astral lamp. Barnard and myself marched as aides-de-camp to my aunt; and in this order we passed into the entry. 
               "I don't see any blood," said my uncle, pausing to examine the pattern of the floor-cloth. "It would have been very satisfactory if Tolliwotte could have left a few drops-just to show that it was really him." 
               "Perhaps he is coming back to supply the omission," said Barnard. "There is certainly a most extraordinary blowing and scraping at the other end of the entry." 
               We stood aghast as the mysterious sounds alluded to struck our ears; and my aunt very nearly fainted, as a square portion of the floor a few feet from where we stood rose from its place, and admitted a bushel basket of cranberries berries into the hall. The cranberries were followed by the head and shoulders of Mr. Netleswing, who was gradually continued, until we surveyed a pair of cowhide boots, very similar to those Colonel Tolliwotte must have had on during his last interview with Dorcas. 
               "Well, now, who would ha' thought o' this?" said Netleswing, rather startled at finding so many spectators to his ascent. "Why, Lord bless me, I thought you'd all gone to lectur' and carr'd off the cellar key, so I've been tuggin' at this pesky old trap-door that hasn't been used for mor'n twenty year, just to get at them cranberries, that wanted pickin' over like all time. Cranberries, I s'pose you know, Mr. Tom, when they're just a little mite touched and can't keep, is about the most fattenin' thing for hogs there is a-going. Why, them sars'ges sent down to you last November were made out o' cranberry-fed pork, and they were just-well; I'll say they couldn't be beat, nohow!" 
               The mysterious steps, the crash (possibly the trap-door as it descended over the head of Mr. Netleswing), admit a certain sort of explanation. But if the reader is willing to accept that explanation, and give up Dorcas and her lover, and old Retribution, for Netleswing and a basket of cranberries-he is not the man I take him to be. When Barnard attempted to account for the curious phenomena of the evening in some such manner, we treated him with the contempt he deserved. 
               A gentleman interested in spiritual literature borrowed my uncle's note-book, and prepared and published an elaborate account of the whole matter; though I feel it my duty to correct two slight errors that have crept into his otherwise authentic narrative, by assuring the reader that at no period of the evening was the Major sustained in the atmosphere, and that Barnard did not mount a table ble, and gallop furiously about the room. In every other respect, I am most happy to corroborate the little work in question, and so commend it to the perusal of all candid inquirers. 
             
             
                
               VI. PROFESSOR PHANTILLO. 
               A ROMANCE OF THE WATER-CURE. 
                
                  CHAPTER I. 
                  PROFESSOR PHANTILLO was, and I presume still is, an astrologer. His advertisements, which ornamented the newspapers a year ago, told the public in what esteem he was held by the kings and potentates of the old world, who consulted him on all important occasions with astonishing success. Why this favorite of royalty should wish to establish himself in the shire-town of Bearbrook in New England-or why his august disciples should suffer him to come, if he did-were questions to which the advertisements aforementioned afforded no response. 
                  The particular service rendered by this illustrious stranger to my uncle, Major Wherrey, being rather paternal than astrological in its character, need be preceded by no inquiry concerning the claims of that occult science which yet finds many dupes in the midst of our boasted enlightenment. 
                  Now, my uncle, Major Wherrey, was a very thin gentleman, with queer little eyes and still droller mouth-not at all like the engraving of the picture in possession of the Bearbrook High Art Association, which serves (or should serve) as frontispiece to the history. A constitutional shyness-or, as he chose to call it, an elegant fastidiousness-prevented my uncle from relishing the society of ladies; so that his forty-second birthday found him in celibacy, and chambered in the city of New York. 
                  Of the particular nature of the festivities that distinguished this annual commemoration, I am unfortunately ignorant-never having been invited to assist thereat; and, as the present narrative has only to do with facts, I decline consulting my fancy, or even the doctrine of probabilities, for a sketch of the occasion. 
                  It is sufficient to conclude the introductory chapter (which, in my opinion, should be devoted to telling the reader who people are-whether they figure immediately or not) with a statement to the following effect. The morning succeeding the Major's party found him prostrated and headachy upon a sofa, endeavoring to extract some comfort from the columns of a weekly journal. 
                  "The very thing, by Jove!" exclaimed my uncle, as he read an advertisement headed, "Granville County Water-Cure." 
                  "The very thing! I'll go immediately!" 
                
                
                  CHAPTER II. 
                  A WRITER who is concise and intelligible in the first chapter, has surely earned the right to a little episodical description in the second-of which allowed title advantage is thus taken. 
                  A water-cure! Who does not remember the mixture of surprise and incredulity with which he first heard the name! What sexagenarian invalid does not recall the glow caused by the first reading of Bulwer's panegyric upon the new remedial agent! An unhappy man he was, if his literary cravings happened to take him to the Medical Reviews after having perused this delicious publication. In their conservative pages, he found the professors of the new art placed in the same category with the proprietors of all-healing sarsaparillas or vegetable pills. 
                  The short dream of a perfect restoration to all bodily and mental vigor-that fair palace of perpetual health-that the brilliant novelist had conjured up, was suddenly assailed by the harsh words, "humbug," "self-delusion," "quackery," and such other vituperative missives as the professional batteries afforded. 
                  Yet, in spite of the extravagant laudations of enthusiasts, and the vigorous attacks of opponents, the establishments for the practice of the new system have steadily increased among us; till the discovery of Priessnitz, with certain modifications, is almost universally allowed to be of service in many cases of chronic disorder. 
                  It is hardly just, however, to attribute the number and thriving condition of the hydropathic institutions by which we are surrounded, to the wonders wrought by the simple agency of water. A great part of their success is doubtless owing to the love of that easy, independent intercourse with one another, which crowds Saratoga and Newport, and has made the "boarding-house" an American institution. There is always an excuse for passing a few weeks at a water-cure, which must be inconveniently stretched to apply to Fabiaria's, or the Mountain House at Catskill, To the former we are driven, not by inclination, but misfortune. A gentleman's business connections have no cause to complain-a lady's household duties may with propriety be left to take care of themselves-when the great necessity of health demand their absence. 
                  There are other circumstances that make these establishments a favorite retreat for a large class of our restless population. The moderate cost of such a sojourn in some pleasant part of the country, in comparison with a visit to the Lakes or Niagara-the complete absolution from the daily penance of dressing-and, above all, the perfect equality in the state and position of each occupant-are, to the great mass of migratory citizens, very positive advantages. 
                  "Why, the fact is," says young Wilkinson (he who lost so heavily a few years ago, by the failure of a noted firm in this city), "the fact is, that at Newport, where I formerly passed the season, I should now be positively nobody! There are plenty of fellows whose kids and broadcloth, not to speak of turn-outs, it would be impossible for me to equal; whereas, by going through the water-cure, I can flourish and flirt in dressing-gown and slippers, and get up quite as pleasant an understanding with a damsel in a calico morning-gown, with hair damp and dishevelled by frequent ablutions, as if we were mutually booted and laced in the most orthodox pattern," 
                  The recent visit of my uncle to one of the most famous of these establishments, has given me a particularity of information concerning the details of water-cure life, that, under other circumstances, could only be attained by a personal residence. It has always been a habit of Major Wherrey to keep a daily diary, to the end that should he by some unforeseen event blaze into notoriety, there may not be wanting the materials for a biography sufficiently copious to satisfy his warmest admirer. A great amount of blotted manuscript was recently presented me by the good gentleman, accompanied by the same friendly permission with which people who have been restored to health by some elixir or cordial, conclude their certificates-namely, that they might be put to any use likely to benefit the proprietor. 
                  From these inky fountains, the stream of this narrative derives its source-some tributaries may help to increase its body-but the main supplies I here openly acknowledge. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER III. 
                  A FAVORABLE, first impression is of acknowledged importance in reconciling us to places or people. 
                  In our younger days we may, indeed, recover from the shock of seeing a fine view in a thunder-storm, or of failing to recognise some shabby little gentleman as the favorite poet, whose intellectual visage had beamed at us from the first page of his published productions. But in mature life, the loss of impulse is supplied by the comparative duration of the feeling excited; and it must be regarded as a happy circumstance when a middle-aged bachelor, an imaginary or real invalid, on arriving at the place where he has idetermined to make a considerable stay, discovers that matters are reasonably to his liking. 
                  Such a satisfaction did my uncle experience on reaching the Granville County Water-Cure. The house, to be sure, had rather a patched effect, for nearly every water-cure was originally designed for something else, and had been through various processes of enlargement and adaptation. But the inside seemed quiet and cheerful, and looked remarkably unlike a hotel. The existence of any peculiar aquatic privileges would never have been suspected by a transient visitor; for baths of every description were banished to the cellar, where they kept company with an immense tank, whose calm dark surface was strongly suggestive of mosquitoes. 
                  Whether these annoying insects were actually generated in this lower region could never be fully determined; but that they appeared upstairs in goodly numbers, is a fact concerning which my uncle is peculiarly positive. 
                  The chambers were small and low, as they must necessarily be where many are to be accommodated-but the architect, with the view of providing a sufficiency of oxygen, as well as mitigating the evils of solitude, placed ventilators over all the doors, by which means my kinsman was kept pleasantly informed of the affairs of his neighbors, and listened to many profitable strictures upon himself. 
                  It is not until the first breakfast that the stranger sees the full corps of patients among whom he is to take his place. Then, they all enter fresh and rosy from an early walk, where has been dispersed that silent misanthropy which usually characterizes the first hour after rising. 
                  There is certainly a republican mixture of the different varieties of the human race. The pale and the florid, the fastidious and the gossiping, the judge, the colonel, and the author, all mingle together as the black and white spirits are instructed to do about the witches' cauldron. Among the ladies the variety is no less striking. First, there is the pleasant, chatty little person, whose toilet, manners, and conversation, may be described by the newspaper phrase, "very neat." Opposite are several damsels of the intensely natural and unaffected school. These are the young ladies who are afraid of nobody, despise all sentiment, and can talk about fast horses and fancy drinks. Next, come, some representatives of a different order, who manage to smile a little, occasionally screw up their courage sufficiently to ask for the butter, and secretly envy the ease and volubility of their neighbors. Besides these, there is a dowager, who sparkles with breast-pins and showy rings, and a young lady or two, who, not being patients, and consequently allowed to rise when they please, steal to their places with that guilty look that the consciousness of having overslept oneself invariably occasions. 
                  The breakfast itself is always plain, though exceedingly good; yet my uncle sees fit to express his private distaste for a dark, husky mixture, which might pass for the species of provender upon which the prodigal son was tempted to regale in the hour of necessity, and which is handed about under the name of "cracked wheat." 
                  sFrom the memoranda made during the first few days of his sojourn, it is conjectured that my uncle's visit began in a manner by no means disagreeable. The day was spent in bathing and walking; and, until the walkers and bathers had narrated the principal events in their past lives, and told when they had come, and how long they meant to stay-there seems to have been little lack of diversion. 
                  The end of the week, however, brought with it the time that must come sooner or later, when our companions began to repeat the same observations in the same way, and we feel that consciousness of having seen to the bottom of one another's minds, which Goldsmith urged as a good reason for admitting new members to the Literary Club. 
                  The "new members" in the present instance were not attainable-either the proper season had not arrived, or the advertisements and billiard tables of rival establishments succeeded in attracting the crowd. The daily routine seemed to drag a little heavily, except when enlivened by some expedition, which, out of the many talked about, happened actually to take place. 
                  Of this description of entertainment the grand ascent of Squaticub Hill alone deserves a notice. 
                  A barouche, accompanied by several buggies, contained the pleasure-seekers. One of these latter vehicles, and a very talkative young lady (who, to prevent anything like embarrassment, at once informed her companion that she never intended to be married), were bestowed upon my uncle. The prospect from various parts of the road was said to be remarkably fine, and was, perhaps, enjoyed by the proprietor of the fast horse; but the less favored individuals who were enveloped in the dust occasioned by the performance of this favorite animal, were obliged to rely on their imaginations for its various beauties. The fair friend who took charge of Major Wherrey, was by no means of a careful or timorous disposition, and insisted upon hurrying on at the greatest speed, in a fruitless endeavor to obtain the lead. The result was, that, when at last the summit of the hill was attained, my uncle's eyes were full of very fine gravel, and his black broadcloth suit turned to that peppered-salt color, which the tailors assure us makes up into "neat business-coats." Nor did the hue seem particularly inappropriate to the party;-whose general appearance was more suggestive of "business" than anything else-for how could it be supposed that pleasure would induce people to climb a high hill, to sit in the scorching rays of the sun, for the purpose of drinking wretched lemonade, and looking at nothing in particular. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER IV. 
                  
                     "PROFESSOR PHANTILLO, having recently arrived from Germany, where he was constantly consulted by the principal crowned heads of Europe, gives the most satisfactory advice in all matters connoted with Love, Courtship, or Marriage. For the sum of two dollars (post-paid, and addressed to Bearbook brook, Mass), he covenants to teach any lady or gentleman the art of being irresistibly fascinating; and, for an adequate fee, will insure partners to the most fastidious.
                     "iseoptf."
                   
                  There! I have got to the Professor at last-and he appears soon enough, too-for with what propriety can the principal character of the drama come on in the first scene? 
                  Is not Hamlet all the more interesting for the suspense in which he keeps the audience before he opens his lips; and do we not improve Richard by playing that everlasting scene about King Henry, while the tyrant lingers at the first entrance? 
                  "Insures partners to the most fastidious, and teaches the art of being irresistibly fascinating:-There, Major!" exclaimed a dark-eyed, roguish damsel, addressing my uncle, after the author before mentioned had finished reading the advertisement that stands at the head of this chapter-"what a capital chance for some people to be sure-just think what fun to have everybody falling in love with us." 
                  Of course my uncle had the gallantry to suggest that any new acquirement would be quite superfluous to a lady whose natural graces were fully able to insure such a result. 
                  At this Miss Kate Lawton (for by this name is the lady distinguished in the diary) thought it necessary to state that she didn't like flattery, and couldn't see why everybody so mistook her character as to be always saying such sort of things; adding much more to the same purport, after the manner in which people who are inordinately fond of hearing their own praises, really try to persuade themselves that they don't like it. 
                  "Well, well," observed Mr. Barnard, the reader of the advertisement, which he continued still to study, "I would give something to know what this fellow would say, if any one wrote to him." 
                  "If somebody will write the letter for me, I declare I'll try," rejoined Miss Kate. 
                  "No difficult matter that," said the author; "if the doctor hadn't forbid using my eyes in the evening, I'd do it myself; but here's the Major, who's just the man; the letter may be written to-night, sent off the first thing in the morning, and we shall have an answer by Wednesday." 
                  It was only much discussion and a considerable biological influence which streamed from the eyes of Miss Lawton, that reconciled my uncle to the plan; and his assent was given in the midst of serious doubts concerning the propriety of opening a correspondence with an individual who might make himself as troublesome as the German professor. The assent, however, being all that was wanted, the letter, by the joint inspirations of the trio, was composed upon the spot, and was quite a model of deceptive composition. 
                  It purported to be written by a certain Fanny Weston, who had been engaged to one Smitkinson, a clerk in a jeweller's shop. This young gentleman (so ran the tale) had basely broken his engagement, to contract another with Jane Gossifant, daughter of old Mr. Gossifant, who lived by the church at South Beckford, and had a comsumption and fifty thousand dollars. 
                  The requisite sum was inclosed, and advice requested in this delicate case. But an unexpected difficulty arose in determining the address to which the answer should be sent. There was a necessity of making use of some real name, for, the post-office being some miles off, the letters passed throguh the hands of an agent, who would obviously ly refuse any epistle bearing a name unknown in the establishment. The author, on account of his literary notoriety, declared he could not be thought of; but that my uncle, being nobody in particular, could not reasonably object to having the letter addressed to his care. 
                  The Major, although willing to assent to the first proposition relating to himself, could not easily be convinced of the second. The dispute waxed warm. Mr. Barnard could not see the force of my uncle's objections, and the dark-eyed young lady used those orbs to great effect, and only wished she could do anything to oblige anybody. The result might have been predicted. A postscript was added, directing the Professor to address Miss F. Weston, care of Major Wherrey, at the -- Water-Care. 
                  The letter was thoroughly sealed and deposited in a leathern bag which carried the mail of the establishment to the nearest post-office; and my uncle retired to bed with that dismal consciousness of having done something contrary to his best judgment, that always prevented the enjoyment of peaceful repose. 
                  During the three or four days that elapsed before the arrival of the letter containing so much valuable information, a stage-load of people was added to the guests. The slight scramble for seats at dinner, that usually succeeded such advents, generally resulted in everybody finding himself next to just the people whose society he would least have chosen. The exception, which is of such value in establishing the general rule, was, in this instance, in favor of my uncle. Happening to arrive rather late, he was driven in like a wedge between two very nice young ladies, who agreeably shortened the tedious entr'act between the meal and the dessert. 
                  
                     A nice young lady! What reasonable-sized folio could contain the different definitions of these simple words? 
                   
                  If some had their way, the candidates for this honorable degree would be examined in polking and small talk-some would select such text-books as Childe Harold and Corinne-while "Mrs. Farrar," and "Hints on Made Dishes," would be considered by others as necessary as the Faculty of Harvard College consider the grammars and readers of their own professors, to the proper preparation of a Freshman. 
                  As my uncle's opinion on this subject has the merit of being briefly expressed, it shall be set down for what it is worth. According to this authority, the title is deserved by any damsel who has learnt the great truth that perfect simplicity is perfect elegance.
                   
                  The two ladies near whom my kinsman was placed, and with whom he appears to have had considerable association, stood this test in a manner the most satisfactory. They were city-bred, and held what is called "a position in society"-advantages, by the way, that always make themselves evident in feminine deportment and finish. It is customary to compare (greatly to the advantage of the former) the good-tempered country girl with the indulged and affected creatures with whom sarcastic writers choose to people the drawing-rooms of the city. Now, there doubtless are many vulgar fellow-citizens of ours, who, having risen to sudden wealth, and not to the real position of dignity and intelligence, do conduct themselves quite unworthily; but that these gentry comprise, or in any legitimate way represent, the best society of our eastern cities, my uncle has never been willing to allow. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER V. 
                  THE remarks that concluded the last chapter, although having no connexion with the story, may serve to indicate the time supposed to elapse before the arrival of the Professor's answer; just as a drop-scene, representing a battle in Mexico, marks the interval between the acts of a Roman tragedy. 
                  The reader will now imagine the parlor of the establishment as it appeared on a particularly sultry summer's evening. The windows are all open-the company sufficiently mixed for everybody to serve as a restraint upon somebody else, and the Dorr-bugs (I have no idea how they spell their name) wrecking themselves against the ceiling, and thence tumbling upon the heads beneath, until you could not help sympathizing with the Reverend Homer Wilbur (in relation to a similar nuisance) in the doubt whether Noah could be justified in preserving this species of insect. 
                  A piano that was in the room, and a most obliging lady to officiate thereat, redeemed parts of the evening; but the event that waked up everybody was the entrance of Kate Lawton with a letter from Professor Phantillo. 
                  It was read aloud at the request of many voices; but the contents were vague and unsatisfactory. There was something concerning the position and influence of the planets (which it seems were averse to any interposition just then, though holding out good hopes for the future), a little concerning the mysteries of love and courtship in general, and a great deal about a future remittance of money. The interest of the communication, however, was reserved for the postscript, which ran as follows: 
                  "I desire some information concerning this Major Wherrey, to whose care this letter is to be addressed. I discern that your fate is strangely connected with his. I shall be glad to learn the amount of his property; also, whether he is disposed to believe in the science which I profess. Not a word to him of these inquiries; but answer me discreetly and secretly and I will help you, to a fortune beyond your proudest hopes." 
                  "Ha, ha, ha," laughed Mr. Barnard; "the Professor is completely taken in; he evidently thinks that he has fallen upon a vein of metal that will pay the working. Don't you see, Major, he means to inform himself about your property, habits, etc., and then come down on you in some dexterous manner for a remittance. Well, this is good! I'd no idea we should have such success!" 
                  "Success!" exclaimed my uncle, starting from his seat; "yes! it's fine fun for you-but consider the fellow knows my real name-he will be angry enough when he discovers the hoax, and in some way or other will make me pay for it." And a dismal diorama, representing respectable elderly gentlemen who had unwittingly fallen into the power of some character whom they were obliged to furnish with pocket-money forever after, unrolled itself before the mental vision of my relative. 
                  To be sure, Major Wherrey was unable to recollect that he had embezzled at the bank, or ever entertained a passion for his cook; but his faith was strong in the ability of his scientific friend to discover some point upon which to rest the lever of persecution, should he be so disposed. Such dismal forebodings were not shared by Miss Kate Lawton, who declared the letter quite worth the two dollars it had cost, and was particularly diverted with the connexion discovered between her destiny and anybody then at the water-cure. 
                  Much more was said or sung (the latter by the lady at the piano) during the evening; all which I would set down, if I "naturally ran to conversation." But, not having the talent of Miss Burney for this, as well as one or two other things, I think it best to keep up the sober jog of narration. And here let me avow, what I have no doubt the reader has suspected all along, that the title of this paper, "a romance," is altogether a misnomer. Yet, when I inscribed that taking substantive at the head of my first chapter, I had no idea of asking a hearing under false pretences. The note-books, which were mentioned as being in my possession, and the singular sequel to the adventures they contain, seemed to me materials from which an elegant structure of fiction might be reared, and I had actually the temerity to draw a sketch for the ground-floor. But the strong solution of fact with which my mind was filled, would precipitate itself upon the paper, till at last the proposed embellishments of fancy were thrown aside, and I became a chronicler of real experience, almost against my will. 
                  Well! my uncle passed a hot, uncomfortable night. Hot!-yes; it was hot indeed. You could almost cut the caloric with a knife. Everybody pretended to go to bed, but speedily rose, and stumbled about the entries all night Muttered execrations, combined with the notes of a distant musical box, streamed through the ventilator, and pervaded my uncle's apartment, while "friends in boots," stalked up and down the piazza before the window, with the same interminable tramp. 
                  Sleep was impossible for the most innocent or thoughtless during that long night. Every half hour, or so, my uncle would go down cellar, and paddle about the tank; which performance served to impart a more fiery sultriness to his chamber, when he came out. 
                  But the extreme discomfiture of his bodily state, was exceeded by the turbulent nature of his mental speculations. One may dismiss a troublesome thought, or suspicion, by day; but during a sleepless night, the unwelcome visitor returns, and leers upon him horribly, and will not be exorcised. This waking nightmare is far more terrible than anything dreams can furnish, and leaves us as weak and miserable as was Sancho Panza, after the visit of the Enchanted Moors, at the village inn. 
                  In short, Major Wherrey, naturally nervous and timid, was goaded almost to frenzy at the remembrance of his own indiscretion. At Bearbrook, too! that this Professor Phantillo should live at Bearbrook, where my uncle's famous cranberry plantation was situated, and where he himself resided several months in the year! "Good heavens!" thought the poor gentleman, "what an opportunity it gives him for raking together all sorts of scandal, for setting my neighbors against me, and perhaps getting up some curious chemical blight for the cranberries!" 
                  Two letters, that were brought to my uncle's roqm the next morning, served to plunge him into still deeper perplexity. The first was written on odd-looking paper, was post-marked from Bearbrook, bore a strictly non-committal seal, and turned out to be from Professor Phantillo himself. It was filled with dark hints about secret information the Professor had received, which obliged him to suppose that Major Wherrey had tampered with the affections of a certain Miss Fanny Weston, and stated that unless the sum of twenty dollars was received by the next post, he should feel it his duty to publish his suspicions in the Bearbrook Gazette.
                   
                  The other epistle was from a nameless gentleman, connected with the New York press, who politely forwarded a copy of an article that was to appear in the Criminal Investigator of the next week. 
                  Poor Major Wherrey was nearly beside himself at this palpable conspiracy. He drove to the next town to consult a lawyer; and came back again to advise with the doctor. He bewailed his fate with no gentle expletives touching himself, the Professor, Miss Lawton, Mr. Barnard, and the New York reporter. Finally, his trunks were ordered, and he determined to fly from his tormentors. 
                  There was no stage, however, before afternoon, and six or eight hours must be endured before any one could leave the place. The obliging young lady played the Wedding March upon the piano; but music had no charm to soothe the troubles of my uncle. In a fit of impatient desperation, Major Wherrey seized a book from the centre-table of the "boarders' parlor"-where the usual number were collected to stare at each other, and wish away the morning-and hastily turned over its leaves. It had the popular alliterative title, and, of course, had sold to an almost mythical number of copies-at least, so said the publishers. 
                  "Harpoons and Hautboys, from Hatty's Haversack," repeated my uncle, as he glanced over the title-page, and then with a start of recognition-'Miss Kate Lawton, from her friend, T. Barnard." The start was occasioned by a remarkable resemblance that Major Wherrey detected between the chirography of these latter words and that of Professor Phantillo; nor was his astonishment lessened when he observed, in the handwriting of the New York reporter, near the bottom of the page, this expressive criticism-"A book just such as I like.-K. L." 
                  Of course, my uncle's understanding received a sudden illumination from this accidental discovery. Relieved from his apprehensions so unexpectedly, his first impulse was to embrace his persecutors, as if they had done him some distinguished favor; then came the revulsion of feeling, and the mortification of having been successfully hoaxed-than which there are few things harder to bear with equanimity. 
                  He was, nevertheless, reminded by the lady and gentleman who had amused themselves at his expense, of an opinion he had himself expressed upon the allowability of a practical joke, when there was positively no other way of getting rid of time-and the contempt with which he had dared anybody to take him in-if they could. 
                  As this reminiscence served to check the bitter complaints of which the Major was about to deliver himself, he summoned sufficient discretion "to smooth his cheek to smiles," and pretended to laugh at his own misfortune. 
                  At any rate, his equanimity was completely restored when some whiskey, lemons, and sugar, smuggled from the neighboring village, were mingled with the water supplied so lavishly by the institution, and the door being locked, he sat with Mr. Barnard enjoying the same after dinner. 
                  "Well, sir," said my uncle, after the Professor's epistles had been duly discussed, "so you sent the letters to Bear-brook to be post-marked; and all that stuff about my fate being united with that of Miss Kate Lawton, and the havoc I had made with her affections, was written by you!" 
                  "Written by me-yes"-replied Mr. Barnard, "but dictated by herself." 
                
                
                  CHAPTER VI. 
                  AND now we have come to the last chapter, which, according to all rules and precedents, should contain a wedding, or, at the very least, an engagement. I have something of the kind to put into it, you may be sure, though it may not prove of the most legitimate description. 
                  In fact, had I persevered in my first idea, and made a romance out of this matter, I should have bestowed the hand of Miss Kate Lawton upon Signor Kwinsidi, the gentleman from Norway, or Sir Harold Skiff, the English Baronet; both of whom, as I learn from my uncle's diary, were sojourners at the establishment during his visit, and appear to have been of person and years suitable for the manufacture of a hero. 
                  But, as I have determined to adhere to the real facts in the case, and tell, not what Miss Kate could, would, or should have done, but what she actually did do-I am compelled to declare that she is at present my aunt. 
                  To make a lively young creature of three-and-twenty marry a somewhat infirm gentleman of forty-two, even if he did have a fine house in the country, and could keep his carriage in town, would, I admit, in any work of fiction be utterly unnatural and preposterous. I can only urge, in palliation of so original a finale, the excuse Ben Jonson once advanced for dispensing with the graces of rhyme-that the fact stated happens to be true.
                   
                  Of course I was astonished at the engagement, and suspected the parties immediately concerned must have been still more so. Yet, it is not difficult to see how it happened. My uncle had never seen so much of any lady before, and no lady had ever seemed so disposed to see a great deal of him. But, after all, it is likely enough that the whole affair was determined upon and arranged soon after Major Wherrey's arrival. "Here is a good-tempered gentleman, of handsome fortune, who only wants a little encouragement, to take a wife to assist him in spending it-and if so, why should not I, as well as any one else, profit by the circumstance?" Mind,-I don't say that Miss Kate said or thought anything of the kind; I only decline to peril the perfect authenticity of this history by declaring that she did not.
                   
                   
                  But however it came about, I am heartily glad that it did come about, somehow-for a happier match was never lighted amid such watery surroundings. Happy! yes, you would have thought so, had you been at Bearbrook last winter during the session of the Court. Why, that great house was full of company, and Major Wherrey, all smiles, was going about from one guest to another, expatiating upon the excellence of his wife and his cranberries, and entreating us all to make ourselves perfectly at home-for which every one thanked him sincerely, and declared he would. 
                  And, what is more, I believe we did it, too-only that nobody's real home could have been half so amusing. You should have seen our Bearbrook theatricals-not the performance of Love's Sacrifice: that, to be sure, was a failure-but those two farces in which Aunt Catherine played the chambermaid, and had fifteen bouquets thrown upon her by the delighted audience. And then that good romping country ball, when the young lady who "never meant to marry" found herself engaged to Sir Harold Skiff; and Mr. Barnard sung that capital song after supper, and even Kwinsidi, the imperturbable Norwegian, was stimulated into something like life. But, as the reader did not see all this (that is, supposing he was not of the party), I can only wish him better luck another time, and not try to anticipate his pleasure by imperfect reminiscences. 
                  In conclusion, then-but, stop:-before concluding, I wish to say a word to Mr. Frank Osborne, whose history of "Wensley" I have just read with almost unmingled satisfaction. 
                  There exists in that work a passage highly commendatory of the "institution of cousins," and, by implication, rather severe upon those who are slow to appreciate the advantages of this blessed relationship; but, Mr. Osborne, had you had a young and pretty kinswoman, to whose luxurious mansion you were always welcomed, whom you could drive, and read to, and take to the theatre, without the confounded report of an engagement, and the shrugs and frowns of fathers and brothers-had you found such a treasure at Wensley, should we not have read:- 
                  "Cousins may be very well for those who can get nothing better; but,-there is virtue in an Aunt.
                   
                
             
             
                
               VII. THE MORMON'S WIFE. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "'Woe to that man,' his warning voice replied 
                           To all who questioned, or in silence sighed- 
                           'Woe to that man who ventures truth to win, 
                           And seeks his object by the path of sin!'" 
                        
                      
                     -SCHILLER. 
                   
                
               "I DON'T think much, my young friend, of those Mormons! I have had some reasons of my own for disliking them!" said Parson Field to me, as we sat together, one August noon, in the porch of his red house at Plainfield. 
               "Do tell me, sir," said I, setting myself in an easy attitude to hear his story-for a story from Parson Field was not to be despised-his quaint simplicity bringing out, in old-time and expressive phrases, whatever he describes with the clear fidelity of an interior by Mieris. "Do tell me," said I again, with a deeper emphasis; whereat the old gentleman looked at me over his spectacles, and, smiling benignantly into my eager face, began: 
               "When I first came to Plainfield," said he, "more than thirty years ago, I had been a minister of the Lord only ten years, and I had been settled for that period of time in a large city, where I served acceptably to a worthy congregation; but certain reasons of my own induced me to leave that situation, and come here to live, where also I found acceptance, and not many months after I came there was a considerable reviving of the work in this place, and many believed. Of these was a certain Joseph Frazer, a young Scotchman, concerning whom I felt much misgiving, lest he should take the wrong path; but he, in due season, joined himself to the Church, and edified the brethren in walk and conversation; so that, when he left Plainfield and settled in the West Indies, we were loath to have him go. 
               "Some years afterwards we heard he was married there to a lady of Spanish extraction, and a Catholic; and, after ten years elapsed, she died, leaving him one child, a daughter, eight years of age, and with her he came to Plainfield, desiring that the child, whom he had named Adeline, after his own mother, should have a New England training. 
               "But, wonderful are the ways of Providence! On his return to Cuba, he perished in the vessel, which went down in a heavy gale off Cape Hatteras; and when the news came to his mother, old Mrs. Frazer, she sent for me that I should tell the child Adeline, for she had given proofs of a singular nature, ardent and self-confident in the extreme. I took my hat, and went over to Mrs. Frazer's with a very heavy heart, for the grief of a child is a fearful thing to me, and to be the bringer of evil tidings, that shall stain the pureness and calm of a child's thoughts with the irreparable shadow of death, is no light thing, nor easily to be done. I entered into the house one day in June; it was a very sweet day, and, as I walked quietly into the low kitchen, I saw Adeline, with her head resting on her hands, and her large eyes eagerly gazing out of the window at the gambols of a scarlet-throated humming-bird. I went close to her, and thought to myself that I would speak, but I did not, for I saw that in her little pale face which made me more sad than before; and I had it on my lips to say, 'Adeline, are you homesick?' (which was the thing of all others I should not say) when suddenly she turned about, and answered the question before I spoke it. 
               "'Sir,' said she, 'I wish I was in Cuba. I had just such a humming-bird at home; and I fed it with orange boughs full of white flowers, every day; but you have no orange trees here, and I have no papa!' 
               "It seemed to me that the child's angel had thus opened the way for me to speak, and I began to say some things about the love of our universal Father, when she laid her little hand on my arm with a fearfully strong pressure. 'Mr. Field,' said she, 'is my papa dead?' I never shall forget the eyes that looked that question into mine. I felt like an unveiled spirit before their eager, piercing stare. I did not answer except by a strong quiver of feeling that would run over my features, for I loved her father even as a kinsman, and I needed to say nothing more, for the child fell at my feet quite rigid, and I called Mrs. Frazer, who tried all her nurse-arts to restore little Adeline; but was forced, at last, to send for a physician, who bled the child, and brought her round. 
               "In the meantime I had gone home to prepare my sermon, for it was not yet finished, and the day was Friday; but I kept seeing that little lifeless face, all orphaned as it was, and the Scripture, 'As one whom his mother comforteth,' was so borne in upon my mind, that, although I had previously fixed upon one adapted to a setting forth of the doctrine of election, I was wrought upon to make the other the subject of my discourse: and truly, the people wept; almost all but Adeline, who sat in the square pew with her great eyes fixed upon me, and her small lips apart, like one who drinks from the stream of a rock. 
               "The next day I was resting, as my custom is, after the Sabbath; and in a warm, fair day, I find no better rest than to sit by the open window, and breathe the summer air, and fill my eyes and heart with the innumerable love-tokens that God hath set thickly in Nature. I was, therefore, at my usual place, rapt in thought, and beholding the labors of a small bird which taught her young to fly, when I felt a light, cold touch, and, turning, saw little Adeline beside me. 'Sir,' said she, without any preface, 'when my papa went away he left with me a letter, which he said I was to give you if he died.' So far she spoke steadily, but there the small voice quivered and broke down. I took the letter she proffered me, and, breaking the seal, found it a short but touching appeal to me, as the spiritual father of Joseph Frazer, to take his own child under my care, and be as a father to her, inasmuch as his mother was old and feeble, and also to be executor of his will, of which a copy was inclosed. I said this much to the child as shortly as I could, and with her grave voice she replied, 'Sir, I should like to be your little girl, if you will preach me some more sermons.' Now I was affected at this answer; not the less that the leaven of pride, which worketh in every man, was fed by even a baby's praise; and, putting on my hat, I walked over to Mrs. Frazer's house and laid the matter before her. She was not, at first, willing to give up Adeline; but at length, after much converse to and fro, she came to my conclusion, that the child would be better in my hands, inasmuch as she herself could not hope for a long continuance: and, as it was ordered, she died the next summer. I sent for my sister Martha, who was somewhat past marriageable years, but kind and good, to come and keep house for me, and from that time Adeline was as my own child. But I must hasten over a time, for I am too long in telling this. 
               "In course of years the child grew up, tall and slender, of a very stately carriage, and having that scriptural glory of a woman, long and abundant hair. 
                
               "She was still very fervid in her feelings, but reserved and proud; and I fear I had been too tender with her for her good, inasmuch as she thought her own will and pleasure must always be fulfilled, and we all know that is not one of the ordinations of Providence. 
               "As Adeline came to be a woman, divers youths of my congregation were given to call of a Sabbath night, with red apples for me, and redder cheeks for Adeline, who was scarcely civil to them, and often left them to my conversation, which they seemed not to relish so much as would have been pleasing to human nature. 
               "But my sainted mother, who was not wanting in the wisdom of this world, was used to say that every man and woman had their time of crying for the moon; and while some knew it to be a burning fire, and others scornfully called it cheese, and if they got it, either burned their fingers, or despised their desire, still all generations must have their turn; and truly, I believed it, when I found that Adeline herself began to have a pining for something which I could not persuade her to specify. The child grew thin and pale, and ceased the singing of psalms at her daily task, and I could not devise what should be done for her; though Martha strongly recommended certain herb teas, which Adeline somewhat unreasonably rebelled against. However, about this time, my attention was a little turned from her, as there was much religious awakening in the place, and among others, whom the deacons singled out as special objects of attention, was one John Henderson, a frequent visitor at our house, and a young man of good parts and kindly feeling, as it seemed, but of a peculiar nature, being easily led into either right or wrong, yet still given to fits of stubbornness, when he could not be drawn, so to speak, with a cart-rope. 
               "Now Adeline had been a professor of religion for some years, but it did not seem to me that she took a right view of this particular season, for many times she refused to go to the prayer-meetings, even to those which were held with special intentions towards the unconverted; and many times, on my return, I found her with pale cheeks and red eyes, evidently from tears. About this time, also, she began to take long, solitary walks, from which she returned with her hands full of wild flowers, for it was now early spring; but she cared nothing for the flowers, and would scatter them about the house to fade, without a thought. In the meantime, the revival progressed, but, I lament to say, with no visible change in John Henderson. He had gotten into one of his stubborn moods of mind, and neither heaven nor, hell seemed to affect him. The only softening I could perceive in the young man was during the singing of hymns, which was well done In our meeting-house, for Adeline led the choir, and I noticed that, whenever that part of the exercises began, John Henderson would lift up his head, and a strange color and tender expression seemed to melt the hard lines of his face. 
               "Somewhere about the latter end of April, as I was returning from a visit to a sick man, I met John coming from a piece of woods, that lay behind my house about a mile, with his hands full of liverwort blossoms. I do not know why this little circumstance gave me comfort, yet, I have ever observed, that a man who loves the manifestations of God in His works is more likely to be led into religion than a brutal or mere business man; so I was desirous of speaking to the youth, but when he saw me he turned from the straight path, and, like an evil-doer, fled across the fields another way. I did not call after him, for some experience has constrained me to think that there is no little wisdom in sometimes letting people alone; but I took my own way home, and, having put on my cloth shoes to ease my feet, and being in somewhat of a maze of thought, I went up to my study, as it seemed, very quietly, for I entered at the open door and found Adeline sitting in my arm-chair by the window, quite unaware of my nearness. I well remember how like a spirit she looked that day, with her great eyes raised to a cloud that rested in the bright sky, her soft black hair twisted into a crown about her head, and her light dress falling all over the chair, while in her hands, lying between the slight fingers, and by the bluer veins, was clasped a bunch of liverwort blossoms. Then I perceived, for the first time, why my child was crying for the moon, and that John Henderson cared for the singing and not for the hymns, at which I sorrowed. But I sat down by Ada, and taking the flowers out of her cold hands, began to say that I had met John Henderson on the road with some such blossoms, at which she looked at me even as she did when I told her about her father, and, seeing that I smiled, and yet was not dry-eyed, nor quite at rest, the tears began slowly to run over her eyelashes, and in a few very resolute words she told me that Mr. Henderson had asked her that morning to marry him. 
               "Now I knew not well what to say, but I set myself aside, as far as I could, and tried not to remember how sore a trial it would be to part with Ada, and I reasoned with her calmly about the youth, setting forth, first, that he was not a professing Christian, and that the Scripture seemed plain to me on that matter, though I would not constrain her conscience if she found it clear in this thing; and, second, that he was a man who held fast to this world's goods, and was like to be a follower of Mammon if he learned not love better things in his youth; and, third, that he was a man who had, as one might say, a streak of granite in his nature, against which a feeling person would continually fall and be hurt, and which no person could work upon, if once it came in the way even of right action. To all this Adeline answered with more reason than I supposed a woman could, only that I noticed, at the end of each answer, she said in a low voice, as if it were the end of all contention,-'and I love him.' Whereby, seeing that the thing was well past my interference, I gave my consent with many doubts and fears in my heart, and having blessed the child, I sent her away that I might meditate over this matter. 
               "When John came in the evening for his answer, I was enabled to exhort him faithfully, and, in his softened state of feeling, he chose to tell me that he had been seeking religion because he feared I would not give him Adeline unless he would join the Church, and he could not make a hypocrite of himself, even for that, but he had hoped that in the use of means he might be awakened and converted. At this I was pleased, inasmuch as it showed a spirit of truth in the young man, but I could not avoid setting before him that self-seeking had never led any soul to God, and how cogent a reason he had himself given for his want of success in things pertaining to his salvation; but as I spoke Ada came in by the other door, and John's eyes began to wander so visibly, that I thought it best to conclude, and I must say he appeared grateful. So I went out of the door, leaving Ada stately and blushing as a fair rose-tree, notwithstanding that John Henderson seemed to fancy she needed his support. 
               "As the year went on, and I could not in conscience let Adeline leave me until her lover had some fixed maintenance, I had many conversations with him (for he also was an orphan), and it was at length decided that he should buy, with Ada's portion, a goodly farm in Western New York; and in the ensuing summer, after a year's engagement ment, they were to marry. So the summer came; I know not exactly what month was fixed for their marriage, though I have the date somewhere, but one thing I recollect, that the hop-vine over this porch was in full bloom, and after I had joined my child and the youth in the bands of wedlock, I went out into the porch to see them safe into the carriage that was to take them to the boat, and there Ada put her arms about my neck, and kissed me for good-by, leaving a hot tear upon my cheek; and a south wind at that moment smote the hop-vine so that its odor of honey and bitterness mingled swept across my face, and always afterwards this scent made me think of Adeline. After two years had passed away, during which we heard from her often, we heard that she had a little daughter born, and her letters were full of joy and pride, so that I trembled for the child's spiritual state; but after some three years the little girl, with her mother, came to Plainfield, and I did not know but Adeline was excusable in her joy, for such a fair and bright child was scarcely ever seen; but the next summer came sad news: little Nelly was dead, and Ada's grief seemed inexhaustible, while her husband fell into one of his sullen states of mind, and the affliction passed over them to no good end, as it seemed. 
               "Soon after this the Mormon delusion began to spread rapidly about John Henderson's dwelling-place, and in less than a year after Nelly's death I had a letter from Ada, dated at St. Louis, which I will read to you, for I have it in my pocket-book, having retained it there since yesterday, when I took it out from the desk to consult a date. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "It begins:-'Dear Uncle' (I had always instructed the child so to call me, rather than father, seeing we can have but one father, while we may be blessed with numerous uncles), 'I suppose you will wonder how I came to be at St. Louis, and it is just my being here that I write to explain. You know how my husband felt about Nelly's death, but you cannot know how I felt; for, even in my very great sorrow, I hoped all the time, that by her death, John might be led to a love of religion. He was very unhappy, but he would not show it, only that he took even more tender care of me than before. I have always been his darling and pride; he never let me work, because he said it spoiled my hands; but after Nelly died, he was hardly willing I should breathe; and though he never spoke of her, or seemed to feel her loss, yet I have heard him whisper her name in his sleep, and every morning his hair and pillow were damp with crying; but he never knew I saw it. After a few months, there came a Mormon preacher into our neighborhood, a man of a great deal of talent and earnestness, and a firm believer in the revelation to Joseph Smith. At first my husband did not take any notice of him, and then he laughed at him for being a believer in what seemed like nonsense; but one night he was persuaded to go and hear Brother Marvin preach in the school-house, and he came home with a very sober face. I said nothing, but when I found there was to be a meeting the next night, I asked to go with him, and, to my surprise, I heard a most powerful and exciting discourse, not wanting in either sense or feeling, though rather poor as to argument; but I was not surprised that John wanted to hear more, nor that, in the course of a few weeks, he avowed himself a Mormon, and was received publicly into the sect Dear Uncle, you will be shocked, I know, and you will wonder why I did not use my influence over my husband, to keep him from this delusion; but you do not know how much I have longed and prayed for his conversion to a religious life; until any religion, even one full of errors, seemed to me better than the hardened and listless state of his mind. 
                            
                           "'I could not but feel, that if he were awakened to a sense of the life to come, in any way, his own good sense would lead him right in the end: and there is so much ardor and faith about this strange belief, that I do not regret his having fallen in with it, for I think the true burning of Gospel faith will yet be kindled by means of this strange fire. In the meantime he is very eager and full of zeal for the cause, so much so, that thinking it to be his duty, he resolved to sell our farm at Oakwood, and remove to Utah. If anything could make me grieve over a change I believe to be for John's spiritual good, it would be this idea; but no regret or sorrow of mine shall ever stand in the way of his soul; so I gave as cheerful a consent as I could to the sale, and I only cried a few tears over little Nelly's bed, under the great tulip-tree. There my husband has put an iron railing, and I have planted a great many sweetbrier vines over the rock; and Mr. Keeney, who bought the farm, has promised that the spot shall be kept free from weeds, so I leave her in peace. Do write to me, Uncle Field. I feel sure I have done right, because it has not been in my own way, yet sometimes I am almost afraid. I shall be very far away from you, and from home, and my child; but I am so glad now she is in heaven, nothing can trouble her, and I shall not care much about myself, if John goes right. 
                           "'Give my love to Aunt Martha, and please write to your dear child. 
                           
                              "'ADA HENDERSON.'
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               "I need not say, my young friend," resumed Parson Field, wiping his. spectacles, and clearing his voice with a vigorous ahem!! "that I could not, in conscience, approve of Adeline's course. 'Thou shalt not do evil that good may come,' is a Gospel truth, and cannot be transgressed with good consequences. I did write to Ada; but, inasmuch as the act was done, I said not much concerning it, but bade her take courage, seeing that she had meant to do right, although in the deed she had considered John Henderson before anything else, which was, as you may perceive, her besetting sin, and therefore it seemed good to me to put at the end of my epistle (as I was wont always to offer a suitable text of Scripture for her meditation) these words, 'Little children, keep yourselves from idols!' I did not hear again from Adeline, till she had been two months in the Mormon city, and though she tried her best to seem contented and peaceful, in view of John's new zeal, and his tender care of her, still I could not but think of the hop-blossoms, for I perceived underneath this pleasant sweetness, a little drop of life and pain working to some unseen end. That year passed away and we heard no more, and the next also, at which I wondered much; but, reflecting on the chances of travel across those deserts, and having a surety of Ada's affection for me, I did not repine, though I felt some regret that there was such uncertainty of carriage; nevertheless, I wrote as usual that no chance might be lost. 
               "The third summer was unusually warm in our parts, and its heats following upon a long, wet spring, caused much and grievous sickness, and I was obliged to be out at all hours with the dying, and at funerals, so that my bodily strength was well-nigh exhausted, and at haying-time, just as I was cutting the last swath on my river meadow, which is low-lying land, and steamed with hot vapor as I laid it bare to the sun, I fell forward across my scythe-snath and fainted. This was the beginning of a long course of fever, of a typhoid character, during which I was either stupid or delirious most of the time; and, while I lay sick, there came a letter to me from Salt Lake City, written chiefly by John Henderson, who begged me to come on, if it was a possible thing and see his wife, who was wasting with a slow consumption, and much bent upon seeing me. I could discern that the letter was not willingly written; it was stiff in speech, though writ with a trembling hand. At the end of it were a few lines from Ada herself; a very impatient and absolute cry for me, as if she could not die till I came. Now Martha had opened this letter, as she was forced to by my great illness, and, having read it, asked the doctor if it was well to propound the contents to me, and he said decidedly that he could not answer for my life if she did: so Martha, like a considerate woman, wrote an answer herself to John Henderson (of which she kept a copy for me to see), setting forth that I was in no state to be moved with such tidings; that, however, I should have the letter as soon as the doctor saw fit, and sending her love and sympathy to Ada, and a recommend that she should try balm tea. 
               "After a long season of suspense, I was graciously uplifted from fever, and enabled to leave my bed for a few hours daily; and when I could ride out, which was only by the latter end of October, I was given the child's letter, and my heart sunk within me, for I knew how bitterly she had needed my strength to help her. It was a warm autumn day, near to noon, when I read that letter, and, as I leaned back in my chair, the red sunshine came in upon me, and the smell of dead leaves; while upon the hop-vine one late blossom, spared by the white frosts, and dropping across the window, also put forth its scent, bringing Adeline, as it were, right back into my arms, and the faintness passed away from me with some tears, for I was weak, and a man may not always be stronger than his nature. Now, when Martha sounded the horn for dinner, and our hired man came in from the hill lot, where he was sowing wheat, I saw that he had a letter in his hand of great size and thickness; and, coming into the keeping-room where I sat, he said that Squire White had brought it over from the post-office as he came along, thinking I would like to have it directly. I was rather loath to open the great packet at first, for I bethought myself it was likely to be some Consociation proceedings, which were never otherwise than irksome to me, and were now weary to think of, seeing the grasshopper had become a burden. I reached my spectacles down from the nail, and found the post-mark to be that of the Mormon city; and with unsteady hand I opened the seal, and found within several sheets of written letter-paper, directed to me in Ada's writing, and a short letter from John Henderson, which ran thus: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "'DEAR SIR,
                            
                           "'My first wife, Adeline Frazer Henderson, departed this life on the sixth of July, at my house, in the city of Great Salt Lake. Shortly before dying she called upon me, in the presence of two sisters, and one of the saints, to deliver into your hands the inclosed packet, and tell you of her death. According to her wish I send the papers by mail; and, hoping you may yet be called to be a partaker in the faith of the saints below, I remain your afflicted, yet rejoicing friend, 
                           
                              "'JOHN HENDERSON.'
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               "I was really stunned for a moment, my young friend, not only with grief at my own loss, but with pity and surprise at the entire deadening, as it appeared, of natural affection in the man to whom I had given my daughter; and also my conscience was not free from offence, for I could not but think that a more fervent and wrestling expostulation, on the sin of marrying an unbeliever, might have saved Adeline from sorrow in the flesh. However, I said as much as seemed best at the time, and upon that reflection I rested myself; for he who adheres to a pure intention, need not repent of his deeds afterwards; and the next day, when my present anguish and weakness had somewhat abated, I read the manuscript Ada had sent me. 
               "It was, doubtless, penned with much reluctance, for the child's natural pride was great, and no less weighty subject than her husband's salvation could have forced her to speak of what she wrote to me; and, indeed, I should feel no right to put the confidence into your hands, were not my child beyond the reach of man's judgment, and did I not feel it a sacred duty to protest, so long as life lasts, against this abominable Mormon delusion, and the no less delusive pretext of doing evil that good may come. I cannot read Ada's letter aloud to you, for there is to be a funeral at two o'clock, which I must attend; but I will give you the papers, and you may sit in my chair and read; only be patient with my bees, if they come too near you, for they like the hop-blossoms, and never sting unless you strike." 
               So saying, Parson Field gave me his leathern chair and the papers, and I sat down in the hop-crowned porch, to read Adeline Henderson's story, with a sort of reverence for her that prompted me to turn the rustling pages carefully, and feel startled if a door swung to in the quiet house, as if I were eaves-dropping; but soon I ceased to hear, absorbed in her letter, which began as the first did. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "DEAR UNCLE,
                            
                           "To-day I begged John to write, and ask you to come here. I could not write you since I came here but that once, though your letters have been my great comfort, and I added a few words of entreaty to his, because I am dying, and it seems as if I must see you before I die; yet I fear the letter may not reach you, or you maybe sick; and for that reason I write now, to tell you how terrible a necessity urged me to persuade you to such a journey. I can write but little at a time, my side is so painful; they call it slow-consumption here, but I know better; the heart within me is turned to stone. I felt it then-. Ah! you see my mind wandered in that last line; it still will return to the old theme, like a fugue tune, such as we had in the Plainfield singing-school. I remember one that went, 'The Lord is just, is just, is just'-Is He? Dear Uncle, I must begin at the beginning, or you never will know. I wrote you from St. Louis, did I not? I meant to. From there, we had a dreary journey, not so bad to Fort Leaven-worth, but after that inexpressibly dreary, and set with tokens of the dead, who perished before us. A long reach of prairie, day after day, and night after night; grass, and sky, and graves; grass, and sky, and graves; till I hardly knew whether the life I dragged along was life or death, as the thirsty, feverish days wore on into the awful and breathless nights, when every creature was dead asleep, and the very stars in heaven grew dim in the hot, sleepy air-dreadful days! I was too glad to see that bitter in land sea, blue as the fresh lakes, with its gray islands of bare rock, and sparkling sand shores; still more rejoiced to come upon the city itself, the rows of quaint, bare houses, and such cool water-sources, and, over all, near enough to rest both eyes and heart, the sun-lit mountains, 'the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.' 
                           "I liked my new house well. It was too large for our need, but pleasanter for its airiness, and the first thing I did, was to plant a little hop-vine, that I had brought all the way with such great care by the east porch. I wanted something like Plainfield in my home. I don't know why I linger so. I must write faster, for I grow weak all the time. 
                           "I liked the city very well for awhile; the neighbors were kind, and John more than that. I could not be unhappy with him-I thought. We had a pretty garden, for another man had owned the house before us, and we had not to begin everything. Our next-door neighbor, Mrs. Colton, was good and kind to me; so was her daughter Lizzy, a pretty girl, with fair hair, very fair. I wonder John liked it after mine. The first great shock I had was at a Mormon meeting. I cannot very well remember the ceremony, because I grew so faint; but I would not faint away lest some one should see me. I only remember that it was Mrs. Colton's husband with another wife being "sealed" to him, as they say here. You don't know what that means, Uncle Field; it is one part of this religion of Satan, that any man may have, if he will, three or four wives, perhaps more. I only know that shameless man, with grown daughters, and the hair on his head snow-white, has taken two, and his own wife, a firm believer in this-faith! looks on calmly, and lives with them in peace. I know that, and my soul sickened with disgust, but I did not fear; not a thought, not a dream, not a shadow of fear crossed me. I should have despised myself for ever if the idea had stained my soul; my husband was my husband,-mine-before God and man! and our child was in heaven; how glad I was she could never be a Mormon.! 
                           "I was sorry for Mrs. Colton, though she did not need it, and when I saw John leaning over their gate, or smoking in the porch with the old man, I thought he felt so, too, and I was glad to see him more sociable than ever he was in the States. After awhile he did not smoke, but talked with Elder Colton, and then would come home and expound out of the book of Mormon to me. I was very glad to have him earnest in his religion, but I could not be. Then be grew very thoughtful, and had a silent fit, but I took no notice of it, though I think now he meant to leave me, but I began to pine a little for home, and when I worked in the garden, and trained the vines about our veranda, I used to wish he would help me as he did Lizzy Colton, but I still remembered how good he was to pity and help them. 
                           "Oh, fool! yet, I had rather be a fool over again, than have imagined-that I am glad of, even now-I did not once suspect. 
                           "But one day-I remember every little thing in that day-even the slow ticking of the clock, as I tied up my hop-vine; and after that I went into the garden, and sat down on a little bench under the grape-trellis, and looked at the mountains. How beautiful they were! all purple in the shadow of sunset, and the sky golden green above them, with one scarlet cloud floating slowly upwards: I hope I shall never see a red cloud again. Presently, John came and sat by me, and I laid my head on his shoulder; I was so glad to have him there-it cured my homesickness; once or twice he began to say something, and stopped, but I did not mind it. I wanted him to see a low line of mist creeping down a canon in the mountains, and I stood up to point it out; so he rose, too, and in a strange, hurried way, began to say something about the Mormon faith, and the duties of a believer, which I did not notice either very much-I was so full of admiring the scarlet cloud-when, like a sudden thunder-clap to my ear, I heard this quick, resolute sentence: 'And so, according to the advice and best judgment of the Saints, Elizabeth Colton will be sealed to me, after two days, as my spiritual wife.' 
                            
                           "Then my soul fled out of my lips, in one try-I was dead-my heart turned to a stone, and nothing can melt it. I did not speak, or sigh, but sat down on the bench, and John talked a great deal; I think he rubbed my hands, and kissed me, but I did not feel it. I went away, by-and-by, when it was dark, into the house and into my room. I locked the door and looked at the wall till morning, then I went down and sat in a chair till night; and I drank, drank, drank, like a fever. All the time cold water, but it never reached my thirst. John came home, but he did not dare touch me; I was a dead corpse, with another spirit in it-not his wife-she was dead, and gone to heaven on a bright cloud. I remember being glad of that. 
                           "In two days more he had a wife, and I was not his any longer. I stayed upstairs when he was in the house, and locked my door, till, after a great many days, I began to feel sorry for him. Oh! how sorry! for I knew-I know-he will see himself some day with my eyes, but not till I die. Then I found my lips full of blood one morning, and that pleased me, for I knew it was a promise of the life to come; now I shall go to heaven where there aren't any Mormons. 
                           "I believe, though, people were kind to me all the time; for I remember they came and said things to me, and one shook me a little to see if I felt; and one woman cried. I was glad of that, for I couldn't cry. However, after three months I was better: worse, John said one day, and he brought a doctor, but the man knew as well as I did-so he said nothing at all, and gave me some herb tea;-tell Aunt Martha that. 
                           "Then I could walk out of doors, but I did not care to; only once I smelt the hop-blossoms, and that I could not bear, so I went out and pulled up my hop-vine by the roots, and laid it out, all straight, in the fierce sunshine; it died directly. In the winter John had another wife sealed to him; I heard somebody say so; he did not tell me, and if he had I could not help it. I found he had taken a little adobe house for those two, and I knew it was out of tenderness for my feelings he did so. Oh! Uncle Field, perhaps he has loved me all this time? I know better, though, than that! Spring came, and I was very weak, and I grew not to care about anything; so I told John he could bring those two women to this house if he wished; I did not care, only nobody must ever come into my room. He looked ashamed, and pleased, too; but he brought them, and nobody ever did come into my room. By-and-by Elizabeth Colton brought a little baby down stairs, and its name was Clara. Poor child! poor little Mormon child! I hope it will die some time before it grows up; only I should not like it to come my side of heaven, for it had blue eyes like John's. 
                           "Then I grew more and more ill, and now I am really dying, and no letter has come from you! It takes so long-three whole months-and I have been more than a year in the house with John Henderson and the two women. I know I shall never see you, but I must speak. I must, even out of the grave; and I keep hearing the old fugue, 'The Lord is just, is just, is just; the Lord is just and good!' Is He? I know He is; but I forget sometimes. Uncle Field! you must pray for John! you must! I cannot die and leave him in his sins, his delusion; he does not think it is sin, but I know it. Pray! pray! dear Uncle! don't be discouraged;-do not fear-he will be undeceived some time; he will repent, I know! The Lord is just, and I will pray in heaven, and I will tell Nelly to, but you must. It says in the Bible, 'the prayer of a righteous man;' and oh! I am not righteous! I should not have married him; it was an unequal yoke, and I have borne the burden; but I loved him so much! Uncle Field, I did not keep myself from idols. Pray. I shall be dead, but he lives. Pray for him, and, if you will, for the little child-because-I am dying. Dear Nelly!"- 
                         
                      
                  
                
               "Are you blotting my letter, young man?" said Parson Field, at my elbow, as I deciphered the last broken, trembling line, of Ada's story. "Here I have been five minutes, and you did not hear me!" I really had blotted the letter! 
             
             
                
               VIII. THE RICH MERCHANT OF CAIRO. 
               A GREAT while ago-several hundred years at least-there lived in Cairo a rich merchant, whose name was Abdallah. He had other names besides, as is the custom there, but none that added to his reputation or credit. He was commonly called Abdallah the Rich, and sometimes Abdallah the Miserly. 
               From boyhood, almost, he had been engaged in traffic, and always successfully. Shift as it might, the wind was still favorable to some of his ships, and ventures which ruined other merchants overflowed his coffers with gold. The blue Mediterranean reflected the gleam of his sails. Nile, the father of rivers, was shadowed by the swarthy faces of the slaves who rowed his boats, and the burning sands of the desert were trampled by the feet of his caravans. His emissaries were known in the bazaars of Delhi and Damascus, in the spicy forests of Ceylon, and among the pearl-divers of the far Indian seas. They even traded, it is said, with the natives of Timbuctoo, the mysterious city whose existence has so often been denied. Abdallah, however, had never quitted Cairo, the city of his birth. He knew too well the dangers and hardships of travel to think of exposing his precious person to them. He had but to name a place to his agents, and say, "Go there," and they went. 
               His bazaars were in different parts of the city, but his house, like that of every good Turk, was in the Turkish Quarter. It was three stories in height, and the upper stories projected over the lower ones, casting a shadow even at noonday on the street below. The walls were originally white, with horizontal bars of crimson, like the stripes in a flag; but years had elapsed since they were painted, and they were kept in such bad repair that it was hard to say what color they really were-a smoky yellow, or a muddy red. 
               Along the front of the mansion, on a level with the floor of the two upper stories, ran a couple of balconies closely shut in with lattice-work. You see such lattices in most Oriental pictures; they are made of thin slips of wood like our lath, and cross each other diamond-wise. Save the arch over the door, which was elaborately carved, and illuminated with gold letters-a text from the Koran,-there was nothing about the outside of the house to stamp its owner a wealthy man. Inside, however, it was apparent, and all was rich and beautiful. 
               Like many other mean and selfish men, Abdallah was at heart sensual and luxurious. His floors were carpeted with the richest stuffs of the East, brilliant in dye, and soft as flowers to the feet. Where the marble pavement was seen, as it was in some rooms which were merely strewn with mats, it was cunningly inlaid with mosaics. Couches and divans softer than down lined the walls, and cabinets were filled with chiboques, and beautiful Persian pipes, whose water-bowls were buried in the long coil of their stems. 
               You passed from room to room by gliding between pillars, and by pushing aside curtains. Over the curtains rose magnificent arches of the finest and costliest workmanship. It would have made you feel proud just to walk beneath them, they were so grand, and yet so airy. Spicy cressets hung from the ceiling, and lanterns of divers colors dangled on golden chains. Pictures and statues there were none, both being forbidden by the Koran, but vases and cups abounded; vases of exquisite pattern, gold and silver, heaped with precious stones, pearls, rubies, and emeralds; and cups which a king might have drained. And Abdallah did drain them daily, so fond was he of his vault of old Greek wine. 
               But it was not within doors, after all, that the wealth of Abdallah was most manifest, but in his garden, which was the finest in all Cairo. It was situated at the back of the house, and was walled in with a high wall. A forest could not have been more shady and pleasant, so thick and leafy were the trees, palms, acacias, and sycamores, and so cool the winds imprisoned in their green retreats. The walks were hedged with roses and jessamines, and roofed with the branches of fruit-trees. Here hung the golden quince, there the bloom-cheeked peach, and there purple plums and red pomegranates. 
               In the centre of the garden was a kiosk, or Turkish summer-house, a miracle of grace and beauty. It was square, with four pillars on each side, and a fretted dome overhead. The pillars supported Saracenic arches, through which came gleams of the garden around, and the mingled scent of its flowers. From a black marble urn in the basin of the kiosk gushed a sparkling fountain, a broad silver shaft with a willowy base that dripped back into the urn, and over its rim into the bubbling ripples below. 
               It was a nook of delight, and a perfect nest of birds, the wondrous birds of the East. Some were inclosed in cages of sandal-wood and pearl, while others were as free as the air in which they wantoned. Peacocks strutted in and out, spreading their gorgeous trains; golden pheasants dreamed in the gloom of the dome; parrots chattered and swung on their rings, and birds-of-paradise, with sweeping rainbow tails, flew from perch to perch. Truly it was an enchanted place, that garden and house, and worthy of a better master than Abdallah. 
               Here Abdallah dwelt year after year. No one shared his enjoyments save his daughter, Zuleika, and she only when he was away. There was not much happiness in the house where Abdallah was, he was so selfish and exacting. It was impossible to please him. He thought of no one but himself, and his own gains and losses. He had a wonderful head for accounts, and could reckon untold sums as by instinct. He knew to a fraction how much every debtor owed him, and how much it cost him to just keep the life in his slaves. 
               When the business of the day was over, and he had smoked his bubbling pipe, and quaffed his cup of Greek wine, he used to shut himself up in his room and gloat over his gold. It was his god, and he recognised no other, except he wished to take a false oath. Then he was profuse of his "by Allahs," and "the holy beard of the Prophet!" 
               Such was the man Abdallah, and such his mode of life up to the morning when our story begins. Having a new scheme of gain on hand that morning, he rose earlier than usual, performed his customary ablutions, and prepared to depart for the market-place. Before setting forth, he allotted their day's work to his servants and slaves; then he charged his daughter Zuleika not to leave the house during his absence; and, finally, after he had made everybody as miserable as he could, he departed, and the door was barred behind him. 
               It was still early in Cairo, and but few of the better citizens had yet risen. The streets were filled with the poorest classes, and they jostled Abdallah in passing, He avoided them as much as possible, by picking the least-crowded thoroughfares, and keeping close to the houses. Here sauntered a water-carrier, with his jar poised on his head; and there marched a string of camels, bound for Siout and the desert. Artisans hurried to their work-snops, rubbing their eyes as they went; donkeys turned the corners suddenly, and almost knocked him down; and, to crown all, a pertinacious driver insisted on having his custom! He must have been a wag, or a stranger in Cairo, that driver, to have for a moment imagined that Abdallah the Miser would ride. He knew the value of money too well, however wearied he might be, to think of spending it in that way. The idea was absurd. 
               As I said before, the streets were filled with the poorest classes, and the short turn that Abdallah made to reach the market-place led him among their dwellings. He had but little time for observation, so intent was he in hatching his schemes, but he could not help seeing the filth and misery which surrounded him. The houses were in a ruinous and tumble-down condition; many of them without windows and doors-mere hovels-and their dwellers were in perfect keeping, lean, sallow, and ragged. 
               Few of the men were at home, for the day being a festival, promised an abundant alms; but he saw the women in the miserable rooms, and troops of squalid children. Some of the women were busy with household matters, kindling fires for the morning meal, and mending the rents in their garments: others sat in the ashes, supine and dejected, their long hair falling over their eyes, and over the infants on their bosoms. These were the mothers and grandmothers: if there were girls in the family they were generally at the windows, ogling the passers-by, and singing ribald songs to entice them in. 
               One among the number arrested the sight of Abdallah, she was so much like his own child Zuleika. She was just her height, although her figure was frailer; had the same black hair adorned with sequins, and the same lustrous large eyes and long lashes. Zuleika, however, lacked the mingled mirth and melancholy of her counterfeit; nor was she ever seen, like her, at the balcony unveiled. The likeness puzzled Abdallah, but he knew that Zuleika was safe at home, and his schemes came into his head again-so he passed on, and forgot it. 
               He had now reached a better portion of the city, although he was still in the Beggars' Quarter. He stopped in the public square, and gazed about him. His vision was bounded on all sides by the white wall of the city, and the fringe of palms overlooking it. An open country lay on the north-a region of gardens and grain-fields; on the south and west, the shining length of the Nile flecked with sails, and the pyramids that loomed through the haze of the Lybian desert. But the glory of the dawn was in the east, in the serene blue sky, and on the crests of the Mokattam hills, which were tipped with light. The sun had not yet risen, but the domes of the mosques were brightening, and the minarets burned with rosy flames. 
               The heart of Abdallah was glad within him, he hardly knew why, and he went on his way with a lighter and firmer step. To say that he was depressed by the Beggars' Quarter, or that he pitied its unfortunate dwellers, would show but little knowledge of a nature like his. Still, he felt happy in leaving them behind him, and in comparing his condition with theirs. 
               He drew near the market-place, in which his bazaars were held, when he was accosted by a beggar. 
               "I am poor," said the beggar; "it is two days now since I have tasted food." 
                
               "What is that to me?" inquired the merchant. 
               "Abdallah the Rich, I am poor and hungry, and I demand alms from thee!" 
               Abdallah started back amazed. He was not accustomed to demands; besides he had never before been mimicked as he was by the beggar; for the voice of the latter was an exact echo of his own. Nor did the imitation stop at his voice: form, features, gait, everything pertaining to Abdallah was reproduced with strange fidelity. It was as if he saw himself in a mirror, or stood beside himself in a dream! 
               There was a difference, though, between the beggar's garments and those of Abdallah. The merchant was dressed as became his station and wealth, in a flowing robe, with a rich sash around his waist, and a jewel-hilted dagger in his belt. His turban was a costly cashmere shawl, and his slippers were heavily embroidered with gold. The beggar was clad in rags which failed to hide his leanness, and he supported his tottering limbs with a long staff. His face was thin and ghastly, and his eyes, that burned with an unnatural lustre, were deeply sunken in their sockets. He was like Abdallah, and yet unlike; looking not so much as Abdallah did, as Abdallah might, should he by any chance become a beggar. 
               "Abdallah the Miserly," said the beggar, "you are rolling in abundance, while I am starving with want. Help me, or I die." 
               "You are mistaken in thinking me rich," said the covetous merchant. "True, I have the reputation of wealth, but everybody knows the uncertainty of a merchant's business. To-day he is rich, to-morrow poor. But, admitting that I am rich, my money is my own. I owe it entirely to my own exertions, and not to others. I cannot help you, so let me pass." 
                
               "But I am dying," persisted the beggar. 
               "Again I say, what is that to me?" 
               "Listen to me, Abdallah," said the excited beggar, shaking his skinny finger in the face of the merchant. "Listen to me, hard-hearted man, and tremble. You refuse me, your fellow-man, bread, and you arrogate to yourself your good fortune. These are deadly sins, and must be atoned for. God gave you prosperity; he can give you adversity as well. And he does; from this hour there is a spell upon you." 
               The merchant turned in wrath, and was about to smite the beggar, when he saw the Captain of the Sultan's Guard approaching in the distance. In spite of himself, he shuddered and turned pale. He did not for an instant believe the beggar's prophecy; but he knew that no man's life was safe, if it were known that he was rich, and the Sultan was in want of money. 
               "The curse is beginning to work, Abdallah," said the beggar, tauntingly; but Abdallah was to much troubled to hear him. He ran over in his mind all his late business transactions, to see how far the worst had infringed the law; wondered which one of his many agents was most likely to betray him; and whether, if the worst came to the worst, he could manage to escape with life. 
               "Perhaps I may escape even now," said he to himself: but no-the guard was too close. Besides, he reasoned, if I attempt flight, it will seem to confirm suspicion. But he could not have flown had he tried, for his feet were rooted to the ground. 
               He was a grim-looking fellow, the Captain of the Guard, and his manner of arresting Abdallah was not calculated to set the latter at ease. He drew his long sword with one hand, and clutched the merchant by the wrist with the other, while the soldiers sprang upon him from the opposite side, and pinioned his arms behind him. He was then marched off in the direction of the Sultan's palace. As might have been expected, his arrest drew together a crowd. First and foremost came the rabble from the Beggars' Quarter; children who broke off their plays to revile him; women who ran to see if it was their lovers or husbands; and numbers of the beggar-men, whom the news had already reached. 
               Among others, was the girl who looked so much like Zuleika. It was strange, but she was not in the least like Zuleika now. She had lustrous eyes, long lashes, and black hair, adorned with sequins; but her face was haggard with sensuality, and distorted with indecent mirth. She was no more like Zuleika-the pure and beautiful Zuleika-than a wandering comet, a hell of aerial fire is like the moon, the silver Eden of night. 
               "This is marvellous, this change," thought Abdallah; and the beggar coming into his mind, he turned his head to see if the beggar was changed also; and lo! he had vanished. 
               The guard and their prisoner had now reached the Sultan's palace. It was a holiday in Cairo, and the square was filled with soldiers. Bodies of black troops were drawn up in files on each side, while the centre was filled by the dignitaries of the empire; bashaws of distant provinces, white-bearded old sheiks of desert tribes, and daring Mamelukes. Beside the palace-gate, stood two gigantic Nubian slaves, the executioners of the Sultan, one swinging his bowstring, the other poising his immense scymitar. 
               The gates were thrown open, and the Sultan came forth to judgment. The Commander of the Faithful was mounted on a superb Arab barb, whose neck arched proudly, and whose step disdained the earth. His turban was covered with jewels, and it shone like a constellation under his cloudy plume. His caftan was green, the sacred color, but his sash was deep red. It was an ominous color with the Commander of the Faithful, for it generally betokened the shedding of blood. So his court approached him with terror, kissing his robe, and even the ground before him. "Long life to the Shereef! May God prolong his days!" 
               Casting his eyes over the prostrate crowd, the Commander of the Faithful saw Abdallah kneeling in the custody of the Captain of the Guard. He summoned the latter, and as he drew near, dragging the helpless culprit, beckoned to the executioners. Behold Abdallah between them, in front of the Sultan. 
               "Long life to the Shereef! May God prolong his days!" 
               "We have heard of this man," said the Commander of the Faithful; "does any here know him? It is said that he is rich, very rich. It is also said that his riches are ill-gotten. If he has wronged any here, even a slave, let the wronged man step forth, and accuse him. By the beard of my father, he shall have justice!" 
               The words of the Sultan passed from mouth to mouth till they reached the ears of a merchant who was passing the palace. Emboldened by the Sultan's permission, he accused Abdallah. 
               "Commander of the Faithful, the merchant Abdallah owes me five purses of gold, which he refuses to pay. He came to me one day, accompanied by a strange merchant, who, he said, was his friend; and who wished to purchase sandal-wood and gums. I sold him five purses' worth, Abdallah agreeing to pay for the same, in case his friend did not. Twelve moons have passed since there, and I have not seen the merchant, nor will Abdallah pay me the debt." 
                
               "Your case is hard," said the Sultan; "but we cannot help you. The law will do you justice, if you can prove your claim. We give you a purse of gold that you may prosecute it freely." 
               The next accuser was one of the Mamelukes. 
               "Commander of the Faithful, this shop-keeper lately sold me a sword for a true Damascus blade. I paid him his price without higgling, and went forth to battle with the enemies of the Prophet. We were hard pushed by the accursed Giaours, and fell before them like ripe grain. A boy, whom I could have slain with the wind of a good scymitar, engaged me; and, snapping my sword like a reed, gave me this ugly gash on the cheek. I have no sword now. Here is the hilt of my famous Damascus blade," and he threw it at the feet of the Sultan's barb; "give me another, Master, and I will punish the lying shop-keeper." 
               "You are a brave fellow, Mameluke," said the Sultan, unbuckling his own sword, and handing it to the soldier; "wear this, and smite the Giaours. Leave the shopkeeper to us." 
               The soldier fell back in the ranks, and the Sultan made a sign to the slave with the bowstring, who seized Abdallah, and prepared to strangle him. 
               The next accuser was one of the desert sheiks. 
               "Seven years ago," he said, "there was a famine among my people. The tidings reached Cairo, and this dog sent his agents amongst us loaded with corn, not to relieve our wants, but to rob us of our flocks and herds. He built granaries in our midst, and tortured us with the sight of food which few were rich enough to buy. We implored the assistance of other merchants, and many attempted to help us, but he drove them all from the field, some by bribery, and some by underselling, till, at last, no one would venture against him. The souls of our dead cry out for justice-justice on the corn-selling dog!" 
               "We, too, have a cause of complaint," said the Commander of the Faithful, after a score or two had finished accusing Abdallah. "This jewel," and he plucked one from his turban, "was sold us by the merchant for a pure diamond, and it turns out to be a bit of glass. We gave him a thousand purses for what is not worth a piastre. To punish him for the cheat we confiscate his estates for the Prophet's treasury, and we seize his daughter for the imperial harem. As for the wretch himself he shall become a slave. We give him to your tribe," said the Sultan, turning to the desert sheik: "It is just that he should suffer, even as he has made others. The dog is no longer Abdallah the Merchant, but Abdallah the Slave. God is great!" 
               "Long life to the Shereef! May God prolong his days!" 
               The Sultan shook the reins of his barb, and rode down the square, accompanied by his bashaws and sheiks. The Mamelukes and black troops remained, together with Abdallah and the executioners. There was no danger now in insulting him, and they made the most of the opportunity. The Mamelukes began by robbing him of everything valuable. One snatched his turban, another his sash, a third his jewel-hilted dagger, and the fourth the purse which he vainly attempted to conceal; the rest, meanwhile, rode around him and pricked him with the points of their long spears. He was then handed over to the soldiers, and buffeted about till his bones ached. When the sheik returned for his slave he found him in a sorry plight, for he was covered with blood and bruises, and his garments were torn to tatters. Could his counterfeit and second self, the vanished beggar, have seen him then, even he must have pitied him, he was so ragged and forlorn. 
               It pleased the sheik to ride through Cairo before he started for the desert, and the whim seized him to make Abdallah lead his camel. The slave walked before his master, sullen and slow, the string of the camel slack in his hand, and his eyes fixed on the ground. Turn which way he would he was blasted by the sight of human faces. Men of all ranks and conditions rejoiced at his abasement. Children climbed up arches and gateways to get a glimpse of him; citizens pointed him out to strangers, and veiled women peered at him from latticed balconies. Many of his debtors were present, and merry enough they were, too. It was not every day that they could pay their debts so easily! 
               After traversing the principal streets of the city, passing squares, markets, and bazaars, the sheik halted to make room for a procession. First came a file of soldiers loaded with swords and daggers, and, armfuls of sashes and shawls; then a row of black slaves, each with a jar of gold or jewels on his head; and lastly, the head eunuch, leading a veiled girl, who trembled under her veil! The heart of the slave sunk within him. It was the spoil of his own bazaars which the Sultan had just seized, and his own child Zuleika on her way to the accursed harem! A mist swam before the eyes of the wretched man; he staggered a step, and fell senseless in the dust. 
               When he came to himself he was travelling with a caravan, for the tribe whose slave he had become were journeying back to the desert. The sheik rode at their head, and Abdallah led his camel over the sand. 
               An ocean of yellow sand stretched away on all sides till it reached the edge of the horizon. Not a tree or plant was to be seen anywhere, not even a blade of grass. The sky was without a cloud, intensely blue and bright, and the sun a perfect glare of light. 
               Sometimes they followed the track of former caravans, trampling in the footprints of men and camels; at others, they struck out a path for themselves, making the faraway mountains landmarks. 
               The road was frequently strewn with bones, the skeletons of men and camels, some of whom were overthrown by whirling clouds of sand, while others must have perished from starvation. 
               One skeleton in particular impressed Abdallah, and made him thoughtful for a long time. It lay in advance of the multitude, and beside it was a broken water-cruse. He picked up a fragment of the cruse, and saw its owner's name engraved under the mark of the potter. The dead man was one of his own agents, a trusty Egyptian, who started on a long journey for him, and never returned. "He met his fate in the desert," thought Abdallah; "he was starved to death that I might increase my gains. I remember now that his wife told me this, but I feigned to think it false, and refused her a single piastre. I am punished now, for I am in the desert myself. Allah forbid that his fate should be mine!" 
               He cast his eyes over the sea of rolling sand, and sighed aloud. Up to this time, and it was now the second day of the journey, he had made no complaint; but now his limbs began to fail him from excessive weariness. The hot sand burnt his tender feet; the waste of flint, into which the caravan had come, cut him to the very bone, and his steps were marked with blood. 
               In the afternoon the caravan halted at a valley well, and pitched their tents for the night. The valley was a mere gully, the bed of some ancient river, and the well a pit of brackish water. A stunted palm rustled in the burning air, and a few brave tufts of grass disputed the supremacy of the sand. It was a dreary place, but it seemed a garden to the weary Abdallah. 
               The camels were fed and tethered for the night; the sheik and his sons sat cross-legged in the tent and related marvellous tales: the slaves huddled together, and sang wild songs in strange tongues: but Abdallah stood alone in the shade of the palm. His first impulse was flight, but a glance at his swollen feet convinced him of its utter folly. Had he needed anything else to deter him, he could have found it in the hyena tracks which surrounded the valley. 
               He threw himself under the stunted palm, and strove to forget the change in his fortune. He was no longer Abdallah the slave, nor yet Abdallah the merchant, but Abdallah the man-a man alone with nature. 
               The stars were out by thousands, sparkling in the deep blue sky, and the moon lifted her horn above the rim of the desert. The first news that Abdallah had of her presence was a long ray of light which she shot full in his eyes. He turned his head aside, and it glinted on the surface of the well. A second followed it, and discovered what the dusk had for some time concealed, the dusky faces of the slaves as they sang their strange wild songs. Then Abdallah saw the white tent of the sheik, and the group of tethered camels, and then the stretch of desert beyond. 
               There was something in the moonlight which made everything it shone upon beautiful, even the stern old sheik who came to the door of his tent to watch the slaves. It softened the heart of Abdallah and filled him with tender and dreamy thoughts. He remembered how often he had seen it shining on the mosques and domes of Cairo, and how it flooded the walks of his garden, and dripped from the walls of his beloved kiosk. Then his fancy wandered, as a moonlight fancy sometimes will, to ruinous old houses, and he saw the Beggars' Quarter as it was on the previous morning. The houses were old still, with walls and chimneys leaning to a fall; yet their decay seemed in some degree repaired, for the chinks and doors were closed, he knew not how, while the windows were curtained with white. 
               "If the moonlight does so much for the beggars' houses," thought Abdallah, "what might not human kindness do for the beggars?" It was a manly thought, and it ennobled even while it grieved him. He pondered over his past life, its narrow selfishness and blindness, and giving himself up to the influences around, was initiated into the mysteries of Nature. And the first thing that the universal mother taught him was that nothing exists for itself alone. He saw, in thought, the moon and stars shining on the earth, and the earth baring her brow to receive their light, giving her own in return. The land gradually crumbled into the sea on one side of the world, while the sea as gradually withdrew its waters from the land on the other. The clouds covered the mountains with snow; the snow melted and formed rivers; the rivers with mist fed the clouds; and the clouds turned into snow, and again covered the mountains. The dew crept into the heart of the flowers, and the flowers breathed their fragrance to the falling dew. Innumerable were the examples of Nature, that it is necessary to give, as well as to receive. Yes, and even to give when there is no hope of receiving in return. "The desert, for instance," thought Abdallah, "what can the sun hope to gain by shining on its rocks and billows of sand? For leagues there is no living thing, save now and then a scorpion, or a straggling blade of grass. Yet the sun shines as generously there as in the gardens of Cashmere, and the stars and the queenly moon brighten the solitude with their luminous smiles! And the great God of the heavens, the infinite and everlasting Allah, who made and overlooks the worlds-of what avail to Him are the prayers and the lives of even the holiest? Yet the hands of the great Father are always stretched forth with blessings and bounties, and his ears are always open to the cries of his children." 
               "I have not performed my part," said Abdallah sadly, "as God and Nature perform theirs, but from this hour I will amend my life. I have not fallen in vain since I have learned to fulfil my duty. God is great!" 
               He rose from his seat beneath the palm, and walked to the edge of the valley, where he saw a stunted colocynth growing alone in the sand. Curiosity impelled him to view it closer, and he hastened to it, although it grew in the midst of the hyena tracks. Stooping on his hands and knees he brushed the sand from it, and found that it was dying for want of moisture. Its leaves were shrivelled with heat, and the poor melon which it strove to shelter was fairly wilted on the stem. It was a worthless plant at best, so bitter that no animal could eat it; but its forlorn condition touched the heart of Abdallah, and retracing his steps to the well he proceeded to water it, using for that purpose a fragment of the broken cruse which he picked up in the desert. That done, he bowed his head to the Holy City, and said the prayers of the Faithful, and, creeping among the camels, he was soon fast asleep. 
               The caravan rose at dawn, and resumed their march. The first good deed of Abdallah repaid him well, for the colocynth was green and fresh. It waved its leaves to him at parting, and the shine of its yellow melon was brighter than gold. 
               The sky above, and the sand below; a desert of blue, and a desert of yellow. In the upper desert marched the sun, showering abroad his spears of fire, in the under desert the sheik and his tribe, vainly endeavoring to ward them off. 
               Sun, and sand, and hot wind. Fragments of bleaching bones. A winding string of men and camels, and a solitary swooping kite! 
               About noon they were startled by a mirage. It was the first that Abdallah had ever seen, and he marvelled greatly thereat. It grew up from the sand suddenly, and assumed the shape of a band of roving Bedouins, a tribe of desert robbers, mounted on flying stallions, and armed with long spears which they brandished furiously. 
               Then it became the house of Abdallah, a perfect picture of his lost mansion in Cairo. Like that, its walls were striped with red; its balconies shaded the street; the fountain played in its kiosk; and a mock Zuleika walked in the shade of its unreal trees! 
               Its third change was into the Beggars' Quarter, which seemed more wretched, if that were possible, than when Abdallah saw it last. Some of the houses had fairly tumbled down, nearly all the windows and doors were gone, and the squalid wretches had multiplied in every room. Parents had strangled their children, and were weeping for them; children had grown up, and were beating their parents; and the girl with sequins in her hair-she lay stone dead in the street! 
               Then the mirage surrounded Abdallah, and became the very square in which he was stopped by the beggar. He stared down the long streets, and saw the white wall of the city, and the fringe of palms overlooking it. Gardens and grain-fields barred the north; on the south and west ran the Nile, alive with glancing sails. The Mokattam hills were flooded with light, and the mosques and minarets blazed with rosy flames. It was too like Cairo, not to be Cairo itself! Abdallah rubbed his eyes, like a man awaking ing from a dream, and found to his great joy that he had not stirred from the square. The beggar still stood before him, holding out his hand for alms, and in the distance he saw the Captain of the Sultan's Guard! Hardly a moment had elapsed, and yet Abdallah had passed through so many changes of fortune. It was like the prophet's living in the seventh heaven seventy thousand years, while a drop of water was falling from his pitcher to the ground. 
               "I have not dreamed in vain," said the thankful and humbled merchant, "for I have learned to perform my duty. Here, my brother, is alms for thee," and he gave the beggar a piece of gold; "depart in peace, and be happy. For me-I will go and pray. God is Great!" 
               "God is Great!"-the muezzins took up the cry, and passed it from minaret to minaret, till the morning wind was vocal with the sound. The faithful heard it in their houses, and came pouring into the streets, and sought the nearest mosque. Every man drew the slippers from his feet, and, crossing the sacred threshold, worshipped God and the Prophet. There were many solemn prayers said that day, and many grateful men in Cairo, but none that were more devout than Abdallah the Merchant. 
               "For, by the grace of God," he said, "I am still Abdallah the Merchant, and not Abdallah the Slave." 
             
             
                
               IX. THE LEGEND OF GOODMAN POVERTY. 
               ONE day I was so fortunate as to discover an old traditionary relic of great beauty; the legend and its title running as follows: 
               "The new and pleasant history of Goodman Poverty; showing who Poverty was, where he had his origin, in what fashion he dealt with Death, and when he will come to an end in the world." 
               Saint Peter and Saint Paul, overtaken suddenly by a great storm, once upon a time, when they were journeying together, came to the outskirts of a village, where, at first sight, they perceived only a rich man's house, so grand that they hesitated to enter it. 
               "It seems to me, in my poor judgment," said Saint Peter, "that it would be well, before knocking at the gate of this grand house, to try and learn in the neighborhood what manner of person the master may be; and whether he be really a man of substance, and well to do in the world; for this is a point upon which one is often mistaken. No matter how handsome the houses we see by the wayside, we generally find that those who call themselves their owners are over head and ears in debt; owing their fine dwellings, and all that they contain, to their creditors, and not possessing, in reality, a farthing of their own to bless themselves with." 
               Saint Paul fully agreed in this prudent view of the case but he was hungry, and cast his eyes about in every direction, seeking some one of whom to make the necessary inquiries. At length he exclaimed, joyfully, "I see a woman washing linen in yonder pool; I will go and ask her if she knows anything of the master of the house." 
               So saying, he approached the washerwoman, and accosting her very politely, "Good-day to you, dame," said he; "this is a heavy rain that we are having to-day!" 
               "Sooth, and ye may well say so, master," replied the woman, without stopping her work, "and 'tis lucky for me 'tis only water, for if it were wine it would hardly suit my washing; but then, to be sure, we might have a brave drinking bout, and after that lay up a good store in the cellar." 
               "Ye are merry, methinks, good dame!" returned Saint Paul. 
               "And wherefore not?" quoth the washerwoman. "Thank God, I lack nothing that a woman need wish for, except, to be sure, now and then a little money." 
               "Money!" cried the Saint; "ah, you are very fortunate in having no money, and being able to do without it." 
               "Aye, aye, that's all very well to say," returned the Washerwoman; "but, for all the harm that money has ever done to me, I may say that I shouldn't mind seeing a little more of it!" 
               "I see you like to have your joke, my good dame," continued the Saint; "but I assure you that money causes the ruin of a vast number of souls; and that it were to be wished, for the good of very many people, that they might never behold a coin all the days of their life." 
               "As for me," said the washerwoman, "I am too busy to do much wishing; and a crown so seldom comes in my way that I never had the chance to look at one long enough to make out the pictures upon it." 
                
               Saint Peter, who had been standing all this time under an oak, where he had taken refuge from the rain, grew impatient at hearing this long conversation, and begged Saint Paul to come away at once, and seek some better shelter. So they went up to the gate of the mansion, and lifted the knocker; but the master of the house put his head out of the window and bade them begone. 
               "This is no inn, fellows," cried he, roughly; "off with you this moment, and look for lodgings elsewhere!" And with this he shut the window, and turned scornfully away. 
               But the poor travellers were now drenched to the skin, and their forlorn plight touched the washerwoman's heart with pity. 
               "I wish I could take ye home with me," said she; "I would do so with right good-will; for ye seem to be decent, honest folk; but I dare not ask ye in, for I am a widow, and the neighbors would talk. But if ye will have patience a bit, while I finish my washing, I will presently take ye to the house of one of the townspeople, Poverty by name, who lives at the further end of the village, and who will gladly give ye a night's lodging." 
               Accordingly, as soon as the washing was done, the woman led Saint Peter and Saint Paul to Poverty's cottage, as she had promised to do. 
               It was but a little past sundown, and yet the Goodman was already gone to bed. 
               "Halloo, Poverty!" cried the washerwoman, going close up to the window; "here are two poor travellers who have been caught in the storm, and who know not where to lay their heads!" 
               Goodman Poverty had no sooner heard that these poor people wanted a night's lodging than he lifted the latch, and bade them come in. "Light the lamp, neighbor," said he to the washerwoman, as she stepped across the threshold. 
                
               Saint Peter and Saint Paul now entered the cottage. Everything in the house was topsy-turvy; one could distinguish nothing for the confusion; and the master himself tall, thin, withered, and pale, looked as though he had just come out of a sepulchre. 
               "God be praised for the shelter of this roof, and may his blessing descend upon it!" said St. Peter. 
               "Amen!" responded Poverty; "so mote it be! In sooth, my masters, I should have great need of his blessing, to be able to offer you any supper; for I have not so much as a morsel of bread in the house." 
               But the washerwoman, who had expected as much, now opened a basket which she had brought with her, and produced four fine large whitings, ready fried, a great brown loaf, and a pitcher of wine. 
               "Ah, Lord! bread and fish, as I live!" cried Saint Paul, greatly delighted. 
               "Thank ye kindly, dame," said Saint Peter; "we only asked for a roof to cover us, and you give us also this good supper. The Lord reward you for all the trouble you have taken!" 
               "Bah!" cried the washerwoman, setting out the food on the rickety table; "a morsel before sleeping never yet did harm to anybody; and, for my part, I am well paid in being able to offer your friend something to his mind." 
               They now seated themselves at the table, and began to eat with good appetites; all but Poverty, who was sad because of something that had happened to him that very afternoon. The poor man possessed nothing in the world but his cottage, and the little paddock, about as long as your arm, that lay behind it, and in which grew a fine pear-tree; but the hedge round this paddock was not much harder to get through than a spider's web, and certain marauders from the neighborhood had taken advantage of this bad state of the hedge to get through into the paddock, and rob the pear-tree, whose fruit formed the Goodman's sole revenue. This was why he had gone to bed supperless, vexed to the heart at seeing the half of his crop stolen from him; and his trouble was still so great that he could not touch a mouthful of the four large whitings, ready fried, the great loaf, and the pitcher of wine, with which his guests were regaling themselves. When the supper was over, Saint Peter, looking at Saint Paul, said to him, in a low voice: "This poor man's sorrow really excites my compassion; we must pray for him." 
               "Indeed, sirs," said Poverty, who had overheard what was said, "I should be very much obliged to you if you would do so; as for me, it is plain that my prayers have very little credit with Heaven, seeing I cannot find any way of bettering the miserable condition in which you find me." 
               "The Lord sometimes tries the just for their good," said Saint Peter; "it may be that He is thus trying you; but have you any particular favor to ask of Him?" 
               "The rogues who have robbed my pears have made me so angry," replied the Goodman, "that, if I might have my way, I would ask that all those who climb up into my pear-tree might be forced to stay there as long as I choose to keep them." 
               "That is certainly contenting yourself with very little," replied Saint Peter. 
               "Not so little as you may think," rejoined Poverty; "what joy for me to see a rogue stuck up there on a branch, unable to budge, and begging for mercy!" 
               "Well," replied Saint Peter, "if the Lord condescends to listen to the voice of His servants (which He does), you may be sure that your wish will be granted; for we shall do our very best for you, in the way of praying." 
                
               All that night did Saint Peter and Saint Paul remain on their knees in prayer; they would not take a moment's repose, notwithstanding the good offices of Poverty, who, in order to furnish them each with a couch, had divided into three parts the bundle of straw that formed his bed. But when the morning was come, Saint Peter and Saint Paul informed their charitable host that his wish was granted; and then, Poverty having shaken them heartily by the hand (although he could not help fearing that they were only making game of him), they left the cottage, and went on their way. 
               But lo and behold! next morning, when Poverty was coming back with his pitcher from the well, he espied a good-for-nothing varlet from the village stuck fast in the pear-tree, working his arms and legs about with might and main, and looking for all the world like a bird caught fast in the lime. 
               "Aha! villain! I have thee!" cried Poverty; "but, good Heaven, what manner of men were they who came to me last night! As for thee, thou rascally thief, I shall keep thee up there, and treat thee just as thou deservest. In the first place I shall call the whole village together, and then I shall kindle a good fire of straw, and roast thee like a sucking-pig!" 
               Thereupon the thief begged hard for mercy, offering to pay, at the very least, the worth of ten crops of pears. 
               "No, no; don't trouble thyself to offer me money," answered Poverty; "I am poor enough, Heaven knows; but, nevertheless, I prefer to pay myself after my own fashion. Wait just the least little half-quarter of an hour; I shall soon have gathered fagots enough to give thy hide a good singeing! Aha! thou lovest fine, juicy pears! I'll cure thee of thy thirst for them, thou rascal!" 
               Away went Poverty to gather straw and sticks for his fire; and, when he was gone, the thief cried for help with all the force he could muster, and so lustily that he drew to the spot two wood-cutters, who were going home from the forest. 
               "Why, what art doing up there, Nicholas?" inquired the men. 
               "That wicked old wizard, Poverty, for he is a wizard, has put a spell on me," replied the thief; "here am I, glued fast to the tree, and all because of a few miserable pears, forsooth, that I had eaten, being very thirsty!" 
               Thereupon the wood-cutters began to amuse themselves at the caitiff's expense; joking him for the fright he was in, and declaring that Poverty was but a sorry sort of wizard, after all; "for otherwise," said they, "he would have had the wit to mend his own fortune, and keep himself from starving long ago!" 
               Having delivered themselves of this piece of reasoning, and wishing to help Nicholas down from his perch, they climbed up into the tree, thinking to set the vagabond at liberty; but they would sooner have torn his arms from his body than have got him loose from the bough. 
               "Faith, lad, there's no help for it," said the wood-cutters; "all we can do for thee is, to go to the squire." 
               But when they would have got down out of the tree, they found themselves caught just as fast as Nicholas; so that Poverty, on coming back a few minutes after, with a great bundle of brushwood and fagots, found, as he thought, three pear-thieves in his tree, instead of one! 
               "Aha!" cried he, with a chuckle; "the fair goes on bravely, I see; there's no lack of traders! very good, my fine fellows; just stay where you are; in two minutes I shall smoke you all like so many herrings!" 
               "Excellent Poverty," began both the wood-cutters together, while their tears trickled down to the very foot of the tree, "look at us, we beseech of you, and you will see that we are good neighbors of yours; indeed, and in truth, we only got up into this cursed tree to help Nicholas down." 
               "Don't tell me," cried Poverty; "no, no; you wanted to steal my pears!" 
               "But, good Poverty, we never passed for thieves in all the country-side; we have pear-trees in our own gardens that bear pears quite as fine as these. And even had we neither pear-trees nor pears, had we wanted any, the market is not far off, and we could get our fill of them for a few farthings." 
               "If what you say is true," replied Poverty, "you may come down; the punishment is only meant for thieves." 
               And, in sooth, the two wood-cutters found themselves suddenly let loose, and were able to jump down to the ground; whereupon the first thing they did was to intercede for the rascal who remained in the tree, as frightened and weary as a toad in a wine-vat. 
               "It's no use begging for him," cried Poverty; "no, no; he shall stay up there a year for every pear he has stolen!" 
               But the wood-cutters, nothing daunted, pleaded so well, and the poor man's heart was so rich in charity, that at last he consented to forgive the thief on condition that, for the future, he never came within a hundred paces of the little garden; but the vagabond swore that he would never again be seen within even a league of the cottage, so terrible did the Very sight of the pear-tree now seem to him. 
               Moreover, the noise of this adventure soon spread abroad in the village, and frightened the people so much, that no one ever again sought to rob Poverty of his pears; the very children, bold as they generally are and greedy of fruit, would on no account have even thrown a stone up into the tree, for they were still more afraid of this pear-tree than of the wolf that ate up little Red Riding Hood. 
               For a long space, Poverty lived merrily, and his heart rejoiced within him whenever he looked at his pear-tree, so green, and so thriving, laden with red and yellow fruit, that stood him in place of everything else; but the years passed on, and the Goodman's head was covered with snow. From time to time sickness took hold of him. 
               One day there was a tap at the cottage-door, and Poverty opened it to see who was there. It was Death. 
               Now many people are troubled on beholding the King of the country of Clatter-bones, but Poverty was not a whit afraid of him, for he had nothing amiss on his conscience, and had always lived an honest man, though a poor one. 
               "What! art thou not afraid of me?" cried Death, very much astonished; "of me, before whom popes, kings, and emperors tremble!" 
               "You do not frighten me the least in the world," answered Poverty. "What pleasure have I in this life, that I should not also quit it with pleasure? I have neither wife nor children; in sooth, I have had trouble enough without that sort of fry to take care of; I have not the worth of a farthing, except my cottage and my pear-tree, which is, as I may say, a nursing mother to me, through the fine fruit it gives me every year. See! it is now covered with pears, and the only sorrow I have in setting eyes on you, is the thought of being obliged to leave it without having first eaten this year's crop. Unluckily, you are one of those gentry with whom it is no use talking, otherwise I should beg you to let me take one good bite out of my finest pear; after that I should be quite ready to follow you." 
                
               "What thou sayest seems to me very reasonable," said Death; "go and gather the fruit for thyself." 
               Hereupon Poverty, with Death following close at his heels, stepped out into the paddock, and walked round and round the tree, seeking out the finest pear. 
               "I see one that looks very ripe and red," cried he, at last; "but how high it hangs! However, if I might make bold to borrow your worship's scythe for a moment, I think I should be able to get at the branch." 
               "Oh, as to my scythe," replied Death, "I never lend that to anybody; but it seems to me, it would be better to gather this pear by hand, lest it should get bruised in the falling." 
               "You are certainly right," returned Poverty; "it would be altogether better; but my poor old bones have grown stiff of late, and I cannot climb it as I could at fifteen." 
               "Well," said Death, "I'll go up myself, and gather for thee this fine pear, from which thou thinkest to have so much pleasure;" and so saying he clambered up into the pear-tree. 
               "Hallo!" cried Death, "but what is it that is taking; hold of me? Why, I can't get down." 
               "As, to that," returned Poverty, very coolly, "that's your affair, not mine. Why did you come to my cottage? You have the whole world to, mow in, and yet you must needs come poking into my miserable hovel, to take the life of one who never did you any harm." 
               "Darest thou trifle thus with me!" cried Death. "Bethink thee to what thou exposest thyself!" 
               "I've bethought me of all that, already," replied Poverty, "and I'm not in the least afraid of you. I have you fast in my pear-tree, old gentleman, and there you shall stay. I shall thus be doing a great service to a lot of other honest folk whom you meant to visit to-day." 
                
               Death, who never before had found himself in such a strait, saw at once that there must be something unearthly about this tree. "I have deserved what has happened," said he to himself, "by a piece of condescension quite out of my usual way. But let me tell thee," cried he, addressing himself to Poverty, "thou wilt gain nothing by thus setting thyself against the will of Heaven. If it be the Lord's pleasure that thou quit this life, he will make thee quit it, in spite of all thou canst do; and besides, if thou dost not let me come down of thine own free will, I shall very soon have killed thy pear-tree with my scythe." 
               "Pshaw!" returned Poverty; "whether my pear-tree be living or dead, you don't come out of it except at my pleasure, and that won't be very soon, I promise you." 
               "Why did I ever set my foot in this plaguy dwelling?" said Death to himself; "I had plenty to do in the four corners of the earth, without coming here. Thou wilt repent of this day's business," cried he to Poverty, "when it is too late." 
               "I shall do no such thing," replied Poverty; "he who is afraid of dying, is also above the fear of many other things. Your threats do not cause me the slightest alarm, and I am quite ready to start for the other world when the Master shall call me." 
               "Thou may'st boast thyself, Goodman, to be the first who has ever vanquished Death. Heaven orders me, with thy leave, to quit thee, and not to come back to thee until the day of doom, when I shall have finished my great work." 
               "Is it not to cheat me, that you speak to me thus?" asked Poverty. 
               "No," replied Death, "I swear to thee that thou shalt see me no more until the desolation of all nature shall be accomplished; it is thou who shalt receive the last stroke of my scythe." 
               "In that case," returned Poverty, "you may come down from the tree." 
               Death did not wait to be told twice, but flew away through the air, and Poverty has never heard another word from him to this day. It is true that Death has often come back to the village, and has carried off even the most respectable people, but he flies past the Goodman's cottage, as though the pest were in it. 
               Poverty has lived on ever since, in the same humble way, under the shadow of his beloved pear-tree; and Poverty will still live on in the world as long as the world shall last. 
             
             
                
               X. THE DOUBLE VEIL. 
               "MY dear sir," said a pale gentleman in a well-fitting black suit, touching my elbow and addressing me abruptly, as I stood looking over the taffrail of the Stonington steamer-"My dear sir, never, on any account, buy food of old people, nor practice impositions on cats." 
               "Why," I answered, laughing, "I don't intend to practice impositions either on cats or men; but I see no reason why edibles vended by an old person, should not be as savory and as properly salable as others." 
               "Especially if you are peddling," continued my new friend, with a smile; "especially if you are peddling. I'll tell you the reason, if you like, and I think it will please you; for there is really a good deal of truth in this advice of mine." 
               It is a good plan to tolerate all manner of queer self-introductions. I have gathered many singular stories, and much useful information and new truth, from fellow-travellers of easy manners and a cacothes loquendi. So I answered that I should be extremely happy to listen to the account which my friend, seemed prepared to furnish, whereupon he proceeded to narrate the following: 
               "While I was engaged in the peddling business, ten or fifteen years ago, in the rough country including those portions of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina, which are nearest each other, I was in the habit of putting up at a solitary frame house, on the mountains in East Tennessee. It was inhabited by two poor creatures, a man and his wife; old, decrepit, and scarcely able to crawl. They had a small garden, and an enormous tomcat; in both of which they took very great pride. They raised a little corn, and a few vegetables; but for other housekeeping comforts and necessaries, they depended upon chance passengers, peddlers, immigrants, hunters, etc. The house was full twenty miles from any other on the road, either way, and the route was extremely rough. How these two feeble old mortals should ever have settled there, or how they should dare to stay so long, I'm sure I can't imagine. Their nearest neighbors used to tell queer stories about the old place, as if it had formerly been the haunt of horse-thieves, negro-stealers, counterfeiters, and that riff-raff of miscellaneous miscreants that gathers now and then in the West and South; and as if the old man, and his old wife had been implicated in many dark deeds, and lived there, by a retributive imprisonment, in the place of their ancient crimes. But of all this, I never saw any indications. I repeatedly passed the night there in safety, even when having property and money to a considerable amount with me. The old folks, to be sure, were 'as cross as two sticks;' but they served me as well as they could. Besides, I was pretty well used to serve myself; and it was one good sign, that they evidently loved their enormous old tomcat as if it had been an only child. There was only one thing about them which positively displeased me, and that was their terrible avarice. I always paid them well, for they were poor, and needed the money. And the grin and clutch with which they seized the cash, and the gloating delight which they felt, seemingly, even in handling the coins, were ugly and hateful to see. 
                
               "Well, I always used to put up there, because it was almost necessarily my stopping-place, in getting across one of the twisted combinations of mountain ranges that shut off the western part of North Carolina from Tennessee. These visits occurred at irregular intervals during several years, while I was on my circuit in that section of country. I could see that the old couple grew weaker and weaker, and their horrid avarice stronger and stronger. They even used to give way, latterly, to unpleasant demonstrations of maudlin affection at my coming, apparently for no other reason than that they expected handsome payment for my board and lodgings. And the great old cat, though coy at first, ultimately took up a cattish and freaky liking to me; rubbing himself against my boot, purring and looking up and winking slowly at me with his big, green eyes, and even scrambling up into my lap to go to sleep, and lying and kneading and digging his sharp claws into me, as a token of amity, after the fashion of amicable cats. 
               "I had stopped there one night, towards the end of the summer; and after partaking of an unusually meagre supper and breakfast, departed, leaving the poor old man and his wife mumbling and grinning to each other over a dollar or two which I gave them, as much in charity as in payment. 
               "I mused much, as I went, upon the unaccountable change in the behavior of the old cat He had forgotten all his feline blandishments, and of my caresses and attentions he would none; spitting and swelling up in a manner very ugly to behold, developing his great yellow tail into a cylindrical brush almost as large as his body, arching his back and striking spitefully at me with his claws out at full length, whenever I tried to be friendly. The old woman scolded, and the old man swore; until finally he threw a couple of old boots and a broom at torn, who evacuated the kitchen, went out and perched on the woodpile, and commenced a horrid and persistent grand solo cat's-concert, calculated to dismay the boldest heart. He wauled and miauled all the evening. He carried on imaginary conflicts with intrusive rivals, and amorous cooings-if one may imagine a tomcat to coo-with lady-lovers; and he kept me awake nearly all night, in spite of the expenditure of all the missiles I could muster in my cracklit attic bedroom. 
               "Nor was he improved in the morning. His unmelodious notes seemed to have been aggravated by his serenading-singing in the night, you know, is very trying to the voice-and I fancy he must have caught a cold in the head, from sitting undressed on a damp log; for his eyes were considerably inflamed, and were now horribly red and fiery, and his vile crowing and screeching was as hoarse and harsh as a sick Shanghai's. All the time that I was eating my scanty breakfast and harnessing my horse, he sat on his log, kneading and clawing, flirting his abominable tail, and cursing and swearing at me after his cattish sort, with an expression of face perfectly diabolical. 
               "Upon all these savage demonstrations I meditated a good deal; but at last concluded that they must be charged to the changeable character of the beast. He had first liked me, and then hated me without any particular reason; for I had made no advances towards him, either friendly or hostile. I however considered that I might lightly endure the enmity of a yellow tomcat, even of the largest dimensions, and so dismissed the matter from my mind. 
               "A few weeks afterwards, while I was in Nashville, and had nearly sold out my stock, I received a letter from a firm in Charleston with whom I had transacted some business ness, requesting me to come immediately thither, and make arrangements to undertake an agency further south, in their employment. I made preparations to start next morning, for their terms were liberal, and at that time I cared little what or where was my occupation, if only I could rove enough. A day's notice would have sufficed me for a voyage around the world. 
               "As I lay in bed next morning waiting for the breakfast-bell, the recollection of old Mr. and Mrs. Graves, and their enormous and fickle pussy, came into my mind. The strange behavior of that respectable quadruped had served to impress the occurrences of my last visit deeply on my memory; and by spontaneous mental operation, I now remembered a circumstance which had before escaped me. During my last breakfast at the mountain tavern, tile old lady remarked to her husband, as I finished the fag-end of a lean scrap of bacon, and a crust of corn bread, that she didn't know what on earth they should do for dinner, unless they should kill tom; for there wasn't another mouthful of anything on the place. Now, thought I to myself, what could the miserable old creatures do if they should actually get out of provisions? For they could not possibly travel to any other house, in either direction. They had told me that once or twice already they had been reduced to great straits by the non-arrival of any passengers, at times when their own stores had failed. But there was the garden? Yes; but as it happened, there was also nothing in it; for an unprecedentedly long and late drought had that season destroyed nearly all the summer crops, and even many of the forest trees, in the drier parts of that high, mountainous region. And their Western improvidence would prevent them from actual preparation for an emergency of the kind I was contemplating, since 'they had done well enough so far.' Now, I continued, could that frightful yellow cat have foreseen, by some inscrutable animal intuition, such as dogs and horses have often been supposed to possess, that a famine was impending over the household, and that I was consuming the last portion of food, and leaving only useless, inedible specie in return? And was it that foreboding which made him so savage and persistent in his wrath and his vociferations? 
               "I very soon, however, got rid of these unpromising speculations in the bustle of breakfast and of preparing for my long ride. For there was no public conveyance by my old route, which, as the shortest, I proposed to take; and having disposed of my team, I purchased a saddle-horse, took provisions and a double-barrelled pistol, and set out. 
               "But as I rode along through solitary woods, or on the unfrequented paths among plantations, the odd notions that had perplexed me in the morning unaccountably rose up again in my mind. Suppose the old people should have got entirely out of food? Suppose that rascally old tomcat did really have the 'second sight,' and had been shrieking out like a feline and fuscous Cassandra, a true and unregarded prophecy of woe? What a miserable and unhappy end of their lonely, forgotten lives, to starve in their solitary home on the mountains, alone! To feel their impotence, and wait in helpless, hopeless weakness, for passengers who did not come-to see the shadows shorten on the floor in the morning, and lengthen again in the slanting sunbeams of afternoon, and to hear no approaching step-and then suddenly I remembered wild stories of attacks made by cats upon babes or the helpless sick, or even upon unwatched corpses of the dead. I was active and young; yet these horrid fancies clustered continually about me, despite my endeavors to drive them away, and filled me full of foolish fears to approach the solitary frame house. I argued the whole case over and over; and repeatedly and uselessly convicted myself of nervousness, of folly, of, silly dreaming. But as soon as the procession of the reasoning had passed by, and even before, up jumped again the pallid ghosts of the mountain couple. At last, quite put of patience, I drove my horse to his utmost capacity; hurrying, since I could do no better, to dispel, by close encounter, and familiar experience of the aged faces and tottering forms of the old man and woman, the uncomfortable phantoms that haunted me, and that crowded and plagued me more and more every hour. 
               "After several days' hard travel I approached the old house. I watched the road earnestly for traces of footsteps, or horse or carriage-tracks; but I could see only the half-effacea remains of old ones, washed out by rain, or filled with wind-driven dust. Yet this afforded only a faint presumption; and how absurd did the idea seem that two people, in a habitable house on the public road, should starve in solitude for lack of provisions! 
               "I crossed the summit of a ridge, from which I could look down as from the rim of a basin upon the bottom and sides of the wide valley in the higher region of the Cumberland Mountains, in the middle of which the old home stood. The low rays of the western sun, in the floods of the thick yellow light which is the peculiar illumination of the middle and latter half of the golden afternoon, poured over all the amphitheatre, and seemed even to concentrate in still and flaming glories upon the bare old house, and within the small clearing around it. Utter and doleful silence slept over all the region. The heat was intense; and neither did breeze stir the woodlands, nor did bird or beast move or speak in the forest. I reined up and looked forward with the indistinct yet intense tense volition which we exercise when upon the margin of some undetermined revelation, as if a strong and earnest wish might suffice to show us what we desire to know. Slowly and hesitatingly I set forward again. I met none. I saw none but old tracks. I heard nothing except the reduplicating tramp of my weary horse as I urged him on at a quick walk-his panting, the creaking of his accoutrements. Forward, forward; nearer and nearer to the vortex of these most gratuitous and absurd, but now involuntary and almost unendurable terrors of mine. 
               "I came suddenly out from beneath the shadowy branches of the high forest trees upon the open ground before the house. The hot yellow light struck me almost faint. The doors and windows were closed. Dust and silence possessed all the outer portions of the homestead. The rusty axe lay upon the chips before the door; an old bucket stood upon the steps; a squirrel skittered across the front of the building and ran squeaking into the rickety garden fence; and an inarticulate moaning noise was heard, and something was feebly dropped against the kitchen window from within. Doubtless, that was the voice and hand of one of the ancient inmates, fallen near the window, while looking in vain, with dim and dimming eyes, for help that did not come. 
               "I was just in season, then, to relieve the poor old couple from perishing. In a half expectation of such a case, I had stored my saddle-bags with food. I leaped from my saddle, hastily fastened my horse, snatched the saddle-bags, drew my pistol for fear of any surprise, and hurried to the window. But quicker yet I recoiled. The hideous beast, crouched upon the breast of his dead mistress, cowering there, a gaunt and bony fiend, but with red and angry eyes and bloody jaws, recognized me; sprang with renewed and demoniac strength against the dusty window, through which, in a sort of fear to open the door, I had first peered in upon the secrets of the fearful house. In utter abandonment of frantic anger he flung himself, and flew sideways, with impotent and wide extended fangs and talons, and a shrill and direful cry, against the window, so that the thin glass cracked and shivered, and the hateful thing dashed, but for the transparent film, right in my face. 
               "My momentary glance within showed me that my speculations had been well founded. They were coxistent with some fearful chance, or God had chosen to make me an instrument of death to the two wretched old beings there. For if not, should I not have hastened back to them with food on the day I left them last? 
               "The old man lay dead upon the bed, and his wife upon the floor. *  *  *  *  *   * But such was the debilitating effect of my previous cogitations, and of the recognition and fiendish virulence of the enormous cat, that my courage was utterly shattered. I fired with unsteady hand upon the beast as he lay kicking on the floor; wounded him; fled straightway to my horse, stumbling in sheer blind affright, and strove to unfasten him. 
               "But awful yells from the imprisoned cat paralyzed my fingers. Again and again the frightful thing sprang against the window. The weak panes shattered; the hateful yellow beast caught upon the broken fragments left in the sash; tore himself, and bled; scrambled furiously, through; flew across the narrow yard; and just as I was mounting, as well as my miserable fear would allow me, sprang at me, caught me by the leg and bit and bit with an agonizing and malevolent energy which could only have been inspired by fiends; relaxed his hold, and fell dying to the ground. 
               "In utter and unimaginable rapture of terror, I set spurs to my horse, screamed to him, whipped him frantically; and so fled far away from the ghastly place. 
               "But the creature had bitten me with poisonous teeth. And ever since, he is close behind me, and every little while he yells and screams in my ears until I rave. I won't bear it any longer," screamed my gentlemanly friend, looking quickly behind him, and then bending upon me wild eyes, whose increasingly unsteady glitter I had uneasily marked during all the latter portion of this incoherent story--"There he is again! Don't you see him? He'll bite you, too! Let's jump overboard; he can't get us there!" 
               And before I could do more than cry out once, he gripped me, lifted me from the deck and sprung with me, out and down into the white shadowy horror of boiling foam that hissed and gurgled and wallowed, in the twilight under the great steamer's stern. 
                
               The cold water awakened me. I lay floundering on the state-room floor, amalgamated with a broken basin and pitcher-the water thence proceeding-a chair, my trunks and my boots. And a baby was squalling fearfully in the next state-room, not a foot from the berth where I had been sleeping. The vehement shouts of this innocent had furnished the squalls of the cat, around which, as a nucleus, the other circumstances of my dream had grouped themselves, in the rapid crystallization of spontaneous mental action. 
                
               "Hence, we view" that- 
               1. Lunatics generalize upon insufficient deductions. 
               2. Lunatics should not travel unrestrained in public conveyances. 
               3. Babies should not travel at all in public conveyances, unless they (the babies) are hermetically sealed.
                
             
             
                
               XI. MY HUSBAND'S MOTHER. 
               IT I was the morning after Helen's wedding, and as I stood in the large parlors, now so still and breathless, where only the evening before, merry words and light laughter had rechoed, I began for the first time to realize that Helen had gone. 
               I threw myself on a sofa near the conservatory; the wind, laden with sweet perfume, swept over my cheek as I pulled the cushions into shape, and, assuming an easy position, prepared to indulge in a favorite amusement of mine-day-dreaming. 
               My thoughts reverted to the distant past, and the scenes of my childhood came vividly before me. 
               I seemed to see my own quiet home-my gentle mother bending over her sewing, as she was wont to do from early morn to the late evening, ever cheerful, ever busy, until she sickened and died. 
               That death-bed! How well I remembered it! 
               Her last fond embrace and her fast-falling tears, as she lay on the lowly bed, her thin hand resting on the white counterpane, and the white curtains blowing out gently into the room, fanning her pale cheek. 
               Good Mrs. Evans stood by the bedside weeping bitterly and reiterating her promise to follow the directions of my mother concerning me. I only comprehended that my mother was to leave me, and clung to her hand, looking at her wonderingly. 
                
               How could I know that she was to die? I had seen her sick so many times, and knew so little what death was! 
               I watched her as she breathed fainter and fainter, her eyes all the while fixed on me with a loving expression that I can never forget. 
               "Heavenly Father," she breathed, "to thee I commit my child." Her clasp of my hand tightened, then relaxed, and all was over. Again I thought of the time when I had first entered these rooms, contrasting so strongly with the low walls and simple furniture of my cottage-home, that I was almost dazzled and knew not which to admire most, the lady dressed in silks and laces, to whom I was presented, or the elegance that surrounded her. 
               I was half afraid of my aunt, till she clasped me in her warm embrace, half-smothering me in her enormous sleeves as she pressed me in her arms. 
               I believe she would have wept over me, but unfortunately, as she held me off to look at me, my long hair having got entangled in any number of chains which depended from her neck, my horrified expression was so far removed from anything pathetic, that she burst into a fit of laughter. I, for my part, felt more inclined to cry, as my uncle who stood by came to the rescue; at length, with the aid of scissors, I was separated from my aunt with the loss of a little of my abundant hair, and I doubt not since I have known her better, of a very prettly little speech of welcome also, which she had prepared to deliver. 
               Good Mrs. Evans, who had brought me to Boston, was treated with every possible attention, and on parting with me the next day, as she was to return to her home, assured me that I "was in good hands, for my aunt's folks was the nicest folks that ever was." 
                
               I was soon fairly settled, and my sadness, which I had determined never to get over, feeling as if any cessation of grief denoted a lack of affection for my mother, gradually vanished before the bright smiles and merry chat of my four cousins. The two older ones, having finished their education, had come out, and parties, rides, and other amusements followed each other in quick succession. 
               Maggie, Helen, and I were still school-girls, but yet Aunt McLellan allowed us to join occasionally in rides, and to make our appearance at small social parties, which we enjoyed most heartily. 
               Our house was always thronged with company, and my aunt herself was the life of our parties of pleasure. 
               My uncle, a studious and reserved man, passed most of his time in his study, and so long as he was allowed to remain in undisturbed possession of that room, cared little how his family spent their time, if they were only happy. 
               So years passed on, and no shadow dimmed the sunshine of that happy household, till death entered. 
               My uncle, after a short and severe illness, died. 
               My aunt was inconsolable; in fact, we were all overwhelmed with grief. Death, we knew, must come to all, but we had never dreamed that it would come so soon, so suddenly; and that my uncle, in the pride of manly vigor, must go down to the narrow grave. 
               We felt at first as people always do, that we could never be happy again. We mourned for my uncle sincerely, but yet two years had hardly passed before the old homestead was as gay as ever. 
               The death of my uncle had brought to light the fact that we were no longer wealthy. My aunt's large fortune had melted, no one knew how or where, but it had gone. We were poor. 
               I do not know what my aunt would have done, if stinging ing poverty had come upon us; for she realized nothing of its evils, and the announcement of the fact of her situation did not trouble her in the least; she was spared the painful task of endeavoring to satisfy expensive habits with inadequate means; for an old uncle of hers settled upon her an annuity for her lifetime. 
               Upon this she lived just as ever, gratifying every present wish, with but one thought for the future. 
               The loss of her property seemed to have produced but one result: that of making her anxious to settle her daughters well in marriage, and very soon both Charlotte and Lizzie were disposed of. Both married wealthy men-both made "good matches," as they are called. 
               This was somewhat to our surprise; for Charlotte had nothing but her never-failing good-humor to attract; for she was positively plain; yet her husband was considered one of the "greatest catches" in town. 
               Lizzie was very talented, and had always treated the common herd as quite beneath her notice; yet she married a silly fellow, with nothing but his good looks and his wealth to recommend him; what was stranger than all, she almost adored him-gave him credit for all the brilliant remarks that she made in conversation, and finally cheated herself and some others-her husband among the number-into the belief that he was a man of fine mind, who had never before been appreciated. 
               Maggie, Helen, and I, now being left, soon found that our only chance of resting' quietly depended on being, at at least, engaged. 
               Maggie declared that she had a decided vocation for the life of an old maid, and, absorbed in her own pursuits, scarcely thought of marriage; and when Mr. Carroll, a bachelor of good fortune, presented himself as a suitor, she resolutely persisted in rejecting all his attentions. 
                
               My aunt and he were equally determined that she should marry him; and, after a long and vigorous siege, the fortress surrendered. 
               Maggie became Mrs. Carroll. 
               Helen and I had enjoyed tolerable quiet during this skirmish; but it was now our turn. 
               As Helen was the beauty of the family, my aunt had decided that she was to make the grand match. Indeed, she had admirers by scores. 
               She sang and danced with the gay young gentlemen, played whist and talked politics, or, what is more strictly true, listened to politics, with the elderly ones; was the wildest and merriest in all parties of pleasure, the kindest in sickness, the most benevolent to the poor of all our circle; and, with all these charms, married a poor minister, to Aunt McLellan's infinite disgust. 
               It required a great deal of strategy to win her consent, and not until visions of her daughter, as the wife of the Right Reverend Bishop Wilmot, which I conjured up, as in the future, had, from my glowing representations, assumed in her mind all the vividness of reality, did she yield. 
               It was now the day after the wedding, and Aunt McLellan had acted the part of a loving mother, which she really was, to perfection. 
               She was in her element during the whole progress of a wedding, from the preparatory process of making garments of all sorts, shapes, and sizes, to the last embrace in the presence of admiring friends, as the bride left home for the wedding tour on which our mother always insisted as quite as necessary to the proper union of the parties as the words spoken by the parson. 
               "Here am I, then, left alone," I said, half aloud, concluding my long reverie; and, starting up, I snatched my duster, which had fallen from my hand, and began to wipe some stray particles of dust from the polished rosewood of the piano; then, running my fingers over the keys, I began to sing a simple melody. 
               "Very well done, Sibyl," said my aunt, who had entered the room unperceived, and now stood by my side. "But now come up to my chamber; I want to talk to you." 
               I followed her to her room, and took my usual seat, a low rocking-chair by the window. 
               A few commonplace observations followed, on the wedding, and I watched for the subject on which she wished to speak. At last it came. 
               "Did you see Dr. Carter last night?" 
               "Dr. Carter," I mused. "Really, I saw so many strangers, I can hardly tell; but I dare say I did. I think I do remember a tall dark man who was rather reserved, who was introduced to me as Dr. something, I didn't hear what; you know people always mumble over names at an introduction, as if that was a very unimportant matter. Well, what of him?" 
               "That I am commissioned to offer you his heart and hand." 
               I could only stare in mute surprise. "To me?" at last I gasped. 
               "Yes, my dear; it was a case of love at first sight." I burst into a fit of laughter, for suddenly all our conversation flashed upon me. 
               "My dear Auntie," said I, "you must be joking. The only words that we exchanged were these: he suggested that it was a fine evening, to which I assented. I remarked on the beauty of the bride, to which he assented. I am very sure that this was all of our conversation;" and again I began to laugh. 
               "'Laugh, then, if you will, you silly girl," at last interrupted rupted my aunt, evidently provoked. "It is so, I assure you; and he is a very fine man, of whose admiration you ought to be proud. He is rather eccentric." 
               "So I should think," interrupted I. 
               "What shall I say to him?" asked my aunt. 
               "Whatever you choose, so that he may understand that I mean no," was my reply. 
               "You are certainly the most provoking girl in the world!" exclaimed Aunt McLellan. "To be sure, he is not very rich; but he has a good practice, which is on the increase, and what do you expect?-you, who have neither beauty nor fortune to attract admirers? Now, here is a man, as good a one as I could select for my own daughter, a better husband than Helen's with all her attractions, and yet you obstinately refuse to see him even." 
               "Very well! I will see him," replied I, and subsided into silence. 
               My aunt rose and left the room very wisely, and I very foolishly went to a mirror to see what there was in my appearance to warrant one's falling in love with me at first sight. 
               The greatest vanity would not allow me to think myself handsome, but I did feel myself a little flattered, nevertheless. 
               "I will see this man," I resolved. "He must be rather weak; and since he is so much in love, I can treat him as I please." 
               So I pleased myself with imagining the cool dignity and grace of manner with which I would conduct myself during the interview. 
               It came at last. 
               Dr. Carter was announced. 
               As I entered the parlor, a tall dark man rose to meet me. He took my hand kindly, but with none of the embarrassment or ardor that I had anticipated, and leading me to a seat, began in a calm and quiet manner to tell me what I already knew, that he had been attracted to me, and to explain his reasons for his abrupt declaration of it. His views with regard to so-called engagements were quite different from those of the generality of people, he said. It was his idea that the tie thus formed should not be considered as so binding that withdrawal from it should be regarded as dishonorable to either party. It was the only way, he thought, that two people could arrive at that intimate knowledge of each other's character, which was necessary to insure happiness in a union for life; and when an engagement was formed it should be considered merely that the parties entering into it, having been attracted to each other, did so for the purpose of knowing more of each other. If the result of that knowledge was mutually pleasing, well and good; if not, let either withdraw, without any hard feeling, content to remain friends, if nothing more. 
               Having thus explained his views, he asked me if I were willing to engage myself to him, adding that his duties required his presence at home immediately, and he must ask a speedy decision. 
               While he had been talking, I had been repeating to myself, "Can this man be in love with me?" 
               His cool manner of making love, if so it might be called, was quite different from anything to which I had been accustomed. But I liked him, nevertheless. 
               I felt provoked to think I should seem so easily won, if I consented; and I knew, too, that he was not one to be trifled with, and that I must at once say yes or no. 
               "Yes," I did not want to say; "No," still less. I was conscious that I appeared to far greater disadvantage than he, as I sat looking at the flowers in the carpet at my foot. 
                
               "Have you decided?" asked the Doctor, as I looked up. 
               "Yes," I replied. 
               "And how?" continued he, not eagerly, but as if it were the most commonplace question in the world. 
               "Yes," again I replied; "and I hope that neither of us will have cause to repent my hasty decision." 
               "I hope not," he replied gravely, and said no more. Not a word of the protestations that I had expected-not a word of love. 
               He immediately changed the subject and began talking of, I hardly know what, but in an easy, unembarrassed manner, for nearly an hour. 
               He then took leave of me, saying that he would see me again before he left, which must be on the next day, and that he would write me immediately on his return home. 
               I was very romantic, and this cool way of wooing was not just to my taste; but after Dr. Carter left me, the oddity of the thing struck me more forcibly, and I was rather better pleased. His letters, which were tolerably frequent, were kind and friendly. 
               He said little of his prospects in life, and remembering that my aunt had said "he was not rich," I concluded that he was poor. 
               This idea suited me, and I used to build all sorts of air castles as to how I would work for and with him, in our quiet little home. I became more and more attached to him, and really felt quite anxious to begin a life of toil for his sake. A year passed rapidly away, and at the end of that time I had become Mrs. Dr. Carter. 
               I will pass over all the details of the wedding, as my experience is precisely similar to that of thousands before me. 
               We were neither married in a cave, nor on a mountain-in a picture gallery, nor under Niagara Falls. 
                
               All was commonplace in the extreme. The same responses were uttered by the bride and groom-the same remarks made by admiring friends. 
               Even poor homely I was pronounced "a beautiful bride," and, if I may credit the same authorities, the groom "appeared remarkably well," also. 
               Even my aunt's favorite termination to the wedding festivities, a wedding tour, was wanting, unless the journey of fifty miles by railroad, to my new home, may pass for that, for Dr. Carter could not leave his duties for pleasure. 
               I could hardly realize, as I was whirled along behind the snorting locomotive, that I had become a wife; and when I stole a glance at my husband, who sat by my side reading the Scalpel, I certainly though that he was far from duly appreciating the importance of his newly-acquired position. 
               "Binghamton!" shouted the conductor, popping his head in at the car door, and disappearing as suddenly. 
               My husband rose. "Here we are," said he, as he gathered up my carpet-bag, shawl and veil, and led the way to the dept. 
               Away whizzed the panting steam-engine, and I stood on the platform by the side of the baggage. 
               Presently the Doctor led me to a carriage, and a few moments' ride brought us to my new home. 
               I had pictured to myself a cottage embowered in trees, situated on a sloping hill, as my future home; but no! a stately brick house stared me in the face, and so there was an end to my day-dreams of love in a cottage. 
               I dare say I looked disappointed, for I felt so on entering the parlors, where nothing was wanting that money could procure. 
               "Does it not please you?" asked my husband. 
               "Oh, yes!" I replied, though I told a bit of a story; then, in a lower tone, I added, "that I had always thought physicians were poor." 
               Dr. Carter laughed, and assured me that he had not taken me from a good home without having the means of supplying an equally good one in its place. 
               So there was an end to a second of my day-dreams-that of working for his sake, of sacrificing my tastes that I might minister to his; in short, of becoming a heroine in some way, I hardly knew how. 
               I pleaded fatigue and went to my room. 
               The air of comfort that it wore provoked me, and I shed tears as my future prospects rose before me. 
               I was to settle down as a respectable married woman-nothing more. 
               I, who had imagined that my wedding-day was to usher in a series of unparalleled trials and exertions, through which I was to pass triumphantly, "winning golden opinions from all sorts" of people. 
               There had been no romance in my engagement-there was none in store for me. 
               But these heart-rending reflections were interrupted by steps on the staircase. 
               I hastily washed my eyes, and tried to look cheerful when my husband came in, and really I was astonished to find how soon I regained my composure, and how soon I forgot in his conversation on books and authors, as he showed me his extensive and well-arranged library, the disagreeable fact that he was rich. 
               He had just taken down a copy of Young's Night Thoughts, which I hastily threw aside, declaring "that I hated Young-that there wasn't a word of poetry in his whole book, and that I would give more for three of Byron's poorest lines than for four hundred volumes of such terrible, gloomy, prosaic thoughts put into the blankest est of blank verse," to all of which he was listening with a smile, when the rustle of a silk dress startled us both. 
               My husband sprang from my side and presented me to the stately lady, his mother. 
               He had often spoken of his mother, and I had imagined that she would meet me at the door, clasp me in her warm embrace, calling me her child, and praying for my happiness. 
               I had often pictured to myself a very pretty tableau of this kind, but as I saw nothing of her on my arrival, I had concluded that she was absent. 
               She had, I judged from her appearance, spent the time which had elapsed in making her toilet, and I should as soon have ventured to embrace Pompey's pillar as to clasp that stately dame in my arms. 
               In fact she seemed as far from expecting any such demonstration. I took her offered hand and replied, to her comments on the weather in as polite and frigid a tone as she herself used. I knew at once that whatever her son might have done, she was far from falling in love with me at first sight, and I was equally sure that my feelings towards her would not come under the head of unrequited affection.
                
               Tea was soon announced, and as if I were a guest, she led the way to the tea-table, gave me a seat by the side of my husband, and took her place at the head of the table. 
               My cheeks flushed a little at this summary mode of disposing of me and my new dignity. 
               I never was ambitious of the duties of presiding officer at any post, particularly of the onerous ones devolving on the occupant of the post of honor at table, and would most willingly have resigned in favor of Madam Carter, had I been allowed the privilege, but I had not even the empty distinction of an abdication, even if it were a forced one offered me. I said nothing, however. 
                
               But, underneath all my mother-in-law's scrupulous politeness towards me, I discovered the fact that she was jealous of me, and determined to yield nothing to me. 
               "If this is a declaration of war, I am ready," thought I, as I took very quietly my cup of tea. 
               As weeks passed, I found that her tactics consisted principally in assuming a patronizing manner towards me. 
               She very kindly assumed the task of entertaining the ladies who called on me, and, on their departure, informed me to whom I should pay the greatest attention. 
               One lady in particular she had warned me against; and, though not very favorably impressed by Mrs. Bryan on her first visit, as I saw it annoyed Madam Carter, I called on her quite soon. 
               She returned my visit speedily. I soon found that she sung well, and very readily complied with her request that we should learn duets together. So that we soon struck up quite an intimacy. 
               My husband's time was very much occupied, and he gave himself no concern whatever about my acquaintances. This did not please me. In fact, I should have infinitely preferred the most rigid surveillance to the cool indifference which he displayed. 
               I began to imagine that he did not love me, and determined to prove him. 
               I had imagined that where love existed there must be perfect sympathy between husband and wife in all their varying moods; but when I was moody, he took no notice of it; when I was gay, he smiled, indeed, but that was all; in fact, he was always the same, calm, cheerful and practical, and I therefore drew the very logical conclusion from my premises that he did not love me. 
               "Will nothing rouse him?" I asked myself; and my evil genius replied, "If you could only make him jealous!" and I resolved to try the experiment. 
               Opportunity was not long wanting. 
               Mr. Canning, a brother of Mrs. Bryan, came to pay his sister a visit. She introduced him at once to me, and I found him both handsome, talented, and agreeable; he appeared to find me equally interesting, and began to show me considerable attention. 
               I enlarged on his attractions, both of mind and person, to my husband-he only yawned in reply; but my mother-in-law looked on his frequent visits with far different eyes. 
               Mr. Canning was not slow to perceive Madam Carter's dislike to him, or my dislike to her; and, though never ungentlemanly, it was evident that he would not pay her that marked deference which she demanded of her acquaintances. 
               She had not as yet expressed her disapprobation of Mr. Canning, as, in fact, she could bring nothing positive against him. 
               One night, however, when we had been at a party where Mr. Canning had been as close an attendant as my shadow, my husband informed me that he wished me to be less intimate both with Mrs. Bryan and her brother. 
               I replied "that I found them both agreeable, and saw no reason for pursuing the course that he recommended." 
               "They are extremely disagreeable to my mother," said my husband. 
               "They are extremely agreeable to your wife," retorted I. 
               "My mother declares that she will not go into the room when they visit here," said he. 
               "A very sensible resolution on your mother's part," was my reply. "She has heretofore been particularly careful to be present on such occasions." 
               "Do you mean to say, then, that you persist in retaining these people as intimate friends when it is so contrary to the wishes of your family?" 
               "Say, rather, to the wishes of your mother, and I reply yes. I recognize no right that she has to dictate from mere caprice, who shall be my associates." 
               "But it is no mere whim, Sibyl. Mrs. Bryan has always been accused of improprieties of conduct, to say the least, and her brother is said to be really unprincipled." 
               "Nonsense!" retorted I; "some sewing-circle gossip of a few tattling old ladies. I shall not give up my friends for such baseless rumors." 
               "I understand you to say, then, decidedly, that you intend to pursue your own course-to cling to these people." 
               "Place your request to give them up on its true ground, jealousy, and I might answer differently." 
               "Jealousy!" repeated my husband in a most contemptuous tone. "So you have imagined me jealous. It is no high compliment, when the cause of it, too, is supposed to be a brainless puppy, like Canning. No, Sibyl, you have much mistaken me. It is my regard for my wife that leads me to warn her against two unprincipled persons." 
               "Say in compliance with your mother's will," I replied, "and you will tell the truth." 
               "As you will," he answered coldly; "but I tell you I will be obeyed. If you cannot comply with a request, obey a command. Drop these people at once and for ever." 
               "Is your mother to be mistress here, or am I?" I exclaimed in a fit of ungovernable passion. "She has domineered over me till I can bear it no longer. We hate each other. We cannot breathe under the same roof; either she or I must go from it." 
               "And can you ask me, Sibyl, to turn my mother from my house-she who toiled early and late to give me the education which has placed me where I now am-that noble mother, who, by her needle, gained subsistence for herself and children, and shall I now be the base wretch to repay her with ingratitude? Never! never!" 
               "Whatever she may have done for you," I rejoined, "she has never, thank Heaven! done aught for me that I must repay with servility. She must be of a generous soul, indeed, to require the subjection of a slave, not only from her son, but from her son's wife. Bow before her, if you will; I will never do it." 
               My husband made no reply. He probably thought that, after a short struggle, I should yield; but no! I was resolved. 
               The next day I went to ride with Mr. Canning, as I had before agreed to do; I was in no mood to play the agreeable, and he, to my surprise, construed my silence and dejection into a regard for him. 
               I speedily checked his insulting expressions of tenderness, and bade him carry me home. 
               I now saw the wisdom of my husband's counsel, but I would not allow my mother-in-law to suppose that her will had been obeyed. 
               As soon as I reached home I commenced packing my trunk; and, having ordered a carriage, I wrote a note for my husband; it ran thus: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "It is an old saying of that old-fashioned book, the Bible, that 'a man shall leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife.' You have decided differently. It is to be presumed that you are right. However that may be, we must part. That you may be happy is the wish of 
                           
                              "SIBYL CARTER."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               This I folded and laid upon the table, where it would meet his eye on his return from a professional visit. 
                
               I had just finished my last duties, and was expecting the carriage every moment, when the door opened and my husband entered. 
               He looked at me, habited as I was for my journey, with no little surprise, but said nothing. 
               His eye fell on the note; he opened it, read it deliberately, and laid it down again. 
               "Is this indeed your final resolution?" he asked. 
               "It is," was my reply. 
               He was silent for a few moments, and I would have given worlds to have known his feelings, but his countenance was impenetrable. 
               At last he spoke. 
               "Any settlement that you may propose, through your lawyer, shall receive immediate attention," he said. 
               I bowed coldly. 
               This, then, was the thought that occupied him. He could think of money matters when I was suffering agonies at parting from him. 
               I would have died rather than receive one penny from him. 
               Just then the carriage came to the door. 
               The driver took my trunk, and I followed him; my husband was behind me, though I did not know it. 
               He lifted me kindly into the carriage, and said a few friendly good-by words. 
               The driver cracked his whip, and we were parted for ever. 
               I sank back in the coach, and wept bitterly. 
               I knew that my husband supposed me to be going to my aunt's, but I had no such idea. 
               I would go somewhere, I cared not where, so nobody knew me, and there I would earn my living. 
               In the cars I matured my plans. I would go to Boston-from thence, to some place as music teacher. 
                
               I went to the Revere House, where I made the acquaintance of a Southern lady, a teacher in a seminary at the South, and, under an assumed name, engaged to accompany her as a teacher. 
               I went with her, and never was there a sadder heart than mine during the nine months that I spent there. 
               I had ample leisure to view my conduct in its true light, and I saw much to condemn. But what should I do? Must I live on so for ever? I asked myself. I cannot; my whole soul would cry out; but I made no definite plans. 
               Taking up a newspaper, one day, I saw a paragraph which spoke of the severe illness of Dr. Carter. 
               "He may die," I gasped, "and never forgive me." 
               The thought was agony. All false pride was forgotten. 
               I started immediately for home, travelling day and night, pursued by the harrowing thought that he might die before I reached him. 
               I inquired, as if I were a common acquaintance, at Binghamton, if he were living. 
               Thank God! he was. 
               It was night, but I hurried up to that well-known house, on foot and alone. 
               I ran through the streets. I entered the house, and walked softly up to his chamber. 
               There he lay, sleeping; his mother by his bedside, where his wife should have been. 
               Her head was bent forward, and she did not see me as I glided to his side. 
               He tossed uneasily. "Sibyl!" he murmured in his sleep. 
               "I am here," I whispered in his ear, for I could bear it no longer. 
               He opened his eyes, fixed them on me with a look of love, sprang forward, and fell back fainting. 
                
               "Woman! you have killed him!" shrieked his mother. 
               But it was not so. The shock had indeed been a great one, but he soon regained his consciousness. 
               There was no need of words then; all was forgotten. He could not bear to have me leave his side, and I was happy nowhere else. 
               I had become very humble, for I bowed myself to my mother-in-law. Was she not his mother? 
               My husband slowly recovered, and when I would have spoken of the past, and begged his forgiveness, he replied- 
               "Forgive me, too, Sibyl, for my severity. We have both suffered much, but we have loved much; and we have learned a great lesson-that of mutual forbearance."

                     -Fullers Holy and Profane State. 
                   
                
                
                  
                      
                        "Old woman, old woman, whither so high?" 
                        "To sweep the cobwebs from the sky." 
                     
                   
                
               MANY years ago, on the old stage-road leading from Boston to Plymouth, just out of Wevmouth into Hingham, there lived an old woman who went by the name of Sue Ward. 
               Where she came from no one knew. Some years before the time of which we write, she had taken up her abode in an old house which had been deserted by its former owner, and there she dwelt-all alone, a perfect mystery to the gossips of the neighborhood. She managed to get a living by doing all sorts of odd jobs for the people of the village; by knitting now and then a pair of stockings; by spinning a few knots of yarn, or going out as nurse for the sick. The villagers also, at first, were quite kind to her. But after a while they began to weary of being benevolent to so mysterious a being. All plotting and questioning to ascertain her former life failed to produce any effect, save a stubborn refusal to gratify curiosity riosity, and slight flashes of anger, which all inquirers agreed boded no good. 
               Although the time of which we write was after the excitement concerning the Salem witches, yet belief in such beings had not wholly died away, especially among the older portion of the community. Could they not quote the Bible and the godly Mr. Mather in support of their doctrine? 
               By-and-by strange stories began to be circulated concerning old Sue Ward. It was said, that being vexed by Deacon Burr, she gave utterance to a muttered curse, and the next morning the deacon's best heifer was found dead, in such a strange position, that nobody but the devil could have brought her there. Then, as Mistress Ward was walking home one cold night, Uncle Joshua overtook her in his nice new wagon. She asked him to carry her home, as she was tired. But he replied he could not, as it was rather off his road, and he was in a hurry. "May you be longer reaching home than I am," exclaimed she, and but a moment afterwards his horse fell, broke both shafts to the wagon, and what was worse, his own leg. 
               These stories, somewhat magnified, perhaps, in the telling, were soon in the mouth of every one in the village. Soon they spoke of her no longer as Mistress Ward, or old Sue Ward. She possessed the three great requisites for a witch of that time: 
               I. She was old. 
               II. She was ugly. 
               III. She was poor. 
               With such an evil suspicion hanging about her, it is no wonder that many who had formerly befriended, now avoided her. Even the little children, having heard the mysterious talk of their parents, as they passed her in the streets, clasped one another's hands more tightly, and, gazing at her with half-frightened looks, went hurriedly on, though some of the larger boys would sometimes shout after her. 
               Matters were thus, as one wild windy November night, old Sue sat by her fire in her lonely hut. She had been out to gather the fagots of which the fire was built, and meeting some rude boys on her return, they had taunted her with unseemly words. Not often would such words have affected her so much. But as the screaming wind howled through the branches of the forest, and she heard the moanings of the dying autumn, thinking all the while that she knew not where to look for help through the coming winter, what wonder that she felt like cursing the day in which she was born? 
               She did curse it most bitterly. Her wicked, withered old heart was lifting itself up in blasphemy, as she sat by her fire that night, and gazed intently into its flames as they lighted up her miserable room. 
               "Why can't I die?" muttered she to herself. "As if seventy years of sorrow, seventy years of sin, wasn't enough for one mortal! Doesn't the Bible say that threescore years and ten are the limits of life? Why should I live longer? I, without friends, with none of the comforts which belong to age-old, poor, miserable, half-starved, and cold?" and she drew up closer to the fire, and continued: 
               "I would drown myself, but the water is so cold. I have not strength enough to kill myself any other way. Why is there no other way but dying to be rid of the world? If folks could cast off life as they do an old garment! I've heard of old worsen that dried up and blew away. The Lord knows I'm dry enough. Why, if He will not let me die, will He not blow me away? I should not care if it was to a warmer place than this, where old women don't have to go out after fagots." And she grinned a most wicked grin, showing one worn yellow stump of a tooth. 
               "Good-evening, Mother Ward," said a voice at her elbow. 
               She turned, and saw just at her side a little old man dressed in black. A quick active old fellow he seemed, as, without being asked, he drew the other of the two rush-bottomed chairs-all the seats the room contained-up to the fire. 
               "Who are you? What do you want?" asked old Sue, as soon as she had a little recovered from her astonishment at this sudden interruption. 
               "A poor cold traveller who wishes to warm himself at your fire," replied he, just glancing at her with his keen black eye. Oh, it was the wickedest eye you ever saw, so full of malice and deviltry, so glittering, and snake-like. 
               "You are welcome to the little warmth a wretched old woman's fire can give. But you have not told me your name, though I ought to know it, as you seem to know mine." 
               "I go under different names," replied he; "those most familiar with me, call me by a nickname, but my proper title is Beel Z. Bubb. But why do you call yourself wretched?" 
               "Have you not lived long enough in the world to know?" replied she, almost fiercely. "There are gray hairs on your brow, and the wrinkles on your face will number almost as many as mine. Is it not always wretched to be old? But perhaps you have warm friends who cheer you with their presence, and sustain you by their love?" 
               She paused a moment, as if waiting for a reply. But the old man sat with his elbows resting on his knees, looking stedfastly into the fire with his cunning eyes. The old woman continued- 
                
               "Perhaps you do not know what it is to outlive all the friends of your youth, to wander away among strangers, and to be shunned and despised by them, to be treated and hooted at as a witch, as one who has dealings with the devil, when I know no more of the devil than you do." 
               "Not perhaps as much," said he, in an undertone. She went on not hearing or not heeding him. 
               "You may not have felt all the wickedness of your soul rise up against your persecutors, prompting you to curse them as I have cursed them time and again, and curse them now. Oh, the good Christian souls! who pretend to be so pious and holy, who roll up their eyes at the very sight of me! I should not wonder if some of them had more dealings with Satan than myself." 
               "No doubt of it," rejoined the old man. 
               Old Sue went on, feeling a strange, thrilling pleasure in telling her wicked thoughts to the one at her side, whose eyes gleamed brighter, and looked more evil, the more wicked she grew. 
               "And I was thinking what a mockery it would be for me to say the Lord's Prayer. 'Our Father'--" 
               The old man gave an uneasy start as she said these words, yet remained quiet, as she repeated no more; but, smiting her skinny hands together, exclaimed- 
               "Why should I call Him my Father? Has He treated me as a child? Has He not left me here in my old age, to rags, and poverty, and abuse, when He might have taken me to His blessed home beyond the skies long before this? Death would long ago have been welcome to me." 
               "Why do you not kill yourself, then?" asked the old man, softly. 
               "I was thinking of that just as you came in. But it is an ugly, horrible business to take one's own life. If there were only some easier way to rid one's self of the world! Did you ever hear," continued she, speaking in a low confidential tone; "did ever you hear of any old women that dried up and blew away?" 
               The Cunning-eyed One for a while spoke not a word. He sat there still and quiet, looking fixedly into the fire. But all at once he burst out with a wild stave of a song. The words so wrought upon the imagination of Mother Ward, that-she knew not why-she began to stamp her feet in accompaniment, and when he came to the chorus, she joined her shrill treble to his cracked bass, and the strange melody rang out clear and piercingly: 
                      
                        "I walked me out the other night, 
                        The wind was blowing high; 
                        I clasped my cloak about me tight, 
                        And wished that I might die. 
                     
                      
                        
                           Chorus.-Oh, for those rare good times of old, 
                        When women, I've heard say, 
                        If winds were high, or weather cold, 
                        Dried up and blew away. 
                     
                      
                        Quoth I, 'O wind! O bitter wind! 
                        Why blow so chill on me? 
                        I'm old and lonely, nearly blind- 
                        What are my rags to thee?' 
                        Oh, for those rare good times of old, etc. 
                     
                      
                        Yet still the cold, cold wind blew on, 
                        And pierced me through and through, 
                        It said to me. in quiet scorn, 
                        'Away with hags like you!' 
                        Oh, for those rare good times of old, etc. 
                     
                      
                        I curse thee, wind, with all my might,- 
                        I curse thy chilling breath,- 
                        Unless thou blow me off to-night, 
                        I'll curse thee till my death. 
                        Oh, for those rare good times of old, etc. 
                     
                  
                
               "Chorus again!" shouted the old man, stamping his foot. And they sang it through again, till the old walls of the room echoed with the wild scream of their voices. 
               "Those good old times may come again," said the old man, after they had finished the singing. "But there is a certain state of feeling to which every one must arrive, before they can vanish from earth. People in the old times oftener reached it than at present." 
               "What is that state? I will attain unto it," said Mother Ward. 
               "I think you will; perhaps you have. Know, then, good mother, that all things here on the earth are vanity. What is lighter than vanity? Doth not the slightest breath stir the leaf of the willow? But vanity is lighter than even the willow's leaf. I said all things were vanity; all things but love are so. It is that which binds men to earth. Were it not for the love which human beings bear to one another-puff-and away they would go, mine for ever. Now, Mother Ward, tell me, have you rid yourself altogether of love? I find many who declare they have done thus, and when I wonder they do not blow away, lo! down deep in their heart, covered over it may be with the glitter of Mammon, with the dross of selfishness, one little particle of love, which keeps them from being altogether vanity. But I am preaching! Tell me, I say, have you rid yourself altogether of love?" 
               Old Sue sat still and thought. Her mind went back through the path of weary years, to the days when a happy child she had clung with affection to those who cherished her under their roof, who called her their darling; she traced her own life as she grew up a wayward beauty; her love poured out in its wealth and tenderness upon one her parents deemed unworthy; her rebellion and forsaking of all for love of him who was to be father and mother to her; her few short months of happiness, and a terrible awakening as the earth received to its bosom her love, her only joy, save an infant life which only kept her grief from laying herself by his side in the grave. 
               Old Sue buried her face in her hands, and wept as the memory of these times came so vividly upon her. The Evil-eyed looked gloomily. 
               But memory would not stop here-as his death and as her treasure's birth. It told over her wrongs. The consciousness of finding herself without money, and consequently without friends, in a great city; the long days of travel, with the precious little one in her arms, to the home of her childhood; the winter's night that heard her timorous knock at the door, and- 
               The one at her side looked smilingly. The tears had dried, and foulest hate scowled forth from her face. 
               And the same wild night heard a father's curse upon his offspring; it saw a woman faint and foot-worn go forth; with its winds and storms it hushed a child's cry for ever, and wrought long months of disease upon the mother. From that bed of sickness, Memory told her how she rose with vows of vengeance, but it did not dare to dwell upon the unnatural crimes which followed; of vain endeavors to escape remorse, of her flight over the sea, of the years she had wished to die. 
               She rose from her seat-trembling and pale-for she had dared to think upon her sinful past. She had a parent's love, and it had cursed instead of blessed her; she won a dearer love, and it died from her; a child's love had blossomed in her heart, but it was rudely killed and its death terribly avenged. She had no other love-all was unfriendliness and hate. 
               "Are you ready to go?" said the old man calmly. He knew that she was his. 
                
               "Let me first warm myself before my journey," replied she. Then she gathered all the fagots into the middle of the room, and kindled them. The room blazed in a moment, as the flames leaped fierce and hot. 
               "I am ready," said she. 
               That night good John Benton came riding from Plymouth. As he approached old Sue's hut he saw the fire burst forth from its windows, and strangest of all, two shadowy forms glided far away above the burning flames, flying into the darkness of the night, while a gust of wind mightier than ever he had before felt, almost blew him from his horse. 
               These things he averred to the crowd who collected around the burning dwelling. And what confirmed the narration was, that no bones could be found among the ruins-neither was old Sue Ward seen any more. 
               This is a story believed by many persons to the present day, and on account of which, every old house thereabouts has a horseshoe nailed to its door, and this maxim prevails: 
                     CHERISH LOVE LEST YOU BECOME VANITY.
                  
                
             
             
                
               XIII. THE AMBASSADOR IN SPITE OF HIMSELF. 
               OUR country bids fair to be known as the Limbo of lost notables. Dethroned monarchs and jail-breakers, usurpers and pickpockets, conspirators against dynasties, and fugitives with their friends' wives, outlawed patriots and fraudulent bankrupts, disappear from Europe to find their way here by the over-sea railroad; and the most famous among them sink, after a few days of newspaper notoriety and gossip, to the same forgetfulness as the meanest. The home-keeping American, if he patiently bide his time, may hope to see the actors on the foreign stage, political as well as dramatic, with greater probability than Barnum would promise a succession of shows. The Connecticut Yankee will point you out the cave where the regicide Puritan hid himself from the avenger of blood; the New-Yorker, as the locomotive of the Hudson River Railroad is gaining its topmost speed, after leaving the dept at Thirty-first street, sees on a low rocky point the tan vats, where (some say) Talleyrand curried hides, as more recently Garibald made candles in Staten Island; on the curving shore of the Delaware lies the princely domain which a Bonaparte enriched with the spoils of Spain, and a few miles above, on the opposite bank, stand the stables of the country house from which Moreau went back to die on the field in arms against his master and France. Many of us remember ber Louis Philippe as a "schoolmaster abroad" among us, rejected by a Philadelphia lady, and looking as like as two pears to Dr. Hare; Louis Napoleon, his now Imperial supplanter, whose boots the representatives of the oldest names of France are eager to lick, was voted by the few who knew him, a worthless, dirty, debauched vagabond; one Murat put up his shingle as an attorney-at-law in Florida, while his fat brother fought cocks among blackguards at Bordentown. The Hungarian demagogue, half-orator, half-prophet, whose oriental eloquence shook the continent like an earthquake, after showing, like his types of Greece and Rome, a little white feather, strolls and stars it among our staring democrats for a dollar a head and expenses; nor may the time be far distant, when Pio Nono, again abandoning the City of Martyrs, will sing: 
                     "I've been Rome-ing, I've been roaming,"
                   within the classic cloisters of Fordham; and now reigning sovereigns and haughty aristocrats find a safe hedge in our banks and state-funds, should the cards be dealt against them at home. Odd, isn't it? that the "insecure and ephemeral republic, which has in its bosom the elements of its own destruction," should be used as the ultimate asylum of life and fortune, when the arsenals and treasure-houses, gray with the moss of centuries, crumble before revolutionary fires! and that those who can stir so furiously the cauldrons of popular passion, despite of the police and bayonets of strong governments, fail to make on this side of the Atlantic any more fuss than a nine days' wonder! 
                      
                        "Nothing that is rich and strange, 
                        But doth suffer a sea-change." 
                     
                   Foreigners laugh at our love of a furor; but we hardworking people must have our fun, and we crowd it hard into our few leisure hours, making it out of what we please. Wellington himself, had he come here, could not have been fted more than Dickens, who, with all his genius, proved himself a snob; and Victoria might fall behind Jenny Lind. Thackeray is lionized as much as Morpeth, and Mr. G. P. R. (are there any more initials?) James, the Man voluminous, out-tales among us the most Bashaw magnificent of them all. We even meet them on their own ground. Jim Crow and his wife oust Punch and Judy from the puppet-show-box, where their "flag has waved a thousand years;" while Uncle Tom and Topsey carry off the admiration of a Parisian carnival, from "the nephew of my uncle" and his imperial Eugenie. Nay, should the privileged blood run out over there, it will go hard but we can supply them. A few years since (according to certain genealogists), a legitimate Stuart domiciled on Long Island; a legitimate Bonaparte lives a citizen of Maryland; a legitimate Bourbon (tu ipso teste, O Putnam!) turns up in a swarthy, self-denying, humble missionary among the Mohawks; you can see by the armorial bearings on the long line of carriages in front of Grace church every fine Sunday, that an heir to every coronet in Britain may be found by searching the codfish warehouses of New York; or should his ex-democratic majesty, during his visit to Europe, find a queen or heiress-apparent anxious for progeny, he may negotiate a marriage on behalf of Prince John, than whom she cannot find a more vigorous or better husband among her royal cousins. We cannot spare him, however, until he has smashed the aldermen, after which he will be up to any amount of emancipation and reform. 
               -But I beg pardon. I sat down to write a story, and have been wandering in a fit of patriotic ardor. I meant to say, in the beginning, that many a man, who might have been notable elsewhere from facts in his career, is allowed here to remain in obscurity, of which I was going to give an example. 
               The English, stimulated by their zeal for illuminating the heathen and removing oppression, are now pushing a disinterested crusade over the Burman empire; but is it known to you, patient reader of Putnam, that so far back as the first French Republic, an ambassador from that great nation, and he an American, was received with high honors at the Court of Ava? Nevertheless, so it was; and that is the story I have to tell-a true story-not a romance, but a veracious narrative of what actually occurred. I give it as I had it from the lips of a friend, who heard the hero of the adventure relate it himself. 
               -There lived in a neighboring city a most worthy man, who by a long and honorable prosecution of an extensive trade, had won both large fortune and high reputation. Sometimes, by artful persuasion, he could be induced to give, though reluctantly, an account of a singular passage in his early life. The recital would set the table in a roar, which was no way checked by the grave vexation which he showed over his remembered troubles. Others might laugh at them, but they had no fun for him. 
               -When I was quite young, he would say, I was placed with the well-known firm of -- & Co., and at the age of eighteen had gained their confidence so far, as often to be intrusted with important business, which fired my ambition to the highest pitch. About that time the firm resolved to send one of their best ships with a large cargo of piece goods on a long trading voyage to the East, and to my extreme gratification, I was appointed supercargo to act in concert with the captain in the management of the venture. The captain was a most kind and intelligent man, whose society was of great use to me. Our voyage out was speedy, and our operations for some time very successful. I often congratulated myself on my share of the profits, but more on the credit I should have with my principals for discharging so well the duties they had assigned me. This was my constant theme when conversing with the captain, scarcely less delighted than myself. Not all the strange wonders of the eastern world, the magnificent scenery along the shores of continent and island, the voluptuous fragrance of "the spicy breezes," or the clear grandeur of the sparkling heavens, could seduce me from considering, night and day, how I should sell the piece goods, and buy a return cargo to the best advantage. Every evening the invoices, with my well-worn letter of instructions, were spread out on my cabin table, and I went to my berth to dream of balance-sheets and future copartnerships. 
               -But a sad disaster came over our hopes. One of those frequent storms which are experienced only in those latitudes, suddenly fell upon us. For many hours we drifted on in utter darkness, except when the lightning kindled the foaming waves to flames. Everything that human skill and daring could do was done by our noble captain and his hardy crew; but the elements were too much for us. Spar after spar was shivered, the tiller-ropes parted and the rudder unshipped. When thus crippled and at the mercy of winds and waves, a terrible cry came aft of "Breakers ahead!" and before a word could be spoken, the ship was lifted high on a rolling sea, and flung bodily on an outlying reef. The shock threw some overboard, and for a few moments stupefied the rest. Death stared us fiercely in the face. I was little more than a boy, and life was dear to me. I thought of home and those I loved. I tried to think of eternity; but amidst all I could not help thinking of the piece goods-what would become of them when the vessel broke up? would they sink among the astonished fishes, or be strewed along the shores to be picked up by the natives? What would our House at home think of us? Would they ever find out how well we had managed, and how much we had made for them before the wreck? All these and a thousand more such thoughts passed through my mind with incredible quickness; and notwithstanding most vigorous efforts to turn it on religious things, the piece goods would struggle to be uppermost. I have heard that Napoleon's last words were, "Tte d'arme!" mine, had I perished then, would have been, "Piece goods!" 
               But we were saved. When at our utmost extremity, there came a calm as sudden as the storm. The breakers were still dashing over us, but as the morning sun broke through the clouds, they subsided rapidly, and we were able to judge of our situation. The ship was clearly lost to us, though her hull, perched upon rocks bare at low water, was as yet but little broken, and I saw that the piece goods were for the most part undamaged. Some boats from the coast came off to us, and we managed to learn that we were a few leagues from the town of Rangoon, at the principal mouth of the river Irrawaddy. 
               To our still greater satisfaction, two English trading brigs, on hearing of a vessel being cast away, ran down to us, and as they were nearly empty, we were able to transfer a large, and the best part of the cargo (which, being piece goods, could be more easily handled), from our stranded vessel into theirs. More intent upon saving the piece goods, we had taken nothing from the cabin but the ship's papers and the captain's instruments, before a change in the tide filled it with water, leaving us only the clothes we stood in. The chief men of the town permitted us to land and store our piece goods, and we intended, if possible, to purchase some vessel in which to prosecute our voyage. The captains of the English brigs, and some other English who happened to be there, treated us with great kindness, but none more so than a Colonel Symes, who sent us all the clothing we stood in need of from his own wardrobe, besides many other attentions. This Colonel Symes was an eminently sensible gentleman, who had been sent there by the British East India Company to negotiate preliminaries for a commercial treaty with the king of the country; but he told us that although he had been several weeks waiting for it, he had not yet received permission to go up the river to Ava, were the court was held. Although treated in every other respect with great distinction, and hospitable provision for his comforts, he was quite chafed by the delay; yet the importance of his mission compelled him to endure as a diplomat what he fretted at as a soldier. He was fond of talking his troubles over with me, mainly, I suppose, because the modesty of my youth made me a deferential listener. You will judge from this how much we owed to our English friends, and how loath we would have been willingly to be of any hindrance to them, Colonel Symes particularly. 
               Things went on in this way for several weeks, the captain and myself lodging together, and listlessly waiting for some vessel to come in, which we might purchase or charter; when one morning, as we were over our breakfast, we heard a great noise of music, or what the people there mean for music-blowing of horns, beating of tomtoms and gongs, and other horrid things. It came nearer and nearer, and halted before the door of our humble house. On going to the window we saw, to our astonishment, the street for a considerable distance crowded with military, horse and foot. A superbly dressed officer, whom they seemed to be escorting, dismounted amidst another grand flourish of the music, and, leaving his richly caparisoned horse in the care of a servant, bowed his head under the low portal, and entered the house. That he came to visit us we had not the slightest idea, until he flung open the door and salaamed us to the ground. Even so respectful a gesture failed to allay the alarm the captain and I felt for our lives, and the piece goods, which were stowed in the rear of the dwelling; but, while we were alternately exchanging looks with each other and staring at our remarkable visitor, a meek-looking native stole to his side and made signs that he would act as interpreter, which he afterwards did in very broken English. 
               "My lord," said he, "who is a very great man and brave general, has been sent by the most mighty king, at whose power we tremble, and in whose smile we live, to assure your Excellencies of the great satisfaction he has had in hearing of your safe arrival in his dominions." 
               The captain answered, "Tell the gentleman that we cannot understand why he or the king should be so civil to us, as my friend here is nothing more than a supercargo, and I only captain of a ship, with a cargo of piece goods. Our vessel was wrecked a little way from here, and we are only waiting to get another, and be off, without troubling the king or anybody else." 
               The interpreter appeared to translate it; the officer spoke to him again, and he said to us: 
               "My lord, in the name of his Majesty our most mighty king, desires to say that he has heard of the vast and glorious republic of France, and prays that its prosperity may be increased for ever; he also hopes that the serene and magnificent King of the Republic of France is in perfect health, and victorious over all his enemies." 
               "The Republic of France! The King of the Republic of France! What do you mean, Mr. Interpreter? We know nothing about France; neither of us were ever there in our lives. We're Yankees, not Frenchmen, thank God! However, you must be a little green, Mister, to talk about kings of a republic. Our country is a republic, free and independent, and we have none of your kings there, I guess. But tell the gentleman he is mistaken in thinking we are Frenchmen; though if he or his Majesty want to buy any piece goods, we are ready for a dicker." 
               The Captain had taken a fresh quid, shut his jack-knife with a valorous slap, and was as much of a live Yankee as five-feet-eight in height and four feet round the chest could make him. 
               After another interchange of their gibberish, the little man said again: 
               "My lord begs that he may be informed which of you most excellent gentlemen is his great Excellency the Ambassador of the vast and glorious Republic of France, that he may give him especially the salutation of his sublime Majesty, our most mighty king." 
               "Tell him, I tell you, you blundering lubber, that we ain't neither of us Frenchmen, nor ambassadors, either. We don't represent nothing but our owners, and a cargo of piece goods. Why don't you tell the gentleman so, and be done with your humbugging!" 
               "My lord begs to say to your Excellencies, that he cannot be mistaken; one of you must be the ambassador of the vast and glorious Republic of France, and he entreats your amiable Excellencies to tell him which of you it is." 
               "I tell you again, neither of us. We can't speak a word of parleyvoo, and don't want to. We're a couple of Yankees from the States." 
               "My lord says, your honorable Excellencies, that he has had his orders from our mighty king to come here and find his eminence the ambassador from the vast and glorious Republic of France, and escort him up the river to Ava, that he may communicate with his ever-to-be-worshipped majesty the wishes of his government. A thousand troops are waiting to guard him to the river, where the boats are ready. My lord does not care which of you is the ambassador; that you may settle between yourselves; but one of you must go with him as the high and noble-born ambassador of the vast and glorious Republic of France." 
               Finding the thing becoming serious and our military visitor determined to execute his orders, right or wrong, we proposed to send for Colonel Symes, that he might explain the mistake; but this the General would not hear of, declaring that one of us must set off with him at once. Further resistance was impossible, and the Captain and I consulted which should go. Whether the one who went would ever return, or if he did, how long he would be kept, we could not tell. I could sell the piece goods, but could not sail a ship if one were got; the Captain could do both without me; so we decided that, as it would not be right to abandon the piece goods, I should give myself up to our captor, for he acted like one. I then told him again that it was all a mistake, as he would find out when we reached Ava; but if he insisted upon taking one of us, I was his man. Whereupon he salaamed me to the ground, and begged to set out with me at once. The Captain and I had a brief conference about the piece goods, which I reluctantly gave over to his single control. I shook his hands with tears in my eyes, for I was but a boy and feared that I should never see him or home again, and stood ready to go. The General called in servants with rich dresses, and preventing me from putting up any of the clothes I had borrowed of Colonel Symes, enveloped me in several sumptuous cloaks and shawls, putting a sort of cap on my head, and preceded me down-stairs, with many tokens of respect. On reaching the door, the band made a grand crash of horns, and cymbals, and drums, to salute me; a splendidly caparisoned horse was led up, which I was told to mount; and surrounded by the troops, we went in triumph through the town. As we passed Colonel Symes' quarters, I saw him looking out of his door with great astonishment, and tried to speak to him, but the guard closed up around me, and I could only wave a sad farewell as we passed on. 
               Reaching the river side, I found the array on the water even more imposing than that on the land. There could not have been less than fifty boats, each of them forty feet long, broad and shallow, and filled with oarsmen. First, in one went the General and his officers; then in another the horrible band; then I followed, the only passenger, in the most highly decorated of them all; then another boat, with my cooks and their apparatus; then boats laden deep with provisions, boats with my wardrobe, from which several times a day changes of dress were brought me; and, as far as I could see, boats filled with soldiers and attendants. Every night (and we were several days on the voyage) we went ashore, and they built me a house, which was pulled down the next morning, according to their custom, which does not allow an inferior person to live in a house which had once been occupied by one of my supposed rank. Every luxury they could procure was spread on my table. I had no reason to complain of my living, though the dishes were strange to me, and I had to eat them without knife or fork. There was no end to the distant honors they paid me; but I was very lonely, with none to talk to, and no one to understand a word I said when any one came near enough. My thoughts were very sad, and my apprehensions of danger constant. I felt like a gaily dressed beast going to a slaughter-house; and not a little of my trouble rose from anxiety about the piece goods. 
               In this way we pulled up the river until we arrived at the city, where thousands of troops, with yet more dissonant and louder music, awaited my landing. A splendid horse was brought for me, which, after putting on the finest of the dresses, making me look more like a woman than a man, I mounted. The whole population were in the streets gazing on the splendid procession, which conducted me to a house as grand as a palace in the middle of the town. There scores of servants anticipated all my wants, and a bed like one of our own, only more showily decorated, awaited my repose. That night, overcome by fatigue of mind and body, I slept soundly, forgetting my utter loneliness among thousands who were as ignorant of my language as I was of theirs. 
               The next morning, after my solitary breakfast, an officer of the court presented himself, with an interpreter, bearing a message of welcome from the King to his Excellency the Ambassador from the vast and glorious Republic of France. I lost no time in assuring the officer, through the interpreter, that there must have been an unaccountable blunder in taking me for an ambassador from France, as I was not even a Frenchman, and begging him to tell the king so, that I might go back to the cargo of piece goods which had been intrusted to my care. The only answer I got was that the King hoped the most honorable Ambassador would find himself satisfied with the arrangements made for his comfort during his stay in the city. Another weary day, and another, and another, when the officer again came to say that the King hoped in a short time to have a conference with the Ambassador respecting a commercial mercial treaty, which His Majesty was glad to hear the Republic of France wished to make with him. More earnestly than ever I entreated the interpreter, who spoke English quite well, to let the King know how much I was embarrassed by the mistaken notion that I was anything else than a supercargo of a large venture in piece goods, and that the interests of my principals might suffer severely from my involuntary absence. A low salaam as the officer left me was his only reply. Every morning the same was repeated, I becoming each time more urgent for an interview, that the vexatious blunder might be put an end to, but in vain. My quarters were good, my table well supplied with their curious dishes and a profusion of French wines. If I intimated a wish to go out, my horse came immediately to the door; but I could go nowhere without a close guard of cavalry about me. On one of those excursions I saw my friend Colonel Symes in a sort of balcony, who recognized me, changed as my appearance was, yet could not get near enough to speak to him, for my escort hurried on, with loud shouts of "Honor to the illustrious Ambassador of the vast and glorious Republic of France!" the language of which, by this time, I had learned only too well. 
               Three months and more passed on in this way, when at last the officer announced that His Majesty had been pleased to appoint the next day for the appearance at court of the Ambassador of the Republic of France. Now, thought I, my troubles will be at an end, for the King will certainly see that a smooth-chinned lad of nineteen, who cannot speak any language but English, could never be the Ambassador of the French Republic. 
               Accordingly, at the hour, robed in the ceremonial garments they brought me, I set out with ten times my ordinary escort to the palace, which was near the city gate, the procession taking a wide dtour through the principal streets, while the soldiers and populace redoubled their acclamations in honor of the Ambassador from the Republic of France. On entering the palace, I was ushered into a large hall, filled with a multitude of people squatting on their legs, their heads bowed to the ground in the direction of an opening at the upper end, screened by a curtain. The attendants led me to the front, and then with courteous but irresistible strength, forced me down to the true posture of the rest. After waiting some little time, the curtain was drawn aside, and the King, enthroned on a sort of wagon, was wheeled into the apartment. The multitude beat their heads on the floor in silence, when he beckoned me to draw near him. 
               "I have the high felicity," said he, by an interpreter, "of seeing the Ambassador of the Republic of France at my court." 
               "Your Majesty is very much mistaken," I replied; "I am not a French ambassador, but a young American, sent out by -- & Co., of --, as supercargo of a vessel laden with piece goods, which was unfortunately wrecked near the mouth of the river, and I entreat your Majesty to let me go back to my duties." 
               "I have unmeasured satisfaction in hearing from you, most distinguished sir," the King answered, "the pleasing assurances of friendship and good-will from so vast and glorious a republic as that of France." 
               "I brought no such message, please your Majesty, and never told the interpreter anything of the kind. He deceives you, and will not tell you what I say." 
               "I know now," the King rejoined, "what the wishes of the Republic of France are, and will give my prime minister orders to draw up a treaty on that basis, which to-morrow will be submitted for your Excellency's approval." 
                
               "Please your Majesty, I have stated no such thing. I cannot negotiate with your minister for France. I said that I was only a supercargo of a speculation in piece goods, and it is the fault of the interpreters that your Majesty did not know this long ago. I have been putting you to expense and wasting several months for nothing, and I earnestly entreat your Majesty to let me go back to my captain and the cargo." 
               With a benign smile the King rose and addressed me: 
               "I cannot express my satisfaction with your cordial assent to the proposed plan of a treaty which we will now consider definitely fixed, awaiting only your signature and that of my minister, when the instrument shall have been prepared, as it will be to-morrow. I shall also cause your government to be made acquainted with the profound regard I entertain for your skill in managing the negotiations. Wishing you all personal happiness, I part from you with the hope that your diplomatic career will be always as successful, though I must add that, never before (and here an arch expression betrayed itself at the corner of his mouth) have I transacted business with so young an ambassador." 
               The audience was over, and under a grand escort I returned to my lodgings. That night a half-dozen men carried me in a close palanquin to the river, put me in a small boat, and without any other attendants pulled me night and day down the river to the coast, where I found the Captain just ready to sail in a barque he had loaded with our piece goods. After a few days we were off, and I had no desire whatever to change again the Yankee supercargo for a French ambassador. Our subsequent trading was not unprofitable, and though the wreck and delays occasioned temporary losses, we made a good voyage for our owners. I retained some relics of my involuntary grandeur deur, and among the rest a little ebony casket, on opening which I found a permit from his Majesty of Ava to bring two cargoes of piece goods into his dominions duty free; a privilege I availed myself of, sending, however, another supercargo, as I had no notion of running the risk of being taken again for a Frenchman, or an ambassador. 
               You have looked and laughed incredulously, gentlemen, during my story; but the secret of the mystery was simply this: Col. Symes
                     We do not remember positively that the officer alluded to was Col. Symes; but the name resembled Symes; and as a Col. Symes did, about that time, visit Ava on an embassy, we think it so probable that he was the man, as to risk inserting the name.
                   was eager to press upon Burmah a commercial treaty, which the king was disinclined to for many reasons; yet fearing British anger, he temporized with the cunning of a semi-barbarian, and to put off the Colonel, he passed me off, as he thought, as an ambassador from France, excusing himself from an audience to Symes on the ground that he was unwilling at once to break with the French, though unwilling to grant them terms. Whether or not he succeeded in deceiving Col. Symes, you can judge; but the ruse answered his purpose for the time. It did not, however, console me to discover that I had been made an unconscious agent in baffling so long my kind English friend, who subsequently, however, succeeeded in making a treaty with the king. 
             
             
                
               XIV. ELEGANT TOM DILLAR. 
                
                  CHAPTER I. 
                  To speak of Tom Dillar in any other way than by his pseudonyme of Elegant, would be like speaking of Harold Harefoot, Edwin the Fair, the Black Prince, or Louis the Debonair, without their distinguishing adjectives. Tom Dillar was known to his acquaintances only as Elegant Tom, and he was well entitled to the epithet, for he was elegant in looks, manners, and style. He was one of those happy persons who seem to have come into the world for the sole purpose of eating the sunny side of ripe peaches. There were no deficiencies in Elegant Tom Dillar, and if one could have the ordering of his own antecedents, they could not be superior to Tom's. On the side of his father, he was connected with the best English families in the State; and, by the mother's side, he could boast of the purest Dutch descent. He inherited a large fortune from his father, and, what was much better, a healthy constitution and a handsome person. Being independent in his circumstances, he was not educated for a profession; but, being apt to learn, he was taught a good many accomplishments that are not generally bestowed upon American youths. He could dance much better than most professors of that elegant art; and in music he was something more than a proficient upon the guitar, the piano, and the violin. Then he had a fine voice-a delicious tenor-and those who had the good fortune to hear him sing used to boast of it, as though a piece of rare luck had befallen them. Tom was good-natured, too; and as amiable as though it were necessary for him to conciliate the world, that his presence might not be considered an intrusion. But, of all men, he was least likely to be considered de trop in the world. 
                  He went abroad, and came back as amiable and unpretending as he went, but with more accomplishments than he carried away. He was invited everywhere, and he might have married any girl he chose to honor in that manner; but, as often happens in such cases, he seemed never to have been touched in his heart by any of the beautiful creatures who surrounded him. There was Fanny Ormolu, the only daughter of the great auctioneer, who, they used to say, was dying for him; and it was said that her father was so fearful of the effects of Tom's indifference on his daughter's health, that he was guilty of the indelicacy of offering to settle a hundred thousand dollars on him if he would marry her. But Tom had never known what it was to want money, and, like an honorable, high-minded fellow as he was, refused to sell himself, even at so high a figure, and to so beautiful a purchaser. 
                  They say that old Ormolu was so exasperated and indignant at Tom's refusal, that he swore he would have satisfaction for the insult; and he was as good as his word. He did not challenge Tom, nor, indeed, permit him to know that he entertained any ill-will against him; for, if he had, he probably would not have been able to accomplish his purpose. Ormolu was a commercial gentleman, and his manner of getting satisfaction was a purely business transaction: in fact, the old fellow did not understand anything else. He set himself deliberately to work to ruin Tom by getting away all his money. As this would have been the severest punishment that could have been inflicted upon himself, he naturally and very sensibly imagined that he could inflict no greater wrong upon another than by making him a bankrupt. 
                  Now, Tom was not a spendthrift, nor a gambler; but then he was the merest child in business matters, and had no idea about money transactions beyond drawing his dividends every six months, and contriving to make his income just meet his expenditure. Tom had often wished that his income was larger, for he had long been ambitious of owning a yacht, but was unable to indulge in that costly enjoyment; so, when his young friend, Pete Van Slicer, of the firm of Van Slicer, Son & Co., the great stockbrokers, of Wall street, one day said to him, as if by accident, "Tom, how would you like to enter into a little speculation, by which you might make a hundred thousand dollars or so?" Tom opened his eyes, and eagerly replied he would like nothing better. 
                  Pete then carelessly remarked that Bob So-and-So had made nearly double that sum a few days before, by a corner in Harlem, and that he could put Tom in the way of making at least that amount by a speculation in Pottawattamy Coal Stock. Tom, not being familiar with stock operations, asked how it could be done; whereupon Pete explained to him that certain parties, having sold long in the stock, were going to get up a corner, which would compel the shorts to buy in, and that the stock would then begin to rise, and there was no knowing where it would stop. What Pete proposed that Tom should do was, to buy in while it was down, and when the rise should reach its height to sell out, and pocket the profits. 
                  "Can I rely on the rise taking place?" asked Tom, who had not a very clear notion of the nature of the transaction. 
                   
                  "Trust to me," replied Pete, with a knowing wink, which seemed to Tom so full of sagacity, that he concluded to trust to him, and accordingly gave an order to the firm of Van Slicer, Son & Co. to purchase, for his account, about ten times as many shares of the Pottawattamy Coal Stock as he had the means to pay for, Pete undertaking to carry the stock, as he called it, for thirty days, in which time the rise was sure to occur. 
                  Having made this little business arrangement with his Wall street friend, Tom jumped into one of the Dry Dock stages, to go up to the ship-yards and make inquiries about the cost of a yacht; and that night he dreamed of winning the Queen's cup at the Cowes regatta, and of lying at anchor in the harbor of Newport, and other pleasant things connected with the manly sport of yachting. 
                  Tom did not know that his friend, Pete Van Slicer, was paying attention to Fanny Ormolu; and, even if he had, he would never have imagined that old Ormolu was making use of the young stockbroker to ruin his friend. But such was the fact. 
                  The next day the Elegant Tom Dillar created a good deal of surprise among the motley throng of Jews and "lame ducks" that hover round the doors of the Stock Board in the third story of the Merchants' Exchange; and when a playful Hebrew knocked Tom's hat over his eyes, as he stood anxiously waiting to hear what Pottawattamy sold at, he was so engrossed in his new speculation, that he never thought of resenting the affront. Pottawattamy went up one per cent. that day, but the next it went down ten, and the next ten more, and Tom received a brief note from Van Slicer, Son & Co., informing him that he was their debtor for losses on Pottawattamy Coal Stock, in a sum that considerably exceeded his entire fortune. 
                  A man who has never felt the actual cautery of poverty, cannot have a very clear idea of what that word really means, and Tom did not, therefore, feel half so badly as he ought to have done, when he had to confess to himself that he was a bankrupt. 
                  There is nothing to be gained by going into the distressing particulars of Tom's settlement with his brokers, and therefore I will merely remark, that on the very day upon which all his available property passed out of his hands into those of Van Slicer, Son & Co., the junior member of that eminent firm was united in the holy bonds of matrimony, as the papers say, to Fanny Ormolu, only daughter, and so forth, of Jefferson Ormolu, Esq., our enterprising and esteemed fellow-citizen, of the eminent firm of Ormolu, Bronze & Co. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER II. 
                  THE ruin of Thomas Dillar, Esq., was complete. Wall street never witnessed a more decided cleaning out than in the case of my elegant friend. It was so smoothly and rapidly done, that he was like the man who didn't know he was decapitated until he attempted to nod his head-so sharply, so adroitly, and so quickly, had the blow been dealt. But it does not take long for a person to find out that he is poor, and Elegant Tom Dillar immediately began to have a "realizing sense" of the true state of his case. He had nothing in the world left but his watch, and a few articles of jewelry, by which he could raise money enough to discharge the few debts he owed, and which were demanded with a rude pertinacity that he had never known before. He had to abandon the hotel in Broadway at which he had been living, and take cheap lodgings in Beekman street; and, instead of having more invitations to dine than he could accept, he suddenly found himself without any invitation at all; as to evening parties, although he had made up his mind not to go to any more, he had the mortification of being cut by all his old friends, and soon ceased to expect any attentions from them. Heretofore Tom had skimmed the cream of human existence; he had visited only in the best circles, eaten the best dinners, drank the best wines, read the most amusing books, worn the best clothes, and had known nothing of the infelicities of human existence, except by hearsay. But now his turn had come to feed on husks, and taste of hyssop. 
                  What Tom had suffered, or how he had struggled, none knew but himself, for he was too proud to complain, and, to all appearances, he was as light-hearted and cheerful as ever he had been in his most prosperous days. But, as the writer of these lines was one evening hurrying down Broadway, to escape from the clouds of blinding dust which a cold, north-west wind was driving along that crowded avenue, he was suddenly arrested, near the corner of Canal street, by a tap on the shoulder. Turning round, he saw Elegant Tom Dillar, with his coat buttoned closely up to his throat, and looking uncomfortably sharp, serious, and, to make use of a vulgar figure of speech, seedy. 
                  "How are you?" said Tom, in his usual elegant manner; but, without waiting for a reply, he continued: "You needn't ask me how I am, for I can discern by your looks that you see how I am. I am hungry." 
                  Elegant Tom Dillar hungry! 
                  I was too much shocked by this humiliating confession from a man whom I had known and envied in his happier days, to disguise my feelings. But I put my hand in my pocket to feel for my purse. 
                  "Thank you," said Tom, "it is very generous of you to anticipate my request. It is but a trifle that I need; and I will repay you soon." 
                  I offered him the contents of my purse; but he would not take more than half a dollar. "At least," said I, "allow me to treat you to a supper, since you say you are hungry?" 
                  "I will agree to that," he replied, "upon the condition that you favor me with your company, and allow me to call for what I want." 
                  Of course I could not refuse his proposition, and knowing what his former habits had been, I supposed he would go into some of the splendid restaurants on Broadway, and call for such a supper as he had once been accustomed to indulge in. But, on the contrary, he led me into one of the cross streets, and I followed him down into a very humble underground "Saloon," where he ordered a supper of cold meat and bread, and I could not prevail upon him to indulge in anything more. 
                  "You know something of my history," said Tom, "how I once lived, and how I lost my property; but how I have lived since, you do hot know, and I shall not distress you by telling. Look," said he, and he unbuttoned his threadbare coat, when I saw that he had on neither vest nor shirt. "I am actually reduced to this extreme," said he, and his voice quivered as he spoke, "by trying to live honestly. Up to this very hour, until I met you, I have not stooped to beg; but now I was driven to it. I had nothing left by which I could raise a shilling, and I had not tasted food to-day." 
                  "Good heavens!" said I, "can this be true? What! Elegant Tom Dillar, with all his accomplishments, his rich acquaintances, his knowledge of the world, and in a city like this, where employment is so readily obtained, reduced to starvation! It cannot be true." 
                   
                  "But it is true," said Tom, "impossible as it may seem to you, and all because I was not brought up to a regular profession. My accomplishments were not of a kind to bring me money in an honorable way, and I made up my mind that if I could not live honorably, I would prefer not to live at all. I could easily have sold myself to unworthy or disreputable employments, or my former friends would probably have been glad to have had me sing for them, and have rewarded me by permitting me to live on their bounty, but I could not submit to such a position as that. I could never be a jack-pudding of society; and I would not disgrace my father's name by a dishonorable occupation." 
                  As Tom spoke these words, he looked more elegant in his shabby suit than ever he had done in his happier days; and in spite of his poverty, I could not but still admire his manly spirit and self-reliance. I actually felt poor beside him. 
                  "But," said I, "why will you not allow me to lend you a larger sum than you have taken? You shall be heartily welcome to more." 
                  "Because," replied Tom, "it is all I need. I think I have found a placer, and after this I shall be rich again." 
                  I wished his expectations might be realized, and shaking his hand, I gave him my card, and begged he would send to me, if he should need any further assistance. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER III. 
                  IT was about three months after I parted with Tom in the cheap restaurant, that, as I entered the vestibule of the Astor House, I met him coming out of that hotel. I started back with amazement as I saw him, for Tom was now dressed with greater splendor than I had ever before seen him; not obtrusively made up, but with an air of studied elegance that was new to him. Certainly he never looked better, nor better deserved to be called Elegant Tom Dillar. He appeared a little embarrassed when he first caught my eye, but his old manner soon returned. "I owe you a trifle, I think," said he; "let me pay it." And he pulled out a silk purse which seemed to be full of gold and silver, and reached me a half-dollar. 
                  "That is the principal," said he; "now do me the favor to accept this for interest;" and he took a handsome sealring from his finger, which he put upon mine. As our initials were the same, I do not know whether he had had it cut for me or not; but seeing my cypher on the agate, I fancied he had, and did not refuse it. I kept it among my most precious mementoes of past friendships, for Tom Dillar is one of those persons whose acquaintance I regard as a feather in my cap. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER IV. 
                  THE reappearance of Elegant Tom Dillar in what is called society, was a topic of universal conversation in fashionable circles, and once more invitations began to pour in upon him, so that he might, if he had had the capacity, have eaten three dinners daily at the very best houses in town, and have danced in the most brilliant company that New York could afford, nearly every night. But a great change was perceptible in Tom's manner. He was the same Elegant Tom Dillar he had ever been; faultless in his manner, refined in his conversation, incredible in dress, and handsomer, if possible, than before his retirement. "But he is so subdued in his style," was the remark of everybody. He never danced, and when he was pressed to sing, he always evaded the request by pleading a slight hoarseness. There used to be a slight dash of frivolity in Tom's conversation and conduct, and he would abandon himself to all kinds of merriment; but now he was rather grave, quiet, and dignified, and several ambitious young men made most melancholy attempts to form themselves upon his style. Another of his changes was, that he wore his hair cut very short, and his fine classical head was improved by it. In fact, Tom's new style was infinitely more interesting, becoming, and distingue than his old. Certain pious ladies got their heads together, and, after discussing the matter, came to the conclusion that Tom Dillar was preparing himself for the ministry. This suspicion even gave a new interest to him, and he became more than ever an object of observation. But this theory was soon exploded; for, if Tom was engaged in so pious an occupation, under whose auspices was he studying? On hearing the report, Tom smiled sarcastically, and raised his eyebrows as people do when they are both surprised and amused, but did not deny it. But, if he was not studying for the ministry, what was he doing, and how did he live? Where did he get his money? for it was known that Tom paid as he went, and not a soul of his acquaintance could accuse him of borrowing. 
                  These questions began to grow extremely interesting and puzzling, for the manner in which Tom had been cleaned out by his speculation in Pottawattamy Coal Stock, by his friend, Pete Van Slicer, was as notorious as his subsequent poverty, and retirement from the world. All sorts of expedients were resorted to for the purpose of discovering the secret of Tom's income; but the mystery baffled the keenest investigation, and the consequence was, that the wildest conceivable stories were told about him, and he was regarded with looks of suspicion, and treated with cold disdain by certain ladies who had marriageable daughters. The excitement at last reached its calenture when it was discovered that Julia Laurens, daughter of the celebrated and wealthy physician of that name, and granddaughter of old Ormolu the auctioneer, one of the most beautiful and fascinating girls in society, had actually fallen in love with Tom, and that he had been forbidden her father's house because he refused to tell how he gained his income. 
                  The report of this interesting circumstance invested the mystery of Tom's prosperity with a romantic interest, and the excitement became absolutely furious. It was impossible to enter a house without hearing the subject discussed, and even merchants talked about it on 'Change. The different theories which were broached were highly instructive, inasmuch as they revealed the many different methods by which a man may contrive to live without labor; but it so happened that not one of them came within a thousand miles of the truth. Tom had, in fact, discovered a placer, as he termed it, which he alone knew how to work; and most discreetly did he keep his secret, until, in a luckless moment, the merest accident revealed it. 
                  The women, poor simple-minded creatures, knowing but little of the world, had their own innocent surmises about Tom, the most plausible of which was, that he had entered into a league with the -- some other ladies, who had a less practical acquaintance with human possibilities believed that he got his money by writing poems for the magazines; while others said that he gambled. But Tom's regular habits, and his placidity of temper, were adverse to the last supposition. The men, of course, gave shrewder guesses; and one party maintained, with some plausibility, that Tom Dillar was employed as a Russian spy. The difficulty in this case was, that he never received any foreign letters, was notoriously ignorant of political movements, and never mingled in any society where he would be likely to pick up any information that would interest the Emperor of Russia. Another party maintained that he speculated in stocks; but that theory was easily knocked in the head: Tom had hot been in Wall street since his speculation in the Pottawattamy Coal Stock. Some ill-natured people hinted that he was employed in circulating counterfeit money; but he was closely watched, and was never known to pass off a bad bill. He was accused of picking pockets, of buying lottery-tickets, and other disreputable practices: but the strict integrity of Tom's conduct, and his perfect frankness on all subjects concerning himself, except that impenetrable mystery of the source of his income, put every ungenerous suspicion to rest. He was watched when he went from a party, or the opera, and was always found to go directly to his lodgings, and there, too, would he be found in the morning. Julia Laurens's father had employed a police officer to dodge Tom's footsteps, and discover what his haunts were; but the man could learn nothing more than was already known. There was one rather striking peculiarity, however, about Tom's movements, which might lead to the discovery of the mystery. Nobody had seen him, except on Sunday nights, between the hours of seven and ten. Every place of amusement in the city was ransacked in vain, during these hours, but no sign of Tom Dillar could anywhere be found; and he continued to be a talk in society, where he was still well received in spite of all the evil things that were surmised about him. 
                  Julia Laurens was a spirited girl, and she loved Tom the better, perhaps, because he was the object of so much unjust suspicion; and her father, the doctor, was charmed by Tom's intelligence, his gentlemanly manners, his fine taste, and his amiability; and most happy would he have been to acknowledge him as his son-in-law, but with the mysterious silence which he observed in respect to his income. But, as Tom was resolute in his silence, the father of Julia was inexorable, and there was nothing left for them but a clandestine marriage. The lady hinted at her willingness, but Tom told her, dearly as he loved her, he would not be guilty of a dishonorable act to obtain her. He would wait a little longer, and perhaps her father would relent. 
                  To fully appreciate Tom's noble conduct, it should be known that Julia, in addition to her expectations from her father's property, which was already large, and rapidly increasing, had property of her own, valued at fifty thousand dollars, which had been bequeathed to her by an aunt. All this Tom might have had, and the woman he loved besides, but for his high-minded sense of honor. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER V. 
                  DOCTOR LAURENS, Julia's father, was a most passionate lover of music, and you were always sure of seeing him in his box at the opera, in his bright-buttoned coat, with lorgnette in hand, listening to the prima donna as though she were a patient, and he anticipated a fee at the close of the performance. He was so catholic in his taste that he could enjoy one kind of music as well as another; and when there was no opera, and his patients would permit it, he would go to hear the Ethiopian minstrels, and sit through the entire performance. In fact the banjo was one of the Doctor's weaknesses, and there were some people who were uncharitable enough to say that negro minstrelsy was much better adapted to his musical taste than the Italian opera. But that was mere scandal, of course, for the Doctor had been in Europe, and had brought back with him, like many other gentlemen who go abroad, a taste for music and the fine arts, which he did not carry with him. 
                  There was one member of the Ethiopian band, where the Doctor was in the habit of going, who had completely fascinated him; which was not much to be wondered at, for he had fascinated everybody else who heard him; and when he appeared, there was sure to be an overflowing house. The name of this incomparable singer was Higgins, and his talents as a banjo-player, as a dancer, and a personator of the negro character, particularly as the negro dandy, were equal to his splendid abilities as a singer. The Doctor never failed to drop into the Ethiopian opera, as it was called, whenever this public favorite appeared, which was nearly every night, and seeing his name up on the bills for a benefit, the Doctor resolved to go. On reaching the hall he found the house so crowded that he could not even get his nose inside, but the door-keeper recognized him, and wishing to gratify so distinguished a patron of the establishment, offered to show him round by a private entrance, so that he would be near the stage, and might retire at his leisure. 
                  The Doctor was delighted, and put something handsome into the hand of the door-keeper, as an acknowledgment for the favor. He got a comfortable seat near the stage, and waited with impatience for the appearance of the incomparable Higgins. The sham darkey was in splendid voice, and filled the audience with ecstatic pleasure by his happy imitations of Dandy Jim. But his most brilliant performance was in the plantation break-down, in which he ravished the spectator tator by his unparalleled heeling and toeing. In the midst of the performance, when the frenzy of the spectators was at its height, a boy in the gallery threw a piece of orange-peel on the stage, and Higgins, by an unlucky step, put his foot upon it, and fell with a tremendous crash. The audience at first thought it a part of the dance, and applauded tremendously, but it was soon discovered that the poor man had met with a serious accident. He was taken up by his companions, and borne off the stage; directly after, the leader of the band came on, and asked if there was a surgeon in the house, as Mr. Higgins was badly hurt by his fall. Doctor Laurens was but too happy to have an opportunity of rendering any professional service to so distinguished an artist as Higgins; so he stepped promptly forward and offered his services. The artist had struck his head, but was only stunned. The Doctor, however, did as all doctors do on such occasions, whipped out his lancet, and bled the patient, while one of his companions, with a bowl of water and a sponge, wiped the burnt cork from the face of the unconscious minstrel. 
                  Higgins presently opened his eyes, and stared wildly about him, while the Doctor shrieked out, 
                  "Good gracious, it is Elegant Tom Dillar!" 
                  Tom was bewildered by the sudden change of the scene, and faint and sick from the loss of the blood which Doctor Laurens had been letting out of his veins; but, bewildered and weak as he was, the sound of the Doctor's voice, and the sight of his astonished countenance, brought Tom to his senses. He knew at once that his secret was discovered, and comprehended in a moment the consequences that must follow its revelation to society. 
                  "Doctor," said he, faintly, "it is no use to dissemble further. You know my secret; let me request you to keep it to yourself." 
                   
                  "Oh! my dear fellow," said the Doctor, 'you are perfectly safe in my hands; don't be uneasy. For the credit of my own family, at least, I shall not be likely to proclaim to any society that a gentleman who visited at my house is a member of a troupe of Ethiopian minstrels. I wish you a good evening, sir." 
                  It very oddly happened that, before midnight, all the members of the Manhattan Club, to which the Doctor belonged, knew that Elegant Tom Dillar had retrieved his fortunes by joining the Ethiopian minstrels, and the news was spread all through society before the next day at noon. 
                  Tom received a package early in the morning from Julia, inclosing all the billets-doux and trinkets he had sent her, and requesting a return of all she had ever sent him. The note was as devoid of feeling or sentiment as a lawyer's dunning letter; and Tom wrote one in reply, which was quite as cold and business-like. 
                  "Well," said I to Tom, on meeting him a few days after his accident, which would very likely have proved fatal to him but for his woolly wig, "do you intend to give up society or the minstrels?" 
                  "Society!" exclaimed Elegant Tom Dillar, with a sarcastic curve of his finely chiselled lip; "society be --." 
                  I will not repeat the very coarse expression he used; for, since his new associations, he has grown rather rude and low in his language. 
                  "What should an honest man care for society?" said he. "When I was an idler, living on the property which my father's industry had procured me, society petted me and cherished me. When I lost my property, society turned a cold shoulder to me, but petted the villain who had robbed me of it. When by an honest exercise of the only accomplishments I had been taught, I was enabled to appear like a gentleman, society again received me with open arms, although it imagined I was a gambler or a pickpocket; but, when it was found that my money was honestly obtained-that I wronged no one, or owed any one-society rejects me again, and the girl who was willing to marry me as a swindler, turns her back upon me as an honest man." 
                  I am afraid that Tom was misanthropical; for, as he soon after became possessed of a considerable fortune by the death of a relative, he quitted the minstrels and went to Paris, where, I have heard, he still lives in great splendor, and is famous for his dinners, to which none of his countrymen are ever invited. 
                
             
             
                
               XV. A TOSS-UP FOR A HUSBAND. 
               FROM THE FRENCH OF VISCOMTE PONSON DU TERRAIL. 
                
                  I. 
                  THE Marchioness was at her toilet. Florine and Aspasia, her two ladies'-maids, were busy powdering, as it were with hoar-frost, the bewitching widow. 
                  She was a widow, this Marchioness; a widow of twenty-three; and wealthy, as very few persons were any longer at the court of Louis XV., her godfather. 
                  Three-and-twenty years earlier, his Majesty had held her at the baptismal font of the chapel at Marly, and had settled upon her an income of a hundred thousand livres, by way of proving to her father, the Baron Fontevrault, who had saved his life at the battle of Fontenoy, that kings can be grateful, whatever people choose to say to the contrary. 
                  The Marchioness then was a widow. She resided, during the summer, in a charming little chateau, situated half-way up the slope overhanging the water, on the road from Bougival to Saint Germain. Madame Dubarry's estate adjoined hers; and on opening her eyes she could see, without rising, the white gable-ends and the wide-spreading chestnut-trees of Luciennes, perched upon the heights. On this particular day-it was noon-the Marchioness, whilst her attendants dressed her hair and arranged her head-dress with the most exquisite taste, gravely employed herself in tossing up, alternately, a couple of fine oranges, which crossed each other in the air, and then dropped into the white and delicate hand that caught them in their fall. 
                  This sleight-of-hand-which the Marchioness interrupted at times whilst she adjusted a beauty-spot on her lip, or cast an impatient glance on the crystal clock that told how time was running away with the fair widow's precious moments-had lasted for ten minutes, when the folding-doors were thrown open, and a valet, such as one sees now only on the stage, announced with pompous voice-"The King!" 
                  Apparently, the Marchioness was accustomed to such visits, for she but half rose from her seat, as she saluted with her most gracious smile the personage who entered. 
                  It was indeed Louis XV. himself-Louis XV. at sixty-five; but robust, upright, with smiling lip and beaming eye, and jauntily clad in a close-fitting, pearl-grey hunting-suit, that became him to perfection. He carried under his arm a handsome fowling-piece, inlaid with mother-of-pearl; a small pouch, intended for ammunition alone, hung over his shoulder. 
                  The King had come from Luciennes almost alone, that is to say, with a Captain of the Guard, the old Marshal de Richelieu, and a single equerry on foot. He had been amusing himself with quail-shooting, loading his own gun, as was the fashion with his ancestors, the later Valois and the earlier Bourbons. His grandsire, Henry IV., could not have been less ceremonious. 
                  But a shower of hail had surprised him; and his Majesty had no relish for it. He pretended that the fire of an enemy's battery was less disagreeable than those drops of water, so small and so hard, that wet him through, and reminded him of his twinges of rheumatism. 
                  Fortunately, he was but a few steps from the gateway of the chateau when the shower commenced. He had come, therefore, to take shelter with his goddaughter, having dismissed his suite, and only keeping with him a magnificent pointer, whose genealogy was fully established by the Duke de Richelieu, and traced back, with a few slips in orthography, directly to Nisus, that celebrated greyhound, given by Charles IX. to his friend Ronsard, the poet. 
                  "Good-morning, Marchioness," said the King, as he entered, putting down his fowling-piece in a corner, "I have come to ask your hospitality. We were caught in a shower at your gate-Richelieu and I. I have packed off Richelieu." 
                  "Ah, Sire, that wasn't very kind of you." 
                  "Hush!" replied the King, in a good-humored tone. "It's only mid-day; and if the Marshal had forced his way in here at so early an hour he would have bragged of it everywhere, this very evening. He is very apt to compromise one, and he is a great coxcomb, too, the old Duke. But don't put yourself out of the way, Marchioness. Let Aspasia finish this becoming pile of your head-dress, and Florine spread out with her silver knife the scented powder that blends so well with the lilies and the roses of your bewitching face. Why, Marchioness, you're so pretty, one could eat you up!" 
                  "You think me so, Sire?" 
                  "I tell you so every day. Oh, what fine oranges!" 
                  And the King seated himself upon the roomy sofa, by the side of the Marchioness, whose rosy finger-tips he kissed with an infinity of grace. Then, taking up one of the oranges that he had admired, he proceeded leisurely to examine it. 
                   
                  "But," said he at length, "what are oranges doing by the side of your Chinese powder-box and your scent-bottles? Is there any connection between this fruit and the maintenance-easy as it is, Marchioness-of your charms?" 
                  "These oranges," replied the lady, gravely, "fulfilled just now, Sire, the functions of destiny." 
                  The King opened wide his eyes, and stroked the long ears of his dog, by way of giving the Marchioness time to explain her meaning. 
                  "It was the Countess who gave them to me," she continued. 
                  "Madame Dubarry?" 
                  "Exactly so, Sire." 
                  "A trumpery gift, it seems to me, Marchioness." 
                  "I hold it, on the contrary, to be an important one; since I repeat to your Majesty, that these oranges decide my fate." 
                  "I give it up," said the King. 
                  "Imagine, Sire; yesterday I found the Countess occupied in tossing her oranges up and down this way." And the Marchioness recommenced her game with a skill that cannot be described. 
                  "I see," said the King; "she accompanied this singular amusement with the words, 'Up, Choiseul! up Praslin!' and, on my word, I can fancy how the pair jumped." 
                  "Precisely so, Sire." 
                  "And do you dabble in politics, Marchioness? Have you a fancy for uniting with the Countess, just to mortify my poor ministers?" 
                  "By no means, Sire; for, in place of Monsieur de Choiseul and the Duke de Praslin, I was saying to myself just now, 'Up, Menneval! up, Beaugency!'" 
                  "Aye, aye," returned the King; "and why the deuce would you have them jumping, those two good-looking gentlemen-Monsieur de Menneval, who is a Crsus, and Monsieur de Beaugency, who is a statesman, and dances the minuet to perfection." 
                  "I'll tell you," said the dame. "You know, Sire, that Monsieur de Menneval is an accomplished gentleman, a handsome man, a gallant cavalier, an indefatigable dancer, witty as Monsieur Arouet, and longing for nothing so much as to live in the country, on his estate in Touraine, on the banks of the Loire, with the woman whom he loves or will love, far from the court, from grandeur and from turmoil." 
                  "And, on my life, he's in the right of it," quoth the King. "One does become so wearied at court." 
                  "Aye, and no," rejoined the widow, as she put on her last beauty-spot. "Nor are you unaware, Sire, that Monsieur de Beaugency is one of the most brilliant courtiers of Marly and of Versailles; ambitious; burning with zeal for the service of your Majesty; as brave as Monsieur de Menneval; and capable of going to the end of the earth with the title of Ambassador of the King of France." 
                  "I know that," chimed in Louis XV., with a laugh. "But, alas, I have more ambassadors than embassies. My antechambers overflow every morning." 
                  "Now," continued the Marchioness, "I have been a widow these two years past." 
                  "A long time, there's no denying." 
                  "Ah," sighed she, "there's no need to tell me so, Sire. But Monsieur de Menneval loves me at least he says so, and I am easily persuaded." 
                  "Very well; then marry Monsieur de Menneval." 
                  "I have thought of it, Sire; and, in truth, I might do much worse. I should like well enough to live in the country, under the willow-trees, on the borders of the river, with a husband, fond, yielding, loving, who would detest the philosophers and set some little value on the poets. When no external noises disturb the honeymoon, that month, Sire, may be indefinitely prolonged. In the country, you know, one never hears a noise." 
                  "Unless it be the north wind moaning in the corridor, and the rain pattering on the window-panes." And the King shivered slightly on his sofa. 
                  "But," added the dame, "Monsieur de Beaugency loves me equally well." 
                  "Ah, ha! the ambitious man!" 
                  "Ambition does not shut out love, Sire. Monsieur de Beaugency is a marquis; he is twenty-five; he is ambitious. I should like a husband vastly who was longing to reach high office of state. Greatness has its own particular merit." 
                  "Then marry Monsieur de Beaugency." 
                  "I have thought of that, also; but this poor Monsieur de Menneval." 
                  "Very good," exclaimed the King, laughing: "now I see to what purposes the oranges are destined. Monsieur de Menneval pleases you; Monsieur de Beaugency would suit you just as well; and since one can't have more than one husband, you make them each jump in turn." 
                  "Just so, Sire. But observe what happens." 
                  "Ah, what does happen?" 
                  "That, unwilling and unable to play unfairly, I take equal pains to catch the two oranges as they come down; and that I catch them both, each time." 
                  "Well, are you willing that I should take part in your game?" 
                  "You, Sire? Ah, what a joke that would be!" 
                  "I am very clumsy, Marchioness. To a certainty, in less than three minutes Beaugency and Menneval will be rolling on the floor." 
                   
                  "Ah!" exclaimed the lady; "and if you have any preference for one or the other?" 
                  "No; we'll do better. Look, I take the two oranges you mark them carefully-or, better still, you stick into one of them one of these toilet pins, making up your own mind which of the two is to represent Monsieur de Beaugency, and leaving me, on that point, entirely in the dark. If Monsieur de Beaugency touch the floor, you shall marry his rival; if it happen just otherwise, you shall resign yourself to become an ambassadress." 
                  "Excellent! Now, Sire, let's see the result." 
                  The King took the two oranges and plied shuttle with them above his head. But, at the third pass, the two rolled down upon the embroidered carpet, and the Marchioness broke out into a merry fit of laughter. 
                  "I foresaw as much," exclaimed his Majesty. "What a clumsy fellow I am!" 
                  "And we more puzzled than ever, Sire!" 
                  "So we are, Marchioness; but the best thing we can do is to slice the oranges, sugar them well, and season them with a dash of West India rum. Then you can beg me to taste them, and offer me some of those preserved cherries and peaches that you put up just as nicely as my daughter Adelaide." 
                  "And Monsieur de Menneval? and Monsieur de Beaugency?" said the Marchioness, in piteous accents. "How is the question to be settled?" 
                  Louis XV. began to cogitate. 
                  "Are you quite sure," said he, "that both of them are in love with you." 
                  "Probably so," returned she, with a little coquettish smile, sent back to her from the mirror opposite. 
                  "And their love is equally strong?" 
                  "I trust so, Sire." 
                   
                  "And I don't believe a word of it." 
                  "Ah!" said the Marchioness; "but that is, in truth, a most terrible supposition. Besides, Sire, they are on their way hither." 
                  "Both of them?" 
                  "One after the other: the Marquis at one o'clock precisely; the Baron at two. I promised them my decision to-morrow, on condition that they would pay me a final visit to-day." 
                  As the Marchioness finished, the valet, who had announced the King, came to inform his mistress that Monsieur de Beaugency was in the drawing-room, and solicited the favor of admission to pay his respects. 
                  "Capital!" said Louis XV., smiling as though he were eighteen; "show Monsieur de Beaugency in. Marchioness, you will receive him, and tell him the price that you set upon your hand." 
                  "And what is this price, Sire?" 
                  "You must give him the choice-either to renounce you, or to consent to send in to me his resignation of his appointments, in order that he may go and bury himself with his wife on his estate of Courlac, in Poitou, there to live the life of a country gentleman.' 
                  "And then, Sire?" 
                  "You will allow him a couple of hours for reflection, and so dismiss him." 
                  "And in the end?" 
                  "The rest is my concern."-And the King got up, taking his dog and his gun, and concealed himself behind a screen, drawing also a curtain, that he might be completely hidden. 
                  "What is your intention, Sire?" asked the Marchioness. 
                  "I conceal myself, like the kings of Persia, from the eyes of my subjects," replied Louis XV. "Hush, Marchioness." 
                  A few moments later, and Monsieur de Beaugency entered the room. 
                
                
                  II. 
                  The Marquis was a charming cavalier; tall, slight, with a moustache black and curling upwards, an eye sparkling and intelligent, a Roman nose, an Austrian lip, a firm step, a noble and imposing presence. 
                  The Marchioness blushed slightly at sight of him, but offered him her hand to kiss; and as she begged him by a gesture to be seated, thus inwardly took counsel with herself: 
                  "Decidedly, I believe that the test is useless; it is Monsieur de Beaugency whom I love. How proud shall I be to lean upon his arm at the court-ftes! With what delight shall I keep long watches in the cabinet of his Excellency the Ambassador, while he is busy with his Majesty's affairs!" 
                  But after this "aside," the Marchioness resumed her gracious and coquettish air; as though the woman comprehended the mission of refined gallantry which was reserved for her seductive and delicate epoch by an indulgent Providence, that laid by its anger and its evil days for the subsequent reign. 
                  "Marchioness," said Monsieur de Beaugency, as he held in his hands the rosy fingers of the lovely widow, "it is fully a week since you received me!" 
                  "A week? why, you were here yesterday!" 
                  "Then I must have counted the hours for ages." 
                   
                  "A compliment which may be found in one of the younger Crebillon's books!" 
                  "You are hard upon me, Marchioness." 
                  "Perhaps so, it comes naturally I am tired." 
                  "Ah, Marchioness! Heaven knows that I would make of your existence one never-ending fte!" 
                  "That would, at least, be wearisome." 
                  "Say a word, Madam, one single word, and my fortune, my future prospects, my ambition!"- 
                  "You are still, then, as ambitious as ever?" 
                  "More than ever, since I have been in love with you." 
                  "Is that necessary?" 
                  "Beyond a doubt. Ambition-what is it but honors, wealth, the envious looks of impotent rivals, the admiration of the crowd, the favor of monarchs? And is not one's love unanswerably and most triumphantly proved, in laying all this at the feet of the woman whom one adores?" 
                  "You may be right." 
                  "I may be right, Marchioness! Listen to me, my fair lady-love." 
                  "I am all attention, sir." 
                  "Between us, who are well-born, and consort not with plebeians, that vulgar and sentimental sort of love which is painted by those who write books for your mantua-makers and chambermaids, would be in exceedingly bad taste. It would be but slighting love and making no account of its enjoyment, were we to go and bury it in some obscure corner of the provinces, or of Paris-we, who belong to Versailles-living away there with it, in monotonous solitude and unchanging contemplation!" 
                  "Ah!" said the Marchioness, "you think so?" 
                  "Tell me, rather, of ftes that dazzle one with lights, with noise, with smiles, with wit, through which one glides intoxicated, with the fair conquest in triumph on one's arm Why hide one's happiness, in place of parading it? The jealousy of the world does but increase, and cannot diminish it. My uncle, the Cardinal, stands well at court. He has the King's ear, and better still, the Countess's. He will, ere long, procure me one of the Northern embassies. Cannot you fancy yourself, Madame the Ambassadress, treading on the platform of a drawing-room, as royalty with royalty, with the highest nobility of a kingdom-having the men at your feet, and the women on lower seats around you, whilst you yourself are occupant of a throne, and wield a sceptre?" 
                  And as Monsieur de Beaugency warmed with his own eloquence, he gently slid from his seat to the knees of the Marchioness, whose hand he covered with kisses. 
                  She listened to him, with a smile on her lips, and then abruptly said to him: 
                  "Rise, sir, and hear me in turn. Are you in truth sincerely attached to me?" 
                  "With my whole soul, Marchioness!" 
                  "Are you prepared to make every sacrifice?" 
                  "Every one, Madam." 
                  "That is fortunate indeed; for to be prepared for all, is to accomplish one, without the slightest difficulty; and it is but a single one that I require." 
                  "Oh, speak! Must a throne be conquered?" 
                  "By no means, sir. You must only call to mind that you own a fine chateau in Poitou." 
                  "Pooh!" said Monsieur de Beaugency; "a shed." 
                  "Every man's house is his castle," replied the widow. "And having called it to mind, you need only order post-horses." 
                  "For what purpose?" 
                   
                  "To carry me off to Courlac. It is there that your almoner shall unite us, in the chapel, in presence of your domestics and your vassals, our only witnesses." 
                  "A singular whim, Marchioness; but I submit to it." 
                  "Very well. We will set out this evening. Ah! I forgot." 
                  "What, further?" 
                  "Before starting, you will send in your resignation to the King." 
                  Monsieur de Beaugency almost bounded from his seat. 
                  "Do you dream of that, Marchioness?" 
                  "Assuredly. You will not, at Courlac, be able to perform your duties at court." 
                  "And on returning?" 
                  "We will not return." 
                  "We will-not-return!" slowly ejaculated Monsieur de Beaugency. "Where then shall we proceed?" 
                  "Nowhere. We will remain at Courlac." 
                  "All the summer?" 
                  "And all the winter. I count upon settling myself there, after our marriage. I have a horror of the court. I do not like the turmoil. Grandeur wearies me I look forward only to a simple and charming country life, to the tranquil and happy existence of the forgotten lady of the castle. What matters it to you? You were ambitious for my love's sake. I care but little for ambition; you ought to care for it still less, since you are in love with me." 
                  "But, Marchioness-" 
                  "Hush! it's a bargain. Still, for form's sake, I give you one hour to reflect. There, pass out that way; go into the winter drawing-room that you will find at the end of the gallery, and send me your answer upon a leaf of your tablets. I am about to complete my toilet, which I left unfinished, to receive you." 
                  And the Marchioness opened a door, bowed Monsieur de Beaugency into the corridor, and closed the door upon him. 
                  "Marchioness," cried the King, from his hiding-place and through the screen, "you will offer Monsieur de Menneval the embassy to Prussia, which I promise you for him." 
                  "And you will not emerge from your retreat?" 
                  "Certainly not, Madame; it is far more amusing to remain behind the scenes. One hears all, laughs at one's ease, and is not troubled with saying anything." 
                  It struck two. Monsieur de Menneval was announced. His Majesty remained snug, and shammed dead. 
                
                
                  III. 
                  Monsieur de Menneval was, at all points, a cavalier who yielded nothing to his rival, Monsieur de Beaugency. He was fair. He had a blue eye, a broad forehead, a mouth that wore a dreamy expression, and that somewhat pensive air which became so well the troubadours of France in the olden time. 
                  We cannot say whether Monsieur de Menneval had perpetrated verse; but he loved the poets, the arts, the quiet of the fields, the sunsets, the rosy dawn, the breeze sighing through the foliage, the low and mysterious tones of the harp, sounding at eve from the light bark shooting over the blue waters of the Loire-all things, in short, that harmonize with that melodious concert of the heart, which passes by the name of love. 
                  He was timid, but he passionately loved the beautiful widow; and his dearest dream was of passing his whole life at her feet, in well-chosen retirement, far from those envious lookers-on who are ever ready to fling their sarcasms on quiet happiness, and who dissemble their envy under cloak of a philosophic scepticism. 
                  He trembled as he entered the Marchioness's boudoir. He remained standing before her, and blushed as he kissed her hand. At length, encouraged by a smile, emboldened by the solemnity of this coveted interview, he spoke to her of his love, with a poetic simplicity and an unpremeditated warmth of heart-the genuine enthusiasm of a priest who has faith in the object of his adoration. 
                  And as he spoke, the Marchioness sighed, and said within herself: 
                  "He is right. Love is happiness. Love is to be two indeed, but one at the same time; and to be free from those importunate intermeddlers, the indifference or the mocking attention of the world." 
                  She remembered, however, the advice of the King, and thus addressed the baron: 
                  "What will you indeed do, in order to convince me of your affection?" 
                  "All that man can do." 
                  The baron was less bold than Monsieur de Beaugency, who had talked of conquering a throne. He was probably more sincere. 
                  "I am ambitious," said the widow. 
                  "Ah!" replied Monsieur de Menneval, sorrowfully. 
                  "And I would that the man whom I marry should aspire to everything, and achieve everything." 
                  "I will try so to do, if you wish it." 
                  "Listen; I give you an hour to reflect. I am, you know, the King's goddaughter. I have begged of him an embassy for you." 
                   
                  "Ah!" said Monsieur de Menneval, with indifference. 
                  "He has granted my request. If you love me, you will accept the offer. We will be married this evening, and your Excellency the Ambassador to Prussia will set off for Berlin immediately after the nuptials. Reflect; I grant you an hour." 
                  "It is useless," answered Monsieur de Menneval; "I have no need of reflection, for I love you. Your wishes are my orders; to obey you is my only desire. I accept the embassy." 
                  "Never mind!" said she, trembling with joy, and blushing deeply. "Pass into the room, wherein you were just now waiting. I must complete my toilet, and I shall then be at your service. I will summon you." 
                  The Marchioness handed out the Baron by the right-hand door, as she had handed out the Marquis by the left, and then said to herself: 
                  "I shall be prettily embarrassed, if Monsieur de Beaugency should consent to end his days at Courlac!" 
                  Thereupon the King removed the screen and reappeared. 
                  His Majesty stepped quietly to the round table, whereon he had replaced the oranges, and took up one of them. 
                  "Ah!" exclaimed the Marchioness, "I perceive, Sire, that you foresee the difficulty that is about to spring up, and go back accordingly to the oranges, in order to settle it." 
                  As his sole reply, Louis XV. took a small ivory-handled penknife from his waistcoat pocket, made an incision in the rind of the orange, peeled it off very neatly, divided the fruit into two parts, and offered one to the astonished Marchioness. 
                  "But, Sire, what are you doing?" was her eager inquiry. 
                   
                  "You see that I am eating the orange." 
                  "But-" 
                  "It was of no manner of use to us." 
                  "You have decided, then?" 
                  "Unquestionably. Monsieur de Menneval loves you better than Monsieur de Beaugency." 
                  "That is not quite certain yet; let us wait." 
                  "Look," said the King, pointing to the valet, who entered with a note from the Marquis. "You'll soon see." 
                  The widow opened the note, and read: 
                  "Madam, I love you-Heaven is my witness; and to give you up is the most cruel of sacrifices. But I am a gentleman. A gentleman belongs to the King. My life, my blood are his. I cannot, without forfeit of my loyalty, abandon his service--." 
                  "Et cetera," chimed in the King, "as was observed by the Abb Fleury, my tutor. Marchioness, call in Monsieur Menneval." 
                  Monsieur de Menneval entered, and was greatly troubled to see the King in the widow's boudoir. 
                  "Baron," said his Majesty, "Monsieur de Beaugency was deeply in love with the Marchioness; but he was more deeply still in love-since he would not renounce it to please her-with the embassy to Prussia, And you, you love the Marchioness much better than you love me, since you would only enter my service for her sake. This leads me to believe that you would be but a lukewarm public servant, and that Monsieur de Beaugency will make an excellent ambassador. He will start for Berlin this evening; and you shall marry the Marchioness. I will be present at the ceremony." 
                  "Marchioness," whispered Louis XV., in the ear of his goddaughter, "true love is that which does not shrink from a sacrifice." 
                   
                  And the King peeled the second orange and eat it, as he placed the hand of the widow in that of the Baron. 
                  Then he added: 
                  "I have been making three persons happy: the Marchioness, whose indecision I have relieved; the Baron, who shall marry her; and Monsieur de Beaugency, who will perchance prove a sorry ambassador. In all this, I have only neglected my own interests, for I have been eating the oranges without sugar. And yet they pretend to say that I am a selfish Monarch!" 
                
             
             
                
               XVI. UNCLE BERNARD'S STORY. 
               "OH! Uncle Bernard," cried altogether a group of little people, "tell us a story." 
               Uncle Bernard, a white-haired old man, whose easy-chair had been drawn to a warm corner, for the winter was howling against the windows, looked up from his large-print Bible and smiled fondly on their rosy faces: 
               "A story! let me read you one out of this good book." 
               "Oh! no," says bold little Bob, as he caught the old man round the neck, "we know all the Bible stories; tell us a fairy tale!" 
               "Yes, yes! Uncle Bernard," chomped the rest, "a fairy tale, a fairy tale, a fairy tale; you have never told us a fairy tale." 
               "No, dears, I have never told you a fairy tale. Fairy tales are lies, and young folks, like you, should not love to hear lies, nor old folks like me should not tell lies." 
               "Oh! but Uncle Bernard, we know that fairy tales ain't true, but it is such fun to hear them." 
               "Well, my pets, I'll try to tell you a story that sounds like a fairy tale, and yet is all true. Sit down and listen: 
               "Once upon a time, and a great while ago, there lived in a wide wood a wild man, whose name was Sthenos. His father and mother had been keepers of a lovely garden, where they dwelt in peace with our good God; but he, very early in his childhood, had wandered far off and lost himself among the shadows of the forest, where he soon forgot all the little that he knew. Not only his head and face, but also his whole body, was covered with long shaggy hair; his nails were like claws, and he could climb the trees or swim in the water as easily as walk on the ground. Gigantic in height, his shoulders were broad and his limbs sturdy. He could outrun the swiftest deer, hit with a stone the flying bird, and kill with his knotty club the fiercest beasts. He ate only what he won in the chase, with some pleasant herbs, or fruits, or honey, which he found in hollow trunks, and among the rocks; and he drank only water from springs, or the deep river which flowed through the valley. He slept in caves or in the crotches of trees, lest the prowling beasts should catch him unawares. Yet, savage as he was, he had a certain nobleness and rough grace of mien which distinguished him as superior to the brutes around him, and made them acknowledge him as their lord. Thus he lived lonely and unhappy, and, notwithstanding his strength, full of fears. 
               "One day as he was pushing through a thicket to reach the river, he heard singing sweeter than any he had ever heard. He thought at first that it was a bird; but he knew the songs of all birds, and that this was not like any one of them. He dashed on, and saw reclining on the bank of the river a creature so lovely that he stood still in wonder, trembling with a new feeling that shot like fire through his heart and joints. Her form (his woodman's eye saw at once that the delicate proportions were those of a female) was something like his own; but fair and elegant, while his was brown and shaggy. Around her was cast a loose white robe, and about her shoulders floated a scarf, blue as the sky. While she sung she looked upwards as if some one was hearing her, whom Sthenos could not see, and then she listened as if to a voice lie could not hear. Soon turning her eyes upon him, she smiled with ravishing sweetness, and beckoned him nearer. Awe-struck, but drawn irresistibly on, he fell at her feet, gazing on her beautiful face. She spoke in accents of his early speech, which now came back to his understanding, and said: "'Sthenos, our good God, whom you have so long forgotten, has not forgotten, you; but pitying your loneliness and misery, has sent me to live with you and be your friend. Already I love you, and you must take me to your heart and give me your love.' 
               "As she spoke she bent down and wiped his forehead, from which she had parted his matted locks, looking with her clear blue eyes into his, until his whole being seemed drawn out to her, and he laid her head with its bright golden curls on his broad breast, and felt an ecstasy of inexpressible happiness. 
               "'And now that I am to dwell with you, dear Sthenos, lead me to your home!' 
               "'Home!' replied he, 'I know not what you mean!' 
               "'Where do you rest after the chase, or amidst the darkness? Where do you eat your food, and where do you most delight to be? That is home.' 
               "'I have no home. All places in the forest are alike to me. Where weariness or night come upon me, there I lie down; when I have killed the deer then I eat. I have never thought of a home.' 
               "'Come, then,' said she, sweetly; 'let us seek a spot where we will make a home for ourselves;' and putting her slender hand in his, she led him on until they came to a fountain gushing out from under a high rock, before which a sunny meadow spread itself towards the southwest, blooming with harebells, and daisy-cups, and pansies, and many more wild flowers. 'Is it not charming?' said she; 'the spring shall give us water, and the rock guard us from the fierce north wind, and we can look out upon the sunlight and the shadows as they float mingled together over the green grass and the flowers that spring up through the verdure.' 
               "Sthenos smiled, and though he could not understand all her meaning, he felt a charm of nature he had never before known. 
               "'Now,' she said, 'the sun, though its light be pleasant, looks down too hotly upon us, and when the night comes the dews will fall and the winds chill us. Go, break off boughs from the trees, and strip the broad bark from the decayed birches.' This was an easy task for the vigorous man; and in the meantime she had gathered heaps of dry mosses, and the spicy shoots from the hemlocks, and spread them deeply over the leaf-covered ground. Then leaning the thick boughs against each other, and laying, by her directions, the curved bark, overlapping in successive and continuous layers upon them, Sthenos saw as his work a rude, but safe hut, and said: 'This shall be our home. I go for our evening meal;' and dashing into the forest, he soon returned with wood-pigeons and a young fawn, which he had killed, casting them bleeding at the feet of his gentle wife, who had already arranged in leafy cups the berries which she had gathered from the meadow; and Sthenos beheld wild flowers, mingled with long, trailing, delicate vines, adorning the entrance of their home. 
               "The simple meal soon prepared by her skilful hands, he thought more savory than he had ever had; but before she had suffered him to partake, she pointed upwards, and with clasped hands sang praises to our good God the giver. An hour of delicious friendship stole away, as hand in hand they looked into each other's eyes-thoughts he knew not how to speak, and she needed no words to utter. Then another hymn to our good God, the sleepless Preserver, she warbled from her lips of gurgling melody, and the pair sank to rest. 
               "Thus sped on day after day and night after night. Gradually Sthenos lost his fierceness, save in the struggles of the chase. She had fashioned for him soft garments out of fawn-skins and feathers, which now he wore less from need than pride, and to please his skilful friend. His shaggy hair was smoothed into curling grace; the hut constantly received new conveniences and ornaments from his strong or her cunning hand; and happy was he, after his toils in the forest, to return bearing a rich honeycomb, or leading a goat with full udders to his home, dear because hers. 
               "On waking one dewy morning, he looked fondly in her loving face beaming with tender, holy thoughts, and said: 'You call me Sthenos, but have never told me the name by which I am to call you, my dearest.' 
               "'You have just pronounced the name I love best, except when you call me your wife and your friend. I have had several names in the land whence I came to be near you; but that by which our good God wishes you to know me is Enthymia. And, dear Sthenos, whenever you are in trouble, in need, or in doubt, call Enthymia to your side, and whatever love can do, I will gladly perform. With your strength and my affectionate zeal, and the blessing of our good God, we shall be happy as we may in this wild wood; but the good God has promised me that when you shall have learned to sing and pray with me, that our two beings shall be blended into one, and we shall leave the forest to go and dwell in a garden with our good God, far more beautiful than the one from which you strayed a long while ago.' 
               "'Oh, happy hope,' replied Sthenos, 'I can think of no higher bliss than that your loveliness should be mingled with my strength, except that my strength shall be for ever united to your dear thoughts.' 
               "'Say not so, Sthenos,' answered she, looking up with a holy smile, like morning light sparkling in the dew; 'our highest joy will be to dwell with our good God.' 
               "From that moment Sthenos earnestly endeavored to learn the hymns and prayers of Enthymia. They lived long in the forest, and children were born to them, three sons like their father, vigorous,-three daughters like their mother, graceful. But one fair morning the father and the mother came not from their chamber (for the little hut had given place to a wide dwelling); their children went anxiously in to seek them, but they found them not. Sthenos and Enthymia were gone to the garden of our good God. 
               "The children were mute in wonder and sadness, when suddenly the chamber was filled with ravishing light and delicious odors, and three radiant angels hovered over the bed; and the roof opened, and the children could see far up into the sky, and saw a glorious being standing under the Tree of Life, before the throne of God; and in the smiling countenance of the glorious being they recognized strangely, but sweetly mingled, the love of both father and mother. And one of the angels said (he was the tallest of the three); 'I pointed out the way to them and encouraged them to strive to reach the garden.' 
               "'And I,' said the second, on whose bosom shone a gem like a golden anchor, 'bore them up on my wings.' 
               "'And I,' joyfully exclaimed the third, who had eyes like the first spring violets washed with rain, 'have made them both one for ever.' 
               "Then turning to her sister angels, she said: 'Your tasks for them are over; but I go to fill their united being with immortal happiness.'" 
                
               "Ah! Uncle Bernard," cried Gertrude, "that is better than a fairy tale; but what queer names, Sthenos and Enthymia; what do they mean?" 
               "I made them out of the Greek," answered the old man; "and by Sthenos, I mean man left to himself, when he would be a mere savage; and by Enthymia, I mean wisdom sent to him by our good God, to teach him how to live on earth and prepare for heaven. When man is transformed to holy wisdom and uses his strength for wise ends, he becomes all good, and God takes him up to the second Paradise." 
               "Yes," says little Charley; "and the angel with the anchor, is Hope." 
               "And the tallest angel is Faith," adds Robert; "for faith gives pious people courage." 
               "And the gentle blue-eyed one must be Love, for love lives for ever," whispers Gertrude in Uncle Bernard's ear. 
               "Bless you, dear child, you look like her," whispered back Uncle Bernard. 
             
             
                
               XVII. HOW I CAME TO BE MARRIED. 
               I PROMISED William Hepburne to tell him how I came to be married; and as it was rather an odd way, perhaps it will amuse the public; so here goes! My name is Thomas Petition Stevens; I was born and bred in Connecticut, taught my letters, and the "three Rs, Readin', 'Ritin', and 'Rithmetic," in a district school-house; learned Latin, Greek, and algebra of old Parson Field, and grew tobacco enough on my father's farm, before I was twenty, to help me squeeze through the college course at old Yale. 
               There I found myself one Commencement-day, having delivered the third oration to a blooming audience in the galleries, and a grim crowd below, the happy possessor of a sheepskin, a blue ribbon, a wooden spoon, two dollars and fifty-six cents, and two suits of clothes, one very shabby, and one pie-new. "The world was all before me where to choose," as it says in the primer; and I decided to go up into Colebrook, and see if my maternal uncle, Seth Downes, wanted a man to help get in his rowen. I paid two dollars and fifty cents to get there, and landed on the door-step with nothing but my own personal attractions to recommend me. However, Uncle Downes was as glad to see me as if I had six dollars instead of six cents in my left-hand waistcoat pocket, and hired me for the late haying on the spot, and I set up a singing-school in the red school-house the next Saturday night. When the haying was over, I stayed a few weeks to see what I could turn my hand to, and Uncle Downes, being on the school committee, through his influence I was made principal of Cole-brook Academy when the winter term began, and having a very pretty set of girls to teach, I made myself and my services so acceptable to parents and guardians, that I hold the place to this day, three years from then. 
               One day last spring, I sat on the stoop of Uncle Downes's house, thinking of nothing in a very resolute way, with discursive seasons of listening to a brown thrush that was hid in some neighboring tree, thence giving out all manner of comic illustrations of every other bird's musical powers; hitting off, with gay sarcasm, the robin, oriole, and whip-poorwill; even giving the faint peep of a dew-wet chicken lost in the grass, the warning cry of a hawk, or the lovelorn trill of a song-sparrow, with here and there a pewit, a blackbird, or the liquid frolic of a bobolink's song, mimicked, exaggerated, and interspersed with his own delirious warble, full of spring and its sweet exultation. I was lapsing out of the thrush's concert into nothingness again, when a quick, light patter, like a hail-storm coming down-stairs, woke me up, and at my elbow stood the lithe shape of Lizzy Downes, my special cousin, and a peculiar little bit of womanhood as one might see in a lifetime. "Get tip, Tom!" quoth the green sun-bonnet. "I want you to take a walk with me." I was rather in a quietist state just then, but who ever thought of resisting that clear voice, with such a decisive tone and flawless ring? 
               "Where are you going, Lizzy?" said I, after we had traveled silently and swiftly, like people in fairy stories, half through Uncle Downes's farm. "Oh!" said she, recollecting herself, or rather me, "I'm going to Asa Burt's lot, after some columbine plants, and you may carry the basket." "Gracious princess!" retorted I, "accept my devoirs, and put your foot upon my neck, if it pleases you." "It doesn't," said the princess; "I only want you to behave like a man, and not wait next time for a lady's request, before you offer to help her." At this I whistled slightly, and rubbed my hands; Lizzy had a way of speaking truth that was-well-plain! but she knew it, and turned her rosy face round to me with the divinest smile of intelligence and sweetness. "Don't mind it, Tom; it is all for your good, and you can't get angry with me, you know." Of course I couldn't; such a face as that was talismanic; besides she was my cousin; and it is a singular fact in the natural history of man, that though there are no people on earth one gets so entirely and utterly disgusted and out of temper with as disagreeable and intrusive cousins, it is yet quite out of the nature of things to be disturbed by a young, pretty, smiling cousin, however saucy. It demonstrates most convincingly the old Scotch proverb, "Bluid's thicker than water." All the affinities of ancestry, all the tender associations of childhood, all the nameless sympathies that are only existent between relatives, spring up to harmonize cousins; and our blood beats more warmly towards its severed tide in the pulse of a relation-except, as I said before, the disagreeable ones. So I not only refrained from getting vexed at Lizzy's reproof, but submitted with sweet humility, and would have kissed the rod had it been permitted or required. 
               "Do you hear that thrush, Tom?" broke in the lady, upon my meditation. "Yes, ma'am, I have been listening to it this hour, from the east stoop." "What a lazy creature you are! spending a whole hour in mortal idleness, this lovely day." "Not a bit of it, mademoiselle; my meditations in that stoop were of the most useful character; nothing less than a skilful analysis (mental, of course), of the vibratory power of air, and its probable capabilities in mechanics." "Oh! Tom, Tom! can't you let schoolmastering alone, on Saturdays? and such a celestial Saturday as this; look there, if you want a better meditation than your analyses." 
               I did look up through the dim, gray branches of the wood we were skirting, and there, on the leafless bough of a tall hickory-tree, sat two wild pigeons, eying us with soft, shy glances, stooping their graceful, shining necks, and drawing them up again, with a native pride not unlike that of my companion, though I acquit her of being anything dove-like! A few steps on the dead leaves startled the pretty creatures from their perch, the dull blue plumes shot suddenly into white, and black, and gray, and slowly they lit, some few rods off, on a fir-tree, while we went on our way. 
               "Do you know, Tom," said Lizzy, "I have a theory about birds, and people. I think every one is like some bird. Could you guess, now, who a wood-pigeon always makes me think of?" "I know who has that same way of drawing up her head, Miss Lizzy; no other than your fair self." "Nonsense! I am no more like that pigeon than I am like a turkey; nor as much, for I can gobble inimitably, to the intense rage of all the turkeys in our barn-yard. No, indeed; I am much more like an oriole; look at that one, how it dashes aslant the elm boughs, and makes a descent into the hollow below, like a flake of fire; that's the way I drop into our stupid sewing-societies here, and make the old ladies' hair stand on end with my absurdities. No! if you do not recognize our Colebrook wood-pigeon, I shall not help you." "Then I shall never know," rejoined I, in a tone of mock lamentation. "Oh! yes, you'll discover for yourself, some time," laughed Lizzy, quietly climbing a fence between the home-farm and Uncle Asa's lot. "Why, Lizzy, you are too quick! I was just offering to help you, and you are over." "I never will have any help, sir, over a fence; what is the use of being a country girl, if you cannot cross a fence without help?" "Not much, indeed, in this New England, where every acre field is fenced; but, Lizzy, look! here are columbines enough for you." 
               As I spoke, we had reached the centre of the little meadow through which crept a slow, bright stream, keeping the grass about it greener than the sea, and set thick with blue violets and golden cowslips; while on the drier banks of moss and turf that skirted the marshy borders of the brook, hundreds of sunny adders'-tongues flaunted their yellow turbans, all dropped with garnet, in the spring-winds, and still further back, among budded lupines and sweet fern, myriads of anemones, fair and frail, bent languidly to the warm breath of the south, seeming just ready, so aerial were their shapes, to take flight from their rest upon earth. On the inner edge of the meadow a great gray rock abutted from the hill-side right on to the greensward; about its base clustered a quaint crowd of brown-flowered trilliums, and the delicate straw-bells of May-while on its ledges, from every crack and shelf where a grain of earth could harbor, sprung innumerable columbines of the brightest scarlet and gold, swaying, and dancing, and tossing their jewelled heads like veritable fairy princesses, so full of laughter and delight, that you waited involuntarily to hear the gay peal of musical mirth from their tiny bells, and fancied, on each new sigh of the fragrant air, a far-off echo from their tinkling in some distant field. Here my task began, and in a few minutes Lizzy's basket was filled to the brim with roots, and her hands with the blossoms-fit representatives of her gay, brilliant, graceful self, as she stood poised on a ledge of the rock-her sun-bonnet hanging by one string, her face burning with the warm flush of youth and health, her blue eyes glowing deeply in the sunlight, and her soft chestnut hair coiling in lustrous rings about her throat, lifted by the light wind, and melted to living gold wherever a sunbeam kissed it. 
               I know I stood there with mouth and eyes wide open, like the sun-struck fool I was, "glowering" at Lizzy, who must have had some idea of my condition, for suddenly she began to descend the rock with free, firm steps, like a chamois (at least, I suppose so, vide Buffon), and I remembered afterwards, as one does remember things seen and not perceived, that there was a furtive smile glittering in the corners of her eyes. As for me, I was altogether in a maze, for the idea had suddenly taken possession of me that I was in love, actually, in good earnest, in love with my cousin Lizzy! Everything I had the presence of mind to recollect, favored that idea. Did I not obey her like a bond-slave? was I not always so lonely at Uncle Downes's when she went away? I admired her beauty more than that of any other woman. I admired her mind in its active, earnest, and noble development. 
               Her character had faults, to be sure-a need of some small feminine virtues-but love would teach her those. Ah! did she love me? "Tom! are you asleep?" pealed from the lips of which I had been dreaming. "N-o, Lizzy, I was thinking." "Come a few steps further, then, and I will find you a better place to think, for if you had eyes to see, there is a hornet's nest visible about a foot from your head, in that maple sapling, and you are in what the newspapers call a precarious situation." "So I am!" thought I to myself, adding aloud, "I am bound to follow you, mademoiselle; only lead me." 
               A brief walk over the green field brought us to its upper corner, where the brook leaped and chattered over a stony bed, before it sung itself to sleep in the silent channel below. Over this little nook stood two great apple-trees, rosy with bloom, filling the air with their delicate and peculiar odor, and all murmurous with honey-bees, whose loving labor-song only heightened the cool silence of the shadow and the perfume; while the little brook's laugh toned itself to a bobolink's voice, that echoed its mad mirth back again from the nearest fence-post. "Sit down," said my liege lady; "it is too pleasant here not to be enjoyed." 
               I seated myself on the turf, still in a dream, while Lizzy bathed her hands and face in the cool water, and anchored her flowers to a stone on the edge of the stream to keep them from fading. She came back to me looking as fresh and lovely as the spray of pink apple-blossoms she held in her hand, and, seating herself beside me, began to talk about them. Her entirely unembarrassed air gave me a sort of shiver, but I listened. "Aren't these blossoms very pretty, Tom? There is something specially fascinating to me about 'apple-blows,' as Uncle Asa calls them; they are so refined, so gracious, so home-like; withal softly and warmly tinted, and of such delicate scent, a little bitterness about it; just enough to make it piquant, not insipid; a sort of common-sense, do you understand? And then they are so full of promise for future winter firesides; I have a vision of a whole cider-barrel and ten apple-pies in the very cluster I hold! but really, I am serious about their beauty and expression; my flowers will do well to mate the wild pigeons, won't they?" 
               As she spoke, an oriole flashed across the meadow, and her own comparison for herself made a like flash across my thoughts; how beautiful, how piquant she was! and oh! Thomas Petition Stevens, what a fool you were! dyed in the grain! I lumbered on to my knees before her, I don't remember how, and without one word of warning gasped out:-"Oh, Lizzy! I love you to distraction, can't you love me?" 
               Her face was absolutely pale with surprise, then a wild and flitting fear swept over it; I could see she thought me suddenly crazy, and the hot tears began to fill my eyes, man that I was! I suppose she saw, then, I was in earnest; for she blushed most beautifully, then bent her face down in both her little hands, and began-oh reader! pity me!-actually to laugh:-laugh till the red blush spread to the very parting of her hair, colored the slender throat, the small ear, and at length the white fingers. It was too much; I could not bear it; I became a man again, and something very like a thrill of anger brought me to my feet. At this Lizzy looked up, her eyes full of tears from long laughing, and her face radiant with dimpling mirth, and yet a sweet shadow of pity and surprise upon it. She held out her hand to me-how could I help taking it? or sitting quietly down beside her, very much in the state of a water-cure patient after his first douche? "Dear Tom," she said, in the gentlest, laughter-wearied voice, "do forgive me, but really I could not help it; what does ail you this morning?" "Nothing but what I just told you," said I, in a sulky-dignified manner, that was too much for Lizzy's seriousness; a little shock of laughter shook her again, and brought out new tears, which she wiped away soberly, and clasping her hands over the handkerchief looked round at me with a grave face, through which the comic air still flickered, and discomposed me. "Tom, you are very queer; I cannot believe you really thought you were in earnest!" "But I was," said I, having by this time become disposed to high tragedy; "I love you desperately, devotedly, and if you choose to laugh at the life-long misery of a fellow-being I can only hope you may never know by experience how to sympathize with such misery!" Poor Lizzy! she had to bite her scarlet lips full a minute before she could speak-"Really, Tom, I do not think you know either me or yourself, or you would not have fancied what you seem to have. May I ask how long you have been in this desperate state?" Oh, the little wicked witch! that question was uttered in the simplest, gravest tone, but I felt the satire to its full extent. I grew-all-over-ish-no other phrase expresses it "Why-!" said I, "I did not know it, certainly, till this morning, but I have felt it, unconsciously, this long time." "Tom, Tom, don't be metaphysically absurd! if you must be absurd, keep this side of terms. Now I can tell you something that you have been 'feeling unconsciously this longtime,'-you not only do not love me but you do love somebody else!" I drew a long breath. "Be so good as to explain?" "I mean to," replied Lizzy; "only turn round so I can see you, for I must catechize a little; I never can harangue without interludes for ten minutes together. First, I am to prove you don't love me. You admire me, I dare say, but that is nothing, not even the first step, for you would admire a prettier picture more. When I first knew you, you did not like me; your instincts rebelled against my character; I saw it before I had known you a month; is it not so?" "Do you think that is fair, Lizzy? I did not know you then-I could not judge." "That is not my answer, Tom!" "Well, if you will have it, I confess I felt a little-afraid of you, perhaps; not sure that you might not hurt me any moment." 
               "That will pass, and you may answer my next question to yourself, whether those very instincts have ever ceased to keep a witness among them against me, or my nature as you see it. If I had loved you, I should have lost all these traits towards you; I should have ceased to rule, to criticise, to condemn." 
               An idea struck me at that moment, and I did not look at Lizzy, but I felt her voice was not quite steady when she began again. 
               "If you had loved me, there are a thousand ways in which I should have seen and put an end to it before now. You would never have been so meek, and so easily obedient. A man who loves never loses his sense of domination; if he obeys, it is for beseeching and caresses, for love's sake, not because he recognizes a stronger nature than his own; and you know I am stronger than you in several traits." 
               "Amen," said I, rather satirically. "Now, don't be disagreeable, Tom, I am striving for your good, as Deacon Mather says when he 'tutors' his boys. You don't love me for still another reason, that you never thought of it till this morning. Is that love? born of a spring day's idleness, the fickle caprice of sunshine and the south wind? Nonsense! it is only an apt illustration of Dr. Watts' truism, that 
                      
                        "'Satan finds some mischief still, 
                        For idle hands to do!' 
                     
                  
                
               "Don't wince, for it is a fact. Honestly, now, did you ever think of making love to me when you had anything else to do? I see you can't answer, and that is speech enough. Besides, if you had loved me, you never would have asked me as you did; you would have considered me before yourself, and led me carefully and tenderly towards taking the one all-decisive step of a woman's life." 
               I gave a long sigh; I was becoming convinced, and convinced vinced of something Lizzy did not intend to prove. "Do you acknowledge, Tom?" 
               "Y-e-s, I suppose I must But really, Lizzy, I thought I loved you, and am not sure yet." 
               "I hope you do love me, after a moderate fashion, but you are not in love with me, as I intend to prove to you in the second place, because you are in love with somebody else!" 
               "I am resigned!" said I, inwardly amused at her confident tone, and, be it acknowledged, a little terrified, also; for I began, under her minute questioning, to be partly conscious of-no matter what, yet. 
               "Now, I expect you to be as honest as you have hitherto shown yourself, Tom, for I am going to question more closely than before. You have had dreams-all men and women have-of a home and a future; besides, I know you went not six weeks ago, to look at Deacon Mather's new houses up on the hill. Yes, don't disclaim! I know it was with an eye to your architectural sketches, but did not your dreams come back there? Was there not a figure dimly visible at the long window, a face turning to the gate expectantly, and a pair of neat and busy hands in the 'house wifeskep'? Now, were they nobody's hands?" 
               I began to feel rather restless; how came she to know what I thought? 
               "Moreover, is there no lady among your acquaintances with whom you feel an entire sense of quiet, rest, and freedom; whose entrance into ever so stiff and cold a room gives it a kindly aspect, like the sudden lighting of a wood-fire? No one of whom you think when you are tired, or sad, as a comforting and soothing presence; no eyes to which you turn for sympathy in the expression of thought or feeling, and always find it; no hands from which you expect and receive the thousand nameless acts of forethought and consideration that only love prompts?" 
               I had thought to some purpose, and was half convicted, but not fully enough to say so. "Go on Lizzy! I like to hear you," said I, affecting an incredulous laugh. 
               "You are not honest," replied my catechist; "your laugh was in a false key; it betrays you; but I will go on. Is there not one person whom you feel a constant wish to shelter from all the hardness of life, to protect, to guard, to strengthen? whose image connects itself in some way with every aspect of the future, without whose ever-recurring idea neither present nor future enter into your imagining? in whom you unconsciously hope? Moreover, is there no one whom your heart tells you with undeniable instinct, loves you as a man should be loved-with entire devotion and pure tenderness, a patient faith and a sorrowful constancy, that you rely on without acknowledging it? Do you not trust her as you did your mother? Is she not a part of yourself so truly, that, till some sudden light should awaken you, you could not perceive you loved her? Are not her soft, dark eyes-" 
               "They're not dark! they are gray." Now Lizzy laughed indeed, and I too. The sly girl! I was quite in her power. 
               "My dear Tom, do you suppose I have not known this three months that you were very quietly sliding (not falling) in love with Helen Stanton? Of course I saw it, and so did half the village. As for your exploit this morning, I think I have fully accounted for that; and now, having shown you to yourself, and brought you to confession, do you forgive my laughter? I own it was all unkind, but how could I help it?" 
               "I don't need to forgive you, Lizzy," said I. "You have done me a great service. I wonder at myself." 
                
               "Don't wonder, but act, Tom. I had no authority to say what I did about Helen's liking you, but my own observation, and I am by no means infallible. I shall not laugh if she rejects you, I assure you." 
               This suggestion made me thoroughly unquiet, I could no longer repress an impertinence I had been trying to utter for the last fifteen minutes. "We shall see," said I, assuming a miserable caricature of confidence. "And, by the way, Lizzy, how came you to be so well read in the statistics of the tender passion, as you have shown yourself?" I accompanied the question with a malicious stare at Lizzy, whose face was instantly double-dyed with crimson, and her hands working relentless destruction with the bough of apple-blossoms. 
               "Why-to be honest-I don't-oh! I meant Helen, by the wild pigeon, Tom." 
               "Yes, I know you did; but I am not to be blinded by that flash of the oriole. Where did your knowledge come from, Lizzy?" 
               "Oh!-you see-dear me! how silly I am! Tom, I am going to be married to George Stanton, and that is what I brought you out here to tell you, and then wasted two mortal hours telling you that you were in love with his sister! It is too absurd!" 
               Lizzy's word's came like rockets, and her face drooped in her hands, as she finished-no-in one hand, for I had taken the other, and absolutely was kissing it, I was so very glad. George Stanton was the finest fellow in the county, fully worthy of Lizzy, had just finished his theological course, and was to be installed in Colebrook next month. It was exactly the best thing, and, as soon as I found words, I told her so, adding, somewhat ruefully: "I hardly expected to be congratulating you on this subject, two hours ago; but I am sincerely glad, Lizzy." 
                
               She looked up, with a little, sweet laugh, and thanked me; so, rising from the turf, we gathered up the basket and the columbines, and threaded our way homeward through the woods, silently enough. 
               That night I went down to Mr. Stanton's and persuaded Helen to go to singing-school with me. I don't know if they had the class without the master, or not. I never asked; for, instead of being in the red school-house, Helen and I were sitting on a pine log, by the edge of the river, in the moonlight; and, after a great many devices of speech, I had at last managed to ask her the same question I put to Lizzy in the morning, only in rather a different way, and much more uneasily. 
               She, too, hid her face, but tears came dropping through the slender fingers; and she did not forbid me to take away the hands, or dry the tears, but looked up at me with her clear eyes, so full of unutterable love, that they seemed to have grown blue, instead of gray, and said, softly: "I wonder what I have ever done, to be made so happy!" Well for me that I felt, with no slight heartache, what the tender humility of her speech implied, though she did not know it herself. If I could not now efface the past, I would try faithfully to make her future blessed. 
               We were married last autumn. First old Father Mather married George and Lizzy; then George did the same kind office for Helen and me. My wild pigeon still keeps that name; and Lizzy and I have once in a while a little clash that Helen cannot understand. Only yesterday, when I asked Mrs. Stanton to admire the comfortable arrangements of my new house (one of Deacon Mather's), she informed me she "could not sympathize with the life-long misery of a fellow-creature!" I had to laugh, in spite of myself. 
               That, patient reader, is the way I came to be married.
