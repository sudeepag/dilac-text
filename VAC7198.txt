                           MY DEAR FRIEND:
                         
                        According to promise, I have read "Sartaroe," and now will give you my opinion of the book in a word. It is highly creditable to your genius. It is excellent; all in all, the best novel issued from the American press for some years past. It must certainly meet with success. I will do my best for you. You ought to clear, at least, $4,000 or $5,000 by it. I have written to Murray, of London, my old publisher, at I told you I would, and I have advised him to reprint the book there, and have assured him that he ought to send the Author 200 sterling for the privilege of printing the work in England. You may use this when the book comes out. 
                        
                           With the greatest esteem, 
                           I am your Friend, 
                           WASHINGTON IRVING.

            The field upon which the Author has now tried his pen, is one which, notwithstanding it abounds in romance, and is fertile in natural beauty, has rarely engaged the attention of the writer of fiction. The scenes and plot are laid in Norway and the United States, alternately and the main, incident of the tale is one of engrossing interest, viz.: the courage and devotion of a young Norwegian peasant girl, who saved her lover (a guide falsely accused of the murder of a traveler) from ignominious punishment, by voluntarily, and unknown to her friends, undertaking a perilous journey to the Hardanger Field Mountain Range, and bringing the supposed murdered man-who had fallen from a precipice-into Court, at the moment of the Judge was pronouncing sentence. This is a story-elaborated-often related with pride by the people of Bergen, the ancient capital of Norway. 
            The Author has traveled over the part of Norway which he has endeavored to describe, viz.: from Bergen to Christiansund, near the Arctic Circle, and has witnessed the majestic scenery, and talked with the simple and interesting people of that country; consequently, there is a freshness in the narrative portions of the book which otherwise could not have existed. 
            Other incidents, worked into the plot, and adding to the interest of the tale-having relation to the United States and the Norwegian Colony in Wisconsin-keep the attention of the reader earnestly engrossed to the end; but these we can merely allude to in the compass of a brief circular. 
            We have every expectation, from our knowledge of the popularity of the Author, that this, decidedly the most elaborate and interesting of his books, will meet with great success. 
            Copies of either edition of "SARTAROE" will be sent to any person, to any part of the United States, free of postage, on their remitting the price of the edition they may wish, to the publishers, in a letter post-paid.

            PREFACE. 
            THE chief incidents of the following tale have been suggested by the recollections of a tour on the western coast of Norway, undertaken by the author several years ago. The loss of a vessel off the Island of Sartaroe, opposite Bergen, while the author was in that city, and the saving of the life of one man, only, out of the passengers and crew on board, under circumstances nearly the same as those narrated, provided a hero for the story, and a well-known (in Norway) Norsk legend suggested the catastrophe upon which the plot hinges. 
            Of late years Norway has been widely explored by tourists, and the gloomy but magnificent beauty of its scenery is better known and appreciated now than it was even ten years ago; yet, although the country abounds in matter of romantic interest to the poet, artist, and romancist, it has seldom occupied the attention of the writer of fiction. 
            If any reader object to an incident described in the latter portion of the story, which he may deem improbable, the author begs to assure him that to his knowledge a similar case occurred, and there are several others on record. He does not pretend to explain the cause either theoretically or philosophically. He can only say to the doubter, in the language of Hamlet, "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy." There are facts occurring every day which neither the greatest master, nor the most fertile inventor of fiction dare to put on paper, lest he be charged with extravagance and absurdity. 
            The author has been indebted for the beautiful though somewhat free translations of portions of Norwegian national and drinking songs to the pen of Miss Pardoe; but the descriptions of Norwegian scenery, though he is aware that they must fail to convey any idea of the wild and savage grandeur of this portion of the earth, are drawn from his own recollections, and the deep impressions, never to be obliterated, which that scenery made upon his mind.

               CHAPTER I. 
               THE MAID OF THE LIGHT-HOUSE. 
               THE western coast of Norway, from the Naze, its southwestern extremity, to the bleak North Cape, is defended by a rocky rampart of larger and smaller islands of all dimensions, from a mere point to a mile or more in length, and lying for the most part within an English mile of the mainland, forming, as it were, an outer coast, within which all boats and small vessels make their coasting voyages; for, even when the sea without is strongly agitated, one may sail many miles through the channel in water as smooth as a mill-pond, and sheltered from the fury of the wind, save when passing the openings between one rock and another, when it is necessary to be cautious in lowering the sails. A few of these islands are from ten to twenty miles in length, and are not destitute of vegetation; but most of them are so small that they are inhabited only by some fishermen or pilots, who keep a few head of cattle, which they send for pasture to the neighboring little islands, rocks, and skerries. The outer surface of these rocky islands is dreadfully shattered by the impetuous billows of the great Northern Ocean, which rolls its vast watery mountains on the craggy shores, dashing and foaming over the skiers or skerries, until it meets a proud defiance from the frowning and majestic bulwarks of granite which form the barrier of the, country. The skerries are stupendous natural columns of stone, which by thousands encompass the coast; and, though varying in their extent, form, and distance, all rise perpendicularly through water from one to three hundred fathoms deep. Of these, in numerous instances, the summits are only marked by the spray dashing over their heads, or seen occasionally in the hollow of an immense wave, presenting to the view a black and shapeless mass. It has been calculated that there are a million of these gigantic forms round the coast of Norway. 
               Distant from the mainland about three miles, and forming a natural and impervious breakwater to the harbor and port of Bergen, lies the island of Sartaroe, and on its southern extremity is situated one of the numerous light-houses which stud this natural barrier of the Norwegian coast. 
               The proximity of Sartaroe to the capital city of Bergen, makes the narrow channel between the island and the mainland a busy thoroughfare during the few months of summer. Norwegian coasting vessels, and fishing smacks, and market boats of all sizes, dot its usually unruffled surface, while merchant vessels of larger dimensions, under the flags of Russia, Sweden, Prussia, England, Holland, Belgium, France, Spain, and Naples, give additional life and variety to the scene. 
               But this scene of activity is but of short duration. The season, commencing late in spring, closes early in autumn, and during the long dreary months of winter only an occasional fishing boat, struggling along under a single lug-sail against the half frozen current, breaks the dreary monotony of the channel. 
               There is a fishing village, if such, a small cluster of humble cabins can be called, situated on the inner coast of the island, and at about midway its length, and here and there throughout its surface stand solitary cottages, inhabited by fishermen and pilots; but on the barren promontory, on which the light-house is erected, there is no other dwelling but the cabin occupied by the keeper and his family. 
               At the period to which our story relates, the keeper of the light-house was one Christian Jansen, whose family consisted of his wife, his nephew, Carl Jansen, a man of about thirty-five, and Louise Sigvald, a young girl of eighteen or twenty years of age. Christian Jansen and his wife Margaret had both seen their seventieth birth-day, yet were still hale and hearty, save that they suffered from occasional attacks of rheumatism, which at times disabled them. Carl was a pilot by profession, and of course often absent from home during the summer season; and, consequently, when these periodical attacks of rheumatism confined the old people to their comfortable seats in the chimney corner, the duties of the light-house, as well as those of the little household itself, devolved upon Louise. 
               Louise Sigvald was generally supposed to be the grand-daughter of old Christian Jansen. It was known that Christian had in his younger days followed the profession of a pilot, and that he had a daughter who had married a brother pilot, bearing the name of Sigvald. This brave fellow had perished some twenty years before in the endeavor to save the crew of a ship which had come ashore near the Naze, and his wife, who was confined at the time, had received such a shock on hearing of her gallant husband's death, that she died after having given birth to a female child. At all events, Louise Sigvald always called the old people by the familiar and endearing appellations of grandfather and grandmother. 
               Some fifteen years before the period at which our story opens, Christian Jansen quitted his arduous profession, and had been appointed to the keepership of the Sartaroe light-house, and he had brought Louise, then a child of four or five years old, with him to the island. 
               Yet there was little in the appearance of the young girl which would have led strangers to suppose that she was connected by the ties of kindred with old Jansen and his wife. Her delicate beauty was a source of marvel, even when a child, to the rude fishermen and their families, among whom her lot was cast, and as she grew older there was much jealousy among the young fishermen of the island, and even among the young burghers of the mainland, to which the fame of her beauty had extended, as to who should win the favor of the fair grand-daughter of the light-house keeper. 
                
               Christian Jansen had been a handsome man in his younger days, but his good looks had consisted in his bold and manly features and his athletic frame and stout sinewy limbs. He had been the beau ideal of a stout Norse sailor, and as such had won the heart of Margaret Brant, his wife, herself, then, the type of a healthy, good-tempered Scandinavian maiden; but Margaret had possessed no claims to the delicate beauty of feature and form which characterized her grand-daughter Louise; neither had the daughter of this worthy pair, nor the gallant sailor whom she had wedded, and it was thought to be a strange thing by the gossips that a maiden so fair as Louise should have sprung from such a sturdy stock. 
               Still, if the city of Bergen itself could not boast of a fairer flower than Louise among its gayest and loveliest belles, there was not among the daughters of the rude fishermen of Sartaroe, nor among those of the adjacent islands and mainland, a blither, a more good-tempered, nor a harder-working maiden. If Louise had a fault, it was that she possessed a slight tendency to coquetry; and this was quite natural, when it is taken into consideration that there was not a young pilot or fisherman for miles around who was not ready at any moment to do her any service, or to dare any adventurous deed, to gain a smile from her lips. 
               It was a sight worth seeing to watch Louise as she bustled about the house in the early morning, singing merrily the while, and sparing her aged grandmother almost every household care, or milking the solitary cow, which knew her voice and followed her like a dog, rubbing her great hairy head against the smooth fair cheek of the maiden, who laughed and patted the neck of the animal, as she often vainly strove to avoid the rude caress. Then there was the milk to set in the humble dairy, and the cabin to put in order, and the bright pewter dishes-the glory of a Norwegian cottager-to reburnish and rearrange against the walls, and the few cherished ornaments of English crockery to dust, and polish, and replace on the mantel-shelf in the most tasteful array, and by-and-bye the butter to churn, and the simple meals to cook, and, after dinner, if old Christian's limbs were stiff, or if he was suffering with rheumatic pains and Carl was absent, the light-house lamps to clean and trim, and then-great event of the day, whether it be with city belle or village maid, whether with the daughter of wealth and luxury or she of humble birth and scanty means-there was the pleasing task of dressing for the evening, when Erik Lodbrok, the pilot's handsome son, who lived in the village, or Hans Petersen, the fisherman's equally handsome boy, who resided in a cabin not far distant from the point on which the light-house stood, or Rolf Frode, or any other of Louise's admirers might call in to spend an hour, for the cabin of the light-house keeper received more company than any other cottage on the island, and Louise was the magnet of attraction which drew the young men of Sartaroe thither. 
               It took much time to arrange even the simple dress common to the feminine portion of the Norwegian peasantry to the satisfaction of the fair wearer, and the time Louise spent before the one small, cracked looking-glass which the cabin boasted, often led to remonstrances on the part of good old mother Jansen, who once had begged the pastor, who paid occasional visits to the island, to speak to her on the subject; but she had listened to the kind-hearted old clergyman so meekly, and had defended herself so prettily, and pleaded in excuse the neatness of every thing in the house-the work of her own busy hands-and the necessity and propriety of neatness in her own person too, that the pastor could not find it in his heart to chide her, and as old Christian always took her part, whatever she did, Louise still continued to claim the privilege of devoting her own time to personal adornment, after all the household duties were fulfilled; and it was really astonishing how long it took to don the short scarlet jacket of homespun stuff-Louise's own manufacture-and the full short petticoat, and to draw the creases out from the snow-white stockings till they set as tightly to the taper limbs as the skin itself; and then the arrangement of the gay colored handkerchief in such a manner that it should not conceal the luxuriant curls of flaxen hair, and the tying of the sash which bound the slender waist, all these arrangements did really occupy a very long time; but when the task was accomplished, no pier glass in the parlor of the wealthiest burgher in Bergen reflected a more compact, graceful little figure, nor a fairer face, nor more beautiful blue eyes, nor a sweeter mouth, nor plumper, rosier, more dimpled cheeks, than did the old cracked looking-glass fixed upon the oaken chest of drawers in the humble cabin of the light-house keeper of Sartaroe, despite the coarse material, and, in the eyes of the daughters of fashion, the grotesque style of the apparel. No wonder that Erik Lodbrook and Hans Petersen sought so eagerly for a kind word and a smile from those pretty lips, or for a favoring glance from those bright blue eyes, and were so jealous of each other, that when they quitted the keeper's cottage together, as they often did after spending the evening in the company of Louise, each suspecting that the other had received the most marks of favor from the fair object of their mutual admiration, they often wished separately and secretly that something would happen which would prevent the other from visiting Louise again. 
               And then, before the family retired for the night, it was delightful to listen to Louise as she read a chapter from the old well-worn Danish Bible, in a clear, sweet, musical voice, indicative of the childish innocence and purity of her heart, and concluded the simple evening service with repeating on her knees-the old people kneeling with her-a prayer from an equally old and well-worn Danish Lutheran prayer book. 
               After which, having embraced the old couple-it was well that Hans and Erik were not by to witness the embrace they could not share-the fair girl retired to her bed. Thus, with little variation from day to day, from year to year, passed away the youthful life of Louise on the island of Sartaroe. 
               The winter season is, throughout Norway, as it is in most cold climates, the season of pleasure and enjoyment. During the short summer all must work; and, indeed, travel to any distance is easier in winter than in any other season of the year, excepting, perhaps, during a few weeks of midsummer. In the spring and early summer, the melting of the ice and snow renders the roads dangerous and often impassable, and in autumn the dense fogs and heavy rains make traveling equally impracticable; but in winter, when the entire surface of the country is covered with pure white snow, glittering like a diamond desert in the sunshine, over which the sledges glide with lightning speed, the small, hardy Norwegian horses emulating each other, seeming to enjoy the race equally with the riders, and striving which can fly the fastest over the frozen ground, nothing can be more exhilarating than the travel from one hamlet to another to exchange visits of friendship and to renew old acquaintanceship; for it often happens that neighbors, living but a few miles apart, do not see each other from the breaking up of one winter until the frosts of the ensuing one have again bound the earth in adamantine fetters. 
               The winter season had passed away, and its hospitable parties, and its simple but healthy enjoyments were but subjects of pleasing retrospection and conversation, and the warm sun of May had broken up the frost and melted the snow, and the island and the whole adjacent country was covered with winter. It was unsafe, almost impossible, to journey from one she scattered cabins to another after nightfall, save to those who were perfectly acquainted with the hidden track. The fishermen of the island were all occupied night and day in their toilsome duties; and most of the pilots had begun to find employment on board the foreign vessels which now nearly every day made their appearance from the headlands, steering toward the port of Bergen. 
               It was growing late in the afternoon, and Louise had got through her household tasks, and had trimmed the light-house lamps-for Carl was away at sea, and old Christian was laid up with rheumatism-and was now putting the last fanciful touch to a new piece of head gear which Hans Petersen had bought when last in Bergen, and presented her with as a birth-day gift. 
               She stood before the glass innocently admiring the effect of the dark colors in contrast with her fair hair. Having satisfied herself that she was as neat and smart as it was possible for her skillful fingers to make her, she turned away toward the window and looked abroad; but the bleak, watery landscape did not seem to claim much of her attention. She smiled, then looked grave, then muttered something to herself absently, pulling to pieces the while a bunch of fern leaves which stood in a vase on the window sill. It was very evident that something more serious than usual occupied the mind of the maiden. 
               Old Christian and his wife observed the change in her usually placid demeanor. They were seated by the fire, for the air was still damp and chilly. "Louise!" exclaimed mother Jansen, "I declare you are pulling to pieces that beautiful bunch of ferns that Rolf brought last time he called, and scattering them upon the floor which you swept and sanded afresh only an hour ago; yesterday, you admired them so much." 
               "Something ails the child," said old Christian. "What is it, darling? You have not been like yourself this week past. Sometimes laughing, and sometimes seemingly almost ready to cry, and all about nothing, that I can make out. Are you not well?" 
               "Yes, quite well, grandfather, quite well," replied the young girl, blushing crimson, as if she had been caught in some disgraceful act, and pulling at the bunch of fern leaves more violently than before. Suddenly she smiled, as if at her own confusion, and stooping down, gathered up the scattered leaves, saying as she rose again: 
               "This room is so close. I will go out awhile, and see how the garden looks." 
               The garden was a small patch of sandy soil, rudely inclosed in wooden railings, in which the light-house keeper cultivated a few vegetables for the use of the family, and in which were also a few hardy flowers, the special objects of Louise's attention. But, on this occasion, the young girl appeared to be bent on destruction. She plucked a bunch of crocuses, which had but that morning bloomed, and the cherished flowers soon shared the fate of the unlucky fern leaves. Brindle, the cow, came lowing toward her, and poked her head over the railings, as if to invite her mistress's attention, but in vain. Presently she walked out beyond the garden, to the edge of the cliff, and gazed vacantly at the sea, and then seated herself upon a rude bench near by, which the light-house keeper had erected. 
               "I wonder whether Rolf Frode will come to-night," she muttered to herself, "and if he does, whether he will ask me to marry him, too, as Hans and Erik have both done. He wanted to tell me something last time he called, I know. I don't want to get married; and I 'm sure I can't leave grandfather and grandmother, now they 're growing old; and yet I don't like to disappoint Hans, nor Erik, nor yet Rolf. Still, I can't marry them all; and if I could, they could not all live in the light-house. Let me think," she continued to soliloquize, after a pause, "which do I like best, or do I really like any of them well enough to marry them? Hans Petersen never goes to Bergen without bringing me home some present, and he is very good to his mother and to the widow Katrina, whose husband was drowned last year; but then he is so passionate when he is vexed, that it is quite terrible to see him. I should be afraid to become the wife of Hans. Erik Lodbrook is handsomer than Hans, and always good-tempered; but then he is lazy, and some folks say he is a coward. He refused to go out last autumn to the rescue of the crew of the brig which struck on the rocks on the north end of the island, until he was compelled to go for very shame. I don't think he is a coward; but he doesn't like to trouble himself about any thing. I have seen him brave enough sometimes. Oh, no! I could n't marry a lazy husband! Then there is poor Rolf Frode. I do believe he loves me more than either of the others; but he is so bashful; he never talks to me when he calls, only sits talking to grandfather and grandmother, and, when he thinks I am not looking, casting his great blue eyes at me. He is very kind to his widowed sister and her children, Rolf Frode, badly off as he is himself, poor fellow! I am so sorry for him since he lost his fishing boat last summer. He has been striving all the year to save money enough to buy another one, but I fear has been unable to do so. Rolf Frode is too poor to get married; and yet what matters that, if he's good and honest; and his poverty's not his own fault, poor fellow! Still, I should feel very sad to marry any one, and so disappoint the others. Hans asked me first, too, and Rolf has n't asked me at all yet; but I know he means to, some day. Oh! why do they bother me so, when they know I can't marry them all?" 
               From the tenor of this soliloquy, it may be inferred that two of the most importunate of Louise's lovers had taken some favorable opportunity during the winter to tell their tale of love and to ask the maiden's hand; furthermore, that she had a secret partiality for Rolf Frode, the poorest of her admirers; and still further, that she scarcely knew the meaning of marriage, and liked all the young men as friends and companions, rather than loved any one of them. 
               It began to grow dusk, and Louise, rousing herself from a reverie into which she had fallen, rose from her seat to return to the cabin. She cast her gaze abroad across the wide expanse of ocean visible from the rocky ledge on which she stood. 
               It was a grim rock, frowning over the toiling ocean, above which it towered to the height of three or four hundred feet. Its extreme point overhung its base, which was indented and caverned by the ceaseless assaults of the waves, which, even in the calmest weather, surged against it with a roar like thunder, as if mad with impotent fury; dashing their spray half-way up the cliff, and in times of storm and tempest, casting the salt shower to the very summit, upon which it fell like rain. Myriads of sea-fowl built their nests in the fissures of the rock, and made the air vocal with their discordant screams, and these were now returning home from seaward. 
               Something in the aspect of the sea or sky attracted the attention of the maiden to the immediate exclusion of the harassing thoughts which had lately occupied her mind. She gazed long and earnestly into the distant horizon, and placed her hand to her ear, as if to shut out the roar of the surging waters below, the better to listen to some distant and more ominous sound. Then she advanced to the extreme edge of the precipice and peered down into the dark depths of the boiling waters beneath. One false step, one moment of giddiness would have sent her over the steep into the sea, which was a hundred fathoms deep close to the cliff. It was a fearful daring, or would have appeared so to the unaccustomed eye of a stranger, but the nerves of the maiden trained from childhood to string themselves more firmly, the greater the seeming peril in which she was placed, quailed not. A thousand times before she had stood on the same dizzy height gazing wonderingly into the ocean, half-amused, half-awe stricken, as her imagination peopled its depths with the mermen and mermaids, and the krakens and sea serpents, which the wild legends of the country told were the inhabitants of the fathomless deep. 
               The sea was still calm beyond the surge; but a well was setting in, landward, which already increased the volume of water which washed the base of the precipice, and the spray occasionally flew so high as to blind the eyes of the maiden. Notwithstanding the thundering of the surge against the sides and among the caverns of the rock, and despite the splashing sound of the spray, a practiced ear could hear a low murmuring sound, seeming to approach from the far distance, and to utter a warning as it drew near. It was to this the maiden was listening. The sky had not yet become clouded; but a heavy lead-colored bank loomed up in the horizon, streaked with weather-galls of faded red and purple; and this lead-colored bank rose so rapidly as to threaten soon to obscure the entire vault of heaven. An occasional catspaw of wind ruffled here and there the smooth, yet heaving billows, as if the tempest were playfully toying with the waters which it was about to lash into fury. The sea-fowl were flying low, swiftly, and in silence, a sure sign of a coming storm; and the fishermen who had been tempted, by the fineness of the weather, to pursue their occupations outside the line of rocky islets and skerries, had observed the warning signs of the elements, and were steering their barks toward the small harbor on the southern shore of the island. 
               Louise had stood so long gazing at these ominous signs that darkness had nearly set in, when she was reminded of the necessity of hastening under shelter by the falling of large drops of rain, the certain precursors of a violent tempest. She cast one more hurried glance into the distant horizon, and then uttering the words. 
               "Thank God, there is not a solitary ship to be seen!" tripped back to the cabin of the light-house. 
               Glancing her gaze upward, she saw that the lanterns had not yet been lighted, and accusing herself of negligence, she ran hastily up the steps of the tower as soon as she crossed the threshold of the cabin, scarcely replying to the anxious inquiries of old Christian and Margaret, as to what had detained her abroad so long, when it was evident a storm was brewing. 
               The darkness had come on apace. It was black as midnight all around, before she had lighted the lanterns; but this duty completed, her thoughts reverted to the fishing-boats which she had seen heading toward the land. She advanced to the railings of the gallery which surrounded the turret in which the lanterns were placed, and looked down upon the sea. The wind had begun to rise, and the waters were already covered with foam, and the rain was falling heavily. The sky overhead was now completely obscured by a lead-colored canopy, and all was wrapped in impenetrable darkness, save where the reflection of the lanterns gleamed upon the water immediately at the base of the cliffs, and when a faint flash of lightning glared, and momentarily lighted up the horizon. The fishing-boats had already gained the shelter of the rocks, and most of them were anchored within the little inlet which formed the harbor of Sartaroe; so her anxiety was relieved on this score, and she was about to descend, when her attention was drawn to a strange light, gleaming in the far distance. Another light, and yet another, and then a booming sound was borne across the waters which differed widely from the roar and rattle of the now frequent claps of thunder. 
               She well knew whence this sound and these lights proceeded. They came from a ship which was making signals for a pilot, although the weather was so threatening that no pilot would venture to put to sea. Again all was darkness, and then, again, came the boom of another gun, and three or four lights were displayed in rapid succession. She seized the night-telescope, and leveling it in the direction whence she had seen the lights, waited anxiously until they should reappear; but at this moment a vivid flash of lightning, followed by a heavy crash of thunder, illumined the horizon with its lurid glare. From the height on which she stood she was enabled, by the aid of the night-glass, to catch a glimpse of the object she sought. It was a ship bearing directly down upon an almost sunken range of skerries, which lay to the southward of the island, and already in dangerous proximity to them. The crew could not have seen the land before darkness and the storm set in together, and they must either not have discerned the light, or have mistaken it for a star, or have missed their reckoning, for they were still steering right before the gale to certain destruction. 
               The maiden stood pale and trembling with affright, the night-glass still in her hands, and still leveled in the direction of the ship. Ten minutes of fearful anxiety passed by, during which she stood as if transfixed to the spot, still peering through the glass. A frightful gust of wind arose which shoot even the solid light-house to its foundation, and the squall had scarcely spent its fury when a vivid flash of lightning again illumined the darkness. It was blinding in its brilliancy, and the clap of thunder which immediately, followed it, crashing, roaring, and tearing as if heaven and earth were rending asunder, told how fearfully near was the electrical current; but Louise heeded not this: her attention was wholly engrossed by the vessel hurrying blindly on to destruction. Again she caught a glimpse of it. She was familiar with the changeful appearance, at least, of nautical tactics. The crew had discovered their dangerous proximity to the half-sunken skerries, and had, in all probability, discerned the light. 
               They had hauled the vessel to the wind just as the squall must have struck them, and thus narrowly missed striking the northern ledge of the skerries; but in the performance of this maneuver, the topgallant-mast had been carried away, and the wreck entangled the rigging. The ship had drifted inshore so rapidly before the gale, ere the crew had become fully aware of their danger, and was now so near, that Louise could discern the broken spars, with the aid of the powerful telescope. The crew were now endeavoring to keep the vessel's head off shore: but this, owing to her disabled condition and the violence of the wind and the high sea, setting dead on shore, was impossible. Their utmost efforts could only serve to delay, for a little while, the moment of their destruction. They had cleared the northern ledge of the skerries, only to find themselves drifting down upon the darkly-frowning cliffs of Sartaroe island. The gun was silent: the crew had other work now on hand and could not spare time to load and fire it; but blue-lights were thrown up incessantly, only serving to point out to the terrified girl-the only witness of their peril-the position of the ship, growing every moment more imminently perilous. To save the vessel Louise knew was hopeless, unless a miracle were to be performed; but it might still be possible to save at least a portion of the crew. A sudden resolution was formed. She flung the telescope aside and flew rapidly down the spiral staircase of the tower. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER II. 
               THE JOURNEY TO THE CABIN OF ROLF FRODE. 
               "WHY, Louise, what ails thee, lass?" exclaimed old Christian, as the maiden re-entered the kitchen of the cabin in which the family usually sat, excepting on Sundays and holidays. "Thou art not wont to be affrighted by a tempest of wind and rain, although, to tell the truth, this threatens to be one of the hardest. Surely," he continued, addressing his wife; "surely, mother, the lass is ill. All day, ay, and for days past, she has been acting strangely, and now see how the ascent and descent of the tower stairs has paled her cheek and caused her to pant for breath! O! that nephew Carl, was at home; or that this cursed rheumatism had chosen some other time to assail my old limbs, that I might spare my brave, pretty lass some of her labors. Thou must rest thyself, Louise," he added, again addressing the maiden. "Thou must hie thee to thy bed early to-night, and let the wind lull thee to sleep; and to-morrow I will try and get one of the fisher lads to stay here till Carl returns, and so relieve thee of this light-house duty." 
               "I am not ill, grandfather," replied Louise. "It is not that; but I have seen a terrible sight from the gallery of the tower. Grandfather, there is a disabled vessel inside the skerries, drifting down upon the island, and making signals for aid from the shore, in vain. Something must be done, and that speedily, or every soul on board will be lost." 
               "A ship, disabled, and inside the skerries, and in this gale, too!" exclaimed the old light-house keeper. "Nay, then, it is vain to hope to succor the crew. It is God's will, lass; I have seen but two vessels in such peril, and not a man of the crew of either, lived to tell the story of the mishap." 
               "We must do our best, grandfather," rejoined Louise. "It is sinful, cruel, to remain inactive when our fellow-creatures are about to perish so near us." 
               "What can we do?" said the keeper. 
               "We must procure aid from the village or from the fishermen nearer by. O that Rolf had come before the storm came on. We can not expect him to-night." 
               "To-night, lass!" exclaimed old Christian; "nay, no one under shelter will leave his home, on such a night as this threatens to be. Listen to the thunder! Hark! how the wind blows; and the roar of the waters is heard above all. These spring storms are always terrible in their fury." 
               Margaret Jansen had not spoken a word; but sat rocking to and fro in her chair, with her hands clasped, her lips moving, as if engaged in silent prayer. 
               Meanwhile Louise had brought her flannel cloak from the closet and thrown it around her, unobserved by her grandfather and grandmother, and was engaged in drawing on a pair of double lined reindeer-hide boots, such as are worn alike by the men and women of Norway, in winter or bad weather. 
               Margaret Jansen raised her head at this moment, and observing how Louise was engaged, uttered an exclamation of surprise, which drew the attention of the keeper to the maiden. 
               "In the name of heaven, what art thou going to do, lass?" he exclaimed. 
               "I am going to seek assistance for the hapless crew of the vessel now drifting ashore," calmly replied Louise. 
               "Girl," exclaimed her grandfather, "this is folly, madness! The waters are out and the roads are impassable. A stout man could not keep the track, amid the darkness and in such a storm as this. You will be blown over the precipice or swept away by the torrents. Stay where you are; you can not aid the devoted crew of this unfortunate ship. It is their fate, and they must meet it; besides, before you can obtain assistance, even if it were practicable, it will be too late; perhaps it is too late now." 
               "Nevertheless I will try," replied Louise. "Grandfather, if only one be saved, through my means, I shall be amply rewarded. If none are saved my conscience would never be at peace again, if I had left them to perish without making an effort to save tham. I will go. God will guide and protect me." 
               To the utter astonishment of the light-house keeper, his wife rose from her seat, and limping toward her grand-daughter, laid her hand upon her head, and said, 
               "Go, my child; and the God of storms and tempests be with you and direct your footsteps." 
               "By heaven! mother," exclaimed Christian, petrified with astonishment at the action and words of his wife, "you are as mad as she. I tell you that the stoutest and boldest man on the island would not venture to face this storm, unless driven to it by necessity. Even now, the ship may have struck against the rocks and all on board may have perished." 
               "Some may be saved," replied Louise, "even if the ship has gone to the bottom. Do you forget the story so often told, how, twenty years ago, two fishermen whose boat was dashed to pieces in such a storm as this, were washed upon a ledge of rock, from which they scrambled into one of the caverns in the side of the cliff, where they remained two days, and until the storm had abated, when they were rescued by means of ropes let down from above?" 
               "It is an idle legend," said Christian. "For fifteen years I have been keeper of this light-house, and during that time, two ships have been dashed to pieces against the rocks, in sight of all the people on the island; ay, in broad daylight, girl. The vessels were split asunder; some portions of the cargoes floated and were afterward picked up by the fishermen; but none, no, not one man of the crews was ever seen." 
                
               "Still I will go," calmly replied Louise. 
               "Since thou wilt be so obstinate," replied Christian, "I can not prevent thee; but first help me to mount the steps of the tower. We shall at least be able to see from the gallery whether the ship still floats or not, and if she does, to judge whether there be any hope of her weathering the gale." 
               The conversation between Louise and the old light-house keeper had occupied less time than we have taken to relate it. Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed from the time Louise had flung aside the spyglass and quitted the gallery, until she stood cloaked and booted, and prepared to risk the hazardous attempt she had resolved upon. She was herself anxious to discern, if possible, before she started on her journey, the position of the vessel, and she again ascended the steps of the tower, her grandfather leaning upon her shoulder. It was no light task to Louise to bear the partial weight of the old man, whose stiffened limbs aided him but little, for the spiral stair-case was steep and consisted of many steps; but the gallery was gained at last, and both looked anxiously out upon the ocean, but all that was visible were the angry crests of white foam crowning the dark billows beneath, and they waited for the next flash of lightning to dispel the gloom and reveal the position of the doomed ship, if she was still above water. 
               The dismal signs of the coming tempest which had foretold to the practiced eyes and ears of Louise, a storm of more than ordinary severity, even for that stormy sea and high northern latitude, had not belied their predictions. The gale now howled, raged, and roared with a fury that Christian Jansen, during an experience, of sixty years, had seldom witnessed. At intervals a sudden gust of extraordinary violence seemed to shake to its foundation the solid stone turret in which they stood. Rain mixed with hail dashed against the stout, but transparent, horn casements which shut in the gallery of the tower, with unrelenting fury; but the thunder and lightning which had pealed and flashed almost incessantly while they were ascending the steps, was temporarily hushed, and all above the boiling foam of the sea was wrapped in impenetrable darkness. With what terrible suspense, what awful anxiety they now waited for the vivid lightning, and the roaring, crashing thunder which had, but a few minutes before, caused the strong nerves of the keeper to shrink and the courageous heart of Louise to quail! Could it be possible, in the short time that had elapsed since Louise quitted the gallery, that the gallant ship, which scarcely an hour ago, had borne in safety a score of brave seamen, whose hearts beat high with hope at the prospect of speedily reaching their destined port, had sunk beneath the waters, carrying with her into the ocean's depths the whole of the hapless crew? Neither Christian Jansen nor Louise dared to trust themselves to speak; but each knew the other's thoughts, and both shuddered as these terrible thoughts crossed their minds. 
               At length the thunder, which seemed to have rested only to gather increased force, again mingled in the terrific war of elements. A blinding flash of sheet lightning lighted up the sea and sky to the extreme verge of the horizon with a brilliant glare which rendered perfectly distinct the most minute objects; while zigzag streaks of red, forked lightning darted from the clouds in a dozen different directions as if a dozen tongues of living flame had been hurled from heaven by the Almighty hand, to accomplish the dread work of destruction which even the fierce fury of the tempest had spared. It was but for a moment; then the fiery glare changed to a livid hue, and all was again shrouded in darkness; and a clap of thunder followed, so crashing, so deafening, that Jansen and Louise both involuntarily pressed their hands to their ears to shut out, as much as possible, the fearful sound. Peal after peal rolled and crashed over the island, and reverberated among the peaks and ravines of the Hardanger Fjeld,
                     "The Hardanger Fjeld," the name of one of the most magnificent mountain ranges of Norway, which commences its rise from the head of the "Hardanger Fjord," and the highest peak of which is six thousand feet above the level of the Fjord. The range is distant east from Bergen, about forty miles. The term "Fjeld" (pronounced Fyel), and "Fjord" (pronounced Fyer), is given, the first to mountain ranges, the second to arms of the sea, extending inland, throughout the length of the Norwegian coast.
                   far distant on the main land, until at length the horrid din gradually died away in a succession of faint echoes. To the excited spectators it seemed as if the wind had for the time being hushed its breath, and the foaming billows stayed their wrath, awed by the terrific roar of heaven's artillery. 
               "This is fearful!" exclaimed Jansen, in alow, awe-stricken voice. 
               "Fearful indeed!" echoed Louise. 
               But the lightning had revealed to them the object of their anxiety. The gallant ship still floated; and with a skill and courage worthy of a better fate than that which awaited them, had the brave crew exerted themselves in the midst of this terrific tumult of the elements to avert the doom which stared them in the face. 
               The vessel had drifted fearfully near the rocks; so near, that when the lightning flashed, to the breathless spectators in the turret of the light-house she appeared to be scarcely a quarter of a mile from the shore as they looked directly down upon her, though she was really at a far greater distance. Louise shuddered with horror as she thought, in the disordered fancy of the moment, that she could discern the forms, and even the pallid faces of the crew tinged with a livid hue, as the lightning vanished away; and the quick seaman's glance of old Jansen had, even in those few seconds, observed that the broken spars had been cut away, and the vessel's prow headed off to seaward. 
               "Brave fellows!" exclaimed the old man. 
               Louise took courage from his exclamation. 
               "There is still hope, grandfather; they may yet escape to sea?" she said. 
                
               Jansen shook his head. 
               "Never!" he cried; "never, unless by a miracle. If the wind should cease, the sea would set her ashore before midnight, let them hold her to the wind with all their skill and seamanship. Nothing can save them but a gale of wind as strong as this now blowing, setting in from a different direction. The case is hopeless. Dost thou not perceive the utter folly of attempting to render them assistance, Louise?" 
               "Nevertheless, I will still try," was the reply of the generous-hearted girl; "it is my duty to do so, grandfather." 
               "And whither wilt thou go to seek for aid, Louise? Thou couldst not reach the village by daylight in this storm, nor even the nearest cottage. In two hours all will be over." 
               "The cottage of Rolf Frode is scarcely distant a furlong from the bridge at the end of the promontory. The road thither is practicable, and I know the safest track. I will ask Rolf to go and seek additional assistance, while I wait at the cottage. Supposing one-but one life is saved, grandfather?" 
               "Then go, my brave lass, and my blessing go with thee, and God guide thee in safety through the storm and darkness, and reward thy efforts," said the old man, overcome at last by the courage and humanity of the maiden. "Go at once; lose no time. My old limbs will carry me down the steps, though they refuse to carry me up." 
               Louise made no reply; but embracing her grandfather, flew down the steps; kissed the cheek of her grandmother as she passed through the kitchen, and the next instant stood outside the cabin, exposed to all the fury of the storm. 
               Nothing but the consciousness of the noble purpose which had urged her to make the effort, could have supported the generous Louise in her hazardous journey. It might be, in all probability it would be, in vain. The attempt was to a certain extent Quixotic, for it was the next thing to a certainty that no human aid could be of any avail to the crew of the hapless vessel. 
                
               But Louise could not bear the thought that a band of human beings, seemingly on the verge of destruction, should be allowed to perish without an effort being made to save them. 
               Familiar as she was with the sight of the ocean lashed into fury by tempests, this was the first time she had witnessed a ship in imminent peril. 
               But twice, as the old light-house keeper had said, had he known vessels to drive on the rocks of Sartaroe. These shipwrecks had occurred many years previously, shortly after Christian Jansen had taken charge of the light-house, when Louise was too young to realize all the horrors of such a catastrophe. The fierce gale almost lifted her off her feet, the rain and hail blinded her eyes, and soon drenched her to the skin, in defiance of the thick clothing-impervious to an ordinary shower-which she wore. As she had said, the cabin of Rolf Frode was less than a quarter of a mile from the light-house; but to travel a quarter of a mile on such a night, was equal to undertaking a journey of twenty times the distance on an ordinary occasion, so far as regarded the difficulty of the task, though she hoped to reach the cabin in a few minutes. The darkness was such as might be felt. A faint reflection from the lanterns of the light-house alone pointed out the path. To stray from it, even the distance of a few feet on either side, would involve certain destruction; for the road was narrow, and lay along the edge of the precipice; and on the inner side was a deep ravine, the sides covered with stunted, dark green fir-trees, at the rocky bottom of which the swollen waters rushed in a sweeping torrent, fed by the melting snows which poured down the cleft uneven sides of a range of rocky hills, which rose in the center of the island, and extended throughout its length. The gale blew furiously from seaward, and the principal difficulty was to avoid being driven over the declivity on the opposite side by the force of a sudden gust of wind. More than once the daring girl was compelled to stop and cling with all her might to the slender trunks of one of the young trees which had been planted, a few yards apart from each other, on the edge of the ravine. The vivid flashes of lightning, which played almost incessantly, dazzled her vision, and only served to render the succeeding darkness more palpable, and to increase the hazards of the journey; the peals of thunder clashing, as it were, directly over her head, and rolling away in the distance; the sound again returning in reverberating echoes from the distant mountains on the main land, until the fainter echoes were lost in the crash of a succeeding peal, deafened her ears even to the tumultuous roar of the toiling ocean beneath the overhanging precipice. At one time the fury of the gale was such that she feared to loose her hold of the shrub to which she had clung for security, after having thrown herself upon the ground. She thought she would be compelled to relinquish her generous purpose, and return to the light-house; but to return was to incur equally as great danger as to press onward. She mentally chid her faintness of heart, and when, at length, the squall passed over, and the gale partially lulled, she rose from her recumbent posture and again struggled on. 
               At length the great danger was past. She had reached in safety a point where the path turned off from the cliff, and led down a gentle declivity, where she was partially sheltered from the violence of the wind; and at the bottom, standing in a sheltered nook, amid a grove of larch and fir-trees, and not more than a hundred yards distant, was the cabin of Rolf Frode, the glimmer of a lamp visible through the chinks of the closed shutters. The courageous girl now quickened her pace, and in another minute stood at the door of the cabin, at which she rapped loudly. 
               The door was opened by Rolf himself, and the hardy young fisherman shrank back half in surprise, half in terror, when he saw the drenched and be-draggled figure of the young girl. Prone to the superstitious belief common to the fishermen and peasantry of Norway, and utterly at fault to conceive what could have induced a female of earthly mold to venture abroad on such a night, the young man believed the figure before him to be the wraith of some shipwrecked maiden. Louise noticed his affright, and said, as gently pushing him aside, she entered the cabin, 
               "It is I, Louise Sigvald. Do you not know me, Rolf Frode?" 
               Relieved of his superstitious fears, the surprise of the youth was rather increased than diminished; but he waited not to ask what had caused this strange and untimely visit from one who would at any time have been the most welcome visitor who could have darkened his door. Hastily closing the door of the cabin, to shut out the drifting sleet, he placed his arm around the waist of the now almost fainting girl, and carried rather than led her into the inner apartment where his sister Hilda and her children were sitting. 
               The astonishment of Hilda was not less than that of her brother. Her first thoughts were that something was wrong at the light-house; that some accident had befallen Christian Jansen or his wife; or that they were, one or the other of them, seriously ill, perhaps dead. And this question she asked as she drew a stool to the fire and almost forced Louise down upon it. 
               "No, no, Hilda," was the reply. "My grandfather and grandmother are as well as usual, excepting that both are suffering just now from rheumatism. It is to ask a favor of Rolf that I have come through this fearful storm." 
               The countenance of Rolf Frode would have served as a study for a limner, as he listened to these words. "Louise Sigvald to venture abroad on such a night to ask a favor of me!" he thought. "Of me, who have never yet dared to tell her how much I value one word from her lips, one favorable glance from her eyes!" What was the nature of that favor, neither he nor his sister, who was looking on with equal surprise depicted in her visage, could form the slightest conception. In the opinion of Hilda, the conduct of Louise was unmaidenly; but Rolf had made up his mind to grant any favor Louise could ask, whatever it might be, if it were possible for him so to do, and Louise well knew that such would be his resolve. 
               "You must brave the storm as I have done, Rolf," said Louise. "A ship has drifted before the gale, within the skerries, and is now drifting, slowly but surely, upon the rocks opposite the light-house. Every effort to render aid to the crew may be futile-though God grant that it may be otherwise-but they must not perish while we remain idle in our cabins, sheltered from the fury of the tempest, without making an effort to save them." 
               "Within the skerries, and drifting upon the rocks opposite the light-house!" exclaimed Rolf, shaking his head. "Then God help the unfortunates, for man can not." 
               "God help them!" ejaculated Hilda. 
               "But something may be done, Rolf," continued Louise, speaking rapidly. "Something must be done. The cottage of Hans Petersen is not far distant; and near by several fishermen have their abodes. You must go thither, Rolf, immediately-no time must be lost-and summon them, and carry ropes and spars and whatever may be thought useful, to the cliff. If Erik Lodbrok did not live so far off, he might also be summoned. His pilot-boat is at anchor in the harbor. It will live in any weather, and he might put off and attempt to save the crew." 
               "No pilot-boat, nor no boat that floats could live in the sea that now runs between the skerries and the island," said Rolf, a shade of jealousy, which, however, to do him justice, passed away in a moment, darkening his open countenance, on hearing Louise mentioning the names of his rivals. "Before midnight the vessel will be dashed to pieces on the rocks, and the crew swallowed up by the waves. But I will do your bidding, Louise Sigvald, were it to grope my way through the darkness and the tempest, even to Sartaroe village, or to the far end of the island; and I will engage to return with a dozen brave men who will do all that men can or dare do; but it will be in vain." 
                
               "I knew you would, good Rolf," replied Louise, extending her hand, which was eagerly grasped by the honest young fisherman, who felt at that moment that he could dare to launch his boat and put off to the hapless vessel, though he should perish in the attempt, if he could still live in the memory of the young maiden. 
               "Go quickly, good Rolf," continued Louise, "and I will wait your return. Hilda will, I know, provide me with some dry clothing, for I am drenched to the skin." 
               This request was needless. Hilda had already busied herself in putting more wood into the stove, and had now gone to her closet, from which she returned with a quantity of dry, warm clothing, which she carried into the bedroom, and then urged Louise to divest herself of her drenched garments and put on the dry ones which she had provided. 
               Before Louise returned from the bedroom, Rolf had thrown his waterproof fisherman's coat around him, and left the cabin, and Louise seated herself by the stove, to await his return with the expected succor. 
               The storm still raged with undiminished fury; but the journey which lay before Rolf Frode was not fraught with the danger and difficulty of that which had been undertaken and accomplished by Louise. The road no longer lay along the verge of the precipice, and although it was flooded in many places, it was in a hollow, and thus, in a measure, sheltered from the violence of the wind. 
               It is true that in places where the flood had risen to its greatest height, the only passage was over rude bridges formed of the trunks of trees, hastily and carelessly thrown across the pools and resting insecurely upon projecting ledges of rock; but Rolf knew every step of the way in the darkness, as well as if it had been broad daylight, and he was young, active, and athletic, and too much accustomed to battle with the elements to be daunted even in the midst of their most terrific warring. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER III. 
               THE SHIPWRECK AND THE RESCUE. 
               THE cottage inhabited by Olaf Petersen, the father of Hans, was scarcely a mile distant from Rolf Frode's cabin. It was the largest of a cluster of cottages or cabins which was called "The Hamlet," in contradistinction to the larger and more populous "village" in the center of the island. Olaf Petersen was a man of mark among the inhabitants of Sartaroe, being the richest man on the island, and the owner of a dozen or more of fishing-boats, which he hired out to the less fortunate residents. 
               Despite the raging of the storm, it did not take long for Rolf Frode to make his way to the hamlet. Louise had expressed her regret that the village in which Erik Lodbrok, the pilot, resided, was so far distant, since his larger boat would be better qualified to face the fury of the gale and to ride over the raging billows than the fragile skiffs of the fishermen. Rolf knew full well, and, as the reader will recollect, had so expressed himself to Louise, that no boat could live, and no man, pilot or fisherman, would dare to leave the harbor, while the storm raged as violently as it did now; but he had not told her that, in all probability, Erik might be found at the hamlet, and in the cottage of Olaf Petersen. The season of navigation had commenced. A few of the pilots had already found occupation on board such merchant vessels as had made their appearance off the island, bound for Bergen or even for Christiansund, and other northern ports; for the coast of Norway is so dangerous that many of the more cautious ship-masters took pilots on board off Sartaroe, although bound to distant ports. 
               The season for sleighing parties, and visiting, and social winter-evening gatherings was past, and in a few days the pilots would be still reduced in number, and the great fishing fleet would put to sea for the spring cruise; in fact the island would be almost deserted by its male inhabitants, with the exception of the children and the old men, whose infirmities prevented them from engaging in the arduous duties which occupied the men of Sartaroe. 
               It was a time-honored custom among these rude, hardy, but hospitable people, to unite in general social gatherings, a few days before the revival of the active duties of the summer occupied the whole of their time and attention, and Rolf knew that one of these gatherings was being held at the cottage of Olaf Petersen, that evening. He had himself been invited, but some pressing business had delayed him till the storm came on, and his sister, to whom he was fondly attached, had then begged him to remain at home. That Erik and a dozen or two others would be there to share Olaf Petersen's hospitality, he had little doubt, although he had serious fears whether the copious libations of corn brandy, which it was the custom to indulge in on these occasions, might not incapacitate Olaf's guests from being of much service-if, indeed, any body could be of any service-in attempting to render assistance to a foundering vessel in such a storm as that then raging. 
               The fury of the tempest, he knew full well, would not in the slightest degree affect the conviviality of those of the invited guests who had assembled at the cottage before it had burst forth in its wrath. The cabins and cottages on the island were built so substantially, with a view to the exclusion of cold and wind, that once within doors, and shutters barred, and a fire kindled in the stove, creating a degree of heat insupportable to those unaccustomed to it, no severity of weather without, could affect the inmates, and snugly sheltered from its fury, no storm, however violent, had any terrors to those daring men, inured to hardships from childhood, and accustomed to do battle with the fiercest warring of the elements. As Rolf drew near the hamlet, the lights glimmering through the shutters of every window in the cottage of Olaf Petersen, satisfied him that he was not wrong in his calculations, and before he reached the door, even above the howling of the wind, he could hear the voices of the roysterers within, roaring out the boisterous chorus of some Norwegian ditty. 
               Some time elapsed before he could make himself heard, although he pounded at the door and shutters of the dwelling with all his might. At length the door was opened by the sister of Hans, who welcomed the new comer, and led him into the room where the party was assembled. 
               It was a very large apartment, one end of which, large as the room was, was almost entirely occupied by a large stove, which emitted so intense a degree of heat, that Rolf, coming in from the cold wind and rain, was almost stifled, used as he was to a high degree of temperature within doors. A long uncovered deal table occupied the center of the apartment, extending throughout its entire length, and around this table were seated, on wooden benches, some eighteen or twenty men, all shouting forth, at the top of their voices, the national song of Norway, and rapping on the table till the flasks and drinking horns, with which it was strewn, danced again, when they came to the chorus: 
                      
                        "For Norge, Kjempers Fde-land, 
                        Vi denne Skaal udtmme, 
                        Og, naar vi furst faae Blod paa Tand, 
                        Vi sdt om Friehed drmme: 
                        Dog vaagne vi vel op engang, 
                        Og bryde Lnker, Baand og Tvang." 
                     
                  
                
               This song has been freely translated into English, and we subjoin the translation of the first verse, quoted above; 
                  
                      
                        "To Norway, valor's native sphere, 
                        We drink with boundless pleasure! 
                        O'er wine we dream of freedom near; 
                        In fancy grasp the treasure: 
                        Yet shall we at some period wake, 
                        And bonds compulsive nobly break." 
                     
                  
                
               They were singing the last verse when Rolf entered, and they did not cease when he made his appearance-nor did he seem to expect it. On the contrary, when the party arrived at the concluding chorus, 
                      
                        "For Norge, Kjempers Fde-land, 
                        Vi denne Skaal udtmme," etc., 
                     
                   and every man rose to his feet to do greater honor to the sentiment, he united his voice with theirs, raising it to its highest pitch, and clapping his hands and stamping his feet as enthusiastically as any one present as the final note died away. Then each man filled his drinking horn to the brim with brandy-Rolf joining the rest in this patriotic libation also-and emptied it at a draught; and then the rafters of the room rung with the cheers which followed. This ceremony concluded, the party resumed their seats, with the exception of the host, Olaf Petersen, who had been seated at the head of the table. He now advanced toward the new-comer, and heartily welcomed him, good-humoredly chiding him for coming at so late an hour, after which he led him round the room, each guest rising and shaking hands with Rolf as he passed. 
               "And now," said old Olaf, "sit down, Rolf, and join the party, and make up for lost time. By the valor of Odin, it would but serve you right to make you drink a flask of brandy clean off, to place you on a level with the comrades whom you have slighted." 
               "I can not stay to-night, Olaf Petersen," said Rolf. "I have been sent hither at the bidding of Louise Sigvald-" 
               "Ah! the pretty blue-eyed jade!" interrupted old Olaf, who was already beginning to feel the effects of the brandy he had drunk, well-seasoned as he was; "so, Rolf, you have been tempted to forsake your comrades and absent yourself so long from the 'parting feast,' by the wiles of a pretty girl, eh? But now we have you here, you can't leave us again till morning, and in such a storm, too. No, no, boy. No one leaves the cottage of old Olaf Petersen to-night." 
               The old man spoke jestingly and in perfect good-humor; but several of the younger men, and especially Hans and Erik, glanced angrily at Rolf, when he mentioned the name of Louise. Disregarding the angry looks of the young men, and resisting the efforts of Olaf Petersen to force him to be seated, Rolf continued, 
               "There is a foreign ship, in a disabled condition, between the skerries and the island, drifting fast toward the rocks. Louise Sigvald has dared to venture, amid the storm and darkness, to my cabin to seek aid for the crew when the vessel strikes the rocks, as she must do. She is waiting my return with Hans Petersen and Erik Lodbrok, and any others who will join us, and wants us to proceed with ropes and light spars, and every thing else that may be of service, to the light-house." 
               "Of what use can we be?" cried half a dozen voices at once. "The vessel and crew are doomed, if they be in the position you mention. Not all the men and all the boats belonging to the island can save her." 
               "Hans! Erik! will you do Louise Sigvald's bidding?" continued Rolf, unheeding the remarks which had been made. 
               "It is useless, but I will go," said Hans, springing up from his seat. 
               Erik looked as if he would much rather remain where he was than face the storm on a bootless errand, even at the request of Louise Sigvald. He hesitated for some moments, but at length rose, and expressed his willingness to go likewise. 
               "It is useless! Leave the vessel to her fate. We can do nothing!" repeated several of the guests; others, actuated probably by the same feelings as those which had induced Erik to offer to accompany Rolf, expressed their willingness to join the party; and yet others, tempted by cupidity, and, although conscious that no aid could be rendered to the crew, eager to be near the spot where the vessel would strike and go to pieces, in order, when the gale sufficiently abated, to be the first to launch their boats, and thus secure a large share of such portions of the cargo as might float-which was considered legitimate spoil-also expressed their readiness to go with Rolf and his party, and thus the young fisherman secured eight or ten of the guests besides Hans and Erik. But the rest, who had drank more freely of brandy, or who had not been able to bear up under their copious libations so stanchly, strenuously objected to breaking up the "parting feast," to go on any such fool's errand; and old Olaf Petersen, among the rest, was loud in his protestations that the party should not be broken up. Had it not been for the determination of Rolf and Hans, it is probable that the persuasions of old Olaf, and those who were inclined to his opinions, would have led to the volunteers resuming their seats and recommencing their carouse; but Erik, who, for reasons of his own, had resolved that if Hans and Rolf quitted the cottage, he would not be left behind, now determinedly ranged himself on their side, and the rest of the volunteers joined them for very shame. 
               Finding that neither persuasions nor expostulations were of any avail, Olaf Petersen, who had locked the outer door of his cabin, was compelled to acquiesce in the young men's determination; but he insisted that a parting bumper should be drank all round, and that the whole party, those who were about to leave, and those who had resolved to remain, should join in a parting song and chorus. 
               Rolf and Hans fumed and fretted at this delay in vain they were compelled to give way to the majority, which comprised, in fact, every body excepting themselves, and with an enthusiasm, almost as great as that which had been displayed when the national song was sung, and in tones as uproarious, goblet in hand, and standing, the whole party sung the favorite Norwegian ballad, commencing, 
                      
                        "Kong Christian stod ved hien Mast 
                        I Rg og Damp," etc.,
                              "King Christian stood by the lofty mast
                              In murky light," etc.
                           
                         
                     
                   and only when the last words of the ballad had been sung and the goblets drained to the dregs, would Olaf grant permission to the young men to take their departure. 
               Then amid many animadversions against the folly of young men in listening to the persuasions of silly girls, and many positive asseverations of the utter futility of any attempt to render assistance to the vessel or her crew, the old man, and those of his guests who remained, resumed their bacchanalian orgies, totally regardless of the fact that within a short distance of the spot where these drunken orgies were going forward some twenty of their fellow-creatures were doomed shortly to find, if they had not found already, a watery grave! 
               The rain had ceased while Rolf had been inside the cottage, and the sky overhead had partially cleared up, and though the wind had abated little or none of its violence, it had changed round to the northward, and the thunder was now only heard faintly rolling in the distance. The moon was approaching its full, and had already risen sufficiently high to shed its light over the scene; the short journey, therefore, to Rolf Frode's cabin, was rapidly and easily accomplished. The party was warmly welcomed by Louise, who had been most anxiously and impatiently awaiting Rolf's return; and he, as well as Hans and Erik, were rewarded for their prompt obedience by a hearty grasp of the hand of each by the warm-hearted girl. No time was lost in starting for the light-house, and in a few minutes the party reached the narrow pathway over which Louise, a little more than an hour before, had passed in almost total darkness. But the change in the wind had not in the least benefited the ill-fated vessel. The moon now afforded sufficient light for the party to observe, from the great height on which they stood, every maneuver on board. The vessel had drifted fearfully close to the rocks, and a dangerous cross sea had arisen, which rendered her unmanageable, and mocked the efforts of the crew. It was evident to all that half an hour would barely elapse ere she must strike on the rocks and go to pieces. 
               The rocky promontory on which the light-house stood, rose perpendicularly from the sea to the height of full three hundred fathoms, and the water beneath was probably of a corresponding depth. A vessel drifting directly toward the precipice, would have struck broadside on; and such the keeper of the light-house anticipated would be the fate of the ship, which, when first seen by him, was drifting directly toward the promontory; but the change of the wind, and the cross sea which this change had raised, had caused her to make a more southerly drift, and she was now setting right on to a range of low pointed rocks, whose tops in calm weather were barely visible above the water, and whose position was now only defined by the foaming surf and spray dashing madly over them. They were evidently seen by the unfortunate crew, who appeared at last to have given themselves over to despair, and resigned the vessel to her fate. She was within a quarter of a mile of these granite columns, and drifting bodily toward them. A cry of horror burst from the party as they saw her swing round, and at the same moment witnessed her fore and mizzen masts go by the board. Her mainmast had been lost or cut away at an earlier period of the gale. Every minute-nay, every moment-urged her on more rapidly to the destruction which inevitably awaited her. She might have been a thing endowed with life, which, at length, driven to desperation by the futile efforts she had made to avert her doom, was rushing madly on, eager to anticipate the collision which would dash her to atoms, and thus at once end the now hopeless struggle with fate. 
               Breathless with horror, the party hastened on to the lighthouse, scarcely hoping to reach it until all was over with the hapless objects of their anxiety and heartfelt sympathy. 
               They gained the promontory, and rushed eagerly on to the verge of the precipice, approaching, notwithstanding the violence of the wind, so near to its edge, that, to the unaccustomed eye, it would have appeared as if every moment some one or other of the party would topple over and fall headlong into the raging abyss beneath, where the waters were boiling like a seething caldron. Old Christian and his wife, forgetting or unheeding their rheumatic pains in the excitement occasioned by the fearful event about to occur before their eyes, and-were it not for the noise of the conflicting elements-within hearing of the unfortunate victims, had hobbled out of their cabin, and stood gazing awe-stricken upon the frightful scene. Louise, and the party she had urged to the rescue, stood in a compact group, drawn together as if for the purpose of mutual support, conscious in this dread moment of the utter weakness and worth-lessness of mere human skill and daring, when the God of Nature chooses to awaken the elements to strife. They stood clustered together, looking down from the precipice into the boiling, foaming, smoking abyss, in breathless awe, utterly regardless of the war of elements going on around them, their attention wholly concentrated upon the doomed ship. 
               The moon had risen, and was sailing in queenly majesty through the infinite space, reflecting her beams in the dark billows, and rendering every object as distinctly visible as if it were noon-day-for the sky was perfectly clear, and the moon's disc wholly unobscured, save by the thin fleecy scud which flew swiftly through the air, midway between earth and sky. Beneath this scud all nature was in a state of fierce commotion; above it, the moon, and those "lesser lights which rule the night," shone forth in glorious refulgence, seeming to float calmly and serenely in the clear ether, removed far above the strife and turmoil of the lower world; too calm, too lofty, too pure, too far removed above the sphere of groveling humanity to heed the "wreck of matter" going on beneath them. 
               Rolf and several of his comrades had brought with them short coils of rope, and oars, and boat-masts; but as Louise had been told, and was now unwillingly compelled to acknowledge, they had encumbered themselves with this load to no purpose; the heavy, stout strands of rope were of no more avail than would have been as many skeins of packthread. All they could do was to look down-with a dreadful fascination, which forbade them to withdraw their eyes from the fearful sight-upon the unfortunate victims of the tempest, whose doom was sealed. 
               Each huge swelling wave that rolled along, gathering increased volume as it drew nearer the vessel, threatened to prove the one on which she would be borne to destruction; but wave after wave passed by, each bearing her onward, and nearer to the fatal rocks, heaving her alternately high upon its surface and then plunging her into the yawning furrows of the sea; and still, staggering and reeling to and fro like a drunken man, the unmanageable vessel hung back from the fearful leap into the surf, which foamed and fumed amid the pointed breakers. She still seemed like a thing of life that had rushed madly and despairingly to meet her doom, and who now, repenting of her rashness, when too late, shrank back appalled from the fate which sooner or later, but very soon, at furthest, she must meet. 
               And now a huge wave was seen in the distance rolling slowly and steadily forward toward the ship. Every eye watched its approach, for all seemed instinctively to be aware that this would be the last upon whose foaming surface the doomed vessel would float. The moonlight was so bright, and, from the lofty eminence upon which the awe-stricken party stood, the vessel appeared to be so directly beneath them, that they could distinguish the crew, lashed to the bulwarks, and apparently motionless, and despairingly awaiting the awful death from which they knew there was no possibility of escape, although, in fact, the vessel was full a quarter of a mile distant from the base of the frowning precipice. On came the mountain billow; it reached the ship, and heaved her with astonishing rapidity to its surface, where she lay, poised for a moment, as if in mid air, and then she was urged along with still increasing swiftness in the direction of the raging breakers. A simultaneous cry of horror burst from the lips of the spectators as she descended-as if hurl d by invisible force-into the midst of the surf, into which the vast volume of water, after forming itself into a frightful curve, displaying a black, yawning, watery cavern, broke with a crash that was distinctly heard upon the summit of the precipice, for the moment completely overwhelming the vessel and concealing her from the sight of the horror-stricken spectators. Then again her black hull became visible, staggering and struggling amid the seething caldron. The receding undercurrent drew her back, only again to be hurled with increased momentum into the surge, and, prow foremost, on the half sunken rocks. There was one terrific crash-but one-and all was over. All that now remained of the lately stout and stately ship was a mass of broken planks and spars, dashing about confusedly among the breakers. 
               The spectators of this frightful scene gazed at one another with pale faces and terrified looks, but no one spoke. All eyes were again directed toward the wreck, watching to see if there was sign of living thing amid the tangled mass of spars and rigging, tossed to and fro as if in sport amid the broken surf. There appeared to be none. All on the board seemed to have been dashed to pieces. 
               Presently, however, the quick eyes of Louise discerned, floating in the comparatively smooth water beyond the surf, what appeared to be a human form lashed to a spar. 
               "Rolf! Hans!" she exclaimed, her voice breaking the charm of silence which, from the moment the party had reached the spot on which they stood, had sealed their lips; "see yonder. What is that? It looks at this distance like the figure of a man bound to a spar. It may be so; and perhaps he yet lives, and may be saved." 
               The young men thus addressed, gazed long and earnestly in the direction indicated by the maiden. Hans was the first to speak. 
               "It is one of the unfortunate crew, I have no doubt," he said, "though at this distance it is impossible to be certain; but I doubt if he has escaped with life from the midst of that foaming surf. His skull has, most likely, been crushed to pieces against the rocks." 
               "But can it not be ascertained?" cried Louise, in a voice trembling with agitation. "Will no one launch a boat and rescue him, if he be one of the crew, and be still living?" 
               "It would be alike dangerous and useless," replied Hans. "The chance is that the man, if indeed it be a man, and not a mass of tangled rigging, is dead ere this; besides, no boat could live in this sea." 
               "But, see," rejoined Louise; "the water is smoother beyond the surf. Hans, Rolf, Erik can none of you do any thing? Your pilot-boat, Erik, will breast the billows, inside the reef. Hans and Rolf will go with you. For the sake of the friendship you each and all bear to me, make one effort to save life, even if it be the life but of one of that unfortunate crew." 
               The young men looked at each other, and then, after conferring together for a few moments, turned away in the direction of the slope which led to the harbor in which the pilot-boat was moored. 
               The remainder of the party, divining their purpose, and desirous of rendering assistance, followed them down the descent, leaving the light-house keeper and his wife and Louise alone on the rock. 
               It did not occupy much time for these hardy and practiced seamen to unmoor the little vessel, and those who remained on the rocky height soon descried the pilot-boat, standing out beyond the southern point of the promontory, under a close-reefed lug-sail, and gallantly breasting the billows. 
               The eyes of Jansen and his wife and grand-daughter were now riveted upon the pilot-boat, which at one moment was seen mounted aloft on the summit of a wave, and the next almost hidden from view in the trough of the sea. The dark object which had attracted the attention of Louise, and had led her to urge the young men to this daring adventure, was no longer to be seen; but the pilot-boat was steering in the direction in which it had last been visible. 
               Soon the boat itself was only occasionally visible, a mere speck on the summit of the waves. The suspense in which Louise remained was almost unendurable. "What," she thought; "if they should be unable to discover the object of which they have gone in search, or should find it too late to be of service!" and, dreadful thought! "What if any accident should happen to the boat or her gallant crew, and I the cause? For I urged them to dare the perilous attempt." 
               Her anxiety was, however, soon partially relieved, by the reappearance of the pilot-boat, now close-hauled to the wind and approaching toward the harbor. Her crew would reach the anchorage in safety, beyond a doubt; but had they discovered the object of which they had gone in search, or had they failed, and found it advisable to return before getting too far out to sea? 
               Christian Jansen and his wife and Louise watched the progress of the boat with intense anxiety, until they saw that she had weathered a point which afforded partial shelter from the gale and brought her into comparatively smooth water. Then the two former returned to the light-house, and Louise hastened away in the direction of the harbor. By the time she reached it the boat had rounded the inner point and entered the smooth bay. She was soon alongside the rude wharf to which she was usually moored, and Hans and Rolf sprang ashore, while Erik and the other young men remained on board to secure the vessel safely. In a moment Louise was standing by their side. 
               "Have you been successful?" she asked, in a voice tremulous with excessive emotion. 
               "We have," replied Hans and Rolf, in a breath. "We have picked up one of the crew." 
               "And he still lives?" 
               "Yes," said Hans; "thanks to Erik's brandy-flask; but his life hangs by a slender thread." 
               "You had better carry him up to the light-house, where Grandmother Jansen can attend to him. She is skillful in such cases as this," said Louise, and this advice seeming to be the most plausible method of proceeding, was adopted. In a few moments more the rescued man lay on a bed in the kitchen of Jansen's cabin, having been previously stripped of his wet clothing and wrapped in warm blankets by the young men. 
               The rescued man did not appear to be more than twenty-two or twenty three years of age, and notwithstanding his pallor and his bruised and swollen features, for he had been severely cut by the rocks, and bruised by the broken spars of the wreck, his face looked as if it might be handsome. 
               Although he still breathed, his respiration was so feeble that it was evident that the utmost care and caution would be necessary to retain the vital spark in his frame. He was quite unconscious, and lay motionless on the bed, with his eyes firmly closed. But Margaret Jansen, whose skill as a nurse was proverbial on the island, particularly in such cases as this, which, owing to the peculiarity of her position, frequently came under her care, expressed herself certain of his recovery. The young men would have remained if they could have rendered further service, and offered to do so; but Margaret Jansen said it was needless, and therefore, after having received the warm and earnest thanks of Louise, they left the cabin. It still wanted some hours of daybreak, and perhaps they thought they would yet be in time to reach the hamlet before the carousal at Olaf Petersen's cottage was over. The shocking scene they had witnessed would not deter them from rejoining the boisterous party they had left. They were brave and humane when these qualities were called into exercise, but too much accustomed, from childhood, to witness scenes of peril, to permit such scenes to make any permanent impression on their minds; but Rolf, Hans, and Erik, quitted the light-house each under the pleasing impression that he had established a permanent claim to the favor of Louise. 
               "It was my pilot-boat," thought Erik, "which ventured to sea: otherwise the man must have perished. Hans and Rolf could not have ventured out of the harbor in their fishing-boats." 
               "It was me," thought Rolf, "upon whom Louise first called. Had it not been for me, she could not have procured the assistance she sought." 
               "It was to me," thought Hans, "that Louise first pointed out the drowning man. She knew that, at her desire, I would dare any danger." And so, each happy in the thought of the service he had rendered the maiden, they hastened back to the hamlet. 
               Margaret Jansen, assisted by Louise, was meanwhile occupied in the humane endeavor to restore consciousness to the sufferer, and, thanks to their care, he soon showed symptoms of rapidly returning animation. He opened his eyes, and looked wildly around him for some moments, and then, after swallowing a warm drink which the old woman had concocted, sank into a peaceful slumber. 
               Then, and not until then, Louise, who was thoroughly fatigued, yielded to the solicitations of her grandfather and grandmother, and retired to her bedroom, with a heart heavy with sorrow for the fate of the hapless seamen who had passed into eternity before her eyes; yet full of gratitude to heaven that one life had, through her exertions, been spared. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER IV. 
               A THREATENED INVASION OF A BACHELOR'S RETREAT. 
               ONE evening, six or eight weeks previous to the occurrence of the events recorded in the preceding chapter, Mr. John Templeton-formerly senior partner of the English branch of a wealthy mercantile firm, doing business between London and New York, now a retired country gentleman and the owner of a fine country seat situated on the banks of the Hudson-was seated alone in his library, occupied in looking over a large package of letters and books, received by the last mail from England. 
               Mr. Templeton had but a few minutes before quitted the dining-room, whence he had removed to the library, which he was accustomed to term his "snuggery," and into which he had ordered the servant to bring the wine decanter and glasses which had stood at his elbow while at dinner. 
               A bright coal fire was burning in the grate, imparting an aspect of cheerfulness, as well as an agreeable warmth to the room. A bronze branch-candelabra, in which three wax candles were burning, stood on the table at which the gentleman was seated, affording sufficient light to render visible every object in the apartment. The floor was richly carpeted, and the walls completely covered with book-shelves, amply filled with a choice selection of books on almost every conceivable subject, with the exception of the space which had been allowed for a few rare paintings and pieces of statuary. 
               The chairs were dark mahogany, and constructed with a view to ease as well as elegance; and that occupied by Mr. Templeton was a reading-chair, so constructed as to adapt itself to the posture desired by the sitter. Robed in his dressing gown and slippers, and the wine on the table before him, Mr. Templeton seemed the very impersonification of luxurious ease. It was a blustering March night, and the ground was covered with snow; but the shutters of the library were closed, and the sound of the wind without only served to give additional zest to the sense of comfort and security within. Mr. Templeton was a gentleman who might have seen fifty-five summers, although he still looked as hale and hearty as a man of forty-five. He was a stout, fresh-complexioned man, with brown hair, brushed upward off his forehead, and slightly streaked with gray. His whiskers, also turning gray, were trimmed with the utmost care, and the general nicety observable in his person and attire, as well as in the disposition and quality of the furniture of the apartment, betrayed the man of taste and refinement. He would have seemed to a chance observer to be one of those favorites of fortune, who only know, from hearsay, of the anxieties and troubles which afflict the great mass of mankind; for his portly frame, and his ruddy, healthy visage showed that he possessed physical health, equally as the appointments of his household showed him to be a man of wealth, and yet Mr. John Templeton did not seem quite at ease on this particular evening. He held a letter in his hand, which he had read twice over, and muttering a vexatious "Psha!" and making an accompanying impatient motion with his right foot, he let his hand fall into his lap, and falling back in his chair, sat with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling, apparently absorbed in no pleasing reverie. 
               We will leave him to his cogitations while we take the opportunity of introducing him more particularly to the reader. 
               The ancestors of Mr. Templeton had been among the earliest emigrants from England to Virginia, where, for several generations, they had held a high position, and ranked, themselves, not falsely nor boastingly, among the "first families" of the Old Dominion; but in America the wheel of fortune is ever turning, and the poor man of to-day may be the millionaire of ten years hence. Misfortunes befell the Templeton family, one after another, until, at length, the parents of Mr. John Templeton were reduced to the verge of poverty. In his fifteenth year he was left an orphan, without any provisions having been made for his future, beyond those most estimable of all, the religious and moral teachings of a pious mother, and as good an education as it was possible for his parents to bestow upon him. Not a thorough education, certainly, for he was too youthful to have yet acquired that, under the most favorable circumstances; but so much of the rudiments of knowledge as were calculated to foster the desire to seek to penetrate more deeply into the arcana of science, taught in such a manner as to lead him to love all that was beautiful in nature or art. 
               Still he was, at the death of his mother, left nearly destitute, and without any living relative, save a sister, in her tenth year, nearly six years younger than himself. Foreseeing that the North was likely to open to him a wider field for the prospect of future advancement than his native State offered, he resolved upon trying his fortune in New York. A kindly neighbor had offered his sister a temporary home, and, with five dollars in his pocket, the young Virginian landed in New York city. A few days' experience taught him that if he did not wish to starve, if he hoped ever to fulfill the last promise he had made his dying mother, viz., to support and protect his sister, he must lay aside his fastidious notions of obtaining "genteel" employment, and accept any engagement that might be offered to him, however humble. He was a bright, intelligent-looking lad, and within a week after his arrival in New York, he obtained the situation of errand-boy in a large mercantile establishment. He performed his duties faithfully, and opportunities occurred, as opportunities will always occur to those who choose to take proper advantage of them, which enabled him, without ostentation or presumption, to show his employers that he was capable of occupying a much more respectable position in their employ. 
               One year after his arrival in New York, he was offered the situation of a junior clerk, at a salary of four hundred dollars a year. A year afterward his salary was raised a hundred dollars per annum, which increase he sent to Richmond for the support of his sister, and the following year he was promoted to a higher post, with a salary of seven hundred dollars a year. 
               He thought himself now justified in sending for his sister to join him in New York-for kind as were the motives of the friend who had offered her a home, he felt that it was a brother's province to support his only sister, and relieve her from dependence even upon the most generous of friends. 
               About this time, the firm by whom John Templeton was employed extended their business and established a branch house in London, which eventually became the principal branch of the concern. Five years passed by, in the course of which young Templeton had risen to become the cashier of the house in the employ of which he had commenced his career as errand-boy. During this period, although occupied during the day in purely mercantile pursuits, he had not neglected the mental culture, the absolute necessity of which-if he wished to make a figure in the world, and to become really a valuable member of society-had been implanted in his mind by his mother. The house in London had entered into an extensive business arrangement with a firm in Paris and another in Berlin; but none of the English partners being acquainted with the language spoken in these cities, the necessity of engaging the services of some person proficient in French and German, and at the same time conversant with mercantile affairs, and of sufficient probity to be intrusted with the business of the house, which would become, in a great measure, so far as its continental transactions were concerned, dependent upon the continental agent, was made apparent to all the partners. 
                
               One day the principal partner of the firm in New York, came to the desk of young Templeton, and thus addressed him: 
               "Mr. Templeton, you have written us an occasional letter in French and German. You perfectly understand those languages?" 
               "Yes, sir," replied the young man, adding, with pardonable pride, "and Spanish, likewise." 
               "Mr. Templeton," continued his employer, "we find the absolute necessity of employing some person conversant with these languages, and at the same time trustworthy, and acquainted with mercantile pursuits, as our representative on the continent. My partners in England write me that mere scholars are plenty; but they find it almost impossible to find a person whom they can trust, who is sufficiently acquainted with the details of business to fulfill the duties we require of him; besides, we would much rather have a person in that situation who is familiar with the peculiar management of our own business. I have thought of offering the post to you. We shall be sorry to lose your services here; but if you accept our offer, it will be to our mutual advantage. Your salary will be raised to an annual sum sufficient for your maintenance in such a style as will befit your position, and if you satisfy us, a partnership will be offered you in the course of a few years." 
               It is needless to say that this offer was gladly and thankfully accepted by the youth. He went to England, visited Paris and Berlin, and transacted all the business intrusted to him with so much ability, so much credit to himself, and so much profit to his employers, that he won their golden opinions. From that hour his fortune was made. At the age of twenty-four, John Templeton became a junior partner in the London branch of the firm, and one of the partners dying and another retiring from active business, within three years from his promotion, at the age of twenty-seven, he found himself actually the head of the London branch of the firm, since the nominal head was an old man of seventy, who never troubled himself with the details of the business. 
               John Templeton now sent for his sister, who had still been residing in New York, to rejoin him in England. Five years more elapsed, and John Templeton-sixteen years before the errand-boy in a New York house-found himself at the head of the leading branch of that same house in London. 
               I have now to explain how it was that, with gray hairs beginning to show themselves in the dark brown locks of John Templeton, notwithstanding his hale, and hearty appearance and his evident exuberant health and ample fortune, he happened to be seated, at the age of fifty-four, twenty two years after he had attained the prominent position in society I have spoken of, reading with so much apparent annoyance the letters he had received from London. 
               There exists no man without his failings, except in romance, and every body will acknowledge that a man depicted without these weaknesses of humanity, is an unenviable object, who, so far as the interest or even the love he excites in his fellow-man is concerned, might as well be at once translated to heaven. We can not love, we can hardly respect a man who pretends to be a saint on earth. John Templeton, the American, the democrat, had one great failing-or virtue-at any rate he had in perfection the sentiment common to all mankind and to all brute-kind of the higher grades, though he would not readily have acknowledged it-he was at heart an aristocrat. Perhaps his long residence in England, of all countries the most aristocratic in feeling, had tended to foster this sentiment; but whatever might have been the cause, it was a ruling passion, smothered under a pretense of democracy, in John Templeton. 
               Raised to the position of the head of a mercantile firm of acknowledged wealth and importance, he found himself courted by the effete members of an aristocracy, which, boasting blood, wanted money, and were ready to enter into any alliance which would not, "heraldricly," soil the purity of their shields. Many a scion of noble stock would gladly have wedded with the sister of John Templeton, simply in the expectation that the money she would bring would restore the impoverished estate of her husband; but, notwithstanding the wealthy American banker and merchant was a welcome visitor at the houses of the most exclusive of the aristocracy, no daughter of these-some of them impoverished houses-could wed with the merchant-the trader. 
               It was foolish in John Templeton to feel annoyed at this. Perhaps his Virginian blood and descent had something to do with it. He had been taught to believe that his ancestors had once mingled their blood with that of the proudest of England's aristocracy, and he could not understand how the fact of their having emigrated to America had sullied the purity of his descent. 
               Perhaps he might have laughed this fancy away, but, unhappily, he foolishly-the wisest of men will be fools sometimes, and John Templeton was no exception to the rule-suffered himself to fall desperately in love with the daughter of a gentleman, who, although he boasted no title, claimed to be a direct descendant from one of the Norman robber knights who crossed the Channel with William the Conqueror. 
               This proud descendant of the Norman fillibuster was glad to borrow money of the wealthy merchant and banker, nor did he regard with objectionable eyes the attentions paid by his only son, and the heir to immense (mortgaged) estates, to Miss Alice Templeton, the sister of the friend whose resources had more than once saved him from impending ruin; but when the plain merchant, John Templeton, demanded from her father the hand of Miss Mary Harcourt of Harcourt Hall, having previously obtained the lady's consent, the proud aristocrat-fearful to refuse too peremptorily, lest he should offend the man whose services he needed-still made so many objections, couched beneath such flimsy excuses, that the pride of the American was aroused. He at once waived his purpose, and declined the second interview which was proposed. 
               The following week Miss Mary Harcourt was sent to Paris, having left a letter behind her, in her own handwriting, for Mr. Templeton, in which she stated that she had consulted her father, and that it would be better for all if no future reference were made to the subject upon which Mr. Templeton had spoken with Mr. Harcourt. 
               This was enough; John Templeton never saw Mr. Harcourt nor Miss Harcourt again. He was, however, devotedly attached to his sister Alice, who had long been wooed by William Harcourt, the son of the proud aristocrat, and he could not find it in his heart to oppose any obstacles to their union, especially as the idea was favorably entertained by the young man's father, who made no objections to becoming related, through the female line, to one whose money he was glad to borrow, but whom he did not consider to be sufficiently elevated above the common herd to become, in his own person, one of the representatives of the Harcourt family. 
               Mr. William Harcourt was a common-place, weak young man, whose education had been greatly neglected; not that he had not studied, at Harrow College with clt, and quitted Corpus Christi, Cambridge, loaded with university honors; but he was as ignorant as a child in all that appertained to that knowledge which would lead, in case of necessity, to his own advancement in life; and the fortunes of his family had fallen to so low an ebb, that, in the opinion of the shrewd merchant, if young William Harcourt came himself into possession of his father's estates, he would be the last member of the family who would inherit them. 
               However, William Harcourt and Alice Templeton were married; and, although John Templeton refused to see the elder Mr. Harcourt, that gentleman yet managed to secure another loan from him, to sustain the dignity of the family, and to defray the expenses attendant upon his daughter's wedding. 
                
               About six months after the marriage of her brother, Miss Harcourt married in Paris a German, adventurer, who, notwithstanding he boasted the title of a baron, barely possessed the means of supporting himself, without resorting to pursuits not altogether reputable-so it was hinted-to supply himself with money. Mr. Harcourt objected to this marriage; but his objections were of no avail. A clandestine marriage had already taken place. He refused to see or acknowledge his daughter; and, after residing in Paris for eighteen months, the baron and his wife sailed from Havre de Grace for Memel in Prussia, which was a the residence of the family of the former. The vessel, however, never reached her destination; and was believed to have foundered at sea, with all her passengers and crew on board. 
               After the death of the elder Mr. Harcourt, which occurred about two years after his son's marriage, William Harcourt succeeded to the estate, which was, however, so deeply mortgaged that but a very small disposable income fell to the new proprietor, who, in fact, depended chiefly upon the interest of a sum of money which had been invested in the three per cents, by a maiden aunt in behalf of her niece-the sister of William Harcourt-who had perished at sea. Still he maintained, as far as he was able, the expensive habits of his father; and, by dint of borrowing money, by pledging still deeper the family estate, until it was evident to Mr. Templeton, who himself held a lien on the property, and who was aware how deeply it was involved, that whenever William Harcourt's death occurred, the holders of the mortgages would seize the entire estate-if, indeed, they did not do so previous to that time-he kept his horses and hounds, subscribed to the hunt, and, in fact, maintained the style of a gentleman of ten thousand a year. 
               Beset with duns, and constantly annoyed and embarrassed, his temper became soured, and he neglected his wife and family for the society of his bacchanalian friends; and the consequence was, that after the birth of his second child-a daughter-Mrs. Harcourt separated from her husband; the elder child-a son-remaining with the father, while the mother took the daughter with her. 
               Mr. Harcourt's habits were not conducive to longevity, particularly as his constitution was naturally weak. A debauch following a day's violent hunting, at length brought on a fever, of which he died, when his son Henry was about fourteen years of age. 
               As Mr. Templeton had anticipated, immediately after the death of Mr. Harcourt, his creditors became clamorous, and but for his (Mr. Templeton's) active interference, the estate would have forever passed away from the family; but lawyers were, employed, the affairs of the late proprietor were thoroughly investigated, and it was found that in the course of twelve or fifteen years, if the property was properly improved-for of late years it had been sadly neglected-the mortgages could all be paid, and the estate restored to the heir at law. Matters, after some delay, were satisfactorily arranged; Mr. Templeton was constituted the guardian of young Henry Harcourt, and a sufficient annual sum allowed out of the rentals to support the boy at school, and a liberal income apportioned to him after he should become of age until the redeemed, estate should pass into his hands. The income derived from the money in the funds, which was a intended originally to be the portion of Mary Harcourt, was accorded to the widow of William Harcourt; and on this income, which amounted to about five hundred pounds a year, aided also by liberal presents from her brother, the widow maintained herself and her daughter, a child of ten years old. 
               Henry Harcourt was naturally a boy of generous disposition and good abilities, but he had been spoiled by his father. Allowed to do as he pleased; to associate, at a tender age, with his father's boon companions; accustomed to hear coarse writticisms aimed at the female sex-especially after his mother had separated from her husband-it was little wonder that he grew up to be wild, reckless, and almost unmanageable if thwarted in his humors. He was about as disagreeable a charge as could well fall into the hands of a precise, steady bachelor of fortyfive or fifty years. 
               Mr. Templeton sent the youth to school, where he remained until he was seventeen years old, and then proposed to send him to college; but Henry would not hear of this. He declared that he had had enough of school and study, and wished to travel for a few years. His uncle suggested that he should study law; but this he positively refused. The Harcourt estate, he said, would one day be his, and why should he trouble himself with stupid, musty old volumes, the only purpose of which was to teach a man how best to cheat his fellows. He proposed, of his own accord, to enter the army, but to this his uncle objected; and then, unless his desire to travel was gratified, he threatened to go to sea. At last, for his own peace and quiets sake, Mr. Templeton acceded to his nephew's wishes, and he was sent on the Continent-a traveling companion having been provided for him, in the person of a young gentleman who had just left Cambridge University, where he had been studying for the Church. Henry Harcourt remained abroad three years, returning to England at the age of twenty-one. His late father's affairs were then in a fair way for settlement, and his mother hoped the young man would settle down at home, until, in the course of a few years more, he took possession of the family estate. 
               Nothing, however, was further from his thoughts. His three years of travel had only increased, instead of satiating his love of adventure. He paid a short visit to his mother and sister, and then returned to London; saw his uncle, and demanded the liberal annual allowance, accorded to him by his father's creditors, to expend as he should think fit. 
               His demand was complied with, and he again went abroad. 
               Shortly after this event Mr. Templeton retired from active business. He longed to return to, his native country, and as soon as he had arranged his affairs, he sailed for New York, where he had previously purchased, through an agent, the property on which he resided when we first introduced him to the reader. 
               The letter, which, we have observed, apparently caused annoyance to Mr. Templeton, was from his sister, who had written to say that she intended to visit her brother, and if he were willing, to take up her abode with him for some time. She also, she wrote, wished to visit her native country again. She felt weary and lonesome in England, particularly as her son was abroad, and she should embark in the next packet ship that sailed for New York. 
               Now, as the reader is aware, Mr. Templeton was very much attached to his sister; but he had lived in solitude all his days, and had no desire, at his time of life, to change his habits; besides, the ill-usage Mrs. Harcourt had met from her husband, had embittered a temper not naturally good, and Mr. Templeton knew that his sister and his housekeeper, whom he had brought with him from England, would not agree. He had only seen his niece once or twice, and he did not know whether she would be contented to live in the retired manner to which he had accustomed himself. She was now a young lady of seventeen, and if her disposition was any thing like her brother's, she would turn his house topsy-turvy, and involve him in all sorts of troubles and expenses; but there was no help for it. His sister was already on her way. He could not refuse her admission to his house, and therefore he must take things as they came, and hope for the best. 
               He pictured, however, all his bachelor comforts at an end. No more quiet happiness; no longer any will of his own; his very library invaded, and bickering, chattering and confusion in his house from morning till night. No wonder the old bachelor felt annoyed at the visions of misrule his fancy had conjured up. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER V. 
               PROSPECTIVE TROUBLES HAVING THEIR ORIGIN IN WHIMSICAL FANCY. 
               A VIOLENT jerk at the bell-rope brought a servant into the room. 
               "Is Mrs. Jenkins in her room, Thomas?" inquired Mr. Templeton. 
               "I believe so, sir;" returned the man. 
               "Go and see, Thomas, and if she is disengaged, ask her if she will oblige me by stepping into the library." 
               "I may as well tell Mrs. Jenkins at once," muttered Mr. Templeton, as soon as the servant had closed the door and departed on his errand. "I don't know what she'll say about it, I'm sure; but I suppose I shall have to hire another servant, a lady's maid, or something of that sort. The Lord knows when they'll be here. 'The next packet,' Alice writes. God bless me! the next packet might have sailed the day after this which brought the letter." 
               There was a gentle tap at the door. 
               "Come in," cried Mr. Templeton, and Mrs. Jenkins entered the library. 
               She was a prim old lady-perhaps five years older than Mr. Templeton, although it would have been difficult for any one to guess her age. There was not a wrinkle on her clear, smooth skin, not a gray thread amid the soft brown hair, so smoothly banded on either side of her broad brows. Her blue eyes were as bright and clear as those of a child; not a crow's-foot was visible at the corners, and though slightly inclined to corpulency lency, her figure was as straight, and her step as firm as those of a woman in the prime of life. Her dress of black silk was as glossy and free from stain or rumple as if it had just come from the dressmaker, and had, by the hands of the artiste herself, been fitted to the person of the wearer; and the untrampled snow, lying on the lawn a front of the house, was not more unsullied in its purity that were the starched white cap and the neatly folded shawl-like handkerchief which adorned the head and covered the shoulders of the housekeeper. 
               It was evident that Mr. Templeton stood a trifle in awe of this lady, notwithstanding the position he held as master of the household of which she was the superintendent merely; and yet, beyond a certain look of firmness and decision, which told that she would require implicit obedience, from the inferior servants under her charge, and would look over no gross impropriety of conduct, the expression of her face was that of good-nature and benevolence. 
               "Ah! Mrs. Jenkins," continued Mr. Templeton. "Take a seat, pray-near the fire, Mrs. Jenkins. I hope I have not interrupted you in any occupation; but I sent Thomas for you to tell you that I have received letters from England." 
               "From Master Henry, sir?" said the housekeeper, her countenance brightening as if in anticipation of pleasurable news. 
               "No, not from Henry Harcourt, the young scapegrace," said Mr. Templeton; "his name is hardly mentioned. He's off on some ramble, I suppose, and doesn't think it worth his while to waste his time in writing to any body." 
               "Ah, sir, you're too hard on the poor boy. He may be a little wild or so, but it's only natural to one of his age. He'll grow wiser and steadier as he grows older," returned the housekeeper. 
               "He is old enough now to conduct himself like a young gentleman, who is one day to occupy an influential position in his country," said Mr. Templeton. "When I was his age, I was head-clerk in one of the largest houses in New York, and had all the business of the firm upon my shoulders, and there is he gallivanting about from one part of Europe to another, thinking of nobody but himself, and of nothing but spending money foolishly, when he ought to be preparing for the duties that he will be expected to take upon himself in a few years more. There's nothing to hinder him from going into Parliament now. He's twenty-three years old." 
               "Only twenty-two, on the second of January last, at twenty-five minutes past eight in the morning," said the housekeeper. "A mere boy yet." 
               Mr. Templeton smiled, as he continued: "No, Mrs. Jenkins, the letter I particularly alluded to is not from Henry, but from his mother, Mrs. Harcourt." 
               "Ah! poor lady," answered the housekeeper; "I hope she is well, sir; and little Alice, too. Deary me-how time flies, to be sure. Alice must be growing to be quite a young woman now, sir. There's where it is, Mr. Templeton. If Master Henry had only had his mother to take care of him, he'd have grown to be one of the sweetest young gentlemen in the world. Deary me, deary me! but it was a sad thing, sir, them disagreements atween Mr. Harcourt and his wife-begging your pardon, sir, for alluding to family matters, which perhaps I oughtn't to; but, speaking of Master Henry-" 
               "Never mind Henry now," interrupted Mr. Templeton, who knew that when once Mrs. Jenkins mounted her hobby and began to dilate upon the many excellent qualities she fancied she saw in her young favorite, it was difficult to divert her attention to any thing else. "If Henry is good for nothing else, he is at least able to look after himself and take his own part. I'll give him that much credit; but, I was going to say, you have been very comfortable since I took you into my service, Mrs. Jenkins, after the breaking up of the household at Harcourt Hall; I hope so, at least. I have done my best to make you happy and comfortable, I'm sure." 
                
               Mrs. Jenkins looked somewhat disconcerted. She couldn't exactly comprehend the object of Mr. Templeton in thus addressing her. It might be his intention to send her away. He might intend to break up housekeeping, and return to England; or, perhaps he was about to get married-a proceeding to which Mrs. Jenkins would have decidedly objected, for she knew, in that case, her reign would be over; or-Mrs. Jenkins had heard of such things-he might be about to make her an offer of marriage. Old bachelors sometimes married their cooks; why not then their housekeepers? She was a tolerably well educated woman; had been as much a companion as a servant to her master, and had attended to all his wants, and humored all his fancies-in her own way-with as much assiduity as any wife could have shown. If he really should be thinking of such a thing-why-Mrs. Jenkins didn't know that she should make any particular objection. But perceiving that Mr. Templeton was awaiting her reply, she said: 
               "A better, kinder gentleman never lived than you, sir, barring those, little obstinacies which you sometimes put on-just to hide the generous impulses which always actuate you." 
               "Well, well, Mrs. Jenkins," replied Mr. Templeton, "I have done my best, but never more than my duty; I was going to say that it is my earnest hope that our mutual pleasant relations toward each other may continue until one or other of us is no more; but this letter of which I was speaking, Mrs. Jenkins, My sister, Mrs. Harcourt, writes me that she and her daughter are about to visit the United States, and to take up their abode with me; perhaps to remain here." 
               Had a bomb-shell fallen at Mrs. Jenkins's feet, or, to speak more to the purpose, had Mr. Templeton said that he was about to marry a lady who was a total stranger to his housekeeper, she would not have been half so much frightened and disconcerted as she was by this announcement. Mrs. Harcourt, though in the main a well-meaning lady, was, as we have heretofore intimated, of a less happy disposition than her brother. 
                
               She was querulous and discontented. Some people ill-naturedly intimated that the disagreement between her and her husband was created quite as much by her unfortunate temper, as by his gross and careless habits; and no one knew the peculiarities of the lady's disposition better than Mrs. Jenkins, who entered Mrs. Harcourt's service as lady's maid, directly after her marriage, and had been appointed housekeeper subsequently to the birth of her daughter Alice. She had remained at the Hall in that capacity until the death of Mr. Harcourt, when she had accepted Mr. Templeton's offer, to assume the control of his bachelor's household, and, as is usual in such circumstances, she had for many years ruled his domicile as completely and uncontrolledly as if she had been his wife. She well knew that as soon as Mrs. Harcourt arrived, the attempt, at least, would be made by that lady to usurp the authority which she had held for so long unquestioned, and for some moments she made no reply. 
               At length she bridled up, and said curtly, 
               "I presume, Mr. Templeton, if that be, the case, my services in your household will be no longer needed. I shall be sorry to leave you, but-but-"She had risen from her chair as she spoke, but was unable to complete the sentence. She sank upon her seat again, and, placing her handkerchief to her eyes, wept bitterly. 
               "Confound it!" muttered Mr. Templeton, between his teeth. "Here's the beginning. I knew how it would be. No more rest in this world for me. Why the d-I is it that the womenfolk won't let a man alone, when they see that he's happy and contented with his lot without them? Surely England's large enough for Alice to live in; or, if she wishes to come to America, and I've no business to say she sha'n't, I ought to be glad, confound me! to see my sister; but surely she might live somewhere else than with me; and, yet, I can't tell my own sister and my own niece that they sha'n't stay at my house. I'd sooner, though, make up a room for that young scapegrace, Harry. I could, at least, give him a hint that his longer abode at my house was disagreeable, if we didn't happen to agree well together;" and the bachelor rose from his chair, and thrusting both hands into his trowsers pockets, commenced whistling, as was his wont when he was perplexed on any subject. At length he advanced to the housekeeper, and, taking her hand, said kindly, 
               "Mrs. Jenkins, whether my sister comes or not, as long as I have a house to take care of, you remain as my housekeeper. Let us hope that things will go on as comfortably henceforward as they have done heretofore. It sha'n't be my fault if they don't; and then, perhaps they won't stay," and he rubbed his hands gleefully at the thought; "perhaps they won't stay! Alice will be dull here' up in the country, and I won't remove to the city to please either her or her mother, that's flat," and Mrs. Jenkins suffered herself to be comforted, and dried her tears, and finally, after drinking a glass of wine which Mr. Templeton poured out himself and handed to her, even talked cheerfully over the arrangements it would be necessary to make in order to accommodate the anticipated additions to the family, and spoke of Miss Alice, and praised her beauty as a child, and wondered if she had grown up as handsome as she promised to be, and wound up, as she always, did when any allusion was made to the Harcourt family, with extravagant praises of' her favorite, Henry Harcourt." 
               "Well, that squall's blown over for the present," said Mr. Templeton, when Mrs. Jenkins had left the room. "I got over that more easily than I expected; but there 'll be trouble yet. Confound the women-folk," he muttered, as, after drinking another glass of wine, he pushed the decanter aside, and taking one of the magazines from the heap before him, proceeded to cut the leaves open, in the hope of forgetting the source of his annoyance in the perusal of the contents of the periodical. 
               At ten o'clock precisely, Mr. Templeton rose from his chair, went the rounds of the house to satisfy himself that all the doors were locked and bolted, as he had done precisely at the same hour from the first day he had taken possession of the villa he now occupied; then, returning to the library, he lit his bedroom candle, put out the candles by the light of which he had been reading, and retired to his bedroom. 
               While slowly undressing, for he did every thing slowly and methodically, his thoughts again reverted to the subject which had occupied them during the early portion of the evening. To tell the truth, he felt somewhat ashamed of himself on account of the dissatisfaction he could not help feeling at the idea of his sister's visit. 
               "I am a selfish, unfeeling fellow," he muttered; "without a single relation in the world that I am aware of, excepting my sister Harcourt and her children, and with more money than I can ever spend, here I am complaining because Alice, poor thing, is about to pay me a visit, when, if I were like other men, I should be overjoyed at the very idea. But these lonely bachelor habits, after all, though they are very comfortable-I won't deny that they are very comfortable-make ascetics of those who indulge in them. 
               "Well, Alice and her daughter shall be welcome, come when they may, and stay as long as they will; but! mustn't permit any interference with Mrs. Jenkins. No, Mrs. Jenkins must keep the keys and rule the house as she has done for so many years. I must make that known to my sister as soon as she arrives. 
               "Alice promised to be very pretty last time I saw her," he continued, after a pause. "I suppose I shall have the house full of young fellows, coming to court her, and thinking that her rich old uncle will give her a portion. There 'll be another source of annoyance. I don't want any young fellows here, and I won't have them, either, that's flat. So Miss Alice needn't think of it. Confound it, there I am going off at a tangent again. How do I know whether the poor child has any such thoughts?" 
               The fancy, however, appeared to have brought the days of his own brief courtship back to his memory. He went to his writing-desk, and pressing a secret spring a drawer flew open from which he took a miniature painted on ivory and set in gold. It was the portrait of Mary Harcourt, whose melancholy fate had deeply affected him at the time, notwithstanding her unfeeling rejection of his suit. It was a lovely face, despite the hauteur apparent in the firmly set lips and in the proud carriage of the exquisitely-formed head. He gazed upon it long and earnestly, and then suddenly laid it aside, with a slight gesture of contempt, as if he scorned his own weakness, and locking the desk, cast his eyes toward the clock on the mantelshelf. 
               "God bless me!" he exclaimed. "Eleven o'clock, I declare, and I ought to have put out the candle and got into bed at twenty minutes to eleven precisely. Well, well, it's no use wrestling with fate; but the mere intimation of my sister's intention to visit me, leads to all manner of irregularities." Leaving the worthy, though eccentric old bachelor to his dreams, we will take the opportunity, afforded by his slumbers, to return with our readers to the light-house of Sartaroe, where we left Louise, also sleeping, after having been the means of saving the life of the youth by whose side her grandmother was watching. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VI. 
               THE RECOVERY, AND THE INTERVIEW WITH THE WRECKERS. 
               THANKS to the elasticity of youth, the shipwrecked man awoke in the morning from the profound slumber into which he had fallen, perfectly restored, although for some minutes after he opened his eyes he was unable to collect his ideas or to understand where he was, or how he had come into the condition in which he found himself. The blackened, smoke-dried rafters over his head, and the various articles of rude furniture, similar to those which may be found on shipboard, gave to the apartment in which he lay, something of the appearance of a ship's forecastle, only that it was much larger and much more airy, and then a glance toward the window satisfied him that he was on shore somewhere, though he had not the slightest idea where. He raised himself on his elbow and saw Margaret Jansen sitting at the head of his couch, and dozing like one wearied with night-watching; and spread on a bench before the fire he recognized his own clothing. He glanced at the apparel which he wore; it was of a coarse fabric, and the shirt and trowsers were much too large for him. He certainly had not donned them of his own accord. Presently he recollected the sudden rising of the storm the day before, and the peril in which the ship had been placed, as, utterly disabled, she drifted at the mercy of the winds and waves. He remembered the rushing onward of the mighty wave which had completed the work of destruction-and that was all! He knew that he must have been shipwrecked, and picked up by some humane and daring seamen; but how he had been saved, or by whom, he knew not. The old lady attired in outlandish garments, who had evidently been watching by his side, continued to doze, rocking her body to-and-fro, and muttering some uncouth sentences in some unknown jargon. His first impulse was to wake her; but on second thoughts he drew back the hand he had stretched out with that intent, and suffered her to doze on. His thoughts reverted to the vessel and the crew. Had all or any of the latter been saved? or was his life the only one the elements had spared? His was evidently a philosophical temperament, for after taking another general survey of the crew, he fell back on his pillow, muttering to himself, 
               "Well, this is a new adventure, and it is adventure that I am seeking. I shall know soon enough where I am and how I came here." 
               He was about to close his eyes and try to sleep again, when the sound of a gently opening door, and an exclamation of mingled surprise and delight attracted his attention, and casting his eyes in the direction of the sound, he caught a glimpse of one of the sweetest female faces he had ever seen. It was but for a moment, for the girl drew back bashfully and timidly when she observed that the stranger was awake; but the start he gave and the noise of the closing door roused the old woman, who seeing the young man sitting up in the bed, addressed him in Norske, and receiving no reply, for her words were unintelligible to him she addressed, she repeated her question in broken German, almost equally unintelligible. Still the youth comprehended sufficiently her meaning to reply in German that he was an Englishman. 
               "Den you tale Engleesh?" replied the old woman. "Me too. Eig tale Engleesh littal." 
               A conversation was carried on in English, eked out with a few words of German when it was necessary, and the young man learned that he had been picked up the night before by some Norwegian boatmen and brought to the light-house; also that the vessel had been lost, and that of all the crew he alone had been saved. 
               The youth expressed a desire to rise, and the old woman, pointing to his clothing on the chair before the fire, rose from her seat, and hobbled away to call her husband. 
               In a few moments the keeper of the light-house entered the room, and advancing to the bed on which the young man was seated, shook hands with him, and expressed his delight at, seeing him so happily restored. 
               The light-house keeper spoke English much more readily than did his wife. 
               "Mother," he said, using the appellation by which he usually addressed his wife; "mother tells me that you speak English. All we pilots and fishermen of Norg forstaaen of English a little. We see so much sailors of your countries." 
               The old man repeated more intelligibly that which his wife had previously told the youth, adding what interested the latter greatly, viz., that it was owing to Louise, his grandchild, that the peril of the vessel had become known to the fishermen, and that his life had been saved. 
               "It was the sweet face of Louise, then," thought the youth, "that peered in at the door just now, and retreated so bashfully when I turned my eyes toward her." 
               The clothing which had been stripped from the youth when he was first brought into the light-house, was now sufficiently dry to put on; and when he had dressed himself, the change from the coarse fisherman's garb added greatly to his appearance. 
               It was a sailor's garb-a blue jacket and trowsers-that he wore; but the cloth was finer, and the clothing more neatly fashioned than was usual among the seamen who were accustomed to visit those northern shores. 
               This did not fail to attract the notice of the light-house keeper, as well as did the delicacy and whiteness of the young man's hands, and the refined expression of his smooth, though sun-burnt face. 
                
               "You are not a sailor nor yet were you the captain of the vessel which is lost. You are too young to have been the captains besides, the captains who visit us are not like you." 
               "I was a passenger in the ship," replied the young man. 
               "Yet you wear a sailor's dress," replied the light-housekeeper, laying his hand on the sleeve of the young man's jacket. 
               "For convenience' sake on board ship," said the youth. "I have long been accustomed to travel by sea, and I adopt the dress of the seamen." 
               "Whither was the vessel bound?" demanded the light-house keeper. 
               "To Bergen and Christiansund," was the reply; "but is nothing saved?" 
               "Possibly," replied the old man, "such portions of the cargo as will float will be picked up by the fishermen to-day. See, the storm has abated; and already the water is black with their boats seeking for what Fortune may send them. Ah!" continued the old man, with a sigh, "I am too old and infirm now to join them. I shall get nothing!" 
               "I will see that you are rewarded for your kindness to me," said the youth. "Do not trouble yourself about the plunder that may be picked up, though, if any thing is found that belongs to me, I suppose I shall be allowed to reclaim it?" 
               The old man shook his head. 
               "Our Norsemen are brave," he said. "They will risk much to save life; but what God spares them from a wreck-it is not often much-they claim as their own. Still I shall see." 
               The young man did not seem to approve of this species of doubtful morality; but he made no reply. In fact he was thinking in what manner he would be able to supply himself with the means necessary to prosecute his journey, if he recovered nothing of his property from the wreck. 
               The old man appeared to divine his thoughts. "The Herr," he said, "speaks of rewarding me. I have done little or nothing, and ask no reward; but if all that was on board the ship is lost, how can the Herr proceed on his journey?" 
               "How, indeed?" replied the young man. "I have funds at Christiansund, for it was to that place I directed remittances to be transmitted from Hamburg. I did not intend to remain long in Bergen. But how to reach Christiansund without money, or how to support myself without funds here, until I can write to Christiansund and receive a reply-there's the difficulty." 
               "Does the Herr know no one in Bergen?" asked the old man. "Bergen is not far distant." 
               "No, no one," replied the youth; "but I must see what can be done." 
               "Meanwhile," said the old man, "if the Herr can eat our humble fare, he is welcome to what the light-house can afford, until he can hear from Christiansund." 
               Margaret Jansen now appeared at the door of the adjoining apartment and spoke to her husband in the Norwegian tongue. 
               The light-house keeper replied in the same language, and then, addressing the young man in English, invited him to join the family at breakfast, which was set out in the next room. "But," added he, "by what name shall I call the English Herr?" 
               "Henry-call me 'Henry, now; that will, answer well enough," replied the youth, who was nothing loth to accept the invitation, for setting aside the fact that he was beginning to feel the cravings of hunger, he was eager to see and thank the young girl to whose courage and humanity he owed his life, and whose face, he rightly imagined, he had caught a glimpse of at the door of his sleeping-room. 
               The table was covered with a coarse though clean cloth, which was spread with cakes of dried oatmeal, a dish of boiled salted mutton, and a plate of very excellent butter. From a kettle on the stove, escaped the aroma of what promised to be very excellent coffee, and in the center of the table, surrounded with small horn drinking-cups, stood a flask of "brndevin"-the corn-brandy of the country-of which the light-house keeper offered his guest a dram before they sat down at the table. 
               It was humble fare that was spread before the stranger, but it was offered in a spirit of hospitality and without apology for its simplicity. It was the best the host had to offer. It was their own daily food, and they were not sufficiently refined to bore their guest with apologies and wishes that it were better, and to a shipwrecked man, who had stood a narrow chance of himself having become food for fishes, and whose appetite was craving to be satisfied, it is doubtful whether the most dainty fare that could have been offered would have been more acceptable. 
               The young man was greatly disappointed at not seeing Louise at the table, and he was on the point of inquiring after her and expressing his desire to thank her for the service she had rendered, when she entered the room, bearing in her hand a can of warm milk, fresh from the cow, which she placed upon the table, and then, without hesitation, yet with a sort of bashfulness which added to the charm of her manner, she advanced to the youth, and taking his hand, expressed, in the Norwegian tongue, her delight at seeing him so perfectly recovered. 
               The light-house keeper told her that the young man, Herr Henry, was from England, whereupon she repeated the words she had spoken, in that language. 
               Her accent was foreign, and her language was broken; but the young man thought he had never heard the words of his own language so musically uttered, or seen a brighter being than she who stood before him. The fresh morning air had deepened the roses on her cheeks, heightening the contrast with the fair skin of the brow and neck, and her bright blue eyes sparkled with delight. She wore not the slightest trace of the fatigue she had undergone the evening before. A few hours of sound and peaceful slumber had sufficed to restore her elastic frame to its wonted vigor. 
               During the meal a conversation was kept up-with some little difficulty-in relation to the shipwreck, and the young man told how he was the only passenger on board. The ship was called the Jung Frau, Captain Gamb, and was manned with fourteen seamen. She had sailed from Hamburg a week before, and until she met with the storm, had had a favorable passage, although for two days the weather had been cloudy and the captain had been unable to correct his reckoning. As he had before intimated, she was bound to Christiansund-touching at Bergen-and the captain, probably deceived by a northerly current, believed that he was to the northward of the island of Sartaroe, when it was discovered-the fog suddenly lifting-that they were close upon the skerries, off the southern shore of the island. The mistake was, discovered too late-and the loss of the ship and of the entire crew was the shocking result. 
               After breakfast, Louise, whose household duties were already completed, acceded to the young man's request that she would guide him to the scene of the disaster. 
               As the reader is aware, the edge of the precipice from which Louise had gazed, on the previous evening, and listened to the ominous warnings of the coming tempest, was but a few yards distant from the light-house. 
               It was almost inconceviable that in so short a time the face of nature could have been so completely changed. The wind was still blowing fresh from the sea, but it was not unpleasantly strong; over head the sky was clear, save where here and there hung masses of dark cloud edged with silver, seeming to be disjointed fragments of the heavy canopy of storm and thunderclouds which had clung in one black, unbroken mass a few hours before. The sun was shining at one moment, and the next moment was temporarily obscured behind those dark masses, his hidden rays adding additional luster to the silvery fringes of the clouds, and the air was vocal with the loud weird-like shrieks of the sea-birds, which were flying about in myriads, wheeling and circling to and from and occasionally diving down to the sea to catch some incautious denizen of the deep, whom the dazzling sunbeams on the waters had enticed too near the surface. 
               They reached the edge of the precipice, and Louise pointed out, in her broken English, the spot where, from the gallery of the light-house, she had first seen the ship. She directed the eyes of her companion to the position of the skerries against which the waves were still dashing and foaming, which had been so narrowly, and, alas! so uselessly avoided; and the low ledge of rocks, among which the surf was yet furiously raging, where the vessel had struck and been dashed to pieces; and then she pointed out the spot where she had first descried the dark form of the youth, who stood now in safety by her side, struggling amid the white foam of the raging billows; and the harbor where the boat was lying at anchor which had put to sea to his rescue. 
               There was a touch of deep feeling in the voice of the girl as she spoke of the gallant endeavors of the crew to save the vessel, and of the horror with which she had witnessed the last fearful scene. The young man shuddered as he gazed down into the deep abyss, and thought of those that lay buried beneath the dark waters, who, only the day before, were as full of life, and hope, and strength as he who now stood looking into the sea in which this life and hope were entombed. 
               He felt a sensation of reverential gratitude to the great Being who had seen fit to preserve him alone among all that crew; but he could not utter his thanks. To his mind it appeared as if such an expression would savor of presumption-for what, and who was he, more than those who had perished? But as he looked upon the slender form, and the beautiful and animated features of her who, directed by Providence, had been the means of his rescue, he experienced a feeling of respect for woman, and of admiration of her self-sacrificing spirit, such as he had never felt before. 
               Henry Harcourt-the reader will have recognized in the shipwrecked youth the nephew of Mr. Templeton-had been a traveler since his eighteenth year; he was now in his twenty-third. He had traversed Italy and Switzerland more than once, until the sight of Vesuvius and of the Bay of Naples had become habitual to him, and the romantic beauties of the Alpine regions had ceased to afford the zest of novelty. 
               Ever restless and eager for fresh excitement, he had, on the receipt of a letter, while in Hamburg, from a former schoolfellow who was traveling in Norway, resolved to join the writer at Christiansund, where he then was staying, in the hope of finding amid the savage grandeur of Scandinavian scenery the mental stimulus he craved. 
               As he now stood upon the brink of the precipice which formed the extreme point of a headland, affording an unobstructed view of gloomily-picturesque landscape and of the ocean, from the base of the overhanging cliff to the extreme verge of the horizon, he confessed to himself that he had never before witnessed a sight so grandly, darkly beautiful. 
               He had scaled much loftier peaks among the Alpine mountains, and gazed from them down into the unfathomable depths of the ravines; but the comparison afforded by still loftier peaks around him, had prevented him from realizing the immense altitude he had reached, and the woods, chalets, villages, and slopes of herbage at the mountain's base, while they really added to the beauty, detracted in some degree from the grandeur of the prospect. 
               Now, except that when gazing landward, here and there was visible the shadowy outline of the peaks of the Hardanger Fjeld range, resting, as it were, on the bed of clouds which shrouded the bases of the mountains, he stood on the brink of a cliff which overtopped the rugged, rocky precipices around him. The effect of the light and shade, as the sun shone forth from behind the straggling masses of cloud-seeming to shine still more brightly after each temporary obscuration-was magnificent beyond conception. The sea was still heaving tumultuously-appearing black as ink where the shadow of the cliffs rested upon its surface, save where the crested billows broke in snowy foam-until the eye caught the clearly-defined silvery line which marked the extent of the shadow. 
               On the verge of this line, their ragged edges barely visible, but their locality designated by the surf which broke over them incessantly, lay the fatal ledge of rocks upon which the ship had been dashed to pieces during the storm of the previous night; and far off to seaward were the skerries, on approaching which the ill-fated mariners had first become aware of their perilous position. 
               Immediately beneath the cliff, confusedly tossed about by the billows, were to be seen numerous bales and boxes, part of the cargo of the wrecked vessel; among which, manned by their hardy, daring owners, were some score of small skiffs belonging to the pilot-boats and fishing-smacks which lay at anchor in the harbor. 
               So small, so fragile, appeared these boats from the heights on which the spectators stood, and still so rough was the sea, that to the unpracticed eye of the young man, it appeared as if they were in momentary danger of being engulfed, as the seamen pulled eagerly and restlessly to-and-fro, seizing with avidity upon every thing, indiscriminately, that came within their grasp, and claiming it as lawful spoil. 
               The clamorous, unearthly shrieks of the sea-fowl, constantly on the wing; the melancholy, monotonous roar of the surf, dashing incessantly against the frowning, caverned rocks and precipices, which jutted here and receded there, as if the fragments of a ruined world had been scattered in chaotic confusion by some Titan's hand; the dark masses of clouds hanging overhead; the gray, transparent scud drifting above these clouds, showing that the atmosphere aloft was still violently stirred by the wind, and the bright glimpses of sunshine deepening the alternate periods of gloom, together made up a picture of dreary, savage desolation, which deeply impressed the mind of the youth. 
               For several minutes he looked on in silence, then turning to his companion, he said, 
               "And you, Louise-may I call you Louise?-you have always lived amid such scenery as this?" 
               "Not always," replied the maiden, in her imperfect English; which, however, was sufficiently distinct for the young man to understand. "Not always, yet ever since so long as I can remember." 
               "Then you were not born on this island?" 
               "No, far away-so many miles-near the Lindesnaez. I came here when so small a child," holding her hand about three feet from the ground. 
               "With your mother and father?" inquired the young man. 
               "Oh, no. My mother I have not seen, never; nor my father." 
               The young man looked upon her compassionately. 
               "And I might as well have known no mother," he muttered moodily. "You came here with your grandfather and grandmother?" he continued, again interrogating his companion. 
               "Yes. It is so, I have been told." 
               "And since you came here have never quitted the island?" 
               "Yes, once. Once I went to Bergen. O it is so fine a city! so many peoples! such fine shops! so much to see! You, Herr, Henry, have you in your country a city so fine as Bergen?" 
               "Oh, yes," replied the young man, "many much finer and larger, and more populous than Bergen. You must be very lonely here, Louise?" 
               "No, not lonely. In summer I have my little garden to tend, and when my work is done I walk on the cliffs, and sometimes go to the hamlet, and sometimes to the village, but not often; and Hilda sometimes comes to see me, and Katrina Petersen, and so many friends." 
                
               "And the young men of the village and hamlet?" questioned the youth. "They, I warrant me, don't absent themselves from the light-house?" 
               "Not often in time of summer do they come," answered the maiden, "but in winter. Oh then it is a merry time, and every night some peoples come to the light-house, and I go sometimes for a good many days to the village." 
               "And you like to walk on the cliffs, and to listen to the sea-fowl, and to watch them as they sail through the air, and to gaze down into the sea, and to watch the fishermen in their boats?" 
               "Yes," briefly replied the maiden. 
               "And you have no desire to leave Sartaroe, to see the cities and inland towns of Norway, or to travel in other lands?" 
               The girl shook her head. 
               "No, not now," she said; "perhaps, some day, when my grandfather shall no longer keep the light-house, and I am married; but I like not the towns. It is to the country I shall like to go with my husband." 
               "With your husband? Then you are soon to be married, pretty Louise?" 
               "No-I know not that; but some day, I suppose. It is so with all." 
               The young man smiled at the unsophisticated remark, and the naivet with which it was uttered. Such a remark made to a stranger, by any one of the females whom he had heretofore met, would have savored of boldness and indelicacy; uttered by Louise, in the simplicity of innocence, it was quite otherwise: it betrayed only the purity of her thoughts 
               "Your short summer," observed the young man, "must afford you but little opportunity to take the walks you have spoken of; the weather, even in summer, is often stormy, I have heard." 
               "Yes, often; but when the storm is not too violent, it is then I like to wander on the cliffs and look at the sea, and when it is fine, then I work in my garden or walk in the valley, or sit beneath the shade of the pine groves." 
               "I see," interrupted the youth, "that some of those boats are coming on shore with the booty they have gleaned. I will leave you, Louise, and go down to the pier; perhaps they may have found something belonging to me." 
               "Then I had better go with you if you wish to regain it," said the maiden; "to me they will give it, if I say so." 
               "And why not to me?" inquired the youth, with some surprise. "Your friends risked their own lives to save mine, last night. Surely they would not rob a shipwrecked man?" 
               "Not so they call it," returned the maiden. "They are brave and kind; but what the sea gives up they call their own; but come, we shall see." 
               They descended the slope together, and reached the little rough stone pier, just as the foremost boat had been brought alongside. In it were Rolf Frode and Hans Petersen, who had already commenced to unload the boat which contained no inconsiderable booty. 
               They looked displeased on seeing Louise in company with the stranger, but greeted her kindly, and then briefly congratulated the young man on his fortunate escape. 
               Three or four more boats now reached the wharf, and the crews, among whom was Erik Lodbrok, began to discharge their lading. 
               Louise informed her companion that the three young men, Erik, Rolf, and Hans, were those to whose courage and skill he was indebted for his preservation. 
               The young man warmly thanked the fishermen, extending to each of them his hand. They each shook hands with him, at the same time observing that they had done no more for him than they would have done for any one in like peril; but while they spoke the words, the glances of indignation and vexation they cast toward him, as they saw him again approach Louise, seemed to express the thought that they would have been as well satisfied if he had been left to his fate. 
               "Ha!" exclaimed the young man, as Erik Lodbrok landed-with the assistance of a companion-a large chest from his boat, "I was in hopes I should find something; any thing is better than nothing. That chest belongs to me, my friend." 
               There was a general movement among the fishermen, who were all sufficiently acquainted with English to understand the words of the young stranger. Each looked at the other, and then turned a threatening glance at the speaker, who, not perceiving their indignant looks, or disregarding them, had already advanced to take possession of his property. 
               "It is mine; I claim it," said Erik, pushing the youth aside. "What the sea gives up is ours." 
               This speech was generally responded to by his companions. 
               "You should be thankful for your life," observed Hans Peterson; "but for us you would now have been food for fishes. Go, go back to the light-house and leave to us that which God has given us." 
               "I insist upon taking my own property," returned the youth, who by this time had seated himself upon the chest. "It is but a small remnant of the property I had on board the ship, and the chest contains things of absolute necessity to me." 
               It was evident that only a portion of the young man's words were understood, yet a sufficiency was comprehended to enable the islanders to make out their general tenor. 
               "How do we know," demanded Hans, fiercely, "that what you claim is your own? You may easily lay claim to all, there are none to gainsay you." 
               "Do you dare to intimate that I tell a falsehood, and claim what does not belong to me?" replied the youth, haughtily. "If there be justice in Norway, I will have my own. Have none of you the honesty to stand by me and acknowledge the justice of my demands?" He looked round to see if any one would take his part; but receiving no satisfactory reply, and believing that his demands would not be acceded to, he addressed himself especially to Rolf Frode, who chanced to be standing near him. 
               "You, my honest fellow," he said, "was, as I have been informed, foremost among those who last night ventured out to sea to rescue me. I ask but for this one chest. If any thing else of mine is saved, you can keep it. Nor will I interfere with any other property that has been, or may be brought on shore, though I could recognize much that I see, and inform the friends of my lost shipmates that it has been saved from the wreck." 
               Rolf hesitated for a few moments, but made no reply, and presently joined his companions who had congregated together, and were engaged in earnest and boisterous conversation in their own language. In another moment Erik and his fellow-boatman stepped out from the group and advanced toward the chest, evidently with the intention of carrying it off. 
               "Nay, then!" exclaimed the young man, passionately, "if this be the hospitality of the Norsemen; if you have saved my life only to rob me, before my eyes, of the little the storm has spared me, you shall take the life you have saved before I will give up my property." 
               Thus speaking, he seized a boat-hook which lay near by, and springing upon the chest, awaited the anticipated attack of the fishermen. 
               Erik and his companions each armed themselves in like manner, and were on the point of rushing upon him, when Louise, who had not yet spoken, advanced toward the young men. 
               "Shame, shame, Erik!" she cried, "and you Hans and Rolf! I did not expect this from you;" and she looked earnestly at the latter. "Last night you nobly risked your own lives to save a shipwrecked fellow-creature. You, Hans, at my request," and she directed her gaze toward Hans, "and now you would rob him before his eyes! This must not be, or you are welcome at the light-house no more." 
                
               She had spoken in Norsk, and of course her words were unintelligible to Henry Harcourt; but he knew that she was interceding in his behalf. He stayed his threatening attitude and awaited the result of her intercession. 
               Hans and Rolf exchanged a few words, and then advanced together toward Erik, and conferred with him. 
               Erik was evidently unwilling to give up his prize. The very anxiety to possess it, shown by the young man who claimed to be its owner, enhanced the value of it in his eyes; but he was at length over-persuaded by his comrades, and, ungraciously enough, the chest was given into the possession of the young Englishman. 
               "Now, Rolf," said Louise, "you must help Herr Henry to carry the chest up to the light-house," and, somewhat sulkily, but without speaking a word, Rolf complied with her demand. 
               Arrived at the light-house, the young fisherman placed the chest at the door of the cabin, and after speaking with Louise for a few minutes, hastened back to rejoin his comrades, apparently in a more amiable humor than when he had left them. 
               "Now, Herr Henry, I have my duties to attend to," said Louise, after having assisted the young man to carry the rescued chest into the cottage. You must amuse yourself as you can till dinner time, when I shall again see you." 
               In the course of the forenoon, the light-house keeper informed the youth that a boat would leave Sartaroe for Bergen on the following day, and if he had any letters to send to Bergen or Christiansund he had better prepare them, "though," said the old man, "I know not where you can find pens and paper, unless Louise has them, for we use such materials but seldom here. Few among us know how to use them." 
               "I have all that is necessary in this chest," replied the youth, "unless the sea water has got in and spoiled its contents; but I must force the lid and see, for I have lost my keys." 
               It is to be supposed that the necessary materials were found in a condition fit for use, since, on the next morning, Henry Harcourt placed two letters in the hands of the light-house keeper, to be dispatched to Bergen-one of which read as follows: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "Sataroe Island, May --. 
                              "MY DEAR CHARLES,
                            
                           "You will be surprised to receive this letter. I suppose that not more than a week has elapsed since you received my former letter advising you of my resolve to visit Christiansund, and join you in the fishing and hunting excursions, which, in your last letter to me, you described so vividly. The very difficulties and dangers of which you wrote only urged me the more forcibly to hasten the resolve which I so suddenly formed. 
                           "I knew that, misanthrope as I am, ennuye with every thing, blas before my time, sick of life before the down has grown upon my chin, I should find a welcome with you. The magnificent scenery you described in your letter excited my curiosity, too. You know that I spent a year among the Alps, until at length even Mont Blanc itself-stately 'monarch of mountains,' as it is-lost interest in my eyes; and as to Italy and Germany, I have long palled of them. As to France-bah! I am heartily tired of fashion and of frivolity; and England-my native land-has no charms for me. When I received your letter, I was thinking of going to America and testing the virtues of a tour among the forests and prairies of the West that we have talked of together so often. But I resolved to try Norway first, and here in Norway, or at least on one of the islands which form its outer coast, I am, though I did not arrive here in the manner I intended; but of that presently. 
                           "You asked me in your last letter, how it came to pass that I-a young man of twenty two, with what people term 'excellent expectations, and five hundred pounds a year, now, to spend as I please-should have become almost weary of life before I have advanced beyond its portals? I can not reply, unless less the cause be that I have been disappointed, or, as you will say, have fancied myself disappointed, in every thing that I have undertaken or that I have had an inclination for. 
                           "No one understands me, Charley, or I do not understand myself. My father allowed me to do as I pleased, and that was all. He thought with that permission I ought to have been satisfied. I was not. I wanted some restraint. I desired other companionship than that I met with in my father's house. My mother-I love her; yet she thinks I care not for her. All her affection is centered in my sister, and me she treats as an alien. She does not know this, perhaps, herself, but I feel it, and that is enough. My uncle Templeton misunderstands my disposition. He thinks me averse to study, careless, reckless, and unprincipled-and I do not care to undeceive him. He refused me permission to enter the army, where at least for a few years I might have been satisfied, and wished me. To study law! Good heavens, to set myself down to study musty books, each authority contradicting the other, and the only object of all being to set mankind by the ears. No, no, my dear Charley, I have a full and perfect recollection of reynard's division of the oyster. No law for me! Then he would have had me settle down at once in my native country, as a country squire, before my time. Again, no. Time enough for that, when I "come into my property," as they say, which I suppose I shall do in a few years if I live. They say that I, unnatural being they think me at my age, dislike women. The truth is, I esteem them so highly that I can find no woman who comes up to my standard of womanly perfection. 
                           "I was accustomed in my boyhood to hear women lightly spoken of, and I, young reprobate as I was, thoughtlessly joined in the jests passed around at their expense, and was laughed at when I ought to have been whipped and sent to bed; but this levity, which was but a mere freak of boyhood, passed away as I grew toward manhood, and left me as I am. It would perhaps have been better if I had been in earnest, and remained so. 
                            
                           "You, and you alone, Charley, know how I was deceived at Florence. How I was mistaken in the character of one in whom I fancied I had found the perfection I sought. No one else knows what induced me to return to the continent, after three years of travel and of absence from England. Deceived as I was, I could not absent myself from her. Four different times I visited Florence-saw her, yet never spoke to her, nor even sought an introduction, after I bade her farewell the first and last time; and still I preserve the letters she wrote me when I fancied I had found her all that I sought in woman. 
                           "This brings me to explain how it is that I write you from this rock. I sailed from Hamburg on board the Jung Frau, bound to Bergen and Christiansund, the very day week after I wrote you the letter which announced my intention to visit Norway. We had a favorable passage until we neared the Norwegian coast, when the weather became unsettled and squally. The sun was not visible for three days, and the captain-who I believe was incompetent to fill the position he held-lost his reckoning; the result was that when we thought we were steering in a direction that would enable us to clear the northern extremity of Sartaroe, we were actually heading directly toward the southern extremity of the island. A storm suddenly arose, and last night the ship was wrecked upon a ledge of rocks, scarce a hundred yards distant from the point on which Sartaroe light-house stands. Every soul was lost excepting myself, and I was rescued only through the exertions of some fishermen who put to sea, as I have been informed, in the height of the gale and picked me up. I have lost every thing but one chest which contains my writing-desk and Clara's letters. This was picked up this morning by the boatmen, and I obtained possession of it, though the effort was well-nigh costing me a broken head. 
                           "It is fortunate that I brought no money with me, with the exception of a few pounds, which I have lost. I procured a letter of credit from a banker in Hamburg, which is also lost; but that is a matter of trifling consequence, as I can easily obtain another; meanwhile I have written to the British vice-consul at Bergen, giving the particulars of my destitute condition and asking for a temporary loan. I shall not, however, continue my journey to Christiansund until I hear from you, so write and send me some money as soon as possible. 
                           "I shall visit Bergen and write thence to my banker in Hamburg for a new letter of credit. 
                           "By the way, I have a somewhat romantic story to relate. Although my life was saved by the fishermen of the island, they ventured to my rescue only through the exertions of a young woman, who is one of the loveliest and most artless and innocent creatures I ever saw. I am half in love with her already, though I have not spent an hour in her society. If she were well educated she would realize my conceptions of perfect womanhood: how such a flower of loveliness came to grow on this barren soil I can not conceive! but, a ira; if she were educated and inducted into the follies and fripperies of fashion, she would probably become as false as the rest of her sex. 
                           "I have known but one woman, Charley, who did understand me, and she was Mrs. Jenkins, my father's housekeeper. She is now with my uncle in the United States, where, by-the-by, my mother is thinking of going to pay her brother a visit, which she intimates to me may prove a prolonged one. I did not acquaint my friends that I was about to embark on board the Jung Frau, for Christiansund; but I must write as soon as possible, or they may hear of the loss of the vessel, and perchance hear that I have perished with the unfortunate crew. 
                           "I don't know what the postal arrangements are in this country; but I shall await your letter, in reply to this, with impatience; so write as soon as possible.

               This letter dispatched to Bergen, together with that which the young man had written to the vice-consul, he made up his mind to wait with the greatest degree of patience he could call to his aid, for the expected answers, and mean while, by way of affording himself amusement, resolved to cultivate his singularly-formed acquaintance with the maid of the light-house. Here we will leave him for the present, while we return to the United States, and afford the reader a glimpse of the proceedings at the house of Mr. John Templeton, on the banks of the Hudson, whom we left in a somewhat perturbed state of mind at the conclusion of a preceding chapter. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VII. 
               THE UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL LEADS TO THE INFERENCE THAT HAMLET'S PHILOSOPHY WAS NOT FAR WRONG. 
               FOR the first time since he had retired from the cares of business, and returned to his native land to spend the remainder of his life in the dolce far niente of a country life on the banks of one of the most beautiful of rivers, Mr. John Templeton's slumbers were visited by unpleasant dreams. He dreamed that the books, and statuettes, and pictures, were removed from his library, which was suddenly transformed into a perfumer's shop, the book-cases filled with perfumes and pomades. If he sought refuge from this in another apartment, his position was not improved. He had but changed the magazin of the perfumer for that of the modiste. He called up his old servants and demanded the reason why this trumpery occupied his rooms. It was a strange servant who answered his call, and when he asked for the old housekeeper, he was told that the ladies who had come to reside at his house had brought their own domestics with them, and discharged the old servants. Presently a host of dry-goods clerks and jewelers, and trades people of every description appeared, and presenting their bills, clamorously demanded immediate payment. He glanced over the accounts and at the sum total. It amounted to more than a year's income. Frantic with rage he refused to satisfy their demands, and rushing down stairs, seized his hat, with the intention of proceeding immediately to New York, in order to consult with his lawyer. Horror of horrors! the two-cedar trees which ornamented the lawn in front of the house, and which were his especial pride, had been cut down, and in the place of them appeared two clothed wax figures, attired in the very extreme of fashion, and spinning round in the breeze, their grinning faces appearing to mock him, as they eyed him all over in the performance of each evolution. This was too much to be quietly endured. He advanced to one of the figures and kicked it violently, and awoke in an agony of pain. He had broken his great toe-nail against the foot-board of his bed! His glance fell upon the French clock on the mantel-piece. The hands pointed to seven o'clock. 
               "God bless me!" he exclaimed, springing out of bed. "Twenty minutes too late in getting into bed, and an hour and twenty minutes too late in waking! If it were not that I charge this irregularity to the news I received yesterday, I should begin to be alarmed. I should, indeed." 
               Regular to the minute in every thing, Mr. John Templeton had assumed the theory that every man who wishes to preserve his health requires exactly seven hours' sleep, and ought always to be dressed and out of his bedroom one hour before breakfast. For this reason but always retired to his bedroom at ten o'clock at night; spent forty minutes in his devotions and in undressing, and getting into bed at twenty 'minutes to eleven, slept until twenty minutes to six, when he woke as regularly as the clock pointed to the hour and minute. Thus allowing himself twenty minutes to dress and shave, and an hour to walk, or to work in the garden before breakfast. 
               He had scarcely completed his hurried toilette when there came a tap at the bedroom door. He opened it himself, and confronted Mrs. Jenkins standing in the passage: 
               "Dear me, sir," exclaimed the old lady, "really I am glad to see you well. I was getting quite frightened. Breakfast has been on the table a quarter of an hour. Thomas has been hunting for you all over the grounds, and couldn't find you; and, at last, I thought I would take the liberty of coming to your bedroom door myself, fearing that you might be unwell." 
                
               "No, thank you, Mrs. Jenkins," replied Mr. Templeton, "I am quite well; but somehow or other I overslept myself. Breakfast is ready, you say? I will take breakfast at once." He proceeded, limping, down stairs. 
               "Dear me, sir," exclaimed the housekeeper, "you walk quite lame. I hope you are not going to have an attack of the gout." 
               "The gout! Mrs. Jenkins? No, I should think not. You know I never had sign or symptom of the disease in my life. I have hurt my foot somehow or other against the foot-board of the bed. It is nothing, and will be well by to-morrow." 
               Mrs. Jenkins shook her head, but made no reply. It was evident that she doubted the story of the foot-board, and coupling the fact of her master's lameness with his unwonted late hour of rising, believed that he really had a faint attack of the gout. 
               "The gardener has been over to the village this morning sir," she said, as Mr. Templeton entered the breakfast-parlor, "and has brought a letter which arrived at the post-office, from New York, yesterday. It is on the table." 
               Thus saying, she quitted the room. 
               Mr. Templeton took the letter from the table, and with some misgiving, examined the post-mark. It had been originally posted in New York. Impatiently he broke the seal, and read as follows: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "City Hotel, New York, March --. 
                              "MY DEAR BROTHER,
                            
                           "After making an exceedingly rapid passage from London in the ship John Franklin, I arrived in this port, with my daughter Alice, this morning-a full fortnight, at least, before I anticipated that pleasure. 
                           "I shall look for you in New York by next Saturday, as I presume you will start from home to meet us here, immediately upon the receipt of this letter. Alice and I have enjoyed the trip amazingly. I had no idea that I should prove so good a sailor; but then the weather was very fine, and the captain very attentive. 
                           "I shall write no more at present, as I expect shortly to see you here, and to accompany you to your own home. 
                           
                              "Your affectionate sister, 
                              "ALICE HARCOURT.
                            
                         
                         
                           "P. S. Your niece sends her love, and is all impatience to set you. 
                           "P. P. S. I re-open my letter to hint to you-being a single man, and unaccustomed to the companionship of ladies for so many years, you may forget to take the necessary precautions-to hint, that it would be advisable for you to leave directions with your housekeeper-good old Jenkins, she, I presume, is still in your service-to see that the sheets of the beds she will provide for myself and daughter are well aired, as both of us take cold very readily, and nothing is so dangerous as sleeping between damp sheets. Also, beg Mrs. Jenkins to prepare for me, if she will be so good, a suit of night-clothes and a night-cap, since, as I purpose leaving New York immediately you arrive to escort us to your home, I shall not uncord my trunks; but will make the clothing which I wore on board ship serve for the present. 
                           
                              A. H."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               "I dreaded as much," muttered Mr. Templeton, when he had perused and laid aside the letter. "I had a foreboding. I didn't lay awake one half the night, and have the nightmare the other half, for nothing. Aired sheets and night-caps! Hint to Mrs. Jenkins! I knew how it would be-Mrs. Jenkins here, and Mrs. Jenkins there, before even they have arrived at the villa. As if Mrs. Jenkins didn't know of her own accord what it is necessary to provide for my guests!" 
               Mr. Templeton now sat down to breakfast. The eggs were hard and cold; the toast tough, and the coffee had boiled over and lost its aroma; and with all this, Mr. Templeton had lost his appetite, even for the most tempting breakfast, in consequence of not having taken his regular morning walk. 
               The breakfast remained almost untasted, and after making several ineffectual attempts to swallow something, he summoned the man-servant. 
               "Thomas," said he, when that functionary appeared, "get the wagon ready and bring it round to the door, and tell the boy to clean my boots and brush my overcoat, directly. I want you to drive me over to Failing's. We must be at the tavern by eleven o'clock. I want to take the stage for New York, which leaves at that hour." 
               "Yes, sir," answered the man, with some surprise at what he considered the sudden whim of his master, depicted in his countenance. 
               "And, Thomas," continued Mr. Templeton, as the man was leaving the room, "request Mrs. Jenkins to step up stairs." 
               "Yes, sir," and the man departed on his errand. 
               In a few minutes Mrs. Jenkins made her appearance. 
               "Mrs. Jenkins," said Mr. Templeton, "my sister and niece have arrived in New York already-confound those fast-sailing packets!-and they have sent to request me to meet them there. I am off to the city immediately; and, Mrs. Jenkins, what rooms do you propose to put them in?" 
               "Both ladies will, I suppose, occupy the same bedroom, sir?" 
               "I don't know, I'm sure. Alice, my niece, is seventeen-quite a young woman. Is it usual for ladies to occupy the same bedroom? You know better than I, Mrs. Jenkins." 
               "Yes, sir-at least for one night I should think no objection would be made. I suppose I had better arrange the spare front bedroom, over the parlor, for their reception." 
               "Just as you think most advisable, Mrs. Jenkins. There is no time to lose. The stage leaves Failing's tavern at eleven o'clock, and Thomas has ten miles to drive." And Mr. Templeton pleton limped out of the room to ascend to his bedroom to prepare for the unexpected journey. 
               "God bless me!" he exclaimed, as he reached the first landing, "I quite forgot the night-caps, Mrs. Jenkins," he bawled out to that lady, "Mrs. Harcourt writes that she is particular about her sheets being well aired. You may expect us back on Monday. Please to see to it; and to provide night-caps, Mrs. Jenkins, and night-I mean," added the gentleman, after a pause, occasioned by a sudden suspicion arising in his mind that he was touching upon delicate ground; "I mean the-the various paraphernalia of the sleeping apartments. My sister and niece will probably not unpack their trunks till they arrive here. Will you be good enough to provide all that is necessary? I suppose the young lady will need a night-cap-and the-the other materials, also." 
               "I will see that every thing is properly arranged, sir," answered the housekeeper; and the old bachelor ascended to his bedroom. 
               "Dear, dear!" exclaimed Mrs. Jenkins, "I am afraid this business will drive Mr. Templeton crazy. What nonsense he has been talking, as if I didn't know what was necessary for the accommodation and comfort of his visitors? and, I declare"-looking at the break-fast-table-"he hasn't eaten a mouthful of breakfast! And then that lame foot! He's got the gout at last"-Mrs. Jenkins was a firm believer that the gout, sooner or later, was a necessary evil to be borne by well-to-do gentlemen, who had passed the meridian of life-"and just as the first symptom of the attack make its appearance, these people must come over from England to plague and bother him, poor man! And then, only to think, to hurry him off to New York, such weather as this, with the snow a foot deep on the ground. He'll catch his death of cold. It's a burning shame! I 'm afraid there'll be no more peace and quiet in the house now." 
               While the good housekeeper had been thus apostrophizing, the boy had carried up stairs his master's boots; but, to the dismay of the old bachelor, his right foot was so sore that he found it quite impossible to draw on the boot, and after making several ineffectual efforts he was obliged to throw it aside and content himself with wearing a slipper on his right foot, over two pair of worsted stockings. 
               Thomas soon had the wagon ready at the door, and bidding a hasty good-by to the housekeeper, Mr. Templeton limped down the steps, leaning on the shoulder of the servant, and was assisted into the vehicle, which was immediately driven off. 
               "Ah!" sighed Mrs. Jenkins, as she noticed the slippered foot and the more decided limp of the old bachelor. 
               It was late in the evening when the stage arrived in New York. It stopped at the stage-office, and Mr. Templeton immediately hired a carriage, and proceeded to the New York Hotel. 
               Mrs. Harcourt and her daughter were expecting his arrival, and he was immediately shown by a waiter to their room. 
               Mr. Templeton had visited his sister shortly before he quitted England, therefore no long period had elapsed since they had seen each other; but notwithstanding they entertained toward each other a strong affection, they had met so seldom since the marriage of Alice Templeton with the heir of Harcourt Hall, that it had become quite a thing of course to live apart. They corresponded with each other; but neither yearned for the other's companionship, and with this state of things they would have rested content until one or the other passed into the grave, had it not been for the whim which had suddenly prompted Mrs. Harcourt to visit the United States: for in these eccentric movements from one place to another, without reason or design-a characteristic peculiar to the family-she resembled her brother, and in this respect alone. 
               The interview, therefore, was marked by no display of intense feeling. It was more like the accidental meeting of two old friends in a distant land, than that of an only brother and sister. 
               Mr. Templeton displayed more feeling when his niece was called down stairs by her mother, and introduced to him. She was at school when he had last visited her mother, and he had not seen her since the death of her father. Little Alice, as he fondly called her-though she had grown to be nearly as tall as himself-had not disappointed the expectations held forth by her girlish beauty, seven years before. She was not only beautiful in face and form, but she likewise possessed an intellectual beauty which lighted up her features, and doubly enhanced the mere physical perfection which even the most envious of her sex could not deny that she possessed. 
               Yet there was a painful impression produced on the mind as we gazed upon her. Alice impressed even the most casual observer, at first sight, with the idea that she was not long for this world; that she was one of those beautiful beings rarely to be seen, who seem to be sent among us like angels, "few and far between," to show to what perfection mankind may reach here, and to what a degree of perfection they may aspire in a future world. 
               Mr. Templeton was enchanted with the appearance of his niece. He would have been well satisfied, notwithstanding his love for his sister, that all their future communication should have been in the way of mutual correspondence, but he felt that he could take his niece to his heart and his home, and that she was one who would render any home a paradise of delight. 
               He felt that even Mrs. Jenkins, with all her jealousy of household dominance, must love this fair young creature, and before he had been in her company an hour, he had quite forgotten the ill-humor which had clung to him since the hour in which he had received the letter announcing the intelligence of his sister's anticipated visit. 
               "Dear me, John! surely you have not got the gout?" said Mrs. Harcourt who, after the first greetings were over, noticed the slippered foot of her brother. "The gout is hereditary with the Harcourts, but I never knew that it had attacked the Templetons." 
               "No, Alice," responded Mr. Templeton, "this is no attack of the gout. I met with a trifling accident, and hurt my foot this morning. I could not pull on my boot when hurrying off to New York, in obedience to your mandate, and so I had to content myself to travel en invalide. It will be well in a day or two." 
               "John," said Mrs. Harcourt, "are you not deceiving me? Are you sure you have not got the premonitory symptoms of gout?" 
               "Quite sure," replied Mr. Templeton. "Never had the slightest symptoms of the gout in my life. None of our family, as you say, ever had it." 
               Yet Mr. John Templeton had been asked so often whether he was not afflicted with gout by his housekeeper, by the passengers in the stage, and by his sister, that he began to fear that such was the case, and that the fancy of having kicked his foot against the foot-board of the bedstead, was a mere freak of the imagination; and so powerful is the force of imagination, that it is quite possible that the disease might actually have attacked him, fostered by doubt and apprehension, had not a good night's rest refreshed his frame, wearied out by unwanted exertion, and so reduced the swelling, and alleviated the pain in his nether limb, that he had with him the boot he had left behind, he could have drawn it on with ease. 
               It was Saturday evening when Mr. Templeton arrived in New York. He remained in the city over the Sabbath, and reached his home, as he had anticipated, on the Monday evening. 
               "What a sweet place, brother." 
               "What a delightful spot, dear uncle!" were the simultaneous expressions of Mrs. Harcourt and her daughter, when about six o'clock in the evening, a sudden bend in the road, leading the stage along the bank of the river, opened to their view the villa belonging to Mr. Templeton, which he pointed out to his companions, with pardonable pride, as one of the chief beauties in the lovely landscape before them. 
               "We shall soon be there, uncle?" said Alice, interrogatively. 
               "No, my dear," was the reply, "we have a long drive before us after we alight from the stage. It will leave us about four miles above this, and, as you may perceive, my residence is on the other bank of the river. We have a ten miles' drive after we leave the stage." 
               "Even that, tired as I am. I am not sorry for," returned the young lady, "if the road conveys us through such exquisite scenery as that amid which we have been whirling for the last hour." 
               "I think you will acknowledge that it does," replied Mr. Templeton. 
               In the course of another hour the stage arrived at Failing's Tavern. Thomas was there in waiting, with his master's close carriage, to which the party immediately transferred themselves, and in two hours more they arrived at the village, having crossed the river at Troy in the horse ferry-boat, to the delight and astonishment of Alice. 
               Mrs. Jenkins, in anticipation of the arrival of the party, had provided every thing for their accommodation. After partaking of a hot supper, they soon retired for the night-for they were wearied with their long journey-and thus far all promised happily for the future peace and quiet of the house, which had been threatened by the advent of the strangers. 
               Even Mrs. Jenkins was impressed with the grace and gentleness of Alice. She had a woman's heart, and in the lovely girl, just blushing into womanhood, she recognized the feeble infant whom she had often dandled in her arms, and the little, blue-eyed child to whom she had taught the alphabet, and whom she had often charmed to sleep with fairy tales. And now we will leave the weary travelers to their slumbers, while we return to the history of other personages who have figured in my narrative. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VIII. 
               CHARLEY STAYNOR. 
               IT is generally conceded that novelists, like poets, are privileged personages, who, without prejudice, can transport their readers hither and thither at will, wheresover they list, as may best suit the development of their narrative. We shall therefore offer no further apology for temporarily changing the scene and reverting to an earlier date than that of the immediately preceding chapters. 
               It was the period of the carnival at Florence, in Italy, just four years after the death of Mr. William Harcourt, and one year after Henry Harcourt had commenced his travels, when two young gentlemen alighted from a carriage at the door of one of the principal hotels of that far-famed city. 
               The elder of the two seemed to be an old traveler and well acquainted with the place, and to have been a guest at the hotel at some former period. He addressed the waiters by name, and to judge from the deference paid to him and the promptitude with which he was waited upon, he was one accustomed to spend his money freely. He might have numbered twenty-five years; perhaps he was a year or two younger, for his black, curly hair, and swarthy complexion, and tall, stout, athletic frame, were calculated to make him appear older than he really was. That he was an accustomed traveler was apparent not only from his sun-burnt features, but from the compact form in which his somewhat scanty baggage was packed, and from his dress, which, so far as could be seen, consisted of a linen blouse, belted at the waist, a low-crowned, broad-brimmed felt hat, stout shoes, and gaiter leggings-a suit of outer clothing which defied the attacks of sun and dust, both apt to be unpleasant concomitants of travel in Italy. His companion was a youth of nineteen or twenty years. He was similarly attired as regarded his outer clothing, but his fair complexion, untanned by sun or wind, betrayed the fact that he was not an accustomed traveler. 
               "Now, Niccolo, up with my baggage and that of this young signore, to my old rooms," said the elder of the two gentlemen, addressing a porter in Italian; "and Maurice; where's Maurice?" 
               "Ecce, signore," exclaimed a smartly-dressed waiter. "Ha! Signore Carlo," he continued, recognizing the young man's features, and grinning with delight at seeing him. "Welcome back to Florence. What does your excellency need?" 
               "My excellency needs something to eat, in the first place. You know my old room, Maurice; send up something-any thing you have ready at hand-for myself and this young gentleman-and, Maurice, a bottle of good wine. Do you hear?" 
               "Si, signore, your excellency's wants shall be attended to promptly," replied the waiter, bowing, and proceeding to acquit himself of his errand. 
               "Now, Harcourt," said the young man, addressing his more youthful companion, "let me act as master of ceremonies; follow me up stairs to the fourth story, and let me show you the lodgings I have provided. High up, but airy; cheap enough, and so much the better, as it leaves one more money to spend, wherewith to purchase the favors of the servants-and let me tell you, you'll find that very necessary. A few pauls per week, scattered among the waiters, and saved out of the rent of the room-a cheap lodging in a first-rate hotel, for the sake of appearances-and you have the true domestic economy of travel. Here we are; here's the room-two beds in it, you see, two chairs, and a wash-stand. Every thing that's necessary in Florence, where one lives out of doors, or in the picture-galleries leries and studios, and dines at a salle  manger. And here comes Niccolo with our luggage. That trunk, there, Niccolo, and the knapsack-put that beside it," he continued, changing his language to Italian, and speaking to the porter; "and that valise and trunk by the further bed-so. Here, Niccolo-here's something for your trouble," tossing a couple of pauls to the porter. "And now, Harry," again addressing his companion, "confess that we are comfortably situated." 
               "Oh, yes," replied the youth, "any thing will satisfy me, Staynor." 
               "Any thing will satisfy you! As if I had not provided accommodations fit for a prince, at about one tenth the price you were paying in Paris, when I, luckily for yourself, chanced to fall in with you." 
               "I was as glad to meet you, as you could have been to meet me," returned the youth. 
               "No doubt of that Harry. You had reason-moped up, as you were, in the Rue Richelieu, with that horrid bore of a traveling companion your sapient uncle provided you with. Come here to the window, you haven't seen a quarter of the advantages of a lofty apartment yet. See there to the right-that's the Piazza Gran' Ducale-with the arcades, and the marble fountains, and the equestrian statue in the centre. That's the largest square in Florence, but not the handsomest, to my mind. I prefer the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio; you can see the top of the column, which stands in its center, further off to the left; and there's the Ponte Vecchio, and the Palazzos Vecchio, and Pitti. We can see half over Florence from this window. I wonder what your traveling companion, or tutor, or whatever you call him, is doing now. Will he inform your guardian of the French leave you have taken, I wonder?" 
               "I care not whether he does or not," replied the youth; "although I suspect Mr. Wilson is glad enough to get rid of me, and to pursue his own course, at my uncle's expense. So I presume that, for his own sake, he will remain silent, so long as I do. He wanted to travel on the Continent after his own fashion, and he was too poor to do so without accepting an engagement as traveling companion." 
               Maurice, the waiter, now appeared, bearing a tray, upon which were some maccaroni cakes and a bottle of wine, and glasses. 
               "Thank you, Maurice-thank you," said Staynor. "Now, Harry, break bread, and eat; this will stay your appetite till dinner time, when we will adjourn to the salle  manger." 
               "Not in this costume?" said Henry, glancing at his blouse. 
               "Per Baccho! No. We must brush up after we have drank our wine. We shall have time to take a walk in the Cascine before the dinner hour, and then you must look your best, Harry. I don't know who we have here now. It's six months since I left; but lots of people whom I know, I venture to say, and some whom you have met at your father's house at home, I shouldn't wonder." 
               "I hope not," replied Harcourt; "I am weary of such people-horses, dogs, and the dice-box, are all they think of." 
               "Horses and dogs are very good things in their way," replied Staynor; "but I agree with you in regard to the dice-box. I have managed to steer clear of that, in spite of innumuerable temptations; bad enough as I may be in some other respects. But, my dear fellow, you needn't know any body here unless you like, and if you wish, you, in your position, may know every body. You will find Florence an olla podrida of society-English nobles and ladies of rank-haughty and reserved save to a select few; but gentlemen and ladies, when you know them, and have obtained the entre to their salons. English parvenus, ridiculously proud of their wealth; tyrannical to those beneath them, but meanly subservient to those above them-bowing the knee before a title of nobility, whether it be to the genuine aristocracy of their own country, or the counterfeit article of France, Italy, and Germany. You will find blacklegs and ruined spendthrifts forcing themselves by some hocus-pocus into places whence, if their reputation was known, they would be ignominiously kicked out. You will find republican Americans, seemingly ashamed of their republicanism, vying with the veriest sycophants of European Society in their admiration of the aristocracy, and their love of titles; and others from the same land, almost perfect specimens of what ladies and gentlemen, and true republicans ought to be-and Harry, unless your heart is free, beware of the young American ladies, or you are a lost man. 'Fore George! Mohammed must have dreamed of them, when he peopled his paradise with Houris. You will find here, gray-haired and wrinkled wealth striving to ape the elasticity and buoyancy of youth, and to purchase with gold the smiles and favors they can lot otherwise obtain; and match-making mothers, to their shame be it said, ready to sacrifice their daughters at the shrine of Plutus. You will find Virtue and Vice so mixed up together, and the latter so artistically disguised, that, no matter how you abhor it, you will embrace it unawares, unless you are constantly upon your guard. And you will find that which alone makes the society of Florence endurable, after the first gloss of novelty has worn off-lovers of Art for its own sake-professional and amateur lovers of art, from every civilized country. It is the society of these, mostly young men like ourselves, that has made Florence a paradise of delight to me. They are, generally speaking, a cheerful, jovial set of fellows. Closely studious during the hours devoted to study, and ready at other times for any fun that offers. Often getting into scrapes, but readily getting out of them. Generally poor, but happy in their poverty because their hearts are yet unseared, and they look through the vista of the future toward the temple of Fame, instead of bowing down, in the present, before the shrine of Mammon. And there is one thing in Florence you will never grow wearied with, independent of its living society-the silent occupants of its galleries and palaces-the souls of the great masters of Art, who lived in days gone by, represented on the canvas, and in the marbles they have left as a heritage to mankind to prove the divinity of Genius. We shall visit some of these treasures of art to-morrow, Deo volente; but I have talked enough-doff your blouse and gaiters, and on with patent leathers, and a surtout, and let us to the Cascine for a stroll." 
               In half an hour the young men stood in the Cascine, gazing admiringly upon the brilliant "turn-outs" always to be found there in the afternoons; among which, of late years, the light and tasty vehicles common to the United States, and thence originating, are prominent objects of admiration. 
               After amusing themselves for awhile they returned to the hotel in time to join the guests in the salle  manger. Harcourt found, as his friend had told him he would, a strangely mixed society, and his being a new face-his friend appeared to be well-known-he received many overtures of friendship, which were repulsed by Staynor, who had constituted himself his Mentor. 
               The friendly relations these young men bore toward each other have been partially disclosed in the letter, in a preceding chapter, written by Harcourt to Charles Staynor, from Sartaroe. The following conversation which took place in their own room, to which they retired early, being both somewhat wearied with their long journey from Paris, will explain them more fully. 
               "We'll have a cigar and a glass of claret, and then turn in, Harry," observed Staynor, after the young men had uncorded their trunks and arranged their clothing for the morning. Let's enjoy an hour's quiet chat about old times. We've been traveling in such hot haste since we left Paris, that we've hardly had time to talk to each other. Strange, wasn't it, my falling in with you at Paris, so accidentally? I was intending to leave the city the evening of the day on which I arrived. Most people like Paris, I can't say I do. It's well enough the first time one visits it, but palls upon one afterward. At least it is so with me. It's too artificial." 
                
               "I was beginning to grow weary," replied Harcourt, "but I couldn't persuade Wilson to leave. He talked of remaining there during the winter." 
               "Let me see," said Staynor, "it must be five years since I left you at Eton. I am now twenty-four. I left Eton at nineteen." 
               "And went to Cambridge University," said Harcourt. 
               "Yes, and entered the Corpus Christi as a student; but I have not told you how I came to quit the university?" 
               "No." 
               "Well, then, here goes for my story; but before I begin I'll light another cigar. Hand me the allumetes, if you please. Thank you. Well, when I quitted Eton, I had no anticipation whatever of the good fortune which awaited me. I, like you, was under the control of a guardian, having lost both my parents when a mere child. Two hundred pounds a year was my sole heritage, and that was locked up from me until I should attain my majority. However, my guardian-'pon my soul I respect him, Harry-always behaved kindly to me. A portion of this income-the greater portion, I suspect, he expended upon my education, carefully laying aside the residue at interest, to increase my small patrimony. Two hundred pounds a year, though a sum not to be despised, is of course quite insufficient for independence. 
               "When I returned to my guardian after leaving Eton, he took me into his study, and closing the door, desired me to take a seat. He looked very serious, and I foresaw what was coming: 
               "'Charles,' he said, you are now nineteen years old. It is time that you thought of some profession. Have you ever thought the matter over? Though I needn't ask this, for of course, with a young man of your age, it must often have been a subject of cogitation.' I replied that I really had never given the subject a thought, and this was actually the truth, for you know I was always a sad, careless dog. 
                
               "The old gentleman looked still more serious. 
               "'I am sorry to hear you say this,' he said; 'you are aware that your patrimony of two hundred a year with, perhaps, a thousand pounds, which have accrued from the invested savings of your annual income since you have been under my guardianship, after deducting the expenses of your education, is altogether insufficient for your support as a gentleman, and I can do nothing for you, except in so far as my inflence in promoting your advancement in life may go. I have a large family of daughters to provide for.' 
               "I told the old gentleman that I was fully sensible of his kindness to me; that he had acted the part of a second father toward me, and that I could not expect to remain a burden upon him after I became of age. 
               "He was considerably mollified, for I believe my first careless answer had offended him; perhaps not without reason. I ought to have been ashamed of it. His features relaxed their stern expression, and he took my hand in his. 
               "'Charles Staynor,' said he, 'I loved your father. He was my dearest friend. For his sake, I have endeavored to enact the part of a father toward you; and, my boy, you may be thankful that I have not a son of my own. You say you have made choice of no profession. I have a proposition to make to you. 
               "'You shall go to Cambridge, and enter upon a course of study to fit yourself for holy orders. The living of Halford is in my gift. It is worth seven hundred pounds a year, and the present incumbent is an old man of seventy-six, and very infirm. He can not live long. Should he die before you complete your studies and have been ordained, I will reserve the living for you. Otherwise, I will use my influence with him to make you his curate, and, upon his death, you shall become rector of Halford.' 
               "Thus, you see, Harry, I was, like you, very nearly becoming a clergyman, for you told me your uncle wished you to study for the church, with this advantage on my side, I had a snug independent living, ready to my hand; but then, on the other hand, I had not your expectations. 
               "The church was not the profession I would have chosen of my own accord. I am a wild, reckless fellow; not given too much to regard the strict proprieties of life; but I always held the opinion that it was wrong to make a trade of religion, and that no one ought to study for the ministry, unless naturally disposed toward it, and led thereunto by other reasons than that of merely obtaining a comfortable and easy livelihood; but what could I say? It was a generous offer on the part of my guardian, for he would need to advance me money out of his own income to prosecute my studies at the university; indeed he offered so to do. I knew several clergymen who appeared to lead a happy, easy, jovial life, and, right or wrong, I accepted my guardian's offer. Harry, I could not resist the anticipated increase of a life income of two hundred pounds to nearly a thousand pounds a year. 
               "I went to Cambridge and remained there two years. I wanted but one week of my twenty-first birth-day, when, accompanied by a letter from my guardian, I received an official looking document, directed to me, in a peculiar cramped handwriting, which I did not recollect ever having seen before. 
               "I opened my guardian's letter first, and found therein a clew to the contents of the other. 
               "A cousin of my father's, who had gone to India when a young man, and who had been forgotten by the family-I, at any rate, had never known that I had such a relative-had died, leaving to my father, or to his direct heir, the bulk of his property, invested in the English funds, and amounting to two thousand pounds per annum. 
               "The official-looking letter was from a lawyer in London, and by him had been sent to my guardian to be delivered to me. It was merely a recapitulation, in legal phraseology, of the information conveyed in the letter from my guardian. 
                
               "That night I gave a grand entertainment to my fellow collegians, and, I am ashamed to say, retired to bed, for the first time in my life, in a state of intoxication. 
               "The next day I sat on the stool of repentance. I thought to myself how unfit I was for the sacred office to which I was aspiring, and resolved to give up the idea of entering upon the holy vocation. 
               "You will say this was the devil's argument. I studied for the church as long as I believed that, by becoming a clergyman, I should be comfortably provided for for life, and perceived my utter unfitness and unworthiness only when an independence was bequeathed me from another source. Well, perhaps, it was. I offer nothing in palliation of the fact. 
               "I omitted to mention, that my guardian had stated in his letter announcing this windfall from the cap of Fortunatus, that he advised me still to pursue my studies, and fit myself for the profession for which he had intended me. 'I would occupy,' he said, 'a position of the highest respectability in becoming a clergyman, and the seven hundred pounds per annum would still be a valuable addition to my income.' 
               "I perfectly agreed with the old gentleman in this last observation, but I did not choose to be hedged about with the close proprieties which I must necessarily and conscientiously observe, if I intended to fill the sacred office. I was fond of the theater; of hunting and shooting, of horses and dogs, of amusements of every description. I might have overcome these propensities, perhaps, in time; still I am afraid I should have made a very discontented, if not a very wicked and inefficient parson. 
               "I wrote to my guardian to this effect; declined remaining any longer at the university, and expressed my intention of traveling on the Continent for a series of years, until I grew tired of wandering, and got married, and settled down in life. 
               "The old gentleman was very indignant; but I persisted in following up the resolution I had formed, and we parted in anger. 
                
               "He made over to me, honestly and faithfully, an account of his stewardship. In a few weeks I had settled every thing relating to the legacy with my lawyer, and found myself with a thousand pounds in hand, and a clear income of two thousand two hundred pounds a year. 
               "I came abroad, and spent six months in Paris. I have been in Rome and Naples; twice, ere this, in Florence; traveled throughout Germany; returned to England, and revisited Paris-where I met you; here I am in Florence, and fate or chance will decide in what direction I shall next turn my footsteps. Voila mon histoire!" 
               "And, as yet, you have never thought of marriage?" said Harcourt. 
               "Non, mon ami; I have sometimes seen a pretty face and a fair form, which I have thought would grace a seat opposite to me in a snug parlor in a house of my own, when I should bring my bachelor days to a close; but the fancy was evanescent. I am too fond of my liberty yet, to settle down into a staid, country gentleman in England, and my income is not enough to allow me to make a figure in London. In a few few more years we shall see, if, by the way, any pretty girl will accept such a rough, tawny, uncouth fellow as I have grown to be, for love. I will not be accepted for money. But you, Harry-have you no thoughts that way? With your face and figure, and your property in anticipation, for by-and-by you will be a much richer man than I, you would have no difficulty in throwing the handkerchief where you listed, and choosing any fair lady for your sultana who might happen to please your fancy." 
               "No," replied Harcourt, "I have had little opportunity of mixing in the society of women. Female visitors never made their appearance in my father's house since I can recollect. My mother and sister, my only female relations, are almost strangers to me; and, to tell you the truth, Charles, I never feel at ease in the society of ladies, and yet I yearn for such society," he added, after a pause, and in a tone of melancholy. 
                
               "Pooh, pooh! my dear fellow, you must get over that nonsense; it's mere bashfulness," replied Staynor, yawning as he spoke, and tossing the end of his cigar out of the window. I know several families in this city who will be glad to become acquainted with you; but its near midnight, let's to bed. We have a tough day's work to do to-morrow. I shall drag you all round the city with me, so I hope you are a stout walker." 
               "Never fear that," answered Harcourt, as he commenced to prepare for bed. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER IX. 
               DISAPPOINTMENTS IN AN AFFAIR OF THE HEART. 
               IT is a story, and not a book of travels, or a history of Florence that we are writing, although the nature of our story has led us to wander, in imagination, and, as we hope, led the reader to bear us pleasant companionship into several different countries. 
               Florence has been frequently and fully described by tourists, and the civilized world is cognizant of the invaluable treasures of art which it contains. We shall, therefore, proceed with our narrative, only assuring the reader that Henry Harcourt freely acknowledged, after having visited the various galleries, and palaces, and studios, and other depositories of pictures and statues, that the glowing description of his friend and companion had not been overwrought. 
               Charles Staynor did not forget the promise he had made to introduce Henry into society. Indeed, as he himself had said, he found this no difficult matter to accomplish. A young man with an income of two thousand pounds a year, finds no difficulty in introducing into the "best society" another young man with "expectations" amounting to four or five times that income, either in Florence or any other city. 
               Among the heads of "respectable families," who, having marriageable daughters, were glad to append to their visiting list the names of any number of personable and "eligible" young men, was one Mrs. Withers, a widow lady, from the United States, who, accompanied by her son and four unmarried daughters, was "doing" the tour of Europe, and who, pleased with the society, and the climate, and the many other advantages of Florence, had hired a villa in the environs of the city with the intention of residing there for a term of years. 
               The husband of Mrs. Withers had been a very successful speculator in western lands, who had died about five years before the widow had set forth on her tour, leaving her the sole mistress of his wealth, which having been well invested, afforded her an ample income; but when the mother of a family has a son and four daughters to provide for, and to settle in life, it is natural that she should feel some anxiety on the subject, and quite as natural that young men of good moral character and otherwise eligible, should be received with friendship into the privacy of the domestic circle. 
               The friends were examining the pictures in the Corsini Gallery. They had taken a seat opposite a picture of the Madonna, said to have been the work of Michael Angelo. 
               "That face is beautiful, is it not?" said Charles; "but I can hardly credit the assertion that Michael Angelo was the painter." 
               "Why not?" asked his friend. 
               "Because the expression of the face, the contour of the head, are too refined-too delicate. Look around at those pictures which are known to have been the work of the great master. You can not fail to observe that the figures and faces of both Michael Angelo's men and women, possess physical and intellectual, rather than refined, or, if I may so express myself, saintly beauty, even when a saintly character is represented." 
               "Therefore the more true to nature," replied Harcourt. 
               "How do you mean?" 
               "That a saintly expression, whether in man or woman, conceals hypocrisy. Angelo knew this, and would not transfer hypocrisy to his canvas." 
               "Bah! Harry; you young misanthrope! to speak thus of women at your time of life. Why, I have introduced you to ladies in this city, and within a few days past, whom I truly believe' to be the angels they appear." 
               Harcourt smiled contemptuously, and his friend resumed. 
               "What do you think of Miss Withers, the young American belle, with whom you danced last night?" 
               "Which Miss Withers? I was introduced to four of them, and danced with two." 
               It was Staynor's turn to smile. 
               "The youngest; Miss Clara Withers, the lady whom you twice danced with, and with whom, woman-hater as you pretend to be, you conversed during the greater portion of the evening." 
               "She is pretty; but she is yet a mere girl. The artlessness and gentleness she now appears to possess, will wear away as she grows older." 
               "She is nearly, if not quite, as old as you, you cynic," replied Staynor. "By the way, the face of the Madonna we have been looking at seems to me to resemble her very much." 
               "Do you think so?" said Harcourt. "The same fancy struck me; but I thought you would laugh at me if I said so." 
               "Why laugh at you, Harry?" said Staynor, smiling at the idea. "You are as sensitive and bashful as a girl, with all your pretended cynicism. Harry, you must go more into society, into the society of ladies, and you will get over this nonsense." 
               They had passed on to the further end of the gallery, and Staynor was about to return through another passage, when Harcourt, with apparent carelessness, but evident purpose, led him again toward the Madonna. 
               "It does indeed resemble Miss Clara Withers," said he, again seating himself opposite the picture. 
               "And here comes the fair lady herself," said Staynor. "We shall have an opportunity of comparing the two faces;" and Harcourt, turning his head, saw Mrs. Withers, accompanied by her daughters, advancing toward them. 
               The young men rose, and saluted the party. 
               "We were admiring this Madonna, Mrs. Withers," said Staynor, and then addressing Miss Clara, he continued, "Mr. Harcourt was observing that the features and the expression of the countenance greatly resemble yours." 
               Harcourt and the young lady both blushed deeply, and Mrs. Withers, passing on, observed, 
               "We hope to see you to-night, at the villa, gentlemen, according to promise." 
               The young men bowed an acknowledgment, and walked away in a different direction from that the ladies had taken. 
               "Upon my word, Harry," said Staynor, "I believe you are already in love with Clara Withers, and she with you. You both blushed when I spoke of the fancied resemblance, as if you had been caught in some guilty action." 
               "You should not have said what you did," replied Harcourt. 
               "And why not? It was a flattering compliment, and, without flattery, it was a truthful one." 
               "She may be offended." 
               "Nonsense! Offended with a compliment to her beauty! I believe she is as amiable as she is pretty. I met her last time I was in Florence, and have seen a good deal of her; but, my dear fellow, there never lived the woman, old or young, handsome or plain, coquette or prude, gentle or shrewish, who was offended at being complimented upon her good looks. You intend to visit the Withers' to-night?" 
               "Of course. Were we not invited?" exclaimed Harcourt, promptly. 
               Staynor smiled. "Yet I have known you to refuse other invitations. It is not absolutely necessary to accept here. Harry, it's no use denying the fact, your face betrays you. You're caught in spite of my warning. You know I bade you beware of the young American houris." 
                
               The evening was spent at the villa occupied by Mrs. Withers, and again, as on the occasion of the former visit, Henry Harcourt managed to engross the society of Miss Clara Withers, greatly to the annoyance of two or three other gentlemen, who were eager to gain the favor of a word and a smile from the young American beauty. 
               Mrs. Withers could not fail to observe the seemingly mutual attraction which drew the two young people-the youngest couple in the room-together; but she did not appear to be displeased at it. A short time before the party broke up, she invited Charles Staynor to occupy a seat on the sofa by her side; she treated him as an old friend-a friend of two seasons is an old friend in Florence-and for some minutes she retained him in close conversation. 
               In the course of half an hour the two young men made their adieux and started on their return to their hotel. 
               "I have made it all right, old fellow," said Staynor to his companion. 
               "All right! What do you mean, Charley?" 
               "Mean? Why all right with the old lady. She could not help observing, as I did, and as every one else has observed who has eyes in his head, that you are more than a little empress with Miss Clara, and it's a proof of your good taste, Harry. If I had any idea just at present of settling in life, I should try to cut you out in that quarter. The old lady was inquisitive: I don't blame her. One meets here with so many adventurers; but, I told her you were a young man of good family; pledged my word for your moral character, and I am in the old dame's good graces, I assure you. She places implicit confidence in me. I said further that you now enjoyed a tolerable allowance, and in the course of a few years would come into possession of a large estate. You can go ahead, Harry. The path's smoothed before you, and the prize is worth winning." 
               Henry Harcourt protested that he had no intentions toward Miss Withers of the nature implied by his friend; but Staynor laughed at his excuses, and so they parted for the night; or, I should rather say, retired to their mutual sleeping apartment, and went to bed. 
               From that period Henry Harcourt was a daily visitor at the villa occupied by the widow and her family. He by degrees overcame his bashfulness, and openly avowed himself the lover of Clara Withers. 
               At the expiration of some weeks Staynor proposed a jaunt to Rome and Genoa, and Harcourt promised to accompany him thither. Before quitting Florence he held a long interview with Clara Withers, and they mutually agreed to correspond with each other. While in Rome, and during the first month of their residence in Genoa, the letters written by Henry were promptly responded to; but at last a letter was received, after a protracted delay, in which the young lady expressed in brief and decided terms her desire that the correspondence they had hitherto maintained should cease. Harcourt was thunder struck. He rose and re-read the letter, and still held it in his hand when Staynor entered the room in which he was sitting. 
               He also held an open letter in his hand. 
               "I am summoned to England, Harry," said he. "This letter, which I have just received, informs me of the serious illness of my late guardian; although I never had much affection for him, my solicitor writes that he has made his will in my favor, and that he wishes to see me before he dies. Of course I can not refuse to go. I could not, even if I had no prospect of gain in view. Will you return to England with me, or I suppose I need scarcely ask the question, will you go back to Florence, and there await my return from England?" 
               "I don't care what I do, or where I go!" answered Harcourt. 
               "Why, what the deuce is the matter? You have a letter, too, I see. Have you heard any bad news?" 
               "Read it, and judge for yourself," replied Harcourt. "It is from Florence-from Clara." 
               Staynor read the letter, and handed it back to his friend. 
                
               "What do you think of it?" demanded the latter. 
               Staynor shrugged his shoulders. 
               "Think of it," said he; "Clara did not write that letter of her own free will. It has been dictated by the old lady. Some of your jealous rivals for Clara's good graces have been poisoning the mother's ears." 
               "What would you advise me to do?" 
               "What would I advise? You know the old adage, 'Faint heart never won fair lady.' I would advise you to return to Florence; see the old lady, and boldly ask what was her motive in dictating this letter to her daughter." 
               "But, suppose she did not dictate the letter?" said Harcourt. "Supposing that it was written by Clara, of her own free will?" 
               "It was not, so there is no need to suppose any thing of the sort. If Clara had written it of her own free will, it would have been differently worded, and would have been either more specific in its details, or would have dismissed you in one brief line. Take my advice. Go and see what is the matter. Set yourself right with the old lady; see Clara, and I warrant that in a day or two you will be better friends than ever." 
               "I will return to Florence," said Harcourt; "but I will not demand any explanation, or offer any. I will visit Mrs. Withers, and if am not well received, it will be the last visit I make." 
               "Pooh, pooh! You are irritated, Harry. You will think better of it. It is some slight misunderstanding, depend upon it, which a few words of explanation will set to rights; but I must go to the passport-office, and make other arrangements for returning to England. A vessel sails at daylight to-morrow morning, and you, if you have made up your mind to return to Florence, will have enough to occupy your time." 
               At daylight the following morning, Staynor embarked on board a brig bound to London; and an hour afterward, Harcourt was seated in the coup of the diligence, en route for Florence. 
               Within an hour after his arrival at that city, he stood at the gate of the villa occupied by Mrs. Withers. An Italian servant opened the gate, and replied in the affirmative to the question, whether Mrs. Withers and the young ladies were within? Henry handed the valet his card, which the latter carried in to the ladies, while the youth, somewhat nervously, awaited the man's return. 
               "The signora and the signorinas are engaged, and can not see Signore Harcourt to-day," was the message brought back by the servant. 
               Henry Harcourt turned away without a word, and mounting his horse, rode back to the hotel. Had he cast his eyes in the direction of the upper windows of the villa, he would have seen the fair face of Clara Withers looking toward him, and, taking courage from the expression the speaking features wore, he would probably not have been in such hot haste to fly from Florence. But he did not do so; and on the evening of that same day, the servant, who had been dispatched to the city on some errand for the family, was met by Clara Withers on his return: 
               "Did you see Signore Harcourt, Lorenzo?" demanded his young mistress. "Did you give him my note? Have you any answer from him?" 
               "The Signore Harcourt has left Florence, signorina," was the servant's reply. "He did not remain an hour after his return to the hotel. He has gone to Paris." 
               And thus Henry Harcourt missed a letter which would have, perhaps, explained every thing, and saved him months and years of mental distress and anxiety. 
               He found his travelling companion and tutor still in Paris, and persuaded him, after having made a short stay in the French capital, to visit Germany. Thence, after six months' absence, he again returned to Florence, resolved to see Miss Clara Withers, and hear from her lips the cause of his banishment from her presence. He arrived with Mr. Wilson in the city early in the morning, and to pass the weary moments till the customary hours of visiting came round, he strolled into the Pitti gallery. A group of ladies, attended by their cavaliers, were standing opposite a large picture. Harcourt strolled toward them, and amid the group he recognized Mrs. Withers and her daughters. Jane was leaning on the arm, and conversing gayly with a gentleman whom he knew to be one who had formerly been an unsuccessful suitor for the hand of the fair American. He was not observed by any of the party, and, with a gesture of mingled contempt and disgust, he turned on his heel and quitted the gallery. The next day, greatly to the astonishment of his travelling companion, he insisted upon leaving Florence, and proceeding to Rome, where they remained for some weeks, after which they returned to Paris, and thence to England. 
               After making a brief stay in England, and visiting his uncle and his mother and sister, the young man, as the reader is aware, again visited the continent. 
               He regretted the haste in which he had fled from Florence without seeing Clara Withers; and blamed himself for his impetuosity, and taught himself to believe that the sudden coolness between him and the Withers' family might be explained, if he were to forego his pride and seek an explanation. Again he hastened to Florence, and learned that Mrs. Withers and her daughters had returned to the United States; that the eldest daughter was married to an English gentleman and that it was reported that Miss Clara Withers was engaged to the French gentleman on whose arm he had seen her leaning in the Pitti gallery. 
               Fully confirmed in his opinion of the deceitfulness of womankind; several times on the point of destroying the letters which he still retained and which he had received from Clara Withers, while in Rome and Genoa, yet as often hesitating to do so, he visited various portions of the continent of Europe, as fancy dictated, until he received, in Hamburg, a letter from his friend and former school-fellow, Charles Staynor. The letter had been written from Christiansund, in Norway, and directed to the care of the London firm with which Mr. John Templeton had been connected, and had been re-mailed to Hamburg. 
               As soon as Henry Harcourt read the letter he resolved to visit Staynor, as Christiansund, and thither he was bound when the vessel, on board of which he embarked, was lost, off the island of Sartaroe. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER X. 
               THE DAY OF DEPARTURE. 
               SEVERAL days necessarily elapsed before Henry Harcourt received a reply to the letter he had written from Sartaroe to the British vice-consul at Bergen, and during these days the time passed wearily enough. Excepting the gloomily magnificent prospect from the cliffs, there is little to be seen on Sartaroo island. A walk to the hamlet or village was sufficiently weary, leading the walker as it did over rocky and precipitous pathways, and affording little to relieve the eye but patches of scant herbage and an occasional straggling pine grove, with here and there a rude, unpicturesque, rough, stone cabin, nestling beneath the precarious shelter the stunted trees afforded. Christian Jansen and his wife, although they were kind and hospitable to the extent of their ability, were but weary companions to the young Englishman, and Louise, during the early portion of the day, was too busily occupied in her manifold household duties to afford him the companionship he might otherwise have found in her society. He soon wearied of roaming on the bleak cliffs alone, and waited each day impatiently for the evening, when, if the weather was fair, the young maiden and he strolled out together, and, if unfavorable, chatted together over the fire, within doors. It was rarely that any of the pilots of fishermen visited the light-house, for every one was now occupied, making the most of the short summer season, and if, by chance, Hans, or Rolf, or Erik, or any other of the young men of he island, did look in, they acted toward him with illconcealed coolness. 
                
               For some reasons, best known to themselves, Henry Harcourt was regarded with jealousy and dislike by those who had risked their own lives to save his. 
               At length a sloop arrived from Bergen, bringing a letter from the vice-consul, who condoled with his young countryman over his misfortune, and congratulated him upon his happy escape from the fate of his late companions on shipboard. 
               The vice-consul had inclosed a small sum of money in Norwegian currency, sufficient to enable the youth to defray his expenses incurred at Sartaroe, and to recompense those who had generously befriended him in his hour of need, for their hospitality. He invited him to cross to Bergen, and take up his abode at the consulate, until he heard from his friend at Christiansund, and received such assistance thence as would enable him to continue his travels. 
               Relieved of his more immediate anxieties, through this kind letter and the remittance it contained, Henry Harcourt made arrangements to set out for Bergen on board the next boat which quitted Sartaroe bound to the ancient capital. He still had three days to remain on the island, and rejoiced as he was at the prospect of a speedy release from his ocean-washed prison, he still felt some regret at the thought of parting, in all likelihood forever, with the generous old couple with whom he had found a temporary shelter, and with the guileless, childlike Louise, whom, in the short time he had spent at Sartaroe, he had learned to love as a sister. 
               It was approaching the hour of sunset, on the day previous to that on which he was to embark on board the sloop for Bergen, when Louise, who had terminated her labors for the day, sallied forth, in response to an invitation from Henry, to take one last stroll-probably the last walk the youthful couple would ever take together-along the margin of the cliffs. Rain had fallen heavily for two or three days previously; but this day had been fine and warm, and even the desert-rock of Sartaroe looked fresh and bright under the influence of the mild spring weather. The ocean, almost incessantly agitated, even in the fairest days of the year, was, this evening, calm and still as an inland lake in summer; the slanting rays of the setting sun tinged its broad surface with prismatic hues, and golden belts, so bright that it dazzled the eye to look upon them; the rugged spires of the rocks and skerries rose black and gloomy from their ocean bed, like grim sentries, turned into stone, keeping watch over an area of desert silence, from which all life had been banished-for even the sea-fowl, as if impressed with the unusual quiet, had retired before the customary hour to their rests in the clefts of the rocks, and there was neither breath of air nor cry of bird to disturb the dreamy repose. The low, hollow murmur of the sea, as it washed against and receded from the shelving beach at the base of one of the cliffs, which did not, like the rest, immediately overhang the water, was the only sound which broke the silence; and paradoxical as it may seem to those who have never gazed upon the ocean in its rare intervals of quietude, this hollow murmur added solemnity to the stillness of nature. It was felt rather than heard, like the ticking of a clock at the hour of midnight, the low breathing of a sleeping infant in its cradle, or the monotonous hum of a nurse rocking her charge to sleep, when the ordinary turmoil of the nursery is hushed. 
               On the rude bench, heretofore mentioned, near the edge of the cliff, Henry and Louise seated themselves and gazed down upon the vast, wastery plain far beneath them, its unruffled surface unbroken, save by the rocky, spires already alluded to, and here and there by the dark hull and taper mast of a becalmed sloop or fishing smack. 
               Louise was the first to break a silence which had been maintained for several minutes: 
               "At this hour to-morrow, Herr Henry, you will be in Bergen?" she said. 
               "I hope so, Louise," was Harcourt's reply. 
               "And I-I shall be here-alone." 
                
               There was something in the tone of the maiden's voice as she uttered this last remark, which touched the sympathies of the young man. Louise had spoken as it were to herself, and yet, as if in deprecation of the hope so strongly expressed by her companion. 
               "I said, Louise, that I hoped to be in Bergen to-morrow," he repeated; "but I shall often think of the many pleasant hours I have spent with you upon these cliffs, and, during the evenings, in the little cabin at the light-house." 
               "We, too, shall think of you, Herr Henry," replied Louise; "and I, I shall think of the many fine stories you have told me of countries far away over the sea, which I have heard not much of till you came here to tell me." 
               "Until I came, after a fashion which I do not care to repeat," said the young man, smiling; "but you shall know more, Louise, than I have told, or can tell you. I will spend you the Danish books I have promised, and I shall take care that they contain pictures of the places and the sights I have described to you." 
               "Oh! that will be good. I shall be too happy!" exclaimed the young girl, clapping her hands in the exuberance of her innocent delight. 
               "You read Danish well, Louise. If I had time and opportunity, I would teach you to read English. But how is it-you have never informed me-how is it that you, who all your life have lived on this desert rock, learned to read and write so well?" 
               "My grandfather taught me my letters, and to read the Danish Bible, and Hilda Welden taught me all the rest that I learned." 
               "Hilda Welden?" 
               "Yes, Herr Henry; Hilda, Rolf Frode's sister. She lent me, too, the other books than the Bible that I have read; but they are not too many. It is long since that I have read them all." 
                
               "But I never have seen Hilda, or any other of the young women of Sartaroe at the light-house?" 
               "Not now-no. It is not often now they come; but in the time of winter, then often." 
               "You must, indeed, be very lonely here during the long summer evenings, Louise?" 
               "Sometimes, yes; but I am used to it. Soon, my uncle Carl will come to take charge of the light-house; my grandfather is growing too old and feeble, and then he will go from here to his native village, and I shall go with him. He says I shall not be so lonesome there; but I fear I shall. I shall not then see Hilda Welden, nor Katrina Petersen, nor Hans-nor-" 
               "Rolf Frode; eh, Louise? I have finished the sentence for you, have I not?" 
               A faint blush suffused the cheek of the young maiden, but she made no reply. 
               "One would imagine," said the young man, after a pause, "that the solitude in which you islanders live would lead you to people these desert rocks and skerries, and these deep and usually stormy waters with creatures of your own creation. I, for my part, can conceive no more fitting abode for the ghosts of the old vikings who once peopled these shores, and whose delight was in dangerous adventure at sea, than these cavernous cliffs or yonder skerries; and mermen and mermaids might well hold court, and revel in the depths of these waters we now look down upon. I should often thus amuse myself, if I were compelled to live here in solitude." 
               "We have many tales such as you speak of," replied Louise. "You see yonder black rock with the deep cavern, in which the sea roars with a terrible noise in the time of storm? It is said that the spirit of Odin still haunts the rock, and when the fishermen chance to pass by the cavern at the hour of midnight they always cast a fish into the water, to appease the spirit and save themselves from the fury with which, in storm and tempest, he would otherwise assail them." 
                
               "Have you ever seen this spirit, Louise?" 
               "No, Herr Henry. It is not true. Hilda says it is superstition. You do not believe these stories are true?" 
               "No, Louise; but I am still sometimes boy enough to wish they were." 
               "It is getting late, Herr Henry. The sun has already dipped beneath the waters. Let us return to the light-house." 
               "As you will, Louise; though I could sit and gaze upon this scene till midnight; but perhaps it is best to go within doors. I have to rise early to-morrow. I shall send you the books and a few trinkets, and other trifles for keepsakes, as soon as possible; and now I have one favor to ask: have you no trifle which you can give me to keep in remembrance of the pleasant hours I have spent with you in this island, which but for you would have been a dreary abode to me?" 
               "I have nothing that would be of value to Herr Henry," replied the maiden. 
               "I want nothing of value, Louise. The value of the gift would consist in its having come from you." 
               "Here, then, is a purse, I have worked out of colored wool, of my own weaving. I made it for you, to give you when you should leave the island; but the gift is so poor that I was ashamed to offer it." 
               With the ingenuous frankness of a nature that knew no guile, she drew forth, as she spoke, a gayly-colored and prettily-knitted purse from her bosom, and smiling and blushing, placed it in the young man's hand, and in so doing also drew forth a small gold locket suspended from her neck by a black silk ribbon, which Harcourt had observed-with some curiosity as to what was attached to it-that she constantly wore. 
               "The purse is very pretty, and shall be kept, and not used, as a memento of my residence at Sartaroe," said he; "and now, Louise, show me that locket, if you will. What does it contain that is so dearly cherished? Your portrait? or perhaps that of Hans Petersen or Rolf Frode?" 
                
               "Neither!" exclaimed the girl, smiling. "It contains a portrait, but I know not of whom. It was round my neck when my grandfather brought me-a baby-from Mandal, where I was born. You can see it, Herr Henry," passing the trinket to the young man. 
               "Your mother, I suppose?" said Harcourt, taking the locket from her hands. 
               "No-they tell me no; those who knew my mother, say it is unlike her. It is that of a lady finely dressed and adorned with jewels. But they tell me I must never part with it lest harm should befall me. It is perhaps a superstition of our people; but I should fear to part with it now?" 
               The young man could not help remarking the beauty of the workmanship displayed, in the case. He unclasped the trinket, and saw within, as Louise had told him, the portrait of a beautiful female. It was a miniature painted on ivory, and the bright twilight of the northern spring, afforded sufficient light to enable him to examine the lineaments of the face. 
               The features were those of a youthful female. The complexion was that of a brunette, and the hair and eyes were dark, the latter flowing in wavy tresses over the well-rounded shoulders. The dress was rich and of the fashion in vogue twenty years before. There was not the slightest resemblance in the picture to the blue-eyed, fair-haired girl who stood by his side. But there was something in the portrait which fixed the attention of the youth. He gazed at it long and earnestly, and, then, still holding the locket in his hand, he raised his eyes thoughtfully, like one who strives to recall some past recollection, almost obliterated from the memory by the lapse of years. Then handing it back to its owner, he said, 
               "It does not indeed resemble you, Louise. It is strange," he muttered, as if communing with himself; "I fancy I have somewhere seen that face; the features are familiar to me; yet where I have seen it, or when, I can not tell-. Surely that can not be," he added after a pause; then addressing his companion panion, he said, "You say you have worn that trinket since you were an infant?" 
               "Yes, Herr Henry." 
               "For eighteen or twenty years," muttered the young man to himself. "You were born at Mandal, Louise?" 
               "Yes." 
               "That is near the Lindesnez, on the southern coast of Norway?" 
               "Yes, Herr Henry." 
               "And no person has ever told you who first suspended the locket round your neck?" 
               "No one, Herr Henry; perhaps it was my mother, who died, they tell me, a fortnight after my birth." 
               "Perhaps so," replied the young man, thoughtfully and doubtfully. Then he added with singular earnestness, 
               "Take care of it, Louise. Never part with it. It may be a talisman, productive of future benefit to you. Who knows?" Then changing the topic of conversation, he said. 
               "So you think of quitting this island shortly? I shall try to find you out, and to see you again before I return to England. I shall probably spend the summer in Norway. Perhaps before the autumn arrives-before I see you again, Louise, you will be married?" 
               "Not so soon, Herr Henry," artlessly replied the girl, and then she continued, with the confiding simplicity of innocence, 
               "Now you are going away, perhaps never to return, I will tell you a secret. Since the day when Rolf Frode, at my request, enabled you to obtain possession of the trunk that was picked up in the bay, he has been three times to see me at the light-house; and the last time he came he asked me to become, some day, his wife. He is the best and bravest of all the young men on the island. Do you not think so, too, Herr Henry?" 
               "I do, Louise." 
               "Then I promised him I would be his wife; but he is poor, and my grandfather, to whom we confided the secret of our betrothal, insisted that he should wait until he got another fishing-boat of his own. Ah! that will be a long time to wait, Herr Henry." 
               "Perhaps not so long as you seem to fear, Louise. Rolf is honest and industrious. Fortune may befriend him." 
               "Ah! if I could only think so, Herr Henry. He works hard, poor Rolf! and supports his sister Hilda and her children. If it were not for that, he would soon earn money to purchase a boat." 
               "Will Rolf be at the light-house to-night? I should like to bid him good-by before I leave the island." 
               "No, Herr Henry; he sailed with the fleet which left yesterday for the fishing-grounds." 
               "Then tell Rolf, when you see him again, that I wish him success and happiness, and that I will write to him from Christiansund." 
               They had drawn near the light-house while thus conversing, and were about entering the little garden, when Rolf unexpectedly appeared before them, accompanied by a tall, weather-beaten man, of about forty years of age, attired in a suit of oil-skin, such as is worn by pilots. 
               "Rolf returned!" exclaimed Louise, "and my Uncle Carl, too!" and springing away from her companion, she was the next moment locked in her uncle's embrace. As soon as the latter released her, she turned to Rolf and welcomed him, at the same time expressing her surprise to see him returned so soon. 
               The young man took her proffered hand and held it for some moments clasped within his own; he smiled too, as he witnessed the delight, at seeing him, so vividly expressed in her countenance; but he spoke but a few words. Something had evidently occurred to distress and annoy him. 
               "This is Herr Henry, Uncle Carl," said Louise, introducing Harcourt to her relative, and rapidly explaining, in the Norsk dialect, the cause of the young man's temporary residence on the island. 
               "I have heard all from Rolf," was Carl Jansen's reply, in the same language. "I passed through the fishing fleet, this morning, and Rolf came on board the pilot-boat, to welcome me on my return. I had something of importance to communicate to him and to you, Louise, therefore I persuaded him to return with me." 
               "To communicate to Rolf and me, uncle? What can it be?" 
               "You shall know to-night, Louise. Come, let us go in doors. I want to see my uncle and aunt. Rolf tells me they are well." 
               The language in which this conversation was carried on was unintelligible to Henry Harcourt, but it was evident to him that something unexpected, and to judge from the expression of the countenance of Carl and Rolf, something not very agreeable had occurred. 
               The supper-table was set when the party entered the cabin, and, the greetings of the old folks over, they sat down to the table. 
               The conversation was still carried on in the Norsk dialect, and Harcourt could not help feeling that, under such circumstances, he was un de trop. He noticed, however, that the appetite of Rolf had failed him, and that Louise was so anxious to hear what it was her uncle had to tell her, that she was glad when the meal was ended. 
               Then Carl, Rolf, and Louise retired together to another apartment; the old couple went to bed, and Harcourt was left alone. 
               He strolled out for an hour, and on his return, finding that Carl and the two young people were still closeted together, he retired to rest. 
               At an early hour the next morning the household was astir. The sloop on board which he was to proceed to Bergen, was to sail at eight o'clock; as soon, therefore, as breakfast was over, he commenced this preparations for departure. 
               These were soon made. His sole effects consisted of the few articles contained in the chest saved from the wreck. They comprised merely a few books, one or two articles of clothing, and the letters written by Clara Withers, which latter had given rise to the anxiety of the young man to repossess himself of the chest. 
               Contrary to her usual habit, Louise did not make her appearance at the breakfast-table, and when, at the conclusion of the meal, she did appear, her face was pale and her eyes swollen, like one who had been weeping, and who had passed a sleepless night. Carl and Rolf preserved the same thoughtful demeanor they had betrayed the evening before. 
               Louise, however, greeted the young man with a smile and a hearty shake of the hand. Having bidden farewell to the old light-house keeper and his wife, and almost forced upon them a liberal remuneration for the generous hospitality they had manifested toward him, he proceeded to the pier where the sloop lay, accompanied by Louise and Carl and Rolf, the latter two carrying his chest between them. When the sails were hoisted on board the sloop, he extended his hand to Louise, as a parting salute, and whispered in her ear that he would not forget his promise to write to Rolf, and, perhaps, he added, "the boat may be purchased sooner than you dream of." 
               To his great surprise, the young girl turned her face away, and when she again turned toward him, he noticed that her bosom was heaving, and that tears were trembling on her eyelids. She held his hand a moment longer and then suddenly turning away, sprang ashore. 
               Carl heartily shook hands with the young man, and bade him, in Norsk, "God speed;" but when he turned to shake hands with Rolf, he discovered that the young fisherman had gone on shore and joined Louise. 
               Five minutes more and the sloop, under full sail, was rounding ing the point which would shut her out from the view of the spectators on shore. 
               Harcourt stood by the taff'rail, waving his handkerchief. The salute was returned by Louise, and Carl and Rolf raised their caps and waved them above their heads. 
               Another minute, and the party on shore were no longer visible, and taking a book from his pocket, the young man seated himself on the low bulwarks of the little vessel, to read; but, though he held the book in his hand and looked upon the open page, his thoughts were otherwise engaged, and for hours he busied himself with fruitless surmises as to the cause of the blight which the arrival of Carl Jansen had evidently cast over the cheerful household of the light-house keeper of Sartaroe. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XI. 
               BAD NEWS FROM ABROAD. 
               RETURN we from the bleak and desolate coast of Norway to Templeton Villa, on the banks of the gentle, placid Hudson river. 
               Three months had elapsed since the arrival in the United States of Mrs. Harcourt and her daughter Alice. Three months, during which period Mr. John Templeton had often delicately hinted to his sister that his house was so small that it would materially increase her comfort, if she would hire a place of her own. Nay, more, he even hinted that, if she came to that conclusion, he owned a neat little villa, most pleasantly located, and only a few miles distant, which she could occupy at a mere nominal rent; but the lady turned a deaf ear to these soft persuasions, wisely considering that house-rent and board free, and no servants' wages to pay, were preferable to free rent alone; and at the expiration of these three months, Mr. John Templeton had become so much attached to his gentle niece, that it had become doubtful in his own mind whether he could live without her, and whether the music of her sweet voice, and the presence of her lithe and graceful figure, and her bright smiles and pretty endearments, did not, at least in a great measure, compensate for the disagree abilities concomitant with her mother's residence at the villa. 
               To be sure, the old bachelor was no longer allowed to ensconce himself in his study; and almost every evil he had fancied, had come to pass. He no longer possessed a single room in the house, except his bedroom, that he could call his own. Traces of feminine intrusion were everywhere visible. Then he, who had hitherto almost lived the life of a hermit, receiving no visits save those of a few bachelor cronies of his own stamp, now found his dwelling continually filled with visitors of a class with whose tastes he had no affinity: young men of "fast" propensities, who came to pay court to the gentle Alice, the anticipated heiress of the broad acres, and State bonds of her uncle; ladies of expensive habits and slender purses, who elevated Mrs. Harcourt to the position of their guide and Mentor in all that appertained to taste and fashion. She who was the widow of a gentleman but a degree removed from the dignity of a title; she who had lived in Paris, and flirted at Almack's in London; how could she be other than an arbiter in such matters as these? Mr. Templeton's servants, who had lived with him for years in peace and content, were now constantly in a state of mutiny, which he found it difficult to suppress; but then he was told that he had been used to give his dependants too great liberty, and that they winced and rebelled when subjected to proper control. Again and again he was urged to occupy a house in New York during the winter season, and live in a style suitable to a man of his fortune. 
               This, however, he positively refused to do, and Mrs. Harcourt, not considering her own moderate income sufficient to enable her to launch into such extravagance at her own expense, forbore to press the matter. 
               On this day-three months after the arrival of the lady at Templeton Villa-affairs had reached an alarming crisis. Mrs. Jenkins, the housekeeper, had requested an interview with Mr. Templeton in the morning, and had formally tendered her resignation, and when asked the reason, had declared she could not continue to hold the responsible position she occupied at the villa, if Mrs. Harcourt persisted in attempting to rule the household. Mr. Templeton, who would almost have felt himself to be houseless unless Mrs. Jenkins superintended his domestic affairs, had much difficulty in pacifying the good old lady, and only succeeded at last by promising that he would positively insist that his sister should cease to intermeddle with the housekeeper's business for the future. 
               Soon after Mrs. Jenkins retired, Mr. Templeton summoned Thomas, the coachman and groom, and man-servant in general. 
               "Thomas," said he, "put the horses to the carriage. I intend to take a drive to Hudson before dinner." 
               "The horses are dead-beat, sir; 'Fancy' is quite lame. For two days they have been in harness from morning till night." 
               "How is that, Thomas? I should hardly think they would have been much needed while I was at New York. (Mr. Templeton had only the night before returned from a business visit to the city.) 
               "Mrs. Harcourt has been out visiting, sir, from morning till night; going round the country, delivering invitations for the great party that is to come off next week." 
               "What party, Thomas? I declare I have heard nothing about it! I must speak to Mrs. Harcourt; and, Thomas, inform Mrs. Harcourt that in future when she requires the carriage, it is my desire that she should inform me." 
               "If you please, sir, unless I have some help in the stables, I must resign my situation, which I don't want to do; but I can't do the out-door work, and be always spruced-up fit to attend the parlors. Mrs. Harcourt scolded me yesterday, before some ladies and gentlemen who were here, and accused me of smelling of the stables." 
               "Thomas," said Mr. Templeton, "you are my servant, not Mrs. Harcourt's. In future, go about your work as you have been accustomed to do, and take no heed of her. The horses are lame, you say? Very well, then. You need not mind putting them to the carriage to-day." 
               Mr. Templeton put on his hat and went down stairs, intending to walk in the garden. He was intercepted in the hall by the cook: 
                
               "Please, sir, I should like to speak a word with you, sir," said she, dropping a courtesy. 
               "Very well; what is it, Janet?" 
               "Please, sir, I've been with you two years next month, and I hope I have always given satisfaction. I had a three years' character from my last place, which I shouldn't have left, only, as you know-" 
               "I know all about that, Janet," said Mr. Templeton, arresting the loquacity of the woman. "You have always given me satisfaction. What is it you wish to say to me?" 
               "Please, sir, I can't given satisfaction any longer to Mrs. Harcourt. She's always a coming down into the Kitchen and finding fault with every thing; and I must have more help in the Kitchen, sir. I can't take it upon myself to do all that is required for a large party such as is a coming next week. If not, sir, my month's up, on Saturday, and I wish to give warning," and the cook raised her apron to her eyes and began to cry, as she blubbered forth, "and Mary-the-the-housemaid-she's wore off her legs-and-wants to-to-give warning, too." 
               "This is intolerable," ejaculated Mr. Templeton. "There is to be no party that I am aware of, you silly woman. Go down to the Kitchen, and recollect that I am master in this house." 
               "Mrs. Harcourt is missus," muttered the cook, as she proceeded down stairs; "and she ain't going to be no missus of mine no longer." 
               Mr. Templeton walked out into the garden. The flower-beds were choked with weeds, and he summoned the gardener and inquired the reason. 
               "I was busy all day yesterday and the day before with the cucumber frames, and in the grapery, sir. I had no time to attend to the flower beds," answered the gardener. 
               "Where is the boy? what do I keep him for? Set him to work at the flower-beds at once." 
                
               "He's out with the poney chaise, driving Mrs. Harcourt and Miss Alice, sir." 
               "Where was he yesterday and the day before?" 
               "Mrs. Harcourt had him along with her, sir, dressed in his livery, behind the carriage. He told me he was delivering invitation cards to a party." 
               "Very well, gardener; when he returns tell him to put on his garden jacket and set to work and weed these beds, and when he is wanted to drive the poney chaise again, tell him to come and ask my permission first." 
               "A pretty state of things!" muttered the old bachelor to himself. "I shall be driven out of the house myself next. However, I'll have no more of it. I'll come to a settlement this very day." 
               Mrs. Harcourt and her daughter did not return to dinner. The old bachelor sat foaming and fussing in solitary dignity during the meal and retired afterward to the parlor, professedly to pass the time in reading, but in reality to "nurse his wrath and keep it warm." Toward sunset he heard the sound of carriage wheels on the avenue which led to the villa from the high-road. He knew it was his sister who had returned home; but instead of going to the door to meet her as he was accustomed to do, he sat still and rigid in his chair, arming himself for the forthcoming assaut des mots, which he anticipated. 
               However it was not destined to come off at this time; the keen edge of the uncle's wrath was taken off, as it had been a dozen times before, by the caresses of his niece, who came running into the room, and flinging her arms round her uncle's neck and kissing his cheek, exclaimed gleefully, 
               "O, uncle; mamma and I have had such a nice long drive; and, coming home, we called at the village post-office, and what do you think? there was a packet of letters for you; and one is from abroad-from the continent of Europe-from Hamburg, I think; but it has been to London, and then down to Dorset, where ma and I used to live, and then has been redirected directed and sent out here. It has four or five post-marks on it. It must be from dear Henry, uncle. I am so glad. It is such a long time since we have heard from him. Here is the packet, uncle." 
               "Ay, the young, good-for-nothing scapegrace," said Mr. Templeton, taking the packet from the young lady, somewhat sulkily, though considerably mollified, for he had returned his niece's caress, and was now stroking her curls affectionately. 
               "Ay, It is from Hamburg,"-examining the letter specially alluded to. "A request for more money, I suppose, as usual Henry Harcourt seldom writes unless he wants money. Thank heaven, in a year or two more, he'll come into possession of his father's estate, and then he can set to work and ruin himself as fast as he pleases, and when he comes to beggary, as he certainly will do, he needn't expect to get any further assistance from me. I'll disown the young reprobate." 
               "O uncle, uncle; don't speak so of Henry. He was very kind to me when he came to see us before he went abroad the last time; and he always spoke kindly and respectfully of you." 
               "Then why the d-l didn't he stay at home as a young man in his position ought to have done?" 
               "Dear uncle, you know mamma, although, of course, she loves Henry very much, has not been used to boys, and-I don't think Henry was very comfortable when at our house." 
               "Well, Alice, darling, there is something in that. I shouldn't think he was very comfortable; the young dog has a proper conception of things, and the d-l himself would be uncomfortable if he were obliged to live in the same house with-" 
               At this moment Mrs. Harcourt entered the room, and the old bachelor refrained from concluding the sentence he was in the act of uttering. 
               "Well, brother John," said Mrs. Harcourt, "we have brought, as you perceive, a packet of letters from the post-office, and among them there is one, which I presume is from my undutiful ful son Henry. Directed to you, of course, not to his mother, to whom any other child would naturally write; but Henry has got his father's disposition and temper." 
               "He may thank heaven he does not possess his mother's," muttered Mr. Templeton, between his teeth. 
               Meanwhile the bachelor had been searching for his spectacles, and wiping the glasses with his handkerchief when he found them. He now fixed them on his nose, and notwithstanding there were two other letters from London, and two or three from New York, the first letter he took up was that vi London from Hamburg. 
               Like a good many other people Mr. Templeton was accustomed to examine the superscription and the seal of a letter if he were in any doubt as to whom it came from, and to speculate as to the probable or possible writer, when by breaking the seal he could have satisfied himself at once. He acted thus in the present instance. When he examined the superscription, after having adjusted his spectacles to his satisfaction, something in the appearance of the handwriting satisfied him that it was not from his nephew. He handed it to his sister to corroborate his suspicions. 
               "You can soon inform yourself by opening the letter, brother John," was the lady's observation, as she returned the letter. "My son Henry has really favored me so little with his epistles, that I can not pretend to judge his handwriting." 
               Mr. Templeton now broke the seal, and drawing the letter from its envelop, proceeded to read its contents. He had, however, scarcely glanced over the first half dozen lines, before he exclaimed, in a tone, and with an expression of the deepest concern, 
               "God bless me! Poor boy! Poor, unfortunate boy! This is shocking!" 
               "Uncle, dear uncle, what is the matter?" exclaimed Alice. 
               "Is Henry ill? Has he met with an accident? Speak, uncle, say, what has happened?" 
                
               Mr. Templeton made no reply. He read the brief epistle to the end, and then handed it to Mrs. Harcourt, who, with pallid face and distended eyes was gazing upon the unwonted agitation of her brother, fearful herself to ask its cause. 
               Mrs. Harcourt merely glanced at the first few lines, and then giving utterance to a fearful shriek, tottered to the sofa, and fell fainting upon it. The letter dropped to the floor. Alice, who had stook as if petrified with mingled surprise and affright, now hastened to the assistance of her mother. Mrs. Jenkins was speedily summoned, and restoratives were applied, and Mrs. Harcourt was conveyed, still in a state of partial unconsciousness, to her own room. 
               Alice was about to follow her mother, when she espied the letter on the carpet; she was stooping to pick it up, when her uncle called to her, 
               "Alice, my love, bring that letter to me." 
               She complied with the request, and her uncle continued, 
               "Alice, can you bear to listen to sad intelligence? You will not faint, or scream, or act foolishly, Alice?" 
               "Oh, no, uncle, no. Tell me, pray tell me what has happened? Henry is ill, perhaps dying; perhaps-dead! I can bear to hear it, uncle. Any thing is more endurable than suspense." 
               "You are a good, brave girl, Alice," replied her uncle. "Come here," and he placed his arm round her waist. "I will read the letter aloud. I scarcely know what it says myself; but, Alice, poor Henry is dead!" 
               In spite of her promise, Alice could not suppress an exclamation of horror. Her face was pale as death, her lips blanched, and her limbs trembled as she leaned for support against her uncle. 
               "Shall I read the letter, Alice?" 
               "If you please, uncle," was the faint response, uttered in a voice choking with suppressed emotion. 
               In a voice scarcely intelligible, in consequence of its tremor, Mr. Templeton read as follows: 
                
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "HAMBURG, May -, 18-. 
                              "MR. JOHN TEMPLETON:
                            
                           "MY DEAR SIR.-It is my painful task to inform you of the sad fate which has befallen your nephew, Mr. Henry Harcourt. On the 5th instant your nephew called at my banking-house and requested to know the exact amount of funds to his account, then in our hands. The amount was five hundred and twenty-three pounds six shillings and four pence, British sterling. The young gentleman then drew the odd sum, and requested a letter of credit from our house for five hundred pounds, payable at the house of Steinbach & Co., of Christiansund, in Norway. 
                           "This was, of course, promptly supplied him. He then entered into conversation with me, in the course of which he stated that he had engaged a passage to Bergen and Christiansund on board the bark Jung Frau, and that the vessel was to sail on the following morning. I think he stated that he expected to meet an old schoolfellow at Christiansund, and that it was his intention to spend the ensuing summer months in making the tour of Norway; but of this I am not certain, as I did not take much heed of the conversation at the time. 
                           "The. Jung Frau did sail at the time appointed, and I heard nothing further respecting her till Monday last, when I read in the Hamburg Shipping List that the vessel went ashore on the rocks of Sartaroe during a violent gale, and became a total wreck. Not a soul of those on board was saved. I immediately instituted further inquiries, in the course of which the report was corroborated beyond the possibility of doubt. Thinking it my duty to acquaint the family of the unfortunate young gentleman with his sad fate, I made further inquiries among those who had known him, when in this city, and learnt from them that he had an uncle at the head of the firm of Templeton & Co., Leadenhall-street, London. 
                           "I have lost no time, as you will perceive, in putting myself in communication with you, and would like to hear from you in reply to this, at the earliest opportunity. The money, now in our hands (five hundred pounds sterling) will be transmitted per bill of exchange on London, to your order, whenever you apply for it. 
                           "Sincerely sympathizing with you and the other members of the poor young gentleman's family, 
                           
                              "I subscribe myself, sir, with profound respect, 
                              "Your obedient servant, 
                              "PETER VAN NESS, 
                              "Banker, etc., Hamburg. 
                               
                                 "John Templeton, Esq., Leadenhall-street, London." 
                              
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               "Oh, uncle! is there no hope?" exclaimed Alice, when Mr. Templeton had completed the perusal of the letter; "May it not be that some of the crew and passengers, dear Henry among them, were saved?" 
               "I fear not, my love; the banker writes too positively. Poor Henry! Poor, dear boy! I have spoken, at times, too harshly of him. I was in a bad humor to-night. Ah, Alice! How little do we reflect, in the hour of ease and prosperity, what frail creatures we are; how necessary to happiness is mutual forbearance; how much we all stand in need of forgiveness! How vainly we wish, when the hour of trial comes, and it is too late, that we could recall the bitter words we often unthinkingly give utterance to! Leave me now, my darling Alice. I have much to think of-much to ask pardon of God for. Your mamma will want you up stairs. Comfort her, Alice dear. You are a brave, good girl. Kiss me; and now, good night." 
               The sad intelligence received from Europe soon spread through the household. Mrs. Jenkins, with whom, as the reader is aware, Henry was a great favorite, was loud and earnest in her lamentations when she heard of his supposed untimely death. 
               It is needless to say that the great party, the arrangements for which, made without his knowledge, had gravely offended Mr. Templeton, was set aside, and, for a time, the bickerings and disputes which had disturbed the serenity of the bachelor's abode, were forgiven and forgotten; for, as all believed, God, in his mysterious providence, had seen fit to visit the family with sore affliction, and to snatch from it its anticipated future prop-its hope and pride; and the proudest and vainest among us feel our own nothingness, and the necessity of mutual for bearance among ourselves; of humble dependence upon Him, and of contrite submission to His divine will, when He, in His inscrutable wisdom, sees fit to cleanse our souls from the earth dross which clings to us, by compelling us to pass through the purifying waters of affliction. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XII. 
               CHRISTIANSUND AT LAST. 
               MEANWHILE he for whose supposed untimely fate a household was mourning, was heartily enjoying himself in the vicinity of Christiansund. He had landed safely in Bergen, a few hours after he had waved adieu to Louise, from the stern of the sloop which was bearing him from Sartaroe island. He was hospitably received by the vice-consul, and now verbally pressed to make the consulate his home, until letters arrived from Christiansund. His first care was to write to Mr. Van Ness, the Hamburg banker, and to request that another bill of exchange on the house with which Mr. Van Ness did business at Christiansund, should be forwarded thither by the earliest opportunity, and this duty done, he amused himself, while awaiting a letter from Staynor, with rambling about the city and taking occasional jaunts into the surrounding country. 
               To one who, though familiar with the southern continent of Europe, had never visited its northern shores, the city of Bergen presents sufficient novelty to engage the attention, and prevent the time from passing heavily. 
               The gothic cathedral; the fortifications; the three commodious harbors-rapidly filling with shipping as the summer advanced; the markets, especially the fish-market, arranged after a fashion so different from those of southern Europe, were each visited in turn; and the wide streets and squares, and white houses with their roofs of red pantiles, and the neatness and cleanliness every where remarkable, gave a light and cheery aspect to the city, which had its effect upon the spirits of the visitor. 
               Accompanied by the vice-consul, he ascended the mountains which rise immediately behind the city, and from the summit of one of the most elevated peaks, looked down upon hundreds of other mountains of every variety of fantastic shape, and admired the grand landscape interspersed with lakes, cataracts, and rivers, extending in a southerly direction to the great chain of the Hardanger Fjeld. This majestic range of mountains he resolved to explore, with Staynor as his companion, on his return southward from Christiansund. He might even have been tempted to undertake the task during this first visit in their vicinity, had he not received the eagerly looked for letter from his friend, just a week after he had landed at Bergen. 
               Staynor supplied him with the remittance he had asked for, and urged him immediately to join him at Christiansund, where he (Staynor) would await his arrival, though by so doing, he would be obliged to delay a projected visit to Drontheim. 
               A bring in the port chanced to be bound to Drontheim. She was to sail the day following that on which he received the letter from Staynor. In this vessel he engaged a passage, the captain engaging to put him on shore at Christiansund. He bade farewell to the hospitable vice-consul and his family, promising to visit them again on his return to Bergen, and embarking on board the brig, was safely landed at Christiansund, after a pleasant passage of four days. 
               Staynor was anxiously awaiting his arrival. He had observed the boat put off from the ship, and surmised that his expected visitor might be on board. Consequently he had come down to the pier and there stood ready to greet him, as soon as he set foot on shore. 
               "Welcome, Harry," he exclaimed, grasping the young man's hand. "I saw the boat leave the ship, and thought it likely you might be on board. You're just in time for breakfast, so hurry up. The house where I am stopping is close by. The sailors will carry up your luggage. Are these all your traps?" pointing to the solitary chest in the boat. "I forgot, though. You are a shipwrecked mariner, and are lucky to escape with life. Under such circumstances we are generally content to let the traps go. Come, my men," addressing the sailors: "a couple of you catch hold of that chest and follow us. That is the place," again addressing Harcourt; "the white house there under the hill." 
               He had seized Harcourt by the arm, while rapidly giving utterance to these words, without pausing a moment for any reply, and the two young men, followed by the sailors, carrying the trunk, were in a few minutes at the house. 
               "Clap that trunk down in the passage, my lads," said Staynor. "That 'll do; here," and he gave the sailors a handful of skillings.
                     A small copper coin of which 120 go to make up a dollar.
                   "And now, Harry, mount up stairs; breakfast is on the table. I had just ordered it when I saw the brig heave to." 
               The apartment into which Staynor introduced his friend was a small and very plainly furnished room, although every thing was neat and comfortable. It contained the inevitable stove, in which a good fire was burning, for though it was now the month of June, the mornings were still sufficiently cold to render the warmth of a fire agreeable. The table in the center of the room was covered with a snowy white cloth, upon which were arranged fish cooked in several different ways, fresh butter, cheese, milk, boiled mutton, and small loaves of brown, bread, and on the stove stood a large coffee-pot, the steam from which perfumed the room with its agreeable fragrance. 
               "Now, Harry, sit down, and help yourself. You must be hungry, just coming from breathing the sea air-I am, at all events. There is no stint here, you see, although this is no hotel. There are no hotels here, for the very good reason that if there were there would be no visitors to occupy them; but a stray traveler, like myself, can always get accommodations at a private house. This house belongs to a merchant, one Mr. Roskenchilde, who permits me to board and lodge here, at the very reasonable charge of one specie dollar a day; but now let's have breakfast, and we'll talk afterward." 
               Both the young men enjoyed a hearty meal, and when the breakfast things were removed, Staynor threw up the window of his apartment, and drew his friend toward it. 
               "Now, Harry," said he, "confess that you never saw a fairer scene in your life than can be seen from this window." 
               "It is very beautiful," said Harcourt. 
               "Beautiful! that word is altogether too inexpressive. Look at the waters of the bay, glistening in the rays of the morning sun-one sheet of silver, except near the shores, where the mountains cast their dark shadows. Although it is exposed to the North Sea, it is almost always as smooth as a mill-pond, for it is sheltered on every hand by rocks and islands, which make it appear as if it were land-locked. There are several islands, you perceive, in the harbor, all covered with houses, and yards for stocking timber, and with storehouses for barreled fish. Look over toward the opposite continent-for Christiansund is, as I presume you are aware, an island-there, you see the vast barren range of the Dovre Fjeld mountains, their lofty peaks towering toward the sky in every conceivable fantastic form. See the dark masses of cloud resting upon the mountain sides, causing the clear blue sky above to appear singularly bright and dazzling. Look at the variation of light and shade everywhere to be seen on the earth and in the sky, and continually changing. If I were a painter, Harry, it is in Norway that I would endeavor to master one of the greatest difficulties of the art, the effectual disposition of light and shade; but I am wearying you with my talk. You will have time enough by-and-by to study this landscape, and form your own opinion respecting it. Now sit down, and give me a succinct account of all that has transpired since you and I parted in Italy-now two years ago, and I promise not to interpose a word till you have concluded the story." 
               When Harcourt had concluded his narrative, with which the reader is already acquainted, he inquired of Staynor what had induced him to visit Christiansund? 
               "Whim, Harry, whim," was the reply. "I crossed the country from Christiania-at which place I arrived from Stockholm, where I spent the winter-in the month of March. It was a desperately cold journey, I can tell you; but I took it into my head last autumn to spend a winter in these northern regions, just for the novelty of the thing. I reached here in April." 
               "So you wrote me to Hamburg." 
               "Yes, I recollect; and deuced cold it was during the first month I spent here. I could scarcely keep warm, with that great, black monster of a stove filled with pine wood, and kept burning night and day." 
               "You must have been lonesome enough?" 
               "A little in the dumps sometimes; but not often. I muffled myself in furs and went out every day. My host is a capital fellow; you must know him, Harry. He has a charming family. A wife, a son, and two daughters. I spend my evenings with them; then, as the spring advanced, the young man and I, together with other young men of the place, made up shooting and fishing parties, and rare sport we have had, I can tell you. We must get up an excursion purposely on your account. So you see, take it all in all, I have not fared so badly. As soon as you hear from Hamburg, we'll start for Drontheim, which is worth visiting. I passed through the city on my way hither. Meanwhile we'll procure a guide, and explore the Dovre Fjeld together, and after leaving Drontheim, we'll visit Bergen and the Hardanger Fjeld on our way homeward, for I suppose you'll return to England after leaving Norway. By the way, your mother and sister, and your uncle, will be terribly shocked, when they hear of the loss of the Jung Frau.
                   You have written to them, of course, and assured them of your safety?" 
               "No," replied Harcourt; "there was no necessity for so doing. I did not inform them that I intended to visit Norway. I seldom write home, and they believe me to be in France or Germany." 
               "Still, it would be better to write." 
               "There is no necessity," repeated Harcourt. "They care very little where I am, I believe. Alice, perhaps, would be glad to hear from me, poor little thing! but that's all." 
               "Stuff and nonsense! Harry," said Stayner. "You've got a parcel of morbid fancies into your head, which, unless you want to be miserable all your days, you must rid yourself of. Breathe for awhile the fresh, bracing air of this mountainous country; join hunting and fishing parties, and enter heartily into the sport, instead of moping about alone, as you have accustomed yourself to do, and in three months you'll find yourself another man. Just in the degree that you make yourself agreeable to others, you'll find others make themselves agreeable to you. By-the-by, have you ever heard any thing further of Clara Withers?" 
               "Nothing." 
               "I thought you returned from Rome to Florence with the intention of seeing Clara, and hearing from her own lips the cause of the change in her sentiments toward you?' 
               "So I did." 
               "And the result?" 
               "Was that I didn't speak to her. I don't believe she ever knew that I returned to Florence." 
               "You saw her there?" 
               "Yes." 
               "And didn't speak! Harry, don't feel offended when I tell you that in some respects you are the greatest simpleton on earth; but perhaps your own sentiments have changed. There is some other lady?" 
                
               "None. I never intend to marry, Charley. My own family have taught me a lesson in relation to married life, and if I forget it, I shall deserve to suffer the consequences." 
               "You did forget it once in Florence, Harry," said Staynor, archly smiling. 
               "Yes, and ought to be thankful that my eyes were opened in time to the duplicity of womankind." 
               "Pooh, Pooh! The duplicity of womankind! They are better than we are, as a general rule, at all events; and so you will think by-and-by." 
               "Never." 
               "We shall see. My belief is, that if you had seen Miss Withers, or even her mother, every thing would have been satisfactorily explained. But if a man makes himself miserable, he can't complain if the world takes him at his word, and leaves him to his own triste ideas of enjoyment. You wrote in glowing terms of the young woman whom you saw on Sartaroe island. You held a different opinion of her?" 
               "She is innocent and guileless, and generous, because she has been all her life shut out from the world, and has never been taught duplicity." 
               "I fancied when I read your letter, Harry, that you had a penchant for her?" 
               "How could you have entertained such an idea, Charley? If I had, how could I marry a fisherman's daughter? And though I doubt the good faith of women, I do not doubt their virtue, and detest and scorn the name of a libertine." 
               "Bravely said, Harry," said Staynor, grasping his young friend's hand. "There's hope for you yet, I see. You've brooded over some ridiculous theory until you have become imbued with the feelings of a misanthrope of sixty, who has turned misanthrope because the world will no longer believe him to be in the heyday of youth. Such feelings are not natural to you at twenty-two; and, mark my words, you'll be a married man before you're five years older. The reaction will be tremendous with you, Harry," he added, laughingly. 
               Harcourt smiled also, but shook his head. 
               "Let's change the subject," continued Staynor. "How about your late father's estate? Are matters settled yet?" 
               "They are in a fair way for settlement," replied Harcourt. "Two or three years hence and I suppose, from what my Uncle Templeton told me last time I saw him, I shall succeed to the unencumbered estate." 
               "Which is somewhere about ten thousand a year. You are a lucky fellow, Harry. You'll find the need of a wife then. Come; put on your hat, and let us take a stroll through the town. It's small; but a pretty place, well worth seeing, and I have made myself acquainted with every body in it." 
               The two young men walked out for an hour or two, and Harcourt was introduced by his friend to several of the principal residents. Staynor appeared to be a favorite with every body. 
               In the after part of the day they went on a fishing excursion, and the evening was pleasantly spent in the society of the family of their host. 
               During the week a journey to the Dovre Fjelds was undertaken, a large party having been invited, and skillful guides having been hired for the occasion-and hunting, shooting, and fishing excursions filled up the time agreeably for a fortnight. At the expiration of this period, Harcourt received a bill of exchange for five hundred pounds from Hamburg, inclosed in a letter from the banker, who congratulated him upon his happy escape; but Mr. Van Ness had written a brief and hurried letter, omitting to mention the fact that he had previously written an account of the disaster of the shipwreck to Mr. Templeton; therefore, as Harcourt still believed his friends to be ignorant of his visit to Norway, he adhered to his original resolve-not to write until he returned to England. 
               During the week following that in which the letter was received, the young men left Christiansund for Drontheim, at which city they remained for several weeks, amusing themselves in visiting those places in its vicinity most remarkable for picturesque scenery, and thence they embarked for Bergen, with the intention, during their stay in the ancient capital, of thoroughly exploring the majestic range of mountains, known as the Hardanger Fjeld. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIII. 
               THE DRIVE TO THE PARSONAGE. 
               THE month of August was well advanced when Henry Harcourt again found himself in the city of Bergen. Pluming himself upon his partial acquaintance with the city and its immediate vicinity, he now took upon himself the duty of acting as cicerone to his companion, and after having engaged rooms at the well known boarding-house of Madame Sontum-in preference to stopping at one of the hotels, none of which are to be recommended-and partaking of a hearty breakfast, the young men proceeded to pay their respects to the vice-consul, who had acted so friendly a part to Henry on the occasion of his former visit to the city. 
               They were, of course, received in a friendly manner, and the first greetings over, after a brief conversation relative to their past travels and their plans for the future, Harcourt made inquiries respecting his old friends at Sartaroe. 
               "I know but little about them," said the vice-consul; "although they have, I believe, left the island, and are now residing at a small village near the Hardenger Fjeld. The old man-Jansen is his name, is it not?-is growing very feeble and infirm, and the directors of light-houses, in the prefecture of Bergen, have pensioned him off, and appointed some relative of his, a son, or nephew, in his place." 
               "Then it will be difficult to find them out?" said Harcourt. 
               "No, easy enough, by crossing over to Sartaroe, a journey, I suppose, you have no wish to undertake. But the pastor, who occasionally visits the island, resides but a few miles from the city, and from him you will be able to learn where the old man has settled down." 
               "How long is it since they removed from the island?" asked the young man. 
               "It must have been shortly after you sailed for Christiansund. They called at the consulate-the old man and his wife, and a young woman, his grand-daughter, I understood-to inquire after you. The girl wished me to give you her thanks, should I ever meet you again, for a present of books you sent her. She appeared to be a very good, as she certainly is a very pretty girl-far superior to her station in life. A young man with them did not seem to be pleased at the interest she took in your welfare. I should judge him to be her lover, though there was a singular, apparently an involuntary, constraint in their conduct toward each other, as if there was some trouble existing between them, which neither was willing to explain. You will excuse me, young gentleman, when I say that I trust that, during your compulsory residence at Sartaroe, you made no advances to the young woman, which may have led to a difference between her and her lover?" 
               "I did not," replied Harcourt, earnestly. "I was treated with generous hospitality by Christian Jansen and his wife. To the courage and generosity of the girl, under Providence, I am indebted for my life. I was necessarily thrown a good deal into her society, while at the light-house; for the greater portion of the time I had no one else to talk to-and that is all." 
               "I am glad to hear you say this," replied the vice-consul. 
               "The young man who called with Louise at the consulate," continued Henry, "was, I presume, a fisherman of the island-one Rolf Frode. He is an honest, industrious, and worthy fellow. Some time ago, as I understood, he lost his boat, during a storm, and when I received the money I expected from my banker at Hamburg, I sent him, from Christiansund, a sum sufficient to purchase a new boat, as a mark of my regard for him. I have not heard whether he received the money; but he certainly has no reason to entertain any ill feeling toward me." 
               "Well, as I have said," continued the vice-consul; "if you wish to visit the family, you had better drive out to the parsonage of Tunes, the incumbent of which is the Reverend Mr. Bredell. You will find him a fine specimen of the Norwegian clergy. He always took a great interest in this young woman, when he presided over a smaller parish, situated on the coast, opposite the island. You will drive through some of the most picturesque scenery in the vicinity of Bergen, and be made welcome at the parsonage." 
               "What is the distance?" inquired the young man. 
               "About twenty or perhaps twenty-five miles, and as the road is by no means in good condition, and there are no houses of entertainment to be met with on the route, indeed no houses at all, I believe, after you pass the chateau of Baron Von Welden, about ten miles from the city, you had better provide yourselves with refreshments in case you need them before you reach the village of Tunes." 
               "What do you say, Staynor?" said Harcourt; "shall we visit Tunes to-morrow?" 
               "Of course," was the reply. "I am ready for anything, and I am all anxiety to see this fair island maiden, of whom I have heard so much." 
               And so the matter was decided. 
               The young men dined and spent the remainder of the day at the consulate, and on the following morning engaged a carriage and a driver who was well acquainted with the road and started for the parsonage. 
               For the first five miles they passed through a sweet pastoral country, with rich farms on either hand, luxuriant grain fields and orchards which promised crops of delicious fruit; but as they advanced, the scenery assumed a different character, the road winding just on the edge of frightful precipices, and becoming, in some places, so dangerous that, notwithstanding their faith in the surefootedness of the Norwegian ponies which drew their carriage, they thought it advisable frequently to alight from the vehicle and walk. Their progress was necessarily very slow, and to their dismay, a dark mass of cloud hanging over the Hardanger Fjeld, threatened a storm. They had scarcely advanced four miles further before the storm burst upon them. The rain fell in torrents, and the thunder rolled above their heads, each clap a hundred times re-echoed among the mountain gorges and sounding in their ears like one continuous roar. The ponies became frightened. 
               It would have been madness to have proceeded further along a road from which they would have been precipitated a hundred feet into the ravine beneath, if the horses made one start aside. They came to a dead stand-still, and held consultation as to their further proceedings. To go back was as hazardous as to go forward. To stand, perhaps for hours, perhaps for the whole day, beneath the pelting storm and then to proceed on their journey amid the darkness of night, was equally unpleasant and equally dangerous. 
               At length the driver, with considerable difficulty, in consequence of their slight acquaintance with the language he spoke, gave them to understand that about half a mile further, a bylane led to a safer road which would conduct them to the chateau of the Baron Von Welden, where they would readily obtain shelter and hospitable entertainment until the storm ceased and enabled them to proceed on their journey. It was a long way out of the direct road to Tunes, he added; but the gentlemen would doubtless prefer to increase the length of the journey rather than remain exposed to the fury of the storm or risk proceeding further on the dangerous road over which they were driving. 
               "Of course,"said Staynor. "Drive to the chateau. This baron must be a very ogre if he refuse us shelter from such a storm as this." 
               The driver carefully led his horses the short distance to the bylane, where the two young men mounted the carriage, and were driven rapidly to the chteau, which they reached in the course of an hour, drenched to the skin, and in a pitiable plight to pay a visit to the mansion of a nobleman. 
               However, they told their story to the porter, and the gates were instantly thrown open to them. At the end of the avenue which led to the chteau, they were met by some of the house servants, who reported to their master the arrival of two Englishmen who had been overtaken by the storm, and asked for shelter, and in a few moments the baron himself appeared and welcomed them to the chteau. 
               He spoke English fluently, and begged them to make themselves perfectly at home. The horses were taken to the stables, dry clothing was provided for the young men; and before they had perfected their toilets, a message was sent by the baron, inviting them to join him at the dinner-table. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIV. 
               THE BARON AND THE PASTOR. 
               THE Baron Von Welden was a tall, spare man of fifty years. His features were bold and prominent, and, but for an expression of mingled sternness and melancholy, his countenance would have been singularly prepossessing. It was so now when he smiled, on which occasion he displayed a set of teeth whose perfect regularity and whiteness were not in the least impaired by age or disease. 
               His hair was of an iron-gray color, and brushed off his high broad forehead, and the thick moustache, which shaded his upper lip, was of the same hue. A slight stoop was observable in his gait; but it appeared to have been contracted by a habit of fixing his eyes upon the ground in deep thought, rather than to have been the effect of the weight of years, or of infirmity. He had neither wife nor child in the chteau; but it was impossible to infer from his conversation whether or not he had always lived a solitary life-whether he was a bachelor or a widower. He seemed to be guarded in his conversation in this respect, though on every other topic he was frank and open. That his rank was not unsupported by wealth was readily inferred by the elegance and completeness of every thing appertaining to his household. The grounds surrounding the chteau were large, and laid out with taste and skill, and kept in the most perfect order. The chteau itself was an old castellated building of vast size, which might have served as the stronghold of a baron of the feudal ages. It seemed to be so substantially built as to defy the encroachment of Time, and within doors it was arranged and furnished with a degree of elegance and refined taste seldom met with in the country-seats of the Scandinavian gentry or nobility; it might have challenged comparison in this regard with the finest country-seats of southern Europe. The servants were numerous, apparently well trained, and attired in rich liveries; they were evidently mostly from France or Germany, for in the languages of these countries they were addressed by their master. 
               The dining-room into which the young men were conducted by the butler, was of vast size. The floor was covered with rich Indian matting; the wainscoting was of black oak, richly carved, and the chairs and other articles of furniture were of the same material. The table extended nearly the entire length of the room; but the cloth was only laid on the upper end, at which the Baron was seated. He rose from his seat when his guests entered, and again welcomed them to the chteau. 
               "I have but plain fare to offer you, gentlemen," he said in English, when they had taken their seats at the table. "I live plainly myself, from choice, and seldom see company, and there was no time to prepare daintier food; besides, I should have kept you waiting, and, in my opinion, the essence of hospitality consists in promptitude in supplying the wants of those to whom we proffer it. I know it is not the custom in England to drink spirits as a prelude to dinner; but if you have not adopted the custom of this country, it can do you no harm, after the drenching you have had." 
               He filled three liqueur-glasses as he spoke. "To your health, gentlemen," said he, raising his glass. His example was followed by his guests, and the contents of the glasses-excellent French brandy-were swallowed at a draught. 
               Soup was then served, and the tureen being removed, fish and poultry occupied its place. These dishes were succeeded by boiled mutton and roasted venison. After which custards, cakes, and fruits, and a variety of choice wines were placed on the table, together with a supply of excellent cigars. The servants then withdrew, and the conversation which had been carried on during the progress of the meal, was renewed with greater vivacity. The young men were charmed with their host. The baron had been a great traveler, and his conversation was equally instructive and entertaining, while his remarks were never obtrusive; he had not even asked the names of his guests, and betrayed so little curiosity on the subject, that they might have left the chateau without divulging them, had not some casual observation led to the disclosure. Harcourt addressed his companion by his surname, and then, bethinking himself of the unpardonable omission, he said, addressing his host: 
               "Baron Von Welden, it has just occurred to me that we have been guilty of a gross breach of politeness. We have introduced ourselves merely as two English travelers. "We have not yet mentioned our names. Mine is Harcourt; that of my friend is Staynor." 
               "It matters not, gentlemen," replied the baron; but although it was but momentary, and was unobserved by his guests, the host gave a sudden start and looked earnestly at Harcourt as he spoke. 
               They sat long at the table, and when at length they rose, the storm had blown over, and unwilling to trespass too much upon the hospitality of their host, Staynor proposed that they should renew their journey. 
               "By no means," replied the baron. "The road will be almost impassable, after this heavy rain, for some hours to come. You could hardly reach Tunes to-night; besides, your clothing will be scarcely dry; and though my wardrobe possesses no articles of dress that will fit your forms, it is better to wear ill-fitting dry garments than wet ones. I seldom have the opportunity of seeing company. I am almost glad the storm occurred since it drove you to the chteau for shelter. You must remain my guests to-night, and in the morning you shall proceed on your journey." 
               The young men, not unwillingly, accepted the baron's invitation, and the latter then asked them if they would like to see his picture-gallery. 
               "It is not much," he said, "yet there are a few choice paintings, and a number of family portraits, which to me are invaluable. You might prefer to walk round the grounds of the chteau we will do so in the morning before you leave; but now it is too late and the ground will be damp." 
               The young men expressed their desire to see the pictures, and the baron led them to a long room at the further extremity of the chateau, roofed with glass, in such a manner as to throw the most perfect light upon the gems of art which it contained. 
               "Those are landscapes, chiefly of Italian, Swiss, and Norwegian scenery," he said, pointing to the pictures which covered the walls near the entrance end of the gallery. "To my mind there is no scenery finer than the last, though some persons think it too gloomy. You may, perhaps, recognize some of the views. There is the town and harbor of Christiansund, which you have visited, and here is a view taken from a most picturesque point of the Dovre Fjeld, where you have also been. What do you think of them?" 
               The young men expressed their admiration of the correctness of the representations and the beauty of the paintings. 
               "Yes," continued the baron, "I think myself the artist has done justice to the scenery so far as it lies in the power of art to do justice to the sublimity of nature. Here is a view from the summit of one of the mountains of the Hardanger Fjeld; which, of course, you will visit. It is the finest mountain range in the country. These are a series of views from different points of the Hardanger Fjord, and those to the left are Italian and Swiss scenes." They occupied some time in admiring the landscapes, and then the baron led them to the portion of the gallery occupied by the family portraits. 
               "These," he said, "are of course more interesting to me than they can possibly be to strangers, still you may like to examine them. They are the portraits of my ancestors for three centuries back; and there is my portrait, taken ten years ago." There was a shade of melancholy in the expression of his voice, as he added in a lower tone, "it will be the last addition to the gallery." 
               There is always a melancholy pleasure in looking upon the lineaments depicted on canvas, or sculptured in marble, of those who have lived in years gone by, even if their names were unknown to us. We like to see what manner of men and women they were who lived and moved, and smiled and wept, and experienced joy and sorrow, even as we do now, years and years before we opened our eyes to the joys and sorrows of life, and who have long since gone down to the grave, and mingled with the mother earth, to whose cold bosom we must also return. It is strange, too, how, in a collection of family portraits, a family likeness may be traced from the oldest portrait downward to that which depicts the living representative of the race. It was so in this instance. In the male portraits a likeness could clearly be traced-not an actual resemblance in form and feature-but an indefinable family likeness to him who now owned these cherished mementos of his ancestry. It was even observable in many of the female portraits; but there was one picture which, more than any of the rest, attracted the attention of Harcourt. 
               It was not an old picture, nor the portrait of one who had performed her earthly pilgrimage in olden days. The comparative freshness of the coloring showed that it had not, for very many years, stood the test of time; and the attire, compared with that of the other female portraits, was modern. It was that worn by ladies fifteen, or at most twenty years before. But what arrested the attention of Henry Harcourt, was the resemblance the portrait bore to some one-he knew not whom-whom he had seen living. It was a shadowy recollection, like a dream; and yet, like some dreams, it was vivid enough to seem like reality. He was so impressed with the idea that he must have known the original of this portrait, that he turned to the baron and was about to inquire the name of the lady whom it represented; but Baron Von Welden had moved to another part of the gallery, hastily passing by this picture, and was descanting upon the merits of another portrait to Staynor; and as Harcourt advanced to rejoin the other gentlemen, he thought to himself how foolish must be his fancy how could he, at twenty-two years old, have any recollection of the face of a lady who had been dead twenty years, for the baron had mentioned, on entering the gallery, the fact that of all the portraits it contained, the living models of all, but of his own, had been at least a score of years in the grave. 
               They quitted the gallery, and amused themselves until dark with inspecting, under the escort of their host, the various other objects of interest the chteau afforded. The evening was spent pleasantly, and at an early hour they retired to rest. In the morning the baron took them over the grounds of the chteau, and after breakfast they bade farewell to their hospitable host, expressing a hope that if he should visit England he would afford them an opportunity of reciprocating his generous hospitality. 
               The morning was bright and clear, and the road over which they now traveled was no longer beset with the dangers of that over which they had traveled the day before. By the baron's advice, they had taken a different, but a longer route to the village. 
               The scenery on either hand was still delightfully variable and picturesque, and for some miles they sat gazing upon it in silence. At length Staynor was startled from his reverie by an exclamation from his companion. 
               "I have it!" exclaimed Harcourt, almost springing from his seat, in his exultation. 
                
               "Have what; the brandy flask?" said Staynor. "I've been thinking about it. The air blows keenly from off the Fjord, and a slight dram would do no harm." 
               "The brandy flask!" said Harcourt, contemptuously. "No, the portrait." 
               "What do you mean, man? Are you crazy? If you keep jumping about on your seat in that fashion, you'll frighten the ponies. It's well we're not close to the precipice, as we were yesterday." 
               "The picture in the gallery," said Harcourt; "the young lady." 
               "What the d-I are you talking about?" said Staynor. "Have you been robbing the picture gallery?" 
               "No, no; it's you that is talking foolishly. You recollect the portrait of a lady in more modern attire than the rest?" 
               "No; I'll be hanged if I do." 
               "You must have observed it. It was so exceedingly beautitiful!" 
               "I tell you I didn't; and as to beauty, I saw nothing but a parcel of grim visages, painted on canvas, blackened and dusty with age." 
               "Nonsense, Charley. There was one portrait which particularly attracted my attention. It seemed to me that I had known the original. You might not have observed it." 
               "Well, what then? It's quite possible that you may some time or other have seen somebody like the picture." 
               "You have heard me speak of Louise Sigvald?" 
               "I rather think I have," said Staynor, laughing. "So the picture's like her, eh? Upon my word I long to see this paragon of feminine loveliness. She has sent your wits woolgathering, Harry. Don Quixote was not more enamored of his ideal Dulcinea, than you of this young Norsk maiden. Now don't get angry. I don't want to quarrel, and, sooner than fight, I'll humbly acknowledge that the peerless maid of the light-house is handsomer than ever woman was, is, or ever will be." 
                
               "Cease your foolish banter, Charley," said Harcourt. "I have never pretended that Louise was any more than an artless, pretty peasant girl, and the portrait does not in the least resemble her." 
               "Well, then, pray explain what you do mean." 
               "I have never mentioned to you, Charley, that Louise possesses a gold locket, which contains a portrait painted on ivory. That portrait resembles in every lineament the portrait in the baron's picture gallery. I saw the miniature but once. It was on the evening before I left the island; but it made a great impression upon me. I seemed, as was the case when I looked upon the portrait in the gallery, to have a perfect recollection of the features, even of the expression they wore, and yet, for the life of me, I can't recollect who it is they so closely resemble." 
               "Now, by George! your wits are rambling," said Staynor, laughing outright. "Your island sylph, a lowly fisherman's child, has in her possession a gold locket, containing a miniature painted on ivory. Imprimis, a costly trinket to be in the possession of a young woman in her station in life. Secondly, that portrait resembles a picture in the possession of Baron Von Welden. May be-such a thing is possible. Thirdly, you fancy that, sometime in your life, you have seen a living person who resembled both portraits-quite likely. Now, what is the conclusion at which you arrive?" 
               "Merely that it is strange that these portraits should make such an impression upon me." 
               "Nothing strange about it. The singularity is that you should weave such a romance out of what is, most likely, mere fancy, after all. Here you have yourself, Louise Sigvald-the daughter of a Norwegian fisherman, and the Baron Von Welden, all mingled together in romantic confusion. I advise you now to set to work and weave a novel out of these materials. You have the foundation for a capital plot." *  *  * 
               "Tunes, herren," exclaimed the driver, pointing with his whip toward a straggling village a short distance ahead. "Where shall I set the herren down?" 
               "At the parsonage. I suppose that's the cottage there, near the church," said Staynor. "Ask where Pastor Bredell lives." 
               This was soon learned from one of the villagers, and in another minute the carriage stopped opposite the gate of the parsonage, and the travelers, alighting from the vehicle, introduced themselves to the pastor, who appeared at the door, curious to discover who it was that had paid him this unwonted visit. 
               The young men were made welcome, and Henry Harcourt related to the pastor the particulars of his adventure at the island of Sartaroe, and said that the object of his visit to the parsonage was to find out the place whither the light-house keeper and his family had removed. 
               Mr. Bredell had heard the particulars of the shipwreck, and of the rescue of the young Englishman, from Christian Jansen. He congratulated the young man upon his providential escape from a watery grave, and informed him that the light-house keeper had gone to reside in a small village at the head of the Fjord. 
               "Is it far from this?" demanded Harcourt. 
               "A long distance; fifty miles at least, and the land route is both difficult and dangerous." 
               "How then had we best proceed thither? I should like to see the family again, before I leave the country." 
               "You will, of course, visit the Hardanger Fjeld?" said the clergyman. "All travelers who come to Bergen do." 
               "Certainly, we shall," was the reply. 
               "Then you had better return to Bergen and hire a vessel to convey you to the head of the Fjord; that will land you near the base of the mountain range and close to the village in which old Christian Jansen lives." 
               "Thank you," said Harcourt. "Now, if you please, we will rest our horses a while, before we start on our return to Bergen-" 
               "Rest awhile!" ejaculated the pastor. "Rest awhile! You do not think of returning to Bergen to-night? The thing is impossible. Yes, you must come in, and make my home happy to-day. You will sleep here, and on the morrow you shall return to Bergen." 
               The young men feebly remonstrated; they could not think, they said, of imposing themselves as a burden upon the clergyman; but the good pastor would hear of no denial. It was a pleasure, a rare pleasure, to him, he said, to see strangers. His wife and daughters, too, would want to hear the news from the world beyond their retired seclusion. They would never forgive him if he allowed the strangers to go without partaking of their hospitality. Besides it was impossible to reach Bergen by night-fall, and the road, after dark, was dangerous. 
               The young men made but a faint remonstrance. They knew that to return to the city that day was next to impracticable, and they were doubtful whether there was any house for miles around but that of the pastor's, where they could procure lodgings for the night, unless they were content to put up with the rudest accommodation. 
               They suffered the clergyman to conduct them into the house, and leaving his guests in the parlor, he shortly returned with his wife, a middle-aged matron, the very personification of content and good-humor, and his two daughters, pretty, unassuming girls, of seventeen and fourteen, who received and welcomed their visitors with a cordiality and an absence of pretension or affectation which it was refreshing to witness. 
               The visitors were shown into a bedroom to wash their hands and arrange their toilets, and informed that dinner would be ready in half an hour. 
               "Two pretty girls, the pastor's daughters; are they not, Charley?" said Harcour, as soon as their host had retired. 
               "Yes," replied Staynor. "Not much duplicity about them, I should think. Confess now, Harry, that your absurd and libelous theory respecting women, has undergone a change since you have made acquaintance with the maidens of this country." 
               "They are artless and unsophisticated because their simple habits of life shield them from the temptations which might induce them to become otherwise," was the reply. 
               "I like to see a man stick to his opinions through thick and thin," said Staynor, laughingly. "But, Harry," he continued; "do these young ladies remind you of any picture you have seen?" 
               "Hold your tongue, Staynor," replied Harcourt. "I will never make a confidant of you again." 
               "Because I am not susceptible to shadowy impressions, I suppose, eh, Harry?" 
               The clergyman now appeared to escort them to the parlor, where wine and coffee were handed round by the young ladies, as a prelude to the more substantial refreshments which they were shortly to partake of, and in half an hour dinner was announced. 
               After dinner the pastor, accompanied by his daughters, walked out with their visitors, the clergyman pointing out to the young men all that was worth seeing in the village and the adjacent neighborhood. When they returned to the parsonage the supper-table was spread, and after supper the young ladies and their mother occupied themselves with their needle-work, while the clergyman and his guests entered into conversation on various subjects, the ladies, being interested listeners, and occasionally interposing a few words themselves. At an early hour the ladies retired, and spirits and water and pipes being produced by the clergyman, the gentlemen occupied another hour in social chat, the conversation now turning upon the family of the light-house keeper, who had been the cause of the young men's visit to the parsonage. 
               "Yes," said Mr. Bredell, who, we should observe, spoke English with sufficient fluency to carry on a conversation with perfect ease; "yes, she is a good child, Louise. She was alway a favorite of mine. I have known her from a little girl of ten years. Before I removed hither, I often crossed over to Sartaroe to visit the fishermen and their families." 
               "Louise," observed Harcourt, "was betrothed, as I understood, to Rolf Frode, an honest young fisherman of the island. Do you know if she is yet married?" 
               "No, I suspect not; though Rolf, whom I knew well, was with them when they called upon me, on their way to old Christian Jansen's native village. He intended to settle, with his sister and her family, at the head of the Fjord. By the way, he mentioned that you had sent him money to buy a boat; the poor fellow was quite overjoyed. He can find employment for it on the Fjord, to greater advantage than on the coast." 
               "I suppose, then, since Rolf and his sister have removed with Jansen's family, the marriage will shortly take place?" 
               "I don't know. There is some difficulty existing between them, with the particulars of which I am unacquainted. Indeed from what I gathered from Hilda Welden, I fancy they don't know exactly what it is themselves. It appears that Carl Jansen, the present keeper of the light-house, heard something during his last trip as a pilot which threatened an obstacle to the marriage. At all events, Hilda Welden told me-the young couple were very reserved on the subject themselves-that they had promised Carl not to marry for twelve months, and then not without his consent." 
               "You mentioned Hilda Welden. Now I recollect, I fancied I had heard the baron's name somewhere before. Hilda's is the same as his." 
               "Not exactly," said the pastor, smiling; "Welden is not an uncommon German name, nor is Sigvald, and both the husband of Hilda and the father of Louise were of German descent. Von Welden is altogether another thing. 'Von' is a prefix implying noble birth." 
                
               "Another singular coincidence to introduce into your chapter of romance, Henry," interposed Staynor, looking archly at his friend. 
               "The Baron Von Welden, at whose chteau we stopped last night, is a German, then?" 
               "Yes, by descent, if not by birth; but if he was born in Germany, he has been a long time in this country. He is now a Norwegian in heart and feeling. It is to his friendship that I am indebted for this Praestegarde, or parsonage. He owns large estates in this neighborhood, and is one of the judges of the Supreme Court of Bergen." 
               "Has he never married?" 
               "Not that I am aware of. Intimate as I am with him, he has never mentioned the subject to me." 
               "It struck me, when his countenance was in repose, that a melancholy expression rested upon it." 
               "Yes," replied the clergyman, "I have remarked it ever since I have known him, now for a period of ten years. I have often thought that he labored under some secret sorrow which he can not, or will not divulge." 
               "He is highly esteemed in the neighborhood?" 
               "No one more so. There is not a more finished, nor a more highly educated gentleman; nor a better landlord; nor a more just judge; nor a more excellent magistrate in all Norway. I omitted to mention that he is the Sorenshriver-as the justice of the peace is termed here-for this district." 
               "You speak of him in terms of high eulogy," said Staynor. 
               "No one better merits them," replied the pastor; "but come, my young friends; it is growing late, and it will not answer for me, the pastor of this parish, to set a bad example to my flock by keeping untimely hours, and you have a long and tedious journey before you to-morrow. Let us retire for the night. I will show you to your bedrooms." 
               The pastor lighted his guests to the chambers provided for them, and wishing them good-night and pleasant dreams, left them to their repose. 
               On the following morning, after breakfast, the travelers bade farewell to the inmates of the hospitable parsonage, and set forth on their return to Bergen. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XV. 
               PREPARING TO ASCEND THE HARDANGER FJELD. A WARNING AND A MYSTERY. 
               AWAY to the Hardanger Fjeld. Away! light hearted and lightly burdened with luggage, but not lightly clad, for the climate is no sunny one, even in mid-summer, and the heats of the day are rapidly succeeded by the chills of the night. A few hours-a single hour, often carries the traveler from the depths of the sultry valley to the breezy summit of some mountain peak. A "light heart" is a capital thing to bear in one's bosom, whether one travels or remains at home; but "a thin pair of breeches" would not answer very well to travel with in Norway. Away, happily, in this instance, not light-pocketed; though, for the matter of that, if a full purse is not to be despised under any circumstances, a light purse-always provided it be not too light-will carry the traveler a long way in the country of the Norsemen, if due economy be observed. 
               Away, then, to the Hardanger Fjeld, equipped with a warm suit of clothing, and a stout walking-stick, and a knapsack to sling across the back; health and strength, a good conscience, a merry heart, and a tolerable supply of dollars in the breeches pocket, are all else that is needed. 
               It was the morning of the second day after the return of Harcourt and Staynor to Bergen, from their visit to the parsonage of Tunes, when the two young men stood on one of the wharves of the city, bargaining with a fisherman to convey them in his boat from the harbor of Bergen to the head of the Hardanger Fjord. 
               "No, Rolf, we will not accept your offer of a passage up the Fjord without payment," said Harcourt. "I esteem it fortunate that I met with you. I did not expect to do so, although the pastor of Tunes told me that you now employed yourself in navigating the Fjord, instead of fishing in the strait, as you used to do. My friend and I will pay you as we would any other boatman." 
               "Be it so, if you insist, Herr Henry," was the reply of the young fisherman; "but it is to your generosity that I am indebted for the boat, and hearing that you had returned to Bergen, I made bold to call at Madame Sontum's, where I thought it likely that you might be stopping, to thank you for your kindness, and to place my boat at your service." 
               "Nothing could have pleased me better, Rolf. My friend and I engage your boat. When will you be ready to sail?" 
               "With the turn of the tide, this afternoon, Herr Henry." 
               "Good! At what hour will that be?" 
               "At two o'clock." 
               "Then we will be on board at half past one. Now, good morning. We will return to Madame Sontum's, and make preparations for our journey." 
               "Good morning, Herr Henry. The boat will be ready at that hour, and I will polish her up, and make her fit for the crown prince to voyage in." 
               At half past one o'clock Harcourt and Staynor stepped on board the Louise Sigvald-the trimmest fishing-smack in the harbor of Bergen; and, receiving from a waiter from the boarding-house, who had followed them to the pier, a couple of well filled, but not over-stocked knapsacks, were all ready for their projected trip, in the first place to the hamlet of Kongshun, where Christian Jansen resided, and thence to the plateau of the Hardanger Fjeld. In half an hour the little vessel was under weigh, and bounding merrily and swiftly before a gentle breeze along the coast, toward the mouth of the Fjord. 
               Rolf was assisted in the navigation of his boat by a young lad of fourteen, the young fisherman and he comprising the entire crew. By nightfall they had worked, aided by the tide, to the mouth of the Fjord; and the water being now smooth, and the wind fair, the energies of the two navigators, which had been taxed to the utmost in beating the boat against the wind, and taking advantage of every change of the tide, were now permitted, in some measure, to relax. 
               The air was warm; the moon and stars shone brightly over the heads of the voyagers, and the weather promised to be remarkably fine. Harcourt and Staynor, who had stretched themselves upon a mattrass in the stern of the boat, now lit their cigars, and producing a flask of spirits, and a couple of horn tumblers from one of the knapsacks, made preparations to enjoy themselves for a few hours before retiring for the night to the small cabin allotted to them. 
               "Come, Rolf," said Harcourt, "your work is over for the present: let the boy Ol take the helm, and sit yourself down beside us and join us in a glass and a cigar, and let you and I talk of old times. I have hardly had time to inquire about my old friends of Sartaroe yet." 
               Rolf willingly accepted the invitation. Harcourt handed him his cigar-case and the brandy-flask, and the three young men entered into conversation together. 
               "So, Rolf, you think you will do well on the Fjord; better than you used to do on the coast?" said Harcourt. 
               "Yes, Herr Henry," replied the young fisherman; "at any rate during the summer months, now that, thanks to you, I have a boat of my own. There is good fishing in the Fjord, and occasionally gentlemen hire my boat for pleasure parties, and sometimes travelers engage me to take them from Bergen to the Hardanger Fjeld." 
               "Have many travelers visited the Hardanger Fjeld this season?" 
                
               "A good many, Herr Henry. I have taken a party of four to the head of the Fjord." 
               "And it affords you numerous opportunities of seeing Louise?" said Harcourt. 
               Rolf hesitated before he replied; then he said, 
               "Yes, and others likewise." 
               "Who?" asked Harcourt. 
               "Hans Petersen and Erik Lodbrok," said Rolf. "They, too, have taken to the Fjord since the light-house keeper removed from Sartaroe." 
               There was an evident indisposition on the part of the young fisherman to converse upon the subject, and the young men spoke of other matters. Indeed the extraordinary, though wild and savage beauty of the scenery as the Fjord grew narrower, afforded ample interest to beguile the time, and after awhile few words were spoken. The sheet of water on which they were sailing was confined between rocks of fearful height. At one point overawed by frowning mountains; at another dotted with islet-like mounds of earth, resting upon its bosom. 
               Again it assumed the appearance of a lake, surrounded with every variety of beautiful scenery, and then became the receptacle of the various cataracts which poured from the adjacent heights, while the waters were so transparent that it seemed as if the eye could penetrate to the depth of a hundred fathoms; and the mountains, precipices, cataracts, and rocky islets were mirrored in the water with singular vividness, affording a display of inverted submarine scenery, equal in beauty to that which it reflected, above the surface of the Fjord. 
               It is a distance of more than seventy miles from the mouth to the head of the Fjord, and the passage occupied three days. Toward the close of the third day, Rolf came aft from the fore part of the boat to the tafferail, where the passengers were seated. 
               "There," said he, pointing ahead to where the Fjord seemed to be suddenly arrested in its course by a semicircle of rising hills covered with firs, "there is the head of the Hardanger Fjord. In the rear of those hills rises the range of the Hardanger Fjeld, and there," pointing to a straggling hamlet, "is Kongshun, where you will find Christian Jansen." 
               In the course of another half hour the smack was brought to an anchor opposite a wharf which, built on piles, extended some fifty yards into the Fjord, and the skiff being launched, Harcourt and Staynor were landed at the hamlet of Kongshun. 
               Rolf Frode remained behind to set his boat in order, while the young travelers walked into the hamlet. By dint of inquiry they soon ascertained where Christian Jansen had taken up his abode, and a quarter of an hour's walk carried them thither. 
               As they approached the cottage, they noticed that it was superior in size and in outward appearance to the generality of the dwellings in the hamlet. Christian Jansen had saved money during his long residence at Sartaroe, and was, according to the estimate of wealth among the simple-minded people of the hamlet, a rich man. 
               A garden surrounded the cottage, well stocked with such hardy vegetables as could endure the vicissitudes of the Norwegian climate; and the vegetable beds were profusely adorned with such flowers as would bloom in this northern clime; mountain wild flowers, gorgeous in coloring, and indigenous to the country, but so beautiful that had many of them been transplanted in the gardens of southern Europe, they would have been regarded in the light of rare exotics. Waving fields of grain, now nearly ripe, and rich with their brown and golden hues, perfected a pastoral scene which would have led the observer to imagine that he was looking upon some richly-cultivated farm in a land favored with warm sunshine for the greater portion of the year, were it not that he had but to cast his eyes around and above him, when the black, frowning rocks, the hills covered with forests of dark Norway pine, and the towering mountains, piled "Alps on Alps," as far as the eye could reach, speedily dispelled the illusion. 
                
               As the young men drew nearer the cottage, they saw a woman sitting in the door-way, facing the garden, engaged in knitting, and presently a younger female form arose from behind a clump of evergreens, where she had been stooping to gather flowers, as was evident from the bunch of buds and blossoms she held in her hands. 
               The younger female was dressed in the usual red boddice and white skirt; but the cap, or colored handkerchief, usually worn as a head-dress, was dispensed with, and in place of it her head was protected from the sun's rays by a broad-brimmed straw hat of a dark color, similar to the gipsy hat often worn by the country belles of southern Europe, and of America. A glimpse of the neat, compact and graceful figure, satisfied Harcourt that it was Louise. 
               She had seen the strangers approaching, and for a moment she stood gazing toward them, shading her eyes with her hand. In another moment she exclaimed, 
               "Grandmamma, here is Herr Henry," and running to meet him, she extended her hand, and frankly offered her cheek to his salute, expressing, in broken sentences of Norsk and English intermingled, her joy at seeing him again. 
               In her delight she had forgotten the presence of the stranger, but becoming aware of it after the first excitement occasioned by unexpectedly seeing Harcourt, had subsided, she blushed and turned bashfully away. 
               "A friend of mine, Louise," said Harcourt. "Will you not also bid him welcome?" 
               "He is welcome to Kongshun," said the young girl, frankly extending her hand to the young man. "But," continued she, addressing Harcourt, "will not you come in to the cottage, and see my grandfather and grandmother? they will be glad to welcome you." 
               Accompanied by Louise, the young men entered the cottage, and Harcourt was heartily welcomed by the old light-house keeper and his wife. He then introduced his friend, and stated that they expected to take up their quarters for some days at Kongshun, as they intended to visit every object of interest in the vicinity of the Fjord, and also to explore the neighboring mountains. In reply to a question from Harcourt as to the possibility of obtaining lodgings in the hamlet, old Jansen offered to lodge them at his cottage, which contained more room than his family occupied. The offer was promptly accepted, and after partaking of the simple refreshments offered by Margaret Jansen, they walked out to see the hamlet, under the guidance of old Christian. Before leaving the cottage Harcourt conversed awhile with Louise, who had assisted her grandmother in preparing the food of which they had partaken. 
               A blush of excitement and surprise had overspread the countenance of the young girl when she first caught sight of the visitors, but now that it had subsided, Harcourt noticed that her face was paler than usual and that she looked anxious and ill at ease. 
               He asked her how she liked her change of residence. 
               "Very well, Herr Henry," she replied, "though I miss much the walks I used to take on the cliffs, and hear not any longer the noise of the sea. It is so quiet here." 
               "Perhaps you miss the society of your old friends, Louise? though I fancy you did not receive visits often." 
               "No, not so much; they are mostly here. Rolf has brought his sister to live here. That is Hilda's cottage you see there, near the wharf; and others from the island come here often; but the Fjord is so quiet and the valley beneath these high mountains is so silent ever. It is lonesome." 
               There was a sadness in the tone of the maiden's voice, as well as a weariness in her looks, which surprised and affected the young man. He recollected the meeting with Carl, the evening before he left Sartaroe; the interview that subsequently took place between Carl and the betrothed lovers; the unwonted agitation of Louise on the following morning, and the information he had received from the pastor of Tunes, and he charged the low spirits of the maiden to another cause than that of regret at quitting her abode on the rocky island. 
               "Your island sylph is certainly a pretty girl, Harry," said Staynor, as they strolled through the hamlet; "but she is not the cheerful, gleesome creature I expected to see. She seems dispirited and languid." 
               "And is so, I have no doubt," returned Harcourt. "You recollect the story we heard from the pastor of Tunes?" 
               "Something about 'the course of true love never does run smooth,' wasn't it? Some estrangement between the girl and her lover, eh? I wonder whether the girl is at fault this time, Harry? Whether this estrangement has arisen out of any duplicity on her part?" 
               Harcourt turned away, pretending not to hear the banter of his friend, and joined old Jansen, with whom he entered into conversation respecting his new mode of life. 
               The hamlet of Kongshun was, in the opinion of Harcourt, scarcely a more desirable abode than the rocky island of Sartaroe. It consisted of some fifty or sixty cottages, spread over an area of two square miles. The inhabitants appeared generally to be poor, deriving their support solely from the fishery the Fjord afforded. Those only who had boats of their own adapted to ocean navigation, were raised above the necessity of laboring for their daily food-or starving. The fish caught during the summer and autumn months, with the exception of that required for immediate consumption and that salted and dried for winter use, was sold to the owners of boats, and by them carried to Bergen for sale. These latter thus saved a little money, while the rest of the population of the hamlet lived from hand to mouth. Still there was no abject poverty. Food could always be obtained by those who worked for it-and there were no idlers. 
               The scenery around the hamlet was, however, magnificent beyond conception to those who have passed their lives on tamer soil. 
                
               On one hand was seen the Fjord, narrowed to the breadth of a small river, its miniature billows washing the beach in close proximity to the hamlet. The waters of the Fjord were darkened by the shadow of a large rock which rose perpendicularly on the opposite shore to the height of several hundred feet. The rain-water, draining from the mountains above, had forced a passage through several clefts in this rock, whence it fell in a range of cataracts into the Fjord. A succession of hills, which elsewhere would have been styled mountains, but which were overtopped by the loftier range of the Hardanger Fjeld, formed the background of the picture. The sides of these hills were covered with forests of dark-green fir-trees, rearing their lofty heads above each other, and vying in height with the steep ridges with which they were blended. Even the plain on which the hamlet was situated was broken by undulating ridges of bare rock and vast pieces of morass, and its general aspect was wild and sterile; but in more sheltered spots, and in southern exposures there were signs of verdancy, the more agreeable from the sterility with which they were surrounded. The majority of the houses were constructed of loose stones or of pine logs, brought with great toil from the base of the mountains. Few men were to be seen in the hamlet; they were mostly away fishing in the small punts with which the Fjord was thickly dotted. A few cows and goats rambled at will among the cottages, from which, as the strangers passed by, women and children came forth and gazed with curiosity upon them. It was after sunset before the party returned from their ramble, and when the young men again entered Jansen's cottage, Harcourt was surprised to find there several of his Sartaroe acquaintances. Hilda Welden, Erik Lodbrok, and Hans Petersen were seated around the table upon which supper was spread; but the meal was untouched. They were waiting the return of Jansen and his English guests. Before the meal was ended, Rolf Frode joined the party. 
               The fishermen expressed their delight at again meeting Harcourt court, or Herr Henry, as he was universally termed by them; but it was evident, although there was no open expression of animosity, that there was a feeling of ill-will among the young men, arising, as Harcourt suspected, out of feelings of mutual jealousy. The changed demeanor of Louise, who scarcely possessed a vestige of her former sprightliness, was more marked, from her evident endeavor to assume a cheerfulness she did not feel, than it had been when the travelers first arrived at the cottage, and shortly after supper she retired with Hilda Welden. Harcourt and Staynor joined the party of young fishermen, who remained at the cottage until a late hour, talking, singing, and carousing. 
               From what Harcourt-who had already attained to some proficiency in the Norsk dialect-could understand, since the removal of Christian Jansen from the light-house, and the acquisition of a fishing-boat of his own by Rolf, Hans and Erik had both chosen to pursue their occupation on the Fjord, and consequently both paid frequent visits to the hamlet of Kongshun, where Jansen's cottage was their usual place of resort, with what object Harcourt readily surmised. 
               Hilda Welden remained at the cottage all night, but Rolf left with his companions, and shortly after they had gone Harcourt and Staynor retired to rest. 
               On the previous evening the travelers had mentioned their intention of ascending the Hardanger Fjeld, and had expressed a desire to procure a second guide, Rolf, who had once or twice ascended the mountains, having arranged to accompany them during their passage up the Fjord. Erik, who had also made the ascent, offered to join the party, and his offer was accepted. 
               Harcourt arose in the morning before his friend, and walked out into the garden which surrounded the cottage, where he met Louise and Hilda, who had just returned from milking the cows. He advanced toward them, and greeted them. 
               "I fear you were not well last night, Louise," he said. 
               "Why, Herr Henry?" 
                
               "You looked pale and dispirited, and retired so early. Indeed, I observed when I first met you yesterday, that you did not seem so cheerful as you used to be when at Sartaroe." 
               "Yes, yes, I am well, very well," she replied; and then, as if to belie her words, she turned her head aside, and burst into tears. 
               Harcourt was both surprised and annoyed. Surprised at the agitation of the girl, and annoyed with himself for having been the innocent cause of it. Presently she again turned toward him, and said: 
               "You will think me foolish, Herr Henry. I am well-yes, quite well in bodily health; but, here-here," pressing her hand on her bosom. "Something that I can not speak of, pains me here. You set forth to ascend the Hardanger Fjeld to-day; I will see you, and bid you God-speed on your journey before you go." She entered the cottage with Hilda, who presently returned and rejoined the young man. 
               "At what hour, Herr Henry, do you set forth for the mountains?" 
               "As soon after breakfast as possible; as soon as our guides are ready," was Harcourt's reply. 
               "My brother Rolf goes with you?" 
               "Yes, and Erik Lodbrok." 
               "Herr Henry," said Hilda, "I could wish that Hans Petersen or some other young man had been engaged to join your party instead of Erik." 
               "Why so?" demanded Harcourt, "Erik is stout and bold, and has ascended the Fjeld before." 
               "I know-at least I have heard so; but-"she hesitated for some moments, and then continued, "Herr Henry, will you see that no quarrel arises between Rolf and Erik? Rolf is highspirited, and sometimes Erik is rude and overbearing." 
               "They shall not quarrel if I can prevent it," said Harcourt; "but why this alarm?" 
               "I do not like Erik," was the reply. "Louise does not like him; yet he persecutes her. He is a pilot, not a fisherman; yet he has left his pilot-boat to lie idle in Sartaroe bay this season, and has occupied himself in fishing in the Fjord, because Rolf has removed hither." 
               After a pause, she continued, "are you armed, Herr Henry?" 
               "Why do you ask?" demanded Harcourt, surprised at the singularity of the question. 
               "Because Louise has told me that she has heard Erik speak threateningly about you. She has requested him not to visit the cottage, still he comes; and the stupid fellow has taken it into his head that you, when at Sartaroe, turned Louise against him. He has said that he wishes you had been left to perish in the storm." 
               "I am much obliged to him for the kind wish," said Harcourt, laughing, and showing the butt-ends of a pair of pocket-pistols; "I always carry these with me when I travel," he added, "and I do not fear any difficulty. Those were, I suspect, mere idle words of Erik's; but tell me, Hilda, what has occurred to make poor Louise so miserable? She is sadly changed within these three months." 
               "I can not tell; I scarcely know myself, Herr Henry. It may prove to be a mistake; I hope so for Rolf's sake. Perhaps you will learn before long." 
               Staynor now emerged from the cottage. 
               "You have got the start of me this fine morning," said he, addressing Harcourt, and at the same time bowing to Hilda, who bade him good-morning, and re-entered the cottage. 
               "So you have been enjoying a tte--tte with Madame Hilda, Harry? said Staynor, when the young woman had retired. "Was it with that object in view you arose so early?" 
               "Hilda Welden is a remarkably well-educated woman for her position," said Harcourt. 
               Staynor laughed aloud. "Another island princess, I suppose," he said. "Have you discovered in Hilda Welden a resemblance to any lady of your acquaintance in other lands? Have you any shadowy recollection of having seen her counterpart before? or, perhaps, you may recollect some portrait in the galleries of Florence, or Paris, to which she bears resemblance?" 
               "Nonsense, Charley; harping still on the same subject. But I have something to say to you-have you remarked any thing peculiar in Erik Lodbrok?" 
               "And who is he with the outlandish name?" 
               "The young pilot whom we engaged last night to accompany us with Rolf, in the ascent of the Hardanger Fjeld." 
               "Ah, I recollect; a tolerably good-looking, but a rough, bullet-headed fellow. Yes, I remarked that he appeared to be the rudest of the set of rude fellows with whom we spent the evening; and that he seemed able to drink more brandy-vin, or whatever they call the abominable stuff, than any two of his companions, without showing the effects of the debauch." 
               "Is that all? Well, then, I will tell you what I have just heard from Hilda." *  *  * 
               "Upon my word, Henry," said Staynor, when he had listened to his friend's recital, "they are a strange set-these island friends of yours. Why you have in Erik-what's his name?-a new character for your romance, or play. It would make a famous drama, and Erik would suit for the villain of the piece." 
               "Then you think seriously-you are always making a joke of every thing, so that I never know when you are in earnest-you think seriously there is nothing in this warning of Hilda's?" 
               "Nothing! to be sure not; some silly fancy of the girl's. Let him be what he may, he looks like a serviceable fellow; and there are two of us, stout and strong, and Rolf may be trusted. Three to one is great odds; besides the idea is folly. What can it benefit him to injure us?" 
               "Perhaps you are right," said Harcourt, and the conversation took another turn. 
               Shortly afterward the two friends returned to the cottage, where they found breakfast prepared, and the meal was scarcely concluded before Rolf and Erik arrived, fully equipped for the journey. The simple cottagers bade the party God speed in their somewhat hazardous exploit, and expressed a hope that they would return in safety; and thus they set forth to accomplish the ascent of the Hardanger Fjeld. 
               They had provided themselves with a portable tent, which could be erected at night so as to afford them shelter, for they expected the journey would occupy three or four days. Rolf had brought a kettle and saucepan, and other necessary culinary articles from his smack; a supply of provisions was packed in one of the knapsacks, and all other necessaries were provided-the heavier articles being carried by the guides. They were thus fully equipped to make the ascent as comfortably and satisfactorily as such an arduous exploit could be accomplished. 
               Three days the party had been absent. On the morning of the fourth day, Christian Jansen, who was beginning to look out for their return, saw, by the aid of his telescope which he had brought with him from the light-house, a solitary figure descending a declivity of the mountain range. The news soon spread through the hamlet; others peered through the spyglass, and very soon it was ascertained that Rolf Frode was returning alone. This circumstance, however, occasioned no disquietude: he might be in advance of the party, or the others might have preceded him and be nearer the hamlet than he, although not visible. 
               Still there was no little anxiety manifested for the arrival of the young men, and in the course of an hour Rolf made his appearance in the hamlet. He was evidently weary and travelstained, and to the inquiries of the villagers who accosted him, he replied by inquiring if Herr Henry or the others of the party had returned? 
               "No," was the answer he received, "they have not have you lost them?" 
               "Yes," answered Rolf, distractedly, as, foot-sore and breathless less with fatigue, he hastened onward to the cottage, the inmates of which had assembled in the garden to meet him. 
               "Jansen, Louise, Hilda, Herr Henry has not yet returned, they say," was his response to their greetings, as brushing past them, he entered the cottage and threw himself upon a settle, almost in a fainting condition. 
               "Good heavens! no. What is the matter, Rolf?" exclaimed Hilda. "They are safe? Nothing has happened? No accident?" 
               "No, I hope not; but I feel faint; bring me a glass of water." The water was brought, and the young man stretched forth his hand to receive it, and as he did so his sister exclaimed, 
               "You are hurt, Rolf; there is blood upon your hand, and your clothes, too, are stained with blood! Tell us what dreadful thing has happened?" 
               The question was vainly asked: while Hilda was speaking the glass had fallen from her brother's hand, and he fell backward upon the settle in a state of insensibility. His cap fell from his head, and displayed a severe wound on his forehead, such as would have been the result of a fall against the sharp edge of a rock. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XVI. 
               ACCUSATION. 
               ROLF'S hat had dropped from his head as he fell back, fainting, on the settle, and a ghastly wound was observable on his forehead just below the hair, from which the blood trickled down; but slowly, for the wound had been tightly bound with his handkerchief, and the blood had become clotted. Help was speedily summoned, and the wounded man was borne to a more comfortable resting-place. Louise hastened to bring more water and such other simple restoratives as suggested themselves to her. Her face was pale; but she gave way to no extravagant emotion. For a moment, when the young man fainted, her lips trembled, and her throat swelled as with a sensation of choking, but she overcame the fright occasioned by the sudden shock, and exerted herself to the utmost for the relief of the sufferer. 
               In removing Rolf from the settle to the easy couch in an adjoining apartment, it was percieved that the blood on his hand came from a wound in the arm. A hole was observable in the sleeve of his jacket, around which the cloth was singed, as if a musket or pistol had been fired close to the wounded limb. The sleeve of the jacket was quickly ripped open, and it was then percieved that a pistol-bullet had passed through the fleshy part of the arm just below the elbow. Fortunately it was but a flesh-wound, for there was no surgeon to be found nearer than Tunes, and the skill of the simple inhabitants of the hamlet would have scarcely sufficed to set a broken limb, or to perform any complex surgical operation. The wound was cleansed and bound up, and an opinion passed by old Jansen-who had some experience in gun-shot wounds in his early life, when he had served in the Norwegian navy-that it would not prove very serious. Meanwhile Rolf had recovered from his swoon; but his senses were wandering; he talked wildly, and was unable to recognize either Louise or his sister Hilda, or any others among the friends who surrounded his couch, and in this condition he remained during the rest of the day. Toward nightfall he fell into a restless slumber, from which he awoke at intervals to partial consciousness, only to relapse immediately into insensibility. Throughout the night Hilda, Louise, and the light-house keeper and his wife sat by the bedside of the sufferer, the younger watchers anxiously attentive to his wishes, and never for an instant closing their eyes-the old couple occasionally refreshing their less active watchfulness with a short nap. In the morning the young man awoke in a raging fever, raving in delirium. Worn out as were the young women with fatigue and want of sleep, they would not leave him for a moment. They, as well as old Jansen and Margaret, were beginning to grow doubtful of his recovery, and mingled with their fears on this score, was an eager anxiety to learn the particulars of the accident, of which they were yet perfectly ignorant. In his delirium he called on Hans Petersen on Erik, on Herr Henry, and fancied that he was still scaling the precipices of the Hardanger Fjeld. Then his wild fancies took another form; he believed himself to be again on the island of Sartaroe, the accepted lover of Louise, and in the midst of a fancied conversation with her, he would grow furious, endeavor to rise from his couch, and denounce Herr Henry and Erik and Carl Jansen for having plotted against him, and combined to separate him from the object of his love Louise shuddered as she listened to these denunciations, not because she attached importance to them or believed them to be any thing more than the ravings of delirium; but she had heard it already surmised that some dispute had occurred during ing the journey over the mountains, and that there had been foul play on one side or the other, for gossip and scandal, everywhere busy, had invaded this secluded hamlet. The betrothal of Louise and Rolf was known, and a score of rumors, all false and improbable, had been circulated in relation to the circumstances which had occurred to prevent the consummation of their marriage. 
               Hilda was anxious likewise. She had warned Harcourt of Erik, and, although she had perfect confidence in her brother, she feared that the quarrel she had foreboded had actually occurred. 
               At daylight in the morning a party had set forth to scour the mountains and endeavor to discover the three young men who had not yet returned, and as soon as the dangerous condition of Rolf was known, a messenger had been sent to Tunes for medical assistance. 
               Toward noon the fever somewhat abated and Rolf again sank into a quiet slumber, in which he had not lain an hour before news was brought that the party which had set out in search of the missing travelers were returning in company with them. In the course of half an hour they reached the hamlet, the entire population of which was abroad to meet them. The return of Rolf in a wounded condition was an event in this secluded, quiet valley, and not one of the fishermen had on that day busied himself in his regular occupation. 
               A thousand questions were eagerly asked as the party entered the precincts of the hamlet, and strode rapidly onward toward Jansen's cottage; but no reply was vouchsafed. In the midst of the six men who had set out in the morning in search of the missing travelers walked Staynor and Erik Lodbrok both travel-stained and pale with fatigue, but there was a stern expression on the countenance of Staynor which seemed to bid defiance to the weariness under which he evidently labored. All that the eager villagers could learn was that the young Englishman who had been under the guidance of Rolf had not been found, and this they knew of themselves, for had he been found he would have returned with his fellow-travelers. 
               The party reached the light-house-keeper's cottage, which they entered without ceremony. Then Straynor spoke, 
               "Rolf Frode is here?" he said, fiercely. 
               "Yes," replied Hilda, who had quitted the apartment occupied by her brother, to warn the new-comers that he was sleeping, and to beg them to be silent. 
               "I charge him with the murder of Henry Harcourt!" exclaimed Staynor, disregarding alike the warning and the appeal, and speaking in a voice of thunder. 
               "Never, never; my brother Rolf is no murderer!" replied Hilda, turning pale as she spoke; but expressing in the tone of her voice, and the firmness with which she met the fearful charge, her perfect consciousness of her brother's innocence. 
               A suppressed shriek was heard to proceed from the inner apartment, and Louise rushed out, exclaiming, 
               "It is false-false! Rolf could not be guilty of crime!" 
               "I charge Rolf Frode with murder and robbery!" repeated Staynor. "Here," he added, addressing the crowd which had filled the room and gathered in front of the cottage, "here is my friend's pocket-book, rifled of the money which I know it to have contained when we left the hamlet together; and here is one of his pistols. It was but recently discharged when we found it in a spot where a violent struggle had evidently taken place." 
               While Staynor was speaking, Erik had taken Rolf's jacket, which had been stripped from him, from the nail on which it hung, and plunging his hand into the deep breast-pocket, he drew forth a pistol, still charged, a counterpart of that produced by Staynor. 
               A groan of mingled horror and execration burst from the excited crowd, and Hilda sank fainting to the floor of the cottage. Twenty tongues united with Staynor in denouncing the murderer, and calling for vengeance, as the young Englishman pressed forward toward the inner apartment, as if with the intention of seizing the alleged criminal, who, utterly exhausted with the fever and delirium of the morning, still slept through all this uproar, happily as yet unconscious of the dreadful charge preferred against him, and of the damning proofs of guilt produced by his accusers. 
               Again Louise spoke; her limbs trembling; her face ashy pale; her lips white and quivering, and her voice so choked with emotion that her words were scarcely intelligible. She advanced to Staynor before he had crossed the threshold of the bedroom. 
               "Herr Staynor," she said, placing her trembling hand upon the young man's arm, her fingers nervously twitching at his coat sleeve, "you know not Rolf Frode as I know him; as Hilda, his sister, knows him. No, Herr Staynor. It is not he who is a murderer. He is sick and wounded-perhaps dying-"for a few moments she was unable to continue her speech, but overcoming her emotion she resumed, "Herr Staynor, you are an Englishman; they say in Norway your countrymen are generous and brave. Would you kill Rolf, and yourself so commit murder? See! come into this room with me. Satisfy you that I tell true. He can not, if he would do so, now escape you. Do as you will; but wait. He will prove he is innocent." 
               The pleading look, the earnest voice, scarcely audible, yet so expressive of a deep conviction of the truth of the words she uttered; the pale face and quivering lips of the trembling girl, in some measure calmed the passion of the excited young man; perhaps for a moment he thought that she was correct in her belief of Rolf's innocence; but, if so, it was but for a moment: the proofs of his guilt were too strong. Still he pitied her.
                
               "My poor girl," he said, taking her trembling hand in his own, "I am sorry for you, indeed. I would be glad, if what you say were true. I will enter the room with you and see Rolf. If he is in the condition you say he is, I will leave him unmolested now, and in your charge; but I must avenge the murder of my friend. Under any circumstances, were Harcourt not my friend, I must do my duty." 
               He followed Louise into the room, while he was speaking. Rolf was lying at full length on the couch, with all his clothing on but the jacket, which Erik had taken down from the nail in the outer room. His pale face was turned toward Staynor, and the stains of blood were visible on the bandages which bound his brow and arm. Occasionally he moved uneasily, as if suffering pain, and gave utterance to some unintelligible words, as if his mind were still wandering in his dreams. As the young Englishman looked upon the strongly-marked, but handsome features of the wounded man, now more refined and gentle in expression-in consequence of the pallor which overspread his face, still increased by its contrast with the profusion of dark hair which curled over his forehead-than he had ever observed them to be before, his heart almost misgave him. He doubted if that was the countenance of a murderer. But, in a moment, he scorned his own weakness. Turning away, he again took Louise by the hand and led her out of the room. 
               "My poor girl," said he, when they had reached the outer apartment, "I am sorry for you, indeed! Rolf shall remain unmolested, until he is able to be interrogated, and shall be under your and his sister's care. The constable of the hamlet must be responsible for his safe keeping, until the Sorenshriver of the district is apprised of the matter; but I will take care that he does not enter the room Rolf occupies. I hope, for your sake and his sister's sake, he may be able to prove his innocence." 
               Although Staynor spake thus, in the humane endeavor to calm the agitation of the young women, it would have been apparent to a careful observer, from the expression of his countenance now that he had quitted the bedside of the suspected man, that his full belief in Rolf's quilt, which had wavered as he looked upon him, had returned; but Louise had listened to the kind words, and, as unable to express her thanks, she raised her head and looked up in his face, and thanked him with a wishful, hopeful, appealing glance, and a faint blush, more eloquent than words, the young man felt that he would give much if Rolf could indeed prove his innocence. 
               Erik was standing in the doorway of the cottage, talking loudly in his native tongue with the crowd which still hung around, and, as Staynor understood the language sufficiently to know, was boasting triumphantly of the part he had played in discovering the proofs of the murder. The young man sternly rebuked him, in English, for his officiousness. 
               "What," said Erik, in a tone which savored of insolence, himself speaking in English, "is the Herr sorry that he has found the murderer of Herr Henry?" 
               "No, sir," replied Staynor; "but this is no place and no time to speak in that unfeeling way of a charge which is as yet not proved-and in the presence of the unhappy man's sister, too," looking as he spoke, toward Hilda, who, recovered from the swoon into which she had fallen when she heard her brother denounced as a murderer, was a sitting by the side of Margaret Jansen, her head resting on the old woman's shoulder, and sobbing violently. "Bid this crowd disperse," he continued, addressing the official who occupied the post of constable in the hamlet, "and leave the unfortunate family to themselves. You, sir, will hold yourself responsible for the safe keeping of Rolf. No one else has any business here." 
               Overawed by the young man's manner, and by his superior social position, the crowd dispersed of their own accord, leaving the cottage to Jansen and his family, and the constable; and this matter accomplished, Staynor asked Louise, who had followed him to the doorway, whether medical assistance had been sent for? 
               "Yes," was the reply. 
               "Then," he answered, "tell Hilda that I will pay the expenses of the doctor's attendance;" and again pressing the hand of Louise, and bidding her hope for the best, he proceeded to the wharf, engaged a boatman to convey him down the Fjord to the landing-place, whence he could proceed by the most direct route to the residence of the nearest magistrate, and, accompanied by Erik, immediately took his departure from the hamlet. 
               Rolf slept, almost without intermission, throughout the day and the greater portion of the night. When at length he awoke, though he was still feverish and light-headed, he was evidently much better; and when, on the following morning, the doctor arrived at the hamlet, he was so far recovered as to satisfy that functionary that no fatal result was to be apprehended. The doctor, however, insisted upon the patients' being kept perfectly quiet, and free from any thing that might cause excitement, and thus he remained in the sick chamber, with Hilda and Louise and Margaret for his nurses, and with the constable in the outer room; yet still ignorant of the critical position in which he was placed, and of the dreadful charge that had been preferred against him. 
               Very soon he recovered his senses sufficiently to relate to Louise and Hilda the particulars of the loss of Harcourt, and the accident which had befallen himself. There was great anxiety felt by the residents of the hamlet to know these particulars; but no communication with Rolf was permitted by the constable, who, indeed, refused himself to hear the statement from Hilda, asserting that the law forbade him, or any other officer, to listen to any confession or exculpation from the lips of a prisoner, until he had been brought to trial. 
               In the course of a few days Rolf was able to sit up. Meanwhile a warrant for his arrest and removal to Bergen had reached the hamlet, and at the expiration of a week, the doctor declared his patient to be sufficiently recovered to listen to the charge preferred against him, and to be removed to the capital. 
               The effect of this astounding information, however, was such as for some time to lead the medical man to fear a relapse, which, he said, would be in all probability fatal. Several times during his approach to convalescence, Rolf had inquired whether his companions to the Hardanger Fjeld had returned. He was informed that they had, and had gone to Bergen. 
               "Has Herr Henry returned?" he had inquired. 
               "The party have all returned to Bergen," was the evasive answer, and with this he was compelled to be satisfied. 
               Now, when he learned that nothing had been heard of Harcourt, and that he was charged with the crime of murder, he became for some time perfectly frantic. 
               He vehemently protested his innocence; but, at length, after having been assured by Hilda and Louise, and Jansen and Margaret, that they believed him innocent, and should retain that belief, let what might be the result of his trial, he gradually became more composed, and, accompanied by his sister, and Louise, and old Jansen and his wife, embarked on board the sloop which was to convey him to the Sorenshriver's court, at Tunes, for preliminary examination, amidst the honest and loudly-expressed sympathies of the inhabitants of the hamlet, and buoyed up with a hope, which, in the opinion of his sympathizing friends, was engendered by conscious innocence. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XVII. 
               THE TRIAL. 
               THE Baron Von Welden, as has been heretofore observed, was the presiding judge of the Stift, or Supreme Court of the District of Bergen. He was also Sorenshriver-answering to the position of a county magistrate-of the parish in which his estate was situated, which included in its limits the hamlet of Kongshun, where the alleged assassin was arrested. The crime, however, was one of such magnitude as to lead the baron, after briefly examining the prisoner, and taking the depositions of the witnesses, to consign him to the city prison of Bergen, there to await his trial. 
               The Supreme Court-the Regis Ret-was to sit in the course of the ensuing week, consequently the detention of the prisoner in jail was only sufficiently long to enable him to arrange his defense, and to allow the prosecutor to subpna his witnesses. This, however, did not occupy much time. Rolf had neither the means nor the inclination to employ counsel. He resolved to defend himself, and simply to relate the story he had already related to his friends. With the nature of the evidence against him the reader is already cognizant. 
               Although great sympathy was felt for the prisoner at Kongshun, where he was well known, an entirely different feeling prevailed in Bergen. The city owed much of its prosperity to the visits of tourists during the summer months; and the fact of a traveler having been murdered by a mountain guide, under whose protection he had placed himself, was calculated to create mistrust in the minds of tourists, and consequently to lead to a falling off in the number of travelers who might otherwise have wished to ascend the Hardanger Fjeld. 
               Accidents had frequently occurred to travelers while making the perilous ascent, but never before had a guide betrayed his trust and become bandit and assassin. Human nature is the same everywhere, and not a few of the respectable burghers of the capital would have rejoiced to see the prisoner punished with the utmost severity, whether proved guilty or not. 
               They had already satisfied themselves of his guilt, and made up their minds that the infliction of the utmost penalty the law allowed would inspire a wholesome dread in the minds of future guides, and serve to restore the confidence of tourists. 
               The day appointed for the trial arrived. The court-house was crowded to excess long before the judges took their seats on the bench. At a table in the center of the court and in front of the seats occupied by the judges, sat the district counselor, surrounded by a dozen or more of the leading counsel of the city, all engaged in eager discussion upon the prospects of the approaching trial. 
               Presently a bell tolled from the turret of the court-house. The officers of the court commanded silence. Half a dozen constables in official uniforms entered, and cleared the way for the judges, who in a few minutes were to be seen wending their way through the main isle of the crowded court-room to the bench at the upper end, in the solemn dignity befitting their high office, and amid profound silence. They were followed by four assessors or assistant judges, with whom the superior judges are accustomed to take counsel. The assessors were distinguished from the judges by their black silk gowns-the judges being robed in scarlet trimmed with ermine, and when the latter had taken their seats-the Baron Von Welden, as presiding judge, in the center-the assessors ranged themselves on either side of the bench. 
               While the preliminary business of the court was being disposed posed of, the spectators occupied themselves in conversation relative to the approaching trial, or in gazing at the prisoner, who stood in a small dock, railed off in front of the bench, with a constable on either side of him, and in full view of every person in the court-room. 
               Rolf had recovered from the effects of the wounds he had received; but he was still very pale, the joint effect of his recent illness and his sense of the awful position in which he was placed. Many and divers were the opinions expressed regarding his personal appearance. The greater portion of the male spectators already discovered that he had a vile, hang-dog look, which ought of itself to condemn him unheard. He was just the man whom, from appearance, they would believe to be capable of committing the atrocious crime laid to his charge. With the female spectators it was otherwise. They generally thought him a handsome, honest-looking youth: the last person in the world whom they would suspect to be guilty of a cowardly or criminal action. The sympathies of the female spectators were strong in his favor. 
               Many persons endeavored to single out the witnesses, but, with the exception of Louise, and Hilda, who occupied a seat by her side, both of whom were evidently witnesses from the prominent position they occupied in the body of the court, the curiosity of the spectators on this score remained ungratified. The male witnesses had mingled with the crowd, from the midst of which it was impossible to individualize them. 
               The penalty, should the prisoner be found guilty, was imprisonment and hard labor, in chains, for life-capital punishment has long been abolished in Norway-but this punishment is a living death, more dreadful to suffer than the short shrift of the confessor and the speedy release of the hangman's rope. 
               The trial was one of rare occurrence in Bergen. The lesser crimes are not more rare there than in other lands; but it is not often that a criminal is arraigned to answer to a crime of blood. 
                
               The crier of the court called for silence, in a stentorian tone, and the Baron Von Welden, the presiding judge, addressed the prisoner in the following words:
                     In the description of the trial, the author wishes to state that he writes from a recollection of that which he witnessed in the court-house of Bergen, several years ago. The main incidents of the trial are true, and to the best of his recollection he has related the method in which it was conducted: of course the proceedings differ materially from those of the courts of this country.
                  
                
               "Rolf Frode, listen to the charge preferred against you. You are accused of the murder of Herr Henry Harcourt. What say you; guilty or not guilty?" 
               "Not guilty, Herr Baron," replied the young man, boldly and firmly, though there were symptoms of trepidation in his looks, as he glanced furtively toward the spot where Louise and Hilda were seated. 
               "Not guilty, you say, Rolf Frode?" said the judge. "May God give you release. The district counselor will now state the circumstances which have led to the prosecution." 
               The district counselor rose from his seat and amid the most profound silence, proceeded to deliver himself as follows: 
               "Herr Baron, and my lords judges: the prisoner, Rolf Frode, is charged with having, on the -- day of August last, with evil intent taken the life of and English tourist, with whom he associated himself as guide on a journey, the object of which was the ascent of the Hardanger Fjeld. I believe, Herr Baron and my lords judges, that I have ample evidence to secure a conviction, and to prove that something more than a mere desire to despoil the murdered man of his personal property, led to this atrocious action on the part of the prisoner. 
               "I shall prove base ingratitude and malice aforethought. I shall prove the attempt on the part of the prisoner to force himself upon his unfortunate victim, in the capacity of a guide, when he had no claim to engage himself as such. I shall endeavor to show that there were reasons-although these reasons sons were based upon false suspicions and nurtured by black-hearted jealousy-sufficient to induce a man destitute of moral principle, regardless of obligations rendered, and maddened with smothered yet ill-concealed passion, to commit the diabolical crime of which the prisoner at the bar stands accused. 
               "It is not necessary, Herr Baron and my lords judges, to bring forward the testimony of persons who actually saw the deed of blood perpetrated. A murderer in heart watches his opportunity, and does not commit the deed he has long premeditated, in the sight of others. He watches his opportunity when the eye of his Creator, whose majesty-perhaps whose existence, he ignores-is alone upon him, and strikes the deathblow at a moment when he believes he has isolated himself and his victim from all human companionship. It will be enough, Herr Baron and my lords judges, to condemn the prisoner if I show, as I feel myself qualified to do, that the circumstantial evidence I am about to bring forward affords as strong proof of the prisoner's guilt, as if the bloody and cruel deed had been witnessed by every person now present in this court-room. I will say no more at present, my lords judges, but will wait until I hear the statement of the prisoner's counsel, when I will bring forward such evidence as will, I have no doubt, scatter to the winds every endeavor that may be made to acquit the prisoner of the charge, and will lead the jury to bring in a verdict that will consign the guilty man at the bar to a life-long penance, which although wrought out with mental agony, as enduring as the corporal slavery to which he will be consigned, will be all too lenient a penalty wherewith to expiate his horrible crime." 
               "Rolf Frode," said the baron, when the counselor had taken his seat, "whom have you appointed among these learned counsel to conduct your defense?" 
               "No one, Herr Baron," replied the young man. "My story will be briefly told, and no counsel, that I could name, could add or detract a sentence from it." 
               There was a murmur throughout the court-house; the women thought this resolve, on the part of the prisoner, to conduct his own defense, a proof of his innocence: the male portion of the audience considered it to be merely a scheme to gain sympathy, or a further proof of the obstinate self-will and recklessness of his character. 
               The judges whispered together for a few moments, when the baron desired the prisoner to proceed with his defense. 
               "Herr Baron, my lords judges and honorable assessors," said Rolf, "I stand before you charged with a dreadful crime, of which I am guiltless-at the very thought of which my nature revolts." 
               "Please you, Herr Baron and my lords, the prisoner has already pleaded not guilty. This repetition is irrelevant," interposed the district counselor. 
               "Allow the accused to tell his story after his own way, Herr Graaffen," replied the judge. "Proceed, prisoner," addressing Rolf. 
               "Herr Baron," continued Rolf, "the gentleman of whose murder I am accused, was wrecked, nearly three months ago, off the neighboring island of Sartaroe. The vessel he was on board of, went to pieces on the rocks; I, aided by some of my comrades, one of whom is now one of my accusers, saved his life. Entangled in a mass of wreck, he was drifting out into the open ocean, when in the midst of the tempest we put out to sea, and succeeded in bringing him ashore in safety." 
               "This really has nothing to do with the case in question," again interposed the prosecuting counsel. 
               "Let the accused proceed without interruption, Herr Graaffen," said the baron. 
               "For some weeks, Herr Baron and my lords," continued Rolf, "he remained a resident of the island, living in the cottage of Christian Jansen, the light-house keeper. Meanwhile he wrote to certain friends, making known to them his distressed condition, and received assistance from them, to enable him to prosecute his intended tour. The day after he quitted the island I was informed that he had promised Louise Sigvald, the grand-daughter of Christian Jansen, that he would send me, from Christiansund, money wherewith to purchase a fishing-boat for myself." 
               "Permit me to ask, Herr Baron," again interrupted the district counselor, "how it happened that the deceased gentleman informed Louise Sigvald of his generous intentions toward the prisoner; and why he did not rather inform the prisoner himself of the favor he intended to confer upon him?" 
               The baron bowed, and Rolf proceeded to state that he had had little intercourse with Herr Henry, of whose murder he was accused, during his stay on the island, and that he was absent from the island at the time when Herr Henry made the generous promise to Louise. 
               "You did not see the deceased gentleman before he quitted the island, then?" said the counselor. 
               "Yes, honorable sir," replied Rolf, "I saw him the night before he left, and I saw him embark on the following morning; but I was not then aware of the generous offer he had made." 
               "I understood you, prisoner, to say you were at the time absent from the island?" inquired the baron. 
               "I had set out with a party of my comrades a day or two previous on a fishing cruise, Herr Baron," replied Rolf; "but I returned to Sartaroe with Carl Jansen, the uncle of Louise, the night before Herr Henry sailed from the island." 
               "Is it usual for fishermen who have departed on a cruise, to return on the following day, or the day after?" inquired the district counselor. 
               "No, honorable sir, it is not customary," replied Rolfe. 
               "Will you state to the court, then, how it happened that you returned on this particular occasion?" 
               "I met with Carl Jansen, who had been long absent, shortly after leaving Sartaroe, and boarded his pilot-boat, when he told me something which led to my forsaking my comrades, and returning to the island with him." 
                
               "What was the nature of the information he gave you?" demanded the district counselor. 
               "I am ignorant of that, even now." 
               "And yet it was of sufficient importance to compel your return?" 
               "Yes, honorable sir." 
               "Was it not something in relation to Louise Sigvald?" 
               The prisoner was silent. 
               "Answer me, sir," said the counsel; "was it not something in relation to Louise Sigvald? Did not the news you then heard prevent the marriage that was anticipated between you and Louise?" 
               "It did," replied Rolf. 
               "And yet you assert that you are ignorant of its purport?" 
               "Yes, honorable sir; ignorant of its general purport. It prevented the immediate union of Louise Sigvald and myself." 
               The counselor laughed, derisively, and was again called to order by the bench. 
               "Let the prisoner proceed without interruption," said the baron. 
               "Certainly, Herr Baron; but I wish the court to take notice that the prisoner confesses to a betrothal having taken place between himself and Louise Sigvald; that a speedy consummation of the marriage was anticipated, and that it was broken off in consequence of some information received from a stranger, on the eve of the deceased gentleman's departure from the island, on which, during his stay, he had been in constant communication with Louise Sigvald." 
               "Proceed, prisoner," said the baron. 
               "Herr Baron," continued Rolf, "on the evening of the day on which Herr Henry sailed from the island, I again left, and joined the party of fishermen to which I was engaged. We were absent six weeks, and on my return I received a letter from the English consul at Bergen, informing me that he had been commissioned to purchase a fishing sloop for me, by the English Herr. The boat was purchased, and shortly after this Christian Jansen resigned the keepership of the light-house in favor of his nephew Carl, and Christian removed, with his wife and Louise Sigvald, to Kongshun, in the valley beneath the Hardanger Fjeld. Possessed of a boat of my own, and knowing that the Hardanger Fjord abounded with fish, which I could bring to a profitable market at Bergen, I resolved to make the Fjord the scene of my labors during the summer; and whenever I had leisure, I took the opportunity of visiting Christian Jansen at his new residence in Kongshun, at the head of the Fjord-" 
               "And Louise Sigvald," interrupted the counselor. 
               "And Louise Sigvald, honorable sir," said Rolf, "since she continued to reside with her grandfather." 
               "This is intolerable," said the baron; "I insist upon the prisoner's being allowed to continue his relation without further interruption by the counselor." 
               "Less than a fortnight since," continued Rolf, "Herr Henry returned from Christiansund, in company with another English traveler. I heard of his arrival, and called at the British consulate to see him and thank him for his generosity toward me. He and his friend engaged my boat to convey them to Kongshun, both being desirous to ascend the Hardanger Fjeld, and on the night of his arrival at Kongshun, he engaged me and Erik Lodbrok as guides to accompany himself and his friend in the ascent of the mountains-" 
               "Are you acquainted with the mountain passes?" inquired the baron. 
               "I have thrice made the ascent of the Hardanger Fjeld, Herr Baron, and have been accustomed to mountain travel from my boyhood," replied Rolf. 
               The baron inclined his head, and Rolf proceeded with his story: 
               "On the following morning we set forth, our party consisting of four, myself and the Herr Henry Harcourt, and Erik Lodbrok and the Herr Staynor. 
                
               "The ascent was for some time very agreeable; the day was fine, and we encamped for the night on the summit of the Ster, on the north-west flank of the mountain range, where we erected our tents, and slept comfortably, after having partaken of a supper prepared by Erik and myself. The next morning, at an early hour, we again started forward, and by noon had gained the highest practicable summit of the Fjeld. After remaining here for some time, we prepared to descend, and during our descent our party separated, Herr Henry, who was very venturesome, continually remaining behind to scale some precipice which attracted his notice. As I considered myself his guide, I remained with him, and Herr Staynor and Erik proceeded onward. Toward noon we approached the base of a black, ugly peak, which the Herr Henry insisted upon ascending, although the side rose from the valley almost perpendicularly, and the ascent was, in fact, impracticable. I never heard that any tourist, or mountaineer, had ascended that peak. I remonstrated, but Herr Henry insisted. He threw off his coat, and desired me to take charge of his pocket-book and his pistols, saying that he would attempt the ascent alone. I knew he would fail; that the ascent was impracticable, and I waited in the valley, anticipating his speedy return. 
               "In a few minutes I heard him call for help; and rushing forward in the direction of the sound, I saw him clinging to the branch of a beech-tree which overhung a precipice over which he had slipped. The depth of the ravine beneath him was a hundred feet, and at the bottom, as I well knew, was a sluggish lake of unfathomable depth. He again called to me in a feeble voice, declaring that his strength was exhausted, and that he would soon be compelled to relinquish his hold of the bough Horror-stricken at the sight, I only thought how I could best afford him the succor he needed. I cast away his coat which encumbered my movement, and the pocketbook inside fell out, burst open, and its contents were scattered around; but I heeded not the money then, my only thought was to rescue the young gentleman from his perilous position. Recklessly disregarding my own safety, I attempted to clamber up a steep precipice, from the summit of which, if gained, I could let down one of the cords belonging to the tent, which I had about me, and by the aid of which the unfortunate gentleman could regain a position of safety; but when about half way up the almost perpendicular ascent, I heard a cry of despair, and the next moment a crash told me that the branch had given way with Herr Henry's weight, and that he had been precipitated into the ravine. A sensation of faintness came over me, and I missed my own foothold, and fell from the height I had gained to the sloping platform beneath. I struck upon my head, and cut my brow severely. The blow rendered me senseless, and the instinct of self-preservation alone saved me from rolling down the slope, and falling into the ravine beneath. 
               "I suppose that I clutched at the grass and herbage to save myself, and that in my struggles one of the pistols intrusted to my care by Herr Henry was discharged, and bounded from my belt in the discharge; for, when I recovered my senses, I-was lying bleeding on the verge of the ravine. I had received a shot wound in my arm, in addition to the wound on my forehead received in falling, and was sick and faint from loss of blood. One of the pistols, too, was missing. Weak and wounded as I was, I managed to clamber down the ravine, and searched for some traces of Herr Henry, whom, however, I did not expect to find alive. I could not find him, nor could I discover any spot which showed traces of his fall. Night came on while I was still engaged in my hopeless search. Faint in body, and sick at heart, I crouched down beneath the shelter of an overhanging rock, and there lay till daylight. Whether I slept or not I can not say; the night passed I know not how. It seemed interminable, and yet I have no recollection of the minutes or hours. I believe I again became partially unconscious. When day-light appeared, I toiled my way back to the hamlet, which I reached almost prostrated with pain and weariness. I have no recollection of reaching Christian Jansen's cottage. I recollect nothing further until I awoke, as if from a trance, and found myself in bed, attended by my sister and Louise Sigvald. I then inquired after my companions, and was told that they had returned from the Fjeld, and had gone back to Bergen. I was confined to my bed for several days; and when at length I begun to grow stronger, I was informed that the Herr Staynor and Erik Lodbrok had accused me of the murder of the Herr Henry. Again I say I am guiltless of the dreadful crime of which I am accused." 
               The prisoner was silent. His plain, straight-forward narrative had evidently favorably impressed the court and audience, although certain of the spectators, who were determined to believe in his guilt, only saw in it an audacious endeavor to clear himself of the charge preferred against him, by means of an improbable story. 
               The judges conferred together for the space of a minute, and then the baron said, addressing the district counselor: 
               "We are ready, Herr Graaffen, to hear the evidences of the witnesses whom you intend to bring forward." 
               "I call Herr Staynor, my lords judges," said the counselor. 
               "Herr Staynor, stand forward," said the crier of the court, in a loud voice; and the young Englishman took his place in the witness-box. 
               A slight movement of recognition passed between the young man and the baron, and then the latter said: 
               "Herr Staynor, you are an Englishman?" 
               "Yes, Herr Baron." 
               "Your baptismal name is Carl?" 
               "Charles, Herr Baron." 
               "Yes, Charles. The deposition states, Herr Charles Staynor, that you accompanied the Herr Henry Harcourt in the ascent of the Hardanger Fjeld?" 
                
               "Yes, Herr Baron; I have been the companion of his travels since leaving Christiansund, until the fatal catastrophe on the Hardanger Fjeld." 
               "Swear the witness," said the baron, addressing the officer to whom that duty belonged. 
               The oath was administered, and then the baron said, 
               "Herr Staynor, you will now state to the court all that you know in relation to this unfortunate occurrence." 
               The testimony of Charles Staynor was to the effect that Erik, the guide, and he, had parted company from Harcourt and Rolf, that each might better enjoy himself according to his own inclination. Henry Harcourt was inclined to scale every rock and mountain peak he came across, while he preferred to rest himself and enjoy the magnificent prospect spread before him. Erik and he had seated themselves on the brow of a hill, resolving to wait there and rest themselves, while Rolf and Harcourt mounted a rocky precipice, the base of which might have been half a mile distant from the spot where they were seated. They had been waiting, perhaps an hour, and were anxiously expecting the return of their companions, when they were alarmed by the report of a pistol. The sound reverberated among the mountains to such an extent that they were unable to satisfy themselves from which direction the original report proceeded; but fearing that some accident had happened, they immediately started in search of their missing friends in the direction of the peak which Harcourt had declared it his intention to ascend. For two or three hours they searched in vain. They saw no one, nor received any reply to their frequent shouts. At length, being quite wearied out, they sat down to rest themselves, and after resting for a short time again renewed their search in opposite directions. All, however, was of no avail, and night came on without their having discovered any traces of Harcourt or Rolf. They wrapped themselves in the folds of their canvas tent and slept till morning, when they again renewed their search, each as before going in an opposite direction. 
               In the course of an hour he (Staynor) was alarmed by a loud shout from Erik. He turned back and retraced his steps, and in half an hour came up to Erik, whom he found standing, pale and excited, on a slope at the base of a precipice. There were evidences of a fearful struggle having taken place on this spot. The grass was torn up by the roots in several places, and the ground and herbage were stained with blood. This was particularly apparent near the edge of the slope which overhung a deep ravine, at the bottom of which was a lake or stream of water. On the extreme edge the grass was pressed to the earth as if some heavy body had lain upon it or been dragged over it. He advanced as near as he dared-crawling upon his hands and knees to the edge of the slope and looked over into the depth beneath, but could discover no traces of his friend or the guide; indeed if either or both had fallen over, they must have fallen into the lake beneath. 
               While he was still in this position, he was startled by another cry from Erik, and regaining his feet, he perceived that Erik had found a pocket-book, rifled of its contents, which he recognized as having belonged to Henry Harcourt, and a discharged pistol-one of a pair which Harcourt was accustomed to carry with him-the report of which had no doubt occasioned the alarm they had experienced on the previous day. Erik trembled violently, and he (Staynor) was for some time so much agitated that he was obliged to seat himself upon the turf before he regained strength to continue the search for further evidence of the fate of his friend." 
               Erik and he crept to the edge of the slope, and after a narrow inspection discovered a garment resembling the coat which Harcourt had worn, hanging on the projecting branch of a shrub about midway between the brink of the precipice and the water. 
               No doubt remained in his mind as to the unhappy fate of his friend. Further search he felt to be useless. He had doubtless been robbed and murdered by his treacherous guide, or why these evidences of a violent struggle on the slope? Whence the report of the pistol, and how came the discharged weapon to be found on the ground? How came his friend's coat to be torn from his back and cast into the ravine? or the empty pocket-book to be found among the grass? 
               He thought it possible that his friend had been attacked and wounded by his guide, and that in the struggle which had subsequently ensued, as was proved by the condition of the ground, both had fallen into the ravine together. If otherwise, if Rolf had succeeded in disentangling himself from the death-grip of his victim, he thought he would scarcely have the effrontery to return to the hamlet, but would probably be lying in concealment among the mountains. Resolving to leave no chance of arresting him unemployed, he gave one of his own pistols to Erik, charging him to fire if he should chance to come across Rolf, and the latter should refuse to surrender, and retaining the other pistol himself, the guide and he started in opposite directions, and scoured the mountains during the whole day, having arranged to meet at certain specified places occasionally to compare notes and determine upon subsequent proceedings. 
               That day's search, however, was fruitless, and the night again overtook them among the mountains. 
               They now relinquished all hopes of tracking the assassin, and believing that he had perished with his victim, they resolved to give up the search and to return to the hamlet on the following morning. At daylight they accordingly started on their return, and had not proceeded far when they fell in with the party which had come out in search of them. 
               From this party they heard of Rolf's return to the hamlet, and thither they hastened, and caused the arrest of the assassin. 
               Staynor, although he had struggled to maintain his composure, had become very much excited during the delivery of this evidence, and his story evidently went far to overthrow the favorable impression made by Rolf's own account of Harcourt's disappearance. 
               "Are you aware, Herr Staynor," asked one of the judges, "what amount of money was in the pocket-book of your friend? Was it a sum sufficient to tempt the accused to perpetrate the crime with which he stands charged?" 
               "It contained only a few specie dollars," was Staynor's reply; "only sufficient to defray the trifling expenses likely to be incurred during the journey to the Hardanger Fjeld and back to Bergen; but I do not imagine that the accused had any knowledge of the amount of money in my friend's possession at the time." 
               "There had been no previous dispute between Herr Harcourt and the guide?" said the baron, interrogatively. "There was likely to be no other motive to lead to the perpetration of the crime, but that of plunder?" 
               "I have heard, since I returned from the Hardanger Fjeld, that there might have been another, and a stronger motive, Herr Baron," was Staynor's reply; "but I am not competent to speak regarding it. I shall leave that testimony to other witnesses, who know more about the matter than I." 
               "You can retire, Herr Staynor," said the judge. "Herr District Counselor, produce your next witness." 
               The counsel handed a paper to the crier of the court, who read the name written thereon, and called Erik Lodbrok to the stand. 
               Erik Lodbrok being duly sworn, corroborated the testimony of the former witness, repeating, in fact, almost the very words in Danish which Staynor had spoken in German. It was remarked, alike by the court and the spectators, that Erik's voice trembled, and he became very much agitated when he spoke of the discovery of the pocket-book and the discharged pistol. 
               "Erik Lodbrok, do you know of any other motive but that of lust for plunder, which would probably lead to the perpetration tion of the dreadful crime with which the prisoner is accused?" asked the baron. 
               The usually stolid expression of Erik's visage changed to a fierceness almost demoniacal, as he replied, 
               "Herr Baron, I have heard that the Herr Henry came between Rolf Frode and his betrothed, Louise Sigvald." 
               A piercing shriek from the witness bench temporarily interrupted the proceedings of the court. All eyes were strained in the direction whence the cry proceeded, and it was seen that one of the young women there seated had fainted. It was Louise who now lay in a state of unconsciousness, her head, resting upon Hilda's shoulder. One or two ladies came to her assistance with restoratives, and an officer of the court brought a glass of water. In a short time she was restored to consciousness, and the business of the court was resumed. 
               "Is that young woman a witness in this case?" asked the baron. 
               He was informed that such was the case. 
               "May it please you, Herr Baron," said the district counselor, "she is the Louise Sigvald of whom the witness now on the stand was speaking." 
               "She had better retire into another room," said the baron. "She can be sent for when her testimony is wanted. Some of her friends can accompany her." 
               "No-no-pray let me remain, I must hear all that is said. Indeed I will not disturb the court again," said the poor girl, beseechingly, and she was permitted to remain. 
               When it was known that Louise was the betrothed of the prisoner at the bar, a murmur of compassion passed through the court-room, and the gaze of every person present was directed upon the prisoner, as if to see how he had comported himself during these trying moments, when Louise had openly betrayed so much sympathy in his behalf. 
               The flush of sudden passion had reddened his cheeks and brow and fired his eyes when he heard the vile innuendo uttered by Erik. He clenched his fist and bit his lips, and would have given utterance to the wrath within him, had he not been restrained, when about to speak, by the constable who stood near him; but the flush of anger gave way to the pallor of anxiety when he heard the shriek uttered by his betrothed, and the most intense and suffering anxiety was visible in his features, while she lay senseless in the arms of Hilda; and when Louise entreated permission to remain in the court-room, refusing the kindly intended proposition of the judge that she should retire to another room, he thanked her with a look and a smile of tenderness which she blushingly acknowledged. The softening look still lingered upon his countenance when he became, as we have said, for a moment, the special object of interest, and it was interpreted in his favor by the spectators. Again, at least among the more tender-hearted portion of the occupants of the crowded court-room, the balance of sympathy was in his favor. 
               "You have heard, Erik Lodbrok, that some jealousy was engendered in the breast of Rolf Frode, the prisoner at the bar, in consequence of the attention paid by the Herr Harcourt to Louise Sigvald?" said the baron. "The court does not want to know what you have heard. State what you know, and nothing more." 
               For a moment the witness was abashed. He glanced furtively toward Rolf, and then at Louise, and his face crimsoned. 
               The baron observed these symptoms of disquietude, and somewhat sternly he repeated the question which had led to the temporary interruption of the proceedings. 
               By a strong effort Erik regained his composure and replied boldly, "I know such to have been the case, Herr Baron." 
               "By what means did you become acquainted with this fact? It is not usual for persons to make confidants in such cases." 
               "I have heard it from the prisoner himself," said Erik. 
               "It is false, false as h-I!" exclaimed Rolf, unable to restrain himself. 
                
               "Silence!" thundered the crier. 
               "Keep silence, prisoner," said the baron, more mildly; "the witness must not be interrupted. You will have an opportunity afforded you of disproving his evidence, if you can do so." 
               "Where was this statement made?" asked the district counselor. 
               "On the island of Sartaroe," answered Erik. 
               "At what period?" 
               "A few days after Herr Henry was saved from the wreck, Herr Counselor." 
               "What was the language made use of by the prisoner?" 
               "Rolf Frode said in the cottage of Olaf Petersen, that Louise appeared to take great pleasure in the society of the young Englishman." 
               "Was that all that was said?" 
               "There was much more said to the same purport," was the reply. 
               "Was Olaf Petersen present at the time?" 
               "No, Herr Counselor; but his son Hans was." 
               "This is irrelevant," interposed the baron. "It amounts to nothing. Is Hans Petersen subpnaed as a witness?" 
               "He is, Herr Baron," replied the district counselor. 
               "Then let him be called to the stand to corroborate this testimony." 
               "I think, Herr Baron," said the counselor, "that you will acknowledge that it amounts to more than you now imagine. I have yet another question to put to the witness: 
               "Erik Lodbrok, I wish you to state whether, then or at any other time, you heard any threats of violence uttered by the prisoner?" 
               "He said to me, in the presence of Hans Petersen, that it would have been well if Herr Henry had been left to perish after the shipwreck." 
               "That is scarcely tantamount to a threat," remarked the baron. "Have you any more questions to put to the witness, Herr Counselor?" 
               "Not at present, Herr Baron." 
               "Then let the next witness be called." 
               Hans Petersen was called and took his place in the witnessbox. 
               "Do you recollect the conversation said to have taken place between the prisoner and the last witness, in your father's house, Hans Petersen?" said the baron, who, as is the custom in the Norwegian courts, not only cross-questioned the witnesses on both sides but, in the absence of counsel for the prisoner, in some measure took that office upon himself. All judges in Norway being answerable in damages for their decisions if they are reversed in the Hoieste Ret, or court of final resort, at Christiana, are naturally cautious in rendering judgment, and therefore assume the right of cross-questioning. 
               "I heard the words made use of," replied Hans. 
               "Were they spoken in a threatening manner?" 
               "No, Herr Baron, or if they were they were responded to by Erik and myself. We did not like to see Louise so much taken up with the gay, young English Herr." 
               A smile passed over the countenances alike of the judges and spectators at the honest confession of Hans. 
               "Have you any questions to put to this witness, Herr Counselor?" said the baron. 
               "None, Herr Baron. He has replied to that which I was about to put to him. He can retire." 
               "Let him remain. I have a few questions to put to him. Did you, Hans, at any subsequent period, hear conversation of a similar import?" 
               "We several times conversed upon the same topic," was the reply. 
               "Was any thing serious intended by it?" 
               "No, Herr Baron. Rolf or myself would have readily risked our lives a second time to rescue Herr Henry, had he been placed in peril similar to that from which we had once rescued him." 
               "You say Rolf and yourself; would not Erik Lodbrok have done the same thing?" 
               "I can not say what Erik would have done under such circumstances," replied Hans. 
               "Your witness, Herr Graaffen, does not seem to strengthen the case for the prosecution," said the baron. 
               "Hans," he continued, "it has been stated that Herr Harcourt presented money to Rolf Frode for the purchase of a boat, in fulfillment of a promise made to Louise Sigvald. In what manner was the gift received by the prisoner?" 
               "He was glad to get the money; because he wanted a boat, Herr Baron," was the reply. 
               "No doubt of that; but did he receive it as a gratuitous gift-a proof of Herr Harcourt's generosity-or as a salve for his wounded honor." 
               "I don't exactly comprehend your meaning, Herr Baron," was the reply of the witness; "but Christian Jansen refused to give his consent to the marriage of Rolf and Louise until Rolf had a boat of his own." 
               "I thought that every industrious fisherman owned his boat?" said the judge. 
               "Yes, Herr Baron." 
               "Then how came it that Rolf did not possess one?" 
               "He lost it at sea more than a year ago, while endeavoring to save the lives of two fishermen whose boat was stranded on the skerries, and it takes a long time for a poor fisherman to earn another boat." 
               "No doubt; that point is settled most creditably in favor of the prisoner; but, when Rolf received this gift, the betrothal took place?" 
               "It took place before that time, Herr Baron. Louise told me so herself." 
                
               "Indeed! Are you a relative of hers, that she made a confidant of you?" 
               "No, Herr Baron. I asked her to betroth herself to me, and she told me that she had promised to marry Rolf Frode; but that she would always esteem me as a brother." 
               Again a smile pervaded the countenance of every one in court. 
               "Did you anticipate this refusal?" said the judge, good-humoredly. 
               "No, Herr Baron; least of all in favor of Rolf. I told her that I thought she loved Erik Lodbrok, and she replied that she detested him, though he frequently visited her grandfather's cabin." 
               Many of the spectators laughed aloud at this sally, and at the discomfiture of Erik, whose evidence had not impressed them in his favor; but order was promptly restored, and the baron proceeded with his examination. 
               "The point at which I wish to arrive, is the manner in which this gift of Herr Harcourt's was received by Rolf Frode. Were any remarks made in your presence respecting it? or did you make any yourself?" 
               "It was often talked of on the island, Herr Baron. It was thought to be a very generous action on the part of Herr Henry; but Erik Lodbrok jeered him about it." 
               "Oh, Erik Lodbrok jeered him? Did he take those jeers quietly, or did he seem to feel them, and to be in a bad humor when he heard them?" 
               "He seemed to heed them very little, Herr Baron. He had been dull and low-spirited for some time, in consequence of his marriage being put off." 
               "His marriage put off? How was that?" 
               "I can not say. Rolf told me he did not know why himself, exactly." 
               "Did Christian Jansen refuse his consent?" 
               "No, Herr Baron; I was told that such was not the case." 
                
               "Had Herr Harcourt anything to do with its postponement?" 
               "Rolf told me that such was not the case," replied Hans. 
               "It was through Carl Jansen, the uncle of Louise. No one but Carl knew the reason, as I was told." 
               "You can stand down, Hans Petersen," said the judge. 
               "You have given your evidence very honestly, at all events. Have you any other witnesses to call, Herr Counselor?" 
               "None for the prosecution, Herr Baron," replied the district counselor. "If it please your lordship, the witnesses for the prisoner are present, and are ready to testify in his behalf." 
               "Who are they, Herr Counselor?" 
               "Hilda Welden, the sister of the prisoner, my lord; Louise Sigvald; Christian and Margaret Jansen, and the Rev. Mr. Bredell, the pastor of Tunes." 
               Louisa Sigvald was the first witness called on behalf of the prisoner. Her innocent and youthful appearance, and the painful position in which she was placed, led the court and spectators to sympathize deeply with her. It was hoped by all present that she would be able to testify to something which would benefit her lover; but she could only speak of his generous and noble disposition, and assert her perfect confidence in his innocence of the crime imputed to him. Rolf was kind to every living thing, she said, and would not injure a worm. She was bathed in tears, and sobbed audibly as she testified to Rolf's good character; and many of the female spectators wept in sympathy. She was asked by the judge whether she knew the cause of the impediment to her marriage; but she was unable to explain further, than that her uncle Carl had made her and Rolf promise not to marry for a twelvemonth, in consequence of something he had heard when on his last voyage to Christiana, and she denied that any jealousy had ever existed between her and her lover. 
               The testimony of Hilda was to the same purport as was also that of Christian and Margaret Jansen. The old light-house keeper asserted that he was quite willing that Rolf should marry his grand-daughter and take up his abode with him at Kongshun. His cottage was big enough for all the family, and all the children Rolf and Louise might have, and he was as much surprised as any one could be, to learn-when, as he thought, all impediments were at an end since Rolf had got a boat of his own-that the wedding-day was postponed. He declared that until that day while seated in the court-house listening to the evidence, he had been ignorant of the fact that his nephew, Carl, had interfered in the matter, and expressed his determination if Rolf were acquitted-as he had no doubt he would be-to go to Sartaroe, and make Carl tell him the cause of his interference. 
               Old Margaret Jansen could only sob aloud in the witness-box, and declare almost inaudibly that she loved Rolf as well as if he were her own son. 
               Hilda, in the course of her testimony, made allusions to the ill-will felt, and not seldom expressed, by Erik Lodbrok, toward her brother; but she was restrained by the district counselor, who said that this had nothing to do with the matter in question. 
               The pastor of Tunes, who had volunteered to attend, testified to the good characters both of Rolf and Louise. He had known them both when children, and had always been attached to them. 
               Unfortunately all this testimony in favor of the prisoner's character and disposition was little calculated to aid him in the present instance, except that it might lead to a mitigation of punishment when the sentence was pronounced by the court, should he be found guilty. 
               The witnesses resumed their seats, and the district counselor rose to address the jury. 
               He said that he was sorry that it had devolved upon him to conduct the present prosecution. No one in the court, not the noble judges and the honorable assessors on the bench, nor even the sister or the betrothed of the prisoner, would rejoice more than he, if any thing had been given in evidence, calculated to lighten the guilt of the prisoner; but he regretted to be compelled to point out to the jury that there was nothing whatever adduced in court in extenuation of the dreadful crime of which, in his opinion, and doubtless in the opinion of all who had heard the evidence, the prisoner was guilty, "He tells a plausible story, gentlemen of the Jury," he continued, "plausible to outward seeming before the testimony of his accusers is heard; but, when the matter is duly weighed, a most improbable one. The rifled pocket-book and the discharged pistol lying on the table" (here the counselor pointed to these articles), "afford proof positive of the prisoner's guilt. Had the pocket-book been found in the prisoner's possession at the time of his arrest, with the money untouched, and had he retained possession of the pistol which, according to the prisoner's statement, discharged itself in such a singular manner! there might have been some doubts whether the story he told were true or false. But the marks of a violent struggle upon the turf; the bloodstained grass and herbage; the proofs of this struggle having become more deadly as the participants approached the verge of the slope; the imprint of a human body seemingly dragged along the green sward to the edge of the cliff, as if with the purpose of casting it over into the dark, deep waters of the lake which lay beneath; the discovery of the victim's coat suspended on an outstretched branch midway between the edge of the precipice and the water. What does all this prove? That the avenging justice of Providence always baffles the most deeply-laid schemes of human depravity, and points a way to lead to the detection of the guilty. 
               "The fact of the prisoner's return to the hamlet immediately after the perpetration of the bloody deed, so far from affording any proof of his innocence, but increases the probability of his guilt. 
                
               "He, doubtless, wished to reach the hamlet in advance of Herr Staynor and Erik Lodbrok, because in so doing an opportunity was afforded him of telling his own story-giving his own version of the tragedy, and impressing the minds of his friends and the villagers in his favor; and as to the condition in which he reached the hamlet-the fact of his having fainted, and his subsequent illness, whether the latter was real or feigned-allow it to have been real-what is more natural than that he should experience the terrors of remorse after the deed was done? These feelings of remorse, acting upon an enfeebled frame-for the assassin had not escaped scatheless from the deadly struggle-produced faintness, and subsequent fever and delirium. 
               "That the prisoner is said to have heretofore borne a good character; that his natural disposition is said to be kind and gentle, affords not a particle of evidence to show that he is incapable of committing the crime imputed to him. The most gentle natures are the most terrible and implacable when roused to anger, and eager for revenge. That the prisoner intended to rob his victim, in the first instance, I will not take upon myself to say. It may be so, or it may not: but the existence of another motive likely to lead to the perpetration of the crime-the hatred, the deadly hatred inspired by jealousy-if it had not been fully proved, had been imputed to him, and not without a show of reason. It is not for me to explain to the jury my own theory of this foul murder. 
               "You, gentlemen, have heard the evidence, and will form your own conclusions therefrom as to the innocence or guilt of the prisoner. Still, I readily surmise what those conclusions will be. However painful it may be to you, gentlemen, I feel assured that a due regard for the sanctity of your oaths; a sense of the duty you owe to your God, to the laws of your country, and to that society of which you are all honorable members-will lead you, after due deliberation, and proper consideration of the evidence adduced, and the facts proven, to a conviction-however painful that conviction may be-of the guilt of the accused; and that, conscious as you must be that the security of society demands that Justice shall not imprudently and injudiciously yield to Mercy, you will bring in your verdict against the prisoner." 
               The district counselor resumed his seat, and for a few moments a solemn silence pervaded the court-room. 
               Then the baron asked the prisoner whether he had any thing further to say in proof of his self-asserted innocence, or in extenuation of his crime? 
               "Nothing, my Lord Baron," said Rolf. "I have proclaimed my perfect innocence. I have told the truth. I leave the rest with God. I can do no more." 
               The baron then briefly addressed the jury. He said that it rested with them to declare whether a murder had been committed, or whether the traveler had lost his life by accident, as was asserted by the prisoner. It was their duty to weigh the presumptive evidence of the prisoner's guilt with the statement made by the accused in his own defense, and to judge between these conflicting statements; and having judged to the best of their ability, to bring in their verdict according to the conclusion to which they might arrive. 
               If they thought there was any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the prisoner, he need scarcely inform them that it was their duty to give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt, and to lean to the side of mercy. 
               With the former good character and disposition of the accused, they had nothing to do. It was not to be taken into consideration by them. But as this testimony in favor of the prisoner's character had been given by several persons, who had known him from childhood-among others, by his (the baron's) revered and esteemed friend, the pastor of Tunes-it would be taken into consideration when sentence came to be pronounced-supposing that a verdict were found against the prisoner. If, on the contrary, they should, after due consideration, come to a conclusion favorable to the accused, he (the judge) would rejoice at it, inasmuch as not only would a painful duty be spared him, but a vast amount of domestic misery would be spared the prisoner's friends. With these remarks, he dismissed them to their consultation, bidding them remember that they had a duty to perform to God, and to the laws of their country, as well as to the unhappy prisoner at the bar. 
               The jury retired to the room appropriated to them, and the judges entered into conversation together respecting the case which had just been tried. The low buzz of whispered conversation resounded in a continuous hum throughout the courtroom. The general impression was, that the prisoner would be found guilty of murder, and the subject of whispered conversation was the penalty which would be attached to his crime. Some of the sterner spectators regretted that the death-penalty had been abolished. A crime such as that committed by the prisoner, apart from its great atrocity, would strike a deathblow to one of the most profitable sources of revenue to the city, if it were not visited by the severest punishment, and future travelers thus assured of the protection of the State. Others considered that servitude for life in chains was a worse punishment than death, and was indeed but death by slow torture, for the harsh treatment meted out to those found guilty of murder, hurried the strongest and most enduring criminal to his grave in two years. Yet others, of less stern mold, hoped and thought that a less severe punishment would be awarded; that there were at least doubts of the guilt of the accused, and that a few years' imprisonment would satisfy the demands of justice; and others still, whose sympathies had been excited in favor of the prisoner, hoped for his sake, as well as for the sake of his sister and his betrothed, that he would be acquitted. 
               Meanwhile, amid the painful anxiety which oppressed the very atmosphere of the court-room, and caused the spectators to catch their breath, as they listened to every sound from the direction of the jury-room, expecting that it was caused by the approaching return of the jurors, Louise and Hilda sat clasped in each other's arms, their heads bowed down in sorrow and dread. They spoke not a word, not a whisper was heard to pass between them; but those who stood near them observed that their lips moved as if in silent prayer. Christian and Margaret sat silent and motionless as statues, their eyes fixed upon the door through which the jury had quitted the court-room. Staynor stood with his arms folded across his breast, his eyes fixed upon, the judges. His countenance had a stern expression, as if he were conscious of having performed a painful duty, yet, as once or twice he directed his gaze toward the bench on which the young women were seated, his features relaxed, and pity was blended with the stern severity of his glance. Hans Petersen had taken a seat near Hilda and Louise, as if he were an ious to afford them protection should they need it; and Erik, where was he? Not to be seen. He had fallen back-as if to conceal himself from view-among the spectators in the body of the court. 
               Much interest was manifested in regard to the prisoner, by some of the spectators, who were curious to note how he would endure the painful ordeal of suspense to which he was subjected. He stood upright and firm, grasping with both hands the railing of the dock. His face was pale and his lips compressed, but not a muscle moved-not a nerve quivered. His eyes were fixed upon Louise and his sister with an expression of painful earnestness; but those who expected to see him tremble, or betray other signs of fear, were disappointed. Many a spectator in the court-room betrayed more anxiety than he during the weary half hour that elapsed between the departure and the return of the jury. 
               At length the sound of their approaching footsteps was heard. Their tread was slow and measured, as that of men who had made up their minds to the performance of a painful duty. The sound struck a chill upon the hearts of even the most hopeful ere they had entered the court-room. Presently the door was flung open by the usher, and they entered, amid the most profound silence, their looks cast upon the floor, and slowly defiled into their seats in the jury-box. 
               The customary forms were gone through with, and then the baron asked the solemn question: 
               "Have you agreed on your verdict, gentlemen?" 
               The foreman of the jury, the Tolk, as he is termed in Norway, rose and replied, 
               "We have, my Lord Baron." 
               "What say you, guilty or not guilty?" 
               "Guilty, my Lord Baron," replied the Tolk, at the same time handing a sealed paper to the judge, who broke the seal and read therefrom, 
               "We find the prisoner, Rolf Frode, guilty of murder in the first degree." 
               The spectators hushed their breath in the awe inspired by the reading of this verdict, and amid the solemn silence which prevailed a loud piercing shriek of agony was heard. 
               The eyes of every one in the court-room were turned in the direction of the spot where the young women Hilda and Louise were seated; both had fainted. 
               A general murmur of compassion and sympathy was heard. The judge directed that the young women should be removed to a private room, and they were conducted out of the court-room by a couple of officers, accompanied by Hans Petersen and Christian and his wife. 
               The prisoner uttered not a word; but with pale face and compressed lips he followed the retreating party with his eyes, and when the door closed upon them, fixed his gaze upon the judges. 
               "What have you to say, Rolf Frode?" said the baron, when the quietude due to the solemn occasion-which had been partially interrupted by the removal of the witnesses-had been restored. "What have you to say wherefore sentence should not be passed upon you?" 
                
               "I have said that I am innocent, my Lord Baron," replied the prisoner. "I can say nothing more. God judge between me and my accusers. I am ready to hear the sentence." 
               "Rolf Frode," said the baron, "after an impartial trial you have been found guilty of a heinous crime, by the solemn verdict of a body of your own countrymen. I feel it my duty to say that I approve of the verdict rendered. It is true that the evidence against you is purely circumstantial; but it could not well have been otherwise. In the solitude of the mountains, where the awful crime was perpetrated, there was no chance passer-by to witness the deed. Whether purposely or not, it is not for me to say, but you had separated yourself from your companions and stood in solitude with your victim, the eye of God alone upon you. That Herr Harcourt has been foully dealt with there is no doubt-as little doubt that you are his murderer. The trial has been brief, for there was little evidence to give; but what little there has been is conclusive. You have produced no witnesses in your defense; it could not be expected that in such a case as this you had any to produce. The testimony that has been given in favor of your previous character can have little weight in mitigating your punishment. It has only rendered the solemn duty I am called upon to perform more painful to me. It is sad indeed to think how you, bearing so good a character as you have borne, could have permitted feelings of revenge for a fancied injury to lead you to the perpetration of a crime which will for ever blight your future prospects in this world. You have not only brought upon yourself the vengeance of the law you have outraged, but you have entailed misery upon your family and friends, and upon a young and innocent girl who dearly loved you. 
               "I will not harrow your feelings by dwelling upon this subject, or by speaking of the base ingratitude which adds to the enormity of your crime, for it was your unhappy victim who generously provided you with the means of consummating your marriage with the maiden to whom you were betrothed. You will have ample time in the solitude of the prison, in which your future life will be spent, to think of this, and I trust to repent of your misdeeds before repentance is of no avail. 
               "I feel it my painful duty to sentence you to the severest punishment the law allows. Rolf Frode, the sentence of this court is, that-" 
               At this moment the solemn proceedings were interrupted by a noise at the entrance of the court-room. The officers who guarded the door were heard in violent altercation with some one who demanded entrance, and whom they attempted in vain to force back. 
               In vain the crier of the court called for order, and rapped his heavy hammer on his table. The judge was compelled to stop in the midst of pronouncing sentence upon the prisoner until order could be restored. 
               Meanwhile the individual who had been the cause of this disturbance had succeeded in forcing his way into the courtroom, in spite of the resistance of the officers, and he was now seen pushing aside the spectators, and advancing frantically toward the judge's bench. 
               He was a man of some thirty-five or forty years of age, clad in the garb of a pilot or fisherman, of rough exterior and athletic frame. Panting for breath he gained the front of the bench, and, stretching forth his arm, thrust a rudely-folded slip of paper under the nose of the baron. 
               "Stand back, man," exclaimed the baron. "Officers, remove this man, and hold him to answer for this outrage upon the dignity of the court." 
               "Read this note, Herr Baron," said the man, shaking off the officers who had laid hold of him. "I conjure you, by all you hold dear on earth, or sacred in heaven, to read this note." 
               Struck by the man's earnestness, the baron took the paper from his hand, and cast his eyes over the contents. Suddenly he started; turned pale, and passed his hand over his brow; pressing his eyelids, as if seized with vertigo. 
               Every body in the court-room was struck with amazement-judges, jurors and spectators alike. Each looked first at the baron, and then at his neighbor, as if seeking some explanation of this strange occurrence. 
               In a few moments the baron, with a violent effort, regained his composure. 
               "Stand aside, friend," he said to the intruder, "I will see you when the court is closed. This shall be looked to. Officers, remove the prisoner. I have received notice of some forthcoming testimony, which justifies delay. Let the prisoner be conducted back to jail. I will postpone pronouncing sentence until the end of the session. The court stands adjourned until ten o'clock to-morrow." 
               The prisoner, who had stood with his face buried in his hands, and his head resting upon the railing of the dock, while the baron had been addressing him, and who had not raised his head during the period of interruption, was led away by the officers, and the spectators rushed out of the thronged building into the street, glad to breathe the pure, fresh air, after their long confinement in the heated court-room. 
               Here they gathered in groups, and occupied themselves in eagerly discussing the events of the trial, and commenting upon the verdict, and in puzzling themselves in vain to account for the sudden appearance of the rude intruder who had outraged the dignity of the court and forced himself upon the notice of the judge, and, for the abrupt and premature adjournment of the court. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XVIII. 
               THE DISCLOSURE. 
               THE Baron Von Welden, when he quitted his chteau in the country at the call of duty, to preside in the judgment-seat of the supreme court of Bergen, took up his abode in a house of his own in the Strand Gaden. It was a small and somewhat inconvenient mansion, not possessing the faintest claim to outward elegance, and sufficiently incommodious in its interior arrangements; nevertheless it was handsomely furnished, and of size sufficient to accommodate a bachelor, or a widower and his retinue; and the people of Bergen, as well as the pastor of Tunes, were undecided under which head to class the baron. 
               In one of the snuggest apartments of this house, the baron and the Reverend Mr. Bredell-the pastor of Tunes-were seated on the evening of the day of Rolf's trial and conviction. A couple of bottles of Johanisberger upon the table, together with a few dishes of nuts and fruit, told that the gentlemen had dined; that the cloth had been removed, and that they were now enjoying their dessert. However, they appeared to take little enjoyment over their wine. A couple of glasses were filled with the generous liquor, but it remained untasted, and the nuts, which each gentleman were cracking, seemed to find them employment for their fingers, rather than to serve as a zest to the wine; while in the kitchen, below stairs, the servants were wondering to see the untasted dishes, which had been removed from the table, and indulging in various unprofitable speculations as to the cause of this unwonted defection in their master's appetite; for both he and the pastor, who was his frequent quent guest at the chteau, were not accustomed to disregard the merits of a well-cooked dinner. 
               It was eight o'clock in the evening, but still as light as noonday, for it was the middle of August, when, in the latitude of Bergen, the midsummer day has scarcely any period of darkness. 
               The usually cheerful visage of the clergyman was grave and troubled; but the countenance of the baron, at all times serious, now wore an expression of perplexity in addition to an unusual thoughtfulness. Twice or thrice he seemed to be on the point of speaking, but he as often checked himself and raised his eyes to the face of his companion, as if desirous that he should first break a silence which had continued for several minutes, and was now growing irksome. 
               Presently the pastor, sighing heavily, raised his wine-glass to his lips, merely tasted the wine, and set it down again, saying as he did so, 
               "I do not know, Herr Baron, when I have been so grieved as I have been to-day. I have known Rolf Frode from boyhood upward, and I can not believe that he is guilty of the dreadful crime imputed to him." 
               "Nevertheless the evidence appeared to me to be conclusive," said the baron, speaking slowly, and listening, as he spoke, as if in expectation of hearing footsteps in the passage. He checked himself for a moment and listened more attentively, then looked at his watch, replaced it in his fob, and continued, "I liked the countenance of the youth, and mistrusted the testimony of the witness, Erik Lodbrok. I was in hopes that some testimony would be given which would overthrow the evidence which seems to fix the crime upon the young man, beyond a possibility of doubt. But there was nothing-nothing. The jury could not do otherwise than bring in a verdict of guilty." 
               "And the unfortunate youth is sentenced, ere he has attained to the fullness of manhood, to spend the remainder of his days in prison and in chains. Such I heard was the sentence, although I did not remain to hear it passed upon him. I could not endure the agony of poor Louise Sigvald, and I left the court-house while the jury were still in consultation." 
               "Not so, Herr Pastor," replied the baron. "That was the sentence I was about to pass, though, in consideration of the excellent character the young man had previously borne, I should have subsequently applied, in person, for a mitigation of the penalty. Still it must be a severe one." 
               "The sentence has not yet been pronounced?" said the pastor, in a tone of surprise. 
               "No. I have postponed it until the end of the session-probably a week hence. The young man has been remanded to the city prison-. Excuse me, Herr Pastor, I fancy I hear a knock at the street door. I am expecting a visitor this evening;" and the baron stepped to the parlor door, opened it, and for a few moments listened attentively. 
               It was a false alarm, and he closed the door, resumed his seat, and continued the conversation. 
               "I was about to pass sentence," he said, "for it is my usual custom to pass sentence immediately after the conviction of an offender, when I was interrupted by a man attired in the garb of a fisherman or pilot, who forced his way through the crowd to the front of the bench and placed this note in my hand. Something in the man's look and manner, as well as the strange tenor of the note, induced me to postpone the sentence I was on the point of pronouncing. Read the note, Herr Bredell," he continued, after a pause. "Tell me what you think of it? It may have been written by a comrade of the prisoner's for a purpose, and yet I can not understand it." 
               The pastor took the note from the hand of the baron. It contained the following lines, written in a scrawling handwriting, ill-spelt, and almost; illegible. 
               "If the Baron, Herr Von Graaf, would not blindly consign the child of his lost wife-who is still living-to lasting misery, he will hesitate before he passes the sentence now upon his lips." 
                
               The pastor handed back the note, with a puzzled look. 
               "I can not understand it," said the baron. "It intimates certainly that the child is alive; but the sentence is so constructed that it may imply that my wife is living also." 
               The pastor looked more puzzled than before. He evidently thought the baron was deranged. 
               "Your wife and child, Herr Baron?" he said. "I was not aware that you were ever married. Besides, this letter speaks of the Baron Von Graaf." 
               "Von Graaf was my name before I succeeded to the estates and title of my maternal uncle, the Baron Von Welden, Herr Bredell," he replied. "But stay; there is a knock at the door, in earnest. Pastor Bredell, I requested this man to call upon me this evening. I hear his voice in the hall. I must see him in private. Pray wait here until I return," and he hurried out of the room, leaving the pastor still doubtful of his sanity. 
               Herr Bredell swallowed the wine which stood at his elbow, refilled his glass and set it down upon the table, shook his head doubtfully, and turning himself in his chair so as to face the window, fell into a reverie, the subject of which was the trial he had heard during the day, and the unfortunate young people whom he remembered when they were happy, innocent children on the island of Sartaroe, and when he was the humble curate of a small parish on the coast opposite the island. In the course of a few minutes he had quite forgotten the baron and every thing else save the matter which occupied his thoughts. 
               The baron, when he left the dining-room, met a servant ascending the stairs. 
               "A man is in the hall who wishes to see you, Herr Baron," said the footman. "He says that you desired him to wait upon you at eight o'clock this evening." 
               "Show him into my study," said the baron; but passing the servant on the stairs, while he was still speaking, he confronted the stranger who had presented him with the paper in the court-house, a few hours earlier, and himself led the way into the apartment he had mentioned, the man following him. 
               As the reader will have already surmised, it was Carl Jansen, the successor of Christian in the wardenship of the light-house, who had thrust himself into the court-house at the moment when the baron was about to pass sentence upon Rolf, and who now had called in obedience to the baron's command; but he no longer presented the brusque appearance he had presented in the court-house. He had divested himself of his pilot garb, and now wore the holiday costume of a Norwegian fisherman. The excitement, which had urged him to run the risk of fine and imprisonment for contempt of court, had subsided now that prompt action was no longer necessary, since he had gained his end in delaying Rolf's sentence, and finding himself in the presence of a man of the baron's rank, and perhaps doubtful of the manner in which the information he had to give would be received, and over estimating, as men of humble condition are often apt to do, the power of those of loftier station, and fearing, should the baron listen to him with displeasure, that his displeasure would be visited, not upon himself alone, but upon those whom he sought to save, Carl Jansen betrayed a nervous tremor such as he had never before experienced. A stranger to fear, he had a hundred times dared the utmost fury of the tempest, alone, in a frail fishing-boat, without blenching, and, in his capacity of pilot, he had often worked a vessel off a lee shore, conscious that upon his courage and skill the safety of the vessel and the lives of the crew depended, with less sense of the responsibility that devolved upon him than he felt now. 
               The baron waited for some time for his strange visitor to speak; but finding that he remained silent, and noticing his abashed demeanor, he requested to know his name, thinking that, conversation once opened, he would overcome his nervous timidity. 
                
               'Carl Jansen, Herr Baron. I am the light-house keeper of Sartaroe, please you," was the reply to this question. 
               "Carl Jansen!" said the baron, musingly. "Carl Jansen! Your name was mentioned in the course of the trial, to-day. You are described as being the uncle of a young woman who was one of the witnesses to prove the good character of the prisoner?" 
               "Yes, Herr Baron: but I am not Louise Sigvald's uncle." 
               "You are not the young woman's uncle?" said the baron, interrogatively. 
               "No, Herr Baron." 
               "It was stated in the course of the evidence that you had interposed to prevent the marriage of the prisoner with the young woman to whom he was betrothed," said the baron, after a pause. 
               "I did so, Herr Baron," was Carl's reply. 
               "Were you in the court-room during the progress of the trial?" 
               "No, Herr Baron." 
               "Why were you not subpoenaed as a witness? Why did you not voluntarily appear? It appears to me that your testimony would have served to enlighten the court on a very important point. And what is the meaning of the sentence scrawled upon the note you thrust into my hand to-day?" said the baron, coming at length to the point, which he himself had felt some unaccountable diffidence in approaching. 
               Carl had by this time regained his self-control. 
               "Herr Baron," he said, "it was only this morning that I heard of the trial, and I immediately hurried from Sataroe to Bergen, to give my testimony if it were needed. I reached the court-house only in time to thrust that note into your hand, and to beg you to delay the passing of a sentence which, be it just or unjust, would, if pronounced by your lips, have brought lasting misery upon yourself, as well as upon your own children. I only had time to write the sentence in the court-room, and regardless of consequences, to insist upon your reading it. Herr Baron, Louise Sigvald is your own child, the daughter of the Baroness Von Graaf; and Rolf and Hilda are also your children-the son and daughter of Ulrica Von Welden." 
               The baron started from his seat. "Man," said he, "how did you become possessed of this knowledge? Beware what you say. If I find this to be a trick to deceive me for purposes of your own, you shall suffer dearly for your temerity. If what you assert be true, you shall be rewarded." 
               The baron paced rapidly to and fro for some minutes, and then resuming his seat, awaited Carl's reply. 
               "Herr Baron," said Carl, "if twenty years ago you bore the title of Baron Von Graaf of Memel, in Prussia, what I have told you is true, as there is a God in heaven." 
               "Twenty years-fifteen years ago I was the Baron Von Graaf," replied the baron. "I adopted the name and title of Von Welden on the death of my uncle, whose heir I was." 
               "In the month of July, twenty years ago," continued Carl, "you embarked at Havre de Grace for Memel, on board the ship Livonia, taking with you your wife and infant daughter?" 
               "I did," replied the baron, "but the vessel was lost off the southern coast of Norway, and my wife and child perished. I was discovered, lashed to a spar, by the crew of a fishing-boat, and was rescued by them in a state of insensibility, and carried into the port of Trommae, where I heard that of all the crew and passengers of the Livonia, only myself and two seamen were saved." 
               "You were misinformed, Herr Baron," said Carl; "besides the two seamen and yourself, the Baroness Von Graaf and your infant daughter were rescued from the wreck and carried on shore alive. The baroness died shortly after she reached the land; but the child lived. As I have said, that child is now known as Louise Sigvald." 
               The baron covered his face with his hands, and leaned his head upon the table, while Carl was speaking. His frame trembled violently. He raised his head when he no longer heard the sound of his visitor's voice, and looked earnestly into his face. 
               "Fisherman," he said, sternly, "how and why has this knowledge been kept from me so many years? But-no. It can not be. This is some trick," he continued, fiercely. "You are deceiving me. You have some purpose of your own to serve. But beware, man, beware! I am not a man to be trifled with. If it be true that my child still lives, how came you to make the discovery, and at this juncture, too? And how came the daughter of the Baron Von Welden to occupy the lowly position of a fisherman's ward?" 
               "But little more than two months have elapsed since I learned that Louise was not my niece, nor the grand-daughter of Christian Jansen," said Carl. "Only a fortnight since I discovered that the Baron Von Welden and the Baron Von Graaf were one." 
               "But how did you learn this?" said the baron, impatiently. "Prove to me, fisherman, that my daughter lives. Prove it to me, and demand what reward you please. My gratitude shall know no bounds." 
               "You must listen patiently to my story, Herr Baron," replied Carl, "or I shall be unable to give you the proofs you demand." 
               "Then speak; in God's name, speak, man, and I will listen as patiently as I can. I will strive not to interrupt you until you have finished your story." 
               "Early in May," commenced Carl, "I sailed in my pilot-boat from Sartaroe, bound to the Skager Rack, with the intention of cruising off the southern coast of Norway, in order to intercept such vessels from England as were bound to Christiansand and Christiania, and the adjacent ports, and offering my services as a pilot. About three weeks after I reached the cruising-ground I boarded an English brig, bound to Christiansund, and my proffered services were accepted. The weather was stormy and the wind foul, and finding it impossible, until a change of wind occurred, to beat up to Christiansand, I brought the brig to an anchor in Mandal bay. We lay there several days, and the captain of the brig being naturally anxious to proceed on his voyage, was very much annoyed at the delay. 
               "However, there was no help for it. To have put to sea would only have been to lose the ground we had gained after three days' struggling against wind and tide. 
               "One evening-the third evening of our stay off Mandal-I was walking the deck with the captain, and I expressed my opinion that the wind would soon chop round into a more favorable quarter. 
               "'I hope so, pilot, with all my heart,' said the captain. 'This is an unlucky spot to me. Five years ago I was wind-bound for three weeks in this very harbor, and twenty years ago, or thereabouts, when I was a youngster of twenty-five, I was shipwrecked on the coast, within ten miles of the place where we now lie at anchor.' 
               "My curiosity was awakened. Twenty years ago, Herr Baron, my cousin, Peder Sigvald, lost his life, while employed as pilot on board a ship which went ashore on that part of the coast. 
               "I asked the captain the name of the vessel and the name of the port from which she sailed. 
               "'She was called the Livonia, and was bound from Havre to Memel, touching at Christiansand,' was his reply. 
               "It was the same vessel on board of which my cousin had perished, and I was naturally led to make further inquiries. 
               "I learned from the captain that only one of the crew beside himself-a sailor before the mast, as he was himself at that period-was saved. 
               "'Were there passengers on board the vessel?' I asked. 
               "'Only three, if I recollect aright,' he replied; 'but it is so long since, I may be mistaken. But I know there was a German baron, who was a passenger for Nemel, and who had his wife and a little child, only a few weeks old, with him, for I and my shipmate, who was saved along with me, held the lady and the child above water, as we clung ourselves to a spar, till we were all picked up by the wreckers, and carried on shore together.' 
               "'Did the lady and the child live?' I asked, for I had heard when the Livinia was lost that only three persons, two seamen and a male passenger, were saved. 
               "'Both reached the shore alive,' he replied; 'but the lady, who was in feeble health, never spoke after she was taken from the water. She was insensible when she reached Mandal here, where they landed us, and she died that same night.' 
               "'And the child lived?' I asked. 
               "'Yes, the child lived, poor little thing,' said the captain, 'and found a mother at Mandal, who, singularly enough, also died while I was still in the town. The babe never, poor little soul, knew either her own mother or the mother who adopted her. I wonder if she be still living?' 
               "I scarcely know how it was, Herr Baron, but such things will happen sometimes; we can't tell why. I felt so much interest in the captain's story that I asked other questions, and among the rest, the name of the woman who adopted the child, and how she came to die so soon afterward. 
               "'Why, to stick to facts,' said the captain, 'she never was actually adopted by this woman, poor creature, whose husband was lost on board the Livonia. He was our pilot.' 
               "'Pilot on board the Livonia, captain?' said I. 'What was his name?' 
               "'I can't recollect, after all these years have passed away,' replied the captain. 'Indeed I don't know that I ever heard it. I only recollect that his wife, who was confined at the time, died from the effects of the shock, when she heard of the loss of her husband. She had given birth to a daughter who only lived a few hours. She became delirious, and raved about her husband, and when she came to her senses, and asked to see her babe, they put this little one that was saved from the wreck by her side and made her believe it was her own. Poor soul! she only lived a few days longer, and the little one was a second time motherless, as one may say.' 
               "I did not tell the captain what I thought, Herr Baron; but it came into my head at once that Louise Sigvald was the child of whom he had been speaking, and the more I thought of it the more I became satisfied that such was the fact, for Louise bears no resemblance either to Peder Sigvald or to his wife. 
               "'Was the father of the child saved?' I asked of the captain. 
               "'I can't say,' was his reply. 'Now I seem to recollect having heard a long time afterward-I fancy it was four or five years afterward-when I made a second voyage to Christian-sand, that he was; but I may be mistaken. Pilot,' he suddenly cried, 'I think the wind is chopping round to the south'ard.' 
               "I was right in my calculations that we were going to have a change of wind. It had come round three or four points while we were talking together. The conversation ceased; we turned the hands up; got the brig under weigh; and in less than an hour were heading for Christiansand, running before a staggering south-wester, under all the sail we could carry. The next morning we brought-to in the harbor, and I left the brig. 
               "My pilot-boat was brought in by the mate during the day, and the same evening I sailed from Christiansand. 
               "What I had heard from the captain made such an impression on my mind, that, at the risk of losing a little time, and perhaps a chance of pilotage, I determined to go back to Mandal, and landing there, to make such inquiries as would satisfy me as to the correctness of the captain's story. 
               "When I reached there, the first thing I did was to search out the old nurse who had attended my cousin, Louise Sigvald, during her last illness. 
               "As good luck would have it, she was still living, though blind with age, and very infirm. 
                
               "I easily found out the place where she lived, and calling there, introduced myself, and questioned her relative to Louise. The captain's story was correct in every particular. She told me that my cousin's child died a few hours after its birth; the death was registered in the register-book in the vestry of the parish church, and I went there subsequently and read the entry with my own eyes. She said, furthermore, that after the death of my cousin, she had taken the infant to her own home, and grew to be so fond of it that notwithstanding she subsequently heard that its father had been saved from the wreck, she never made it known to him that his child was living. The poor little thing, she said, had no mother, and she, having no children of her own, resolved to brink it up as her own child. 
               "This she did until the little girl, who had received the name of her supposed mother, Louise Sigvald, was about three years old, when she was claimed as his grandchild by Christian Jansen, who was about to take charge of the light-house at Sartaroe. 
               "The old nurse felt greatly inclined at this time to disclose to Christian Jansen the secret of Louise's birth, and would have done so had she not, only a few weeks before the claim was made, heard that the father of the child was a rich baron, and she was fearful that she had committed a great crime, which would be visited with severe punishment if it came to the knowledge of the baron, in passing off his daughter as the daughter of a poor pilot. The secret was known only to herself, for the sexton who had buried the dead infant of Louise was himself dead; and the only other person who had known any thing about the matter had removed to Drontheim. 
               "She added that a beautiful portrait was hung round the child's neck when it was brought to the cottage of Louise Sigvald. She supposed that it was the portrait of the infant's mother, and though it would have sold for a good deal of money, for it was set in a gold case, and she was often inclined to sell it, she had been always afraid to do so, for fear of some evil happening to her; and she had allowed the child to take it with her when she went to Sartaroe with her grandfather. 
               "Herr Baron, Louise still carries that portrait in her bosom; and we have often wondered how she became possessed of it." 
               During this recital, the baron sat with his arms folded across his breast, looking fixedly into the face of the narrator, and had not interrupted him by the utterance of a single word. Carl paused for a few moments, as if he expected the baron would ask some questions of him; but he merely waved his hand impatiently, and said, 
               "Go on, man, go on; if you have any thing more to say," and Carl thus continued his narrative: 
               "Herr Baron, I had no longer any belief that I had a right to claim Louise as my niece; but although I had learned that the parents of Louise were persons of wealth and station, I knew not yet the name of her father. 
               "I could not afford to remain any longer at Mandal, prosecuting researches which would, after all my pains, in all probability be of no avail. I sailed on another cruise in the Skager Rack, and in the Gulf of Christiania, and in the course of a fortnight had the good fortune to be employed to pilot a vessel into the port of Christiania, The strange facts I had heard respecting Louise still haunted my mind, and it struck me that if I could procure a newspaper of the date of the shipwreck of the Livonia, I might possibly learn what I so much desired to know; for I thought that if the father of Louise were still living, it was my duty, for her sake as well as for his, to restore to him his long-lost daughter. 
               "In the public library attached to the University of Christiania, I found a file of newspapers reaching back to the date I mentioned, and in one of these newspapers I read the account of the shipwreck of the Livonia. In this account it was stated that only two seamen and one passenger, the Baron Von Graaf, of Memel, Prussia, were saved from the wreck. 
                
               "I was so delighted on making this discovery that I believe I read the paragraph aloud, unaware that I was doing so. 
               "An old gentleman was seated beside me in the library, and my interest in the account of the shipwreck attracted his notice. 
               "'Many years have passed since that shipwreck occurred,' he said, addressing himself to me; 'yet I recollect the particulars perfectly well. The loss of the vessel was much talked about in Christiania. It was remembered so much the longer, because the Baron Von Graaf, the passenger who was saved, and who lost his wife and his infant child in the vessel, came to reside in this city, bringing with him a little boy and girl, of four and six years old, about a year afterward.' 
               "'The Baron Von Graaf then lives in this city?' I said, interrogatively. 
               "'Not now,' replied the old gentleman. 'Indeed he only resided here for a few months, until he sold a considerable estate in the vicinity of the city, which had been left him by a relative.' 
               "'Were you acquainted with him?' I asked. 
               "'I met him, and conversed with him several times during his residence here,' was the reply. 
               "'And the children; were they his own?' 
               "He said they were the children of a deceased friend; but it was generally believed that they were his own illegitimate offspring; though some persons, who professed to know the history of his family, averred that they were his own children by a former wife-his cousin, Ulrica Von Welden. 
               "'May I ask by what name they were known?' I said. 
               "'The older of the two, who was the girl, was called Hilda Welden,' was the old gentleman's reply; 'the younger, the boy, was named Rolf Welden.' 
               "The names of the children sounded familiarly to my ears, and I asked whether, when the baron left Christiania, he took the children with him? 
                
               "'No,' said the old gentleman; 'he left them at a public school in the city, and, I am sorry to say, left no means for their support beyond what would keep them for a few months. Several inquiries were made respecting him, and letters were written to Memel; but no reply was received. He had either forsaken the poor children, or was dead. It was generally believed that the latter was the case.' 
               "'And what, subsequently, became of the children?' I inquired. 
               "'They were left a burden on the city, but were eventually adopted by a poor but worthy fisherman and his wife, named Frode, who, shortly after they had adopted the children, removed to some place near Bergen.' 
               "The old gentleman rose from his seat and bade me good day, and I quitted the library, and returned on board my vessel. 
               "I had discovered the name of Louise's father; and had learned that which greatly surprised me-that Rolf Frode and Hilda Welden were in all probability the brother and sister of Louise Sigvald! 
               "While still at Christiania, I received a letter from the prefect of Bergen, informing me that it was the intention of the directors of the light-house on Sartaroe island to pension off my uncle, and to offer the vacant post of light-house keeper to me. It was an advantageous offer; as I could still employ my pilot-boat, under the command of my mate, while I attended to the light-house, and received the salary of the keeper. I therefore sailed from Christiania, and made the best of my way back to Sartaroe. 
               "When within a few miles of the island, I fell in with the fleet, bound out on the spring fishery. Rolf Frode was on board one of the vessels, and, recognizing my pilot-boat, he came on board to tell me that he was betrothed to my niece, Louise Sigvald, and hoped soon to marry her. He was in high spirits, and expressed a hope that his profits out of the cruise he was engaged in, added to his savings, would enable him to purchase a small fishing-boat of his own, when every impediment to his marriage would be removed. 
               "I was greatly concerned when I heard this. I told him that I had heard some news while at Christiania, which would, if I had been correctly informed, render it impossible for him to marry my niece. He urged me to tell him what it was, but I refused; I thought that what I feared might not be true: that he might not be the son of the Baron Von Graaf, after all; but I urged him to return with me to Sartaroe and see Louise, in my presence, saying that he could easily rejoin the fishing fleet in the course of a day or two. He complied with my request, and returned in my pilot-boat to the island. 
               "We had scarcely reached my uncle's cottage, after landing on the island, when we met Louise, returning from a stroll on the cliff with the young Englishman who is believed to have been murdered in the mountains. 
               "Louise was glad to see me, poor girl! and glad also to meet Rolf again, though she was surprised at his returning so soon from the cruise. She was in high spirits, occasioned, as she has since informed us, by the generous promise of Herr Henry, as the young Englishman was called by the residents of Sartaroe, to purchase a boat for her lover. 
               "That evening I conversed with Rolf and Louisa in private. I repeated what I had told Rolf, refusing to explain myself more fully; but I succeeded in obtaining from them a promise to postpone the day of their wedding for a year. By the expiration of that period I hoped to satisfy myself of the truth or falsehood of what I had heard from the old gentleman in the library at Christiania. 
               "Several weeks elapsed. I received my appointment from the directors of light-houses, and my uncle removed with Louise to Kongshun. The young Englishman generously kept his promise, and Rolf received money to purchase a handsome boat. I had during this period held some conversation with Hilda Welden respecting her recollections of her childhood. She is older than her brother, and I thought she might perhaps remember removing from Christiana to Sartaroe. I knew that Rolf's reputed father, Carl Frode, had resided on the island with his wife several years before their death occurred; and I knew that Hilda, when very young, had married a fisherman named Ulrick Sather, by whom she had three children; and I was aware that her husband perished at sea, and that Rolf, poor fellow! lost his own boat in endeavoring to rescue Sather and his comrade. 
               "Hilda informed me that she perfectly recollected living at Christiana, and had some indistinct recollections of calling some other person than Carl Frode, father. He, she had always suspected, was not her real father. She had always retained the name of Welden until her marriage, though her brother was known as Rolf Frode; and, after her husband's death, she had resumed-as is often the case among the widows of the poorer class in this country-her maiden name, Hilda Welden. 
               "I was still at a loss to devise some means whereby I could ascertain whether Baron Von Graaf was still living; but, about a fortnight since, I was conversing with old Olaf Petersen, who has been a great traveler in his day. He casually observed, while speaking of Hilda Welden, who is a great favorite of the old man's, that she was a namesake of the rich Baron Von Welden. 
               "'It would be fortunate for her if she should turn out to be a relative of his,' I said, jocosely. 
               "'Yes,' said the old man, laughing; 'but the Baron Von Welden has not always borne that name. He is not a Norwegian by birth, but a Prussian, and was formerly the Baron Von Graaf. He succeeded, a good many years ago, as I have been told, to large estates in Norway as well as in Prussia, and then assumed the name of his uncle, who left him this large property.' 
                
               "'The Baron Von Graaf,' said I. 'Are you sure of this, Olaf Petersen?' 
               "'Sure that the Baron Von Welden was once known as the Baron Von Graaf?' was the old man's reply, 'for I knew him when he bore that title, and lived in Christiania; but not so sure about the report of the cause of his changing his name; though I have no doubt that the report is correct.' 
               "Herr Baron, I was satisfied now that I had found the father of Louise in you; and, perhaps, also the father of Rolf and Hilda; but I hesitated still to make known the discovery I had made. If they were all your children, there was, of course, a bar to the marriage of Rolf and Louise; if Rolf and Hilda were the children of another person, as my informant in Christiania had intimated might be the case, I felt satisfied that the Baron Von Welden, while acknowledging his daughter and receiving her to his house and heart, would forbid her marriage with a poor fisherman. I plead guilty, Herr Baron, to an intention of great wrong. I resolved to wait until I could discover, by some means, whether you were, indeed, the father of Rolf and Hilda, and if I found that you were not, I resolved that Rolf should marry Louise before I betrayed the secret of her birth. If I found it otherwise, I could make matters no worse, and would certainly benefit Rolf and Hilda by disclosing at once all the facts of which I had become possessed. 
               "I knew that I should have to bide my time, and to proceed cautiously in this matter, and I had made no further progress in my purpose when, this morning, I heard the shocking news that Rolf Frode was to stand his trial before the Baron Judge Von Welden, for the alleged murder of Herr Henry Harcourt. 
               "I hastened to Bergen, and arrived in time to delay the sentence which you, Herr Baron, were about to pronounce. It is for you to say if I have done well or ill." 
               Carl Jansen ceased speaking, and awaited the reply of the baron, who still maintained his upright position, and still sat in silence, until Carl began to grow alarmed at the rigidity of his face and figure. 
               At length, evidently striving to control the feeling he was unable to conceal, he said, in a calm, severe tone although every nerve in his face quivered with suppressed emotion: 
               "You have done well, so far, Carl Jansen. I have yet to satisfy myself that Louise is indeed my long-lost daughter; but Rolf is no son of mine. You shall be recompensed for your trouble; but mention the discovery you have made to no one, if you wish to benefit Rolf Frode. Go, now, and leave me. I wish to be alone. To-morrow, at this hour, let me see you again. Good-night." 
               Carl quitted the presence of the baron, and leaving the house proceeded in search of lodgings for the night, for it was too late to hope to find Louise or Christian Jansen, or to visit Rolf in the city prison; and the baron, after sitting for an hour with his head resting on his hands upon the table, rose from his seat, pale and languid, but with a fixed determination in the expression of his features, and rejoined the pastor of Tunes in the dinning-room, which he had quitted two hours before. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIX. 
               SELF-ACCUSATION. 
               WHEN the baron returned to the dining-room, he found the Reverend Mr. Bredell seated in the same position into which he had composed himself when his host quitted the apartment. 
               Probably he had been sleeping, for he was earnest in his attempts to excuse himself from any suspicion of somnolency without any such charge having been implied. 
               It was past ten o'clock, and the night watchmen had entered upon their duties, and one of these worthies chaunted forth, just beneath the window, one of those melancholy couplets which may be heard at stated periods during the hours of darkness in all the cities of Norway and Sweden, such as: 
                      
                        "Unless the Lord the city keep, 
                        The watchmen wake in vain." 
                     
                  
                
               "Very true, Herr Baron, very true," said the pastor. "As you say, 'Unless-' But, God bless me! what am I thinking of? I declare, baron, I thought it was you who spoke, and of a verity, it was the song of the watchman in the street below which greeted mine ears. Yet was I not asleep, Herr Baron! Oh no; my soul is too heavy to allow me to indulge in slumber, even if such indulgence were not rude and unseemly in the presence of my noble host. Truly, I am sorry that I permitted myself to become so much absorbed in thought as to forget--and yet, now I think of it, Herr Baron, you had left the room, and the inadvertence is not so unseemly as it would otherwise have been." 
                
               The good pastor, busily occupied in rubbing his eyes with his handkerchief, and in arranging his wig and neckerchief, both of which had fallen into disorder, during what he was pleased to term his reverie, had not looked into the face of his host while thus speaking; but at length when, having wheeled his chair round, he saw the pale and troubled visage of his patron, he exclaimed, 
               "Herr Baron; my dear Herr Baron, surely, I trust you are not ill? Ah! I recollect; you departed hence to meet a stranger-it must have been shortly after we had dined. Truly, I doubt whether I have not been sleeping. You gave into my hand a strange scrawl, too, for me to read. I almost forget its purport, yet I hope that the interview with the stranger has not been productive of inauspicious intelligence. If I remember aright, he professed to be enabled to give some information relating to poor Rolf Frode?" 
               The baron made no immediate reply to this disconnected speech of the pastor's; but helping himself to a glass of wine, he drank it off at a draught, refilled, and again emptied the glass. Then seating himself opposite his guest, he said, 
               "Herr Pastor, I have indeed heard strange intelligence; intelligence which has overwhelmed me with surprise, and which it should rejoice me to hear. Yet, if it be true, a painful duty devolves upon me, which will embitter my future life. You, Herr Bredell, have been for years my most esteemed friend and confidant, and yet I have withheld much from you, which, if disclosed, might have contributed to my peace of mind. You have never known that I am a widower. I, until to-day, believed that I was alone in the world, without a tie of blood to bind me to earth. The stranger whom I have just dismissed, one Carl Jansen, has informed me that my daughter is still living, and that Louise Sigvald is the name by which my long-lost child is known." 
               The clergyman sprang from his seat, in astonishment. 
               "A widower! Alone in the world! Daughter! Louise Sigvald!" he interjected, pausing between each exclamation, and still looking into the face of his patron, with an expression of mingled pity and alarm, as if doubtful of his sanity. 
               "Yes, Herr Bredell," continued the baron, smiling faintly, as if he understood the expression of his guest's visage; "this is no freak of the imagination. Strange as it may seem, this rude pilot, or fisherman, Carl Jansen, has afforded me almost positive proof of the existence of my daughter-my only child-in the person of the young woman whose appearance created so much interest and sympathy in the court-house this morning." 
               "Marvelous are the ways of Providence!" exclaimed the pastor, piously raising his eyes upward; "but, Herr Baron, I can not understand this-Louise Sigvald has always been believed to be the grand-daughter of old Christian and Margaret Jansen; the niece of Carl, and the child of Louise Jansen, who married a pilot named Sigvald. Truly this passes my comprehension." 
               "Can it be possible," exclaimed the baron, "that this is a vile attempt to deceive me? The man told a plausible story. Herr Bredell, you have been acquainted with Louise from childhood. This man spoke of a miniature which she wears round her neck. Have you ever seen a miniature upon her person?" 
               "I recollect having done so," replied the clergyman. "Once, several years ago, I took the child on my knee, on the occasion of one of my visits to old Jansen at Sartaroe, and playfully drew from her bosom a ribbon, to which a small gold locket was attached. The locket contained the portrait of a young and beautiful female, but it bore no resemblance to Louise. I recollect asking at the time who it represented; for I was surprised to see a trinket of such value in the possession of the child. Margaret Jansen told me that it had been placed round the little girl's neck, as she supposed, by her nurse. She did not know whose portrait it was." 
               "God of heaven!" exclaimed the baron. "Can it be that Thou hast thus, at this late period of my life, restored to me my child? Such a miniature as that described I had taken, in Paris, twenty years ago, or more, and I had it inclosed in a gold locket, which I presented to my poor, lost Mary!" 
               The pastor, who had hitherto believed the baron to be a bachelor, sat overwhelmed with amazement. The earnestness of the baron forbade him any longer to doubt his sanity, and yet he could not comprehend what he heard. 
               The baron sat for some minutes in silence, and absorbed in thought; then raising his head, he said, 
               "Herr Bredell, often as we have conversed together, and great as has been the confidence I have reposed in you, I have never, hitherto, related to you the history of my early life. The loss of my wife, and, as I have hitherto believed, of my infant daughter, cast a gloom over me which has clouded my happiness, and has embittered the prosperity with which Providence has since blessed me. It has been a theme of sacred sorrow, which I have never cared to make known to others, although few days have passed during which I have not spent some portion of the day in contemplation of the portrait of my wife, which hangs in the picture gallery at the chteau. You recollect having observed the portrait to which I allude; it hangs near the entrance, by the bow window?" 
               The pastor bowed. 
               "Then listen with patience to what I am about to relate. If my child is indeed about to be restored to me, I shall need your advice, not in regard to her alone, but in relation likewise to other matters. 
               "Twenty-one years ago, when I was a young man of twenty-eight, I met in Paris a young English girl, the daughter of a gentleman named Harcourt. 
               "Poor, dear Mary! she was one of the prettiest, as well as one of the gayest belles then in the French capital. 
               "I, at that period, bore the name of Von Graaf. I am the son of the Baron Von Graaf, a Prussian nobleman, who, notwithstanding his aristocratic descent, had, before I was born, become greatly impoverished. I enjoyed an income from my father of only a few thousand francs per annum, little enough to support myself in the society in which I mixed in Paris. 
               "Mary Harcourt and I were thrown a great deal into each other's society; and I candidly acknowledge that my primary object in resolving to attempt to gain her affections, was to help my impoverished condition, by marrying the daughter of an English gentleman of wealth. This base project, however, was soon superseded by sentiments of the purest love on my part, and I had reason to know that my love was reciprocated. The young lady attempted no deceit. I asked her hand in marriage, and she accepted my offer, at the same time telling me, frankly, that she had no expectations from her father; that she had a brother living who would succeed to the family estate, which was strictly entailed, and that she had reason to believe that her father's circumstances were greatly embarrassed; that he was deeply in debt, and that even her brother's entail was almost swallowed up by mortgages upon the estate. Furthermore, that her father was a proud, austere man, who would not, she feared, give his consent to her union with an impoverished family, however lofty the rank of him who might solicit her hand. 
               "I confess that this information cooled my ardor in some degree. In fact I pretended that I was called away from Paris by urgent business, in the hope that absence would cool my passion. 
               "But I was mistaken. Every day of absence from the object of my affection, added intensity to my love. The thought of the utter, absence from suspicion with which Mary received the information of the pretended necessity of my return home, filled me with remorse, and, in a few weeks, I returned to the French capital; renewed my intimacy with the young lady; again urged a speedy marriage; and, regardless of consequences, we were married, a month afterward, at the Prussian embassy in Paris. 
               "Poor enough we both were; but Mary possessed a few hundred pounds in the hands of her banker, in Paris, which had been supplied her to pay her expenses in the capital, where she was staying with a distant relative, and my income was at least sufficient to preserve us from actual poverty. Besides, I had expectations from wealthy relations, which, a few years after my marriage, were abundantly realized. 
               "Mary wrote to her father, informing him of the step she had taken, and asking his forgiveness. I wrote also, and stated, in my letter, the full particulars relative to my present condition and my future prospects. 
               "Mary's letter was returned unopened. To mine the old gentleman replied by abusing me as the seducer of his child, and by taunting me with being a miserable swindler-a German baron! whose present condition was that of a pauper, and whose future expectations were all moonshine-so the letter was worded. The old gentleman concluded by saying that he utterly discarded his daughter, whom he no longer considered as his child. 
               "Poor Mary wept bitterly over this letter; but she soon dried her tears; said that she did not repent the step she had taken, and that she firmly trusted to time to bring about a reconciliation with her father. 
               "Several years afterward, I heard that when Mr. Harcourt died, he left by his will the sum of 500 per annum, to his daughter, with his forgiveness; but the money, neither she nor I then needed; and for her, the forgiveness came too late!" 
               Here the baron paused for some time, overcome by his feelings, and the pastor, by way of diverting his attention, observed, 
               "Did it never strike you, Herr Baron, that the name of the young Englishman who is believed to have lost his life on the Hardanger Fjeld, and that of your wife's father, are the same?" 
               "It has," resumed the baron. "The unfortunate young gentleman with his friend, Herr Staynor, were overtaken by a storm, while on their way to the Praeste-garde of Tunes, only three weeks since. The similarity of the name struck me then; but the same disinclination to revert to the subject of my marriage, which has kept my lips sealed for years, prevented me from then mentioning to my guest the similarity of his name and that of my much-loved, long-lost wife. It would be strange, indeed, if he should prove to have been connected with the family, and that through the unhappy fate which has befallen him I should recover my child; but there are many families of that name in England, I presume." 
               "Possibly so, Herr Baron," replied the pastor. 
               The baron resumed his narrative. 
               "Comparatively poor as we were, the twelvemonth which succeeded our marriage was the happiest period of my life. We occupied cheap lodgings in one of the faubourgs of Paris, and there resided happy in our mutual love, and hopeful of the day when Mr. Harcourt would become reconciled to our union. The knowledge of her father's anger was the only trouble my Mary had. We were too happy. Such felicity could not last! 
               In Paris our daughter was born within a twelvemonth of our marriage; and just at this time I received a letter from Memel, informing me of the death of a relative, who had bequeathed me the whole of his property. It was not large; but it was the first installment of the abundant wealth of which I eventually became possessed. This legacy necessitated my early return to Prussia; and, at the expiration of a month, my wife was sufficiently recovered from the effects of her confinement, to accompany me. The physicians recommended a voyage by sea, rather than travel by land, for the land-travel from France to Prussia was in those days tedious and wearisome, and we embarked at Havre de Grace, on board the ship Livonia, bound to Christiansand and Memel, the latter port being our own destination. 
               "Mary was in high spirits and full of hope that this sudden and unexpected change in our circumstances would hasten the reconciliation with her father, which she so ardently longed for. 
                
               "Our voyage at the commencement was favorable. On the fifth day after leaving Havre de Grace, we sighted the Lindesness light, and hoped to reach Christiansand on the following day; but that night a furious tempest arose. We had approached too near the land to beat the vessel into a safe offing. Compelled to carry a press of sail to avoid drifting on shore, the very means we used to secure our safety proved our ruin. We had taken a pilot on board off the Lindesness, but all his skill availed us naught. We lost our masts and sails; the ship became unmanageable, and we were cast on the rocks near the port of Mandal. 
               "I dare not dwell upon the horrors of that fearful night. Mary bore herself bravely. I had succeeded, at last, when all hope of saving the vessel had fled, in securing a position of partial protection from the rage of the tempest, beneath the high poop-deck of the ship, and was in the act of lashing my wife and child to a stancheon, when a wave broke on board the vessel, and I saw them swept from my side into the raging waters. In another moment I was struck senseless by a violent blow on the head from a spar which the sea had torn adrift, and I recollect nothing until I awoke to consciousness, and found myself, faint and bruised, lying on a wretched couch in the cabin of a poor fisherman of Trommoe. 
               "I was told that all on board the ship had perished but myself and two of the crew. I was almost distracted when I heard this fatal intelligence. I fainted away again, and, as I subsequently learned, lay for several days in a delirious fever. When I was sufficiently recovered to rise from my couch, I made every possible inquiry respecting the fate of my wife and child; but all was useless. It seemed certain that they had perished. 
               "As soon as possible I embarked for Memel from Christian sand, and only arrived in my native city in time to witness the death of my father. I was the only child of the Baron Von Graaf; but my father's death brought no addition to my income. He had impoverished himself; deprived himself of the comforts of life, to provide me with an education suitable to the rank of my family, and with the means of supporting myself in Paris. I did not know this until after the good old man's death. How deeply I grieved then to think that I had not known of this self-sacrifice on his part, and that I had been living a life of pleasure in the French capital, while he was living in poverty in the suburbs of Memel! I was overwhelmed with sorrow; but my father feebly endeavored to console me, and died while in the act of expressing his satisfaction at the bright prospects that were opening before me. Bright prospects! I had never informed him that I had wedded a dearly-loved but portionless wife, and he died unconscious of the sad bereavement I had sustained in the loss of my wife and child! 
               "The relative who had bequeathed me the legacy was the Baroness Ulrica Von Welden, my cousin, and the niece of the Baron Von Welden, whose title I now bear, and whose fortune I have inherited. Ulrica Von Welden was considerably older than I, but she had never married. Her fortune, though not large, was amply sufficient for her support even in comparative luxury, and the larger portion of her estates were located in the vicinity of Christiania in Norway, and inherited from her mother, who was of Norwegan descent, as was also the wife of the Baron Von Welden, her, and my uncle. Three years previous to Ulrica's death, she had adopted the orphan children of a Norwegian gentleman, toward whom it was said she had at one time entertained an affection. These children were left destitute on the death of their parents, both of whom died nearly at the same time. Their names were Rolf and Hilda Swensen. Nay, start not, Herr Pastor," continued the baron, after a pause, noticing the astonishment depicted upon the pastor's visage on hearing the Christian names of his young friends of Sartaroe mentioned. "Wait patiently, and hear what I have yet to tell. Learn that the Baron Von Welden-the supreme judge of the district of Bergen-he whom men revere for his upright conduct, and applaud for his benevolence and charity, is not the immaculate man he is thought to be by short-sighted mortals, who can only read and judge by outward seeming; learn that the Baron Von Welden years ago planted a thorn in his bosom, which has rankled and rankled ever since, despite his every effort to silence the rebukes of conscience by alms-giving and by watchful care over the tenantry committed to his charge; learn how that, which at first appeared a slight deviation only from the path of rectitude, has led to gross injustice, and to the ruin of a fellow-creature, and how, Herr Bredell, an avenging God has caused to devolve upon me the duty of sentencing to a living death the youth, who, had not I wronged him in his infancy, would not have been placed in a position to have incurred the dreadful penalty; for, it is pretense to assume a doubt-Rolf Frode and his sister Hilda are the children who were adopted by my cousin Ulrica, and I am the indirect cause of the murder of which the youth has been adjudged guilty; and-oh, heaven! the thought is dreadful. Pray God it may not be! Perchance the murdered Henry Harcourt is a relative of my poor Mary's." 
               The conscience-stricken tone in which the baron had given utterance to this declaration, frightened the good-hearted and simple-minded pastor, and he endeavored to calm the speaker by expressing his belief that he blamed himself without sufficient cause, and his hopes that matters would not turn out so sadly. "Perhaps, Herr Baron," he said, "the poor youth may not be guilty, and whatever evil hath been done may be rectified even now, at the eleventh hour." 
               "Nay, my good, worthy pastor," said the baron, in a gentler tone of voice, for the kindliness of the clergyman's manner had tended to soothe his excitement. "Nay, there is no hope. The youth has been found guilty, and it rests not with you or I to question the verdict of the jury who heard the evidence brought against him on his trial. Neither will I attempt to evade the solemn task imposed upon me by the Almighty Power whom I have offended, and who has thus seen fit to abase my pride and to punish my lust after wealth. 
               "I will pronounce the doom upon the unfortunate youth. I will restore twofold to his sister that out of which I wronged her and him, and thus will the evil I have done become known to the world; and Louise, my long-lost daughter, will be received to the arms of her father only to learn that that father has sat in judgment on her lover, and has doomed him to punishment for a crime which, had her father acted justly, years ago, would never have been perpetrated. 
               "Yet, think not," continued the baron, after a long pause; "think not that I intended a permanent wrong to these unfortunates. An endeavor temporarily to deceive, with the intention of reparing the wrong at a future period, has led to all this misery." 
               Again the baron proceeded with his narrative. 
               "My cousin Ulrica left me sole heir to her estates and to be all her movable property, only consigning to my tender care the orphan children whom she had adopted and who were known by her own surname-Welden. She urged me, in her will, to educate them thoroughly, and to see that they were well settled in life-as I loved her and reverenced her memory. 
               "The will was read aloud, in the presence of the temporary executors of her estate, and I was duly placed in possession of the estates and other property of the deceased. 
               "The children, Rolf and Hilda, were residing at my late cousin's chteau, under the charge of their nurse, and thither I removed. 
               "The examination of the papers my cousin had left behind her occupied me for several days. I had nearly accomplished the task, when I accidentally discovered an old, well-worn writing-desk, which the old nurse told me had been a favorite heirloom of my cousin's, and was the desk which she was accustomed to use when writing. 
                
               "I opened this desk, which had been disregarded by the executors, and found therein a sealed parchment, directed to myself, in my cousin's handwriting. 
               "I broke open the seal and discovered that it was a second will, duly attested, and dated only a few days previous to my cousin's death-she had died after a very brief illness-in which it was stated that having, since the former will was made, learned that it was the intention of my uncle, the Baron Von Welden, to make me the sole heir to his large property in Prussia and Norway, she had revoked the provisions of her former will, and had left to her adopted children, Rolf and Hilda Welden, ne Swensen, her estates near Christiania, in Norway, for their sole use and benefit; a sum was to be deducted from the interest of the property, until they severally became of age, sufficient to defray the expenses of their support and education, under my direction, in consideration of which task of guardianship, she bequeathed to me her smaller estate near Memel, in Prussia, as a mark of her regard, although the bequest promised by my uncle would render it of trifling value to me. 
               "I was still engaged in the perusal of this will, when a servant informed me that a gentleman wished to see me. I desired that he should be admitted, and a young man shortly afterward entered the room, whom I recognized as the assistant of the legal firm to whom my cousin had been in the habit of intrusting the direction of her affairs. 
               "'I perceive, Herr Baron,' said he 'that you have already discovered the existence of the document respecting which I called to speak with you.' 
               "'I have discovered a later will of my deceased cousin,' I replied, 'which I perceive alters very considerably the provisions of her former will. I perceive, also, that it is attested by you, Herr Balden.' 
               "'I alone was the witness to it,' was the young man's reply. 'The seniors of the firm were absent from home when the Baroness Von Welden sent for me to alter the provisions of her former will, which was in the possession of her own special legal adviser. She felt unwell and appeared then to fear that she was threatened with an illness from which she would not recover. None but you and myself, Herr Baron, are aware of the existence of the will you hold in your hand.' 
               "'Why was this fact not made known?' I asked. 
               "'It is for you, Herr Baron, to say whether it is not better that it should remain unknown. The property bequeathed to you is not one fourth of the value of the estates of the deceased baroness,' replied the young man, with a sinister smile. 
               "I was about to reply angrily, and to order the tempter to quit my sight, when my evil genius whispered in my ear: 'Will you become the laughing-stock of your friends, who will smile when they learn that instead of becoming a large landed proprietor, you have only become the paid guardian of, two infant children? What is to prevent you from retaining possession of all the property agreeable to the provisions of the former will until you actually become possessed of your uncle's estates? That day may be years hence: it may not arrive at all. Your uncle may change his mind. You can still do your duty by these children intrusted to your care, and eventually you can make over to them the property bequeathed to them by the baroness. You will thus be secure from the poverty which would result from any whim or caprice on the part of the Baron Von Welden, which may induce him to make some other person his heir.' 
               "To hesitate about the performance of a guilty action is already to commit it. The young man noticed my indecision, and took advantage of it. He urged me to consider the matter well, and to act accordingly. 
               "The subject is a painful one to recur to, Herr Pastor. Suffice it to say that I was tempted, and that I fell into the snare the evil one had laid to entrap me. The will was destroyed, and the young man, who wished to enter into business with his brother at Berlin, was supplied by me with money-by way of bribe-sufficient to enable him to gratify his desire. I had no fear of future betrayal on his part, for he was equally guilty with myself, and he did not know, since I had been base enough to acquiesce in his villainy, whether I would not deny, should he, at some future day, prefer a charge against me, that such a will had existed, in which case he would compromise his own character without injuring mine, and I also solemnly aver that I internally resolved that when I succeeded to my uncle's estates, Rolf and Hilda should receive the whole benefit of my cousin's legacy. In fact, on the day on which I became the Baron Von Welden, I made a will, bequeathing to them or to their heirs, at any future period, could they be discovered, the entire estate of my cousin Ulrica Von Welden. 
               "Shortly after this interview with the young lawyer, I visited Christiania, taking with me the two children, whom I intended to place at school in that city. I went to visit the estate, not to dispose of it, as Carl Jansen was informed-the change in my name has been the cause of the supposition that it was sold-it is now supposed to belong to the Baron Von Welden, then it was believed to be the property of the Baron Von Graaf. I placed the children at a public school in the city, and after residing for a few months at Christiania I returned to Prussia. 
               "While I had been absent, political troubles had broken out. I was still young, and ardent in what I considered the cause of liberty; besides, I was glad to enter into any excitement which would banish from my mind the painful recollections of the loss of my wife and child. 
               "I espoused the cause of the party which was disaffected toward the government. Our party was unsuccessful, and the ringleaders, among whom I was accounted one, were arrested. Some were condemned to death: but I escaped with the penalty of fifteen years' imprisonment in the castle of Berlin, and with the confiscation of my title and my property in Prussia. 
               "For five years I remained incarcerated in the state prison, of Berlin. At the expiration of that period, my uncle, the Baron Von Welden, died. The king of Prussia about this period also died, and was succeeded by his son. An act of amnesty had been granted, on the accession of the young monarch, to all political offenders, and I, among the rest, was liberated from prison, on condition of exiling myself from Prussia. I learned, on emerging from prison, that my uncle had, on condition of my taking his name, bequeathed to me the whole of his vast estates. 
               "It mattered little that I was obliged to quit Prussia, since nearly the whole of the landed property of the Baron Von Welden was situated in Norway, in the vicinity of Bergen, where I now reside. 
               "I revisited Christiania and found that the estate in its vicinity had been allowed to run to waste. I took possession of the property in the name of the Baron Von Welden, and then instituted inquiries regarding the children I had left at school in the city. 
               "No one knew what had become of them. I heard a dozen different reports; but it was generally conceded that they had been adopted by a poor fisherman, who had removed from Christiania, no one knew whither. 
               "All my inquiries, extending over the space of several months, were fruitless. I was informed that the principal of the school in whose care they had been left, had written to Memel, to the Baron Von Graaf, and had received no reply. I well knew the cause of this; but I did not think it necessary to enlighten the people of Christiania on this point. I called at the school; but the principal, I learned, had been dead two years, and the assistants had been removed. There was no one in the school who had known the children, though some had heard of the circumstances attending their removal from it. 
               "Finding all my exertions, to be of no avail, I removed to the estate upon which I now reside, and there, for more than ten years, I have lived, employing my time in endeavoring to ameliorate the condition of my tenants, and endeavoring to smother the remorse occasioned by the act of injustice I have related to you, by the performance of deeds of benevolence, and by exerting myself for the public welfare. I have gained a good name and have risen to a position of the highest honor; but mark, Herr Bredell, the retributive justice of the Almighty! The high position to which I have been exalted has led not only to the discovery of my guilt, but brought me to the painful position of sitting in judgment upon the youth whom I have wronged, and whom for years I have longed to discover and to claim as my adopted heir, for I believed myself childless, and I had vowed ever to be true to the memory of my beloved Mary, and to take no second wife to my heart and home. I have discovered my long-lost daughter. In so much God has tempered mercy with justice; but will she, can she rejoice to find such a father? 
               "Herr Bredell, for an hour this evening, after my rough, but honest, visitor had left the house, I sat buried in thought. I was tempted to disavow every thing; to permit the bitter cup to pass from me, and under the plea of ill health, to allow some other judge to pass sentence upon the prisoner, Rolf Frode; and when the sentence was passed to remove from this part of the country, or from this land, and to find some means of making known to my child her father's existence, and begging her to join me, without making known to her the manner in which I have assisted in bringing this misery upon her and those whom she best loves; but better thoughts prevailed. I resolved to drink the bitter draught to the dregs, at whatever cost, and to leave the rest to a merciful God. With this resolve I sought you out and have made you the confidant of the acts of my past life and of the misery that has been entailed, not upon me alone, but upon others, by one false step from the path of honor and integrity." 
               The baron ceased speaking, and bowed his head upon the table, evidently suffering under the most poignant anguish of mind. The good, simple-minded pastor was greatly distressed at the recital he had heard. 
               He scarcely knew what to say, and yet he strove, for a long time, in vain, to impart comfort to his generous and noble patron. At length he partially succeeded. The baron became more composed, and he and the pastor conversed upon the best method of making known to Louise the secret of her birth. 
               It was finally arranged that the pastor should seek out Carl Jansen early on the following morning, and that he should be instructed to bring Louise into his presence without previously disclosing any thing to her of his object in so doing; that the secret should be disclosed to her as gently as possible; and that she should be subsequently introduced to her father. Furthermore that neither Rolf nor Hilda should yet be informed of the discovery which had been made; and, although the baron, with Roman fortitude, still persisted in his resolve to pronounce himself the sentence against Rolf, in pursuance of what he deemed a duty which had devolved upon him in accordance with the retributive justice of the Almighty who had thus deemed it fitting to punish him for his sin, he resolved to use all the influence he possessed to obtain a mitigation of the sentence, if not a free pardon, from the crown-though, to tell the truth, neither he nor the pastor could conceive of any plea of extenuating circumstances, which could lead to the result they hoped for; but, whatever might be the result of their joint efforts, the baron determined to settle upon Hilda, immediately, the estate near Christiania, which had of late years nearly doubled its value; and furthermore, if a pardon could not be procured for her brother, to take such steps as would render his servitude more easy to bear. 
               The two gentlemen then retired to their bedrooms, for it was long past midnight before their conference ended; but neither slept till daylight, when, worn out with fatigue and anxiety, both sank into a fitful slumber. 
               Thus ended the day of Rolf Frode's trial at Bergen for the alleged murder of Henry Harcourt. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XX. 
               AN UNEXPECTED RE-APPEARANCE. 
               NOTWITHSTANDING the late hour at which the pastor of Tunes had retired to rest, he was early astir on the following morning, and, although he had refreshed his exhausted energies with scarcely a couple of hours of fitful slumber, he looked as lively and fresh as he was ever accustomed to look. Indeed, the unwonted excitement of the previous day had rather served to quicken than to dull his faculties. Used for many years to a life of unvaried sameness, and to a round of daily occupations, differing only in the increased labors which devolved upon him on the Sabbath, he entered heart and soul into the performance of the duty allotted to him at the close of the conversation of the previous evening, and with all the greater vigor in consequence of the hope he entertained of being eminently serviceable to those whom he had known for many years, and with whom, in their misfortunes, he sincerely sympathized. 
               With no little difficulty he managed to discover the house in which Carl Jansen had taken up his night's lodgings. Carl had already risen, and he respectfully saluted the clergyman when the latter entered the room in which he was seated, endeavoring to persuade himself that he was strengthening himself for the duties of the day, by partaking of a hearty breakfast, without which Carl would have considered it a physical impossibility for any man to commence his labors, although in feet the brave pilot had never in his life made such a wretched endeavor to swallow the food placed before him. 
               He recognized the pastor, having frequently seen him on the island of Sartaroe, and readily entered into conversation with him in relation to the events of the preceding day. 
               He expressed his firm opinion that Rolf was innocent of the crime of which he had been found guilty. He had known him from a boy, he said, and a finer lad, or a better and bolder fisherman never cast a line overboard. He expressed the utmost sympathy for poor Louise and Hilda, and adverted in terms of not the most respectful tenor, to the baron, who had, he thought, judged Rolf hastily, and whom he still believed to be the youth's father. 
               "What are we to expect, Herr Pastor," he said, "when we find men like the baron disowning their own flesh and blood, and seemingly only too eager to fasten crime upon those they are bound by the ties of nature to love and protect?" 
               The honest pilot would have proceeded to talk the whole matter over, had not the clergyman interrupted him, by informing him that the baron was not only anxious to acknowledge his daughter, but that he also deeply sympathized with the unfortunate Rolf. "And now, Carl," continued the pastor, "you must assist us in this difficult matter. I need not impress upon your mind the necessity of secrecy at present, since you must be aware so much depends upon it. To inform Louise abruptly of the secret of her birth might be productive of serious consequences, and, as things now stand, it would be equally hazardous to hint any thing relating to this discovery to Hilda or Rolf, or indeed to any one. I wish you now to proceed immediately and find out Louise, if you do not know already where she is staying, and then to bring her with you to the baron's residence, where you called last night. Tell her that Herr Bredell waits to see her, and she will accompany you willingly; but do not mention that I am staying at the house of the baron. I will prepare her, cautiously, for the unexpected and startling intelligence, and will then conduct her into the presence of her father." 
               "Does the Baron Von Welden intend to acknowledge the poor child?" said Carl. "He seemed to deny the truth of what I told him last night." 
               "He does," replied the pastor. 
               "So much the more to his credit," bluntly replied the pilot; "but," he added, "I doubt if Louise will be glad to find such a father." 
               "'Judge not, that ye be not judged,'" said the pastor. "Be not too hard upon the baron, friend Carl. He may yet prove to be less culpable than he appears to be to you at present." 
               "I hope so," returned the pilot, as, seizing his hat, he started to perform his errand. 
               On his return to the Strand Gaden, the pastor's way led him near the court-house, into which he entered, thinking it likely, as the hour for opening the court had arrived, that he might find the baron seated on the bench; but he learned that a message had been sent to the assistant judges to inform them that the baron was indisposed, and would not be present that day, and one of the assistant judges occupied the baron's seat on the bench. 
               This sudden indisposition, viewed in connection with the singular conduct of the baron on the previous day, and the abrupt adjournment of the court, which followed the interruption occasioned by the entrance of Carl Jansen and his presentation of a note or letter to the judge, was the occasion of much surmise; but the pastor mingled with the crowd, and soon found out that nothing was known of the actual facts. 
               Quitting the court-house, the pastor hastened to the baron's residence on the Strand Gaden, and found the baron still in his bedroom. He had risen from his bed, but felt too unwell to leave his room. 
               The pastor related to his patron the nature of the conversation he had held with Carl Jansen; and then strove to calm the excitement under which his patron still labored, in order to prepare him for the exciting interview with his long-lost daughter, which was expected to take place in the course of a few hours. 
               The hour of noon came and passed, and though Carl had been expected before this hour, he had not yet arrived. One o'clock-two o'clock came, and still no appearance of Carl. The baron again became somewhat excited, and the pastor began to feel both vexed and alarmed; perhaps, he thought, Carl has played me false, and disclosed all to Louise, and she will not come; or, perchance she is too ill to come. 
               At length, just upon the stroke of three o'clock, the arrival of Carl was announced by a servant, and the pastor descended the stairs to meet him, and, as he supposed, his young and interesting companion. 
               To the surprise and dismay of the pastor, Carl was alone, and the expression of his countenance was indicative of vexation and alarm. 
               "Why, friend Carl, where is Louise?" inquired the pastor. 
               "She can not be found, Herr Pastor," was Carl's reply. 
               "Can not be found!" exclaimed the pastor. "Have you learned at what house she stopped last night, Carl?" 
               "Yes, Herr Pastor, I have found out the house where Christian and Margaret Jansen stopped last night, and where Louise stopped until last night; but she did not return home after the trial was concluded." 
               "God bless me!" exclaimed the pastor; "the poor girl was led in a fainting condition from the court-room. She is doubtless lying ill and unable to remove from the room to which she was conducted. This must be seen to, Carl. I will put on my hat and accompany you thither immediately." 
               "She is not there, Herr Pastor," replied Carl. "Hilda is at the house of my uncle and aunt. She was carried there from the court-house in a state of insensibility, from which she did not recover until this morning. Louise is not one who would become thus paralyzed in such an emergency as this. I have seen her, Herr Baron, slender, quiet child as she is, brave and resolute as a man in many an hour of peril." 
               "But have you been to the court-house and made inquiries respecting her? You say she is not there?" 
                
               "I have, Herr Pastor. She left the court-house at the same time with Hilda, in company with Christian and Margaret and Hans Petersen. They all followed the carriage which was procured to convey Hilda home." 
               "And yet she never arrived at home!" exclaimed Herr Bredell. "How is this? When was she missed by her companions?" 
               "She was not seen after having left the court-house. They all separated in the crowd which quitted the court-house at the same time with them," replied Carl. 
               "Did no one go in search of her?" 
               "Yes, Herr Pastor, Hans Petersen searched for her until ten o'clock, in vain, when he returned; and shortly after this he went home to the house at which he stops when in Bergen." 
               "This is a serious matter, Carl," said the pastor. "Perhaps she visited Rolf in the jail, and has remained there." 
               "I have been to the jail, Herr Pastor, and have seen Rolf, poor fellow! He has been expecting Louise all the morning, and felt sad that no one had called to visit him. I had not the heart to tell him that Louise could not be found." 
               "Did you see the jailor, or the matron of the jail?" 
               "I did, Herr Pastor; Louise has not called at the jail. I called also on Herr Staynor, whom I found with considerable difficulty." 
               "And he has not seen Louise?" 
               "No, Herr Pastor. He seems to sympathize deeply with the unfortunate family, and expressed both surprise and alarm at the disappearance of Louise. I called also upon Erik Lodbrok, who accompanied the Herren Staynor and Harcourt up the Hardenger Fjeld. He says he does not know where Louise is; he has not seen her; though, for the matter of that, he is too drunk to know what he is talking about. The beast got drunk immediately after he had given his evidence in court, and was put out by the officers when endeavoring to re-enter the courtroom in a state of intoxication. He has been drinking ever since." 
               "What can be done?" said the pastor. Information must be given at the police-office. Something serious must have happened to the poor girl." 
               A peculiar expression of mingled hesitation and alarm in the countenance of Carl attracted the observation of the pastor at the conclusion of his last remark. 
               "Friend Carl, you have heard something which you hesitate to repeat," he said; "you know where Louise is secreted?" 
               "Herr Pastor," replied Carl, "I have heard something to which I am unwilling to give credence. I do not-can not believe it possible." 
               "Good heavens! what can you have heard, friend Carl?" exclaimed the pastor, now seriously alarmed. 
               The pilot still hesitated; but at length explained that he had called at the abode of Hans Petersen, and had been told that a young woman answering to the appearance of Louise had called on Hans at eleven o'clock on the previous evening, and that she and Hans had left the house together about midnight, and that Hans had not since returned. 
               He had, upon hearing this, gone to the wharf at which Hans's sloop was usually moored, and found that the sloop was not there. He had then made inquiries of the fishermen whose vessels were moored near by, who had informed him that Hans Petersen had put to sea shortly after midnight. He inquired if any body was seen to go on board the sloop besides the man and boy who composed its crew, and was told that a woman, closely muffled up, was seen to accompany Hans on board. To his further inquiry, whether they had taken notice whether the woman was young or old, the fishermen had jestingly replied, that those who knew Hans would not suspect him of choosing an old woman for his companion, though it was so dark that the form of the woman, let alone her features, could not be discerned. 
               One of the fishermen called after him as he turned away and jestingly inquired whether he had lost his wife and suspected Hans of eloping with her. 
                
               To this account of Carl's the pastor listened with unequivocal signs of doubt as to its truth. He believed, with Carl, that it was impossible that Louise could have been guilty of such faithlessness and indelicacy as this rumor would imply. There must, he thought, be some mistake, and yet how could the disappearance of both Louise and Hans be accounted for. 
               He dismissed Carl with directions to apply to the police of the city; bidding him neglect no effort, and spare no expense in endeavoring to discover the whereabouts of the young woman. He furthermore promised to assist him personally in his endeavors, and then returned to the baron whom he found in a state of great excitement, anxiously awaiting the anticipated interview with his long-lost daughter, and wondering what could cause the delay in the appearance of the pastor and Louise. 
               The kind-hearted clergyman was afraid to relate the whole truth. Indeed, as we have shown, he doubted the truth of what Carl had been told, as did the honest pilot himself. To the baron's anxious inquiries, he replied that Carl had searched for Louise, but had hitherto been unable to find her, and that it was probable she had gone to reside temporarily with some friend outside the city. 
               With this explanation the baron was compelled to be content, and at the suggestion of the pastor, the appointed interview with Carl, in the evening, was dispensed with, as it would only tend to create additional excitement, without answering any effective purpose. 
               The baron was prevailed upon to lie down and endeavor to obtain a few hours' sleep, and the pastor then set forth to assist the pilot in tracing out Louise. 
               Carl met Herr Bredell on the wharf, whither the pastor had proceeded when he quitted the Strand Gaden. The pilot had, as he informed the pastor, a second time visited the residence of Hans, and satisfied himself that the information he had before received was correct. 
                
               It was certain, also, that the sloop owned by Hans Petersen, ha! left the barbor. A score of fishermen, who knew the vessel well, had seen her at daylight in the morning nearly hull down in the offing. Every thing seemed to point to the fact that Louise had quitted Bergen under the protection of Hans. 
               From the wharf the pastor and Carl proceeded to the jail, and obtained admission to the cell in which Rolf was confined. In the court-yard they met Christian and Margaret Jansen, and Hilda, the latter having sufficiently recovered to admit of her venturing abroad; all were bound on a like errand of mercy-to visit the unfortunate Rolf. 
               To the inquiry of the pastor, whether any thing had yet been heard by them of Louise, they replied in the negative, and they were admonished, in pity to Rolf, not to speak of her disappearance from the city, but to endeavor to frame some excuse that would account for her absence. 
               When they were admitted to the cell in which Rolf was confined, Hilda was a second time overcome by the intensity of her grief to such a degree that she fainted and remained unconscious during the entire period of the interview. Rolf was pale, but calm and collected. He persisted in declaring himself innocent in thought, as well as in deed, of the crime imputed to him, and expressed great satisfaction when informed by the pastor and by Carl, as well as by Christian and Margaret, that they never could be brought to believe him guilty. 
               He inquired anxiously after Louise, and asked why she had not called to see him. He was told by Margaret that she was unable to come. 
               "Poor girl," he replied, "tell her from me that she must not take this unfortunate affair so much to heart. She must bear up under it as I strive to do. Some day my innocence will be proved. I feel it will be so. Tell Louise I shall look for her-to-morrow." 
               The short hour allotted to visitors soon flew by, and the jailor appeared and stated that the party must leave the jail. Hilda, still unconscious, was carried out into the corridor by the pastor and Carl, Christian and Margaret following. Rolf shook hands with his friends and kissed his sister's cheek, as the party quitted his cell. "Mind," he said to Margaret Jansen, "mind, mother, I shall look for a visit from Louise tomorrow." 
               Discouraged and disheartened, the pastor separated himself from the rest of the party and returned to the house of the baron, whom he found up and dressed, and greatly refreshed by the few hours' sleep he had enjoyed. He expressed his intention of remaining still another day absent from his duties at the court-house; to-morrow, he said, he should remain at home to meet his long lost child, whose place of abode in or near Bergen would certainly be found ere then, and he that night retired to his luxurious couch, as Rolf stretched himself upon the hard straw mattrass in his cell, both eagerly looking forward to the relief the morrow would bring; but the morrow came and passed away, and yet another, and another day, and still there came no tidings of Louise. 
               The baron could no longer be deceived. He was told at last that Louise had left the city immediately after the trial. 
               The information was conveyed to him by the pastor, as gently and delicately as possible, but, for the moment, the blow unmanned him. 
               For the first time since the loss of his wife and, as he believed, his only child, he bowed his head and in the intensity of his grief shed tears. 
               "O God!" exclaimed the unhappy man, "thou afflictest me sorely. I acknowledge thy justice. Yet, in mercy, stay thy avenging hand. Let not my punishment be greater than I can bear." 
               For several hours he gave full vent to the grief long pent up in his bosom, and refused to be comforted; but the fountain of sorrow at length ceased to flow. He rose from his recumbent posture; by an almost superhuman effort, succeeded in controlling trolling his feelings and, to the surprise of his friend, the pastor, declared his intention of resuming his duties on the bench on the following day. 
               And in the cell in which Rolf was confined, the morrow came and passed, and yet another, and another, and another, yet Louise came not to comfort the prisoner whose soul was bound up in hers, and who felt more for her than he did for himself; and no one had the heart to tell Rolf why she came not! He still believed that she was ill-perhaps ill beyond hope of recovery. False messages, framed in pity to the unhappy prisoner and lover, were brought to him, as coming from Louise, bidding him bear himself bravely for her sake. It was a cruel and yet a loving kindness on the part of Hilda and Margaret Jansen, which induced them, day by day, to frame those false messages. Had Rolf been led to doubt the goodness and fidelity of Louise, he would have sank beneath the weight of the increased affliction such a belief would have wrought. 
               During the last two days of the session the baron occupied his accustomed seat on the bench. He looked pale and haggard. Those who looked upon him wondered why he appeared abroad, so ill as he evidently was; but save in appearance, no change was observable in him. His demeanor was grave and dignified as ever, and he still paid his accustomed attention to the details of the cases brought before him. 
               At length the closing day of the session arrived in which the prisoners who had been convicted were brought up for sentence. 
               The friends of the prisoners were generally present, and many of the spectators noticed that the gaze of the baron wandered curiously toward the place usually appointed to these persons, and toward the galleries, as if he were seeking some one. Perchance he thought that at this awful moment Louise might make her appearance, to get one glimpse of her lover before he was separated from her. But he was evidently disappointed. 
                
               One by one the convicted prisoners were brought forward by the jailors from the room in which they were confined, and placed in the dock to receive sentence, those convicted of lesser crimes first, and son on, one after the other, as the crimes were of deeper dye. 
               Rolf was the last prisoner brought into the dock. It was notice that when his name was called, the pale visage of the baron became of a more death-like pallor, and for a moment his tightly-compressed lips quivered-but only for a moment. 
               This emotion passed away, and he sat on the bench the stern, calm, dignified judge, dispensing to evil-doers the penalties demanded by Justice, to avenge the outrages committed against her laws. 
               Great interest was manified by the spectators when Rolf was brought into the court-room, and all eyes were directed toward him. He looked thin and pale; but he bore himself firmly, as if conscious that he had been unjustly accused, and was resolved through his bearing, silently to assert his innocence to the last. 
               He fixed his gaze upon the judge. Once only, for a moment, his eyes wandered off from the bench in the direction of the seat occupied by christian Jansen, who of all his friends was alone recognized among the crowd, as if he thought that perchance Louise might have nerved herself to appear at this trying moment. But he did not see her, and he again fixed his gaze upon the bench. 
               "Rolf Frode," said the baron, in a firm tone of voice, "you have been found guilty of a heinous crime, the guilt attending which has been aggravated by ingratitude; for he who has perished by your hand had proved himself to be one of your best friends. 
               "It is my duty now to pronounce upon the sentence which I was prevented from pronouncing on a former occasion by an untoward interruption which led me to suspend the proceedings of the court. 
                
               "It is my duty to inform you that the testimony in favor of your former character has been by me duly considered. I shall forward this testimony to the proper authorities, and it may induce them to mitigate the heavy penalty I am about to pronounce; but I can not allow it to have any weight with me at this time and in this place. 
               "The sentence of the court is, that you be conveyed to the castle of *  *  *" 
               A terrific sound of cheering in the street in front of the court-house prevented the voice of the judge from being heard. Another moment and the cheers were taken up by the spectators at the entrance of the court-room. In vain the crier called for silence. Equally in vain the constables endeavored to enforce the orders of the judges, and to clear the court-room. A dense body of people forced their way into the room in spite of the officers, until it was crowded with a solid mass of humanity, so closely jammed together that the slightest movement was impossible. Presently, however, the crowd divided in the center, as if by a simultaneous pressure on either side, which tore up the benches, and displaced the tables and stands, affording a free passage from the entrance of the court-room to the bench on which the judges sate. A death-like stillness succeeded to the uproar which but a moment before had rent the air outside and shook the building within, as, proceeding through this passage, between the two dense masses of spectators on either hand, were seen an aged man attired in the garb of a kine-herd of the mountains, followed by two porters, bearing between them the body of a man, wrapped up in a cloak in such a manner that his features would have been scarcely discernible, even if his face had not been covered, as it was, with bandages, and behind this seeing invalid walked a young man and a young woman, in whose persons the judges on the bench and the prisoner, and many of the spectators, recognized Hans Petersen and Louise Sigvald. 
               Scarcely had the porters set down their burden, before a young man, who was seated on the bench beside the judges, sprang forward, and grasped the hand of the invalid. It was Charles Staynor, who had recognized Henry Harcourt. His greeting was heard, and the name he pronounced was caught up by those standing nearest to him. 
               "The Herr Harcourt! The Herr Harcourt! Pardon! Pardon! The prisoner is free! He is not guilty!" resounded through the court-room, and the cry was caught up by the crowd outside, many among whom had climbed up to the windows, and completely darkened the room. 
               "Arrest Erik Lodbrok; do not let him escape-I charge him with perjury," shouted the clear, ringing voice of Hans Petersen above the clamors of the throng, the oaths of men, and the shrieks of women, who had been borne down by the crowd. 
               The excitement was intense. Still the crowd from outside attempted to pour in, and the passage which had been opened was filled up, until the slightest movement was impossible. The platform on which stood the bench occupied by the judges, the witness box, the jury box, the rooms leading from the courtroom, from which the doors had been torn from their hinges, were all filled to suffocation. The only safety appeared to be in closing the outer doors of the court-house. This was at length done by the officers of the court, and then, order having been partially restored, the now affrighted spectators were ordered to depart, a few at a time, by a private door in the rear of the bench. 
               In the course of half an hour the court-room was cleared of the dense throng, although the crowd outside still filled the street, and rent the air with their shouts. 
               Amid all this excitement and confusion, the Baron Von Welden had remained calm and collected. 
               "Take heed, officers, that Erik Lodbrok does not pass out of the court-room," he exclaimed, in a loud, clear voice, when the outer doors had been closed. "I saw him present here just now." 
                
               Presently a cry arose that Erik Lodbrok was arrested, and was in the custody of an officer. 
               "Clear the court-room of all the spectators," said the baron. "Officers, look to the prisoner; where is he?" 
               Rolf had fainted in the dock, and was now lying on the floor, his head supported by one of the constables. 
               This was explained to the baron, who replied, 
               "Remove him to a private room, and see that every attention is paid to him. He stands acquitted-honorably acquitted of the crime imputed to him." 
               In the course of a quarter of an hour more, the court-room was cleared of every person but the judges, the officers of the court, the members of the bar, who occupied the seats at the table from which they had been driven by the excited crowd, and the friends of the late prisoner. 
               The baron then called upon Louise Sigvald to state the circumstances which had led to the recovery of the body of the supposed murdered man; but Louise, who had borne up nobly under the excitement of the trying scene, was now unable to respond to the summons, and Hans Petersen briefly testified to the circumstances which led to the discovery that Herr Harcourt was still living, and to his removal from the hut among the mountains, to which he had been carried by the cow-herd after his fall from the brow of the precipice, as related by Rolf. 
               Sufficient evidence was shown to compel the court to hold Erik Lodbrok to answer the charge of perjury, and the court was finally adjourned for the session. 
               By this time Rolf had been restored to consciousness, and was led out of the court-room by Hans, amid the congratulations of the judges, the officers of the court, and his friends. 
               He was seized, when he reached the street, by four men from among the still excited crowd, and borne in triumph to the house occupied by Christian Jansen, and others of his friends; and Erik was consigned to jail to await his trial at the next session of the court. 
                
               The present was no time to explain to Louise and Hilda and the newly liberated prisoner, the discoveries which had been made in relation to the secret of their birth, and the alterations in their future circumstances which would, in consequence naturally ensue. 
               The pastor took an opportunity to warn Carl Jansen to remain silent upon the subject until the present excitement had subsided, which he readily promised to do. 
               Henry Harcourt was conveyed to the lodgings of his friend Staynor, in a carriage, both young men having accepted an invitation from the baron to visit him at his chteau-to which he was about to return now that the session was over-before they left the country; and the several parties departed to their respective homes, to congratulate each other afresh, and to talk over the exciting events of the day. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXI. 
               THE DRUNKARD'S CONFESSION. 
               TO explain the circumstances, already mentioned as having been briefly narrated before the court by Hans Petersen, and which led to the gratifying results recorded in the preceding chapter, it will be necessary to revert to the close of the trial of Rolf Frode on the opening day of the session. 
               On leaving the court-house by a private door of exit, Louise, Hans Petersen, and Christian and Margaret Jansen followed closely behind the carriage which had been procured to convey Hilda to her lodgings-she being too ill to walk home. When arrived at the main street, toward which the court-house fronted, the party was met by the crowed, which, after the abrupt adjournment of the court, by the baron, was emerging from the main entrance. The throng was so dense that the little party became separated, and Louise, to avoid the collision to which she was continually subjected, retreated to the shelter of a doorway. Here she remained until the crowd had partially dispersed, or had gathered into small, separate groups, when she looked around for her friends, but was unable to discern them. 
               Being entirely a stranger to the streets of Bergen, she was at a loss which way to proceed; and too diffident to make inquiry of strangers, she wandered on in the direction which she fancied would lead her to her lodgings. She proceeded, however, in the wrong direction, and soon found herself amid a labyrinth of streets, and in a part of the city she had never before visited. She had quite forgotten, in the excitement under which she labored, the name of the street in which Christian Jansen lodged. Deeply absorbed in thought, she had taken no heed of time, and must have been walking for more than an hour, for twilight was approaching, and when she had left the court-house, though the evening was advanced-for it is customary to sit late in court in Norway-it was yet broad daylight. At length she called to mind the name of a street near that in which old Jansen lived, and made inquiry of the first person she met, as to the nearest way to reach it. She was informed that she was in quite the opposite part of the city; that the distance was fully two miles through the city, but that there was a shorter cut by a lonely road, which would save a considerable portion of the distance. 
               The road was pointed out to her, and she followed the direction given her without hesitation. Brought up as she had been on the island of Sartaroe, where she was safe from insult, no matter at what hour of the day or night she might venture abroad, she was haunted with none of those alarms which, on such occasions as this, terrify the female residents of crowded cities; yet there were only three or four widely-scattered houses in a distance of a quarter of a mile, and not a living creature was to be seen on the road. 
               When, however, she had progressed about half the distance over which she had to pass before she reached the more crowded thoroughfares, she saw a man approaching from the opposite direction, staggering to and fro, and singing and gesticulating violently. 
               As he drew nearer she recognized Erik Lodbrok. For a long time she had felt a secret repugnance to this man, though, until of late, she had found it difficult to assign a reason why, for Erik had been one of her most ardent admirers, and had always treated her with respect; but the events of the last few days had changed this secret repugnance to positive fear and dislike. 
               She knew that Erik was accustomed to drink freely; indeed this habit was so prevalent among the class to which he belonged, that it was not looked upon with the horror with which it is regarded by more temperate societies; but never before had she seen him so completely under the influence of liquor. 
               Her first thought was to turn back and endeavor to avoid meeting him, but he had already recognized her, and called to her by name, therefore retreat was impossible. 
               She advanced boldly toward him. 
               "Ha! pretty Louise," said he, "what has brought you out here, my bird, at this time of night? Did you come to seek Erik Lodbrok, eh? Come, take my arm. Let us walk together; I have something to say to you, only-I've drank too much brandy-vin. But what matter?" and he commenced roaring out the following stanza from a popular Norwegian drinking song: 
                      
                        "Og Skam faae den, som elsker Tvang, 
                        Som hader Piger, Viin og Sang."
                              "Curse on the slave who hugs his chains,
                              And women, wine, and song disdains."
                           
                         
                     
                  
                
               As he ceased singing, he offered to take the young girl by the hand: but she hastily drew back, and endeavoring to disguise the fear that she really felt, said she had missed her way, and requested him to direct her the nearest way to her grandfather's lodgings. 
               "Pooh! pooh! There is no hurry, why talk of home on such a fine evening as this?" replied Erik, and again he began to sing: 
                      
                        "My home is on the mountain, 
                        My home is in the fell." 
                     
                  
                
               The words of the song opened a new idea to his drunken imagination. 
               "Yes, my home is on the mountain," said he. "I know one cursed dog who has found a home on the mountain, and another beast who will find a home deep enough in the fell, out of which he will find it hard to escape. Come, Louise, I have something to tell you;" and again he attempted to seize the young girl's hand. 
               "Pray, Erik, let me pass quietly, and seek my own way home, if you will not direct me," said Louise, still endeavoring to conceal her fears, but, at the same time, retreating beyond Erik's reach. 
               "Will not direct you, Louise?" exclaimed Erik. "When did you ask me a favor I did not grant? Did not I risk my life to help to pick up that cursed Englishman, who I wish had been at the bottom of the North Sea before I ever saw him. I am going back to the city. I will show you the way, or, if you like, you shall go home with me," and he turned about as he spoke, and requested Louise to walk by his side. 
               Unable to get quit of him, and thinking it the safer plan to indulge his humor, until, arrived in the city, she could claim the protection of the passers by if she found it necessary, Louise walked by his side, keeping herself, however, a reasonable distance from him. 
               In his drunken humor he now appeared to indulge the idea that Louise had accompanied him of her own free choice, and he commenced to talk incoherently to himself, as he staggered along by her side. 
               Some of the expressions which escaped his lips attracted the attention of the maiden. She listened more attentively, and at length found courage to inquire, in regard to a remark he made in allusion to Rolf, how it were possible that Rolf could be guilty of the crime of which he was accused, it Herr Henry was still living. 
               "Because he is a beast," said Erik; "but who said that the cursed Englishman is living?" 
               "I understood you to say so just now, Erik." 
               "Ha, ha! did you, my bird? Good. Then you understood me to say what is false." 
               "But you told me, Erik, that if I accompanied you, you would tell me a secret?" 
                
               "Did I?" said Erik. "Well, I think I did; but I sha'n't though. A woman can't keep a secret." 
               He drew a flash containing corn brandy from his breast pocket, and drank from it a long draught, and then offered it to Louise, who shook her head, upon which he replaced it in his pocket, saying, 
               "Well, my bird, if you don't like brandy-vin, there is more left for those who do, and I, Erik Lodbrok, am one of those who do." 
               For some time he walked on in silence, though it was evident to Louise, from the increased unsteadiness of his gait, that the last draught of brandy had considerably added to his previous inebriety. 
               Once or twice she felt inclined to run from him, confident that, in his present condition, he could not overtake her, even if he were to commence a pursuit. But the desire to more fully comprehend the expressions which had escaped his lips, incoherent as they were, still detained her near him. 
               He appeared to take pleasure in the confidence she seemed to have in him, and, after humming a snatch or two from different drinking songs, he again commenced to converse, though with so thick an utterance that his words were scarcely intelligible. 
               "Now-now-you can not marry Rolf, nor, nor the cursed Englishman, Louise-you might-as well marry me-"he stammered forth. "Louise-my-my pretty bird, I am richer than-than Rolf-the beast-ever was, or, or will be. I am a pilot, and have a pilot-boat of my own. Ha! ha! how easily I spoiled Rolf's game-the beast. You-you won't be married to Rolf this year, Louise." 
               Louise was strongly inclined to ask how he had spoiled Rolf's game, as he phrased it; but she was fearful of exciting suspicions in his mind that she was endeavoring to draw his secrets from him, although he had already said enough to lead her to suspect that he knew more about the disappearance of the young Englishman than he had disclosed from the witness-box. Thinking, however, that if she pretended to profess an indifference toward Rolf, she might succeed better in gaining her companion's confidence, she replied to his taunt by saying, 
               "Indeed, Erik, I never expected to be married to Rolf, this year." 
               "Ho! ho!" exclaimed Erik. "You had given him up for the sake of the cursed Englishman, then. Ha! ha! ha!" he laughed. "Rolf-the beast-got a boat in exchange for his sweetheart." 
               At any other moment, and under any other circumstances, indignation on hearing this brutal speech, and the disgraceful innuendo it implied, would have sealed the maiden's lips and led her to turn away with loathing and scorn from the speaker, but she had heard sufficient to induce her to believe that Erik knew that respecting the disappearance, or perhaps the murder of the young Englishman, which would clear Rolf from guilt, or even suspicion of guilt, and again she replied, 
               "Erik, you speak foolishly. I know nothing of Herr Henry, except that he was shipwrecked on our coast, and that he was treated with hospitality by my grandfather and myself, which hospitality he generously requited." 
               "You-care nothing-for-him?" stammered Erik. 
               "Nothing more than that I should be glad to learn that he has not perished miserably on the mountain, and by Rolf hand. If I can not become the wife of Rolf, I would not wish him to undergo the punishment inflicted upon a murderer, if he is not guilty of the crime." 
               "Will you promise-to-to be my wife, if I tell you the secret, I promised, Louise?" said Erik. 
               "Nay, I can not promise that, Erik," said Louise, shrinking back and shuddering, as she spoke. "I must take time to think of it," she added. 
               "We will go-away-far from here. I-I am a pilot. We will go-go, to Christiania, Louise. I-I shall-soon learn to-to know the coast. W-what d-do you say?" 
                
               "I will think of it, Erik," replied the maiden, with another sickening shudder, which she strove in vain to suppress, fearful that Erik would observe the disgust she was unable to conceal. "But," she added, "you have not yet told me the secret." 
               "S'pose we get mar-married first, and go-o away from this place," stammered Erik. 
               "But what good would that do to Herr Henry or Rolf?" said Louise. "You said you could tell me that which would free Rolf from a suspicion of guilt. I should like to know that for-for his sister Hilda's sake." 
               Erik regarded her for some moments with the fixed, owl-like gaze of drunkenness. Apparently he was satisfied, for he replied, 
               "Yes-for Hilda's sake-I-I have nothing to say against Hilda." 
               "And you can restore her brother to her?" said Louise. "Do that, and Hilda will bless you, and I-I will think of what I have said." 
               Louise's earnestness had well-nigh betrayed her. Erik looked at her with doubt. Had he been less under the influence of liquor, he would have been on his guard; but he, apparently, soon forgot his suspicion. 
               "Ha, ha, ha!" he chuckled. "Poor Hilda: no, it would, not bring her brother back; for the Englishman-curse him-is dead, and buried among the mountains before this, and I, only, know where. I shall not tell all I know, because-because, I-won't put my own liberty-in-in peril; but, Louise, Rolf-the-the beast-did not-kill him." 
               Again Louise was on the point of betraying the deep interest she felt in all that the drunken brute by her side gave utterance to; but she restrained herself, and by dint of the ingenuity which woman only can display under such circumstances as this, she gleaned from Erik the facts, intermingled with many incoherencies, that he, while searching for Rolf and the young Englishman, had come upon the hut of a cow-herd, into which the body of a man, whom he recognized, bruised and disfigured as he was, as the Herr Henry Harcourt. The cow-herd and his wife were the sole occupants of the hut. The man was one of the semi-savage mountaineers who are occasionally to be met with among the mountain fastnesses-who seldom visit the cities, or even the villages, except at certain seasons of the year, when they come down from the mountains to dispose of the few cattle they possess. This man informed Erik that he had seen the traveler fall from the side of a rocky precipice which he was attempting to scale, and that immediately after he had fallen he hastened to the spot to see if he was still alive. His pulse beat feebly, but he was insensible, and, as the cow-herd thought, was dying. However, he had humanely borne him to his hut, but a short distance from the spot, and with the assistance of his wife had endeavored to resuscitate him, although there appeared little chance of his recovery. 
               He (Erik) had frightened the old man, by telling him that if the stranger died, and it became known in Bergen that he died in his hut, he would be held answerable for his death. He advised the mountaineer to carry him back to the place where he had fallen, and leave him to his fate; but the old fool, as Erik said, had refused to be guilty of such inhumanity, but had replied that, if the stranger lived, he would do all in his power to restore him to health, for though he was shockingly cut and bruised, no bones were broken; and if he died, he would bury him, with the assistance of his wife, among the mountains. No one in Bergen, he said, would be any the wiser. If, on the contrary, he should recover, he would certainly recompense those who had rescued him for their trouble and care. Erik was satisfied, in his own mind, that Harcourt could not recover; hence his statement to Louise that he had died and been buried among the mountains, before the day of the trial. Quitting the cabin of the mountaineer, Erik then rejoined Staynor, and having induced the latter to follow a track which led him in a direction contrary to the path which led to the cow-herd's hut, they parted to renew the search. Subsequently he had found Harcourt's pocket-book and pistol. It was his belief at first, that both Rolf and Harcourt had fallen from the precipice, and he was surprised to learn, when he and Staynor fell in with the villagers who had been dispatched in search of them, that Rolf had returned to the hamlet. Still he thought he had evidence sufficient to make it appear that Rolf was guilty of the murder of Harcourt, and he resolved to gratify his hatred of his rival by denouncing him as a murderer. For this reason, after he learned that Rolf had returned to the hamlet, he had still refrained from telling Staynor that his fellow traveler had been discovered by the mountaineer. 
               The result the reader is already cognizant of. The main facts of this long story were with great difficulty extracted from Erik by Louise, and they had nearly reached the abode of the former before he had finished it. 
               Louise knew that she had but little time to lose. She had but one question more to ask, and she trembled lest the answer to this should be refused, and all the information she had received be rendered unavailable, for the cool air of the evening and the exercise he had taken had somewhat sobered Erik, and he had begun to grow cautious and silent. 
               With ready tact she bethought herself of a scheme, the execution of which was not only pardonable but praiseworthy, when the results she hoped to gain by means of it are taken into consideration. 
               Pretending fatigue, she asked Erik to let her drink from his brandy-flask. He readily handed it to her, and putting it to her lips she pretended to drink, and then, handing it back, requested him to drink also. Erik needed no second invitation. He emptied the flask at a draught, and flung it to the ground. It had yet contained a full half pint of strong corn-brandy, and the effects of the draught were speedily visible in the young man's rolling eyes, and more unsteady gait, and thick utterance. Louise feared that she had overreached her purpose; but Erik's head was strong enough to bear any quantity of liquor without its having the power to intoxicate him beyond a certain point. He might have been compared to a ship which can be brought to her bearings readily, but which will carry an immense amount of cargo, without any sensible difference being perceived in her draft of water. 
               Again he commenced to shout his drinking choruses, greatly to the disgust and shame of the maiden, for they had now entered into the busy thoroughfares of the city, and, late as was the hour, a great many persons were abroad, who gazed with astonishment upon the drunken man and his neat and modest-looking companion; but Louise had yet a point to gain, and she endured even this shame for the sake of Rolf and Hilda. 
               "Erik," she said, "you have not yet told me whereabouts it was on the mountains that Herr Henry fell?" 
               "And what does it concern you to know, my pretty bird?" said Erik. "The cursed Englishman is dead; and Rolf, the beast, is in jail, and will be confined in chains for the remainder of his life, and you and I, my bird, will get married, and go to Christiania;" and he commenced to troll forth another chorus. 
               "I want to know, Erik," interrupted Louise, with trembling eagerness, "where this accident happened. You do not care to tell me," she added, with pretended peevishness. 
               "Fiskin Svomme" (may fishes swim), exclaimed Erik, using a good-humored Norsk expletive, common to the fishermen of the country; "but you women-kind are never satisfied. But you shall know, my bird, since I have told you the rest. The hut of the kine-herd is situated at the foot of the Folgefond. Now, are you contented?" 
               "Yes," replied Louise. 
               "Here is my cage, into which my bird must enter," said Erik, as they approached the house in which he lodged. 
               "No-no; not now, Erik; another time," said Louise. 
               "Nay, nay; now," exclaimed Erik, catching hold of her by both hands, and attempting to drag her into the house, the door of which was open. 
               With an effort of which, under other circumstances, she would have been incapable, Louise disengaged herself from the drunken man's grasp, and ran from the house. Erik started in pursuit; but his course was arrested by a passer-by, who had witnessed the occurrence, and who placed himself in front of him. The drunkard fell to the ground, from which he rose with some difficulty, and, muttering several frightful oaths, he staggered into the house. Calling for more brandy, he swallowed the fiery liquid at a draught, and throwing himself at full length on a rude wooden bench, was soon fast locked in a drunken slumber. 
               Louise breathed more freely when she found herself no longer in close contact with the wretch from whose clutches she had escaped. 
               "Can it be possible," she thought, "that Erik, whom I have known since was a little child, is such a villain? An idler, and sometimes a drunkard, I knew him to be; but I never could have believed, unless I had not proof from his own lips, that he is such a wretch!" 
               Other matters, however, soon occupied her thoughts. She felt that it was necessary to make use of the information she had received as quickly as possible. She was aware that something had occurred to delay the immediate passing of the sentence of the court upon Rolf; but she knew not what it was. Ignorant of all that appertains to a court of justice, she attached some vague terror to the act of passing sentence. She had an impression that sentence, once pronounced, no subsequent discovery of Rolf's innocence could avail him aught, and sentence had only been deferred for a few days. There was no time to lose. Whatever could be done must be done directly-one hour's delay might ruin all! 
               "To whom shall I apply?" she thought. "To Herr Staynor? I know not where to find him, and he might not believe me; he is desirous that Rolf shall suffer. He would wait till morning and see. Erik, and then Erik might deny all that he has said. He would do so. To the judge himself?" She shook her head. "He would refuse to see me. Nay, I could not get admittance to him; and, if I did, it would be useless. I must go myself to the Hardenger Fjeld, and discover whether Herr Henry is living or dead; and if he be dead, bring back the cow-herd with me, to confront Erik, and prove the innocence of Rolf, before the session close, and it is too late. I will seek out Hans Petersen, and tell him all. I can trust him," was the conclusion at which she at last arrived; and her mind once made up, she hastened to put her resolve into execution. 
               She was still ignorant of the way to Christian Jansen's lodgings, where she hoped to find Hans; but she soon recollected the name of the street, and on making inquiry learned that it was about half a mile distant. She hastened forward in the direction pointed out to her with all the speed of which she was capable; but had not proceeded half the distance when she met Hans, who had just left the residence of old Jansen, and was returning to his own home. 
               She ran breathlessly to meet him, eager to tell him what she had heard from Erik. 
               "Louise," said the young fisherman, "I have been searching for you all over the city. Christian and Margaret are greatly alarmed about you. What has happened to you?" 
               "Hans," she replied, her face flushed and her eyes glistening with eagerness to impart the information she had acquired, "I have seen Erik Lodbrok. Rolf is not guilty. That I knew before," she added, correcting herself, "but I can prove his innocence." 
               The young fisherman thought she was crazy; that the excitements of the day, together with her grief at the result of the trial, had disturbed her intellect. 
               "Let me see you home, Louise," he said, kindly. 
               "No, Hans, no. It will be useless to go home now I have met you," was her reply. "There is no time to be lost. Sentence must not be pronounced upon Rolf. I must go to the Hardanger Fjeld and discover whether Herr Henry is living or dead." 
               Hans shook his head sorrowfully. "Poor young thing!" he muttered to himself. Then addressing her again, he said, 
               "Louise, you are faint and wearied. Let me take you home." 
               "No, Hans; not until you have heard my story. You think I am talking wildly; but I have, indeed, but just left Erik Lodbrok, and he has assured me that Rolf is innocent; and I can prove it." 
               The earnestness of her manner made an impression upon Hans. "It may be true," he thought to himself; and then remarking the evident weariness of the young girl-weariness caused more by the excitement she had labored under than by physical exertion, he bethought him that his own lodging was near by, and regardless of those conventionalities of society of which both he and Louise were, in fact, ignorant; and regarding the maiden in the light of a sister or a playmate of his childhood, he asked her to go with him to his lodging and rest herself, and he would there listen to her story. 
               Seated in Hans Petersen's room, Louise frankly related all that had occurred to her from the moment she left the courthouse until she met with him. At the conclusion of her recital she earnestly begged him to accompany her to the mountains, whither she was determined to proceed, and expressed her intention, if he refused to undertake the journey, to go by herself. 
               Hans had listened attentively to her story, only interrupting her with occasional bursts of indignation leveled at Erik. He was as ignorant as was she, herself, of the methods of procedure in courts of justice, and impressed with the idea common to the peasantry and fishermen of Norway, that a sentence once pronounced by the courts can not be revoked; yet he hesitated before he ventured to reply. 
               Louise observed the hesitation expressed in his countenance. 
                
               "Heaven has interfered in our behalf, Hans," she said, reverentially, "in causing the sentence to be delayed till the close of the session, and throwing Erik Lodbrok in my way. Shall we neglect the opportunity afforded us?" 
               "No, Louise," replied Hans; "but you can not undertake a journey over the mountains; I will conduct you home, and will then set sail for Kongshun immediately." 
               "No, Hans," replied Louise, "I must accompany you. We must both go. Some accident might happen to one or other of us if we went alone, though I would find some one at Kongshun willing to accompany me to the Hardanger Fjeld, and you know well that I am not fearful of danger or fatigue. I have five specie dollars in my purse; that will be sufficient to defray the expenses I shall incur; if more is needed, I can borrow it at Kongshun. My grandfather will gladly repay the loan." 
               "You shall not go alone, Louise," said Hans; "not will you have any need of the money you speak of. My sloop lies at the wharf. I will unmoor her at once. The tide will turn in an hour, and we must not lose it, if we would save time. Yet I wish that, before you go, you would see your grandfather and Hilda, and inform them of your purpose." 
               "No, Hans; it would be useless; besides Erik might learn from them, by some means or other, that I have exposed his villainy, and take measures to disconcert my plans." 
               "That might be," replied Hans. "We will then set out at once. My crew are on board, and there shall be no delay." 
               "Thank you, good Hans," said the maiden, extending her hand to the young fisherman, her eyes sparkling with hope and gratitude. "I knew that you would aid me in my purpose." 
               In the course of a few minutes they quitted the lodging of a Hans together, and hastened to the wharf where the sloop lay moored. 
               "Can we reach the mountains and return before Monday next?" inquired Louise, as they walked together through the now deserted streets, a fresh apprehension of difficulty occurring to her. 
               "This is Monday," replied Hans. "With the fresh breeze that now blows we shall reach the head of the Fjord by to-morrow night. The Folgefond is but a few hours' distance from Kongshun, and I know where the hut of which Erik spoke is situated. We can reach it and return to the hamlet by Friday morning, and, if God speed us on our journey, be back in Bergen on Saturday, or Monday, at furthest." 
               They had, by this time, reached the sloop, which was soon under weigh and bounding along before a fair, strong breeze, in the direction of the mouth of the Hardanger Fjord. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXII. 
               THE HARDANGER FJELD. 
               THE distance, by water, from the port of Bergen to the head of the Hardanger Fjord is about seventy-five miles, provided always that the wind be sufficiently fair to allow a vessel to lie her course and to save the ground lost by taking. Hans Petersen, therefore, had not promised too much, taking into consideration the fresh westerly wind that was blowing, when he said they would, in all probability, reach the hamlet at the head of the Fjord in twenty-four hours. In fact, the distance was accomplished in less time, and the sloop reached the head of the Fjord during the afternoon of the following day. The trip of Harcourt and Staynor a few weeks previous, in Rolf's boat, had occupied a much longer period in its accomplishment; but then the wind was lighter and more variable, and the travelers were embarked on a tour of pleasure, and delayed their voyage unnecessarily by requesting the navigator of the little vessel on board of which they had embarked, to make frequent slants in shore, on either side, to enable them to view the scenery to better advantage. In the present instance there was no delay; the sloop was urged onward at her utmost speed, and child of nature as was Louise, and ardent admirer of the magnificent scenery of the land-as she believed-of her birth, the picturesque though savage beauty of the ever-varying land scape on either side of the Fjord, was, by her, utterly disregarded. 
               The hamlet of Kongshun
                     Kongshun is a small hamlet situated near the confluence of the several streams which hurry their waters into the Fjord, and is the key to the noble scenery near Vassenden. It has been described in this story as the residence of a few poor fishermen, who gain a precarious livelihood by fishing in the Fjord. Such was the case at the period when the romantic incident occurred on which the plot of the story is founded; but of late years the increase in the number of tourists who visit the Hardanger Fjeld, vi Bergen, has led to the establishment, in this hamlet, of several good, though small hotels, for the accommodation of travelers.
                   reached, Louise and her companion panion disembarked from the sloop, and were welcomed by the villagers, who flocked around them, all eager to learn how the trial had proceeded. They were briefly informed of the facts and the cause of the present visit of Hans and Louise. 
               It would not have been safe for Erik Lodbrok at this moment to have made his appearance in the hamlet. Loud and bitter were the execrations bestowed upon his villainy and perfidy, and no sooner was the object of the visitors made known, than a dozen hardy fishermen, all equally skilled in traversing the difficult and dangerous mountain passes, as in the often perilous navigation of the Fjord, volunteered to accompany Hans on his journey, while Louise was earnestly pressed to remain in the hamlet until their return. The generous offer of escort was thankfully accepted, but the maiden turned a deaf ear to every argument that was advanced to induce her to relinquish her purpose of proceeding herself to Folgefond. She seemed to be possessed with the idea that upon her mainly depended the success of the expedition, and appealed to Hans to prove that she had dared as great perils when necessity demanded it, on the island of Sartaroe, as any she was likely to encounter in traversing the passes of the Hardanger Fjeld. 
               Within an hour the party, consisting of Hans, Louise, and two villagers who had been accepted from among those who had offered to accompany them, set forth from the hamlet to ascend the mountain. 
               In describing the exploration of the Hardanger Fjeld by Harcourt and Staynor, in a preceding chapter, we did not mean it to be understood that they had traversed the whole of its immense plateau. The Fjeld covers a space of fifty miles in length and little less in breadth, and some of the loftiest peaks, such as the Jokelen and the Hallen Scarven, rise to an elevation of six thousand feet above the level of the sea, while the average level of the table-land is estimated to be about four thousand feet above the sea. 
               During the greater part of the year this plateau is covered with snow. It is broken by undulating masses of bare rock, spreads into vast plains of morass, and sinks into shallow valleys, in the hollows of which are sometimes found chains of small torns or mountain lakes, generally half-frozen, and ted by torrents, which take their rise in the higher ranges, and are increased by the melting of the snows in summer. The general aspect of the range is wild and sterile, in the extreme, but some of the more sheltered valleys, which have a southern exposure, present, during the short months of a northern summer, a verdant aspect, the more agreeable from the sterility of the rocks with which they are surrounded. 
               Here and there, at wide distances apart, in these valleys, may be found rude shanties generally constructed of loose stones, and occupied by goat and kine-herds, who, though simple-minded, honest, brave and hospitable, are superstitious to a degree, and as ignorant of the habits and usages of the members of more civilized society, as the natives of the islands of the Pacific ocean. 
               Over these mountains there are no roads, and beyond three days' journey from the western base of the Fjeld, there is no practicable pass. 
               Few tourists penetrate beyond the Tessungdal, an inaccessible mountain barrier which divides the eastern and western portions of the range. The Tessungdal dome gives its name to a vast unexplored space, in some portions of which the foot of man has never trod; a region of rock and precipice, interspersed with marshes and lakes and foaming cascades, and destitute of vegetation of any description. It is believed by the simple-minded peasantry to be the abode of demons and of the ghosts of hapless travelers who have perished in the endeavor to explore its perilous passes, and when storm and tempest sweep over the Fjeld, it is said that the shrieks of those lost ones may be distinctly heard amid the wailings of the wind. They tell also strange tales of hideous beings who dwell in the gloomy caves of these dark mountains, and entice men to destruction in their subterranean abodes, and of houses and farms seen amid those dreary wastes, which, like the mirage of the desert, vanish upon nearer approach. Relics of such superstitions, engendered by the fancies with which the wild and solitary scenes of their native mountains and forests deeply imbued the imaginations of the old Northmen, still linger among the Norwegian peasants. 
               Harcourt and Staynor had not journeyed even to the barriers of the Tessungdal; but had contented themselves with exploring the mountain passes in the region of the Rjukan Foss and the Folgefond-the most lofty peak of which is within an easy day's journey of the foot of the Hardanger Fjeld. 
               The two fishermen who accompanied Hans and Louise, had been of the party who had gone from the hamlet after Rolf's return, in search of Staynor, Harcourt, and Erik, consequently their knowledge of the most direct path to the place where they had fallen in with Staynor and his guide was of great benefit to Hans and Louise, and probably saved them many miles of weary travel. 
               It was late when the party set forth from the village, and darkness came on before they had accomplished the ascent to the nearest plateau; but they had provided themselves with the materials necessary to erect a tent, beneath which they could find shelter during the night; and spreading their canvas, they made with their heavy seal-skin coats what, under the circumstances, was a comfortable bed for Louise, and betook themselves to rest till daylight. At an early hour in the morning they pursued their journey, and reached in two hours the sloping plateau, described by Staynor and Erik as having afforded proof that a deadly struggle had taken place upon it. These marks were still visible; and while passing over the slope, Hans, to his great delight, picked up three or four specie dollars amid the grass. This satisfied the honest fellow that robbery had not been the object of Rolf. Louise also expressed her satisfaction, not that she for a single moment had suspected Rolf; but this she felt would be convincing evidence in his favor in the minds of others. 
               The highest peak of the Folgefond was now not far distant, and the precipice from which Rolf had said that Harcourt had fallen, towered, almost perpendicularly, above their heads. They advanced cautiously to the ridge of the sloping plateau, and looking over into the dark lake beneath, shuddered as they saw, still hanging to the projecting branch of a stunted shrub, half way down the steep descent, and fluttering in the breeze, the coat of the unfortunate Englishman. Their next procedure was to descend by a circuitous route to the depth of the valley beneath them, and, owing to the difficulty of the pass, and the number of loose stones which they dislodged in their descent, it was a tedious and dangerous undertaking; but in the course of half an hour they reached the level of the valley. It now remained to them to follow a path round the base of the mountain to its opposide side, in making which circuit they had to ascend several elevations, one of which was almost equal in altitude to the plateau from which they had descended. This occupied them nearly three hours; but their toil and fatigue was rewarded, when, at length, on reaching the borders of the lake which they had seen from the elevation of the plateau, they came in sight of the hut described to Louise by Erik. 
               They soon reached the wretched shanty, but, to their great consternation, found that it was deserted, although the presence of two or three cows, and some dozen goats, grazing amid the pasture of the valley, betokened the near neighborhood of their owner. 
               The men set up a loud shout, in the hope of attracting the attention of the owner of the hut; but for some time without any effect. At length the figure of a man appeared, who had emerged from a pine forest a few hundred yards distant. He gazed at the party for a few moments, and then advanced toward them in response to their invitation and the beckoning of their hands; but he was still distant a hundred yards, when he apparently became alarmed, and turning about, fled in the direction of the forest. 
               They followed in pursuit, but the fugitive soon plunged into the depths of the forest, and was lost to them. 
               A consultation was now held by the party, who found it difficult to account for the terror of the mountaineer, and all agreed that to search for him in the forest would be useless, if he chose to conceal himself; and if there was, as they suspected, another and a more commodious hut somewhere near, it might occupy hours or even days to discover it. Louise, however, recollected what Erik had intimated in relation to the fears with which he had inspired the simple-minded mountaineer, who, she suspected, had taken alarm at the sight of the party, imagining they had come to arrest him. This she explained to her companions, and offered to go forward alone. 
               "He will not be frightened of a woman," she said, "and I will explain the object of your visit." 
               Hans objected to this, and expressed his fears for her safety if she penetrated into the forest alone. 
               "It is for a good purpose that I shall venture," was her reply. "I have no fear. No one will do me harm. I will not venture out of the sound of your voices, and will call to you if I want assistance. Perhaps, good Hans, the impression upon my mind that my presence in the party would be essential to our success, when I was urged to stay behind at Kongshun, was not mere fancy." 
                
               Her companions, after some further useless expostulation, gave their consent to her proposition, and alone she entered the dark forest. She was absent half an hour, and Hans and the villagers, alarmed for her safety, were on the point of separating and scouring the forest in different directions, when they heard the sound of her voice calling to them, as if desirous to learn in which direction to approach. 
               They shouted in reply, and in a few minutes she appeared, in company with the mountaineer. 
               Her face was radiant with delight, as she advanced toward them. 
               "Herr Harcourt is living," she said, "and is recovering from the effects of his accident. He is in the cabin of this honest man, near by, and to which he will conduct us." 
               She then explained to Hans that she had penetrated perhaps a quarter of a mile into the forest, calling aloud, but in a gentle tone of voice, for Herr Harcourt; but for a long time she received no response to her call. She had almost begun to despair of success, when she saw the mountaineer, who afterward stated that he had watched her, unseen himself, from the moment she had plunged into the forest. He had, as she had suspected, been seized with a vague fear that the party had been sent to arrest him; but knowing that the stranger whom he had succored was living, and seeing a young woman alone, he had become ashamed of his fears, and advanced to meet her. A short conversation had satisfied him as to the object of the party in penetrating into his mountain solitude, and he had expressed his willingness to conduct her and her companions to his abode. 
               A few minutes' walk along the confines of the forest carried them thither, and as they drew near they saw the young Englishman sitting at the door of the hut. 
               Harcourt readily recognized Louise and Hans, and was overjoyed to see them, and doubly rejoiced when he learned from the former the cause which had induced her to undertake the toilsome and hazardous journey. He was rapidly recovering, but was still unable to walk without assistance, and although he spoke in the most grateful terms of the kindness and attentions he had met with from the goat-herd and his wife, and of the skill of the latter in the use of the medicinal herbs which, used externally and internally, had rapidly accelerated his recovery, he explained that he had been most awkwardly situated, in consequence of his utter inability to converse with his kind hosts, he not understanding a word of their rude mountain dialect, and they being completely ignorant of any other language. 
               Louise was nervously anxious that they should return to Bergen with all possible speed, and it was soon arranged that the mountaineer should accompany them, the honest fellow being promised a liberal reward for his humanity when he arrived at Bergen. 
               Perfectly acquainted with every pass among the mountains as was the cow-herd, the return journey-notwithstanding Harcourt had to be borne on a litter, hastily constructed of fir branches, for the greater part of the way-did not occupy so much time as Louise feared it would. A rude skiff belonging to their guide conveyed them across the lake, and saved them the toil and trouble of again making the circuit of the Folgefond and ascending to the plateau; the other ascents which they were compelled to make, were comparatively easy, and notwithstanding they passed the night at the cow-herd's hut, they reached Kongshun on the evening of Thursday, having been absent on their mountain journey little over forty-eight hours. 
               The following morning Hans, Louise, Harcourt and the mountaineer embarked on board the sloop, amid loud congratulations and good wishes for their future success from the villagers. 
               The passage up the Fjord was not accomplished with the rapidity of the passage from the mouth of the inlet to Kongshun. In several of the reaches the sloop was unable to lie her course, and much time was lost in tacking; and in others, where the bold shores-rising to the height of several hundred feet, and thickly clothed with deep woods of pine-overhung the water, the little vessel was sometimes almost becalmed. Two days and nights elapsed ere they reached the mouth of the Fjord. 
               Thence to Bergen the wind was foul and the weather tempestuous; and, as the reader is aware, it was not until late on the following Monday, the last day of the session, that the sloop reached port; and the little party-two stout porters having been hired to convey Harcourt from the wharf to the courthouse-only reached the latter place a short time before the close of the court, and while the Baron Von Welden was in the act of pronouncing sentence upon Rolf Frode. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXIII. 
               FATHER AND DAUGHTER. 
               "IT was, indeed, a most difficult task to control my feelings," said the Baron Von Welden to the pastor, as they sat at breakfast the day following that on which the exciting events had occurred which we narrated in a preceding chapter; "once or twice I was on the point of descending from the bench and clasping my noble girl to my bosom, and acknowledging her in the presence of the court and spectators." 
               "Had I been in your place, Herr Baron," replied the clergyman, "I don't think I could have restrained myself. Yes-I'm afraid I should have made myself appear very ridiculous." 
               "It is now nearly nine o'clock," observed the baron, looking at his watch; "Carl is to be here at ten o'clock with Louise." 
               "Yes," replied the pastor, "I told him to call at that hour and to bring Louise with him to meet me. Poor, dear girl! She little imagines the happy surprise which awaits her. It will greatly distress old Jansen and his wife, though; poor old couple! They are so much attached to the child, baron." 
               "They need not be separated from her," replied the baron. "The care they have bestowed upon Louise for so many years must not be thus requited. No-no. I will give them a cottage and garden near the chteau, and they shall see Louise every day. Carl, too, must be rewarded, good, honest fellow!" 
               "And Rolf Frode, baron?" said the pastor, interrogatively, and somewhat doubtingly. 
               "Rolf Welden, pastor," said the baron; "he, as well as his sister, shall take my name. Yes, Rolf and Hilda shall immediately take possession of the estate at Christiania, and I will settle upon them the back-rents since the period of my cousin Ulrica's death." 
               The pastor did not appear satisfied with this reply. He was about to make some other remark; but he hesitated, as if fearful of annoying or offending his patron, and after sitting in silence for some time he observed, 
               "Rolf and his sister will be as greatly surprised as Louise herself, when they are informed of the secret of their birth, and that they are not the children of a humble fisherman, as they have hitherto believed themselves to be." 
               "Yes," replied the baron, "the Swensens are a good family. The name is a good one, and Captain Swensen, the father of Rolf and Hilda, was a brave and excellent officer, as I have heard, though I had not the pleasure of his acquaintance. That he died poor, was no disgrace to him. My own father was poor enough. I don't know, pastor, whether Rolf had not better take his father's name, which is the name, indeed, that he is perfectly entitled to." 
               "Only," replied the pastor, determined to come to the point at once, and risk all hazards, "only, Herr Baron, in case-that is to say, should he-in fact, should you give your consent to your daughter's marriage, if Rolf took your name, it might be more agreeable to you." 
               The baron's countenance fell; and he did not immediately reply. At length he said, 
               "It would be hard to give my child into the keeping of another, Herr Pastor, immediately after I have recovered her. The wonderful change in the future prospects of these young people may possibly lead to a change in the feelings they entertain toward each other. We shall see." 
               The pastor was little better satisfied with this reply. He perceived that the baron was not disposed, willingly, to consent to the marriage of Rolf and Louise; yet he was inclined to believe, from his knowledge of the disposition of the latter, that Louise Von Welden would prove as honest, as simple-minded, and as true-hearted, as Louise Sigvald. However, he pressed the point no further, although he could not help thinking, "what a blight to the best feelings of our nature is this family pride!" 
               The baron began to grow impatient for the arrival of Carl Jansen with his daughter, and he rose from his chair and paced up and down the room, apparently too much agitated to continue the conversation. 
               The clergyman, also, felt a trifle nervous, and began to wish that the delicate task he had taken in hand was completed. 
               Presently a knock was heard at the street door. The baron sat down on the sofa; his pale face flushed, and his frame trembled with agitation. 
               A servant appeared, and announced that the man who had called a few days before was waiting in the hall, with a young woman. He wished to see Herr Bredell. 
               "Show them into the parlor," said the baron, striving to conceal his agitation from the servant, who, upon receiving this order, left the room, followed by the clergyman. 
               When the clergyman entered the parlor, Louise sprung from her seat, and, with tears in her eyes, attempted to utter some words expressive of her delight at meeting him; but the effort was too much for her. The excitement under which she had labored for several weeks, and the fatigue she had undergone, had overtaxed her mind and body; even the happy result of her last effort in Rolf's behalf only served more speedily to bring about the re-action, and she looked so feeble and so unwell that the clergyman feared that she was not in a fit state to listen to the exciting tale he had to tell. 
               He took her hand in his, and leading her to a sofa requested her to sit down, and at the same whispered to Carl to leave the room. 
               "Louise, my child," said he, when Carl had closed the door behind him, "I wish to speak to you in private. Do you feel strong enough to listen to some news-some good news?" he added, for the young girl looked at him in alarm, as if she feared that some fresh misfortune was about to befall her. 
               "Some good news," she murmured, and for a moment her face brightened. Carl Jansen had brought her to meet the pastor at the request of the latter. It was Carl who had originally cast a gloom over the prospects of Rolf and herself. "Perhaps," she thought, "Herr Bredell has sent for me to tell me that there no longer exists any impediment to my marriage with Rolf," and accustomed at all times to express her thoughts, she said, "Does it relate to Rolf?" Herr Bredell. 
               "No, my dear child," replied the pastor; "and yet," he added, "it does relate to Rolf and to Hilda as well as to you; but it is respecting yourself that I am now about to speak. You will promise me that you will be calm; that you will not become excited; but will listen patiently and quietly to what I am about to say, and will answer such questions as I may put to you?" 
               The nervous trepidation of the worthy pastor, and the very method he took to allay the fears of his youthful companion, were alike calculated rather to feed than to calm her excitement; but she replied, "Yes, Herr Pastor, I will do as you ask me." 
               "Mind, Louise," said the clergyman. "It is good news-the very best news I could possibly bring you-that I have to tell. Now, my dear, show me that locket you wear round your neck. You know you once showed it me when you were a little girl at Sartaroe." 
               Louise took the trinket from her bosom and placed it in the clergyman's hand. 
               He examined it closely for a moment, and then looking at his young companion, said, 
               "This does not in the least resemble you, Louise. Have you any recollection how it came into your possession?" 
                
               "No, Herr Pastor," answered the girl, with a smile. "Since they tell me I have worn it from my childhood, how can I recollect?" 
               "Truly it is of fine gold, and of rich workmanship," said the clergyman, examining, admiringly, the case of the locket; then again addressing the girl, who stood by, in great wonder at the interest the pastor had expressed in an ornament, the beauty of which, having been long accustomed to it, she little regarded, he said, 
               "You never saw either your father or your mother, Louise?" 
               "No, Herr Pastor; but mother Margaret-"the appellation by which the maiden was often accustomed to designate her supposed grandmother-"dear old mother Margaret has been all that a mother could have been to me." 
               "But your father, Louise? Would you not be glad if your father were still living?" 
               "O yes, Herr Pastor," answered the maiden; "but he has been dead many, so many years. You know he was drowned at sea, at the time when I was born." 
               "He was shipwrecked; but what if he was not drowned, Louise?" said the clergyman. "What if he be still living?" 
               The pallor of death overspread the fair features of the girl, and her voice trembled as she replied-having remarked that the clergyman was speaking in earnest, 
               "Is it so, Herr Pastor? You would not speak to me thus without a cause. O tell me. Can it be true that my father is living?" 
               "It is true, Louise, and he is not far from you at this moment." 
               "O take me to him, then. Let me see him; let me be sure that I, like my happier companions, have a father living. 
               "You shall see him to-day, Louise; nay, you shall see him in a few minutes. It was to tell you this good news that I sent for you." 
                
               "God bless you, Herr Pastor," said the young girl, in the emotion of the moment throwing her arms around the neck of the clergyman, whom, from childhood, she had been accustomed to regard with equal love and reverence, and sobbing on his shoulder; but presently recovering herself and blushing with confusion as she thought of the liberty into which she had been betrayed by her emotion, she said, 
               "But why has my father been absent for so many years? Why has he never let father Christian know that he was alive? Perhaps he has forgotten me; forgotten us all?" 
               "He has never ceased to think of you, Louise," said the clergyman. "He has always mourned you as one dead. It is only within these few days past that he has been made aware of your existence. He is ready to receive you and to lavish upon you the pent up affection of years." 
               "Let us go to him, Herr Pastor," said the young girl. "O how glad will grandfather and grandmother be to hear that my father is living. And, now, shall we all live together? O, Herr Pastor, take me to my father at once. Is he far away from here?" 
               "He is in this house, Louise. You shall see him in a few moments; but give me that miniature again, and sit down on the sofa and endeavor to compose yourself. I will return directly," and he left the apartment, taking the miniature with him. 
               The baron was pacing the floor of his private sitting-room when the clergyman entered, with the miniature in his hand. 
               He passed it to the baron, who took it from him with a trembling hand. 
               "God of heaven! how wonderful are thy ways!" he exclaimed, gazing upon the portrait with tearful eyes. "Herr Pastor, this is, indeed, the veritable miniature which, with my own hands, I, twenty years ago, placed round the neck of my poor, lost Mary! You have seen the portrait in the gallery at the chteau, which I had removed from my residence in Paris, after my return to Memel. Is not the resemblance between that portrait and this miniature perfect?" 
               "It is, indeed," said the clergyman. 
               "But, my child, Herr Bredell: where is my child?" continued the baron. "Have you told her? Does she know all? Why do you not bring me my child?" 
               "I have, Herr Baron, told her that her father is living and is now in this house, waiting to clasp her to his bosom; but I thought you would like to see the miniature. I have not told her the rank and position of her father. I go now, Herr Baron, to conduct your daughter to your presence." 
               A thousand conflicting thoughts agitated Louise, when the clergyman had left her alone in the room. She could scarcely conceive that she was not dreaming. Could it be possible that her father was living? If so, how could he have remained for so many years ignorant of her existence? or how had the pastor discovered him? How glad would Christian and Margaret Jansen be when they heard that the husband of their dearly-loved daughter was restored to them! But what if it was all a dream? So many strange things had happened of late! She passed her hand over her brow, and pinched her arm to ascertain if she were awake. Her father alive, and in this house! This house, so richly furnished, so much grander than any house she ever entered before! Could it be possible that this was her father's house? 
               It was with a mingled sensation of wonder, joy, and dread that she listened to the footsteps of the clergyman descending the stairs on his return from his interview with the baron. 
               "Come with me, my child," said the pastor, as taking the maiden by the hand, he led her from the room, "your father is waiting up stairs to receive you. Nay, do not tremble so. Your pulse is fluttering like that of a frightened bird." 
               Thus endeavoring to restore confidence to the agitated girl, the pastor led her up stairs. 
               The baron had laid aside the miniature, and having seated himself in his easy chair, had made up his mind to receive his child calmly, and without giving way to feelings which would compromise, in the presence of the clergyman, the dignity of demeanor in which he prided himself. He replied to the pastor's tap at the door of the apartment, with a quiet "Come in," and when Louise and the clergyman entered he requested them to be seated, without ever casting a glance toward them. 
               "Louise," he said, "I have learned-"He stayed his voice, unable to proceed with the formal speech he had arranged. Raising his eyes they encountered the wondering, bashful, half-frighted gaze of the maiden, who immediately on entering the room had recognized the judge who had sat in judgment upon Rolf. The next moment he rose from his seat, and stepping rapidly toward the trembling girl, he clasped her to his breast, while he murmured in broken accents, 
               "My daughter, my long-lost daughter! Child of my beloved Mary! Oh God grant that the angel in heaven may witness this meeting of her husband and child!" 
               Tears coursed down his pale cheeks as he raised his streaming eyes to heaven. 
                     "A touch of nature makes the whole world kin,"
                   and the pride and dignity of the baron and the judge succumbed to the long pent-up affections of the father. 
               Meanwhile Herr Bredell had quitted the room, leaving the baron and his daughter together, and had rejoined Carl Jansen in the parlor. The pastor was greatly agitated by the affecting scene he had witnessed, and the honest pilot was scarcely less disturbed. 
               "The Baron Von Welden," said the clergyman, when, after making several ineffectual efforts to speak, he at length found his voice, "will be lastingly indebted to you, Carl; but, though Christian, and Margaret, and Rolf will be rejoiced at Louise's good fortune, I doubt whether they would not have been better pleased if she had found a father of less exalted rank. You have mentioned nothing of this matter to any person yet, my good friend?" 
               "I did but mention it to Rolf, last night," said Carl; "but I bound him to secrecy." 
               "Ah! you did wrong, Carl. Not that it is of much consequence, since all will soon be known." 
               "Poor Rolf," said Carl, in exculpation of himself, "was so much cast down, notwithstanding his happy deliverance, at the thought that Louise had accompanied Hans Petersen to the Hardanger Fjeld to find the Herr Harcourt, and thus save him from the penalty of a crime of which he was guiltless, that I told him that he must learn to forget Louise, except as a sister. I then told him that'Louise was the daughter of the Baron Von Welden, and that she would be acknowledged by the baron to-day, and that I had every reason to believe that he, himself, was the illegitimate son of the baron, and consequently Louise's half brother." 
               "You told him this by way of comforting him in his tribulation," said the pastor, smiling as he spoke. "Of a verity, honest Carl, thou art one of Job's comforters. No doubt thy words tended greatly to raise the poor lad's spirits. But to speak plainly, good Carl, you spoke mistakingly to the youth. He and his sister Hilda bear no relationship to the baron, who has explained every thing to me; but it matters little, since the baron will soon see Rolf, and then, I trust, his mourning will be turned into joy. Has Rolf seen Louise?" 
               "No, Herr Pastor. I took him home with me from the court-house. He said he could not trust himself to see Louise or his friends; though he desired me to thank her for the interest she had taken in his behalf." 
               "And is he now at your lodgings?" 
               "He will be there, doubtless, when I return; but he wandered abroad at an early hour this morning, and did not return to breakfast." 
               "Then when you meet him, good Carl, prithee disabuse his mind of the false impression with which you have charged it, and prepare him to meet the baron, and to listen to some good news, which will materially improve his condition. There is no impediment of blood to his marriage with Louise, and it is but just that he call upon her, and personally thank her for the courage and generosity she has exerted for his sake; but, there is the baron's bell, which summons me to his room. Wait here, Carl, until I return." 
               When the clergyman re-entered the baron's room, he found the latter still seated on the sofa where he had left him. His daughter was seated by his side, and one of her hands was clasped in that of her father. Traces of tears were still visible on her face, but the expression of doubt and fear which had rested on her features was exchanged for one of joy and gratitude. 
               The baron himself had recovered his wonted composure, though his countenance, usually stern and grave, almost to melancholy, now wore the softened expression of parental love as he gazed fondly into his daughter's face. 
               "Be seated, Herr Pastor," said he; "I have briefly explained to my little Louise how it came about that her father so long believed her to be dead, and, though in finding a father she has lost other dear relations, I trust I have satisfied her that she shall keep all her own old friends, and that they shall become my friends likewise. I can not part yet with my newly-found treasure, so I am going to saddle you, my dear pastor, with an additional task. Will you direct Carl Jansen, the honest pilot down stairs, to go to the lodgings of Christian Jansen, and bring the old man and his wife, and Rolf and his sister, here. He can explain to them the reason why I have summoned them, and when they arrive we will talk matters over together. My darling tells me she has not seen Rolf since she left the court-room, after appearing so opportunely with Harcourt. The young scamp! he ought to have flown to her the moment he was released from durance, if he possess a spark of gratitude." 
                
               "He probably had his reasons, Herr Baron," replied the clergyman. "I understand from Carl that the latter informed Rolf of the relationship which exists between Louise and yourself." 
               The clergyman looked significantly at the baron as he spoke. 
               The latter understood the look. 
               "Carl should have been more wary," he said; "but it can not be helped. Bid him now inform Rolf that I know all about the connection between him and my daughter. You know, Herr Bredell, we were speaking on that subject this morning. Swensen is a very good name, Herr Bredell, and, as I observed, Rolf's father was a brave and gallant officer." 
               The pastor quitted the room to perform his errand, and Carl was soon on his way to Christian Jansen's lodgings, and shortly afterward the clergyman left the house. 
               The hours of the day flew swiftly away, while the Baron Von Welden and his daughter sat talking together. 
               The natural reserve which at first kept Louise silent and bashful in the presence of a newly-discovered father-so exalted in rank, and so dignified in position as was the baron-began to give way beneath the kindly tones of his voice and the affection betrayed in his glance; and in the course of a few hours she artlessly related to him the sum of her joys and troubles, her hopes and her fears, and the confidence she reposed in him, to judge from the pleased expression of his countenance, had not been bestowed in vain. 
               The shades of evening drew near, and found the father and daughter still in conversation, though now somewhat anxiously expecting the arrival of Christian Jansen and the others of whom Carl had gone in search. 
               At length the sound of voices was heard below stairs, and a servant announced the arrival of the pastor and a party of strangers. The baron ordered them to be shown up stairs, and in a few moments the Reverend Mr. Bredell entered the room, accompanied by Christian and Margaret Jansen, and Hilda Welden. 
               Louise sprang from her father's side to meet and welcome her friend Hilda and the old couple who had for so many years guided her childhood, and believed themselves to be her nearest relatives. 
               It was singular, and yet perfectly natural to note the mingled embarrassment and fondness which sat upon the countenances of old Jansen and his wife, as they returned the embraces of Louise. They could scarcely realize the fact that she whom they had learned to love when an infant, and whom they believed to be their grandchild, was the daughter of the Baron Von Welden. They had never before stood in so high a presence, and they shrunk abashed, within themselves, as soon as Louise had disengaged herself from their first fond embrace. She had, however, scarcely resumed her seat beside her father, when Margaret Jansen-forgetting the presence of the baron; forgetting the awe with which the, in her opinion, surpassing magnificence of the apartment into which she had been introduced, had inspired her; forgetting every thing but that-as she fancied-the child she had loved so long and so dearly, was about to be removed from her, perhaps forever-rushed forward, and throwing her shriveled arms round the maiden's neck, while the tears she was unable to restrain streamed down her furrowed cheeks, cried aloud, 
               "Louise, my child-my daughter-since God has taken my own Louise to himself, you can not, will not forsake me. This is false. Tell me, my love; tell the baron, that you are my child; that you will not forsake the hearthstone by which you have sat since you were a wean, for his rich castle, with all its magnificence and grandeur. Oh, the Herr Baron is rich and great, and folks say that he is good. Why then does he seek to rob me of my child?" 
               "He does not, good mother," said the baron, rising from his seat-much affected by the distress of the old lady-and taking ing her hand. "He does not; Louise has found a father; but those who cherished her in childhood, and who enacted the part of parents toward her, will never be forgotten by her, nor by me. My daughter shall still be your grandchild, Margaret Jansen." 
               Christian Jansen and Hilda, assisted by the pastor, used their best endeavors to console the poor old lady, and at length in some measure succeeded; and quiet having been restored, inquiry was made by the baron after Carl Jansen and Rolf. 
               "Rolf can not be found," said the pastor, in response to the baron's inquiry, and the eager, inquiring glance of Louise. "He left Carl's lodgings before sunrise this morning, and has not since returned. It appears that he did not retire to bed last night, although he must have been thoroughly worn out with fatigue after the excitement of yesterday. Carl has now gone to the house of Madame Sontum, where the Herren Harcourt and Staynor reside, to learn whether Rolf has called upon them. It is likely that such is the case," he continued, noticing the distress apparent in the countenance of Louise. "We shall soon learn. Carl will be here presently." 
               The pastor had scarcely spoken before Carl arrived and was shown up stairs and into the room occupied by the party. 
               The anxious expression of his features betrayed his disappointment before he replied to the eager questions which were put to him. 
               "I have not seen Rolf," he said, at length. "He called early this morning upon Herr Harcourt, and told him that he was going to leave Bergen, not to return. He left this letter for Herr Harcourt, to deliver to Louise." 
               Louise opened the letter which Carl placed in her hands, and commenced to read its contents; but her hands trembled and her face grew pale, and she was unable to accomplish the task of reading it to the end. She placed the letter in the hands of the baron, and covering her face with her apron, sobbed forth, 
               "Oh, Rolf, Rolf, this is cruel! It was for your sake; to save you from shame: to prove your innocence, that I went to the Hardanger Fjeld with Hans Petersen. It is cruel to blame me thus." 
               The baron perused the letter with some difficulty, for although Rolf had received an education superior to the generality of the class among whom his lot had been cast, the letter had evidently been penned while the writer was in a state of great excitement, and was scarcely legible. Its contents were as follows: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "BERGEN, August 21, 18- 
                              "DEAREST LOUISE:
                            
                           "Ere you receive this I shall have quitted Bergen. Try to forget me, if you have not already done so. I, too, shall strive to forget the past; but I fear it will be beyond my power to do so. 
                           "I have heard from Carl of the change in your fortune. May you be happy-happier than I could have made you, though my life's effort would have been to make you happy. 
                           "You, ere you have read this, will have learned that there exists an impediment to our marriage which can not be surmounted, even if you requited my ill-starred affection. Yet why should I blame you? You have proved your sisterly affection by having undertaken the dangerous journey to the Hardanger Fjeld with Hans Petersen in order to prove my innocence. May Hans be happier than I can ever be." 
                         
                      
                  
                
               Louise had read thus far, when unable to finish the perusal of the letter, she had placed it in the hands of the baron. 
               The latter continued its perusal as follows: 
               "Yet can even this be? Will Louise Von Welden still think of those whom, as Louise Sigvald, she esteemed and loved? or will not she rather forget the friends of her childhood? 
               "On me a double share of misery has fallen. I learn that I am not even the son of honest Carl Frode, the fisherman; but an outcast-one whom society disowns, and, although innocent, universally condemns. 
                
               "I leave you, dear Louise, to your newly-found happiness. Much I wish to see you-to speak one word to you before I quit this country; but I can not trust myself with an interview. 
               "At noon, to-day, I leave Bergen on board an English ship bound to Hull. Thence I shall endeavor to find a ship bound to America, which I shall make my future home. 
               "Farewell. God bless you, Louise-and perhaps sometimes amid your happiness, when you think of days gone by-for such thoughts will intrude-you will remember Rolf, who has so dearly and so fatally loved you; and should you ever wish to hear of me, you can do so by seeking my poor sister Hilda, whom I leave behind; but for whom I shall send to join me, as soon as I am settled in America." 
               "Foolish, headstrong youth," said the baron when he had read the letter to the end. "You had better read the letter aloud, Herr Bredell, that his friends may hear," handing the letter to the clergyman, who read it aloud as requested. 
               Hilda gave way to the strongest manifestations of grief, and refused to listen to Margaret Jansen and the pastor, who sought to console her, by telling her that when Rolf wrote, as he had promised, she might so explain matters as to lead him to return home. Neither she, nor old Margaret, nor even Louise, could understand the full meaning of the letter. To the pastor, however, as well as to the baron, it was plain enough. 
               "Ah!" said the former, reproachfully, to Carl, "you should have remained silent; this is your doing." 
               Poor Carl was almost beside himself with grief, and thus the day which promised so happily, closed in gloom and sorrow. Old Jansen and his wife, and Hilda and Carl, soon left for their own lodgings, the baron having postponed, until a more favorable opportunity, the explanation he had intended to give Rolf and Hilda; and Louise, dejected by the news she had heard from Rolf, and worn out by the excitement of the day, following so closely on the excitements of a different description which she had latterly experienced, retired to an apartment which had been prepared for her in her newly-found father's mansion. 
               The baron and the pastor sat up, occupied in earnest conversation, until a late hour. 
               "The young man has acted foolishly, urged by headstrong passion," observed the former, as he and his friend rose to retire, some time after midnight. "Yet, I don't know but that all this is for the best. I will see Hilda to-morrow, and will explain the position of her brother's affairs to her, and see that she and her children are provided for; and she and I can both write to Rolf, as soon as we know where to direct our letters, and urge his return. Time and absence may cure this somewhat unfitting attachment between the youth and Louise. I promised to-day to let Louise act as she pleases in relation to her affections; but you will acknowledge, Herr Bredell, that a marriage between the daughter of the Baron Von Welden and a young man who, whatever his good qualities, and howsoever respectable his descent, has been educated as a fisherman, and has earned his livelihood in that humble capacity, would be scarcely creditable." 
               The pastor thought that the marriage of the supposed poor fisherman, with the supposed daughter of a deceased pilot, would be creditable enough, although both were now advanced to a higher position in society; but he made no reply, and bidding the baron "good-night," retired to his bed-chamber. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXIV. 
               BROTHER AND SISTER. 
               WE must now return to the villa of Mr. John Templeton and to its inmates, of whom, for some time past, we have lost sight; but it must be remembered that although we have occupied several chapters in detailing the stirring events and incidents which befell Henry Harcourt and others subsequent to the departure of the former from Sartaroe, we have related only the occurrences of a few weeks, occupying scarcely more time in their action than it has occupied to narrate them. 
               We left the family at Templeton Villa, overwhelmed with grief, after having heard of the shipwreck and supposed death, by drowning, of Henry Harcourt. Mr. Templeton had written to the banker at Hamburg who had furnished him with the account of his nephew's loss in the ship Jung Frau, and had requested the banker to transmit to him, as his late nephew's guardian, all moneys or other property which had belonged to the unfortunate young gentleman which he, the banker, might hold in trust; but mails were slow and uncertain in the days of which we write, and the banker only received the letter at the date of the events recorded in a preceding chapter, consequently Mr. Templeton, and Mrs. Harcourt, and Alice still remained in ignorance of the fact that Henry had been rescued from a watery grave. 
               At the period when the present chapter opens, the family at Templeton Villa were in deep mourning. Mrs. Harcourt had manifested the most profound affliction on hearing of her son's death, for, although her daughter Alice was her favorite child, and she professed in moments of spleen to care little for the son, who had, in fact, been almost from childhood an alien to his mother's house, she had really been both proud and fond of Henry; besides, he it was upon whom the honors of the family had been expected to descend; to him she had hoped to look for comfort and protection in her declining years; she had been wont to pride herself in the belief that the fortunes of the Harcourts would, in his person, be restored to their pristine splendor; in him-but why pursue the theme further? Mrs. Harcourt was a mother, and he whose death she mourned had been her only son. 
               Alice, also, sincerely sorrowed for the loss of her brother, whom she had loved with all a sister's fondest devotion. Henry had been her idol, and the very fact that his visits to his mother's house had been few and far between, and brief in duration, had caused her to look forward to those visits the more eagerly, and to cherish them more dearly. 
               And Mr. John Templeton, notwithstanding he had grumbled at his nephew's improvidence, and at his careless, reckless habits, and had been accustomed to lament his utter deficiency in that plodding sobriety of demeanor and devotion to business which had led to his own success in the world, had really loved the youth as his own son, and as such mourned his loss. It was for Henry's sake that he had exerted himself to restore the deeply mortgaged estate of William Harcourt to its original prosperity, and just when he began to flatter himself that he had got every thing into fair training, and that in another year or two his nephew would be enabled to take possession of the estate, freed from every debt and burden, the young man was suddenly removed to another world, where it little mattered to him whether the property of his father was freed from embarrassment or not. 
               In this regard, Mr. Templeton really felt himself to be an injured man. All his labor had been, in a measure, for naught. To be sure the estate would fall to Alice; but she, dearly as the old gentleman loved her, was but a girl, and in ill health. He had but one gleam of comfort in the midst of his affliction. In the event of his niece's death and the estate falling to his sister, he hoped that she, seeing the necessity of providing an heir to the property, would marry again, and so free him from the burden and annoyance of her society in his bachelor's retreat. 
               And among all the mourners none mourned more deeply or more sincerely than the old housekeeper, Mrs. Jenkins. She had nursed Henry when he was an infant. She had been to him a second mother in his childhood, after the unhappy separation of his parents, and she, as the reader will recollect, had always stood up stanchly in defense of her favorite when Mr. Templeton, in his ebullitions of temper, had spoken disparagingly of the youth. 
               The good old lady vowed to her friends-in confidence-that she believed Master Henry's death was a judgment upon the family, for the way in which they slighted him, and dear Miss Alice, who was as lovable a young creature for a girl, as was Master Henry for a boy, was not, herself, long for this world. Those who did not know the value of children almost deserved to be rendered childless. 
               Two months had elapsed since the news of the death of Henry Harcourt had been received at Templeton Villa, and the first keen edge of grief had worn off. The sad news had put a stop to the gayeties and festivities with which Mrs. Harcourt, greatly to the annoyance of her brother, sought to enliven the dullness which, in her opinion, pervaded country life, whether in the pleasant dales of England, or on the beautiful banks of the Hudson; but-so true is it that the best-loved and most deeply mourned are quickly forgotten-Mrs. Harcourt already began to seek and sigh for a change to enliven the monotony of the villa. 
               Already the servants of Mr. Templeton, who had experienced a temporary respite from the annoyances to which Mrs. Harcourt had subjected them, since she had heard of her son's death, had began to grumble anew at her exactions, and the widow Harcourt had recommenced her expostulations with her brother respecting the propriety of hiring or purchasing a mansion in the city and only retaining the villa as a country seat, and a pleasant retreat during a month or two of summer. 
               One day while engaged in conversation with her brother on this topic, the servant, who had been to the post-office in the neighboring village, brought back a packet of letters from Europe. 
               The London post-mark was upon the whole of them. Mr. Templeton expected, when he received the packet, to find one letter from Hamburg-hoping against hope that the news he had received from his nephew's banker might be false, and that the young man had embarked on board some other vessel than the Jung Frau, or that news had been received of his safety. Such was not the case; yet, under any other circumstances, the news would have been received with pleasure-as it was, it was satisfactory, although it seemed to rekindle the feelings of regret which he had experienced when he heard of his nephew's death. 
               The letters were from the gentleman whom he had intrusted to manage the encumbered estate of the late William Harcourt, Esq., of Harcourt Hall, and the attorneys and others by him employed, and these gentlemen wrote to inform their employer that the affairs of the estate were prospering far beyond their expectations, and that, to judge from the present aspect of things, the property would be free from all embarrassment in another year. 
               Mr. Templeton, after having read the letters, passed them over to his sister. 
               "Mr. John Templeton," said that lady, when, with the aid of her gold spectacles, she had read the letters from beginning to end, "no person has grieved so sorely as I for the death of my poor boy. He was my only son, and it is but natural that such should be the case." 
                
               "No one doubts it, Alice," observed Mr. Templeton, perceiving that the lady paused and awaited his reply. 
               "Yet, my dear John," said the lady, descending from the dignified formality with which she was accustomed to address her brother; "yet, my dear brother, it is sinful to grieve for the dead to such a degree as to forget what is due to the living. My tears can not recall poor Henry to life-"Mrs. Harcourt here raised her handkerchief to her eyes. "What I was about to say, John," she continued, after a pause, "is, that while I grieve for Henry, it is my duty to remember that I have another child whose interests I am, as a mother, in duty bound to look after." 
               "Very true, Alice," said Mr. Templeton, beginning to suspect the purport of his sister's remarks. 
               "I would ask, John," continued the lady, "what will be the probable rental of the Harcourt property, when entirely disencumbered, as the attorney writes it will be in the course of another year?" 
               "I can not say exactly, Alice," said Mr. Templeton, "so much depends upon the increase or depreciation in the value of the property. I should imagine from nine thousand to ten thousand pounds a year; under the most favorable circumstances fully ten thousand pounds-under any circumstances, the first-mentioned sum." 
               "And this will fall to Alice?" 
               "Undoubtedly, for lack of heirs male." 
               "And in case of dear Alice's death?" 
               "You, as the widow of Mr. William Harcourt, will be heir to the property, madam." 
               "Then, John, do you not think it advisable to take Alice more into society? The dear child has grieved so much for her brother, that I fear the effect of this grief upon her health. She is very feeble, John, and is very lonesome in this monotonous solitude. A visit to the city, and an introduction to the gayeties of New York, would serve to wean her from this constant brooding over her brother's loss, and I trust would have a beneficial effect upon her health. I do not speak for myself, John. I could be content to remain here in retirement; but my duty as a mother forbids me to regard my own wishes, when my daughter's health or interest are concerned." 
               Mr. Templeton was somewhat annoyed. He thought there was a want of feeling manifest in this desire to revel amid the gayeties of the city, while the first tears shed for the supposed death of Henry were scarcely dry. He answered testily, 
               "Yes, you can please yourself, Alice. I have nothing to say in the matter. If you choose to remove to New York, I shall say nothing to deter you from so doing; but, once for all, I assure you that I shall remain a resident of Templeton Villa." 
               "Ah! Mr. Templeton," said the lady, "you have no thought of dear Alice. You know nothing of the anxieties which haunt the mind of a parent, John." 
               "Thank heaven for that," thought Mr. Templeton; and he was about to give utterance to the thought, when he remembered his gentle niece, and checked himself. 
               "Mrs. Harcourt," he replied, "if I thought the health of Alice would be benefited by the change, I would remove to New York instantly. If I am not a parent, I have all a father's fondness for the dear child; but the gayeties of city life are not calculated, in my opinion, to bring back the roses to the cheeks of my niece; nor is the air of the city so pure and wholesome as that which she breathes every day in this place." 
               "It is not so much the salubrity of the air, Mr. Templeton," said the widow, "as the effect which the change would produce. You know Mrs. Withers, who resides in the cottage on the hill. Her eldest daughter pined away sadly last year; but Mrs. Withers removed to the city for a season, and she and her daughters returned this spring quite restored to health and cheerfulness." 
               "Humph!" exclaimed Mr. Templeton. "Mrs. Withers and her daughters are no criterion to Judge by, Mrs. Harcourt. Her husband made a tolerable good fortune through some successful stock speculations; she is a strong, masculine woman, who, in early life, moved in a very humble sphere; has little or no education, and having been brought up in the city, has no taste for the pleasures the country affords. Her elder daughters resemble the mother. They have traveled in Europe for years, and are yet unmarried, although I have heard that the mother actually forced them into the society of every young man she could meet with, whom she considered available. As to sickness, none of the family ever knew what a day's sickness was, to judge from their looks, except poor little Clara, the youngest daughter, who is the best and the prettiest, and the most delicate of the lot, and who, poor thing! is perpetually snubbed by her mother and sisters, in consequence of her retiring disposition. She was the only one who, so far as I could judge, experienced any change in health from the visit, and with her the change was not for the better. She came back this spring looking very poorly, and I perceive that she always dresses in black, while her sisters and mother flaunt in gay colors. This singular fancy of hers makes her look still more delicate than she would otherwise do." 
               Mr. Templeton had alluded to a peculiarity which, for the moment, led Mrs. Harcourt to forget the immediate subject of conversation. 
               "Clara Withers is a singular young woman, Mr. Templeton," she answered. "Did you observe that she did not assume her mourning attire until some time after her return from the city?" 
               "No, I can't say that I did. It seems to me that she was dressed in black the first time I met her this summer." 
               "It was not so, Mr. Templeton," said the widow. "Mrs. Withers called upon me for the purpose of making my acquaintance shortly after her return from New York, and very soon after I arrived here; and it was then she told me how much benefit she and her family, particularly her eldest daughter, had derived from their visit to the city." 
                
               "All nonsense!" grumbled Mr. Templeton. 
               "I can not say as for that," resumed the widow, "since I have only known the family for a short time. Still, though I countenance them-for poor Alice's sake-in this dull place, I can not say that I am prepossessed in favor of the family. Nor can I perceive what you see to admire in Clara, who seems to me to be the most disagreeable of the four daughters." 
               "Our tastes differ in this as in many other respects, Mrs. Harcourt," replied Mr. Templeton. The widow took no notice of this interruption, but proceeded to state that she had been, disgusted with the absurd pretension of Mrs. Withers the first time she met her. 
               "It is strange, then, that you continue to visit her, and to receive her visits," remarked Mr. Templeton. 
               "One must visit somebody, Mr. Templeton," said the widow; "besides it was Clara who first led me to look upon the family with aversion. I don't know but Mrs. Withers behaved very properly under the circumstances." 
               "Under what circumstances, Alice? For the life of me, I can't understand what you mean," said Mr. Templeton. 
               "If you will cease to interrupt me, John, I will explain; but explanation is out of the question when you insist upon interposing, what I must certainly style rude observations. 
               "I was saying that Mrs. Withers called at the villa shortly after I arrived from England. She said that she had known you ever since you had resided in this part of the country, and very politely expressed her delight at learning that I and Alice intended to make the villa our permanent residence. It had been a perfect hermitage, she said, before our arrival." 
               "A very polite observation on the part of the lady," said Mr. Templeton. "I wish to heaven it had remained a hermitage," he thought to himself. 
               Disregarding the interruption, Mrs. Harcourt continued, 
               "She informed me that she had returned some twelve months ago from a protracted tour in Europe, and in the course of conversation versation observed that she had met with a young gentleman in Florence, of the name of Harcourt. She described his appearance-poor Henry, you know, made several visits to Florence-and I soon discovered that it was he to whom she alluded; but I pretended not to recognize the description, and did not inform her that I had a son. 
               "She proceeded to state that this youth had become smitten by the charms of her youngest daughter, Clara, and that, believing him at that time to be a youth of good family, she had not discouraged his attentions to her daughter; but, subsequently, having learned that he was the son of a decayed gentleman, who had died deeply involved, and a mere fortune-hunter-some French acquaintance, a count something or other, had told her this-and having learned, also, that his principal acquaintance was a young man named Staynor, who, it was reported, had no visible means of living, yet who managed to figure in the best society the city afforded, she had discouraged the visits of this Mr. Harcourt, and had refused to permit her daughter to receive his letters. At length discovering that Clara still kept up a secret correspondence with the young man, she had intercepted his letters and returned them to him, unopened, and thus had managed to break off the affair. 
               "The young man, she continued, then left Italy, and, as she believed, went to England, but after an absence of some months returned to Florence, and, evidently, purposely put himself in the way of meeting her and her daughters; but she kept a vigilant eye upon Clara, and prevented any clandestine meeting between them. 
               "She concluded her long harangue by denouncing the host of fortune-hunters and swindlers who haunt the continent of Europe, and force themselves into good society-she might well have included the husband-hunters in her denunciations-and expressed her satisfaction at learning that the youth, though he bore the name of Harcourt, was no relation of mine!" 
               "Well, Alice," replied the old bachelor, "I have said that I don't admire Mrs. Withers; but I really can not perceive that she committed an unpardonable offense in relating her experience abroad. To be sure she had no right to brother you with her family matters; but if you were offended at what she said, you had yourself only to blame. You acted with duplicity in not acknowledging, in the first place, that it was your son of whom she was speaking." 
               "You have not heard the whole of the story, Mr. Templeton," resumed the widow. "Mrs. Withers continued to visit me, without, however, again boring me with the history of her experience in foreign travel. The girls called, also, and I tolerated them, because I thought their society would be company for Alice. 
               "Now, Mr. Templeton, mark the duplicity of your favorite, Clara Withers. She became, or pretended to become, very partial to dear Alice, and learning from her that she had a brother living, she soon discovered that it was he whom she had been forbidden to meet in Florence. She told this to Alice, in confidence, making her promise not to disclose the fact to me. Indeed, she showed Alice one or two letters which, unknown to her mother, she had retained, when Mrs. Withers had insisted upon all Henry's letters being returned to him. I knew nothing of this until after the news of poor Henry's death reached us. 
               "Then Mrs. Withers called to condole with me, and forgetting, as gossips are apt to do, what she had related to me but a few weeks previous, she actually repeated that she met Henry in Florence, and that he had paid attention to her daughter Clara; but she had discountenanced him, because, forsooth! she thought her daughter was too young to think of marrying, and she was not sufficiently satisfied of the young man's ability to support a wife! More than this, she had the impertinence to add that had she known what she now knows, she would have allowed the matter to proceed, and would have overlooked the youth of her daughter, and said, that if Henry had married Clara, he would have returned to England or come to America, and, in all probability, this sad accident would not have befallen him. What impudence, Mr. Templeton." 
               "I really can not see it in that light, Alice," said Mr. Templeton. 
               "Indeed, sir!" exclaimed the lady. "Can you see nothing improper in a person like Mrs. Withers seeking an alliance with our family!" 
               "Certainly not, Alice. If the expectations of poor Henry were such as to place him, pecuniarily, in a higher position than Mrs. Withers can pretend to, recollect that you and, I, Alice, were poor enough when I first came from the south to New York." 
               "Still we are descended from a good family, Mr. Templeton; and recollect my marriage into the Harcourt family." 
               "Which, assuredly is not a matter of congratulation," said Mr. Templeton. 
               "You choose to insult me, John," replied the widow; "but I have not yet told all. I noticed that Clara attired herself in mourning apparel, and inquired the reason. I was told that, against the wishes of her mother, she insisted upon so attiring herself, as she averred, out of respect for the memory of my poor boy, and that she had said, that since Henry was dead, she would never marry, although she has had one or two good offers, while her sisters have had none at all." 
               "I am not at all surprised to hear that the elder girls have had no offers," said Mr. Templeton, sarcastically; "and I like poor Clara all the better in consequence of what you have related to me concerning her." 
               "It is scandalous in her to remain a burden upon her mother, when she could have a household of her own," answered Mrs. Harcourt. "Mrs. Withers has enough to do to maintain four grown up daughters in the style in which she lives; and to think of Clara Withers acting as if she were really a member of the Harcourt family." 
               Mr. Templeton made no reply to this burst of indignation. He was wearied with the topic of conversation, and fell, or pretended to fall, asleep, and Mrs. Harcourt commenced to reperuse the letters, resolving to wait until her brother roused himself from his afternoon nap and then to resume her endeavors to persuade him to remove to New York, or at least to hire a temporary residence in the city. 
               In the course of half an hour the old gentleman awoke, and the lady immediately resumed the conversation at the point where it was broken off abruptly, in consequence of her indignation at what she chose to consider the impudence of Clara Withers. 
               "Then you will not listen to my earnest desire to reside in the city, for the benefit of dear Alice's health, Mr. Templeton?" commenced the lady, before the old bachelor had well opened his eyes. 
               "Mrs. Harcourt," replied Mr. Templeton, "I would willingly do any thing that would tend to benefit my niece, or," he mentally added, "to restore peace and quiet to Templeton Villa; but I will not quit my own home to reside in the dusty, noisy city, merely to gratify an idle whim. If you, however, think proper to go, I will place no obstacle in the way." 
               "It is very expensive, residing in the city, John." 
               "I am aware of that, Alice; but you have your own jointure; nearly two thousand five hundred dollars a year. Surely that sum might suffice, with economy, to support you and your daughter?" 
               "Brother John," replied the widow, "I am astonished to hear you speak of economy, when Alice, as you have just informed me, is presumptive heiress to ten thousand pounds a year. Two thousand five hundred dollars a year will not suffice, as you well know, to support my daughter and myself in New York in the style we shall be expected to live." 
               "Presumptive heiress! as you may well say, Alice," said Mr. Templeton, who was beginning to grow impatient. "But there is an old adage, sister, which reads, 'There is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip. If you wish to live in the city, go and do so at your own cost, and when you feel inclined to return to Templeton Villa-which, for my niece's sake. I hope will be soon, otherwise you may, for aught I care, remain in New York as long as you live-you will find a retreat in my house, which will be open to you as it has hitherto been." 
               Finding that all her eloquence was lost upon her brother, Mrs. Harcourt determined for once to have her own way, and although her means were limited in comparison with her ideas, she engaged apartments at a fashionable boarding-house in the city, and within a few days after the above conversation, left the villa, with her daughter Alice, to mingle in the bustle, and fashion, and frivolity of New York. 
               Here, for the present, we shall leave them, and return to the scene of the incidents narrated in former chapters. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXV. 
               THE CONVALESCENT. 
               SOME three weeks had elapsed since the return of Henry Harcourt from his involuntary retreat among the mountains of the Hardanger Fjeld, and the young gentleman in question was seated with his friend, Charles Staynor, in a comfortable apartment in the boarding-house of Madam Sontum, in the Strand Gaden. We have heretofore stated that there are no good hotels for the accommodation of travelers in Bergen, and Madam Sontum receives, or did receive, all of the better class. 
               Harcourt had nearly recovered from the effects of his accident, and, to all appearance, was as well as ever. The young men had just finished their breakfast, during which meal the conversation had related to their future proceedings. 
               "So you are resolved to return to England, Harry?" observed Staynor. 
               "I think it better to return," was Harcourt's reply. "You see, Charley, it is growing late in the season-August has passed, and we shall soon have cold weather upon us. I should like to accompany you overland to Christiania; but the travel is difficult, and, although I have pretty well recovered the use of my limbs, I should still make but sorry progress over the mountain roads between Bergen and the modern capital." 
               "Then I'll give up the idea of going to Christiania myself," replied Staynor, "and accompany you to England, if you are agreeable?" 
               "Nothing would please me better." 
               "Do you intend to remain in England?" 
                
               "That will be according to circumstances. I must visit my mother and sister. I have not, I fear, been a very dutiful son, nor a very devoted brother. Poor little Alice! She will be glad to see me. I hope neither she nor my mother have heard of the loss of the Jung Frau, or, at any rate, have not heard that I took passage on board that ill-fated vessel." 
               "It was wrong of you not to write," observed Staynor." 
               "Perhaps it was. I thought so sometimes while I was lying sick in the hut among the mountains. I felt that I had neglected my duty. Ah, Staynor, there is nothing like a sick bed to bring one to a sense of one's short-comings. They all pass before one in grave and terrible array, particularly when no familiar face is seen, and no familiar voice is heard to cheer one's spirits. The old goat-herd and his wife were kind, poor creatures; but they could not understand me, nor I them. I shall never forget how my heart bounded, and my pulses quickened with pleasure when I saw Hans and pretty little Louise approaching the hut." 
               "The pleasure was fully as great on my part, when I saw you borne into the court-house," replied Staynor: "but, do you intend to write home before you leave Bergen?" 
               "No, I think not, since I have delayed writing so long. After all, it is not likely that my friends have heard of the shipwreck, still less likely that they have any suspicion that I was on board the vessel. I have not been in the habit of making my whereabouts known to them, and they probably believe me to be in France or Germany." 
               "Or Florence," said Staynor, archly smiling at his friend. 
               "Nay, spare me the taunt, Charley," replied Harcourt. "I am cured of that fancy. I shall not visit Florence again, just yet." 
               "Nous verrons, mon ami; but supposing that you do not incline to remain in England?" 
               "In that case, I shall seek a new field for exploration. My uncle Templeton is in the United States. Whereabouts I don't know; but I can ascertain in London. I shall pay the old gentleman a visit. It will be but right. He has taken a great deal of trouble on my account, and I fear I have been somewhat ungrateful." 
               "The United States, eh? Let me think, is not the fair Florentine an American by birth?" said Staynor. 
               "Nonsense, Charley; as I have told you, that silly escapade is quite forgotten." 
               "Indeed! and yet there was a certain chest saved from the wreck which contained certain packets of long-treasured epistles in a certain fair lady's hand-writing; and that the contents of these letters are not wholly consigned to oblivion, proof was afforded me the other day, when, believing that you had lost your life on that unlucky trip to the Hardanger Fjeld, I set myself to work like a faithful friend to collect your effects, in order to transmit them, or carry them to your friends in England. While thus employed, I found a pocket-book beneath the pillow of your bed-left there by mistake, I presume. I opened it to examine the contents, and found them to be some half dozen letters, which I suspect, from the place where they were concealed, had served to beguile a weary hour before you retired, the last night we slept in this city, before starting for the mountains. These letters were in the hand-writing of Miss Withers." 
               "What did you do with them, Charley? I thought they were safe in my portmanteau." 
               "So they are now, my dear fellow; don't get excited. It will be hurtful in your present state of health. I placed them carefully away, and I give you my word of honor I didn't read their contents; but confess that you are fairly caught, Harry. What a famous piece of gossip there would have been for Madame Sontum's establishment, had it not been for my precaution. How romantic! A young English gentleman-handsome, of course, the story would have made you, in spite of your ugliness, you know-murdered by his guide among the mountains. Packet of love-letters found beneath the pillow in the bedroom he occupied before he set forth on the fatal journey and so forth." 
               "Cease your silly banter, Charley," said Harcourt, smiling at his friend. "One may retain possession of a bundle of old letters, without having any special object in so doing, I presume?" 
               "Oh, assuredly, Harry," said Staynor, "particularly if they chance to be love-letters." 
               "Nothing further has been heard of Rolf Frode, I suppose?" said Harcourt, changing the topic of conversation. "You go abroad every day, which I am unable to do." 
               "Nothing that I am aware of, Harry; the silly fellow went away to sea, as he said he should when he called upon you. It is said he was jealous of Hans Petersen, the young fellow who accompanied Louise to the Hardanger Fjeld." 
               "So I surmised when he called and asked me to lend him money on his boat, until it could be disposed of, since he no longer had any use for it. Well, he had reason. No man knows at what moment his mistress may prove false to him." 
               "Upon my word, Harry, you are too absurd. You are as bad as Rolf himself. The young girl ventures upon a perilous journey, solely on account of her devotion to her lover, who is charged with a fearful crime; and Rolf requites her by becoming ridiculously jealous, and actually runs away from her. You benefit almost in a like degree, for you are not only, through her heroism, brought from your involuntary abode among the mountains to the city, where you have that attention paid to you which you could not have otherwise received, and are thus speedily restored to health; but you are spared the pain you would have experienced had poor Rolf suffered, for ever so short a time, the penalty of a crime of which he was guntless, and you justify Rolf's conduct!" 
               "Had Rolf's position been mine," said Harcourt, "I would sooner have suffered than have owed my deliverance to the generosity of a successful rival." 
                
               "Stuff and nonsense!-a successful rival!" replied Staynor. "I don't believe any thing of the sort. Even poor Hans's generous motives are impugned. You deserve to have been left to your solitude in the mountains, and Rolf to have been sent to hard labor in the fortress. I have no patience with such folly. However, you have been cooped up within doors, and have got a fit of the spleen, for want of exercise. Our old friend, the Baron Von Welden, has gone back to his country-seat. We promised to visit him before we left Bergen. Suppose we take a jaunt to the chteau to-morrow. You are well enough now to bear the fatigue?" 
               "I am quite agreeable," replied Harcourt. 
               "That affair is settled, then. I will see about hiring a conveyance this afternoon. By the way, suppose we should meet Louise at the chteau. There is an odd rumor afloat in the city, to the effect that Louise has turned out to be the baron's daughter, or niece, or some relation. I don't know the rights of it exactly. But there must be something in it, since I have heard it from several different sources. Madame Sontum told me only yesterday that the baron had taken the girl home with him." 
               "I shouldn't wonder," replied Harcourt, carelessly. "You recollect the portrait in the gallery at the chteau, and the miniature I described Louise as wearing, which so greatly resembled it?" 
               "What of that?" 
               "Only that I hinted to you then that in my opinion Louise was other than what she seemed." 
               "Yes; but you thought you recollected these portraits. That would rather imply that Louise was your relative, or the relative of some one whom you have known," replied Staynor, laughingly. 
               "Just as probable as that she should be the baron's daughter," said Harcourt. "But I don't really credit the story. It's some idle rumor arising out of the singular termination mination of the trial, and the excitement it occasioned in the city." 
               "Perhaps so; that's the first sensible thing you have uttered; but we will visit the baron at the chteau, and learn for ourselves. And now suppose we take a stroll. The day is delightfully fine and warm, and we can walk slowly." 
               To this proposition Harcourt consented, and the two friends walked out together, and, on their return, Staynor proceeded to make arrangements for the anticipated visit to the chteau of the Baron Von Welden. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXVI. 
               CHANGES IN LIFE. 
               BARON VON WELDEN had for several years suffered under delicate health, and the exciting events which occurred during the latter portion of the session of the Bergen Supreme Court had tried him severely, and the trial had been all the more severe in consequence of the proud, stern disposition which led him, at all periods of his life and under any circumstances, to conceal his emotions from the vulgar gaze-to conceal them even from his best and most intimate friends. "He never told his grief," but permitted it to rankle and canker in his bosom, preserving an outward semblance of calm dignity, and even of hauteur, while his soul was steeped in bitterness, and often when the sympathy of a kind friend would have relieved him of half his burden of sorrow. His life-long grief for the loss of his wife and child, and for the deception of which he had been guilty in relation to the trust reposed in him by his cousin Ulrica Von Welden, had made him a solitude-loving, unhappy man, and had seriously undermined a constitution naturally feeble; and the anxiety of mind caused by the discovery of his daughter's existence; his belief that he was in duty bound to sit in judgment upon the youth he had wronged, and whose imagined guilt he laid at his own door, inasmuch as had Rolf been educated and watched over by him, as he ought to have been, he would not have been placed in the circumstances which it was believed had led him to commit the atrocious crime with which he was charged; and, above all, his belief that his newly-found child, ere yet she had been restored to her father's protecting care, had disappeared under circumstances which admitted of no favorable construction, had caused him days of concealed anguish of mind and sleepless nights of overwhelming misery. Even when his child was restored to him, more than ever worthy of his love and admiration, and when the youth he had wronged was proved to be innocent, the reaction in his feelings-the anguish and remorse changed to joy and thankfulness-had not tended to restore his health or to recruit his shattered nerves; and, though he alone was fully aware of the fact, he felt that he would not live long to enjoy the society of his child. 
               Ever since the revelation made by Carl Jansen, he had been anxious to learn whether the young Englishman, Henry Harcourt, was a connection of the family to which his wife, Mary Harcourt, had belonged. He had several times sent a messenger to inquire after the young man's health and his prospects of recovering from the effects of his accident, and had more than once repeated his invitation to both Harcourt and Staynor to visit him at his country seat before they quitted Norway. 
               He had, also, in the presence of Carl Jansen and Herr Bredell, seen Hilda Welden, and had informed her of the facts relating to her early life, with which the reader is already acquainted; and Hilda, still in deep distress on account of her brother's absence, had, at Louise's and the baron's pressing invitations, gone with her children to reside with them at the chteau. 
               Old Christian and Margaret Jansen had accepted the baron's offer of a cottage residence on his grounds, where they would be near Louise, and see her every day. Carl Jansen and Hans Petersen had both refused any remuneration from the baron for the services they had rendered; but the latter had accepted from Harcourt, after much persuasion, the fishing-sloop which had belonged to Rolf, and for which Harcourt had insisted upon paying Rolf the full value when he visited him to borrow money to enable him to carry out his purpose of going abroad. 
               Erik Lodbrok was still in jail awaiting his trial for perjury at the ensuing sessions; but although he was execrated by all who were aware of his villany, Louise seriously objected to appear in court as his prosecutor, and she persuaded her father to allow her to remain silent regarding the matter. Erik, therefore, would go forth free when the day appointed for his trial should arrive. 
               Herr Bredell was also at the chteau on a brief visit, at the period when Harcourt and Staynor proposed to accept the invitation of the baron. Consequently they would find there a large party of the friends and acquaintances they had made since they had been in Norway. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXVII. 
               THE RIDE TO THE CHATEAU. 
               "HAVE you ever read the poems of Ossian, or those of James Macpherson, if you choose to doubt the existance of Ossian?" asked Staynor of his friend, as they drove along the banks of the Fjord, on their way to the chteau, the morning after the conversation between them, recorded in a preceding chapter. 
               "Yes, occasionally," replied Harcourt, "and never without deprecating the pedantry of those persons who have thrown doubts upon their authenticity. If they be deceptions or forgeries, they are harmless ones, and why not permit us to indulge without dispute the pleasing suppositions that Fingal fought, and Ossian sung? But why do you ask?" 
               "Because it has often struck me that those simple and forcible descriptions are even more applicable to the scenery of this country than to that of the Scottish Highlands." 
               "I have not given the subject a thought, heretofore," replied Harcourt; "but now that you have brought the poems to my recollection, I acknowledge that there is some truth in what you say." 
               "Some truth, Harry! There is nothing but truth. They apply to the letter. For instance, do you recollect the passage in Ossian's address to the sun? It runs thus (watch the rays of the sun half obscured by yonder mass of heavy cloud above that precipice overhanging the Fjord, and covered with larch and beech-trees. See how his beams penetrate the dark foliage and reflect themselves in the deep waters, and listen): 
               "'Whence are thy beams, O Sun! thy everlasting light? Thou comest forth in thy awful beauty; the stars hide themselves in the sky; the moon, cold and pale, sinks in the western wave; but thou, thyself, movest alone. Who can be a companion of thy course? The oaks of the mountains fall; the mountains themselves decay with years; the ocean shrinks and grows again; the moon herself is lost in the brightness of thy course. When the world is dark with tempests, when thunder rolls and lightning flies, thou lookest in thy beauty from the clouds, and laughest at the storm.' 
               "Or, look forward at yonder peak on the Hardanger Fjeld, and at the clouds which obscure its base, and listen again: 
               "'Abrupt rises Gormal in snow! The tempests roll dark on his sides; but, calm above, his vast forehead appears. White, issuing from the skirts of his storms, the troubled torrents pour down his sides. Joining, as they roar along, they bear the Tarno in foam to the main.' 
               "Or, again, in the course of our travels, when we have been overtaken amid the wild scenery by a storm, has this description never occurred to you? 
               "'His shaggy brows wave dark above his gathered rage.' 
               "And, yet again, when gazing upon the mountain torrents: 
               "'Like two foam-covered streams from two rainy vales;' or, 'As rushes a stream of foam from the dark, shady deep of Cromla, when the thunder is traveling above, and dark-brown night sits on half the hill.'" 
               Staynor was so carried away with his enthusiasm, that he had risen from his seat in the carriage while giving utterance to these rhapsodies, and as they were now proceeding over a difficult and dangerous piece of road, endangered the safety of the vehicle. Harcourt caught him by the tail of his coat, and pulling him to his seat, said, laughingly, 
               "Pray sit down, Charley, and wait until we get into a safer road, or we shall ourselves become the heroes of a tragic scene for some future Ossian to sing. I was not aware that you were so poetically inclined." 
                
               "Confound you, Harry, you've interrupted me in the middle of one of my favorite quotations," said Staynor, resuming his seat, "and driven it clean out of my memory. Poetically inclined! No, I scorn the base insinuation. That is to say, I am not inclined to quote poetry in praise of every silken eyebrow, or dimpled cheek, or pretty pair of lips I chance to come across, as you are, and then to traduce the sex afterward; but when my imagination is kindled by such scenes as this-" 
               "You are tempted to run the risk of upsetting yourself and your friend into the Fjord beneath us," interrupted Harcourt. "We'll wait until we get to sea, or are traveling amid the tamer scenery of England, where the roads are safe, and then we can press Ossian into our service, and, by his aid, revive our recollections of the fjelds and fjords of Norway." 
               "Cease thy banter, O most unimaginative man. The moment of inspiration has passed away," said Staynor, with mock solemnity; and the road taking a turn which led the travelers into a valley, and concealed the mountains and the waters of the Fjord from their view, a different topic of conversation was taken up. 
               As the two friends proceeded on their way, they found sufficient occupation in admiring the soft beauty of the scenery of the valleys, affording a delightful contrast with the rugged grandeur of the more elevated road along the edge of the precipitous banks of the Fjord. It will be recollected that when they passed over this road for the first time, a violent storm had prevented them from observing its many beauties, and the signs of thrift and comfort, which became especially remarkable as they drew near the confines of the estate of Baron Von Welden. 
               On this present journey the atmosphere was delightfully serene. The sky was free from cloud, although a soft haze shielded them from the too direct rays of the midsummer sun, apparently more intense in high latitudes during their brief reign than in more sultry climes. The squirrels were sporting amid the foliage of the trees, so tame and trusting, that the near approach of the carriage did not alarm them. They merely ceased their gambols for a moment, and raising themselves on their hind legs, listened attentively, and gazed with curiosity upon the intruders into their sylvan domains, and as soon as the vehicle had passed, resumed their feats of agility with redoubled vigor. The birds were singing blithely in the shade of the copses, making the air vocal with their ravishing notes; and the sleepy hum of busy insects, and the gentle murmur of the waving foliage, and musical ripple of the numerous rivulets-winding their devious way on each side of the road, until, by some secret outlet, they emptied themselves into the briny waters of the Hardanger Fjord-completed a living picture of dreamy beauty that might have inspired the author of the "Castle of Indolence" when he wrote: 
                      
                        "-Was naught around but images of rest: 
                        Sleep-soothing groves and quiet lawns between; 
                        And flowery beds that slumberous influence kest, 
                        From poppies breathed; and beds of pleasant green, 
                        Where never yet was creeping creature seen. 
                        Meanwhile, unnumbered glittering streamlets played, 
                        And hurld everywhere their watery sheen; 
                        That as they bickered through the sunny glade, 
                        Though restless still, themselves a lulling murmur made. 
                        Joined to the prattle of the purling rills, 
                        Were heard the lowing herds along the vale, 
                        And flocks loud bleating from the distant hills, 
                        And vacant shepherds, piping in the dale: 
                        And, now and then, sweet philomel would wail, 
                        Or stock-doves 'plain amid the forest deep, 
                        That drowsy rustled to the sighing gale; 
                        And still a coil the grasshoppers did keep; 
                        Yet all these sounds yblent, inclind all to sleep." 
                     
                  
                
               The harvest had, by this time, been gathered in, and the peasants were keeping holiday. Although intemperance has long been deemed, and with too much truth, a prevailing vice among the Northmen, nothing of the kind was yet observable. What the drinking orgies of the evening might give rise to, it is not our province to surmise; but the calm summer morning only saw groups of well-dressed, happy peasantry hastening to the house of God, to render thanks to Him for the bountiful harvest which had blessed their labors. Husbands and wives, grandfathers and grandchildren, of both sexes, fathers and mothers, sons and daughters; young men and maidens, who, to judge from appearnces, seemed to aspire to the respectable position of married couples, were met in numbers that, rare as was the sight of farm-house or cottage, astonished the young travelers. 
               The attire of the men, women, and children comprising these happy groups, was peculiar, neat, and decidedly picturesque. The men were dressed in white jackets, black breeches, and white stockings. A few of the younger men-the Beau Brummells of the rural district-were more bravely attired. These wore darker clothes, with scarlet buttonholes, ornamented waistcoats, and a scarlet band below each knee. 
               The women wore short petticoats, scarcely reaching to the knees, that their bright-red stockings might be seen and duly admired, and aprons of gaudy colors. They generally wore rings on their fingers and their bosoms were thickly spangled with ornaments, and each woman had her Lutheran prayer-book, neatly pinned in a white handkerchief. 
               "Where on earth do all these people come from?" said Staynor, addressing the driver. "I see only here and there a cottage-a mile apart." 
               "There are many farm-houses and cottages hidden amid the trees, Herren Engliskmands," answered the driver, "which no one would discover unless acquainted with the paths leading to them." 
               "And these people are going to the church?" 
               "Yes, herren." 
               "Where is the church? I should like to see it. Is it near here?" 
                
               "It is not far distant. A little out of the direct road; but if the herren wish, I will take them thither." 
               "Do so, driver," said Staynor, and the coachman turned into a by-road, and very soon they came in sight of the sacred edifice. 
               It proved to be a strange-looking building, of a style of architecture utterly at variance with the rules of art. It appeared like a heap of small Norwegian pine cottages, painted red, and planted side by side, and heaped one above another-with very little regard to regularity-in most picturesque confusion. A spire ascending from the center chamber, towered into the air, and, in honor of the day of thanksgiving, was decorated with sheafs of wheat and barley, surmounted with various gayly-colored flags. 
               By the time the party reached the church, service had commenced; but the young men alighted from the vehicle and entered the building. 
               To their great surprise, their friend, the Reverend Mr. Bredell-the pastor of Tunes-proved to be the officiating clergyman, and, looking around them, they saw in a pew near the pulpit, raised higher than the rest, but otherwise undistinguished from the seats occupied by the peasantry, the Baron Von Welden, Louise Sigvald, and Hilda Welden, and to their right, seated in the body of the church, were old Christian and Margaret Jansen. 
               "It seems as if there were truth in the report we have heard," whispered Harcourt, to his companion, indicating by a motion of his head, the presence of his old friends of the island of Sartaroe. 
               "Yes," was the brief response; "but we shall know after the service is over." 
               The prayers were short and the sermon was not long, and at its conclusion, the baron and the pastor, who had noticed the presence of the young Englishmen, came forward and welcomed them. 
               A very brief conversation served to satisfy the young men that the rumors which had proclaimed Louise to be the daughter of the Baron Von Welden were correct. 
               The baron and Herr Bredell heartily welcomed the young men to the Harvest-home; but it was with pain that the latter noticed the ravages which anxiety had made in the countenance of their former host at the chteau;. 
               They were informed that it was the tenantry of the baron who were thus keeping holiday; that the tenantry were to partake of a dinner at the chteau, and that the remainder of the day was to be spent in various rustic national games. The chteau was but a few miles distant, and thither the party proceeded together; the baron's carriage containing himself, Louise, Hilda, and the clergyman; while a less ostentatious, yet still a comfortable vehicle, conveyed old Jansen and his wife to their new home on the baron's estate. 
               Filled with astonishment as were the young men at this strange change in the condition of Louise and Hilda, there was no opportunity afforded them that day to listen to the particulars or to hold any private conversation with any of the parties. An abundant dinner, at which the baron and the pastor presided, awaited the arrival of the cortge at the chteau. Dancing, singing, wrestling, ball-playing, and a variety of gymnastic exercises followed, until near ten o'clock at night, in all of which amusements the baron and his guests figured prominently. Supper, with a liberal allowance of beer, wine, and brandy, followed, and at midnight the tenantry departed for their own homes, loud in their praises of their generous landlord; and long after they had left the chteau, the noble host and his guests lingered to listen to the sound of the voices of the happy party, as singing loudly in merry chorus, they wound their way over the hills and amid the valleys to their own cottage homes. 
               The baron and his friends and guests listened until the last faint cadence died away, and midnight silence succeeded to the late sounds of innocent revel, then each bade the other goodnight, and the household was soon wrapped in slumber. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXVIII. 
               A VISIT OF ANTICIPATED PLEASURE PROVES TO BE A VISIT TO A HOUSE OF MOURNING. 
               WHEN Harcourt arose on the following morning he strolled out into the grounds surrounding the chteau, leaving his friend Staynor, who was inclined to sleep o' mornings, still in bed. The baron was habitually an early riser, and Harcourt, on entering the flower-garden, saw his host and the clergyman watching the graceful evolutions of the denizens of a fish-pond at the further extremity of the garden. Both gentleman bade the young man good-morning as he drew near them, and then, as if by preconcerted arrangement, the pastor walked away in an opposite direction, leaving the baron and his youthful guest together. 
               "It must have surprised you not a little, Herr Harcourt," said the baron, "to hear of the strange circumstances which led to the discovery that Louise, the supposed daughter of a Norwegian pilot, was, in reality, my child, lost to me almost since the day of her birth?" 
               "Undoubtedly it did surprise me, Herr Baron," said the young man, perceiving that his host awaited a reply, yet scarcely knowing what to say. 
               "I am glad to meet you alone this morning," continued the baron. "Since the day you visited me on your way to the Hardanger Fjeld, I have been troubled in my mind on your account. What would you say, young gentleman, should it turn out that you and I are related?" 
               "It is scarcely possible," replied the young man. "I do not see any cause to lead to such a supposition; still, Herr Baron, I should be proud of such a connection." 
               "Your name is the same as that of my beloved and lamented wife," answered the baron. "I understand that the name is not a common one in England. Louise's mother was Mary Harcourt. Have you a sister, young sir?" 
               "I have a sister, Alice, several years younger than myself," replied Harcourt. "She could not be the mother of Louise?" 
               "To be sure not. I was foolish in asking the question; but we are apt, as we grow older ourselves, to forget the lapse of years since we were young, and to believe that, notwith-standing we have sunk into the sear and yellow leaf, those whom we knew in the heyday of youth, still remain as last we beheld them. I am doubtless wrong in my surmises. You have no relation but this sister living?" 
               "None, Herr Baron, of the family from which I derive my name. My mother is living, and I am sole heir to the Harcourt estate, which, by the way, was left sadly impoverished by my father. I had, however, an aunt Mary, who married a foreign gentleman in Paris, twenty years ago, or more. I forget the name, for my aunt was seldom alluded to in the family; but it was not Von Welden." 
               "What became of the lady?" asked the baron, greatly agitated. 
               "I believe she was lost at sea, with her husband. Our family has been sadly disunited. Herr Baron, and I know little of its antecedents." 
               "Was the name of the gentleman who married your aunt, Von Graaf?" asked the baron. 
               "It was, I believe," replied the young man; "he is said to have been a foreign adventurer, and my grandfather disowned his daughter on hearing of the marriage." 
               "I was at that time the Baron Von Graaf," said the baron, taking the hand of the young man, who, conscious that he had spoken disrespectfully of his host, was greatly embarrassed. 
                
               The baron comprehended the cause of his confusion. 
               "I was then little better than a foreign adventurer, my young friend, and I may now say, my relative," he observed. "Yet, it was for no hope of gain I married your aunt. It was a marriage entered into on both sides for pure affection's sake, and never was wife more deeply, truly, sincerely mourned than my poor Mary has been." 
               This unexpected and startling revelation astonished Harcourt to such a degree that he was unable to reply. 
               "If this be true," he thought to himself, "the Baron Von Welden is my uncle, and Louise is my cousin! Good heaven, to what a singular series of events has this chance visit to Norway led!" 
               "Let us walk out into the grove, my young friend," said the baron, observing the young man's embarrassment, "and, if you will listen with patience, I will explain every thing to you respecting our relationship, and the means through which I became cognizant of it." 
               Without replying, Henry Harcourt accompanied his host beyond the garden, until they had reached the woods, when they seated themselves in a rustic summer-house, and the baron related to his young friend and relative the details with which the reader has already been made acquainted. 
               No doubt could any longer exist in the mind of the youth, and it was with a singular admixture of feelings, which may be more readily imagined than described, that he returned with the baron to the house, and took his seat at the breakfast-table with Louise and Hilda, and his friend, Charles Staynor. 
               There was little conversation at the table. The pastor had been made aware beforehand of the suspicions of his patron. The baron was absorbed in reverie, as was, also, Henry Harcourt, and the remainder of the party labored under the embarrassment which is always felt when an air of mystery pervades a portion of a friendly circle. 
               "I shall leave you to explain to Louise that which has come to our knowledge this morning, my young friend," said the baron, watching an opportunity to speak to the young people, when the party rose from the breakfast-table, "and, afterward you can make such explanations to Hilda and to Herr Staynor as you may think fit. The Herr Bredell is acquainted with the matter already. If you, Herr Staynor, and you, Hilda," addressing them especially, "will accompany me to the conservatory, where I have some choice plants, lately imported, to show you, we will leave Herr Harcourt and my daughter together. They have something to communicate to each other." 
               As a matter of course, the request of the baron was complied with, although Hilda and Staynor left the room curious to know why Louise and Henry were left together; and Louise herself was at a loss to comprehend her father's meaning. 
               It is unnecessary to repeat what occurred during the private conference of Harcourt and Louise. In the course of an hour they came forth from the apartment and Henry joined his friend, Staynor, and briefly explained to him the apparent mystery of the morning. 
               "Now I shall give you credit for a soothsayer," said Staynor, when he had listened to Harry's recital. "The miniature and the picture in the gallery are accounted for; but, in truth, it is a singular affair. What do you intend to do? Has this revelation changed your mind as to your future movements?" 
               "Not at all," replied Harcourt. "The baron-my uncle I suppose I must now term him-the title sounds strange; but I suppose I shall get used to it-is evidently failing. I noticed it as soon as he spoke to me in the church yesterday. He confessed to it himself this morning. The events that have occurred of late have rendered Norway distasteful to him. He tells me that he thinks a change of climate will be beneficial to him, if anything will; but that I doubt-and he talkes of selling his estates, and with the proceeds purchasing land in the Territory of Wisconsin, which he thinks will soon become one of the States of the Union. It would appear that this is no new fancy, for he speaks understandingly of America, as if he had long studied the history of that growing country. He says that the germ of a Norwegian colony is already established in Wisconsin, and that the influence of a man of education and wealth will materially aid its advancement. Our friend, the baron, is not a Norwegian by birth, but he has been many years one by adoption. Although a Prussian, he is in heart and feeling a true Norseman." 
               "And you; what did you reply?" 
               "I made no reply. It was not my duty to endeavor to influence a man like the Baron Von Welden; but he will need to use haste, or he will never live to see America." 
               "And should he die, what will then become of poor Louise?" 
               "Poor Louise will in that case succeed to the possession of a handsome estate; magnificent for this country-ample anywhere. She, I presume, will get married, and probably settle down for life where she now is." 
               "Married to her old lover, Rolf Frode?" 
               "Bah! Rolf Frode was the betrothed of Louise Sigvald. Louise Von Welden will strike at higher game." 
               "That I doubt, sir woman-hater. I have already observed, and you must also have noticed, that the poor girl is grieving sorely for Rolf's absence. She is greatly changed since I saw her at Tunes, and then how strongly she is attached to Hilda." 
               "Perhaps grieving because her present condition places her in a position in which she can not offer her hand-at least while her father lives-to Hans Petersen, with whom she undertook the journey to the Hardanger Fjeld." 
               "Harry, you are incorrigible: such remarks savor of gross ingratitude. To save her lover from unmerited ignominy and undeserved punishment, Louise dared to risk the censures of the little world within her own limited sphere, and, scarcely less generous than she, that noble young fellow, Hans, risked a toilsome and hazardous journey to serve a successful rival, with a bare possibility of success; and recollect, furthermore, that what would be considered rash and unmaidenly in more polished and refined society than that to which Louise has heretofore been accustomed, is not so regarded by those with whom her lot has been cast. The very fact of her having acted as she has done, is proof of the innocence and purity, to say nothing of the generosity, of her intentions." 
               "You are enthusiastic in your praises, Charley." 
               "I have reason. It vexes me to hear you traduce the motives of this generous girl." 
               "What did Rolf Frode himself think of her conduct?" 
               "Rolf has proved himself to be still more foolish than you. I see no excuse for his conduct. He should at least have seen Louise and Hans before he allowed himself to be carried away by the Quixotic notions of propriety which have led him to exile himself from his home and his friends; but he has met the reward of his folly and ingratitude." 
               "How so?" asked Harcourt. 
               "He has lost, for a time at least, advantages which would have otherwise been secured to him ere this. While you were holding your long conversation with the baron, I walked out with Herr Bredell. From him I learned that Rolf's name is Swensen, not Frode, and that he and his sister Hilda, who, you know, bears the same name as the baron, were, when children, protegs of Ulrica Von Welden-a cousin of the baron's. They are the children of a deceased officer, Captain Swensen, and the baron holds a considerable property in trust for them. Hilda will be placed in possession of it in the absence of her foolish brother, who may never hear of the good fortune which has befallen him." 
               "This is astonishing!" exclaimed Harcourt; "another coil to the tangled chain of circumstances which have made me a prominent actor in a romance of lively interest. However, Rolf will be found. He writes that he intends to go to the United States. You and I are going thither. We will seek him out; advertise for him; find him, by some means or other; and, after all, things may turn out well. If it be as Herr Bredell tells you, Rolf may yet marry Louise." 
               "There, you speak reasonably," resumed Staynor. "That is the first sensible remark you have made; but I am well aware, in spite of your pretended misanthropy, that you don't mean half you say, otherwise I should doubt your friendship." 
               Harcourt smiled, but made no reply, and the two friends, observing the baron and the rest of the party to be approaching, advanced to meet them. 
               They adjourned to the picture-gallery, where their host led them to the portrait of the late Baroness Von Graaf, and caused them to acknowledge the close resemblance between the portrait and the miniature of the deceased lady worn by Louise. A drive over the extensive estate of the baron, prolonged by frequent stoppages to afford opportunities of admiring the scenery from the most romantic points of view, occupied the hours till dinner time, when the party returned to the chteau, and the remainder of the day was spent in in-door amusements and in conversation upon the various topics of the day; the travels of the young men; the early adventures of the baron, and the experiences of the pastor in his own comparatively quiet and monotonous career. 
               On the following morning the clergyman departed for his praestegard, and Harcourt and Staynor also rose from their beds in the expectation of returning that day to the city, but, at the urgent request of their host, they consented to prolong their visit for a week. 
               There was quite sufficient amusement, in the way of shooting and fishing, to occupy the time, and render the visit agreeable, and in their excursions to the forests and streams, the baron always accompanied them, not, however, to join in the sport, for though he carried a gun or a rod, he rarely made use of either, and, indeed, usually left his young guests to pursue their sports alone after proceeding with them to some sheltered nook, where he could repose himself upon the grass. Often the young men would forsake their sport and seat themselves beside their host, and his conversation on these occasions led both Harcourt and Staynor to believe that the idea of emigrating to America had taken a greater hold upon his imagination than even they had imagined when first he had spoken on the subject. 
               In fact, he led them to infer that he had already entered into arrangements for the conversion of his lands into ready money, and that he intended to carry his plans into effect at as early a period as possible. 
               It was evident that the baron was perfectly aware of the declining condition of his health; that perceptible as it was to others, it was still more so to him, and he intimated his intention of spending the ensuing winter months in southern Europe. He seemed to dread the rigors of the northern winter, to which he had been for so many years accustomed. A tour to the south of France during the winter months, he said, would, he trusted, tend to the restoration of his shattered health, and in the course of the following spring he hoped to meet Harcourt, whom now he took delight in addressing as his nephew, in the United States. 
               Sometimes Harcourt feared that the mind of his host was giving way, he spoke so incoherently: the secret of a wrong committed-the guilt of which he perhaps over-estimated, since he had really intended no permanent injury to his wards-so long pent up in his bosom, and at length disclosed under such exciting circumstances, and the discoveries which had subsequently ensued; the anxieties he had of late endured, and the efforts his pride had made to conceal the conflicting emotions with which his breast was torn-had been too much for him. The hour of struggle, during which he had nerved himself to a stoical endurance, past, the reaction had been too powerful for his enfeebled frame to withstand, and the young man feared that he had found an uncle, and Louise a father, only to lose him, ere yet they fully realized the discovery. 
                
               Louise and Hilda the young men seldom saw, except at mealtimes, and sometimes for an hour or two in the evenings. Both young women grieved sorely over the rash self-exile of Rolf, and although Louise had found a long lost parent-a parent of whose existence she had been ignorant-and the condition of herself and her companion, Hilda, had been improved beyond what either had ever dreamed of, it appeared doubtful whether both would not have been happier had they remained in their humble but contented condition on the island of Sartaroe. Old Jansen and Margaret were comfortably situated, and Louise and Hilda spent a considerable portion of each day with them; but the old couple did not themselves appear to be happy. Some somber cloud, some gloomy distrust, some foreboding of trouble hanging over them and about to overwhelm them, had gained possession of their minds, and more than once, when Harcourt met the old light-house keeper, the latter, in reply to the young man's inquiries relative to his health and happiness, would shake his head and say, 
               "Ah! so-well, Herr Henry. It is good here. I am glad for Louise and Hilda; but I was happy at Sartaroe. Ah! if I was twenty years younger, and once again keeper of the light-house, with little Louise and Hilda for my children, to play around me! Ah! Louise is now a Froken,
                  
                     "Froken," a young lady of a superior class.
                   but is she more happy than when she played about the light-house and rambled on the cliffs of Sartaroe?" 
               And, although old Margaret Jansen smoked her pipe in quiet, and, sitting at the doorway of the snug little cottage the baron had provided for her and her husband, basked in the sun, or enjoyed the shade of the trees which surrounded the neat abode, her thoughts ever seemed to wander back to the rocky shores of the desert island where so many years of her life had been passed. 
               The day appointed for the departure of Harcourt and Staynor drew near, the week was drawing to a close, and but one entire day remained to them at the chteau. Hilda and Louise had remained in the dining-room during the whole evening, and the party, the baron in particular, had been in better spirits than usual. Louise rarely mentioned Rolf's name, but Hilda had more than once, in the course of the evening, expressed a hope that when Harcourt visited America, he would exert himself to find her brother, and would, if he were successful in his search, urge his return. 
               This the young man had promised, but, in his turn, expressed his opinion that before long, they would all meet in the United States. 
               When, at length, the young women retired, the baron sat for an extra hour with his young friends. His conversation was lively, and he intimated that every thing was progressing favorably in regard to his anticipated departure from Norway, and that he would be in America almost as soon as they. 
               "We will all drive to Tunes to-morrow," he said, as he shook hands with the young men, before the party separated for the night, "and spend the day at the praestgarde, and we will bring Herr Bredell and his wife and daughters back with us, and the next day, if you must depart, we will all accompany you to Bergen." 
               The young men expressed themselves delighted with this arrangement and each bade the other good night, in good spirits and in the anticipation of a pleasant re-union in the morning. 
               Shortly after midnight the sound of a bell rung violently awakened Harcourt. Presently the ring was repeated. Thus suddenly aroused in the middle of the night, in a house where usually every sound was hushed after the family had retired, the young man became alarmed. He sprang from his bed and lighting his night-lamp, sought the sleeping-apartment of his friend, whom he found up and partially clothed, and about to come forth from his chamber to seek him. Before either had time to speak the bell sounded again, more violently than before. 
                
               "What can be the matter?" said Staynor. 
               "I can not say," was the reply. "Perhaps there are robbers in the house, or some one is, perhaps, seized with illness." 
               "Let us go and see," replied Staynor. "I hear people stiring." 
               Staynor had been putting on the remainder of his clothing while he was speaking, and was now completely dressed. Harcourt hurried back to his chamber to put on his own clothing, and in another minute rejoined his friend, and together they set forth to learn the cause of this unwonted interruption to the stillness of night. 
               The chteau was an immense, irregular structure, having long and winding galleries extending from one end of the mansion to the other, and the apartments occupied by the young men were situated in the opposite extremity of the building to those occupied by the baron and the members of his own family. Although they had resided a week at the chteau they were still ignorant of the intricacies of the dwelling, and by the dim light of the lamps they had considerable difficulty in threading their way through the tortuous windings. At length, however, they met the French valet of the baron, with fright depicted in his countenance. He was giving orders to a footman to saddle a horse and hasten with all possible speed to Bergen for medical assistance. 
               "What is the matter, Eugene?" said Harcourt, addressing the man in the French language. 
               "Monsieur le Baron est bien malade, monsieur." 
               "Ha! que lui est il arrive?" asked the young man. 
               "Vraiment, monsieur, je ne sais pas; mais j'ai peur qu'il a eu une attaque d'apoplexie," responded the valet, as he moved away to give further orders to the servant. 
               "Which is the baron's bedroom?" asked Staynor of another servant who now made his appearance. 
               "It is there, monsieur," replied the man, pointing to a door at the further extremity of the gallery. 
                
               The valet now passed the young man on his way back to his master's room. 
               "Can we go in? Can we see the baron, or be of any assistance?" inquired Harcourt. 
               "Entrez, messieurs; toute la maison sont ici," was the reply, and entering the room, the young man found there Louise and Hilda, and several servants who had been awakened by the turmoil, or had been summoned to render assistance. 
               The baron, who, it appeared, had fallen on the floor after having rung the first alarm which had awakened Harcourt and his friend-the second and third alarms had been given by the valet, who had slept in an adjoining room, and who had immediately answered his master's summons-had been raised up and carried to his bed, where he lay extended on his back. He was fully clothed, but his neckcloth and shirt-collar had been loosened, and he was now breathing heavily, and quite insensible. Louise, pale and agitated, yet still exerting herself to the utmost, stood by the bedside, holding one of her father's hands in hers, while with the other she bathed his brow with cold water, handed to her by Hilda, whose countenance betrayed extreme affright. 
               "You had better leave the room for the present, Mlle. Louise," said Harcourt, noticing the young girl's agitation. "I will take your place." 
               "No-no, Herr Harcourt," was the reply. "I will not leave my father; I am frightened but not incapable. Will you take Hilda away; she is so terrified-see, she spills the water!" 
               Hilda, who appeared ready to faint, was led away by Staynor, who placed the bowl of water she had held in the hands of a servant. 
               "What can I do to aid you, Louise?" asked Harcourt. "Can I send or go for any assistance?" 
               "Servants have already gone for medical assistance," replied Louise; "but it is so far. Only one physician lives, they say, between here and Bergen. He will come, and then they will go on to Bergen, so I have told them. But, Herr Harcourt, I wish Herr Bredell was here. Can you order a servant to go to Tunes; perhaps you, yourself, will accompany him. The pastor will better comprehend; and please, Herr Harcourt, to tell grandmother Margaret to come directly to me as you pass the lodge." 
               "I will do all this, Mile. Louise," said the young man. "But I fear this will be too much for you?" 
               "No-no," replied the young girl, impatiently. "My place, now, is by my father. But is it not dreadful, Herr Henry, so long before I found my father, and to see him thus so soon?" 
               Tears trembled in the eyes of the young woman as she spoke, and even escaped and trickled down her pale cheek, while her lips quivered and her voice was choked with a suppressed sob; but quickly overcoming her emotion, she renewed her task of bathing her father's brow and wiping his colorless lips. 
               Staynor, who now returned to the room, advanced to the bed and felt the pulse of the stricken man. His adventurous life had rendered him active and efficient in almost any case of emergency. He shook his head and asked in a whisper of Harcourt, whether a medical man was at hand. 
               "Louise tells me there is but one between the chteau and Bergen," was Harcourt's reply. 
               "The baron must be bled, directly," said Staynor. 
               "Who is to bleed him?" 
               "I." 
               "Are you capable of the task?" 
               "I have performed it a dozen times." 
               "Then set to work at once. I will speak to Louise, and endeavor to persuade her to remove from the bedside." 
               Staynor took a small penknife with a sharp and highly polished blade, from his pocket, and removing his coat, declared himself prepared. 
               Meanwhile Harcourt had intimated to Louise that the only hope of restoring her father to consciousness lay in bleeding his arm. 
                
               "Do you think so?" said she. "Who is here to bleed him?" 
               "Herr Staynor will do so. You had better retire meanwhile, Louise." 
               "No, Herr Henry, I will stay. I am not frightened. I will not leave my father." 
               Every remonstrance was unavailing, and the brave girl stood by while Staynor pierced the vein of the baron's left arm with his temporary lancet, having slit up the striken man's coat-sleeve to bare the limb; and while the blood flowed, at first sluggishly and then more freely, she retained her post, still holding her father's right hand in hers. Only once, when Staynor applied the pointed blade to the vein, she shuddered convulsively; but immediately controlling her emotion, she stood until the arm was bandaged, with lips compressed tightly and eyes fixed upon her father's face, but without blenching. She was rewarded, by finding that he breathed much easier when the operation was performed; indeed he now seemed to be sleeping quietly, and when the bed-clothes had been rearranged, she turned to Harcourt and again begged him to send or go for the pastor, "and for grandmother-"she added, but she was unable to complete the sentence. The trial had proved too much for her and she fainted, and would have fallen had not the young man caught her in his arms, and carried her to a sofa. Then summoning a maid-servant to her assistance, he set forth to do her behest. 
               Staynor was satisfied that all had been done that could be done, until the arrival of the physician; indeed, he no longer apprehended any immediate danger; therefore, taking it upon himself to regulate the household for the time being, he requested every one but the baron's valet to leave the room, and seated himself by the table, in the chair which it appeared the baron had occupied when he felt the fit coming on, and had risen to ring the bell. 
               A large German map of the Western States of America lay on the table, and a parallel rule and a pair of compasses beside the map, showed that the baron had been lately studying its topography; but the map had been pushed aside, and at the edge of the table lay a Danish Bible, open at the 24th chapter of Deuteronomy, and marked with pencil at the 17th verse: 
               "Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless, nor take a widow's raiment to pledge." 
               Pencil marks having reference to other verses of the sacred book, wherein like denunciations are recorded, nearly filled a sheet of paper lying near the Bible. 
               Staynor had heard sufficient from Mr. Bredell in relation to the former guardianship over Rolf and Hilda, with which the baron had been intrusted by his deceased cousin, to lead him to believe, from these evidences of self-accusation, that the unhappy man had been pondering over the false step in his earlier life-which had haunted his mind ever since, and which, though the wrong had been partially redressed, he could not bring himself to believe had been forgiven-at this moment he had been seized with the fit, which would, in all probability, banish for ever, in this world, all recollections of the good or evil he had done during his life. 
               Daylight was approaching. The young man rose from his chair, and took another look at his patient, who was still, apparently, sleeping soundly and quietly. So far all was well. The young man drew the chair nearer to the bed, reseated himself, and after three or four vain endeavors to keep his own eyelids open, he gave way to the demand of over-fatigued nature, and was soon sleeping soundly. 
               He was aroused at the expiration of two hours by the entrance into the bedroom of the physician who lived nearest the chteau. 
               The man of medicine, who was not the family physician of the baron, on receiving a summons to proceed to the chteau, had hastened to obey it with all possible dispatch. Suspecting Staynor to be a friend of the baron's, he somewhat haughtily turned from the valet, who had entered the room with him, and who was explaining the symptoms of his master's disorder, and addressed himself to the young Englishman; but the latter found the doctor's language-he spoke in the Norsk dialect-totally unintelligible. He addressed the doctor in French and German alternately, but equally in vain. At length he bethought himself of addressing him through the valet, who would act as interpreter. 
               This plan was successful; but now the village doctor, discovering that the supposed friend of the noble baron was merely a foreign traveler on a short visit to the chteau, thought proper to show his own importance by finding fault with every thing that had been done. Bleeding, he said, should not have been attempted, and the noble patient should not be permitted to sleep so long. It was fortunate he had been called in, or there was no saying how things would have turned out. He was about summarily to attempt to arouse the baron from the slumber or stupor in which he lay; but Staynor himself, dubious of the orthodoxy of his own amateur practice, was satisfied that the ignorant country disciple of Esculapius knew less than he, and fearful of the consequences which might ensue should the former put into practice his extempore method of treatment, he resolved at once to assert his own self-elected authority over the people of the chteau until the baron should revive, or the pastor of Tunes make his appearance. 
               "Harkee, sir," said he to the valet, in French, "take that man into the steward's room and dose him with beer or brandyvin, and keep him there until medical aid arrives from Bergen. Tell him what I say, and mind, if he shows his face in this room again, he will make a hasty exit out of the window, as sure as my name is Charles Staynor." 
               The village Esculapius remonstrated and grumbled, but noticing the determination expressed in the young man's countenance, he presently retired with the valet nor was he seen again until noon, when the messengers who had been dispatched to Bergen arrived with two of the most eminent physicians of the capital. 
               By this time the patient had begun to show symptoms of wakefulness, and the physicians having made their examination, and learned from Staynor what method of treatment he had employed, expressed their satisfaction, and declared that they could do nothing until the patient awoke of his own accord. The village doctor, who, under cover of his professional brethren from the city had again entered the sick chamber, now came forward and, through M. Eugene, expressed his hope that the English gentleman would say nothing of what had occurred in the earlier part of the day. 
               Staynor observed contemptuously that he should not trouble himself further about the matter, and the doctor sneaked away, without further remark-satisfied, at least, that he would have a bill to present for extraordinary attendance at the chteau, and would henceforward be enabled to boast that he had once been sent for in case of emergency to prescribe for the Baron Von Welden. 
               In another hour, the baron opened his eyes and gazed vacantly about him, but he appeared to recognize nobody present, and in a few moments again closed his eyelids and appeared to slumber. 
               "We must not let him sleep again, just now, if we can help it," said one of the physicians, to Staynor, speaking in the German language. 
               "What had better be done?" said the young man. 
               "I have heard," continued the physician, "that the baron has lately recovered a long-lost daughter. It would be well if she were called and would stand by his bed. His returning faculties will probably revert to her in the first place. To restore him to consciousness is the main thing. Is the young lady at the chteau, and can she be induced to do as I say?" 
               "Undoubtedly," replied Staynor. "She is with a friend of hers in an adjoining room, and only too anxious to be admitted. I could only restrain her by telling her that her father was sleeping quietly and that I feared the presence of too many persons in the room might be hurtful to him. She behaved like a heroine, last night, and only gave way at last, after going through what, under the circumstances, few could have done. But, tell me, doctor, is there any hope of the baron's recovery?" 
               The physician shook his head, and answered gravely, 
               "He will recover from the stupor in which he now lies, but he will never be well again. There is not sufficient strength in his frame to permit of his rallying. The Baron Von Welden, sir, whose family physician I have, for many years, had the honor to be, has long suffered under a chronic malady which has baffled the utmost skill of his medical advisers. I have often thought it had its origin in some great mental affliction, and once hinted as much to him; but he repulsed the idea so sternly that I dared never to allude to the subject again. He is a good man, but proud and haughty, sir Englishman, and the endeavors he has made to conceal from all the world, ay, even from his physicians, both his mental anxieties and his bodily weaknesses, have, as I have long secretly prognosticated, proved too much for him." 
               "Still he may live for years; perhaps a removal to a more genial climate-" 
               "Will never restore him to health," interrupted the physician, courteously. "This is a shock, sir Englishman, which his nervous system will never recover. It is wrecked, sir-wrecked. He may live for months, but a second stroke would kill him instantly, and, in all probability, a few weeks, at most, will see him in his grave. It were, perhaps, well it should be so. He will then die in possession of his senses, otherwise, he will linger on for a time, a wreck alike in body and mind." 
               "Poor Louise!" sighed Staynor: "but, see, doctor, the patient stirs!" 
                
               "Send at once for the young lady," was the physician's reply. 
               In a few moments Louise and Hilda, both pale and agitated, entered the room, and the former took her post by the side of her stricken parent, in silence. She thanked the young Englishman with a look of gratitude; but, perhaps, could not trust herself to speak. 
               The sick man continued to turn himself uneasily on his bed, but for some time did not unclose his eyelids; at length he again opened his eyes and gazed vacantly, yet with a troubled air, at his daughter. 
               "Speak, young lady," said the physician, advancing and feeling the pulse of the sick man. 
               "Do you know me, dear father?" said Louise, bending over him, and kissing his forehead, while her eyes filled with tears. 
               The baron essayed to speak, but his words were unintelligible and he nearly choked with the effort. Still it was possible that he knew the features or the voice of his child, for a gleam of consciousness was apparent in the expression of pain and anxiety on his countenance when he discovered his physical weakness. 
               "Remain where you are, young lady," said the physician, "if you are able to do so, and if the baron strives to speak again, bend down your ear to his lips, and reply to him if you catch his meaning, in a whisper, close to his ear." 
               Louise needed no bidding to stay, though her heart was swelling with grief and she could with difficulty restrain her tears. 
               Another quarter of an hour passed away, and the baron appeared to relapse into a state of stupor, from which he awoke with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes which they had not shown since he began to recover from the stroke. 
               Again Louise bent over him and whispered softly but distinctly in his ear, 
                
               "Do you know me, Louise, father, dear?" 
               A smile and the monosyllable, "Yes," was the response. 
               "Then I will remain by you, dear father. Do not speak again, just now. You will soon be well," whispered the young girl. 
               Another faint smile-a sad, faint smile-passed over the countenance of the baron, and his lips essayed to form a word, which might be "No," but which Louise was unwilling so to interpret. He tried to raise his hand to his daughter's face, and Louise took the cold, clammy hand in her's and raised it to her lips, and then stooped and kissed her father's cheek, and inclined her head beside his, on the pillow, and so, for an hour, they lay motionless and silent-the beautiful, youthful daughter, but a few weeks awakened to the knowledge that her father was living, and the stricken, dying father! 
               At the expiration of this period, the baron appeared to revive, and gained his voice, though he spoke faintly and slowly, sometimes unable fairly to articulate the words he wished to give utterance to, and sometimes taking Louise to be the wife whose loss he had so long and so sincerely mourned. Still he continued to improve, and by degrees spoke more coherently, and thanked his child for her attendence upon his sick bed, and thanked God that He had restored to him his long-lost daughter to nurse him in his hour of calamity. He talked so long that the physicians began to fear the exertion, if longer continued, would prove injurious; and the family physician, who assumed the chief control over the patient, motioned to Louise to endeavor to induce her father to lie down and sleep. 
               With quick intuition, the young girl understood the meaning of the doctor. 
               "You have been ill, dear father," she said, "and you are yet weak. Lie down and try to sleep, and I will watch by your side." 
               "And will never again leave me? You have been away many years," faintly ejaculated the sick man. 
                
               "Never, dear father," replied the maiden, and with his hand still resting in that of his daughter, and his gray hair mingling with her fair auburn ringlets as her head still pressed the pillow beside his, he closed his eyes, and appeared to sleep; but in a moment he murmured to himself, 
               "Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of strangers, nor of the fatherless," and opening his eyes, and endeavoring to raise himself in the bed, he cried, "Where is Rolf, and where is Hilda?" 
               "Hilda is here, dear father," said Louise. "Come here Hilda-my father calls you. "Hilda stepped to the side of the bed. "Here is Hilda, father," said Louise. 
               "No, no," answered the sick man; "Hilda was a child-but I forget; yes, that is she. Give me your hand, Hilda. I have restored the claims of the fatherless, and have not perverted the judgment of the stranger. But Rolf Swensen? I do not see Rolf." 
               "Rolf is away at sea, father. He will return by-and-by, and we shall all be happy. He has gone to America." 
               "Ah! yes; to America. We will all go, Louise, and leave this country, where for years I have been so lonesome and so miserable. I have settled every thing; we will go to-morrow, with the two strangers." 
               As he spoke these words his eyes closed, and he dropped to sleep. For a considerable time Louise, who was lying in a constrained and painful position, would not move lest she might awaken him; but at length, satisfied that he was sleeping soundly, she raised her head and looked into his face. He lay in a quiet, placid slumber-breathing as softly as an infant, and a gentle perspiration, which had broken out, suffused his face, and deepened the color of his cheek to such a degree that he looked as if he were already restored to health. 
               "My father will recover?" said Louise, raising her eyes to the face of the physician, and smiling with the feeling of renewed hope. 
                
               "I hope so, young lady," replied the physician; "he is much better now." 
               The doctor was himself a father, and he could not look into that fair face, and witness the smile which animated the features in spite of the tears which still glistened on the eyelids-weary and heavy with watching-and ruthlessly banish the hope which had entered into that youthful breast. 
               The baron lay until evening in a quiet but profound slumber, and awoke apparently so much better, that the new-born hope engendered in the breast of his child was strengthened to such a degree that she considered his recovery certain. Even Hilda and Staynor began to entertain a similar hope, and the former, secretly, again asked the opinion of the physician. 
               "The baron will recover from this attack," was the reply; "but I can give you no hope. His days are numbered." 
               Still Staynor would hope, and when, shortly after, the pastor of Tunes arrived with Harcourt and the servant who had gone to bring him to the chteau, the sick man recognized all his friends, and spoke himself so hopefully that the same feeling animated the spirits of the entire party. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXIX. 
               THE DEATH OF THE BARON. 
               THE young men did not leave the chteau, according to the arrangements they had made prior to the sudden illness of the baron. Harcourt felt that under the circumstances-taking into consideration his newly-discovered family connections with his host, and consequently with the young girl in whose welfare he had taught himself to feel so deep an interest-he felt that it would be both heartless and wrong to desert either, now that sickness and tribulation had visited them, and Staynor, at his friend's request, remained with him. 
               The physicians remained at the chteau, and the good pastor willingly watched in the sick chamber during the night, and Louise insisted upon keeping watch with him: but thoroughly fatigued as she was and rendered more easy in mind, since a favorable change had taken place in the symptoms of her father's disorder, she consented to rest on a sofa provided for her, and placed near the bed upon which the baron lay. 
               The remainder of the household, not anticipating any immediate necessity for their presence, and wearied with the fatigues of the day and of the previous night, retired at an early hour to their own rooms. 
               The next morning the baron was much better and apparently restored to perfect consciousness, and, at the expiration of two more days, he was enabled to rise from his bed and to sit, propped up in an arm-chair, in his room. His daughter was still his assiduous and affectionate nurse, and from the hands of no other person would he take his medicine or the light nourishment ishment allowed him by his family physician, who still continued a resident of the chteau-his coadjutor having returned to the city. Harcourt and Staynor occasionally visited the invalid for a short time, and the clergyman was almost constantly with him, although little conversation was permitted by the physician, and Hilda relieved Louise at short intervals during the day and night, when it became necessary for the latter to take some repose. 
               On the sixth day from the seizure, the invalid was permitted to take some light exercise in the gardens and grounds of the chteau, drawn in an easy carriage which had been provided for the purpose, and propped up with cushions and pillows. 
               It was a painful and pitiable sight to witness the change that these few days of severe illness had made in the baron's appearance. But one short week had passed since he had walked the grounds of his chteau, to outward semblance in perfect health, and with a prospect before him of many years of activity and usefulness-for he was not much past the meridian of life. Who that had then met him, and had casually encountered him again, as he was drawn in the carriage by his valet, would have recognized in the gaunt form and shrunken features, the dimmed eye and palsied limbs and vacant expression of countenance, the haughty lord of that large domain? 
               In the darkened chamber the change had not been so observable; but now, in the broad glare of day, those who had been constantly with him, who had been familiar with every change in the symptoms of his disorder, were shocked at the sight, as they looked upon the feeble, aged-looking man whose mental and bodily faculties seemed alike shattered. It seemed as if twenty years had been added to his age, in that one short week of pain and suffering. 
               Louise hoped still! When do those who love cease to hope? Never, until the angel of death has laid his cold hand upon the suffering one whom he has marked for his own and whose strength he has blighted with his destroying breath, and the pulses of life have ceased to beat, and the spirit has flown to him who gave it. 
               Now, for the first time, the others who had watched over the stricken man, fully credited the warning of the physician, and realized the near presence of death! 
               For the space of an hour the invalid appeared to revive under the influence of the bright, warm sunshine, and the light, invigorating breeze, and the pure, perfumed atmosphere, only fully appreciated by those who have breathed the confined air of a sick chamber: but even the gentle exercise of the hand-carriage was too much for his exhausted frame, and he sank back in his seat, unable longer to maintain even a partially erect position. His daughter was by his side in an instant. 
               "Do you feel worse, dear father?" she asked, as she bent over him, and, with the assistance of Hilda, re-arranged the cushions and pillows. "Shall Eugene return to the house?" 
               "Worse! no, better-better; who said I was worse?" feebly replied the invalid. "Let me go further-further-out in the broad fields. These trees and flowers pen me up and stifle me-" But he had scarcely uttered these words before he added, still more feebly, "Yes, Louise, my child, I will be taken home." 
               Arrived at the house, he was carried to his bedroom and laid on the bed, and the clergyman and the physician, who had walked out together, were both sent for, at the invalid's own request. 
               Half an hour afterward a messenger rode away from the chteau at full speed for Bergen, to demand the immediate attendance of the baron's attorney, and only when he heard the clatter of the horse's hoofs, as it galloped along the pebbly avenue which led to the main road, did the invalid appear satisfied. 
               Then he said he would like to sleep awhile. He felt fatigued; but better-yes, much better. 
               Louise was, as usual, in the room, standing by the bedside. He turned his face toward her and feebly raised his thin, white hand and pointed to the chair near the bed. His daughter understood him, and seating herself on the chair, she took the hand in her own, and gently whispered, 
               "Sleep now, dear father; try to sleep." 
               He did not reply to her; speech seemed painful to him; but he gazed into her face with a look of mingled love, and anxiety, and distress, that was pitiable to witness. 
               The young girl bent over him and kissed his cheek, and he smiled faintly and sadly, and murmured, "God bless her;" and then he closed his eyes, and seemed to slumber; but his lips still moved as if he were striving to speak, and his daughter placed her ear close to them to catch the sound; but all she could gather were the lowly-whispered words, repeated oft, 
               "So long-and so soon to part." 
               A shudder passed through her frame, and tears sprung to her eyes, for well she divined the import of those whispered words. 
               The physician had administered restoratives to his patient immediately upon his return to the house, and the pastor and the doctor still remained in the room. 
               The baron soon slept soundly and quietly, and both gentlemen now endeavored to prevail on Louise to retire to her own apartment; but she refused. She needed no rest, she said; her place was at her father's bedside, and so, still clasping her father's hand, she sat, for hours, patiently watching, until the return of the messenger from Bergen, with the attorney. 
               Soon after the arrival of the latter the invalid awoke. He seemed to be considerably revived. 
               "You here, still, my darling?" he murmured, addressing his daughter; "you will tax your own strength too much, my dear child." 
               Louise forced a smile and answered that she was not weary, and the physician, observing that his patient was awake, approached the bedside. As soon as the baron saw him, he asked anxiously, if the messenger who had been dispatched to Bergen had returned. 
                
               "He has," replied the physician, "and he has brought Herr Balston with him." 
               "Then let the attorney be summoned, and the pastor." 
               "I am here, my dear friend and patron," said the latter, coming forward, when he heard the request. 
               "Then, Louise, my darling, leave me now for a little while," said the baron. "You shall soon return to my bedside," he continued, noticing the unwillingness to quit the room, expressed in his daughter's face. "I have matters to settle, dear, which you will not understand, and which require privacy." 
               Louise raised the thin hand, which she still held, to her lips, and then placing it gently on the bed, released her hold, and without speaking a word, left the room. 
               Soon after, the attorney made his appearance, and for the space of an hour was closeted with the baron, the pastor, and the physician. 
               Louise, after leaving her father's bedside, had sought her own apartment; but she soon felt the atmosphere of the room too oppressive. Her heart was sad within her. She hoped still-could hope to the last; but a sickening sensation of doubt and dread almost overpowered her spirit of hopefulness. She walked out into the open air in the hope of overcoming the feeling of despondency she could not divest herself of. 
               In a summer-house near by she saw Hilda and her father's guests seated, and Hilda's children were playing on the lawn. Happy little creatures! too young to feel grief or sorrow. She raised the youngest child in her arms, and kissed it, and talked to it; perhaps hoping to catch something of its joyous spirit; but, in vain. The prattle of the infant now had no charm for her. Its innocent mirth seemed to jar upon her feelings, and the child, usually so fond of her, soon appeared to grow frightened, as if, with quick infantile perception, it had observed that something was wrong. 
               She sat it down on the lawn and turned away, and, with a pettishness unnatural to her, said, 
                
               "Even the child turns from me. I am sent away from my father's bedside; and Hilda, too, can amuse herself with my father's guests, heedless of his sickness, and regardless of my sorrow. I will go to the lodge, and see grandmother Margaret. She will care for me, and comfort me." 
               Margaret Jansen had come to the house at Harcourt's bidding, at the time when the latter went to Tunes to summon the pastor at Louise's request; and had stayed all night, and had called several times since; but within a day or two an attack of rheumatism had confined the old woman to her cottage. 
               It was but a short distance from the chteau, and in an opposite direction from the summer-house. 
               "This," thought Louise, "is well. I shall not intrude my wretchedness on Hilda and her friends," and she hastened away in the direction of the lodge. Like every one else, in these moments of bitter feeling, she was ready to charge her best friends with a heartlessness and want of sympathy to which they were strangers, and-singular perversity of the human heart!-to find a pleasure and relief in so doing. 
               She had been observed by the inmates of the summer-house; indeed she was at that moment the object of their conversation, and of her gentleness and devotion to her father they had been speaking. Harcourt had seen but little of her of late; he had hardly interchanged a word with her for days, yet he had wished to do so, and seeing her walk away alone in an opposite direction he followed, and soon overtook her and, readily perceiving whither she was going, offered to accompany her. 
               She would rather be alone, she said, when first he addressed her; but the words had scarcely escaped her lips when she burst into tears, and exclaimed, 
               "Oh, Herr Henry, I am very miserable!" 
               "But you should not give way to this grief, Mlle. Louise," said the young man. "You, who are always so brave and self-possessed." 
               "What would you have me do?" she replied passionately. 
                
               "My father is sick, and I must not keep watch beside him. Others must take his daughter's place; and Rolf has gone from me. I sought to save him from shame and disgrace, because I knew he was innocent of crime, and he thinks evil of me, and Hilda has not been near me to-day. Leave me, Herr Henry. I wish to be alone, since no one cares for me." 
               "But every body cares for you, Mlle. Louise," replied the young man. "You are not accustomed thus to suspect your friends. You have over-fatigued yourself, and will make yourself ill by so constantly watching at your father's bedside. You shun your friends-not they you." 
               "It is my duty to watch by my father," replied the young girl. 
               "Undoubtedly; still you should regard your own health. I hear that the baron is better this evening?" 
               "Yes, much better," said Louise, appearing to find renewed hope in the expression of the words uttered by another. "Much better," she repeated. "You do not think him dangerously ill; you think he will recover, Herr Henry?" 
               "I sincerely hope so," said the young man, evading a more direct answer. 
               "Oh yes, he will get well," said the young girl; "he is not yet an old man. He will soon grow strong again, and we shall be so happy; and you, Herr Henry, when you go to America, will try and find Rolf, and tell him that I meant no harm; that I did all for the best, and for his and poor Hilda's sake. Dear Hilda, I spoke harshly of her just now. I was wearied and troubled, and knew not what I said." 
               "I will do all you ask, Mlle. Louise," replied the young man, "and I hope that your happiest wishes may be realized." 
               "Thank you, Herr Henry. I know you will, you are so kind always; but do not call me Mademoiselle Louise. Why so with me? It is not Norsk, and I do not like to hear it from my friends." 
               "You will grow accustomed to it," said Harcourt, smiling. 
                
               "Recollect that you are no longer Louise Sigvald, the pilot's orphan child." 
               "Oh, Herr Henry, I wish-no-not that it was so-but that my father had not been so rich and great, and then I should not lose old friends; but you will still call me Louise, Herr Henry?" 
               "If you wish it, Louise," replied the young man. "That is, when we are alone. It must not be when others are present, you know. You will soon learn to accustom yourself to the change in your position." 
               The young girl sighed, but made no reply, and as they had by this time reached the lodge, he entered with her, and after they had made a short stay, returned with her to the chteau, which she was anxious to reach in order to resume her place by the side of her father. 
               As she approached the sick chamber she met the physician and the clergyman. 
               "Can I go into my father's room?" she asked of the latter. 
               "Yes, my child," was the reply. "Our conference is over. It related to matters connected with his estate which he was anxious to settle in case of accident." 
               Something in the tone of the pastor's voice, or in his manner, alarmed Louise. 
               "My father is very ill!" she said. "He is more dangerously ill than I have believed him to be? Tell me, Herr pastor. I am able to bear it. Tell me if you think he will not recover?" 
               "Louise," said the clergyman, taking the hand of the young maiden tenderly within his own, "your father is very ill. Nay, do not tremble so," he continued, as he led her to a sofa. "I have seen you bear up bravely under severe trials. Endeavor to do so now. I feel it my duty to tell you that your father, the baron, is not likely to live many weeks; perhaps not many days." 
               "Is there no hope?" said the maiden, looking appealingly into the clergyman's face, as if she thought that with him rested the fiat of life and death, so long and so implicitly had she been accustomed to trust in him. 
               "The physician who has just left us has declared the baron's case hopeless, my dear child," replied the clergyman. "Your father himself feels it to be so. He has just recorded his will, and you will be his sole heir. I could wish it had been other wise; that, for years to come, you might have lived happy with him, and after that lapse of years, might have smoothed his pathway to the grave, when the allotted span of man's life-the full threescore and ten years-had done their work; but God has willed that this shall not be. Go now to the bedside of your dying father, my dear child, and God give you strength to bear this additional burden He has seen fit to impose upon you." 
               Louise, pale and breathless, had listened to these words without offering to interrupt the pastor; she now rose from her seat and gently disengaging her hand, moved toward the door of the baron's bedroom. She had not shed a tear, but her fixed gaze and quivering nostrils, and compressed, colorless lips, showed how much she felt and how great was the effort she was making to subdue her feelings. The pastor watched her as she advanced along the gallery, with feelings of mingled pity and admiration. 
               "Poor child!" he said to himself; "her young life has of late been strangely checkered with sorrow and trouble, and the one joy she has found to counterbalance them is about to be taken away from her, but she will bear up nobly." 
               However, the young girl had overtasked her sensibilities; before she gained the door of the baron's room, her strength failed her, her head reeled, her steps tottered, and she would have fallen to the floor, had she not been caught in the arms of the clergyman, who led her back to the sofa. She soon recovered herself, and was about to return to her father's bedside, but the pastor observing her nervous agitation, gently led her to his own apartment near by, and there spoke to her soothingly, and though he sought not to deceive her, by raising false hope in her bosom, he endeavored to reconcile her mind to the dispensations of Providence and to induce her to put her trust in God, under whatever circumstances she might be placed and whatever she might be called upon to eudure. 
               Louise listened calmly and patiently to his words for some time, but, at length her fortitude gave way and she burst into tears and wept long and freely. 
               Her Bredell made no endeavor to restrain her tears. He knew that it were better thus, and that when the paroxysm of grief was over, she would be enabled to vist her father and perform the filial duties which had devolved upon her with more composure. 
               In a quarter of an hour he led her to the baron's room. She had dried her tears, though her eyes still showed traces of weeping, and her face was pale; but she walked with a firm step, like one who had made up her mind to perform faithfully a painful and heart-crushing duty. 
               At her own request, she was left alone with her father, the clergyman retiring as soon as he had opened for her the door of the bedroom. 
               The baron smiled when he saw her approaching, and stretched forth his hand. She took the thin, white hand in hers, and bending over her father, kissed his brow, and asked him how he felt. 
               "Better, my child," was the reply. "I am better now," and it was evident to Louise that he was more at ease. The expression of painful anxiety which had rested upon his features had passed away, yet still, as he gazed into his daughter's face, ever and anon there flitted across his countenance an anxious look; but it was a look of anxiety for her now. His mind was more at ease on his own account. 
               His voice was feeble, and it appeared as if speech gave him pain, yet he more than once essayed to speak, and checked himself, as if he dreaded to give utterance to the words which hovered upon his lips. 
               At length he said, "Louise, my child; our re-union, after so many long years of painful separation, on my part, has been of brief duration, and I feel it my quty to tell you, my darling, that I am about to be called away from you. We must soon part to meet no more in this world. I am dying, my child; but were it not that I leave you, so young, so inexperienced, to battle with the world, alone, I should die happy. But He who has hitherto protected you, and raised you up friends, will not forsake you when I am gone." 
               Louise turned aside her head to conceal her emotion, while her father was speaking. She had overrated her strength when she thought, on entering the room, that however deeply she felt she would not betray her grief and thus add to the distress of her dying parent, and unfit herself for the sacred duties she was called upon to perform. But the tears sprang to her eyes again as she listened to her father's words, and coursed slowly down her cheeks. She betrayed now no impetuous burst of grief, such as had overcome her but a short time before, but the silent-and O how much the deeper and more painful grief to bear-which shows itself only in the quivering lip and heaving bosom, and the few scalding tears slowly welling up from the deep fount of sorrow concealed from strangers' eyes. 
               The baron, in spite of her efforts to conceal her emotion, perceived how much she was affected. 
               "I have much to say to you, my child," he said; "but if my words distress you thus, I will refrain from speaking. Yet, I may not have strength to speak again." 
               "No, no; tell me all you have to say, dear father," cried Louise, wiping the tokens of sorrow from her pale face. "Dear father," she repeated as she stooped, and again pressed her lips to his brow, "I know this distresses you-I am weak and foolish. I will strive to listen, and not give way to my feelings again." 
                
               "Before many days, Louise," continued the baron, after a pause, and still speaking with painful effort, yet with the earnestness of one who fears that if now he delays, a future opportunity may never be afforded; "before many days I hope to meet your sainted mother in heaven, and if disembodied spirits are permitted to take an interest in what occurs on earth, together will we watch over you, Louise, my child-our child; and together will we wait and watch to greet you when the hour shall come when your spirit will be summoned from its earthly abode to the blissful mansions above, where grief and sorrow are unknown, and where there shall be no more parting, for ever and ever." 
               Again the baron paused from sheer exhaustion, and his daughter urged him to remain silent for the present and try to sleep, but he shook his head, and presently resumed, 
               "My voice fails me, dear Louise; but I have yet something to mention which I wish you to hear from my own lips. I will not weary you with details, which, perhaps, you could not understand. I have left such matters in the hands of Herr Bredell, who will become your guardian when I am gone; but I would speak to you of Rolf Frode. I can not tell all I could wish. It would take too long, and my strength fails me. But Herr Harcourt will find Rolf, whose true name is Swensen, and it is my dying wish when Rolf is found, and every thing is explained, as it will be-I feel that it will be-that he occupy the position I had hoped to fill-but God has ordered it otherwise-as the protector of my child; of you, my dear Louise. You love Rolf, Louise. I wish Rolf Frode to become your husband. I will not say more now. I am weak and feeble, and will try to sleep. Stay by me, my child. Do not leave me. You will not have to watch long, and when your watch is over, I trust your mother and I will be permitted to watch over you in heaven." 
               The baron ceased speaking, and taking from Louise's hand a potion which his physician had prescribed, soon fell into an easy slumber-and for several hours Louise kept watch over her dying father, often secretly weeping to relieve her-overburdened spirit, but ever cheerful and ready when the moment for action arrived. 
                
               The attack of apoplexy had utterly wrecked the long enfeebled constitution of the baron-yet he lingered for many days-much longer than his physician had thought possible, and several times held earnest converse with his daughter, who was constant in her attendance upon him; but at times his intellect was clouded. He would mistake Louise for his deceased wife, Mary Harcourt, and speak of matters which had occurred a score of years before; and, though generally he recognized Henry Harcourt and the other friends who paid daily visits to the sick room, he sometimes confounded them with others. Every day he grew more feeble; every day his senses became more indistinct. He would fancy that he was again in Paris, newly wedded to her whose memory had been so dearly cherished by him. Sometimes he would address Louise as his long-deceased and still beloved wife, and patiently the poor girl would listen to his feverish ravings, and dissembling her own grief endeavor to restore him to consciousness, without rashly opposing his disordered fancies. One day he imagined that Harcourt was Rolf, returned home, and standing by his bedside, and he raised himself and placed the hand of Louise in that of the young Englishman, and bade the latter cherish and protect his child as he valued the dying blessing of her father, and Harcourt vowed to do so, if Rolf Frode should be heard of no more. 
               The pastor of Tunes was in constant attendance at the bedside of the dying man, and in his lucid intervals held long conversations with him-no longer now having allusions to the past, but to the new existence upon which he was about to enter, and the good clergyman expressed his firm hope and belief that his old and generous patron was passing away from the troubles and trials of this life to a joyous immortality, a humble, faithful Christian. 
                
               Louise watched over her dying father, with so much assiduity, such constant, never-wearying care, that her own health suffered, and her friends began to grow alarmed, but she would listen to no persuasions to relax her attentions. She slept in an adjoining room, where she could hear the slightest noise that issued from her father's apartment, and seldom an hour elapsed between the periods in which she took the repose which nature demanded, and her presence again at his bedside. One day, worn out with fatigue, she slept longer and sounder than usual, and, awaking from her slumber, she hurriedly wrapped her shawl around her, and hastened to resume her post by her father. Some unwonted noise had perhaps awakened her, for when she entered the bedroom she found the valet, whom she had left in charge, fast asleep, and the baron had risen from his bed, and with the almost supernatural strength and energy which oftentimes animate those, however enfeebled they may be, who are dying ere yet the vigor of manhood is exhausted, had partially attired himself in his robes of office, and had seated himself in an easy chair, imagining that he was again in his place on the bench in the Supreme Court of Bergen. Louise was startled, and shocked; but she rushed toward him. 
               "Father, dear father," she cried; "do you know me? Why have you risen from your bed? Let me lead you to bed again." 
               The baron turned toward her a haughty, stern look. The damp of death was on his brow; his features were pinched, and his face wore the pallor of that of a corpse; yet still there was a strange fire in his eye as he gazed upon the maiden, seemingly indignant at an interruption of his imagined judicial duties. It was the ruling passion, strong in death.
                
               "Father, dear father; don't you know me?" repeated the terrified girl, while the valet, who had awakened with the noise, rose from his recumbent posture, and stood as if transfixed with horror and affright. "Don't you know me, dear father?" 
               The unnatural fire in the eyes of the dying man melted away, and his glance of unutterable tenderness rested for a moment upon the face of his daughter. He stretched forth his arms as if to lock her in his embrace; but the rapidly stiffening muscles refused their office. The eyes, which for a moment had flashed with pride, and then had softened their glance into love, glazed and dulled with the film of death. A convulsive shudder agitated his frame, a gurgling, choking sound issued from his throat; for a moment he struggled in mortal agony, and then all was over. He fell back in his chair; his head drooped on his shoulder. One long, vain gasp for breath, and the Baron Von Welden was no more. 
               Louise, unable, with all her fortitude, to endure the horror of this scene, fell in a swoon to the floor, from which she was raised by the scarcely less terrified servant. Assistance was summoned, and the physician and the pastor, and Harcourt, and Staynor, and Hilda Welden, and several servants, soon made their apparance. The baron was carried to the bed, but the physician at once pronounced all efforts to restore animation, vain. *  *  *  *  * 
               A gloom was cast over the district and throughout the city of Bergen in consequence of the death of the baron, who, notwithstanding his reserve and the subdued haughtiness of his demeanor, was universally respected. His funeral, which took place a few days after his death, was attended by all the magnates, and by hundreds of the peasantry of the neighborhood. 
               Herr Bredell had been appointed the temporary guardian of Louise, and the principal executor of the baron's estate, by his will; and in due time the provisions of the will were read by Herr Ballston, the attorney, in the presence of the pastor, the physician, and others interested. It was then discovered that the baron, previous to his last illness, had actually disposed of his landed estate for ready money, with the intention of fulfilling his cherished scheme of emigrating to the United States. The schools which he had established were provided with funds to maintain them in full operation, and money was invested to provide rewards for skill in husbandry, to be distributed annually, as for many years had been the baron's custom. A handsome legacy was left to Pastor Bredell-also to the physician and attorney, as well as to other friends, and all the servants of the deceased. In addition to the estate at Christiania-which was settled upon Hilda Welden, nee Swensen, on behalf of herself and her absent brother, Rolf Frode, nee Swensen-generous provision was made for the children of Hilda, as a feeble attempt at restitution-so said the will-for a crime committed years before. To the Herr Henry Harcourt, "my beloved nephew, but recently known and acknowledged," so also said the will, was bequeathed a handsome sum for the purchase of a token of remembrance; and the residue of the property, still amounting to a considerable amount, was bequeathed to Louise Von Welden, the beloved daughter of the baron; to be held for her benefit by Pastor Bredell, until she attained her twenty-fifth year, or until she married Rolf Swensen. 
               After the reading of the will, Herr Bredell returned to the parsonage at Tunes, taking Louise with him, and leaving the attorney to attend to the sale of the property, which was all to be sold without reserve, except the cottage and land occupied by Christian and Margaret Jansen, and a farm which was bequeathed to Hans Petersen. 
               Harcourt and Staynor paid a brief visit to the parsonage, and then set out for England, with the full resolve to go to America and make every effort to discover Rolf, and if successful, to acquaint Herr Bredell, and Louise and Hilda, with their success. Louise deeply lamented her father's death. She could not entertain the same affection for him, or lament his death so long and so sincerely as she would have done had she grown up from an infant under his care; but all the strength of an affection lain dormant since her birth, and now for the first time awakened, was poured out over the memory of the father she had known but for so short a time, yet had learned so dearly to love. 
                
               Leaving Louise at the habitation of the worthy pastor, and leaving Harcourt and Staynor on their way to England, thence to take shipping for the United States, we will close the present chapter, and resume the thread of our story on the other side the Atlantic. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXX. 
               HALLUCINATIONS. 
               CROWDED ball-rooms and stifling theaters, and weary, dusty walks, and still more weary and dusty drives through the streets and in the environs of a large city, in exchange for the bright, green foliage, and the pure air, and rustling, invigorating breezes of the country, are not the things to bring back the faded roses to the pale cheeks, nor to restore health to the exhausted frame, nor elasticity to the jaded spirits, notwithstanding these specifics are so often resorted to, and so Mrs. Harcourt discovered at the close of a few weeks' stay in New York. Alice continued to grow more languid and dispirited as each successive week progressed; still her mother was unwilling to believe that she had adopted wrong means to restore the young lady's health; still assured, in her own mind, of the infallibility of her system, she kept up the whirl of excitement, and the more strenuously, and often peevishly, urged her daughter to participate in renewed gayeties, when the latter begged for only a few days' repose. Mrs. Harcourt had taken care to let it be known that Alice was an heiress, and the vain mother was gratified with the attentions which were showered upon her child. She believed that the lassitude and lowness of spirits which had now become habitual to Alice, were only the idle whims of a country girl, who, hitherto, both in England and in America, had led a life of too great seclusion from society. Besides, the physicians whom she consulted, in her occasional anxiety-at the same time concealing from the young lady any knowledge that she was the object of medical attention-could not discover that their unconscious patient labored under any physical malady. It was their opinion that the difficulty was of a mental or nervous character, and thus in a great degree they supported the mother in the course she was pursuing, and so Alice might have been dressed, and walked, and driven, and waltzed to her death, were it not that a more potent auxiliary, than her own apparently failing health and drooping spirits, came to her aid, and, eventually, restored her to her uncle Templeton's home. 
               A widow's jointure of two thousand five hundred dollars per annum, paid quarterly, is, as most people will acknowledge-who are not too extravagant in their notions-a very nice thing to possess, in the country, particularly when such expenses as boarding and lodging, and carriage hire, are defrayed by a wealthy and indulgent brother, or other relative, leaving the jointure to be expended in the purchase of those trifling extraneous luxuries which, without wishing to be personal, we must insist have become positive necessities of life with some ladies in this age of refinement-and, shall we add, of extravagance; but when the said two thousand five hundred dollars must needs be expended in providing the thousand and one nameless necessities of fashionable life, in a fashionable residence in an expensive city, this pretty jointure dwindles, in the eyes of the possessor, to a microscopic sum, totally inadequate to a decent maintenance. To be sure, there are many to whom it would appear a magnificent-almost a fabulous income; but these persons are mostly professional men, and tradesmen of limited means and large families, who can not be expected to feel the positive necessity of living in a brown-stone-front mansion, and of luxuriating in all the conventional requirements a position in such a residence demands. "Whatever is, is right"-"sutor ad crepidam;" the hog to his vomit in the mire; the horse to his stable; the children of fashion to the enjoyment of their expensive tastes; the sons of poverty to their daily toil, content in the station to which it has pleased God to call them. 
               We trust the reader will pardon this digression; we have been led inadvertently to indulge in it. Suffice it to say, that Mrs. Harcourt found her income inadequate to the longer indulgence of her expensive city tastes. She applied in vain for temporary assistance from her brother Templeton, on promise of repayment when Alice should come into possession of her fortune. True to his resolve, the bachelor brother and uncle refused to assist his sister in the gratification of her costly indulgences in the city, although whenever applied to, he reiterated his desire that she and Alice would return to Templeton Villa. He was, in a great measure, strengthened in this resolve through the letters he from time to time received from his niece, who always expressed her longing to return home, as she termed it; and, at length, the widow wrote to her brother, informing him that she was about to give up her town residence and return to the villa. Alice, she wrote, she was sorry to mention, had not received much benefit from her residence in the city. The poor child was anxious to go back to the country, and she conceived it to be her duty as a mother to gratify her. The foolish child, she added, was not really ill; but she had taken a ridiculous notion into her head, out of which she had in vain attempted to reason her, and which she feared would affect her mind, if it had not already done so. 
               And Alice wrote a brief letter to her uncle, now that she knew her mother's decision was made, which ran as follows: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "MY DEAR UNCLE-
                            
                           "I am so glad that mamma has consented to leave the city. I do so long to breathe the country air again. I am not really ill; but I am troubled continually with a singular idea, which I can not banish from my mind. Mamma laughs at me; perhaps you will laugh too, when I relate it to you: perhaps it is folly-a mere fancy engendered in my mind, by the whirl of excitement into which I have been thrown since we came to New York. Yet this can hardly be, since it began to haunt me before I left the country. 
                           "We leave New York on Monday, and on Tuesday I hope to see you at the villa. 
                           
                              "Your affectionate niece, 
                              "ALICE."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               And on the designated Tuesday morning, Mr. Templeton drove in his carriage to the stage terminus, a few miles distant from his residence, and welcomed his sister and his niece back to his country home again. 
               Probably had he not been so grieved to find his niece looking so unwell, the old bachelor would have indulged in some pleasantries in relation to the abrupt termination of his sister's visit to the city; but as it was, he said nothing, even in jest, which could give offense. Neither on the day of their arrival at the villa did he make any inquiries regarding their amusements in the city; but on the day following, he took an opportunity of questioning Alice respecting her visit, and asking an explanation of the curious letter she had written him. 
               The uncle and niece were together in the conservatory-a favorite resort of both, and the latter was expressing her delight at finding herself back again among the flowers. 
               "So you did not like New York?" observed Mr. Templeton. 
               "Yes, uncle," was the reply, "well enough for a short time; but for a permanent residence, I certainly prefer the country. I am a country girl, you know. I was born in the country, and mostly resided there when in England." 
               "And have you no relish for balls, and parties, and the opera, and the theaters, and the many entertainments the city affords? Most young women of your age have." 
               "I do not dislike them; they are well enough in their way; but I do not like a continuous round of such amusements, without any rest." 
                
               "Certainly you do not appear to have much benefited in health from your visit." 
               "No," replied Alice. "I am sorry for mamma's sake. She hoped the change would do me so much good. Perhaps, under other circumstances, I might have derived benefit; but-I am, at times, very unhappy, uncle." 
               The old bachelor smiled incredulously, at the commencement of this reply, thinking to himself, doubtless, that his sister's "hope" in regard to her daughter's benefit, was father to the "thought" that she would enjoy the change from country to city life; but noticing the disconsolate tone in which the latter portion was uttered, he said, 
               "Make a confidant of me, Alice, my dear. Tell me what ails you? I could not comprehend the meaning of your last letter. We must have the doctor here to see you; we shall soon bring you round again." 
               "I am not ill, bodily, uncle. I fancy the doctor can do me no good." 
               "Humph!" ejaculated Mr. Templeton, to himself, and looking askance at his niece. "So the doctor can do no good, eh? A case of heart-sickness. The silly girl has fallen in love with some city beau. I guessed how it would be-at her age, too! However, such things will happen, and it is more natural that they should occur in early youth. I was foolish enough to fall in love myself once." 
               "Tell me what does ail you, Alice?" he said, addressing his niece, kindly. "If I can do any thing to help you, I will; that is," he added, with habitual caution, "if I can do so conscientiously." 
               "I fear you can not benefit me, uncle," replied Alice. "Indeed you would perhaps laugh at what I might tell you, and term it, as my mother does, a silly fancy." 
               "Perhaps so," thought the old bachelor. But he again kindly urged his niece to confide her troubles to him. 
                
               After some hesitation, Alice continued:
                     The author disclaims all belief in spiritual agency, or magnetic affinity, as regards such hallucinations as this related by Alice; nevertheless, a case very similar to it actually occurred, under his own observation.
                  
                
               "You know, uncle, that I am not naturally strong, and am, therefore, perhaps prone to indulge in dreamy fancies, such as would by many be deemed foolish. My mother thinks I am foolish in indulging in these. Since you received the letter announcing dear. Henry's loss at sea"-the voice of the young lady saddened and trembled as she spoke-"my spirits have been deeply affected, and though my health has not suffered-I mean that I have no physical disease to which I can give a name-I have not been so strong since as I was before. I loved Henry, dearly. He was my only brother; and though I saw him but seldom, he was always kind and loving toward me when we did meet each other. Clara Withers and I have often talked of him for hours together. Do you think Henry is really dead, uncle?" she suddenly inquired. 
               "I wish I could think otherwise, my dear," answered Mr. Templeton, gravely and sadly; "but the banker's letter from Hamburg spoke authentically. Poor boy! There is no doubt that he embarked for Norway, on board that ill-fated vessel, the Jung Frau, which was certainly lost on the Norwegian coast-I obtained Lloyd's List, purposely, and saw the underwriters' notice. Not a soul on board was saved. Not a plank or spar was recovered. There was nothing ever heard of to give a clew to her loss; besides, if Harry, poor boy, were by any chance saved, he would certainly have written to us ere this." 
               "I suppose there exists no hope of his safety, uncle," continued Alice; "yet, after we heard of the shipwreck, I often dreamed and fancied strange things regarding him. You know how deeply I took the sad affair to heart at first. I used to, see him, in my dreams, washed from the wreck, battling with the waves, and bruised with the broken spars; now struggling boldly to reach a craggy shore, while, terrified, yet hopefully, I watched his progress; then, as if he were overpowered by the force of the waves, or rendered insensible by a blow from some portion of the wreck, I shuddered, speechless with horror, as I saw him borne helplessly toward one of those frightful vortexes which, I have read, abound on the coast of Norway. I never saw a shipwreck, yet I have seen repeatedly all that I have related, as vividly as if I were standing upon some overhanging precipice, and the terrible scene were enacting beneath me. I have tried to scream for succor as I saw him, and him alone of all the wrecked vessel's crew and passengers, tossed to and fro amid the raging billows, and once or twice I awoke mamma, who came to my bedside, fearing I was ill. I told her what I had dreamed. She said I had the nightmare, and bade me compose myself and sleep again. 
               "After a time my dreams took another shape. I saw rude men, in the garb of seamen, launch their boats, and, daring the fury of the storm, go forth to Henry's succor. I have seen him, in my dreams, lying senseless in a rude cabin, on some strange coast, surrounded by strangers, among whom I rushed, and finding that he lived, I turned to thank them for their daring humanity, and, alas! awoke, and found this, too, was but a dream. 
               "Night after night, uncle, I dreamed of poor Henry, sometimes as of one dead, sometimes as of one living and full of health and strength, as when I last saw him alive. My strength wore out under this constant strife with horrid fancies, which rendered sleep unrefreshing to me. 
               "When I went to New York with mamma, I hoped that I should find relief in change of scene; but my hopes were vain. Again my dreaming fancies assumed a different shape. Henry was still their theme; but, now, it was not always struggling hopelessly with the waves, or lying in the seaman's cabin that I saw him. Still my dreams were no less horrible, yet, sometimes, more hopeful. I have seen him in the act of falling from a precipice. I have seen him lying bruised and mangled, apparently ently lifeless, at its base; and I have seen him recovering from his injuries, and sometimes I have seen him perfectly restored to health, and traveling in happy companionship with his friends. 
               "So great an impression did these dreams make upon my mind, that at length they assumed a shape while I was awake. Sometimes at a party, in church, at a place of amusement, these scenes have suddenly appeared before me, as vividly as ever they did in my dreams, to the exclusion of all else. 
               "Only two nights since, while sleeping in the stage, I thought that I was lying on a bed of sickness. I believed that I was dying, and that all my friends were standing, weeping, around me, when suddenly Henry appeared, alive and well, and took me by the hand, and raised me up from my couch, and I arose then as well and happy as he. 
               "I had dreamed this once before, and when I awoke I told mamma; but she was angry with me, and scolded me severely for my folly in indulging myself in such fancies." 
               "Your mother was right, Alice," said Mr. Templeton, "in telling you that you allowed yourself to indulge in foolish fancies, but not in blaming you too severely for so doing. The cause of all these hallucinations is, that you think too much, and too often of poor Henry. Of course, my dear, I can not blame you for having loved your brother, or for mourning his loss; it were unnatural were it otherwise; but it is wrong for the living to brood over the memory of the dead, to such a degree as to injure their own health. I have got you back into the country now, and though the autumn is approaching, and the freshness of summer will shortly have fled, I hope we shall find plenty to amuse us, even when winter itself appears. For my part, I can find pleasure in the country at all seasons. Who was it? ah, Pope, who wrote, 
                     "'God made the country, and man made the town.'
                  
                
               "Well, Pope was a sensible man for writing that line, even if he was open to the epigrammatic couplet of some other poet-I forget who it was just now-which runs: 
                      
                        "'Pope loves the country; but, in truth, must own, 
                        Most loves it when he studies it in town. 
                     
                  
                
               "That I don't believe. Pope wasn't such a simpleton. No man can study the country in town. The idea is a stupid one; besides, Pope had a villa at Twickenham, on the banks of the Thames, and a delightful spot it is. I've visited it many a time. Come, my dear; you must try to reason yourself out of these fancies. You must walk and ride with me, and I'll warrant we shall have you as bright and cheery again as ever." 
               "I have tried, uncle," said Alice, "tried hard, for I know that they are foolish; but I can not. No; they are too vivid; too much like realities. I do not think I shall live long. I am so weak now that I can endure no fatigue, and I can not, foolish though it may be-superstitious as most persons would term it-believe otherwise than that they are a warning to me that I shall soon join Henry in another world." 
               "Pooh! pooh! silly girl. I won't listen to another word of such nonsense," said the old bachelor, though he looked grave, in spite of his effort to ridicule his niece out of her morbid fancies. "Come out in the garden and see my rabbits and guinea-pigs. I've replenished my stock since you went to New York, and then we'll go and feed your old acquaintances, the pea-fowl, before we go indoors to dinner." 
               And Alice accompained her uncle, with assumed cheerfulness, and fed the rabbits and guinea-pigs, and not only renewed her acquaintance with the pea-fowl, but with all the other pets, feathered, biped, and quadruped, which the old bachelor's wellstocked yard and grounds contained. 
               But all the endeavors of Mr. Templeton and his sister, and of Mrs. Jenkins, the ancient housekeeper, and of the rest of the domestics, and of Clara Withers, who spent a great portion of every day with Alice, and of her other friends, to cheer her drooping spirits, were of no avail. She would often steal away from them, and retiring to some secluded part of her uncle's grounds, would seat herself on one of the rustic benches, with which they abounded, and there sit silent for hours, if undisturbed, and gaze up into the sky, or into the placid river, deep in thought; feeling, doubtless, that she must soon quit these scenes for others, unknown; but which she had taught herself to believe-for she had scarcely been taught, except through the words of the Bible-fair as were these, are fairer still to the eye-so immeasurably fairer that man is unable to conceive their beauty; yet, perhaps, not always resigned to the change she anticipated, for separation from all we love on earth, animate or inanimate, is bitter to think of, even to those most hopeful of a bright eternal hereafter; and it is a hard thing to die young, ere yet the earth we live on has unfolded to us half its beauties. 
               Yet she never complained; but brooded silently, and sometimes, perhaps, despairingly, over the fate she appeared to have wrought out for herself-and grief did its work quickly. Not many weeks elapsed, ere, despite of all that medical skill could effect, she was unable to attend to the wants of the garden pets-a task in which she took great delight. She was then carried to the garden to see them fed by others; and soon she could only sit by the open window, and thence witness the performance of the daily duty. 
               The physicians were baffled. There was no visible disease for medical science to grapple with. It was an unaccountable mental hallucination, which was bearing her along on the pathway to the grave. At length the doctors gave up in despair. One of them informed her mother and uncle, that all the physic in the pharmacopia could not save her. 
               "Is there no hope?" asked Mr. Templeton. 
               "None," was the reply; "unless we could find means to cope with the mental disease. If now, it were possible that her brother's life was saved; if she should hear from him, or if he should yet return, even at the last moment, why-then, perhaps-" 
               But Mrs. Harcourt only wept bitterly in reply, and Mr. Templeton shook his head gravely and sadly; and the doctor pressed the hand of the old bachelor, and turned away, for he, all-used as he was to see death approach alike the aged and the youthful, could not bear the idea of his coming in so distressing a shape as this. 
               Every body was kind and loving to the poor, dying child-for she was still but a child. 
               Her uncle had adopted her as his own. Mrs. Jenkins had bestowed upon her the love she had borne to her favorite, Henry. All the servants were eager to do her behests. Thomas would not have complained now, if he had been ordered by Mrs. Harcourt to keep the horses harnessed, and the carriage in readiness all day and night, if by so doing he could have benefited Miss Alice. The gardener would have worked in the garden all day, and in the house all night, to have served the dear young lady, who had been wont to work by his side, and to admire his skill. Every day he brought her, without being requested, the sweetest gift he could bring-a bouquet of the choicest flowers. The families of the neighborhood made daily the most anxious and heartfelt inquiries respecting the welfare of one, so fair, so young, who was so mysteriously departing from among them. Even the dumb brutes and the feathered pets, who had been used to be fed from her hand, seemed to miss her gentle voice and kind smile-for beasts, and birds too, are skillful judges of physiognomy. And-she was the only daughter of her mother! 
               One day-it was not many days after that on which the doctor had described her case as hopeless, though he, the family physician, still paid daily visits to the villa-the fair child lay, as all believed, at the point of death. The house was silent as the grave. The desolation death brings had already entered its portals, for Alice was unconscious, and lay motionless on her couch, as if the cold hand of death had already stricken her. The servants, unbidden, had silently entered the room to see the last of one whom, though they had known her but for so short a time, they had learned to love so well. Mr. Templeton was sitting beside the couch of his niece, gazing upon her with the dry eyes and fixed, penetrating gaze, which seems rather to direct itself inwardly than outwardly, and which betrays the grief too deep for tears. Mrs. Harcourt knelt at the bedside, sobbing violently. Mrs. Jenkins stood near the bed, drowned in grief, moaning, and ever and anon repeating the words, "Both-both-to be taken-and both so young." Clara Withers sat on the opposite side of the couch to Mr. Templeton, holding the thin, white hand of her young friend-the sister of him she had loved, and now mourned. At a short distance from the couch stood the doctor, gazing upon his fair patient with the hopeless, impotent look of one who feels that his best skill is baffled-his science of no avail. All in the room were plunged into the deepest affliction, when a hasty knock was heard at the door. It was unheeded, until it had been repeated. Then one of the servants quietly left the room, and shortly returned with a letter, directed to Mr. Templeton, who, although his attention was more than once called to it, paid no heed to the call. 
               The doctor took it from the servant's hand. 
               "It has the English postmark," he said. 
               "From England!" exclaimed Mr. Templeton, suddenly starting, as if from a state of unconsciousness. "I am expecting no letter now from England." 
               They were the first words he had uttered for at least an hour. He rose and took the letter in his hand. "What, if it were possible," he continued, in a voice of hope, which was yet so hollow in its tones that it made hope itself appear hopeless. "What, if it were possible that dear Alice has divined truly-that Henry still lives? Then?-" He looked inquiringly at the doctor, and pointed to his unconscious niece. 
               The medical man shook his head, but made no reply. 
                
               Mr. Templeton broke the seal. The words he had spoken had raised some vague hope in the hearts of all present, though it was a hope akin to despair. 
               In another moment the letter dropped from his hands; he groaned aloud as, almost falling into his chair, he buried his face in his handkerchief, and cried, 
               "Oh God! This news on such a day as this!" 
               Presently he said, 
               "Read the letter, doctor." 
               It was very brief, a few words only, from the solicitors in London, who had been intrusted with the affairs of the estate of the late William Harcourt. It informed Mr. Templeton that, greatly to their satisfaction, the affairs had been settled a year sooner than they had anticipated, and that the estate was now freed from encumbrance, and awaiting the possession of the heirs of the late proprietor. 
               "Both gone! both gone!" muttered Mrs. Jenkins, and again Mr. Templeton groaned aloud. Mrs. Harcourt sunk senseless to the floor, whence she was borne to a sofa by the servants. 
               Templeton Villa was, on that day, truly a house of mourning. Yet still the day wore on, and evening came in its gloom, and night in its darkness, and she, by whose unconscious form the watchers stood, still lived, though she lay silent and motionless, breathing so faintly that more than once it was thought that her spirit had flown; and still unconscious, and motionless, and breathing as faintly, she lay another, and another, and yet another day. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXXI. 
               A TRIP TO NEW YORK. 
               "WHEN does the Franklin leave the London Dock?" inquired a young man of the book-keeper of a commercial shipping agent, some three weeks, or thereabouts, after the occurrence of the events recorded toward the close of the twenty-ninth chapter, whence we left Louise Von Welden at the parsonage of Tunes, and mentioned the departure from Bergen of Harcourt and Staynor. 
               "The Franklin left the dock this morning at daybreak, sir, and dropped down the river with the tide. She has her pilot on board, and as the wind will be in her favor when she reaches the North Foreland, she will probably be well down channel before to-morrow morning," was the prompt reply. 
               "That is unfortunate," answered the young man, addressing a companion who stood near him; then, again, to the clerk, 
               "We hoped to reach London in time to take passage on board the ship for New York. I know she was advertised to sail to-day; but hardly thought she would have been so true to her time. Is there no possibility of our overtaking her?" 
               "Our vessels always sail on the day advertised," answered the clerk. "You can not overtake the Franklin, unless you take the stage to night for Southampton, where she will touch for passengers; but the Madison-one of the same line-is now in the dock, and will sail the day after to-morrow. She has quite as good accommodations, and several berths disengaged." 
               "We have particular reasons for wishing to take passage on board the Franklin," said the young man. "Has she any berths not taken?" 
               "Four, if not five," replied the clerk, referring to an order-book. 
               "Then we will take two berths, at once, if you please, and start for Southampton to-night." 
               The necessary business was soon transacted, and the young man and his friend left the counting-house of the shipping commission-agent, and proceeded in the direction of the stage-office. 
               "This is unfortunate," said Harcourt, for, as the reader will have suspected, the inquirers at the agent's were our two Norwegian travelers. 
               "Not so unfortunate, since we can overtake the vessel at Southampton," replied Staynor. "I consider that we have been lucky in so soon finding Rolf." 
               "That is, if he be really on board the vessel." 
               "If me no ifs," said Staynor. "You are always fearing or anticipating difficulties. Now I take things after another fashion. I make sure of my clew, follow it up, anticipating no difficulty, and generally find that by so doing I get along quite easily." 
               "Yes; but are you sure of your clew?" 
               "Certainly. While you were hunting up your mother and sister, only to discover that, after all, as you yourself suspected beforehand, they sailed for America, months ago, I remained at Hull until I found out, after some little trouble, the agent to whom the vessel which left Bergen for that port, on the day of Rolf's sudden flight, was consigned, discovered that he arrived at Hull on board the vessel, and shipped on board a collier for London-made four voyages between Hull and London, and then left the ship. I then came up to London, and visited the owners of the collier in this city, learned from them that a Norwegian sailor, named Rolf Frode, had been paid off at a certain date from one of their brigs, and down I went to the brig, which happened to be lying off the Tower. There I found the skipper and mate, and the latter informed where the boardinghouse was situated in which Rolf had boarded after he left the collier. Off to the boarding-house I went, like a shot, saw the proprietor, and learned from him that a sailor named Rolf Frode had shipped on board a Bristol trader about a fortnight before, and that he believed he intended to go thence to Liverpool, with a view of shipping himself on board some vessel bound to America. This was a damper; but away I started for Bristol, arrived there, and found out that Rolf had not left the vessel, but had returned with her to London. Back to London again. The trader had not arrived, but was expected daily. A brief respite. I had my man, safely secured on board a coaster, and coming toward me, instead of my gallivanting over the country to find him. Then I took a trip to Rye to meet you, and on my return with you, the next day, found that the vessel had arrived sooner than had been anticipated, and that Rolf, on being paid off, had immediately shipped on board the American ship Franklin, bound for New York. The very thing, as we both intended to visit the United States, only we have permitted the ship to give us the slip-that's rhyme, though I didn't mean it as such; but I suppose that poetry, like reading and writing, as honest Dogbery hath it, comes by nature-through going to the opera last night, and oversleeping ourselves this morning. Now confess, Harry, that when my good, worthy second cousin-whom heaven assoil-left me two thousand pounds a year, he spoiled a very pretty detective officer?" 
               "Who allowed his man to escape at the moment he had his hand upon him," said Harcourt. 
               "Not at all, my dear fellow; I have only boxed him up snugly, and shipped him off to Southampton, where I shall find him safe. I should have gone with him there myself, if I had not blundered by taking you into partnership." 
               "Well, you have done pretty fairly," said Harcourt. "I only hope we shall find him on board the Franklin." 
                
               "No doubt of that," replied Staynor, as the young men entered the stage-office together. 
               Six o'clock of that evening found the two friends seated outside the Southampton mail-stage, behind the coachman. They were the only occupants of the seat, and therefore had an opportunity to converse freely without interruption. 
               "If Rolf will be astonished to see us as passengers on board the Franklin, Harry," observed Staynor, "how much greater will be the astonishment of your mother and sister, to see you present yourself in bodily presence before them." 
               "I hope they'll receive my letter before I arrive in New York," replied Harcourt. 
               "When did you post it?" 
               "A week ago." 
               "I don't believe any vessel has sailed for New York for a week." 
               "Nonsense, Charley; vessels sail for New York almost every day." 
               "Supposing they do. A trifling change of wind; the slightest difference in point of speed in sailing; a score of accidents, may detain your letter until a week, perhaps a fortnight after the Franklin's arrival in port." 
               "I hope not, Charley; but if it should be so, it can't be helped." 
               "Not now; but, Harry, how wrong it is in you not to have written before. I have often urged you; and now you have learned that your friends heard the news of your supposed death by shipwreck, months ago." 
               "I have done very wrong, Charley," said Harcourt, in a penitent voice. 
               "Very wrong! Indeed you have. You don't deserve your good fortune. Only a week since, you tell me, your uncle's solicitors wrote to inform him of the unexpectedly early settlement of your late father's affairs, and that his heirs could take immediate possession. You ought to have been drowned, and your sister ought to have the estate, that's poz." 
                
               "Very kind in you," replied Harcourt. 
               "Very kind in you, to throw your mother and sister into mourning for such a scamp. However, we won't quarrel over the matter. What's done can't be helped. By the way, how old is your sister, Harry?" 
               "About seventeen." 
               "Humph! You have told me she is pretty: does she resemble you?" 
               "Very little." 
               "I don't suppose she does, if she be really pretty." 
               "Why, then, did you ask the question?" 
               "O, just to see how far your vanity would carry you, that's all." 
               "Well, then, she is not at all like me. She is really a very pretty and a very delicate girl; and a very good girl, too." 
               "Then she certainly does not at all resemble you-not in a single point. Is she really fond of you?" 
               "I believe Alice, dear girl, loves me as much as ever sister loved a brother." 
               "Harry, I am half inclined to pitch into you, and knock you off the coach-box. Upon my soul-I repeat my words-you ought to have been drowned. You have richly merited such a fate." 
               "Breaking my neck would answer the purpose as well," said Harcourt, good-humordly; "and you could effect that by pitching into me, and knocking me off the coach-box." 
               "And put my neck into a halter for such a fellow as you," replied Staynor. "However, I might escape to America, and I should do an act of justice and gallantry, by putting your sister into the possession of your father's estate." 
               "And then?" 
               "Then I'd marry her." 
               "She wouldn't have you." 
               "Why not, pray?" 
               "Because you are neither pretty nor good," replied Harcourt. 
               "Fairly hit, Harry," said Staynor; "but, truly, I'm getting tired of knocking about the world, in the scape-grace way I have been, for two or three years past, and acting Mentor to such precious Telemachuses as you. I'm nearly twenty-five. Once I thought I never would marry; but now that I am growing old, I begin to feel the necessity of getting somebody to take care of me, and of leaving such young scamps as you to take care of yourselves." 
               "Well, Charley," replied Harcourt, speaking seriously, and taking his friend's hand, "there is no one living I would sooner have for a brother-in-law than you, and I believe you know it." 
               "I know that you are my friend, Harry," said Staynor; "but," he added, bursting into a loud laugh, "what silly boys we are making of ourselves." 
               "In what respect?" 
               "In talking seriously of marriage, that is to say, of my marrying your sister, whom I have never seen, and who, when she sees me, may think me an ogre." 
               "She will know that you are her brother's best friend," replied Harcourt, still speaking in a serious tone. "Strange things happen sometimes, Charley, and, as the proverb says, 'What is spoken in jest, often happens in earnest.'" 
               "Well, under those circumstances," said Staynor, smiling, "I'll go to sleep and dream the matter over, for the jolting of the coach has made me feel drowsy; that is, if I can prop myself up so as not to fall off this confoundedly rickety seat, and break my neck, which would prove rather an unpleasant interruption of such a dream as I purpose to enjoy." 
               By raising the cushions over the railing of the seat, and placing their carpet-bags beneath, they, after some trouble, succeeded in making a protection against accident, and Harcourt, promising his companion to keep watch that he didn't fall off, the latter was soon fast asleep, and Harcourt himself, notwithstanding his promise, soon fell asleep likewise, nor did they awaken until they were aroused by the noise of the coach wheels rattling over the stones of Southampton. 
                
               It was daylight when the stage drew up in the inn-yard. They alighted from their elevated place of repose, somewhat cramped and chilled, but little the worse for their long nap in the night air, and learning, upon inquiry, that the Franklin had not yet arrived at the port, they ordered breakfast, and washed themselves, and changed their traveling garments; and after partaking of the meal provided for them, sallied forth to inspect the town. 
               The Franklin did not reach Southampton until the following morning, when the young men went on board with their luggage, and presenting their credentials to the captain were received as passengers. 
               It had been their intention to tell the captain Rolf's singular history, and, if possible, to induce him to permit the young Norwegian to return immediately to his native land-if they could persuade the latter to do so, of which they thought there was little doubt; but the vessel remained off the port but a few hours, and every thing on board was in such a state of confusion that they found it impossible to gain the captain's ear, and although the mate, after some time, condescended to point out Rolf to them, he was aloft, bending on a new top-gallant sail. He did not recognize them, and they could find no opportunity of speaking to him for several hours. 
               Rolf's surprise on finding his late companions in the unfortunate trip to the Hardanger Fjeld, may be better conceived than described, and his astonishment when he heard related the singular series of events which had led to the discovery of his origin, after the trial at Bergen, was greater still. It was long before he could credit the details, but the evident seriousness and earnestness of the young Englishmen finally convinced him that they were telling the truth. When at length they spoke of Louise, and of her mingled good and bad fortune, he became greatly agitated; and when they spoke of her purity and truth, and of her grief at his departure, and of her willingness, nay, her anxiety, to forgive his cruel and ungrateful conduct toward her, it was evident that pride and jealousy, and bitterness of feeling, on account of the degradation to which he had been exposed, rather than doubt of her truth, or diminution in his love, had led him to forsake her and his native land at the moment when-though unknown to himself-such fair and unexpected prospects were about to open to him. 
               Duty at length called him away, and broke up the conference; but he left them to attend the call of duty deeply affected. He confessed that he regretted that he had left Louise; that he loved her deeply and sincerely, and the more tenderly at the moment when he set foot on board the brig which had borne him away from the shores of Norway, than ever he had loved her before; he acknowledged that he had acted with ingratitude, nay, with baseness; he vowed that, if he lived, he would see Louise again, and beg her forgiveness, and thank her for her love and devotion, and said that he had never credited the story told him by Carl Jansen-still it had, at the moment, added fresh fuel to the flame of conflicting and devouring passions which was burning within him; but, he said, determinedly that he would never again reside in Bergen. 
               Some days elapsed before the captain of the vessel heard the story. He expressed great surprise, and said that had he known the facts when at Southampton, he would willingly have permitted Rolf to go ashore, and would have procured another seaman in his stead; but Rolf was an excellent and active sailor; his services during the passage would be greatly needed, and he could not allow any relaxation of the young Norwegian's duties. This, in fact, was not to be expected, nor would Rolf himself have consented to any such favor had it been offered. He continued to perform with cheerfulness and alacrity his allotted duties, though in his hours of leisure one rule of the ship was infringed in his favor: he was permitted to converse with Harcourt and Staynor, and the other passengers, to whom his strange story became known. It was a rule that no sailor should be permitted to converse with the passengers. 
                
               And so the good ship Franklin sped her way over the pathless track of ocean until six long weeks had passed by, and one morning the gratifying cry of "Land" was heard from aloft, and the passengers rushed upon deck, and gazed upon the dim outline of the shore, with a greediness of vision that can not be conceived by those who have not for weeks made a ship their home, and, day after day, week after week, found nothing for the eye to rest its weary gaze upon but the wide expanse of ocean bounded by the distant horizon, upon which rested the blue, arched canopy of heaven, save when, occasionally, an ark peopled with ocean wanderers, such as themselves, crossed their course, or appeared dim and shadowy in the distance; or when the finny denizens of the ocean rose to the surface of the water from the depths of their gloomy, dark, unfathomable abode, and, lured by the brightness of the sun, disported themselves in the warmth of his rays. 
               Soon the faint, gray outline, which the sailors hailed as the land, was visible from the decks, and ere long, even to the eye of the landsmen on board, it assumed a shape, and vessels began to crowd upon their vision, and one tiny boat, launched from the deck of a small sloop with a cabalistic number painted in black upon its snow-white sail, drew near, and from the boat a man climbed the huge ship's side, and the pilot sprang on board; and now the ship drew nearer the land, and soon green fields, and white cottages, and forest trees, and tall church spires, made the lately shapeless gray outline, which the sailors had called land, pleasant to behold; and now the good ship entered a beautiful and spacious bay, dotted with charming islands which might well be fairy abodes, and sheltered by verdant shores, upon which villages and farm-houses clustered, and from which huge, grim forts and fortifications seemed to grin defiance, with their black, metallic teeth, upon those who should dare to enter the beautiful bay, with hostile purpose intent, and to promise security and protection to those who came to pursue the peaceful purposes of commerce; and then more ships-and more, until a crowd of tall masts and spars, rising and spreading-like forest trees, denuded of their foliage by the frosts of winter-from the black hulls, which lined the wharves and piers of a far-stretching city-proudest emblems of its wealth; and the rattling of a heavy chain was heard, and the huge anchor dropped with a loud plash into the stream, and the ships swung round to the wind and tide; and the busy hum of labor resounding from the city filled the air; and then the ship's sails were furled, and boats put off from the vessel to the shore, and the passengers were landed in safety in the mighty capital of the western hemisphere. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXXII. 
               NEW YORK-THE TRANCE-OLD ACQUAINTANCES. 
               "IN the United States, at last," observed Harcourt to his friend, as soon as they set foot on shore near the Battery. "Oh, the wretched six weeks that we have been cooped up on board that horrid ship! Talk of the pleasures and joviality of a sailor's life! Joviality, indeed! It's all nonsense. Doctor Johnson was a sententious old fellow; but he said and did many wise things, and never spoke more wisely than when he observed, that he could not conceive how any man of sense could go to sea, or something to that purpose." 
               Staynor smiled. 
               "I," said he, "am as glad to be ashore again as you can be. Still, I always strive to make myself as comfortable as possible, under whatever circumstances I find myself placed, and I generally do make myself tolerably happy. I have passed many happy hours on board the Franklin. But, now we are here, I suppose you will start off at once for your uncle's residence, and postpone lion-hunting in the city until some future period?" 
               "I don't know whether it would not be better to write, and let my uncle know that we have arrived," replied Harcourt. 
               "Vacillating, as usual, Harry. You did write from London; the letter may, or may not have arrived. Now you are here, let there be no further delay. Still, write if you please; drop a letter in the post-office to-night, and start for Troy yourself at the same time, and run a race with it, as we have, in fact, been doing with the letter you wrote from London. You ought to have written months ago; but, since you did not, there is little use in writing now. Present yourself in propria person, like a man, and express your sorrow for your past neglect. I warrant they will be so glad to see you that you won't get half the scolding you merit." And Harcourt took his friend's advice, and that evening they started in the stage for Troy, near which city Mr. Templeton's residence was situated. 
               Rolf, who, actuated by a fit of spleen, had made a fool's trip across the Atlantic, by the advice of his friends, left the Franklin, and embarked on board a ship bound to Liverpool, which was to sail on the following day; but he told the young men, when he bade them good-by, that if they remained in the United States six months, they would see him back again, "and," added the honest fellow, with, however, a little hesitation in his voice, "I hope Louise, and my sister and her children will be with me." *  *  * 
               Templeton Villa remained still a house of mourning. For nearly five days and nights Alice had lain in a species of trance. More than once, for hours together, her breathing was imperceptible, and her friends thought she was dead; but her limbs did not stiffen, nor her features change; neither did the warmth of life leave her body; and after each of these seeming suspensions of the vital functions, a slight perspiration broke out at every pore, and a moisture was again observable on the hand-mirror that was held to her lips. Once or twice those who watched over her fancied that her lips moved, and that she smiled; but if such were the case, the motion was so faint, the smile so nearly imperceptible, that they doubted whether they were not mistaken. 
               A terrible suspense preyed upon the minds of all the inmates of the house. It was a suspense frightful to endure; enough to drive them to insanity. They could have gazed upon the lifeless form of the beloved object of their tender solicitude with more courage than they could linger around the couch upon which she lay in this condition-a living body, as it were, without a soul! 
                
               Mrs. Harcourt was carried from the room at the close of the second day, and not again permitted to enter it. Her friends feared that her mind had already given way beneath the weight of her affliction. 
               Mrs. Jenkins and Clara Withers were constant in their attendance upon the sufferer, if such she could be called, who seemed already to be beyond all earthly suffering! Clara had not left the villa since Alice sunk into this unconscious condition. She and Mrs. Jenkins relieved each other in their watch at the bedside, when it became necessary for either to take the repose which nature demanded, and the latter, when her young companion was sleeping, often knelt, and prayed earnestly that God would withhold His mysterious visitation, and restore her gentle Alice to consciousness, even if it were to suffering, or, in mercy, take her to Himself. Once, while thus engaged in prayer, she heard, or fancied she heard, a faint moan. She listened, and it was repeated, and followed by a rustling of the bedclothes. With a shrill cry, which awoke Clara, and brought Mr. Templetion, who slept in the adjoining apartment, into the room, she sprang from her knees. To their anxious inquiries into the cause of her alarm, she told what she had heard; but when they looked at Alice, she lay in the same state; not a limb had changed its position; not a fold of the bedclothes was disturbed; partly on her side, with her cheek resting upon one hand, with the other hand and arm carelessly extended outside the counterpane, she lay motionless-apparently breathless, with her lips slightly parted-dead as might well be imagined, yet with a faint flush upon her cheek, and her skin as soft and warm as if she were in perfect health. 
               At another time, when Clara was seated beside the bed, and, for a few moments, wearied out with constant watchfulness, had closed her eyes, while Mrs. Jenkins lay sleeping upon the sofa, she started from her chair with an exclamation of surprise and alarm which aroused the old lady, and declared that she had heard the bedclothes stirring and her own name twice distinctly uttered; but, apparantly, Alice had not moved. She lay in exactly the position in which she had been placed several hours before. 
               The two females cast a strange, frightened look at each other. Were their own senses failing them? It was dreadful-terrible! Mrs. Jenkins did not again lie down. Through the long, still, dark hours of night, until day dawned, she sat beside the bed, with Clara; both wakeful, watchful, often exchanging covert glances, but afraid to speak. 
               Mr. Templeton was almost worn out with grief and anxiety A single week seemed to have added years to his life. 
               The servants moved about the house and even about the garden, with quiet, stealthy tread, and spoke in whispers, as a mother would move and speak in a room in which her infant lay sleeping. 
               The physicians who had been summoned from New York, to assist the medical adviser of the family, could make nothing of the case-could effect nothing. They were like men with their hands tied. Skill and science were alike baffled. It was a case of syncope, said one; of trance, said another; of catalepsy, developed in a peculiar and rare manner, said a third; while the faculty at a distance, for the case had got into the newspapers, far and near, were equally divided in their opinions and equally at fault. Some thought the afflicted one would linger thus, perhaps, for weeks, ere she died; others, that she might recover. Even the attendant physicians were divided on this point. While one believed that recovery was out of the question; another thought it might be possible; and the third, that she not only might recover, but might enjoy better health in future than she had ever before enjoyed. There was some reason for this opinion, for, strange as it may seem, although the patient had taken no nourishment since she had fallen into this lethargic state, she appeared to the cursory observer to be its better health than she had been for weeks. The hectic flush-the seal of consumption-had left her cheeks, and the soft bloom that now rested upon them was, seemingly, that of health, the thin arms and transparent hands appeared to be rounder, and even to have gained in flesh, and the clammy perspiration which, during the first day of the seizure, had occasionally broken out, and then been succeeded by a harsh dryness of skin, had disappeared and a warm glow rested upon the face, and arms, and hands, such as would indicate perfect health. It was not until observing the patient more narrowly, the eye was shocked to discover that no gentle breathing disturbed the bedclothes, or dilated the nostrils, that the idea presented itself, that one was looking upon a piece of waxwork, marvelously truthful to nature and representing the face, and hands, and arms of a corpse. 
               It was a mystery which no one could understand. Even the residents of the neighborhood, and the country people whose avocations led them to pass near the house, gazed upon it with looks of mingled curiosity and awe, as they would have gazed upon a haunted castle. 
               Toward the afternoon of the fifth day, two young men alighted from a carriage, a short distance from the villa, and directing the driver to remain stationary until he was signalized to approach with their baggage wended their way on foot toward the gate which opened upon the carriage-way leading to the house. 
               "We will walk to the gate together," said the younger of the two, to his companion, "and then you wait there, while I go? up to the house and announce myself. If I do not call to you, you had better make your appearance in the course of a few minutes, and I will introduce you. You see, I may forget to call you, in the agitation that I shall certainly feel on meeting my mother and sister, after so long an absence, and under such circumstances." 
               "So be it," returned the older of the young men, "only I stipulate that you don't keep me waiting too long. I am anxious to see this paragon of a sister of yours. And mind," he jokingly added, "don't forget, if you do condescend to think of me, after having greeted your friends, to speak a preliminary good word in my favor." 
               "Be sure of that," was the reply, as the young men parted at the gate and the first speaker advanced toward the front door of the villa, alone. 
               At a short distance from the house he encountered the gardener. 
               "It were, perhaps, better that I ask this man to call my uncle outside, and after he has recognized me, get him to break the shock my sudden appearance will occasion, to my mother and sister," thought the young man; and going toward the man he asked if Mr. Templeton lived there. 
               "Yes, sir," was the reply. 
               "Will you tell him that a gentleman from England wishes to see him?" 
               "Yes, sir; but-he is very unwell, sir. There is sickness in the house." 
               "Sickness! Is Mr. Templeton ill?" 
               "Mr. Templeton is not exactly sick, himself, sir; but-" 
               "Surely not Mrs. Harcourt? She is residing here?" 
               "Yes, sir. Mrs. Harcourt is badly, sir; but it was Miss Alice I was speaking of." 
               "Good heavens!" exclaimed the young man, covering his face with his hands, and speaking in a tone of anguish that frightened the gardener. "For God's sake ask Mr. Templeton to come here immediately. Tell him I am the bearer of news-of important news from England." 
               The gardener went into the house, and presently Mr. Templeton made his appearance, looking so haggard, and worn, and distracted-looking that his nephew scarcely recognized him. 
               He advanced toward the young man and said, looking vacantly at him, 
               "You wish to speak to me, sir?" 
               "Uncle," said the youth, "do you not know me? I am your nephew, Henry Harcourt." 
                
               Mr. Templeton started and retreated a few paces, holding up his hands, spread open, as if to shut out some repulsive or frightful object from his sight. 
               "Uncle! uncle!" exclaimed Henry. "Do you not know me?" 
               "Go, go!" exclaimed Mr. Templeton, waving his nephew away with one hand, and pressing the other to his brow, and still retreating backward. "What is the meaning of this? What evil is this which has befallen my house?" 
               "Uncle, I am indeed your nephew, Henry Harcourt." 
               "No, no," said Mr. Templeton, "my nephew was drowned at sea, months ago." 
               "No, uncle, I am he. I alone was saved of the crew and passengers of the Jung Frau. I am Henry Harcourt," repeated the youth. "Uncle, have you received no letter from England lately, nor from New York?" 
               A packet of letters had arrived that morning, which had none of them been opened, and this Mr. Templeton recollected; also, that one of these letters bore the London postmark. 
               "It is Henry's voice, and form, and face," said Mr. Templeton, talking to himself. 
               "It is I, myself, uncle. I ought to have written to you; but I did not think you would ever hear of the loss of the vessel, on board of which I embarked for Norway from Hamburg." 
               Mr. Templeton had by this time, in some degree, recovered from the fright and confusion into which he had been thrown, when, as he imagined, he had either lost his wits, or his nephew's wraith stood before him. 
               "It is Henry," he exclaimed, as, advancing to the young man, he seized his outstretched hand. "O, Henry, Henry!" he exclaimed, "would to God you had written, and the evil that has been brought upon us might have been spared. Come with me into the house, and I will tell you all." 
               "My mother and sister, sir?" said the young man, inquiringly. 
                
               "They are ill, Henry; very ill, I can not explain to you here-come in. You must not see them now. Henry, I fear your sister is dying." 
               The horror-stricken youth followed the enfeebled steps of his uncle into the house, and there listened with dismay and bitter self-upbraiding to the sad tale he had to tell. 
               "Can I not see my sister and mother?" he asked, his eyes filled with tears, and his voice trembling with agitation. 
               "Not until I have broken to your mother the news of your return," said Mr. Templeton. "I hope all is for the best; but I dread the effects of the intelligence. I am scarcely in a fitting state myself to break the news. Wait here; wait here, until I return. God bless you, my boy, God bless you; but you ought to have written." 
               The feelings of the young man can be better imagined than described, as he waited for his uncle's return from the painful errand he had undertaken, an errand which should have been one of joy. 
               Meanwhile Staynor, who had waited impatiently at the gate for the expected signal from Harcourt, grew weary, and believing himself to be forgotten, entered the grounds, and approached toward the house. 
               He was met by the gardener, as Harcourt had been, and the man asked what he wanted. 
               "A gentleman, Mr. Henry Harcourt, entered the house, half an hour since?" he said. 
               "Yes, sir; a gentleman asked to speak with Mr. Templeton. He is in the house, sir. There is sickness in the house, sir; Mrs. Harcourt is very ill, and Miss Alice is dying. Do you wish to see Mr. Templeton, sir;" 
               "No, no," said Staynor, staggered at the information he had received, "I will remain here until Mr. Harcourt comes out. He is a friend of mine. I will walk into the summer-house and wait there, and rest myself, if you will allow me." 
               "Yes, sir, certainly," replied the man. 
               "Oh Henry, Henry!" said Staynor, as he walked away in the direction of the summer-house, "you are suffering now the bitter fruits of your thoughtlessness!" 
               Overwhelmed with sorrow, and wishing that he had been lost with his ill-fated companions on board the Jung Frau, Henry waited a long half hour, which seemed to him an age, before his uncle reappeared. At length he re-entered the room. 
               "You can go with me into your mother's room, Henry," said Mr. Templeton. "You will find her very weak; but I have prepared her to receive you," and the young man, his head throbbing, and his heart sinking within his bosom, followed, with a faltering step, almost as feeble as that of his old uncle, who was wearied by days of anxiety and care, and nights of sleeplessness. 
               We will pass over the meeting between the mother and son, so long separated, and reunited under circumstances of such a painful nature. It is enough to say that Mrs. Harcourt, weakened and enfeebled in mind and body-but lately recovered from the temporary aberration of mind brought on by witnessing her daughter's fearful condition which had led to her being removed from the sick chamber and forbidden to re-enter it, lest the consequences might be fatal-received her son with a burst of maternal love such as he had never before known her to exhibit. She did not chide him for his neglect: she scarcely made any allusion to the past. The only words she uttered, as she pressed the young man to her bosom, were, "Henry, Henry, my son, why did you not write and let us know that you were living, and this sorrow might have been spared us-" Her sobs choked her utterance, and she hung upon the young man's neck, and gave free vent to her grief. The return of Henry Harcourt was the best thing that could have happened, much as Mr. Templeton had dreaded the interview. His mother's reason was tottering on its throne, and this exciting event roused her from the lethargy into which she was fast falling, and restored its equilibrium. 
               Mr. Templeton, who, after leading his nephew into the presence ence of Mrs. Harcourt, had left them together in the apartment, was met, on his return to his own room, by Clara Withers, who, trembling with excitement, besought him to accompany her into Alice's chamber. 
               "Great God!" exclaimed Mr. Templeton, alarmed by the appearance of the young lady. "What is the matter, Miss Withers? Alice is not-"He could not finish the sentence; but Clara interpreted its meaning, and returned her answer. 
               "No, sir; she is not dead; she has awakened from her trance, and has spoken, though incoherently." 
               An exclamation of joy and gratitude was upon Mr. Templeton's lips; but he glanced at the visage of his fair conductress, and checked its utterance. Clara appeared completely awe-stricken. They entered the bedroom together. 
               Alice had not only spoken, but had risen unaided, from the recumbent posture she had maintained for days. She was seated upright in bed; her body, perfectly rigid, rested its weight upon her left arm, which was stretched to its utmost tension, and her right arm was extended forward, the fore finger of the hand pointing toward some unknown object. Her lips were parted like those of a person about to speak, and her eyes were wide open and fixed, gazing intently in the direction of the extended finger; but their expression was that of surprise and anxiety, blended with a vacancy which produced an awful effect, and terrified the beholders. 
               Mrs. Jenkins stood trembling by the bedside, now, for the first time since Alice's illness, unable to exercise her judgment. The family physician, who was present, was endeavoring, with the exertion of no little force, to relax the muscles of the extended arm, but, in vain, and at length he desisted. 
               "What is this?" said Mr. Templeton, when he found his tongue, after having made several futile efforts to speak. 
               "Catalepsy," whispered the physician, in his ear. 
               "But you said she had spoken," continued Mr. Templeton, addressing himself to Clara. "What did she say?" 
                
               "She shrieked out her brother's name, and, springing up from the bed, stretched out her arm, and remained in the rigid posture you now behold her," said the physician, answering the question Mr. Templeton had put to Clara, who was too much agitated to reply herself. 
               Mr. Templeton stood for some moments silent and bewildered. At length he beckoned the physician aside; but before he had time to speak, Alice said softly, 
               "Yes; it is he, Henry, my brother!" the muscles of the extended arm relaxed as well as those of the left arm which had supported her body in its erect posture, and before Mrs. Jenkins could interpose her own arm to support her, she fell back upon the pillow. 
               "She is dead!" cried both Clara and Mrs. Jenkins in a breath. Mr. Templeton and the doctor returned in haste to the bedside, and the latter raised the hand of the sufferer and felt her pulse. 
               "Is it so, doctor?" whispered Mr. Templeton. 
               "No," was the reply; "the pulse beats feebly, but regularly." 
               All present drew a long breath, as if relieved from some overwhelming apprehension: and now the breathing of the fair sufferer was apparent, for the first time for many days. It was feeble, but not spasmodic, and her bosom rose and fell gently and regularly, as if she were sleeping in perfect health. 
               "She will live?" whispered Mr. Templeton, inquiringly. 
               "I hope so; I think so," was the reply. "The fit has passed away; but the greatest care and attention must be bestowed upon her. She will, perhaps, sleep for hours; the longer the better. Let the strictest silence be maintained, and let every person leave the room except Mrs. Jenkins and this young lady, if she will remain, I wish that when she wakes, she may see no one about her but those to whom she has been accustomed, and with whom she has been familiar. When she wakes call me immediately." 
                
               Clara signified, by a motion of the head, her willingness to remain with Mrs. Jenkins, and Mr. Templeton and the doctor stepped noiselessly from the apartment, closing the door, softly, behind them. 
               "You believe there is hope, doctor?" said Mr. Templeton, after the two gentlemen had walked in silence to the end of the passage. 
               "Much depends upon the condition in which she may awaken from her present slumber," replied the physician. "If she wake in a state of consciousness, I shall have great hope of her ultimate recovery, although she is in a condition of utter physical exhaustion. If not, I fear her case is hopeless." 
               "It is a singular case, doctor," said Mr. Templeton. 
               "Most singular. I have, it is true, heard of one or two such cases; but this is the first that has fallen under my own observation." 
               "There is yet an additional mystery connected with it," continued Mr. Templeton. "You know, doctor, the supposed cause of Alice's malady?" 
               "Yes. Some singular mental hallucination, in connection with her brother's death." 
               "Exactly so. Henry is living!" 
               The doctor started. He had heard the particulars relating to the supposed loss of young Harcourt, at sea; and he began to fear that the mind of Mr. Templeton was wandering. 
               "Henry Harcourt is living," repeated Mr. Templeton, noticing the doctor's surprise. "He has arrived from Europe, and is now in this house." 
               The doctor made no reply; but his pitying look betrayed his feelings. 
               "You think my reason is affected, doctor," said Mr. Templeton. "It is not so. If you will accompany me to Mrs. Harcourt's room, you will find Henry there." 
               The physician followed Mr. Templeton, shaking his head and compressing his lips, no longer doubting that the recent anxiety and excitement his friend had suffered had affected his intellect; but a tap at the door of the room was answered by a young man, whom Mr. Templeton introduced to the doctor as his nephew, Henry Harcourt. That it was he, the doctor had no reason to doubt, as the relationship was also acknowledged by Mrs. Harcourt, who had recovered, in some measure, from the excitement into which she had been thrown by the unexpected meeting with her son, and now inquired anxiously after her daughter, and begged to be permitted to see her. 
               "Not at present, madam," replied the doctor. "You had better rest, and try to compose yourself. Sleep a few hours, if you can, and I think I may promise that you shall visit Miss Alice to-night." 
               "Alice is dead!" cried Mrs. Harcourt, misunderstanding the physician's promise that she would be permitted to see her child. 
               "Not so, madam," replied the physician. "On the contrary, she is better. Now, at least, there is ground for hope. She has recovered from her trance, and is sleeping calmly." 
               Mrs. Harcourt looked at her brother, as if still doubtful, and seeking corroboration of the doctor's words. The expression of his countenance satisfied her, and she consented to try and follow the physician's advice, Mr. Templeton promising to send her maid to watch over her. She embraced her son, and the gentlemen quitted the room together. 
               "Is it true, this that you say of Alice?" asked the young man of the doctor, as they walked toward Mr. Templeton's apartment. 
               "It is; there is hope, Mr. Harcourt; but be not too sanguine. A few hours will decide." 
               "Can I not see my sister? But for one moment?" pleaded the young man. 
               "No; her life and reason hang on a thread. Every thing depends upon her being kept quiet and free from excitement; but I promise you you shall see her to-morrow, perhaps to-night." 
                
               Henry was fain to be content, and to console himself with hoping for the best; and now, for the first time since he had entered the house, he bethought him of his friend Staynor. 
               Excusing himself from his uncle for a short time, he walked out into the garden, and Staynor, seeing him, emerged from the summer house. 
               "No excuses, Harry," he said, approaching and pressing his hand. "I have heard all. I did but wait to exchange a word with you. I will not enter the house, where my presence at such a time as this would be felt as an intrusion. I shall return to Troy, the city we passed on the road, and there await the result of your sister's illness. You will write to me?" 
               Harcourt nodded an affirmative; but could not trust himself to speak, and so the two friends and companions parted. This was Harcourt's first introduction of his friend to his uncle's house. 
               How wearily the hours passed away that long afternoon. How anxiously all waited for the awakening of the interesting patient; yet how all dreaded the moment, and feared the result. Alice had fallen back upon the arm of Clara, which had been outstretched to support her at the time, and Clara feared to withdraw it. With her arm still in this position, the young lady sat for hours until the blood ceased to flow in the limb, and her body became cramped in consequence of the awkwardness of her position, yet she made no attempt to extricate the arm, nor made the slightest movement, lest she should disturb the sleeper. It was three o'clock when Alice awakened out of her trance and raised herself in the bed. Four-five-six o'clock, and there were no new symptoms of wakefulness. Her brother and friends-even the doctor himself began to grow uneasy, and the latter requested Mrs. Jenkins to call him the moment the first sign of uneasiness or wakefulness was made by his patient. Henry was unable to endure the suspense and to sit quiet within the house. He went out and paced hurriedly to and fro in the garden in front of his sister's bedroom window. Seven-eight o'clock, and still Alice slept calmly. 
                
               The doctor said this was a good sign; but it was evident that his anxiety was upon the increase. At length, about nine o'clock, he was summoned by Mrs. Jenkins, who said that Alice had stirred two or three times, and seemed about to awake. The doctor followed the housekeeper into the room, while Mr. Templeton and Henry listened anxiously at the door. 
               Just as the doctor entered the bedroom the young lady opened her eyes; but closed them again without speaking, or, apparently recognizing any one present. Five minutes of the most intense anxiety followed, at the expiration of which Alice stretched her arms, yawned slightly, and again opening her eyes, lay quiet for a few moments, when, slightly turning her head, she saw and recognized Miss Withers. A faint smile passed over her face as she attempted to take the hand of her friend, but she was unequal, now, even to make this slight exertion; but the smile still lingered as she softly whispered, 
               "Clara, it is kind of you to be here. I have been ill a long time." 
               A sigh of relief from an intensity of anxiety that was almost unendurable was breathed by all present, and the doctor slipped noiselessly out of the room to assure the anxious listeners in the passage that his best hopes were realized. 
               "Where is my mother, and where are my uncle and Mrs. Jenkins, Clara?" whispered Alice. 
               "I am here, darling," said Mrs. Jenkins, replying for herself. "Your mama and your uncle will soon come to you; they will be so glad to learn that you are better. You will soon get well now, love. 
               "Yes, I shall get well now," replied Alice; "but I am very weak, Mrs. Jenkins. I dreamed I should get well when he came. He has come now. Have you seen him, Clara?" 
               "Who, dear?" said Miss Withers. 
               "Henry; my brother Henry." 
               The hopes of the two faithful nurses, so lately raised, were dashed to the ground. They glanced at each other, but dared make no reply. But the doctor had returned to the room while Alice was speaking, and he answered, 
               "Your brother will soon come and see you, with your mother and uncle. Do you think you are strong enough to bear the visit?" 
               "O, yes; let me see them as soon as possible. Why do they keep away from me?" returned the young lady. 
               The doctor again passed out of the room, leaving the two nurses with Alice. Both of them supposed that he was humoring the disordered fancy of the sufferer; for no intimation of the return of Henry Harcourt had been conveyed to them. In a few moments he looked in at the door, and beckoned Mrs. Jenkins out of the room. Then, for the first time, she heard the astounding intelligence of the return home of her favorite, Henry-so many months mourned as dead. 
               The old lady could scarcely restrain herself when Henry approached, and taking her hand, kissed her, and expressed his delight at meeting his old nurse again. Her delight would have been noisily demonstrated had it not been for the critical condition of Alice. For Alice's sake she controlled the extravagance of her delight, and in another minute the doctor and nurse re-entered the room, followed by Henry, leading his mother, and by Mr. Templeton. The meeting was a joyous one-all the more joyous for the gloom which had for a long time past filled the dwelling. Every heart beat high with hope, and Alice, considering her weakness, bore herself bravely. The doctor whispered to Mrs. Harcourt and her son that she would certainly recover. So happy were the mother and brother and uncle, that a long time elapsed before it was observed by any one of them that Mrs. Jenkins and Clara had left the room. Mr. Templeton was the first to notice their absence. 
               "Where has Clara gone?" he said. "Dear girl, to her assiduity and unwearied patience we owe much of our present happiness." 
               "Miss Withers quitted the room with Mrs. Jenkins just as we entered," said the doctor. "The young lady looked faint and weak, and no wonder: she has been supporting Miss Harcourt for hours, without changing the awkward position in which she sat, in the slightest degree, for fear of disturbing our interesting charge." 
               Henry started. "Clara! Miss Withers! uncle, did you say?" he inquired. 
               "Yes, nephew; do you know Clara?" A sudden flash of recollection crossed his mind. He looked at his sister, who returned his meaning glance, and both understood the cause of Henry's agitation. Mr. Templeton proceeded to state that Clara Withers had been a constant and unwearied attendant at his sister's bedside for many days. 
               "Clara Withers, dear Henry, whom you knew at Florence," whispered Alice. "My best and kindest friend, because she loves my brother." 
               The doctor now interposed, and insisted upon the gentlemen retiring, as it would not do to tax the strength of Alice too much, and at this moment Mrs. Jenkins re-entered the room, and said that Miss Withers felt greatly fatigued, and had gone home in the carriage. 
               The next day Alice was wonderfully improved. She was able to see her brother and to converse with him, and her uncle and mother, for more than an hour. The doctor said that he believed the singular illness she had experienced had effected a complete change in her constitution, and that it was probable she would henceforward enjoy excellent health; but the prostration of her system was so complete that it would be long before she recovered her strength entirely. 
               During the afternoon Henry rode over to the house of Mrs. Withers, and renewing his acquaintance with that lady and her older daughters, asked after Clara. He was informed that she was far from well-over-fatigue had prostrated her-and that at present she was unable to receive him. Leaving the house, the young man rode to Troy and paid his friend Staynor a visit, during which he informed him of the happy change from despair to hope which the last few hours had effected, and also of the presence in the vicinity of Clara Withers. 
               "I could not upbraid you yesterday," said Staynor, when he had listened to his friend's relation of the events of the last twenty-four hours, "because I saw that you were severely punished for your heedlessness. I am truly glad to learn that your sister will recover; but I must say now that you have not deserved this mercy. As to that angel, Clara Withers, if you don't marry her, you deserve to be whipped at the cart's tail, and then hanged." 
               "I don't know that she will have me," said Harcourt. 
               "Stuff and nonsense! Ask her plainly, and you will see. You tell me she was silly enough to go into mourning because she believed you were dead. Why should she refuse to marry you, now she knows you to be alive?" 
               "Perhaps, her mother-" 
               "Will object to her daughter's marrying several thousands a year! A very likely story. She would rather you would fix your fancy upon one of her older hopes, I dare say-and you ought to be compelled to marry one of them as an offset to the happiness which awaits you, if you choose to snatch it. You're not half good enough for Clara. That's a fact." 
               "Clara refused to see me to-day." 
               "Serve you right; and if you take that as a rebuff you deserve to lose her, and, 'fore George, I'll marry her myself; though I forget, I'm engaged to your sister Alice." 
               "Engaged to Alice!" 
               "Yes; I engaged myself, ever since the day we rode on the top of the stage from London to Southampton. I've been courting her mentally all the way across the Atlantic. I thought she'd recover, yesterday, even when I heard she was so ill, for I had resolved to marry her, and I seldom fail in any thing I undertake to do." 
               Harcourt laughed at his friend, and promised to take his advice, and after an hour's stay returned to Templeton Villa, insisting upon Staynor's visiting the villa on the following day. 
               Alice grew rapidly stronger, and, at the expiration of a fortnight, was enabled to sit up, and to ride out. Staynor, at Mr. Templeton's request, strongly backed by Henry, took up his abode at the villa, at the expiration of the fortnight, and promised to make it his home as long as he remained in America, which promised to be for an indefinite period, for he paid great attention to Alice, rode and walked out with her, and, it was evident, was rapidly ingratiating himself with her. From the first moment she saw him, she felt a strong partiality for the friend of her brother Henry. 
               On his part, Henry found little difficulty in effecting a reconciliation with Clara Withers, who was soon induced to credit his assertions that it was her mother's fault and not his which had led to their separation at Florence, and to his apparent coldness. What most effectually convinced her was a sight of the letters which she had written him, and which he had saved from the wreckers at Sartaroe, and preserved with the utmost care ever since. 
               At first, allusion was seldom made in the presence of Alice to her illness; but as she recovered strength she often alluded to the subject herself. During the whole period in which she lay in the trance, she said she had a perfect recollection of all that had passed. She could hear and understand what was said; but could not speak nor move, though she often strove to cry out. Once or twice she thought she had made her voice heard. Her greatest fear was lest she might be buried alive, and she had, more than once, listened with horror to Mrs. Jenkins, when she prayed that God would take her to himself rather than permit her to lie thus. She was not afraid to die; but she dreaded that her friends might think her dead while she was still living, and she wished to live to see her brother, who, she felt assured, was himself alive and would return home, and then she would be restored to health. After, as she supposed, Henry had entered tered the house, until she awoke feeble and indeed utterly prostrated, yet otherwise in good health, she fell into a state of unconsciousness, for she recollected nothing of the period during which Clara Withers sat by her side supporting her in her arms for hours; but that was the only period of utter forgetfulness she had known from the first hour of the seizure. 
               Six months passed away, and still Staynor remained a guest at Templeton Villa, and it was commonly reported that he had proposed to Alice Harcourt, and been accepted. Henry Harcourt's presence was required in England, for many reasons, in connection with the estate he had inherited, with all the particulars of which he had been fully informed by his uncle and late guardian. Still he postponed his departure and it was said that when he did sail for England, although Clara Withers would be no more, Mrs. Clara Harcourt would accompany him. 
               At the expiration of these six months a letter was received by Harcourt which caused him to pay a visit to New York. The subject of this letter, however, we will leave to be explained in the following chapter. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXXIII. 
               THE EMIGRANTS. 
               THE letter which led Harcourt and his friend Staynor to visit New York was from Rolf Frode, who had fulfilled his promise to return to America, at the expiration of six months, and bring his sister Hilda and her family, and Louise Von Welden with him. The young men hastened to meet and welcome Louise as the bride of Rolf Frode, or Rolf Swensen as he now styled himself. Rolf had returned to take up his permanent abode in America. He intended to purchase land in Wisconsin and there found a colony of his fellow-countrymen. His means to effect that object were ample, yet not superfluous. The title to the Christiania estate had lain so long dormant that when the Baron Von Welden reclaimed it, several persons made pretended claims to most of the better portions of the property, and although while the baron lived, no one ventured to present his claim, no sooner was he laid in his grave than these claimants sprang up on all hands. The absence of Rolf from Norway at the period of the baron's death, was taken advantage of by these pretended claimants who asserted that the grants had been presented to them by the crown, for services rendered during the troubles which occurred in Norway during the insurrection of 1815 and at the period of the annexation of that country to Sweden. When Rolf proceeded to take possession of the estate, in behalf of himself and his sister and her children, according to the will of the deceased baron, litigation was threatened, and several lawsuits were actually commenced. To oppose these, and to overthrow the claims of the instigators, it would have been necessary for Rolf to have remained in Norway for years, perhaps for his lifetime, and even had he done so success might have been doubtful. He had resolved upon settling in America, and therefore he resigned the major portion of the estate, unchallenged, to the several claimants, converted the small portion which remained to him into ready money, at a sacrifice, and left Christiania for Bergen, where, a few weeks after his arrival, he and Louise Von Welden were privately married by Pastor Bredell at the parish church of Tunes. So many legacies had been left by the baron, and so great a sacrifice had he made in disposing of his lands for cash that the actual amount of money which Rolf and Louise and Hilda found themselves in possession of was comparatively small to what many persons were led to suppose; still, as we have said, it was ample for their purpose. 
               Greatly to the delight of the young men when they arrived at New York, they found that a surprise awaited them. Hilda Welden no longer bore that name, she was now Hilda Petersen, and the happy wife of our old friend Hans, who had married Hilda on the same day on which Rolf and Louise were wedded. Some of Hans's friends rallied him on his marriage, it being well known that he had been a suitor for the hand of Louise Sigvald; but Hans good-humoredly said, that since he could not obtain Louise, he had done the next best thing in his power, in marrying the sister of her husband; and in reply to the banter he was exposed to in relation to the fact of Hilda's being a widow with a family, he replied that he was glad to have a family of children ready made to his hand. He had made up his mind to emigrate to the western States of America, where an abundance of children was no burden, but the greatest blessing, and he hoped to have twice as large a family before many years had passed over his head. 
               Harcourt found Louise once again the happy, artless, guileless girl whom he had met on the island of Sartaroe. She appeared to be most devotedly attached to her husband, and marriage had, as yet, stamped her brow with none of its cares and troubles. Staynor, who had never before seen her in a really happy mood, was enraptured with her beauty, and acknowledged that Harcourt's glowing descriptions of the island belle, expressed at Christiansund and during the journey thence to Bergen, were not to be wondered at. Harcourt was very anxious that the party should visit his sister at Templeton Villa; but they had secured their passage to the West, and could not remain sufficiently long in New York to enable them to accept the invitation. The young men inquired after their old friends, Herr Bredell and his wife and daughters, Christian and Margaret Jansen, and Carl, the light-house keeper at Sartaroe, whom they learned were quite well when Rolf and his party left Norway. Rolf had sought to persuade Christian and Margaret to accompany him and his family of friends, but the old couple were too infirm, and too aged, to wish to leave their native soil, beneath which, before many years passed away, they expected their bones to be laid beside the bones of their friends and kindred, so they gave the wanderers their blessing, and returned to end their days on the farm which had been bequeathed to them by the late Baron Von Welden. Carl Jansen, who was also invited to share the fortunes of the party, likewise refused. He held a good post for life, as keeper of the light-house, and besides was making money by means of his pilot-boat. He was too patriotic to quit his native land while he could remain, and do so well as he was doing. 
               Harcourt and Staynor remained in New York until their old friends departed for the Far West, and then returned to Templeton Villa. 
               Three months after this meeting and parting of old friends, a gay bridal party entered an Episcopal Church in the city of Albany. It consisted of two young men of handsome and fashionable exterior, and two young ladies, one fair and slender, yet blooming with health, the other also delicate, but stouter and taller, and possessed of all the ripe loveliness peculiar to an Italian beauty. Her portrait, or one which greatly resembled her, might have been seen in the Corsini gallery at Florence. These were the brides and bridegrooms, Alice and Clara, and Charles Staynor and Henry Harcourt. A stout elderly gentleman, and a somewhat antiquated yet still handsome lady, and a fine looking young man with bronzed features and manly expression of countenance, accompanied by a fair, blooming young matron, occupied a carriage by themselves. These were, Mr. Templeton and his sister, and Rolf Swensen and Louise, for Mr. Templeton, on hearing from his nephew that Louise was the daughter of the lady upon whom he had bestowed his love in vain, in his youthful days, had insisted upon her visiting him, and she and her husband had come from Wisconsin, where they had settled themselves happily, expressly to attend the wedding of their cousin Henry, for Louise's cousin, at any rate, Henry Harcourt was. The old gentleman was delighted with his niece, and promised to visit her and her husband during the summer. Other carriages followed, containing Mrs. Withers and her daughters, and the brides and bridesmaids, and the happy bridegrooms, and several invited guests; and half an hour after the party had alighted from the carriages and entered the church, they came forth from it, re-entered the carriages, and drove back to Templeton Villa, where dinner awaited them. In the afternoon the two bridegrooms, accompanied by their wives, and the bridesmaids of the latter, set out for New York, to embark thence for Europe, on their wedding tour. It was the intention of Harcourt to remain permanently in England, where his large property lay; but Staynor said he thought he should return and settle in the United States, where he could obtain a larger interest for his comparatively small capital. Hearty good-wishes followed the bridal party, and the remainder of the day was devoted to festivity at the villa; all the servants, and many of the tenantry of Mr. Templeton, partaking of his hospitality. 
                
               And now Templeton Villa was restored to something like the quietude of former days. Mr. Templeton and his sister and Mrs. Jenkins, with the servants-for Mrs. Jenkins was now considered almost as a companion by Mrs. Harcourt-were its sole occupants. The youth of the house had flown from it, and greatly did the old bachelor miss the sight of his niece's fair face, and the sound of her voice. The villa was now gloomy and lonesome; its light and life seemed to have departed from it. 
               Unable to reconcile himself to the absence of his nephew and niece, the old bachelor paid the promised visit to his newly-found niece, in Wisconsin, and remained with her and her husband until the return of Staynor and Alice, nine months after, leaving Mrs. Harcourt and Mrs. Jenkins the solitary occupants of Templeton Villa. 
               Henry Harcourt and Clara had taken up their abode at Harcourt Hall, --shire, England, and it had already been proposed to Henry to become a candidate for a seat in the next Parliament, as one of the county members, to which proposal he had consented. 
               Staynor and Alice took up their abode at Templeton Villa, at the old gentleman's special and pressing request, until they could find a residence in the vicinity of the villa which would suit them for an abode of their own, and when this invitation of the old bachelor's was accepted, he returned home from Wisconsin. 
               Actually the quiet, steady, solitary old bachelor, who had only a year or two before dreaded the arrival of his sister and niece, lest his privacy should be disturbed and his trim abode turned topsy-turvy, only came back from Wisconsin now because Alice Harcourt-a young favorite of his-and Charley Staynor, a gay, rattling young man, had consented to reside with him, and when he reached home, much amusement was afforded to his neighbors when it became known that he had brought with him from Wisconsin two of Hilda's children, both of whom he expressed his intention of retaining, as hostages, until his niece Louise should reclaim them by sending him a grand-niece and nephew whom he could adopt as his own children. 
               Here our tale might as well end, since we have disposed, by marriage or death, of the principal personages who have figured in the narrative, but we have yet a task to perform according to the usages of custom from time immemorial, to the performance of which task we shall devote a brief concluding chapter. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXXIV. 
               CONCLUSION. 
               DOCTOR JOHNSON headed the last chapter of his beautiful tale of "Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia"-"The conclusion in which nothing is concluded." It was a good idea of the great moralist's. Nothing ever is concluded in this world. No man ever lived who, upon his death-bed, could say that the object of his life had been attained. The end of every thing undertaken by mankind is, as is his life itself, a conclusion in which nothing is concluded! 
               It is always expected by the readers of, or the listeners to, a story, that the author or reciter shall, after having concluded the story, write or say a few last words, in which, in a general and summary manner, he shall state what occurred in after years to those characters, real or fictitious, in whom his readers or listeners have taken an interest: yet he seldom gives satisfaction to all in doing this, since it is as universally the case that something is left unsaid at the end of a story as that something is left behind at the commencement of a journey, or as that something is forgotten that ought to have been said when friends are parting. Still, in obedience to the rule, whether or not it be one better honored in the breach than in the observance, we will follow the example that has been set us by all writers since Mercury invented letters. 
               The colony founded by Rolf Swensen prospered fairly, suffering, of course, under the customary drawbacks common to all new settlements. Some thousands of Norwegians now occupy a portion of the soil of the present State, then, the Territory, of Wisconsin. And of these thousands, several hundreds emigrated grated by the advice of Rolf, being assisted by him with funds and other means, when such were wanting. In due time Louise presented Mr. Templeton with a grand-nephew and niece, although she did not consent to his adopting them, until she had provided herself with others to occupy their places in the family circle. The traveler in Wisconsin, for aught we know, may still meet with Rolf Swensen and Louise, for neither can be much past the meridian of life; and if they do, they will meet nowhere a fairer specimen of the Scandinavian farmer or fisherman than Rolf, nor a blither, more good-tempered, kind-hearted matron than Louise, though we can scarcely term her a Scandinavian, as she can, with the like propriety, claim England, France, Germany, or Norway as her native land, notwithstanding Norway was the land in which her childhood and youth were passed. 
               Mr. Templeton died about ten years after the period at which we bring our story to a conclusion, a hale old gentleman to the last, and exhibiting to the last, a remarkable fondness for the society of ladies, and of children, whose gambols he joined in, as much a child as any one of those whom he sought to amuse. His property at his death was left in equal shares to the children of Louise and Hilda, his nephew Henry Harcourt and his niece Alice being well provided for. Mrs. Harcourt returned to England, and resided at Harcourt Hall with her son and his wife until her death, which occurred but a few months previous to that of her brother. She was for years before her death a changed woman. Her trials during her residence in the United States, when she believed she was about to be rendered a childless widow, had softened the asperities of her temper. She lived the life of a Lady Bountiful to her son's tenantry, and died a pious and humble Christian, greatly lamented by all who knew her. 
               The elder daughters of Mrs. Withers never married; but continued to reside with their mother until her death. Their brother entered the army, and was killed by the Indians in Florida, and the three daughters, on the death of their mother, divided between them the property she left, and lived very respectable and worthy spinsters-for any thing we know they may be living still; but, if so, they must be long out of the matrimonial market. 
               Mrs. Jenkins survived her master, Mr. Templeton, only a few months. She was hale and strong to the last, but after Mr. Templeton's decease, her spirits became depressed, and she seemed to feel that her mission on earth had been accomplished. Every attention was paid to her during the last few months of her life by Staynor and Alice, with whom, after Mr. Templeton's death, she went to reside. 
               Henry Harcourt entered into the arena of politics, and was elected to the House of Commons. He kept his seat in the House for several successive Parliaments, voting always with the Whigs, and being always re-elected when a dissolution of Parliament took place. He was much liked by his colleagues, partly on account of the many good qualities he possessed, and partly because, as he increased in years, he showed a taste for the luxurious indulgences which are said to be hereditary in the family, although, to do him justice, it was rarely that he indulged to excess. He might, to the present day, have held his seat in Parliament, but for an unfortunate carousal, which put an end to his popularity, caused him to be rejected at the next election, and made him a baronet! He was required to give his casting vote for the Whig party, and brought, almost per force, to the House, and placed in his seat on the opposition benches. Triumph gleamed in the eyes of his party. The final vote was cast, when, to the horror of his friends, Mr. Harcourt, whose brain was slightly confused, voted with the Conservatives, and thus their entire work during the session was rendered useless. The government party were pleased to think it was a ruse of his own to forsake his party and come over to their side. He was privately thanked by the Prime Minister, and received from his sovereign the honor above mentioned. He retired to the country, and became a capital farmer and a hospitable country gentleman. He and his lady often visited their friends in the United States. 
               During one of these visits Staynor and Harcourt entered into a conversation, which led to various reminiscences of their more youthful days. The fidelity and truthfulness of women was the subject, and Harcourt, perhaps for the sake of supporting a theory which he had formerly affected to believe, spoke somewhat disparagingly of the sex. 
               "You know, Harry," said Staynor, "that your unprejudiced mind has been disabused of that morbid theory long ago. You are only arguing for arguments' sake. Clara Withers, your present wife, was at one time the scape-goat upon whom you hurled your anathemas. With what reason? She was true to your memory, when you had forgotten her. She is now your wife. Can man be blessed with a better wife than she has made you? I have married your sister Alice. Can you, or any man utter a word of disparagement in regard to her? And then, think of Louise Sigvald. Change of condition made no difference in her. Can more complete devotion, accompanied with more artlessness and modesty, be found in womankind than she has shown? How many men would have done as much for a woman laboring under false suspicions, and with the brand of disgrace stamped-though unjustly stamped-upon her brow as she did for Rolf? Confess, Harry, it is the silly pride, the false sentiment, the unmanly prejudices, the selfishness of our own sex, which leads us to condemn women-to disparage the sex to which our mothers belong. In ninety-nine out of a hundred cases, believe me, the fault originally lies with us, and not with them. If we men did our duty, few women would fail in the performance of theirs. Some of us look for perfection in women; there is no such thing as perfection on earth; but take them all in all, they are a thousand times better than we." And Harcourt listened, and confessed that his friend spoke the truth. 
                
               On these occasions Harcourt always visited Rolf and Louise in Wisconsin. Sir Henry Harcourt and Lady Clara Harcourt are still living in-shire, England. They have several children. Staynor and Alice, as we have said, resided almost constantly in America; after the death of Mr. Templeton, Staynor, who never could quite overcome his fondness for travel, visited the western States, and was so pleased with the appearance of the country that he made up his mind to speculate largely in land; and shortly afterward he removed to his new purchase, with his wife and four children. 
               Old Christian and Margaret Jansen died on their farm soon after Rolf and Louise left Norway, both within a week-bequeathing the farm to their nephew Carl. 
               We have omitted to mention that three or four years after Rolf had settled in Wisconsin, a wretched, emaciated individual made his appearance in the settlement, begrimed with dirt and worn to a skeleton with disease. He asked for Rolf Swensen, and was directed to his abode, but he sunk down exhausted before he reached the house. Assistance was sent to him by Louise, who saw him fall, and he was borne into the cottage by some farm servants. Every attention was paid to him, but he only rallied for a few moments, when, unable to speak above his breath, he made signs to Rolf, who stood over him, to place his ear to his lips. Rolf did as he was desired, and the unhappy man gasped forth the words, "Erik Lodbrok," and the next moment fell back and expired. It was he. Rolf brushed back the matted hair from the dead man's brow, and, changed as were the features by want, and dissipation, and disease, both Rolf and Louise recognized their once constant companion, Erik Lodbrok. 
               The Pastor of Tunes is, we believe, still living at Drontheim, in Norway, a very old man, greatly respected and occupying a high position in the established church of Norway. His wife died several years ago, but his daughters are both living and well married to men holding posts under the united governments of Sweden and Norway. 
                
               Away in the bleak, rough North Sea, upon a rocky island, eternally laved by the spray dashed from the surrounding ocean against its time and weather-worn cliffs, stands a beacon, to warn incautious mariners not to approach too near the dangerous coast; and still, morning and evening, a weather-beaten man, fast growing into years, may be seen trimming the lamps of the beacon, or peering with his spyglass into the horizon, as if trying to catch sight of any thing, no matter how trifling, which may engage his attention and vary the monotony of his solitary life. Yet the boatmen and fishermen of the island say that he is happy, and that he would not change the occupation in which he has grown old and gray, to be admiral of the Swedish and Norwegian fleets, and that he would not, for all the fine spectacles the theaters of Bergen or Christiania, or even Stockholm can afford, give up the daily enjoyment he derives from the free, unobstructed view of the ocean, to be seen from the gallery of the beacon tower. 
               That solitary old man-so weather-beaten, old, and gray-is Carl Jansen, keeper of the light-house on the island of Sartaroe.
