                     MOORE. (LALLA ROOKH.) 
                   
                
               HALL TO THE COUNTY OF BUCKS!-whose past history contains a glorious record of noble deeds, performed by sons of its soil in behalf of freedom and in defence of right; whose present position is among the foremost in science, in art, and all the belongings of modern enlightenment; and whose future of attainment rests with that position in keeping with Columbia's growing destiny. 
               All-hail to its people! who within but a comparatively short space of time have made the dense forest to bloom as a garden; while growing and abundant crops attest the skill, and numerous school houses on hill and in dale bear witness to the intelligence of those who now occupy the place of the ignorant Indian; who, through ignorance, suffered the whole of nature's intrinsic wealth to run to waste. 
               Where now the corn-tops wave in the Autumn air, and delicious fruits cover the ground in profusion, where stands you happy cottage home, and you white farm house, where blooms the clover, where the lowing kine are grazing, and where that pretty garden repays the zephyrs which visit it with loads of sweet perfumes, there once roamed none but the wild Indian, and there once existed nothing but one continue and unbroken desert of trees. Wild animals abounded, and from time immemorial this extensive continent was but as one vast hunting ground. 
               But at length came a change. Hither emigrated, now and then, little caravans of settlers from lands afar, to take up their abode in the wonderful now world of the West. Yet the peaceful occupations of civilization became necessarily blended for a while with the less useful pursuits of barbarous life; and the tilling of the ground was accompanied with the wild life of the chase, and occasional appeals to arms to protect the growing crops, the trophies of the hunt, and dear life. The aborigines of the soil were loath to give up their inheritance, and many a bitter conflict between them and the settlers resulted in bloodshed, fire and destruction. They laid in wait-they stole around at midnight, and it required the utmost of watchfulness, skill and courage to save one's self from being slaughtered by the way during the day, and one's family from being murdered, and home destroyed during the night. 
               To that part of Bucks county which is now know as the township of Plumstead, came in those days among others, a family consisting of a man, his wife, and two stalwart sons; brining with them all the necessary requirements for establishing a good home in a new country. They gathered around the first night's camp fire, not altogether unacquainted with the nature of the dangers to which they were exposed; and the sweet notes of a good old violin echoed for the first time from tree to tree in the solemn stillness of the summer's night; burdened with the tunes of another land and other days, and accompanied with the dear old songs of home-sweet home, far over the ocean of waters. 
               A few years passed, and the stalwart youths had become such a terror to the hostile Indians, that the settlement remained comparatively unmolested; for they constantly traversed the country immediately adjoining in every direction, and woe befell the prowling red-skin who chanced at night to fall into the hands of Joseph and Thomas Doan. But of the exploits of these two, it is not intended to say much at this time. The perils and dangers with which they were beset, the duels, midnight encounters, and battles fought with vastly superior numbers, the bloody scenes with which they were connected in defence of fireside and home, and the treacheries, innumerable accidents, and unfortunate circumstances which continually accompanied them, all these will furnish matter of itself sufficient for a separate history. The heroes of the present writing, although connected with them, are of later date, and their exploits of more immediate and greater interest. Nevertheless, we have something to say with regard to one of the two. Of Joseph and Thomas, the former was the elder. Of faultless symmetry as a man of powerful muscle, the great strength for which he was celebrated, was plainly indicated at first sight of his person. His countenance, naturally was one of extreme beauty, but the hardships and terrible scenes of his experience, had imparted to it a stern and somewhat savage appearance. Nevertheless he had good qualities of heart, and could be melted down to tenderest sympathies. This brave, strong man, like every other true man could sometimes shed tears. 
               Ay, it was a bitter time for him, when the flower his heart ceased to bloom for it more, and the delight of his wild life was laid low in the earth. He felt it severely, and the last sound of her voice-a shrill, piercing shriek-at times rang in his ears till the day of his death. The scene and the time was ever afterward pictured upon his memory. It happened in this manner.-It was in the heart of the forest, and the grey morning was just receiving the crimson tints of the rising sun. Joseph was returning quietly home, but his quick, eagle eye caught a glimpse of wily Indians stealing softly among the trees. He paused for a moment to watch for the character of their movements. Just as he had ascertained that they had with them two white female prisoners, a scream which was quickly stifled, echoed on the still morning air through the woody valley. The sound struck agony into his soul. It was the well-known voice of her he loved dearer than life. An involuntary expression of vengeance escaped him, which at once betrayed his presence, and as with a run and a bound he strove to reach them, the captive nearest him fell dead at his feet. In another second he had reached and clasped the other with his left arm, while with his right he felled three of the savages to the earth. The rest, recognizing their old and dreaded foe, and probably believing he was the leader of others who were in pursuit, immediately fled. Joseph had now time to attend to his charge whom he had rescued, and who had fainted from fatigue. But lo! he discovers that her he has saved is not his betrothed, but that the gory body over which he had just now stepped, was that of the one he worshipped and adored. Who can describe his feelings, or the pangs of soul which accompanied the realization of his disappointment.-A rippling stream trickled beside the body; and with its waters he first restored the living and then tearfully washed the dead. The strong man wept-wept, perhaps, because of his disappointment, but more probably from extreme depth of tender feeling. 
               The living sister, as she assisted in preparing the body for removal, cast her eyes gratefully towards her deliverer, as if to speak, but his apparent intense grief for bade her. 
               At length he himself spoke, as he bent over his dead loved-one- 
               "Life is no more to Joseph Doan," said he, "why might he not die and be buried with thee." 
               "Say not so," imploringly interposed the rescued girl," life must yet have many charms for one so noble, virtuous and brave. 
               "There is no one cares for me save them who gave me birth," replied the hero; "but why should I trouble them?-they say they need not my protection." 
               "Am I ungrateful?" 
               "If thou could'st but love me half as did thy sister, it would be something worth living for." 
               "I have a whole heart," replied she, "and if it is worth anything, it is thine, for thou art my deliverer." 
               "Perhaps I shall never love thee as I loved thy sister, but fair one, thou and I are from henceforth inseparable for ever." 
               The sound of footsteps was heard, and looking up, the pursuers of the Indians were seen coming towards the spot. In a few minutes the dead body of the stolen girl was being borne to her parents, and, on the morrow, she was buried by the side of other victims of Indian cruelty. 
               Some months have passed. A neat, new cottage is erected near the original log cabin, and two youthful and truthful hearts dwell within its walls, in the free and full reciprocation of mutual love. The sun never shone upon a happier pair. Joseph, the lover and the hero, and Ruth, the loved one and the grateful, could not possible bly have been better suited to each other. He loved her at first but for the sake of her sister, but now, for her own winning charms; she loved him at first but with the love of gratitude, but now, for those noble and generous qualities with which he had won and bound to himself, her heart. And their love was earnest-intense. Their peculiar circumstances naturally produced peculiar feelings, and also rendered common feelings of peculiar intensity. Of Joseph, no one can tell the anxiety with which he hurried homeward from the chase-no one can measure the depth of feeling which swelled his heart, as he bounded over rivulet, rock and bush, perchance, to catch the luckless savage that might have ventured near his dwelling, or to present himself safe and unharmed before his anxious wife. Of Ruth, who but those who best know the almost infinite love of woman's heart, can, in the faintest degree imagine the thoughts, the flutterings, the hopes, the fears that vibrated within her, like pendulum beats to the hours of his absence, till they were followed by keenest up-braidings, for doubting his skill and courage, on his safe return. 
               Both were elegant in person, both generous in disposition, both heroic in bearing and character. With their Indian enemies, retribution was, of necessity, invariably dealt for outrage; though the slightest signs of peaceful submission were encouraged by kindness, and strengthened into reality by substantial and prominent proofs of friendship. Indeed, some few had became firm friends; and would even endanger the safety of their whole tribe, rather than that any harm should come upon them, which they could possibly prevent. Joseph and Ruth were also of equal courage, though the latter, of course, was much inferior with respect to strength and skill.-Nevertheless, not a few of stout and nimble savages had been mastered by her during her girlhood, and right well did she merit the term applied to her by the tribe, and which had its equivalent in "The Brave White Squaw." 
               Of such parents were born the Doans of our history. 
             
             
               CHAPTER II. 
               An Adventure in a Storm. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "I have seen tempests when the howling winds 
                           Have rivid the knotty oaks-- 
                            
                           But never till to night, never till now 
                           Did I go through a tempest dropping fire:-- 
                        
                      
                     SHAKESPEARE. 
                   
                
               Many years have passed. Things have gone on prosperously but not without strife, and the happy evidences of civilization and intelligence are made conspicuously apparent, in the cottage gardens and fields which now decorate hillside and valley. 
               The stalwart young man, valiant and generous, whom we witnessed betrothed in the preceding chapter, has become the aged father, the blanching honrors of some three-score winters have settled upon his head, and the plough of time has made furrows across his broad and noble forehead. A family of stout young men sit around him, as during the long winter evenings he relates the adventures of his youth. Not that it was needful that they should listen to accounts of perilous situations and hair breadths escapes, to inspire them with the desire of becoming heroes of like circumstances. Far from it. Already had they acquired a love for a wild, roaming life, and weeks on weeks were spent by one or the other, or by two or more together, in roving through the woods in pursuit of game, or rambling among the rocks and over the mountains in search of adventures. Leading his kind of life from their earliest youth, they became hardy, strong and valorous, of noble form, and in every physical quality the close representatives of their worthy sire. 
               But the father as exhibited in the son, was most plainly visible in Moses Doan, the elder one of the family. He was indeed a paragon of human physical developement. Tall, but not slim, broad, but not corpulent, rough, but not ungainly, of powerful limb, yet of perfect symmetry; nature had stamped upon him from head to foot, the seal of perfect manhood. The exquisite softness of his eyes when undisturbed, only rendered their bright sparkling in laughter, more brilliant by the contrast, while their intense flashing in anger-was like lightning from the thunder-cloud of his frowning brow. Keen and piercing-no deceiver could long endure their scrutiny; nor Indian, nor white man could abide their gleaming when Moses Doan was once aroused. For strength and agility there was none could equal him, and in the gymnastic exercises and manly games which the young men of that time took delight in, he was ever the victor. In the various feats of running, jumping, climbing, wrestling, and so on, he invariably came off victorious over all competitors. As yet but a cow boy, in company with his brothers, it required such a man, possessing such qualities to protect the cattle from the marauding and cruel savages. Strictly speaking, his brothers only, were cow boys; while he, leaving the cattle in their charge, made excursions around, oftentimes meeting with the plunderers, and bringing home evidences of desperate encounters. His brothers, at times, followed his example, and occasionally even accompanied him, but he oftener preferred to go alone. 
               Thus they had roamed over hill and dale, mountain and glen, until every haunt of Indian, every rock, creek, road and ravine, for many miles around, were perfectly familiar to them. But this fondness for roaming and adventure soon began to affect home interests. The crops, the cattle, and everything were neglected. Old Joseph Doan was often left by himself to take care of things as best he could, while the cow boys were, perhaps, miles away engaged in the chase, or answering the war-whoop of some Indian chief with skillful, though fierce and undaunted bravery. 
               Weeks would pass, and at length they would return, perhaps one by one, perhaps, together. On one occasion two of them came home and found their father lying in a pool of blood, the house sacked and the plunder carried away.-There were also evidences of a desperate struggle. He had been wounded in such a manner, that it was impossible to stop the blood without aid, and were it not for their timely arrival, he would certainly have bled to death. Having dressed his wounds, and the old man having sufficiently recovered, he directed them to a certain spot in the woods where they found the three red-skin marauders lying dead beside their booty. 
               But Moses was still away. He returned, however, two or three days after the event, and the old man took occasion to advise him to set a better example to the boys and stay at home. An altercation ensued, in which Moses declared his determination to go, and come, and do as he pleased. He admitted that the others were not of age, and that they ought to stay at home; but claimed that himself was a man, and clear of his father's jurisdiction. 
               About a half an hour afterwards, Moses took his rifle and prepared for a night-excursion on foot. The old man saw that there was special business on hand and cared not to interfere. He knew it would be of no use at any rate, and therefore deemed it prudent to reserve what he had to say until his return. Presently, he heard him telling the boys to attend to things-soon after was heard his retreating footsteps, and in a few moments he was seen passing swiftly between the trees in the distance, in the direction of the Delaware river. 
               The clouds are piled one above the other in the west, and behind their round, pillowy edges is spread out one vast, dense curtain of deep and awful black. The air is still as death. Not a sound is heard, not even the buzzing of insects; all nature seems to be awaiting some awful calamity. Now a low murmur of thunder is heard; and the heavens become blacker; a louder peal, and yet a louder, accompanied with vivid flashes of lightning. 
               It is now dark; it is night. A human figure, rifle in hand, is crouching between the bushes and moving stealthily forward with eager, glistening eyes fixed upon some not very distant object, A stifled sound of thunder, immediately followed by a mighty rushing wind and gleamy lightning now breaks forth, and a large limb from a neighboring tree is precipitated with violent force upon the crouching figure.-Just then, a bright flash disclosed the head-plume of an Indian chief, as with a shriek, he sunk crushed to the earth. At this moment a second figure sprang forward from the spot indicated by the croucher's fixed and earnest gaze, and Moses Doan now stood over the gasping Indian. 
               "I will not harm thee," said Moses, as the Chief turned his eyes imploringly upward; "although thou would'st me were thy circumstance mine. But I cannot help thee-I must haste to save from a cruel death, one worthier of life than thou." 
               So saying, he took from him his rifle, and started off hastily to accomplish his night's work; having thus discovered that his enemies were about, and that therefore there was no time to be lost. Having proceeded a few rods, he turned aside to a clump of bushes where he deposited the rifle for safe keeping until his return. 
               The tempest now raged at its hight. Rain descended in torrents; the lightning seemed to dart downward to within a few yards of his feet; the winds howled among the trees, and blew, as if heaven and earth were coming together; the crash of falling timber apprised him every moment of impending danger; while terrific peals of thunder preceded by perfect blazes of intense brightness, rendered the night most hideous, appalling and awful. But he still pressed onward. 
               The storm, at length, became less severe, and presently the thunder, lightning, wind and rain had ceased, but it was still very dark. All nature ture was again hushed; a death-like silence reigned. 
               "White man go no farther," whispered a voice. 
               Moses turned and he could then see the dim outline of an Indian standing behind him. 
               "It is Shenoah!" exclaimed he, in a loudish whisper. 
               "Hish! there is danger here," replied Shenoah. "Follow me." 
               The Indian led the way to the distance of about five hundred yards when he suddenly stopped. He then directed his follower to proceed to the ninth tree in a direct line facing him, while he went down to the river, which was about thirty yards farther, to perform his part in the plot. Moses moved cautiously forward, and as he came near the tree designated, he observed something white, as it were leaning against it; which soon proved to be the object of his adventure. 
               The good Shenoah had, during the day, communicated to him the particulars of the capture of a white girl, on the preceding night; and the result was, that they mutually determined, if possible, under cover of darkness, to restore her to her home which was on the other side of the river. Hence the concerted action just now witnessed. 
               The girl was soon assured of the friendly intentions of the person whom she saw approaching her; and without much persuasion suffered herself to be quietly unbound and carried to the river side. Here Shenoah was patiently awaiting them with much danger to himself, having a boat in his charge, which, though of rude construction, was every way suited for the purpose intended. The river had swollen considerably by reason of the torrents of rain which had just fallen from the clouds. The waters now rushed madly on; and it was an utter impossibility to stem the current so as by that means to effect a crossing. But our two heroes thought not so much of the impetuous waters, as of the moving danger which they momently expected would appear on the shore. Both knew the river well, and the exact place where the natural course of the current would bear them clear to the other side. 
               Their little boat was cut from its mooring and noiselessly, gallantly and swiftly it glided down the furiously rushing stream. But just as they were about to strike out toward the centre of the river with the bend of the current, and where a small creek was pouring in its augmented contribution thereto, indications of a fire were discovered at a little distance on the shore; and as the dexterous Shenoah secured the boat at the earnest request of Moses, who wanted to land, a lurid blaze shot up from the spot, proving undoubtedly that their conjectures were correct. By the light of the flame another object also presented itself. It was nothing more nor less than an approaching Indian, whose turn had come to be on the watch, and who had just left the camp-fire. 
               Moses knew that the noise of stopping and mooring the boat must have already attracted his attention, and that there remained but little time before his suspicious would be sufficiently aroused to prompt him to give the alarm. With one bound from the boat, he reached the shore; and within a few moments a crackling of brush-wood and rustling of dry leaves were heard, as of persons wrestling, and then a sudden plunge and all was still. A dark object was perceptible on the surface of the water which came rushing from the mouth of the creek into the Delaware, and as it was carried swiftly by, the quick eye of Shenoah recognised it as the proof of the triumph of Moses. Soon after, the latter returned to the boat resolving to pry a little farther into matters on his return; as the safety of the girl was of far greater importance to him than the mere gratifying of his curiosity. 
               Once more the little boat was given to the current, and shot almost like an arrow obliquely across the river. But now came the difficulty. Great skill and dexterity were required to prevent their being carried farther than the point at which it was intended to land. The Indian boatman knew no difficulty, and was amply prepared for any emergency. One short moment only was allowed them in which to obtain the mastery over the strong and struggling waters-another, and the boat may be still gliding far down the stream. But the moment is now gone, the purpose is accomplished, and in a few moments more the trio are safely landed on the Jersey shore. Shenoah had previously prepared a hiding place for the boat, and having hid it therein, they set out at once for the girl's home. Morning was approaching when they reached the house, and the noble Indian after receiving the heartfelt thanks of the household, took his leave and departed. 
               Moses, however, was prevailed upon to stay, He needed not much persuasion. The plaintive tones of the sweet voice he had heard in the dark woods, still hung upon his ears. He had been longing to see the lips that spoke such music, and the morning light soon unfolded to him the rare beauty of the rescued maiden.-Though pale and debilitate from the effects of her adventures, she was still beautiful. However, by the aid of restoratives which had been administered during the day, towards evening her wonted healthy appearance returned. The eyes of the here never before looked upon such loveliness. Little Cupid took immediate and full possession of his heart, and at nightfall Moses left the house, to return home with a heaving heart, throbbing with love for the girl he was about to leave behind him. 
               The Delaware had gone down considerably during the day, and in certain places it was quite possible to ford across it. The love stricken youth was not so deeply struck as to forget the dangers he would be likely to encounter on his way home. Having re-crossed the river a short distance above the point at which it was crossed the night preceding, he again discovered indications of a camp-fire in about the same place as before. Quickly but cautiously he stole among the trees, till he came within a short distance of the fire. Here it was necessary almost to hold one's breath, so quick were the watchful savages to detect the least sound of approach. Cautiously, and yet more cautiously he crept, till he came within full view of the camp. He looked, and as he looked his teeth ground upon each other, his eyes flashed fire, and his right hand involuntarily flew to the trigger of his gun, at the sight which there met his gaze. The brave, the noble, Shenoah was a prisoner, and a council was apparently being held to decide on what should be done to him. His arms were pinioned behind him, and some of the savage tribe were standing and mocking him. Strong and agile as Moses was, and as he knew himself to be, the number of them was greater than he dare cope with. But still he lingered and watched in the hope that some chance might favor his purpose. He was in a position from whence he might pepper them pretty seventy, but that would only result in his discovery and, perhaps, make matters worse for his friend. Presently they all rose up from council, and it seemed to Moses, that their actions indicated preparations for Shenoah's execution. He could look on no more. He turned away vowing vengence on every Indian that should ever cross his path. 
               As soon as he was safely out of hearing, he made rapid progress through the forest toward his home. He had walked for about an hour and nothing of any importance had occurred to attract his attention. His mind had been deeply absorbed in thinking of the lovely girl over the water; but now the fate of the brave Shenoah occupied his thoughts. Suddenly he was aroused to look around him, by a rustling sound some distance behind, as of a person swiftly passing. He paused. 
               "Is it some frightened animal? Is it an enemy? Is it Shenoah?" 
               These questions flew instantly through his mind. The object passed to his right, and soon, again, all was silent. 
               "Too fond-too foolish a hope," mused Moses, as he resumed walking; "Shenoah has gone down among the dead an hour ago. 'Tis some curse of an Indian enemy though, and if he's utter my tracks, and alone, it won't be very good for him if he finds me; and if he knows Moses Doan, he must be a blockhead not to know that much too." 
               Some time elapsed, during which Moses walked on in silence. He now struck into a cow-path and could see to a considerable distance before him. Casually raising his eyes, he was surprised, to discover, to all appearances a man walking directly in front of him. At every turn of the path he saw him, but for a moment, and then lost sight of him again. This was kept up for about the space of a mile. Soon, however, he began to gain upon the unknown, and by walking noiselessly, as he only knew how, in a few minutes came near enough to recognize his form, as in every particular answering to that of his late faithful Indian companion. 
               "Brave Shenoah," exclaimed Moses, rather loudly; what? Safe? Brave fellow!" 
               At the first sound of his voice, the man motioned to run, but paused suddenly, and throwing up his arms and otherwise gesticulating as if pleased, turned towards Moses, laughing, and extending his hand. It was Shenoah. 
               "Me captured-me escape, said the Indian, with a look of pleasure; but suddenly frowning he continued, "but me go where no man find me. Indians call you: Tahantsee-me like no white man but Tahantsee. One treacherous white man, he hear me say 'go no farther;' he have companion, he no attack you and me; he go coward-tell Indians-they lie in wait for me-many Indians-capture me by the riverside-hold council-me must die awful death-don't known how. They untie my hands-some little noise near by make surprise-some say 'It is Tahantsee.' They leave five men with me, and the rest go towards the river to catch Tuhantsee hantsee. Me then fight five men-three Indians kill-two white men run away. I run too-and now me go where Tahantsee never see me more-me like Tahantsee-me no like other white men-bad men-Indians not like their fathers-bad Indians-no just, no true-me go to setting sun and me find no better, me lie down to rest-me sleep-me no more wake to walk the earth." 
               "Is Shenoah a squaw, that he has become thus afraid of his enemies?" asked Moses, with a pretended sneer. 
               "Shenoah no afraid. Great numbers come for me-they take me captive, me no would die a captive." 
               "That's noble!" exclaimed Moses. "Come with me, Shenoah, and be thou my companion." 
               "Ha, that is good! very good! Me trust Tahantsee. But me no trust any one else. White man betray me, betray you too; then come great number-both die captives-Oh no-not good." 
               "Well," replied Moses, "if thou wilt go, good luck to thee. Presently I will show thee something; and as thou hast nothing wherewith to protect thee, I will find for thee a handsome rifle, and considering who owned it, there's not much risk in saying a good one too." 
               He then led the way to a spot a little distance farther, where still were found some remains of of the body of the Chief, from whose death-shot providence had so signally saved him two nights before. After relating the circumstance to the astonished listener, he took him to the place were he had hidden the gun, and having found it, presented it to him; after which the two heroes bade each other adieu, and parted for ever. 
             
             
               CHAPTER III. 
               The Outcast. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "Yes I am of that outcast few 
                           To Iran and to vengeance true." 
                        
                      
                     THE FIRE WORSHIPPERS. 
                   
                
               Old Joseph Doan was sitting in the door way of his cottage, when he saw Moses returning He had inwardly resolved either to make him stay at home, or to drive him from the house. There was a great deal of work to be done, but everything remained neglected; and the old man was left to grieve at the sad condition of things. The example set by Moses, had taken effect upon the rest of the boys, and their deeply rooted love for wild life, though, to all appearances, checked, at least, for a while, only grew the stronger, for growing, as it were, underground; and took deeper and deeper root every day. Yet the old man was but reaping what he had sown, and was receiving exactly as he had rendered. The same bitter experience he now felt with regard to Moses, his own parents had felt with regard to him; for it was not until his energies became impaired and his strength reduced, that he relinquished the same kind of life. Indeed, Moses, being his eldest son, was brought up and trained to it, and it was too much to expect that he could now be made to desist. He had himself kindled the fire, and now, if his old age tells him he has done wrong, he must abide he scorching; for he cannot put it out. 
               As Moses approached the house, the old man went in and sat down on a beach near the hearth, with his face between his hands. He remained in this position until his son entered; who, while taking him by the shoulder with one hand gently raised his head with the other, and inquired- 
               "What ails thee, father?" 
               "Thou knowest well what ails me, Moses," replied the troubled patriarch; "but thou carest not. Thou seest that I am old and feeble, and thou art my son, why then, wilt thou not be my son?" 
               "Wherein am I not?" 
               "Canst thou ask? If thou dost leave me here alone because I am thy father, then let me tell thee thy sonship is of little profit to me. We are many-this house is too small for us; ten years ago I solicited thee in the manner of a father, that thou would'st as a son assist me in building to it, and hast thou not done it like a son. These ten years, I have gathered crops for thee, like a father, and thou hast eat of them like a son, and shared the profits. These ten years I have besought thee like a good father, for thine own interest to stay at home, and thou hast been continually wandering away like a dutiful son. These ten years my heart has been tender and open expressly to receive the slightest imprint of thy filial affection, but instead, it has only been made to feel the more acutely for its tenderness, and the more largely for its openness, the stabs and thrusts- 
               "I'll hear no more!" 
               "Is it not so?" 
               "Thou dost wrong me." 
               "Wherein? Is it in telling thee the truth? Have I not ever been kind to thee-been a father to thee? Hast thou been a son to me? Whither thou goest I know not; but this I know, thou art not often where thy father is who needs thy help." 
                
               "What help?" 
               "See thou yon woodland, bring that under the plow; and go thou to yon hillock, and see thy aged father's strength and substance wasting away in the ungathered crops." 
               "Where are my brothers? talk to them-they are yet within thy jurisdiction; I am not. I deserve not thy upbraidings; thou hast bothered me much with them of late, but I'll hear no more. Farewell; I leave thee forever." 
               "Be it so." 
               "And it shall be so;" said Moses, with great emphasis, as he strode out into the yard. 
               The old man followed him as far as the door, with tears in his eyes; and would have endeavored to effect a compromise, were it not that a thought crossed his mind, that with Moses out of the way, he could the more readily institute reform in the rest of his family, and then, he perhaps, would some time again return. 
               Moses began immediately to prepare for his departure. He cleaned his rifle, attended to his horse, replenished his ammunition receptacles, and was busily employed in such like necessary occupations until after sunset. About sunset his brothers came home, who as they came near the house were much exercised as to what was up. They gathered round him, expecting to learn the nature of his proceedings, from the account of his last adventure, which he would always relate on every return. 
               "I can't talk now, boys; I'm going to leave," said Moses. 
               "Not going to leave for good and all?" enquired one of them. 
               "Yes for good and all; just as soon as I can clap a saddle on that pet of a horse of mine," replied he. 
               "Why what's up?" asked another. 
               "I and the old man are two;" said Moses; "d'ye understand that?" 
               "Where are you going, Mose," enquired a third. 
               "That question is unanswerable," he replied; and Moses placed the saddle on the back of his steed, and without waiting to give them farther satisfaction, started off down the lane, and was out upon the highway in a twinkling. 
               The last rays of the sun were all drawn in to the yet gilded west, marking the close of another day in the autumn of 1770; and the silence and calm of the still evening hour, was well calculated to entice the mind to reflection. 
               "I am now an outcast," he soliloquized, as he rode along. "Shenoah was right; Men are all enemies to each other, and henceforth, I will be an enemy to all. I hate all mankind. Must I give up my pursuits-my life, to toil out my days like an ox. No. To live with Nature; to wander by her streams, to climb her mountains, to explore her rocks and caverns, to find out her wonders, be this my occupation. I love her hills and shady dells, and to chase the bounding deer by the twilight of morning. I love the songs of birds, the murmuring of rills, the rustling of the leaves as the wind sweeps through the forests, and all the varied music of Nature's orchestra And because I love these, I am driven, an outcast, from my home; like Cain for his fratricide. An outcast! But I will have a revenge. Revenge!" he pronounced again with emphasis. Continued he, "Ah! now I have bethought me," there is yet one grateful heart that has not cast me off-my tender, gentle Mary. She told me she loved the adventures of that dreadful night; and, it may be, she loves my wild roving disposition. To her home-to her home I will now hie me, if it be but for one more of those affectionate glances, or but for one more of those love-laden smiles. Yes, gentle Mary; I will be with thee once again, and if it be but to part again, no human shall ever cross my path with impunity." 
               Night had now let fall her pall of darkness over the earth, and all nature seemed to mourn the departed day. Bright stars spangled the sky, and the round, full moon was just rising to impart her borrowed light to the darkened world. 
               "This is a beautiful night," said Moses, contemplating the scene around him and the sky above him, after the lapse of about ten minutes in silence; "methinks I can read in it a useful lesson. When a gloomy night comes around me in my affairs, I may sometimes see stars of hope if I look up; and, it may be, a moon will arise meanwhile with a foretaste and earnest of that success and bliss, with which the sunny day of my life shall be lit up to perfection. Mary is my star of hope now, but I have other lesser ones in view-my firmament is bright with them; some are points to be won, and some are deeds to be done-cheer up Moses Doan, the sun will shine yet." 
               So saying, he urged his steed and in a few moments reached the Delaware. Here the wavelets gamboled with the bright moon-rays, and the sheen of the moonlight was spread out upon the deep water like a sheet of silver. The noble animal he rode, struck out into the stream, and the noise of the splashing resounded through the stillness that had prevailed, while the dark appearance of the horse and rider in contrast with the bright water through which they were passing, rendered them a conspicuous mark for the skillful archers of the woods. 
               When about half-way between the shore and what is now known as Armitage's Island, Moses was suddenly saluted by the whizzing of an arrow which passed him, and then another, and still another. The horse, as if understanding the nature of his master's danger, redoubled his exertions and quickly gained the shore of the islet. But then all was still again. 
               For the triple purpose of resting his faithful brute-companion, to feast his eyes and mind on the scene around him, and to watch for his enemies, Doan concluded to stay a little while there, and look about him. The constant gurgling of the waters during the quiet of night was what he delighted to hear, and as they parted before the extreme southern point of the island, his heart joyed in the music they created, which was kept time to, by the dancing waves, whose every particular tiny atom of foam represented a fairy queen covered with bright jewels. To eastward was seen the rugged summit of Goat Hill, while to the westward might be dimly seen also the broad, round top of Bowman's Mountain. There rose the rocks of the Narrows, which the moon had rendered visible by the plain contrast of light and shadow; and yonder are the sandy lawns of New Jersey, stretching as far as his sight can reach. Now he casts a long and somewhat painful look towards the home of his childhood, and as the scenes of his boyhood with the comfortable cottage home and a mother in it, flitted through his memory, the tears stole into his eyes, and he looked away to remember his manhood by directing his attention to the spot from whence he expected danger. 
               There the waters flowed in silence along the green shore, and nought was to be heard from thence, save the occasional whispers of the night-breezes among the tree-tops, and the constant chirping of insects upon the bushes. At length he turned to his horse, and was about to spring into his saddle when he fancied he heard a footstep on the island, and near him. He held his breath, and leaned with one hand on his rifle and the other upon the saddle, but heard nothing. After about the space of two minutes, he felt sure he heard whispering and then another footstep. It was no vagary of imagination; it was real and he determined to ascertain from whence the sounds proceeded. Carefully scanning the immediate neighborhood around, he tied his horse, fully convinced by previous experience that if any one appeared in that quarter during his explorations, he would receive due notice of the fact. 
               The little isle on which he was standing, though covered with wood, might, on ordinary occasions and during daylight, be pretty well searched in a very short space of time; but the voice and tread he had heard, had so convinced him of the presence of some one, that he verily believed his life depended on the closest scrutiny. By the time he had reached the opposite end of the island, a short, acute whinney from his horse made him instantly turn about, and rushing to the side of his dutiful watcher with all possible speed, arrived just in time to hear a splashing near the shore on the Pennsylvania side; and presently saw two Indians emerge from the water and effect a safe arrival on the green bank. Moses Doan's first impulse was to fire upon them, but reflecting that they did him no harm and perhaps intended none, he still held his rifle while he watched their movements. The arrows which whizzed by him a while ago, he reasoned, could not have come from them; for he had been watching in that direction all the time since he came from thence, and was certain that no one had passed from that side to the island. They must have come from the other side; and conjecturing that they were probably pursued, he wisely concluded to leave the dangers of their capture to their pursuers. He saw them move quickly a short distance up the shore and then suddenly disappear among the trees. Moses now thought it was high time to continue his night's ride, and mounting his horse soon safely gained the Jersey shore. 
               It was now growing late; the moon was high up in the sky, and as he looked upward, the stars seemed to smile down upon him with rays of encouragement. 
               "There was an idea in my mind," said he to himself, "which, though I am sure it must be of very recent experience, is now out of my memory as to what it was-but yon blue sky with those small gems that seem to smile so beneficently, has a similitude somewhere which I have lately seen, but which I cannot place. Where in all this wide, wide world-?-Ah! now I have it-'t is in my Mary's eyes. The same brightness surrounded by the same azure, and darting forth the same benevolent rays. In truth I almost believe in heaven; and that the stars are the bright eyes of angels-kind, loving, watchful angels; ay, Mary! I would thou wert one of them, instead of a human to waste thy loveliness in this cursed world. But I must be moving." 
               As he said this he gave his horse the rein, and gallopped on in the direction of the house that held the idol of his heart, who was perhaps, sweetly slumbering, and dreaming of some fanciful scene in the far off future, when she would be the wife of some such gallant and noble hero, as was Moses Doan. Fainter and fainter grew the sound of his horse's hoofs as he went, and listeners were not wanting to mark the gradations. The escape of Shenoah was not yet forgotten by those who had marked him as a victim instead of the beauteous white girl whose escape he had aided; nor was the part which Moses acted in that affair yet put out of their remembrance; and hence they were skulking about him wherever he went, in the hope sometime to effect his capture by the aid of numbers, to be suddenly brought upon him by some cunningly devised means. 
               When the distant sounds had completely died away, two white men issued from the woods into the road. 
               "He's a noble looking fellow, Sam;" said one; 'I wouldn't like much to run foul of him alone." 
               "Nor I," answered Sam, "he's plagued strong and quick; I have seen him throw a half-a-dozen men one after the other, every one equal or over his own weight, and all done just as easy as saying so." 
               "I'll be hanged if I like this Indian business-they may catch him themselves. He'd make a deuced good leader wouldn't he?" 
               "Capital!-but how are you going to get him?" 
               "Ah, that's a question. He and that plagued redskin, Shenoah, are mighty brave, stout and knowing fellows, and they are not going to be caught either one way or the other; and to save myself from falling into their hands, I'm bound to leave the cussed Indians to-night." 
               "I'm agreed," said Sam, and instantly they turned and struck off in another direction. 
             
             
               CHAPTER IV. 
               A Conflict. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "Woe to the half dead wretch who meets 
                           The glaring of those large blue eyes." 
                        
                      
                     PARADISE AND THE PERI. 
                   
                
               Moses Doan arrived at the residence of his Mary a short time before midnight. Dismounting at the gate, he secured his horse and proceeded up the flower-bordered pathway. The moon was still shining brightly, and as he approached the door, he saw the shadow of something tall, pass swiftly around the northern corner of the house. At that time the slightest circumstance occurring at night, was sufficient to warrant suspicion of the presence of maraud-ring and incendiary savages. Moses had often been made acquainted with this fact in his own home, and in the present instance needed no second circumstance to persuade him of the importance of keeping his eyes about him. He was always prepared for danger, and possessed great presence of mind at all times and under all circumstances. Quick as thought he was at the corner, and from thence stole softly round into the yard. Then crouching down, as he had been wont to do in the woods, behind a pile of brush-wood that was close by, he looked and listened attentively; if perchance the slightest sound or motion might reveal to him the whereabouts and objects of the intruder. For full ten minutes he remained crouching, listening and watching. Not a sound could he hear but the gentle flapping of the little leaves of the vine which climbed the side of the house, as the soft breezes blew among them, and nothing could he see as yet, which he would suppose unusual, or indicative of evil intent. But he was sure he had seen the shadow of a man, and he was too familiar with the cunning of Indians to give up watching. 
               Presently there was a slight move a little distance off, and the eagle-eye of Moses was not slow to detect it. His heart came up into his throat, as it were, but it was not with fear, it was but the mere excitement caused by the circumstance of the moment. All was again still. The trusty rifle was examined, and the bright knife was drawn from its leathern sheath. His hand trembled not, as he drew his finger along the keen edge of the latter, and the ruddy hue of health still glowed upon the cheek which palemess never knew, as he gave his attention to the priming of the former; and with a firm and steady look, he directed his attention to the spot where crouched the intruder. 
               Moses never thought to sacrifice life wantonly or without cause, and although he might at that instant have shot the living object dead, he preferred to wait until he should have witnessed something to justify the act. He now clearly saw that what he had been watching was nothing else than an Indian, hid behind a similar pile of brush-wood, to that which he had himself self chosen wherewith to hide himself from view. Visions of what he had often seen now passed through his memory-lurid flames ascending heavenward, as if to invoke Heaven's vengeance for the sacrifice of infants and children who were perishing in their midst; the awful scenes of bloodshed and murder, which had been often pointed out to him, as the deeds of plundering savages; his father's glowing account of the bravery of the few first pioneers in his section and soul-harrowing descriptions of the dreadful scenes of his earlier days-visions of all these passed through the mind of Moses, almost inciting him to rush upon the prowling redskin, and at once pierce him to the heart. But he forbore. 
               Whatever suspicion the Indian might have just before entertained, as concerning his being watched, it was certain from his actions now, that at present he entertained none. He boldly rose to his feet, and commenced working at the pile of brushwood before him, pulling out little twigs and stooping with them, as though care fully arranging them for some special purpose. It was not long before Moses heard the ominous click of the old fashioned flint and steel mode of obtaining fire, and presently a small blaze was making a crackling among the aforementioned twigs, till a larger one shot up and lighted the yard around. Quick as lightning he bounded to the spot; his body coming in powerful contact with that of the Indian, violently throwing him to the distance of several feet.-It was but the work of a moment to stamp out the fire; and the infuriated savage, just as he had done so, had turned upon him, and was in the act of hurling a tomahawk, with all his force to cleave his head in twain. Moses heard the whizzing of the death-missioned instrument, and by a quick dexterous movement avoided the blow. His still more infuriated, but cowardly enemy, seeing that he had aimed to no effect, immediately turned and fled. Doan in his frenzied rage when he sprung at the midnight incendiary, had forgotten his rifle. He must either pursue or lose the fugitive. Foaming with anger he rushed after him, with the fury and speed of a destroying angel. Over the lawn, the one for life and the other for vengeance, they sped like devils. Both were well-matched for speed. Not a loss or a gain could be perceived in the distance between them, up hill or through vale, for nearly a mile. 
               The Indian was of lithesome limb, yet of powerful frame, and nimble as a deer. He was not unacquainted with his pursuer, nor had he any doubt that he was followed by one, of all white men, the most dreaded by him and his red companions. Moses too knew the victim he was striving for; he had seen him the night before in the council of death, over his faithful Indian friend, and the remembrance of Shenoah, urged him on in the pursuit with still greater fury.-He had met him before when nought but his fleetness of foot had saved him from just punishment at his hands, for his many cruel deeds.-But now his cup of crime was full to the brim, and when Moses Doan once resolved on retribution, it had to come. 
               The race still continued to be equally contested, and were it not for the peculiar circumstances attending it, no doubt, both would have enjoyed it finely. At length Moses began to perceive that the wily Indian was endeavoring to draw him into danger, as, from the course he took, it appeared he was making for some particular spot, where his brethren were congregated. Both now made renewed and gigantic efforts; the pursued, however, apparently tiring from over exertion, but the pursuer, as though gifted with fresh vigor, gaining rapidly; and coming within but a few yards of his heels. 
               At this point the race became exciting and desperate in the extreme. A short distance before them was a little brook, running in a deep ravine which was covered on both banks by briars and thorny bushes so thickly growing that to pass through them was an utter impossibility. Here the flying savage thought to make his escape successfully, by attempting a leap so prodigious and hazardous, that with all the proofs he had witnessed of Doan's wonderful agility and daring, he evidently did not think him capable of. This leap was to be his own utmost, and being the Indian most celebrated for such feats among his brethren, he had but little fear that his pursuer would follow him farther. But he was greatly mistaken, as the event soon proved. 
               With a yell the savage came to the brink and in an instant was upon the other side; but he had not entirely cleared the ravine. His foot became entangled in the briars, and before he could extricate himself, Moses confronted him, having alighted two or three feet beyond him, 
               According to a tradition still afloat in that part of New Jersey, which is now called King-wood, the space of the leap was measured on the very next morning, from the verge of the ravine, whence he sprang, to the deep marks of his shoes on the other side and found to be full twenty-one feet!! The place was marked by stakes driven into the ground, and was for many years afterwards shown to visitors, and the distance pointed out, as the panther leap of Moses Doan! 
               There was a sort of paleness came over the Indian's countenance, as with astonishment his eyes gleamed defiance at his adversary. He had been overcome and defeated with regard to escape, and now his determined position, and defiant manner, indicated his readiness to try his chance in fight. Quicker than thought his long knife was drawn, and drawing back, he prepared himself to make a deadly plunge. 
               Moses was with him. His knife was also instantaneously drawn, and its keen edge was ready to do its death-work. His large, blue, keen eye scanned his antagonist through and through, as though he was intent upon calculating the exact amount of strength and skill he was capable of. Narrowly he watched every slight expression of his eyes, for not a breath of fear, or of any emotion could possibly affect the Indian's soul, in the slightest degree, but Doan could defect it faithfully chronicled there. 
               In point of physical perfection, there was scarcely a particle of difference between the two. Both were well formed men of nature-robust and powerful. In point of courage the savage was vastly the inferior. He would rather run, unless he was either sure of victory, or absolutely compelled to fight. Moses on the other hand would resent a wrong, no matter how formidable his antagonist. 
               But now the Indian's energies are fully aroused, and what he lacks in courage he makes up in rage. Never before had his swiftness of foot and agility failed to serve his purpose, and for the first time in his life he found himself compelled to stand up and face a foe, at least his equal. The latter was enraged almost to madness too, and the many immediate circumstances which made him so, might be added the remembrance of innocent children and their defenceless mothers, murdered and scalped by his ruthless hands. 
               On then to the contest they rushed. The benevolent star-rays seemed now to assume the character of pity, over the mortal strife begun, and the moonbeams flashed brightly upon their glittering knives. They met, and the clang of their weapons resounded through the still air, and echoed on the deep, dead silence of midnight, from wood to hill. But the clash of battle was of short duration. With the ferocity of a tiger the Indian sprang with his knife uplifted, and as though actuated by the fury often thousand demons, his eyes gleamed frightfully, as with mighty force, the sharp weapon descended like lightning toward Doan's heart. Moses suddenly dropped on one knee, and the terrific blow aimed at the immediate dwelling place of his life and soul, merely took effect in his hat. Quicker than the tenth part of a moment flies, was the upward dart of the croucher's knife, a sound as of the crashing of bones was heard, a glistening weapon went whirling through the air, and the Indian's knife-arm dropped useless to his side. The blow had taken him immediately upon the elbow, effectually releasing his hold upon the knife, and sending it to the distance of several yards. 
               "I have thee now, thou scoundrel of an old red skin;" said Moses, grasping him tightly; "Surrender, or by Heaven! I'll murder thee." 
               "Never!'" gasped he. "Me have friends come presently," and he endeavored to give the war-whoop, but Moses immediately gagged him. 
               "Well, I reckon they won't hear much from thee now, old copperhead; thee must content thyself, either to hang or roast, or both." 
               This idea made the savage shrug his shoulders, and make a desperate effort to release himself. In the course of the struggle Doan's foot caught in some straggling briars with which the ground was covered, and both fell locked in each other's death-like grasp. Hope once more revieved the partly tamed fury of the Indian, and as they struggled and rolled, Moses perceived that his adversary had an object in view, in his desperate endeavors to force him near the creek. The savage straining every nerve and muscle, had succeeded in reaching the brink of the ravine; and but one more effective effort was wanting, to roll with his antagonist down into the water below; his last fond hope of victory, consisting in the possibility of being enabled, when once there, to keep him under until he drowned. Already were they both bleeding profusely, from scratches received from the bed of thorns and briars over which they had struggled, and the steep descent now before them, offered them still severer lacerations. But Moses heeded not this, but thought of the creek; and just as he felt the projecting earth giving way beneath him, he loosened his right hand from its hold and with it grappled the Indian by the throat. The latter was now powerless. His eyes shot forth as if to leave their sockets, his face assumed a frightfully fully black and bloated appearance, and it was evident that but a few moments more of such a grasp would end his existence. 
               "Varmint!" exclaimed Moses, at length loosening his hold. "A death by the knife is too good for thee. Thy name? thou wretch of a savage-I know thee of old." 
               "Matonah;" groaned the Indian. 
               "Thou liest." 
               "I swear by the Great Spirit." 
               "Thou liest, I tell thee. Thou art Walking Thunder. Thinkest thou I have forgotten thee? Are not the screamings of slaughtered infants, and the shriekings of murdered women now ringing in my ears, and have I forgotten how justly their blood claims vengeance on Walking Thunder? Thinkest thou to deceive me? Thou deceitful dog-pretended friend of the white man-murdering his wife and children in return for hospitality. What hast thou to say for thyself?" 
               The savage made no reply. 
               "Dost thou not know me." 
               "No," he muttered hesitatingly. 
               "Thou lying"- 
               "Your name is-is"- 
               "Doan-thou lying hypocrite. Dost thou not remember our talk but one week ago, up by the Devils's Half Acre? and thy agreement to betray to me the authors of all the recent depredations? Thou thyself art the prime mover of them I perceive. Were it not for me, this very night thou would'st have lit up the fire of destruction, and imbrued thy hands in the blood of innocent persons. Where are thy comrades?" 
               "They are even now waiting to see the signal of the flames." 
               "Ay, and they will wait I'm thinking. But I had better put thee out of the way, so as to be sure." 
               "I have no wish to live-strike when you will-shunned by my brethern, and suspected by the pale faces-I would rather die." 
               "Thy heart is not in what thee says! thou cunning varmint." 
               "Wherefore should I ask for life? Our birth-right-is gone, our inheritance has been spoiled-our homes laid waste-there is nothing left for the poor Indian. The birds have gone-and the fleet-footed deer no longer bounds fearlessly through our forests-the bear is wandering to the setting sun, and I would fain go to the happy hunting grounds to dwell with my fathers in peace." 
               "Ay, and tell them thou did't not die an honored chief, but a vile, cowardly traitor-a forsworn wretch." 
               "But what signifies that? My life will still be dearly bought-for many a white man's scalp adorns my trappings." 
               And as he spoke the last word, having been long watching his opportunity, he attempted by a dexterous movement of his legs to bring Moses to the ground; but failing, he was only conscious for a moment of a grasping at the throat, as before; and then Doan's sharp and bloodstained steel sank deep into his heart. The blood sprang forth as the weapon was withdrawn, and ran down the bank, mingling with the waters beneath. A groan-a gurgle-a convulsive throe, and Walking Thunder was a corpse. 
               Moses left him there as an example to his comrades, when they came that way; and in order that they might bury him where they pleased. He felt no remorse for what he had done, and when the story became known, many were the praises and commendations he received for ridding the earth of one who was known throughout the States of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as Walking Thunder, the spy of the, Delaware. 
             
             
               CHAPTER V. 
               The Discarded Lover. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "My dreams have boded all too right, 
                           We part-forever part-to night!" 
                        
                      
                     MOORE. 
                   
                
               Moses Doan lost no time in retracing his steps to the home, where slumbered his own beloved Mary. As he hurried along, he thought of the possibility of meeting with another adventure before he reached the house, and cast his keen, eye this way and that way to defect the expected foe. Thoughts also passed through his mind, to the effect that the comrades of the Indian Spy, had surrounded the dwelling, and he worked himself up to a constant expectation of seeing the flames shoot up before him. He drew his knife from its sheath, and shaking it, muttered something about his rifle and redoubled his pace. Woe to the unlucky savage who should then attempt to cross his path. 
               Moses was brave, but somewhat reckless; he was also generous, but when once he had formed an opinion, or made a resolve, neither his generosity nor any earthly power could drive him back from it. These traits in his character have already been powerfully illustrated, and it only remains to observe how much he was under their influence during his whole life, to account for the many strange events which render his history so remarkable. There was an openness and a frankness about him, which always made him an agreeable companion: and no matter whether Moses Doan was friend or foe to any man, that man would be sure soon to know which. What he pretended to be, that he was; and there was no mistaking him. He was not a man of smiles and soft words with venom under his tongue, but plain out-spoken, and true. Such a man was Moses Doan. 
               Arriving at the house, Moses cautiously proceeded to secure his rifle, and see that his noble steed was safe at the gate. He found everything as he had left it, and felt sufficiently free from danger, to call up the object of his visit-the beautiful and lovely being who was now the only hope of the outcast. Accordingly, and also in accordance with preconcerted arrangement, a handful of pebbles were thrown against a certain upper window, which had the effect of soon awakening the fair slumberer, and in a few moments, a head, beautiful as that of an angel looked out upon the soft moonlight. 
               "Is it you Moses?" said a soft melodious voice, rivalling in sweetness the richest tones of ancient Terpsichore; "I did not expect you tonight, though you are ever welcome." 
               "I know it," said Moses with a bow. 
               "I will not keep you waiting," said she, and instantly the little head, with bright blue eyes and crimson lips, withdrew. 
               Oh what a pure and sacred thing is beauty! but joined with virtue, what an angelic being is their possessor! Such an one was Mary. Never yet had the sun shone upon a lovelier, purer maiden. A maiden, light of form as the angels of an infants dream, rich in all of woman's loveliness, before whose bright, blue, pure eyes, vice dare not stand a moment; and whose general countenance never failed to draw forth the admiration of all who looked upon it. 
               Moses waited not long for his loved one. She soon appeared at the door, and with a welcome, such as can only come from a pure and holy heart invited him in. He followed her into the neat little parlor, kept on purpose for the reception of company, whose visits, however, in those days were not very frequent, except, indeed, it might be, a stray traveller or wanderer, or perhaps a friendly Indian, which last though, to tell the truth, was always a rather unwelcome guest. With a politeness and grace which were quite natural, she kindly proffered him a chair into which Doan sank rather heavily, for the desperate encounter he had just been engaged in had a good deal fatigued him. It was one of those good old-fashioned arm-chairs, which our forefathers used to make, as though they were intended to last for eternity; and as Moses placed his elbows on the chair-arms, a glance from Mary, at his somewhat disarranged appearance, instantly detected blood on the sleeve of his coat. 
               "Ah, Moses," said she; "I perceive you have been to another rescue. So many persons will owe you gratitude, that you will soon become completely idolized." 
               "Mary," said Moses, sternly, "is gratitude all with thee!" 
               The fair girl blushed deeply, but gave no immediate answer. The natural gay and lively expression of her face gave place to that of thoughtful solicitude. She seemed to be examining the inmost depths of her heart. She would give him a truthful, and nothing but a truthful answer. Both sat in silence. What a scene was here. Leaning back in his chair was the brave and noble hero, and as he pushed back the dark brown locks from his high, serene forehead, his broad, bold front, attested the immense strength which rested in his frame. Directly facing him sat the lovely maiden, and as she now turned her face upward towards him her dishevelled auburn curls hung confusedly but gracefully around her shoulders. The light of the candle shone fully upon her features, illuminating the snowy whiteness of her well-shaped intellectual brow; and heightening the usual brightness of her sparkling eyes, which were now fixedly set in tenderness upon her lover's countenance as she was about to speak, while the rich ruddy glow upon her cheeks, rivalled that of the fairest of Yemen's celebrated daughters. 
               "You have qualities of heart," said she, "which"-and the sweet expression of her lips and their exquisite color were lost for a moment in confusion, as they tremblingly hesitated to finish the sentence, until at length apparently relieved, she continued, "which no one can help but admire." 
               Mary's eyes immediately glanced to the carpet upon the floor, for she was conscious she had not said exactly what her heart dictated, and she waited doubtingly and anxiously for her lover's reply. The clock in the corner ticked loudly in the silence which ensued, and Moses leaning forward with his elbow on the chair-arm, and his head upon his hand, cast his eyes carelessly towards the candle upon the mantel, evidently not willing to witness her embarrassment. At length, looking intently at a landscape painting which hung against the wall, and wishing to change the subject, he replied- 
               "If so, Mary, thou knowest they belong to my nature; I deserve no credit for them. But I admire nature in that form;" pointing to the picture, "the wide blue river and its grassy banks, yon woody mountain side, and rock-crowned top, the grassy jungle here, where lurk the marks for my trusty rifle, and yon deep black forest, the hunters world, and the future home of Moses Doan. Lovest thou not these things, my Mary?" 
               "Yes, much do I love them; and were I a man, fain would I roam over and through them as you do-to enjoy the exhilarating and healthful excitement of the chase, to be the hero of bold adventures, and to be the savior of the helpless and defenceless. But what mean you by a future home in the forest?" 
               "Just what I say." 
               "But you will not leave your aged father?" 
               "I have already." 
               "Moses!" 
               "Or rather, he has made me leave him. I am an outcast." 
               "For what?" 
               "Because I love those things, which my Mary confesses that she too loves." 
               "I love them truly, but not better than I love my father." 
               "Girl! am I a boy?" 
               "Moses, you are a son." 
               "A son! yes, a son of the wild-woods-Nature's own child, if child I am. If I owe anything as a son, I owe it to Nature; and to Nature will I pay it." 
               "Oh Moses, do not talk so. Your friends-" 
               "Friends! curse their friendship. I have yet to find the first true friend among whites. What think you when my own father turns me out of doors?" 
               "Was there no remedy?" 
               "Yes, there was a remedy. If I'd consent to be his moping slave." 
               "A slave, because you will not be his son. To move a finger is a slavish work if it be done unwillingly. Oh, Moses listen now to one, who thus is forced to feel and to confess she loves you. Your mother is laid low, and oft, perhaps, in hot pursuit of game or foe, you have unconsciously trod over her grave. My father told me this, he knew your mother well, and knows the spot where she was buried. He told me too, that all her fondest hopes centred in you. But now you leave your home, to wander in the forest all your life, an outlaw, and, perhaps leagued with bad men.-What will then become of Moses Doan, and all his mother's hopes?" 
               "I've gone too far to listen now to arguments like these. I can't go back. But no more of this idle talk-I came, my gentle Mary, this fine night for you." 
               "For me! No, never! Right gladly would I go with you, if with me you would go back to your home and father. If it was love for me that brought you here to night, let love persuade you to go back. For your own good, as well as mine, I ask it." 
               "My proud heart's blood, I could pour out for thee, dear girl; but this I cannot do. I would not sacrifice my love of freedom, not even for thee, though thou art the dearest one on earth to me." 
               "Ah! then you love me not. 'Tis but a transient passion that you feel, and if you thus sum up your feelings when freshest and most ardent; what would you say in time, should I be with you in the wild forest, perhaps, in some cave, away from this dear home? Ah! too well I know, you then would say avaunt! and I disgraced and shamed-an outlaw's wife-would not know whither." 
               "By Heavens! I vow it never shall be so." 
               "Yes, true it shall not. You have scorned my love, and though I owe you gratitude, I cannot love you more. Your mother's image creeps in before my fancy, and when I think how her last wish is thwarted, when she hoped that you might be a blessing to your now aged father, I hate you; yes, I hate you." 
               "Such taunts, my girl, could not be uttered with impunity by any one but thee. My mother was a brave and noble woman, and never intended that her eldest son should be more womanly in nature than herself. Now let me talk awhile. My father and me are not to be reconciled, I am driven forth upon the world, an outcast; I have found deception and treachery wherever I have seen a human being, and must I say it-thou too art false. Tell me, then, what remains for me to do but to follow the bent of my own inclination, to try if there be truth in anything in God's universe, and to enjoy that kind of life which nature has fitted me for; seeing that I cannot find enjoyment in anything else!" 
               "But you are too rash, Moses; say not I am false. When you are false to yourself, it is but natural that you should think others false who are still true to you. Be a man-a man of feeling, as well as a man of valor, and you will find, Mary at least will be true to you." 
               "Would I could believe it, but thou hast shaken my faith wonderfully to-night." 
               "You speak cruelly. Have I not owned that I love you?" 
               "Ay, and that thou hatest me as well." 
               "I said if you can wilfully slight a dying mother's wish, I hate you." 
               "Then, thou still lovest me otherwise." 
               "I love you always-ever shall-but 'tis your faults I hate." 
               "Then be my wedded wife.' 
               "If you'll return to your brethren, your home and your father, then I will." 
               "I'll never do that, Mary. No-a life in the wild woods for me." 
               "Then, much as it pains me, Moses, you have my answer." 
               The girl looked upon him with an air of firm determination, her lips were compressed, and her whole manner indicated that she had given a last decisive manner. Yet the womanly feeling of her heart had found its way to her eyes; and spite of all her efforts to keep them back, the crystal tears dropped one by one upon her cheek. 
               A few moments of silent thought had the effect of moistening also the eyes of Moses Doan, and not willing to show this weakness as he considered it, he rose abruptly, took his hat and walked to the door. 
               "Girl!" said he, "then I bid thee a long-a last farewell. A misanthrope is Moses Doan, from this time forth, for ever." 
               The door closed after him, and soon the outer door was heard to open and shut. Mary sank back in her chair, in the acute experience of a sense of utter desolation; tears flowed thick and fast until towards morning, when she retired to her chamber, not, however, to rest, but merely to endeavor to wipe away the traces of her grief. 
               Moses reached his horse, and, mounting in a rage, galloped off, he cared not whither. But soon his thoughts began to circle around the name of Shenoah, and many, many a hearty wish did he express to himself before the morning light, that he could but know where to find that faithful Indian, in order to secure at least, one true companion to stand by him in the adventurous course of life upon which he was about to enter. Nevertheless, his heart beat high at the prospect before him, and he soon forgot the gentle Mary, in the enthusiasm which filled his mind at the thought of being unbridled in his pursuits. Society he scorned, and social laws he defied; his own inclinations and will, were now his only law. 
               Thus, dismissed by his father and discarded by his loved one, he became completely, that, which the treachery of Whites and the cruelty of Indians had for a long time previously predisposed him to. He was now a man-hater, and well had he prepared himself to act out that character. 
               We shall now leave him as the benevolent hero and the lover, to consider him in his more intense and prominent points of character, as MOSES DOAN THE BANDIT. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VI. 
               The Marksman. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "The dawn is breaking o'er us, 
                           See heaven hath caught its hue! 
                           We've day's long light before us 
                           What sport shall we pursue?" 
                        
                      
                     BALLAD. 
                   
                
               After about an hour spent in silent reflection, Moses Doan aroused himself, and patting his horse's neck as he ambled along, began to speculate as to how he should pass the coming day. He had nothing to do with despair; the past two or three hours, it is true, had given him some uneasiness, but his natural blitheness of spirit had returned, and the deep wounds his soul had just now received were effectually healed. Like the inhabitants of the celestial regions, mentioned by Milton, his spiritual nature was so constructed, that no wound, however severe could make any lasting impression upon him, but, on the contrary, immediately healed of its own accord. So in the present instance, and presently his voice echoed through the early morning air, burdened with one of his most joyous and boisterous songs; and every step taken by the noble animal under him seemed to increase his hilarity. The highest enthusiasm seemed to have taken possession of him, caused either by his reckless defiance of the world, or by some new idea which had entered his mind with regard to his prospects. 
               "So ho, my bonny horse!" he exclaimed, bursting out after a few moments of silence, "thou and I will be companions at any rate. Ay, thou art a faithful creature, tried and proved ed; true as the coming of day. The coming of day-yes, its light is already in the east-we have the whole day before us-and now my brave pet, what shall we do? or rather, first, where shall we go? Life is life and I'm bound to enjoy it, and in my own way too-I'll be no sneaking slave at home, no, not I. I would rather roam, houseless, under the spacious canopy of heaven, with yon blue, spangle curtain above and around me, than be the sleekest favorite of my father, to mope away my days at home." 
               Moses here paused, turned his head in a listening position, and by a peculiar twitch of the rein, telegraphed to his horse to move slowly. The animal moved as cautiously as his master could wish, until by another sign, he received the information that his utmost speed was needed. The intelligent creature flew like lightning under the guidance of his now excited rider, and dashed with vehemence close by a certain object, which might have been seen moving through a little copse a short distance ahead. Moses guided his horse in such a manner, as to come slightly in contact with it, when he discovered, much to his sorrow, that he had knocked over a friendly Mingoe Indian, who had on several occasions rendered him important service. However the Indian soon sufficiently recovered from the shock to recognise a former friend in Moses Doan. 
               "Doan not know me?" enquired the Mingoe, "Me know Doan, the brave Tahantsee." 
               "Massaola?" enquired Doan. "I've done thee wrong, brave Indian-my friends are not so many, but that I ought to take better care of them." 
               "Tahantsee good white man, but there be many bad white man. Tahantsee mean no harm. Me not hurt. Me look for two bad white men." 
               "Ay, believe me I like thy tribe better than my own, and thee above all next to the noble Shenoah-but what white men art thou after?" 
               "They live with us-last night they run away; we no find them; they take Massaola's fine rifle, and many things; they rob and then leave. Tahantsee take care-many Indians much angry look for them, and look for you too." 
               "Ha, ha, ha,-Go tell thy brethren I am looking for them; tell them Moses Doan would join them, and that he is-well thou knowest." 
               "Mighty and true;" said Massaola, his eyes glistening with the idea; "but me dare not say-they think me treacherous." 
               "It might be so," remarked Moses Doan thoughtfully, "but," said he, "I have a plan. Thou knowest where I met thee, in the winter time." 
               "Yes." 
               "Then gather thou the chief men of thy tribe, and as you walk where I then walked with thee, I'll meet you there, and then no blame will be attached to thee." 
               "Does Tahantsee mean so." 
               "I do; I would join thy tribe, and I would have thee do as I have told thee." 
               "I will," answered Massaola, and immediately, he set out for that purpose. 
               Among the many ideas which flitted through the brain of Moses Doan, as to how he could best put in practice that vengeance upon which he was bent, came at last, the one just divulged; that of joining a tribe of Indians and using them as instruments to carry out his schemes of hatred. 
               He was well aware of the fact, that the red-skin tribes generally, were continually holding councils to devise means, to keep back the encroachments of the palefaces upon their forests and hunting grounds, and to avenge themselves upon the despoilers of their inheritance. From generation to generation they had been taught that the Great Spirit, when he made the world, had given them the land, the rivers, and the forests for a possession forever; and they viewed any encroachment thereon, not only as an injury to themselves, but as an unpardonable offence against the great Giver. 
               Thus it was, that though disposed to be humane and friendly as long as they held their own domain, they became outrageously cruel and blood thirsty when deprived of it. Vengeance upon the whites, whenever an opportunity offered, was almost their creed, and to this were devoted, almost all the tribes occupying the country, from Lake Erie, eastward, and from the Potomac, northward. 
               What was known as the Lenni Lenappe nation, was composed of some of the most dissatisfied tribes, and means was regularly instituted amongst them for ascertaining wrongs, as well as resenting injuries. Watchful, and suspecting, they were also cruel and unforgiving, and the Wolf or Minisink tribe, belonging to this nation, were particularly noted for their thirst for blood. And yet, when unmolested-no friendship so strong as theirs-none could be depended upon with greater certainty. This tribe was also called the Monsey tribe, and their intensity of character made them known, far and near. Their enmity when aroused was never quenched but with the annihilation of those who were the victims of their anger. Moses Doan had been familiar with them from his earliest years, and it was with them that he had determined to unite himself, for the purpose of carrying out his hatred to mankind. There was a kind of wild daring about their mode of warfare which just suited him, and his mind was fully bent upon stirring them up to immediate acts of violence. No man was better qualified to excite them to avenge their injuries than he who was about to undertake it; none could teach them better the nature of their wrongs than he who was now ready to help them punish the aggressors; and heart and hand, impulse and will, energy and resolution, all were pledged to it by Moses Doan. 
               The sun was just rising, and the birds had taken up their usual morning songs to the great Commander of the universe, when our devotee to revenge, roused from his thoughtful mood by their warblings, issued from a wood and found himself close on to the banks of the Delaware. His horse plunged into the flood and safely bore him to the other side, passing what is now known as Solliday's Island, between that place and Tumble Falls. 
               It would have been very difficult at that time to follow the river, along its western bank, on account of the rough, rocky surface of the ground, and the thick under wood which grew luxuriantly for several miles along that side of the stream. Moses Doan, therefore, thought better to follow a cow path to a short distance inland, where he suddenly turned and passed through the eastern part of Tinicum township, keeping within that range of hills, which rear their heads as if in pride, because of the noble river flowing at their base, until passing through a small portion of Nockamixon township, and following the course of Fall's creek, he came to the Ringing Rocks. These rocks possess a certain peculiarity which render them a great natural curiosity. When struck, they give forth a fine, musical, ringing sound, and as they are in every other respect like other stones, the cause of this singular peculiarity has not yet been ascertained. Moses paused here a while to allow his horse an opportunity to graze a little, as well as to give Massaola time to complete his arrangements for their appointed meeting. 
               From this spot, after the lapse of about an hour, he proceeded to the river side, and wending his way northward, came to that huge pile of Nature's architecture, generally called the Grand Rocks, which rises to the height of three hundred and sixty feet from the river bank, and which considered, with its surroundings, will favorably compare with the far famed Shakespeare's Cliff, which overlooks the straits of Dover. 
               In passing near the Narrows, Massaola and his party were seen coming towards him, they having just passed what is now called Linn's Falls. There were about fifteen Indians in all, and as they approached, Moses heard them conversing rather loudly and excitedly. They spoke the Algonquin dialect, with which he was somewhat familiar, and he could interpret some sentences that were passing between them, as threats upon his Indian friend, in case it should prove that he was leading them into danger, instead of conducting them as he had promised, to a friendly talk with the great Tahantsee. 
               At length they stopped within a few yards of the great white chief, as they called him, and sent Massaola forward, as interpreter, to know what he would say. Moses seeing this, immediately beckoned to the whole party to advance, but they refused. 
               "My true friend, Massaola!" exclaimed he as the Indian extended his hand, "Why do not thy comrades come?" 
               "They send me first to know what you would say to them. I dare not say you speak true until you speak again." 
               "Tell them as thou seest-I now lay down my arms-tell them Moses Doan says he would join them to punish their enemies." 
               When Massaola had delivered this message they came near, and Moses to manifest his good feeling, shook hands with them all round. 
               "It is wonderful," said they through their interpreter, "that our great enemy wishes to join us and fight for us." 
               "The pale faces are treacherous and deceptive," answered Moses, "but the Mingoes and Monseys have always been true to me." 
               "But why leave your home, your father and your brethren, to come with strangers?" 
               "My home is your home-my home is everywhere-my father has cast me out, because I love an Indian's life-but my brothers, they will be with me ere yet a moon shall waste. I sympathise with the poor Indian-his land is gone, his home is broken up. I will aid you in the work of revenge! Have you not yet the tomahawk, the torch and the scalping knife to aid you?" 
               "But we are weak, and the palefaces are becoming coming powerful while we are wasting-we have no hope." 
               "Never despair! Fight on, and the Great Spirit will bless your bravery. I hate and despise the race of whites, but I love the Indian-I will go with you-I will be friend to your friend and foe to your foe-I will be true to you till death-by the Great Spirit I swear it." 
               At this they made almost frantic demonstrations of joy, and began to criticise, in their native dialect, the faultless form, and great muscular power apparent in the stout make of their new brother; and with loud yells of satisfaction turned about and pursued their way with him, to the northward. 
               The sun was just about taking his leave of the mountain tops, when they arrived at a beautiful spot on the banks of the Muskonetong creek, where all the richness of autumnal foliage with its variegated hues, combined with the solemn pomp of primeval forest trees in their lofty and spreading symmetry, to reflect a picture of some delicious, untouched hunting ground, in the calm, still water that laid like a silvery sheet beneath. 
               A little north of this stream, and not far from the Delaware, is a cave, which has been called the Devil's Hole. When they had arranged to encamp for the night in the spot above mentioned, Moses Doan in straying around came upon this cave, and determined to explore it; as he had in his mind an idea that he might some time want to make some underground cavern his habitation. Accordingly he descended into it and found it quite spacious, but entirely unfit to inhabit, on account of the great depth of water with which the bottom was covered. 
               While Moses was in the cave, the Indians, who had suddenly missed him, began to suspect foul play; but Massaola quieted their fears by producing the weapons which he had left with them, and pointing to his horse, which was tied fast to a neighboring tree. Soon, however, their white brother made his appearance and explained the reason of his absence, when all fears subsided, and he was admitted at once and for all to their eternal friendship. 
               The Indians now busied themselves in preparing for the camp fire, and our would-be troglodyte, looked around upon the landscape, until his eyes became fixed for a moment upon Rattle Snake Hill, a short distance below. His memory had just began to recall one of his exploits enacted in that locality, when he suddenly bethought him of his rifle, for which he knew not where to look. What he wanted was soon ascertained by Massaola; and as he handed it to him, told him that his comrades were anxious to see him shoot. Moses told them to put up a mark, and all should try their skill. 
               A tree was immediately singled out, and one hundred paces measured off from it. A round piece of bark, about four inches in diameter, was then fastened to the tree with the white side out, by a wooden pin, the head of which would scarcely measure a quarter of an inch across. 
               The chief of the party fired first, striking the piece of bark near the edge; the three next that fired struck the tree, and now it came to Moses's turn. He, however, gave place to Massaola, as he had not yet fired, and was known to be a good marksman. His mark came a little inside of the chief's, and the bullet was imbedded in the bark. 
               Doan now took the rifle, and with a steady aim touched for the mark. All ran to the tree to ascertain the result; and it was soon to be seen upon their countenances. Consternation at first made them look solemn and grave, but on their shouts of applause rang loud and shrill through the valley, and they danced with delight as they came forward to congratulate him. He had shivered the small wooden pin into splinters!
                
               "Could you do that again?" asked Massaola. 
               "Yes," answered Moses. 
               "They say it only happened so." 
               "I can soon teach them better than that. Tell them to put in another pin." 
               Doan again loaded his gun; and another pin fastened the mark to the tree. The well-tried rifle was again brought to his shoulder and fired. Swiftly and truly the flying bullet sped to its mark; the Indians ran to look, and behold! the wooden pin was split in two!
                
               Again the rocks resounded with their shrill shouts of applause; and admiringly they gathered around their newly found friend, whom, up to their meeting in the morning, they had always considered a most bitter enemy. 
               The next morning they continued their march, amusing themselves by the way in chasing deer, shooting game, wrestling, and other exercises. Thus they went on for several days until at length they reached the celebrated valley of Wyoming. 
               This beautiful valley, afterwards the scene of the cruel and bloody massacre of its inhabitants, which is related in history, was at this time but very sparsely settled with whites, and was almost solely in the possession of the Indians of the six nations. The women cultivated corn upon the plains, the men travelled the surrounding mountains, covered with lofty forests in pursuit of game, and the river supplied an abundance of fish. It was, indeed, a beautiful valley, and presented many a fair and lovely landscape. 
                      
                        "On Susquehanna's side, fair Wyoming! 
                        Although the wild flower o'er thy ruin'd wall, 
                        And roofless homes, a sad remembrance bring, 
                        Of what thy gentle people did befall; 
                        Yet thou went once the loveliest land of all 
                        That see the Atlantic wave their morn restore." 
                     
                  
                
               Here on the verdant and ever pleasant banks of the Lackawannock creek they rested, and were soon visited by a party of Delawares, with whom they continued for a while, and joined in their sports and pursuits. 
               It was at this time, and among these new acquaintances that Moses Doan for the first time in his life met with an equal in any gymnastic exercise. In wrestling he was always sure to come off conqueror, and in this exercise none could withstand him, neither Indian or white-Several came forward, and as many gave way under the force of his herculean power, directed by well practised skill. At length the well-known, strong, robust and active Lockawalon, whose acknowledged superiority had hitherto caused him to disdain a trial with the strange pale face; after witnessing his several victories, became excited, and intimated that he was ready to measure strength with him. Doan eyed him for a moment from head to foot, and in less than a moment calculated that it would take his utmost, even perhaps to hold his own. The crowd of Indians immediately closed around forming a ring, in which face to face stood the white and the red wrestler. The struggle is begun, and the bodies of the contestants are writhing about violently, and passing rapidly from one contorted position to another. The chances of victory were about equal for some time, till Doan applying one of his peculiar maneuvres for which he was so celebrated, doubled his opponent backward, and by a sudden movement threw him to some distance, upon the ground. The vanquished Indian immediately gave up his laurels, and as soon as he could rise, extended his hand in token both of his defeat and his friendship. 
               But the Indian had not done yet. He had been conquered in wrestling, but his fame for leaping had never yet been impaired. Doan accepted his proposal to leap with him, and from his success in former matches, made sure of coming out right in this. Yet it did not happen so. 
               Lockawalon ran, but losing force before he came to the mark from whence he was to spring, his jump did not satisfy him; however, he sat down to await the result. It was a wonderful leap notwithstanding, and Moses, in his trail, came to it exactly a tie. A second effort for both parties was now necessary in order to decide between them; and this bring agreed upon, Moses leaped first, and came a foot beyond the first mark, the bystanders now, evidently setting him down as the victor. The Indian came after him with the speed of an arrow, and with one tremendous bound, cleared Doan's last mark by about the same distance that he had cleared the first! Moses owned himself beaten, and as he viewed the ground, his countenance revealed how deeply he felt it. He afterwards declared that he did not believe that man ever lived, who could beat Lockawalon at leaping. 
               Soon after this, Moses Doan, being reminded of his promise to bring his brothers to join the remnant of the Mingoes, returned home for his brother Levi whom he took with him; and both became much dreaded by the white inhabitants to a considerable distance westward, but more particularly along the banks of the Susquehanna. 
               Very little is known of them from this time until the breaking out of the Revolutionary War; when in connection with others of their kindred and character, they formed a band, acting principally on the side of the British, although on one or two occasions, they acted, and justly too, in opposition, even to them. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VII. 
               Tidings of War. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "I'll be a warrior, yes; 
                           And then suppose they scar me, 
                           'Twill make them think I ought to be 
                           A captain in the army." 
                        
                      
                     OLD PLAY. 
                   
                
               It was the winter of 1775. A cold blustery night had set in, the snow was on the ground to the depth of some inches, and the winds were making a shrill loud noise, as they rushed through the trees and over the lawn, driving the storm in all directions. A farm house stood on a little eminence not far from Fisherville, and within were rather an elderly man, and his good wife, snugly seated before the cheerful fire which was blazing brightly upon the hearth. Busily the matron's fingers plied over her work, while her husband sat in a stooping position, evidently engaged in deep and earnest thought. 
               Already had the tales of battle and murder which marked the progress of the revolution, been circulated in the neighborhood. The people ple had been aroused from their wonted sense of security, by accounts of high-handed lawlessness, and bloodshed, perpetrated by the King's troops on unoffending citizens, and when the words Lexington and Bunker Hill were repeated in connection with these accounts, the hardy, noble-formed youths of that day, became fired with enthusiasm for the battle field, and fair maidens applauded the chivalrous determination of their lovers by loveliest looks and sweetest smiles. 
               Yet war was not popular among certain classes of people in certain localities, and many there were, who, notwithstanding all the wrongs which they suffered, and all the cruelties which they believed were being practised by their oppressors, took up the royal cause, and endeavored to dissuade others from any opposition thereto. Members of one family were divided; some supported the cause of the colonies, and others that of the King. Many a home was by this means broken up, and in some cases, fathers were betrayed by their sons, and sons by their fathers, so bitter was the feeling on either side. 
               Such was the case with the family of Thomas Doan, whom, in connection with his estimable lady, we just now introduced. The course his son Abraham, was likely to pursue with regard to the war question, was the subject which we left him so intently thinking about, and so wholly absorbed over. There the two had been sitting for more than an hour, and not a word had passed between them. The old lady began to think it was now about time to say something, and putting her spectacles up over her eyes, she took a full view of her partner, up and down, and then quietly putting her spectacles down again, went on with her work. 
               "Thomas," said she, after having taken about a dozen stitches, "is thee sick?" 
               "Well, no!" said Thomas, without ever raising his head. 
               "What is the matter with thee? What art thee studying about?" 
               "The war." 
               "Pooh-the war-It'll come to nothing. Thee is not going to turn rebel, I hope?" 
               "No, but Abraham is." 
               "Nonsense! Thee don't talk to him enough." 
               "I've talked to him enough to know that he is going to be a man of blood!" 
               "What! Abraham?" 
               "Ay, our Abraham. Does thee know where he is now?" 
               "No, Where?" 
               "I'm sure I can't tell thee; but he ain't out this stormy night, for any good." 
               "Quiet thy fears, man. He won't go against his mother." 
               "I hope not, but I can't help fearing otherwise." 
               "What is then to be done?" asked she, alarmed at the tone of her husband's last answer. 
               "I can't tell. He seems to be running like his cousin Moses. They are enough alike to be twins, and I don't think there's a pin difference in their dispositions." 
               At this moment the sound of Abraham's voice floated faintly by, upon the wind, and presently, the words of one of the many revolutionary songs of that day, were distinctly heard, as he neared the door. 
               "He's coming now, wife;" said Thomas, "if thee thinks thee can do anything with him, thee had better take him in time." 
               "May God preserve him from becoming such an one as Moses;" ejaculated his wife, with great earnestness. 
               "Yea, and so pray I;" answered Thomas. 
               The words had been scarcely spoken, when the door was opened and the subject of their conversation entered, and knocking the snow from his shoes, he went and sat down on the bench by the fire. His father sat opposite to him, with his face between his hands, while his mother kept to her work without saying a word, in the corner to his right. 
               Although the resemblance between Moses and Abraham Doan, was very striking, even so much so, that one could scarcely tell them apart, their dispositions in many respects were far from being similar. Moses was the superior of the two. There were about him some good qualities of character, which eminently fitted him to be a ruler of other men. It was the recognition of his superiority, perhaps, which prevailed upon Abraham to allow him the undisputed command of the whole party with which they were afterwards associated; for Abraham was of a proud and ambitious spirit, and it is even to this day contended, that it was he that commanded the band. But this was not so, as many an act of mercy was done by the chief of that band, which Abraham was too cruel and relentless to allow. Moses planned the attack, Abraham was the first to strike the blow. Moses always dealt magnanimously with his enemies, was ever the friend and protector of helpless women and children, and no act of violence did he ever engage in, where the parties attacked had not the means to defend themselves. But Abraham on the contrary seemed to delight in the weakness and unprotected state of those he attacked, and to him must be attributed the cruel and inhuman treatment of defenceless women, which constitutes the darkest, blackest part of the whole history of the foul and wicked deeds of the Doans. 
               Abraham had just been listening to harangues at the store, in which the wrongs of the American people had been strongly portrayed, and the cry for liberty had been responded to with heartfelt enthusiasm by the people present. The latent spark of love for freedom which had existed in the public mind, had now grown into a glowing fire; and only needed to be fanned by actual opposition, to cause it to burn with a fierce and vivid flame. The stamp act, and other odious measures of the royal tyrant, had long been the topic of conversation by the family fire-side, and in all public gatherings, and the hearts of thousands beat high to take part in the mighty struggle which Congress had now determined upon for liberty and independence. "God and my Right," was the soul inspiring motto, which transformed the weak nerves, even of women into metal; and made mighty men doubly mighty when once they clasped the sword. 
               The American Revolution rose out of the ocean of superstitious oppression, a little cloud no larger than a man's hand; but ever since has it rained upon an almost famished world the invaluable fruits of liberty. Human improvement then took a mighty step, and human destiny, a course whose grandeur is yet in its infancy. Next to the redeeming of a world from sin, was this redeeming of a world from tyranny. 
               It is no wonder that a youth like Abraham, of excitable temperament, enthusiastic and brave-it is no wonder that he should have been marvelously worked upon, by the soul-stirring circumstances continually brought before him; although his parents had constantly endeavored to impress upon him that implicit loyalty was his duty. As the young man and his parents sat there, that stormy night, each one entirely ignorant of what was passing in the others mind; little did the latter think it would be the last time they would be together as they were then. 
               Abraham sat some minutes, looking into the fire, with his head upon his hand, and then made a move to put off his shoes. The old lady took advantage of the moment, and in a careless manner asked- 
               "Where has thee been so late to-night, Abraham?'" 
               "Oh, just over to the store." 
               "What takes thee there so much? Does thee go to the store every night?" 
               "Yes, to hear the news." 
               "What news?" 
               "About the war. I guess I'd like to go, but-" 
               "But what?" 
               "My rifle ain't hardly in trim to start to-night." 
               "To start to-night! Thee had better stay at home Abraham, and then thee wouldn't get such foolish whims into thy head," 
               "Not so foolish, either. Think I'd stand by, and see them red-coats plundering everywhere, and cutting up our people, and then do nothing?" 
               "Thee must wait patiently, as we shall, and all will be right." 
               "I'll wait just as long till I get my rifle ready, and no longer." 
               "Abraham!" said his mother, giving him a long and searching look; "has thee got a mother?" 
               "Ay, and will fight to protect her." 
               "Thee is wrong, my boy. Thee knows thou wert brought up a friend, and a friend never fights." 
               "No I ain't wrong; 'tis thee don't understand it, mother." 
               "Thee must allow boy, that thy parents know more than thee, and we advise thee to go to bed now, as it is getting late, and think over what thou wilt come too." 
               "I'll join the army, and get a few scratches, and then I'll be a captain or something else, and Abraham Doan will be somebody in the world." 
               "Thee certainly art beside thyself, Abraham, to talk so, thee had better go to bed." 
               "Ay, and be up early to fodder the cattle," added Thomas, as he disappeared at the shutting of the stairfoot door. 
               Abraham had gone up stairs, but he was in no hurry to go to bed. He spent the night in preparing for a start from home, and every word his parents had said to him, only added to the intensity of his desire to be off. He was not solely actuated by patriotic motives, although these had at present, perhaps, the greater influence over him, but a hope of self-aggrandizement had entered his heart, and it did not require much persuasion, to make this hope supersede the most earnest and zealous of his patriotic emotions. 
                
               The old people on the other hand, retired with heavy hearts, they had found that all they could say was not going to turn him from his determination to join the rebels, and their only hope of his relinquishing that determination, consisted in the meagre probability that reflection would turn his mind. But had they known that within a few short hours from the time he sat upon the bench that night, he was to become the companion of his already notorious cousin Moses, their grief would have been too severe for them to silently bear. Not dreaming but that on the morrow, at any rate, they could prevail upon him to stay at home, they contented themselves for the present with what had been said; and soon the destiny of their boy was forgotten, while "tired nature's sweet restorer," came upon them in soundest slumbers. 
               But the light still burned in Abraham's room, and a person at the door might have heard a rubbing, scouring and clicking, which would have given him an idea of something going on within, very far different from what might have been expected, if the occupant had retired to rest. The old clock below in the kitchen, which struck the quarter, had just given him notice that it was half-past eleven, and the next minute, his room door opened, and he glided softly down the stairs fully equipped, according to his notion, for the battle-field. 
               The embers were still glowing on the hearth, when he arrived below, and putting them together with a fresh stick of wood, he sat down upon the bench, to consider as to the course he had better take. 
               "Well, I reckon the old folks 'ill miss me in the morning," said he to himself, "but when I come back I'll make things all right; but that won't be until I've made some of them confounded Britishers, taste a little lead out of my rifle, and obtained a little plunder by it. Who knows but some day I may be a captain, with soldiers to command, and then wouldn't old Thomas be proud of me. I've a deuced good mind to get up a little band of my own, and- 
               "Knock, knock, knock," came a fist at the door. 
               "Who's there at this time o'night," growled Abraham, as he rose from his seat. 
               Hastily he unbarred the door and opened it, when appeared to his utter surprise the well-known, yet almost forgotten form of Moses Doan. 
               "Hilloa Moses! who would have thought thee woulds't a been here this time o'this stormy night. Shake hands-how's times with thee?" 
               "Well enough, my Hearty," responded Moses; "How with thee?" 
               "Well, I'm off for the war." 
               "I see thou art accoutred for something," replied Moses eyeing him. "What does thee mean to do?" 
               "Why to fight the thieving, blood-thirsty British to be sure." 
               "Thee knows nothing about it Abe; doesn't thee know that Congress taxes the people more n'r ever the British did. When thee fights, thee had better fight for thy own interest, lad." 
               "To be sure-I don't want to fight for nothing." 
               "Well then, thee take the side of the British, which is the right side anyhow, and thee can'st plunder when thee pleasest and get rich in no time. Besides, the King's troops will protect thee, whereas, if thou art a rebel, what soldiers have they to encourage thee, or what chance wilt thou have to make anything by thy courage." 
               "There is something in that; but is thee sure about the tax?" 
               "Ay, and more than that. The law is, if the tax is not paid within ten days, to support these rebels, the lands we've tilled these many years are to be taken from us." 
               "Then I'm in for King George." 
               "Not too fast. I ain't in for King George, either. I want freedom, but I want it without taxation." 
               "Ay, and so do I," responded Abraham.-"But how are we to go about getting it." 
               "The way is easy, Abe. Thee knows all is fair in war. Can't we form a little independent party of our own, plunder where we choose, and do just as we please-that is enjoy freedom while they are fighting about it." 
               "Capital, Mose; and now we'll take a drink on the strength of the proposition." 
               'Taint only proposition," rejoined Moses; "Myself, Levi, and Aaron have already put it into practice." 
               "Thee can reckon on Abe then-and I'm bound too, to go with thee to-night." 
               So saying Abraham took the candle and descended into the cellar; soon returning with a jug of good cider. Each drank a toast to their new enterprise; and as the old clock rung out the hour of twelve, the two cousins issued from the house, and directed their steps through the storm, to the spot which Moses had for the present ent chosen as a place of rendezvous. The feathery-fleece of heaven still descended in large flakes, and the loud rushing winds soon filled up all traces of their footsteps, as it swept over the snow-clad earth behind them. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VIII. 
               An Expedition. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "And we'll take another quaff, ere we go, boys, go: 
                           We'll take another quaff ere we go." 
                        
                      
                     SONG OF THE BATTLS EVE. 
                   
                
               While Moses Doan was paying this visit to Abraham, his brothers Aaron, Levi, Mahlon and Joseph, the latter two without his knowledge of their having been persuaded to join his party, were patiently awaiting his arrival among them at the place of rendezvous. He should have been there long before, but it appears that Moses in passing near the house of Thomas Doan, had discovered the light on the kitchen window, and thinking that it would be a good chance to see Abraham, with a view to bring him over to join his party, he paid him the visit we have mentioned. 
               The brothers had been carousing, and drinking pretty freely, and becoming impatient at Moses' delay, began to speculate on the propriety of making a first adventure on their own hook. The question now came up, as to who they should attack, so as to safely get off with their plunder. Various persons were proposed in that immediate neighborhood, but Joseph having a little more caution than the rest, intimated that that would probably lead to a search for their quarters, even if they were successful, and then, they would inevitably fall into the hands of the rebels. It was then proposed to go on the other side of the Delaware, as the river was at that time frozen over, and commence operations wherever they found a good opportunity, and where they thought they would get paid for their trouble. 
               "One more drink boys and then we will be off," said Mahlon. 
               "Let's have another song," said Levi. 
               "We've got no time now," replied Mahlon, "we got nothing to sing about-Let's sing afterwards." 
               "I know a sorry old sinner," chimed in Aaron, "one that's got the tin too. A rank rebel, who is always talking about his money and the British." 
               "Well, Aaron, I move to make thee captain, as long as Moses ain't here," said Joseph. 
               "That's agreed," said the rest with one voice, and all made for their rifles and knives. 
               "Hold on boys, we'll take another drink," said Mahlon, and soon the liquor was passed around, after which they all started out, striking up a drinking song, which their united voices raised above the noise of the loud tempest which prevailed. 
               Just about the time that Moses and Abraham started from the house of old Thomas Doan, this party sallied forth upon their expedition.-Their place of meeting was not far from the river, and before the former two arrived there, the latter were over in Jersey. 
               As soon as they got across the river, they struck for the home of the old rebel mentioned by Aaron. The storm commenced to go down, and an opportunity was thus afforded for uninterrupted conversation as they went along. 
               "Wonder where Moses can be to-night," remarked Aaron, "I'll be bound he's out on some game, somewhere." 
               "I left directions on the wall about where we are going," said Joseph, "and I shouldn't be surprised to find him there before we get through." 
               "Likely enough," said Mahlon' "but Moses never comes home late, unless he's made something. Mark my words, he wont come home empty handed." 
               "There's the house," said Aaron, "now boys for fun and profit. 
               "How many people's in it?" enquired Joseph. 
               "Only an old rebel and his daughter; thee knows 'em, Joe." 
               "I guess Moses knows 'em better n'r I do," answered Joseph, looking wise. 
               "I guess so," returned Aaron significantly. 
               By this time they were proceeding up the lane, and one of them perceived a light at one of the windows. 
               "There's somebody up, I guess," said Aaron, "but anyhow boys we're in." 
               And with that he caught up an axe that was laying on the wood pile, and with two or three blows knocked in the, door. 
               "Now boys, come and have supper," said he as he cooly walked into the house. 
               "Let's see who's up stairs first," he added, as he suited the action to the word with a vigorous bound. 
               His comrades were at his heels and entering the first room he came to, he discovered a neatly dressed but affrighted young girl, in a position tion as though in the act of defending some person in the bed behind her. A deep and heavy groan was the first sound which greeted their ears, as they entered, and then a shriek from the lovely girl, who, however, did not leave the bedside. 
               "Thee art wanted to get supper," said Aaron taking hold of her arm rudely, and dragging he towards the light. 
               "There take that light," he added, "and be quick about it." 
               "Do so, Mary," groaned out the old man, who was evidently very sick. 
               "None of thy foxing, old fellow; we want thee to jump around too. Where's the key of thy coffers?" 
               The old man said nothing but still groaned. 
               Mary took the light and went down stairs Joseph and Mahlon following her to get the whiskey. 
               "Does thee hear?" persisted Aaron. 
               "Who are you?" 
               "That's none o' thy business." 
               "Thee must come out o' this, old punkinsides," said Levi giving him a jerk, which fetched him out upon the floor; "thee means to take supper with us, I suppose?" 
               "Do you come here in the name of the King, or of the Congress, thus to attack a poor sick man, in his own house." 
               "Thee has found thy tongue has thee?" sneeringly enquired Aaron; "Well, we come in the name of Doan; and we want some of them semblances of King George, of which thou hast plenty stored by, but with which thou hast no business, seeing that thou art a rebel." 
               "Come hurry up, I'm hungry," said Levi, and the old man speedily dressed himself, after which they escorted him down stairs. 
               When they had bound him with cords in his old arm chair below, they hurried back to the room, taking with them the axe with which Aaron had broken in the door. But a moment sufficed to smash in the bureau, which they suspected contained the treasure. Nor were they disappointed, for in one corner they soon found the bag that contained the shining gold. With spirits full of glee, they were now bent on a general carouse before they left the house, and as they were now all assembled in the kitchen, the fun began. It was about two o'clock in the morning when they sat down to their meal, after which they shared out the money, and then being pretty much under the influence of whiskey, the whole party decided to serve out the old man a little for his obstinacy, in not telling them where to find the treasure. 
               Placing themselves equally on each side of the old man's chair, each party took hold of one end of the rope with which he was bound, and the object was, to try which party could pull the chair to their side of the kitchen. In vain the old man groaned and his daughter protested, the tightening cords were not allowed to slacken for a moment. At length having played at this game till they were tired, they looked about for some other means by which to torture him. 
               Mary had been using a large flat, round bake-iron in preparing the meal, which was still on the fire, with a cake of bread upon it, and which of course, was exceedingly hot. They had scarcely taken breath from their first cruel exercise, when Levi's eyes caught sight of the iron. Catching it up and slinging the hot bread right into the old man's face, he placed the iron directly under his feet, remarking that he was going to teach the old rebel to dance.-Directly his feet came in contact with the heated iron, the old man uttered the most piercing cries, while Mary instinctively sprang forward to take it away, but instantly fell in a swoon.-Two of them took her up and laid her to one side, while one of them imprinted a rude kiss upon her colorless lips. A death-like paleness had been spread over her face from the time they first entered the house, but now her visage was ghostly, and wore upon it the evidences of a rage, she was powerless to satisfy. 
               Still the shrieks of the old man resounded through the house, and still, they whistled and laughed alternately, to the action of his feet upon the heated iron. 
               All at once the sound of horses' hoofs was heard, and as they looked out at the door, two horsemen were seen coming speedily up the lane. 
               "There are but two of them," said Levi, "and there are four of us-who cares!" 
               'Tis Moses!" said Joseph. 
               "And his cousin Abraham;" added Mahlon. 
               "Hello boys!" said Moses, as he came up, "what the deuce is all that noise about in there?" 
               "Fun," said Levi. 
               "It sounds like fun," replied Moses, as he dismounted. 
               By this time Mary had sufficiently recovered to be conscious that she heard a well known voice, and gaining new strength thereat, she rushed to the door. 
               "Oh; Moses! Moses!" she cried, "you are the author of all this. These villains are you brothers, and-" 
               Turning suddenly around, she recollected the condition of her father, and instantly seizing the iron from his burned feet, flung it with great force over the heads of the astonished Doans, far out into the snow. 
               "Shame on you all," said Moses. "to attack an old man, unable to defend himself. Cut those cords loose this instant; I have other work for you, than murdering helpless age, and robbing defenceless women." 
               His command was instantly obeyed; and Mary rushing to him, throwing her fair white arm a about his neck, and scarcely knowing what she was doing, covered his face with kisses. Suddenly recollecting herself however, she recoiled from him, and in an agonizing tone, exclaimed- 
               "Oh Moses! how can one so noble, associate with such ruffians, even though they are brothers." 
               "Mary," said he, "I am an outlaw; it was once in thy power to save me at least from this extremity, but now-never. But boys," he continued, turning to his brothers, "we must be off, or daylight will find us in the wrong place," and remounting his horse he galloped away, the others following him, and thus ended the first of their lawless expeditions, as a band. 
               The broken lid of the old bureau is still preserved, by the descendants of the family, whose house they first plundered. 
               For some time they rode along in silence, the plunderers being dissatisfied with the manner in which Moses had shown his authority among them. Men who have taken up the outlaw's life, generally take to themselves also, a spirit that cannot very well brook rebuke, and the silence which had prevailed, how began to be broken with low murmurs, and half suppressed curses against their captain. Moses could not help but see that discontent was growing fast towards actual resistance of his authority, and, knowing that nothing short of a close prospect of gain, would be likely to bring them to, he set about planning some adventure by which he could promise them a good and speedy return. 
               "Boys," said he, after a while, "I know where we can make a good thing of some capital horses. If you'll assist, I'll engage you shall have money in your pockets from the proceeds within forty-eight hours." 
               "Curse the horses," said Aaron, crabbedly; "thee'll get us all strung up by the neck, before we go much further. If thee is going to act like thee did just now, we'd better break up, or else find another captain-that's my mind." 
               "Hold in, Aaron," rejoined Joseph, "if thee can't understand that matter, I can. I say, let's go in for the horses." 
               "Love in a tub and the bottom fell out thee knows," said Levi, with a significant wink.-"Let's all go in for the horses." 
               "Well, let it all pass," said Mahlon, "there's no use in kicking up a row about nothing. I'm in for the horses." 
               "Well, I suppose I'll have to go in too," said Aaron, rather morosely, "but I don't want his love scrapes to interfere with our fun again, that's all." 
               Moses was about to make answer, but probably reflecting that it was better to let well enough alone, he wisely refrained. Therefore, as all were willing, he proceeded to give them directions as to the precise spot where the horses were, and how to proceed to effect their safe capture. 
               Himself and Abraham had some time during the night, held conversation with a man, who was to take three splendid horses to Philadelphia that morning, from some place in the township of Bedminster. He was to be at a certain place at a certain time, and it was planned by Moses to intercept him before he arrived at that place. Dividing his band into three parties he started them different ways, each party to secure a horse, and meet in a certain piece of woods on the East on Road. Before nine o'clock that morning, the men and two of the horses were at the appointed place, but Moses and Abraham, were missing. Before ten o'clock however they came in sight, each one with a horse besides his own. 
               "Look here, boys," said Moses, exhibiting a well filled wallet, "I guess we'll do for a little while now." 
               "Where did thee come across that?" asked Aaron. 
               "Cousin Abe here, left the poor fellow in the road, dead or alive I don't know; and we thought t' would be no harm to see what he'd got about him." 
               "How did it happen, Abe? Thee must be pretty good metal." 
               "Oh, he got rather stubborn, after having lost two of his horses, and I had to knock him." 
               "The animals are noble ones," remarked Moses. "How do you like your trip boys?" 
                
               "A pretty good haul, but what are we to do with the horses!" asked Aaron. 
               "Just take them back into the woods a piece till night, and then fetch them along to the city; I'll meet you there, and then leave the rest to me. Keep close, boys." 
               And Moses as soon as he had said this, sped off towards the city; leaving Abraham with the rest of the party. The latter spent their time all day long in the woods, at a good distance from the road: and having made a fire, and completed other fixtures for their comfort, passed the time away in merry carousals, and vociferous glee. 
               About an hour before midnight they took up their course for the city, each one starting a little ahead of the other; the first four each man with an additional horse, and Abraham bringing up the rear, to settle any little difficulty that might occur to them along the road. In this manner they proceeded till they arrived with the horses safely within the city, where Moses met them according to promise, and before daylight, by means of a previous arrangement made by him, the horses were disposed of at very fair prices, considering the circumstances. 
               Their success thus far made them still more anxious for other adventures, and seemed to reconcile them inseparably to their new mode of life. 
             
             
               CHAPTER IX. 
               Nearly an Equal. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "Soon will his murderous band be here!- 
                           Hush! heardst thou not the tramp of men 
                           Sounding aloud from yonder glen." 
                        
                      
                     THE GHEEERS. 
                   
                
               In a low groggery in Second street, below Pine, Philadelphia, Moses Doan and his band were staying, squandering away their ill-gotten gains. Many were the ruffians and desperadoes that passed in and out, and much did Moses scan their characters and general physical qualities, with a view of increasing his force, by adding to it every available man who possessed the requisite qualifications. 
               It was here that the Bucks county brigand first formed the acquaintance of that heartless desperado, of Chester county, whose proper name was James Fitzpatrick, but who was more generally known by the Abbreviation, Fitz. This fellow was one of the very basest sort, much more abandoned, reckless, and lawless in his disposition than Moses himself, and utterly given ever to every species of injustice, vice and cruelty. 
               Doan's attention was irresistibly drawn towards him, and his eagle-eye at once sought out the physical advantages of his robust frame; as for instance, his broad and lion-like chest, the large muscular developments of his arm, and the general activity of limb he evidenced at every motion. Satisfied with regard to his admirable make, and with the many prominent proofs of extraordinary strength, he now sought an opportunity to look into his eyes, to fathom his disposition and character, by those unerring indications of the desires and intentions of the soul. 
               Fitz had observed the attention paid to him by the noble-looking stranger, and walking up to the bar, enquired of the landlord- 
               "Who is that rough-looking, lubberly customer in the corner there?" 
               "My name is Doan," said Moses sharply, "and I may have to show thee that I am just as rough as I look to be." 
               "Keep cool, hairy face," replied Fitz, "or you may get into a bad bargain." 
               "Bad or good, I'm ready for it;" sharply returned Moses. 
               "I guess you're rather green, and don't know who you're talking to." 
               "Who cares?" 
               "Well, just be easy now, or I'll show you what Jim Fitzpatrick has shown to lubbers like you, a hundred times over." 
               "Well, what's that?" 
               "Just that;" answered Fitz, shaking his huge fist, "and that a little closer to your eyesight than would be good for you, I tell you." 
               "There's as good a one," returned Moses, placing his fist right in the other's face. 
               "You will fight then, eh?" and immediately Fitz made a strike which would have been almost a death-blow had it met its mark. 
               But Moses dexterously warded it off, and instantly the bystanders cried- 
               "A ring! a ring! make a ring! fair play!" A ring was formed, the toe-marks made upon the floor, and at it they went. It was no common contest-such as often occurs in such places between drunken men. Neither of them was much under the influence of liquor, and both were champions of their respective neighborhoods. As the fight went on and each found his aims baffled by the other, their rage proportionately increased, till their eyes seemed almost to dart fire at each other, with the fury of their excitement. At length a stunning, crashing blow, struck with almost the force of the sledge he was accustomed to wield, from the clenched hand of Fitz, took effect upon the cheek of Doan, causing him to stagger for a moment or two; but renewing the attack with still greater vigor than before, he suddenly clasped his antagonist around the waist as with a vice, but the other's arms being still at liberty, grasped him in the same manner; and now began the most terrible part of the struggle. Not a sound was heard but the quick panting of the angry contestants. Suddenly-quick as a flash, a mighty effort by Moses brought them both down with a heavy fall to the floor. 
               "The Doan is uppermost!" shouted the bystanders. "Go in Doan!" "I'll bet on Doan!" "Give it to him!" and Moses being now loose from his grasp was planking it into him in right good earnest. 
               "Enough!" cried Fitz. "That will do, I'm beat!" 
               Moses let him up, and after the usual treating of the company, which generally follows such scenes, the most brotherly feeling seemed to have been established between the vanquished and his victor. That night they occupied the same room, and Moses Doan and James Fitzpatrick, became plighted to each other in heart and purpose from that time forward. 
               A few circumstances in the history of this new acquisition to the band of the Doans, we consider would not be out of place here, or inconsistent with the somewhat restrictive title of this work. 
               Fitzpatrick was born and raised in Chester county, and by all accounts was of excellent parentage. When quite young he was apprenticed to the blacksmith trade, and was very remarkable for his skill in the various sports and pursuits of the young men of that day. 
               A short time after he came to the age of twenty-one years, he enlisted to serve his country in the Revolutionary war. But the strict regulations in the army, was so unsuited to his notions of liberty and freedom, that he soon deserted and went back to his home. A reward, however, was offered for his apprehension, and one day while he was at work in a meadow, in London Grove township, he was arrested by two soidiers, who had crept stealthily up to him, and secured him by surprise. They were about taking him with them to Wilmington, where he was to be tried, and severely punished; but he besought them to allow him to bid farewell to his mother, as otherwise, she would not know what had become of him. Acceding to his request they accompanied him to the house, when as soon as he had entered, he loosened the cords from his hands, and taking down the trusty rifle, returned to the door, took deliberate aim at the terrified soldiers, and declared he would shoot them dead if they did not leave immediately. Seeing he was determined, they left with all possible speed, and Fitz coolly returned again into the house, laid down his gun, and went out to finish his work. This circumstance embittered him greatly against the cause of the colonies, and in revenge he determined from that time to use his whole energies in behalf of Great Britain. 
               Many are the incidents related of him, between this time and the time of his encounter with Moses Doan. It appears that shortly after the above occurrence, he became a complete highwayman, committing depredations when and wherever he found and opportunity. But he would never harm the poor. On one occasion a poor woman was proceeding to town with what little money she had to procure a stock of goods. He met her, and in the conversation that ensued, she informed him that she was fearful of meeting Capt. Fitz, who was somewhere in the neighborhood. Fitz immediately drew from his pocket a purse of guineas, and presenting it to the wondering woman, told her he was Fitz, and immediately turned, and disappeared in the woods. 
               He was wont to waylay the Whig collectors of public monies, and one of them whom he robbed he also took to his cave and kept him there for two weeks; the impression being, meanwhile, that he was murdered. 
               Fifty persons, all well armed, at one time started out in search of him, determined to take him, if possible, dead or alive. They pursued him for some hours, when becoming fatigued, they stopped in a tavern to rest. Their conversation while there, was entirely concerning Fitz, and his exploits, and a very general wish was expressed that they could meet with him; when he, being all the time in the same room, sprang to his feet, rifle in hand, declaring he was the person they sought, but daring any man of them to move. He kept his rifle presented while he drank a small glass of rum at the bar, and then withdrawing, kept his rifle pointed towards the tavern door till out of range, when he took to his heels, leaving the party in utter amazement. One or two shots were fired after him, but to no effect. 
               At another time a party of twenty men hunted him with guns and rifles. Suddenly stepping from behind a tree, he accosted one of the party who was standing near him and some distance from the rest, with the question "who are you looking for?" The man answered "Fitz."-"Come with me," said he, "and I will show you where to find him." The unsuspecting man followed him to a considerable distance into the woods, when Fitz, turning round, said, "I am Fitz, just lay down your arms, if you please." The man obeyed, when he took him, stripped him, tied him to a tree, and flogged him severely. He then loosed him and let him go, telling him to inform his companions that he had seen Fitz, and where. But it is needless to say that when they came to the spot he was not there. 
               A price had been set upon him, alive or dead, but he continued to walk in open day, armed with pistols and dagger, not caring whom he met; and once he passed from a hill near Kennett Square, to Taylor's Tavern, through a crowd of people who made way for him; where he took a drink and went away again without being molested, though many were there, armed for the express purpose of taking him. 
               Such was the man whom Moses Doan had now taken with him to share his destiny. 
               Shortly after the night of their first acquaintance, an arrangement was entered into between them to the effect, that whenever the band visited Chester county, Fitz should assume command, but in Bucks county he would be content to follow Moses. As soon as this thing was fully settled between them, the whole party mounted their horses, and just as the sun had gone down, set out on an excursion into Chester county, in search of adventure. 
               It was agreed upon along the route that Fitz should first conduct the company to his cave, as the affair they intended to take first in hand, was of such a character, that it required only himself and Moses to work at it. Arriving at the cave, and things being fixed, the two chiefs set out on business only as yet known to Fitz. 
               Riding back the way they came, for the distance of a couple of miles, they recrossed the Brandy wine, and came in front of a large farm house, when Fitz, suddenly stopping, directed Moses' attention to what he thought was the figure of a man on horseback going at a rapid rate before them. 
               "I know that chicken," said Fitz, "that's that infernal spy Henderson." 
               "An infernal coward, I should say," replied Moses, "for a gill of whiskey I'd put after him." 
               "We've got better business on hand, Moses," returned Fitz, "but I'm certain there's trouble brewing to night, or he wouldn't be about. What we do, we must do quickly." 
               Dismounting, they both tied their horses to the barnyard gate, and proceeded at once to the stable, from whence they led out two as handsome colts as ever were shod. 
               "Now we've got the horse flesh, we've got to have the tin," said Fitz. "What say you Mose?" 
               "As thee likes it," said Moses, "just as thee says-I'm in." 
               Accordingly the four horses were soon led over to the fence around the house; but Moses intimating to Fitz, that they would be safer in the woods, proposed to lead them back among the trees and out of sight. This was agreed to, and done, and both then returned to the house and thundered at the door with their huge fists. Quickly the window flew up, and a head in a night cap appeared, asking in a rather gruff voice- 
               "Who's there." 
               "We are two poor travelers," said Moses, "honest men; my companion is not able to proceed any farther, and we would thank you to allow us to remain under your roof till morning." 
               "It's a bitter cold night," said the farmer, talking to some person inside, "suppose we let 'em in. They wouldn't ask for shelter if they weren't honest, as they say they are." 
               A moment or two elapsed, while the person inside was speaking, and then the farmer made answer- 
               "If they are honest, we ought to give 'em shelter, and if they ain't, they'll make mischief if we don't; so I guess I'll let 'em in." "Wait till I can come down, men, and I'll let you in." 
               The old man soon came down stairs and unbarred the door. Fitz and Moses walked in, and the old farmer handed them each a seat, and enquired about the war. 
               "Well, the red-coats are getting pretty well drubbed, I can tell you;" said Moses, "according to last accounts, a handful of our brave men whipped over a thousand of them." 
               "That's good news," joyfully exclaimed the old farmer, "Let us have a little good old whiskey on the strength on't. It'll do you good this cold night." 
               The old man took the light and descended to the cellar. 
               "I told you the old fellow was a cussed old rebel," said Fitz, in a whisper, "and now we must put the climax on right away, or Henderson will be here." 
                
               "All right," returned Moses, "leave that to me." 
               "Let's drink to the health of-" 
               Here the old man made his appearance, and thus stopped the sentence, but Moses understood what was coming, and winked his assent. 
               The whiskey was set upon the table, with three glasses, and the old farmer poured it out and commenced to hand it round. 
               "Thee art the oldest," said Moses, "now for a toast." 
               "Health and prosperity to the sons of liberty-death and hell to the red-coats," said the old man, and he quaffed the potion with great gusto. 
               "Here's long life to King George, and death and hell to the cursed rebels," said Moses, holding up his glass and looking the wonder-stricken farmer full in the face. 
               "Here's a health to the man that quietly forks over the tin;" says Fitz, as he held out his hand to receive it. 
               "Robbers! Robbers!" cried the old man at the top of his voice. 
               "Hold on," said Moses, clapping his hand over his mouth, "give us your money, or you're a dead man." 
               "I have none." 
               "I'll find it," said Fitz, as he sprung up the stairs. 
               "Be quick-Henderson! Bar the door!" 
               There was a loud shouting and tramping of horses outside, and Fitz sprung to the door and barred it. The farmer's wife by this time had found out what was the matter, and added her screams to the general confusion and tumult. 
               "Fitz is there! Fitz is there!" cried those who were crowding around the door. 
               "Open the door! you bloody robbers you!" shouted a voice, which Moses took for Henderson's. 
               "It won't be good for the foremost of ye, if we do," shouted Moses purposely, so that they might hear. 
               "We'll risk it," replied another voice, with evident rage. 
               The door was well nigh broken in, and the outlaws looked around for some place of escape. There was a back window in the kitchen where they were, and Fitz on examining it, communicated to Moses in a sly manner, that that must be their means of egress. Hastily they snatched a clothes line that was hanging near, and with it tied the old man to the bar in such a manner, that by his struggles to get loose he would unbar the door; and then putting out the light, they made a hasty retreat out of the window. Just as Moses, who was the last one out, alighted upon the ground, he heard the door bang open and the report of a rifle simultaneously, and then almost immediately, a heavy fall upon the floor. Their plan had succeeded, and the old man had been shot instead of them. 
               It was a dark night, and as they came round towards the front, though they could see nothing, they could hear the voices receding, as Henderson's party went into the house shouting- 
               "Hurrah! Fitz is shot! Good for Henderson! Hurrah!" 
               Cries of "get a light!" were heard faintly as they reached their horses; and the next and last sounds from the house which greeted their ears as they rode away, were the agonizing cries of the wife, over the blood-steeped corpse of her husband. 
               Henderson had shot him dead, and until a light was brought, was confident he had shot Fitz. 
               But the two robbers made all possible speed to the cave, which having once entered, they feared neither man nor devil. The horses which composed their booty, were kept safely there for about a week, when they were taken to Philadelphia by night under escort of the whole party. 
               Moses and Fitz returned to the cave shortly afterwards, but found that it had been searched, and very wisely determined to fix upon some other place of rendezvous. In the course of the day they came across an old log cabin, in Towamencin township, inhabited by an old woman. From the position of the spot, they concluded it would be very suitable for their purpose if they could but secure it, and with this object in view, they both dimounted and knocked at the door. A very poor old woman soon appeared on the threshold, who asked them in. It was not long before they made known to her the object of their visit, and by an agreement to remunerate her well for the privilege, won her over to their plans. Immediately they returned to the city, and that same night the whole band was brought out to their new quarters. The old lady, however, was as yet very much afraid, and as she heard the tramping of the horses hoofs at midnight, coming up from the valley below, and reflected on the murderous character of those who were soon to be her guests, her heart began to fail her, until she was aroused by the shouts of the men at the door to a sense of her utter helplessness and inability to go back from her agreement. But as their visits became more frequent, so she became more reconciled to their company, and her lonely home in the woods, was ever afterwards, as long as it stood, the den of Moses Doan and his band, in Chester county. 
             
             
               CHAPTER X. 
               The Spy. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "Oh, for a tongue to curse the slave, 
                           Whose treason, like a deadly blight, 
                           Comes o'er the councils of the brave. 
                           And blasts them in their hour of might." 
                        
                      
                     MOORE. 
                   
                
               "Nine o'clock," said Moses to his brother Levi and his cousin Abraham, as they were going along the road somewhere near Chadd's Ford, "nine o'clock; I heard it strike in that last house as we came by. Boys, be on the look out, we must do something to-night; funds are getting low." 
               "Never fear," said Abraham "we'll meet some cussed old rebel that's got plenty, before we reach town yet." 
               "Well if we don't," said Levi, "I go in for doing a night's work in town." 
               "Let it be so," said Moses, "but don't attack any but rebels if you know it. I don't want to offend the British, just now." 
               With the above expressed object in view, they journeyed onward till they came to where the Star Tavern now stands; then, about a mile from the city. Here they overtook a physician, returning from a visit to a patient who lived some distance out of town. They passed him several yards, when Abraham whispered to Moses- 
               "He's got the rhino, suppose we try him." 
               "Just as thee pleases," answered Moses, "but I think he's a Britisher. There is a Doctor somewhere in the city, that's real good metal. I think they call him Kearsley." 
               "Suppose I ask him his name." 
               "Ask him for his money, first;" said Moses, "and then thee'll know him, without asking his name." 
               With that Abraham wheeled around, dismounted, and caught at the doctor's horse. 
               "Money! you old rebel!" he cried, "or I'll blow your brains out." 
               "I'm no rebel, sir;" quietly replied the doctor. "My name is Kearsley, if you want to arrest me, you've got to fight for it: and if you only want my money, you've got to fight for that too;" continued he, drawing out a pistol from a concealed belt. 
               "True grit!" exclaimed Abraham, turning round and calling to Moses. "A regular good fellow." 
               "I've not the pleasure of your acquaintance, sir; pray may I ask, who are you?" said the Doctor. 
               "We are the Doans," said Moses, with emphasis. 
               "Hale fellows well met," replied the Doctor, "I've long been wanting to see you, and as I'm now in a hurry and have special business on hand for Gen. Howe, I hope you will defer your business with me at least till after day-break." 
               "Certainly sir." 
               "At about day-break then, meet me at the south east corner of Seventh and Chesnut streets, and we will talk over matters. Good night, sirs." 
               And the Doctor rode off toward the city at full speed, while the three outlaws went leisurely along admiring his courage, and polite behavior, and speculating as to the kind of business he could have with Gen. Howe. 
               The morning found Moses, Levi, Abraham and Kearsley, engaged in close conversation in a room at the place above designated; the result of which was that Moses and Levi received letters of introduction from him to Gen. Howe, recommending them, as men eminently qualified to serve the army in the capacity of spies. 
               Moses and Levi therefore, the next morning started for New York, while Abraham not being inclined to go, joined the rest of the band, under Fitzpatrick, who still continued their depredations in Bucks and Chester counties. 
               The crimson tinted morning was just ushering in upon the world, the blood-red God of day, as Moses and Levi Doan beheld the city of New York, and urged their horses by caresses and spurs towards the spot where waved the red-crossed flag of Old England. 
               About an hour afterwards a boat was upon the waters, and well-skilled oarsmen rowed swiftly across the sunlit waves for Staten Island. In the stern of that boat, with eyes fixed upon the barracks, stood two men of rather uncouth appearance, yet of matchless former and of strong and muscular frames, with long, flowing and glossy hair falling back over their shoulders, and rifles in hand. With the lightness of doors they sprang upon the land, and made directly for head quarters. The pompous red-coat sentinels strutted backward and forward ward before the gate, and cast disdainful side-looks at the two individuals whom they saw approaching. 
               But the latter heeded no one, and made rapid strides towards the gate. 
               "Who comes there!" cried the sentinel. 
               "Moses Doan," shouted Moses, "I have business with Gen. Howe." 
               "What have you to show, sir?" 
               "Do thee take me for a mountebank!" 
               "I mean, have you any papers!" 
               "Here's something," said Moses, showing the letters he had received from Kearsley. The sentinel looked at the superscription and said "Pass on, sirs." 
               After waiting a considerable time in a kind of ante-chamber, an officer entered and informed them that it was the wish of Gen. Howe that they should accompany him into his presence, and that it was customary on such hazardous occasions, to subject to a strict search, all strangers who sought an interview with the Commander-in-Chief. Perhaps this search, on account of the suspicious appearance of the two men, was conducted a little more closely than usual, however it is certain, that no weapon the size of a pin would have been likely to have escaped the officers scrutiny. 
               This ceremony gone through with, Moses and Levi were then ushered into the presence of the General, who was sitting at a small round centre table, busily engaged with his staff, in tracing their proposed routine of attack, on certain maps and charts before them. 
               We will not pretend to give the substance of the conversation which occurred between them, when Gen. Howe took them back into the ante-chamber, and was there alone with them for more than an hour. The result of that conversation is all that is known concerning it; which was, that they should follow and spy out the movements of the rebels, and keep up constant communication with him, with regard to their observations. 
               From that time began Moses Doan's career as a spy, and for sometime thereafter he done nothing but sleep in the day, spy around in the evening, and convey the intelligence he had gathered, to Howe in the night. 
               About five days after his first arrival in New-York, his cousin Abraham becoming dissatisfied with the leadership of Fitzpatrick, also made his appearance in that city, and joined with Moses and Levi, in the game of spy. Shortly after this, two other men, of desperate and despicable characters, were added to their number named Solomon and Isaac Vickers, and in addition to the additional pay which this accession brought to the whole company, as spies for the British, they were now strong enough to make considerable hauls, in the way of plunder, by burglary, and other means. 
               After a long deliberation and consultation, they made up their minds to select some spot in Jersey, where they could erect a cabin, something similar to thai of the old woman's in Chester county. To carry this idea into practice, they selected a spot near the Passaic river, within about three miles of Newark, which was so situated, that whatever suspicions might be excited in the neighborhood with regard to them, they could take refuge there, without much danger of being discovered. Besides this, they were within sound of the bugles of both armies, and whenever, by mingling with the American soldiery, and pretending to be friends of their cause, they could gather any information which would be of interest to General Howe-they could soon communicate it, as they were within a comparatively short ride of the barracks. 
               One evening in a tavern in Newark, Levi Doan was "plying the pumps" to the many half inebriated drinkers who where there lounging around. In the course of his soundings, he came upon a poor fellow, who was a little more than "half on the way," and a little soft besides, and to whom he soon began to pay particular attention. 
               "Landlord," said Levi, "let us have some more of that good whiskey; I want to drink a toast with Farmer-what did thee say thy name was?" 
               "I own as good a (hic) farm, as any man in (hic) these parts, and my name is (hic) Shelton." 
               "Farmer Shelton; yes-well, now for a toast Farmer Shelton." 
               "(Hic) Here goes-(hic) Hell and damnation to the British." 
               "So say I," vociferated Levi, loud enough to be heard by every one in the room;" and now for my toast. "Here's a health to old Putnam, and death and destruction to all the cussed tories." 
               "Well done, boy," said Farmer Shelton.-"That's (hic) good. They say there's agents out here to (hic) rob our people, but my money's all right." 
               "I'd like to know where to put mine for safety," said Levi. 
                
               "Sew it up in a feather (hic) bed, same as I have," said the farmer. 
               "Pretty good plan," returned Levi, "safe enough there. But I must go now," added Levi, "I see it's nearly nine o'clock." 
               "Well, good night, my fine fellow," said farmer Shelton, heartily, and shaking hands, "we'll take a (hic) drink together again before long, (hic) I hope." 
               "I hope so;" replied Levi and instantly left the house. 
               Levi immediately hastened away to the hut in the woods, and informed his comrades of the when and where, to deprive the good old farmer of his shining treasure in the feather bed. 
               It was not long before a party of five, under the leadership of Levi, were quickly proceeding in the direction of Shelton's residence. It was sometime after midnight when they arrived before the mansion, and with noiseless steps, they glided around the house, to discover the best means of gaining entrance. At length one of them, by climbing up on the piazza, found a window which could be opened, and the whole party were soon inside of the house. With a bold, unfaltering, but quiet step, Levi advanced to the door of the room from whence proceeded the sounds of the heavy breathing of the old farmer in his drunken snooze. A loud scream greeted them as soon as they entered the room, from Shelton's wife, which was quickly stifled by the monstrous hand of Abraham. 
               "Holloa there!" cried Farmer Shelton, with some degree of terror, "Where's my gun, Margery?" 
               "Here it is," said Isaac Vickars, pointing his rifle at his head, "another word before you're spoken to, and it will blow your brains out." 
               "Be a little easy, old fellow," said Abe, "we don't want thy life, as that would be of no use to us, but thee has something in that feather bed beneath thee." 
               "Not a penny?" groaned Shelton. 
               "Then thee liest;" exclaimed Levi, "don't thee know me?" 
               "Turn over here, old bloat," said Isaac Vickars, "we'll soon see." 
               The ticking was soon ripped open, and the feathers examined, but nothing was found. They then tied the farmer and his wife to the bed, and proceeded to another room, where they also ripped open the ticking of the bed, and after considerable time spent, in searching among the feathers, at last came across it, sewed up in one corner. They went back to the room and spent some minutes in torturing him by various means, by singeing his hair with the candle light, tickling his feet, and such like. After they had carried out their full fun, they loosened him and his partner, and dividing the money before his eyes, bid him good bye and departed. 
               In such adventures as these they continued to pass their time, whenever opportunity occurred, and often came into the possession of fine spirited young horses by the same means, which they sold to the British officers at enormous prices. 
               But Moses Doan during all this time was faithfully serving General Howe, daily carrying to him valuable information concerning the position, condition and intentions of the American army. 
               On the night his comrades were at the Shelton mansion, and at about the same hour, he was introduced to the Commander-in-chief for the second time since the setting of the sun; and he brought very valuable and important news. 
               "Putnam is thine," said Moses, "use a little caution, and let thy men be brave. I know of a pass which they have left unguarded, and through which you may pass to the very ranks of the enemy without being noticed." 
               "Are you sure that it is not a snare to entrap us?" asked the General. 
               "I'm sure they know nothing about it," said Moses, sharply, rather piqued that any objection should be raised to his plan. 
               Howe stepped aside for a few moments and consulted some officers who were standing near him, after which, turning again to Doan, he said: 
               "I hope, sir, you will be pleased to stay with us till we make the attack, as your knowledge of the route will be of great service." 
               Moses nodded his assent, and then left the apartment. 
               The next evening the army marched to carry out his plan, and in the morning, having guided them through the pass, and fearful that Howe might fail of success, and lay the blame to him, he gave the word of command himself; when the men dashed on, charging with the bayonet upon the surprised and terror stricken soldiers, till after a courageous and almost miraculous resistance, they were obliged to give way before over-powering numbers. 
               Thus on the 27th of August, of that year, the British obtained a victory, but a cowardly one, only through the instrumentality, and nerve of the cow boy of Plumstead, Moses Doan. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XI. 
               The Traitor Frustrated. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           --"Slaves who would sell 
                           Their native land to tyranny and shame." 
                        
                      
                     BARTON. 
                   
                
               The doings of the outlaw crew in New Jersey, had become so grievously annoying to the inhabitants, that companies were formed for the express purpose of hunting them down, and entirely annihilating them. Their chances for plunder consequently becoming limited, they concluded to return to Bucks county; and here we find them again, engaged in their usual practices. 
               One evening they rode up to a tavern on the river road to Point Pleasant, which, we believe is still standing; and commenced a regular carousal, after the style of their usual pastime in the woods, astonishing those who were present by their daring and boldness, as they were then being sought after, and rewards had been offered for their arrest. A colored man among the crowd, however, in answering one of their remarks as they entered the bar-room, caused some offence to Abraham Doan, who, immediately uplifting his huge fist, struck him a blow immediately above the right ear, with such force, as to so completely stun him, that bystanders for some minutes thought him dead. 
               At about midnight they left the house, taking a course in the direction of Doylestown. Somewhere in the neighborhood of Cross Keys tavern, on the Easton road, they met sometime before morning, two men on horseback, wearing masks and evidently out on similar business with themselves. At any rate, that was the impression at first created; but reason was soon given them for thinking otherwise. As soon as they recognized the Doan party, they put spurs to their horses, and fled. The whole gang then set off in pursuit, shouting and swearing, and riding like mad men. It was not long before the two men were overtaken; and Moses and Abraham being the two first to come up with them, each seized his man and unhorsed him. 
               "Cursed rebels, eh?" asked Moses. "Guess you want the Doans." 
               "Here we are," said Abraham, in a mocking tone; "and there you are," he added as both were slung into a ditch with their arms pinioned. 
               "Not so fast, fellows," cried one of the men, "we are friends." 
               "We aint rebels, any how," shouted the other, as they were about to take their horses away, and leave him and his companion where they were. 
               "What made you run then?" enquired Vickars. 
               "We thought you wouldn't like opposition," said they. 
               "Will you join us?" asked Moses. 
               "Willingly!" they replied, "and think ourselves honored." 
               "There's your horses then," said Levi, "Vickars, loose them." 
               "Ah! ah!" exclaimed Moses, as the masks were drawn from their faces, "not so easy, gentlemen; I have had some slight knowledge of you before. Let me look at that rifle." 
               The rifle was handed to him, and after examining it for a few moments, he continued in an enquiring tone- 
               "An Indian once owned that?-and that too," he added, pointing to the rifle of the other. 
               Both men turned deadly pale, and a perceptible trembling immediately came upon them. 
               "What's up?" asked Levi. "Who are they?" 
               "That one's name would be Shenoah," answered Moses, "but he wants courage; and that one's name would be Massaola, but, he steals the poor Indian's rifles." 
               "I understand," said Levi. 
               "Now, gentlemen," said Moses, addressing the men, "when Shenoah was pinioned you was ready to kill him; directly he was loosened you ran away. Cowards like you are not fit to live, but you shall have one chance for your life.-Now, as you are used to running, when I say run, then go for your lives, and if you get out of gunshot, before I load and shoot, you are safe; but if not, you are dead men." 
               Moses then gave orders to search them for valuables, which being done, he asked- 
               "Are you ready?" 
               "Yes," was the reply. 
               "Run!" shouted Moses, and his quick arm worked to do the work of retribution on one, while Abraham loaded the second gun which was to bring down the other. 
               "Bang!" went the gun, and over went the one farthest ahead. 
               "Bang!" again, and over goes the other. 
               Taking the horses, the gang turned about, and went into the woods near by, to consult as to what they had better do in order to dispose of them. Moses volunteered, after some discussion, to attend to that business, and immediately left for that purpose. 
               The rest stayed in the woods all that day, and passed the time in riotous mirth. At night they selected the township of Bedminster, for the purpose pose of adventure, and at about midnight entered the house of the collector of taxes, for that township, expecting to make a fine haul of the clear coin. The collector, Mr. Robert Darrah, however, was a man of great nerve, and their attempt here was entirely unsuccessful. They gained entrance noiselessly and proceeded at once to the room, where the family lay sleeping, arousing them by their vociferous demands for money; to which Mr. Darrah replied, that he had none. But they were not to be put off in that manner, and after a great deal of coaxing, which proved unavailing to draw any answer from him, they resorted to threats, and soon began to put them into execution. They tied his hands together in such a manner, that they might form a kind of bowl, when Abraham Doan ran down stairs and fetched up a shovel full of live coals, and emptied them into his hands, while he was compelled to hold them in that position, by reason of the strong cords which bound them. Although he suffered great agony, he still refused to tell where his money was, or even to acknowledge that he had any; until, finally, they left the house, very likely, supposing that he told the truth. His hands remained, each one a mass of running sores, to the end of his life; notwithstanding every known means was employed to effect their cure. 
               The next day Moses returned with the money he had made by the sale of the horses, and a jolly carousal was again kept up till night. In the evening, the whole band were gathered around the spring of Holi Kong, in Buckingham township; just when Sol's last ray had gone down beneath the western horizon. The spring here mentioned is celebrated for its mysterious depth, and a certain tradition concerning it, that an Indian once fell in, and subsequently came out at Ingham's spring, three miles distant. It is funnel shaped, and about fifty feet in circumference at the top, gradually decreasing to about the diameter of a yard, at which point is the surface of the water. 
               Here they met with an old solitaire of the woods, called John Merton, whose proper name no one ever knew, but who was supposed to belong to some wealthy, aristocratic family, of England. His peculiar mode of life had made him an object of suspicion among his neighbors, and the inhabitants of the whole valley, showed their dislike for him, in a greater or lesser degree respectively. By this means they had incurred his most bitter hatred, and he having found out by some means that the Doans were in the neighborhood, applied to them for aid to redress his grievances. They promised him the revenge he wished for, if he would join their band, to which he consented after some little hesitation, and afterwards became a very valuable aid to them on account of his thorough knowledge of that neighborhood. 
               Moses Doan had now an appointment with the British to fulfil, and while he was gone upon that business, his band paid a visit to Chester county, and joined the others under Fitzpatrick. Their depredations there, were but the same old stories of outrage, robbery and sometimes murder. 
               However we find them together again in Bucks county, a few months later, where during the winter of '76-7 they carried on their operations chiefly in the British army. The Delaware now flowed between the two belligerent forces; Gen. Howe, occupying the State of New Jersey, and General Washington, having his head quarters on this side the river, at Newtown, in a house which is still standing, situated just outside of the Borough, being about thirty yards west of Newtown creek. 
               Doan now had an opportunity of harrassing the patriot troops to his heart's content in his own county, and was always enabled by the aid of Merton to elude the strict search which was constantly being made for him and his party in consequence; while he also had full communication with the British by just merely crossing the Delaware. 
               Their place of rendezvous, during their watching and annoying of the American army at this period, was under, what has been called the "Pulpit Rock," near the "Dripping Spring," about a mile west of Newtown. When holding communications with the British lines, they generally met at a place called Dark Hollow, near the river. Merton, however, introduced them to several places of security which they frequented as the occasion required, and by this means, as well as by means of his tact and cunning, not only saved them from their enemies, but often led, and delivered the latter into their hands. 
               We are sorry that but one complete instance of his service to the band in this way remains upon record, and this one we give, being fully assured of its authenticity. 
               One night, after that the Doans had been doing considerable mischief in the camp, it came to their knowledge that three soldiers were lying in wait in a certain place, to shoot them down, as soon as they came within gunshot.-Merton instantly proposed a plan to frustrate their purpose, and speedily put it into execution. Disguising himself as a very old man, tottering and feeble, he began, when within about fifteen or twenty yards of the spot where he knew the soldiers were lying, to moan piteously, and to act the part of one in great pain. The sight as he passed them excited their pity, and they rose up and went to him asking what was the matter. 
               "Oh," said he "those rascally Doans-my wife, my poor children-what will they do!" 
               "What have they done?" 
               "They have beaten me with clubs, till I was almost dead." 
               "Where are they now?" anxiously demanded the soldiers. 
               "They are at my cottage yonder," replied Merton. 
               "Bring us to them, quick," said they, "we will teach them how to ill-treat an aged man like you." 
               "I can scarcely walk," groaned out Merton, as he limped and hobbled along as if in the accutest pain all over him. 
               "Oh, cheer up old man," said one of them taking a flask from his pocket, "here take a drop of this, it will do you good." 
               Merton was now in for a good swig of good brandy, and done full justice to the opportunity. 
               "I'll feel better now," said he, as he handed the flask to the owner; "I'll try to take you to them if you will promise to shoot them down;-I don't hardly think I could do it myself." 
               "Oh, you never mind; we'll attend to that," said they. 
               Merton led them a little farther, till they came to a very densely grown part of the woods, and then stopping, bade them observe a light, a short distance ahead. 
               "There's were they are," whispered he "cautiously, quietly," he added in a low tone, but with earnestness. "Here, I'll lead the way," said he again, and they immediately halted until he went forward. He had no sooner done so, than the Doans sprang from behind the trees and disarmed them, and the wounded old man threw off his disguise, and appeared in his real character, that of a robust and able young outlaw. 
               "Holloa, my hearties!" he exclaimed, "I thought you were coming with me to shoot the Doans, where are you?" continued he, groping about. 
               "We've whipped the British at last," tauntingly, remarked Levi. "No they ain't either, they are rebels; ain't they Merton?" 
               "No," said Aaron, "they are British, and you are going to hear them hurrah for King George presently." 
               "If that's the case," said Abraham, "we'll send them over the river. What does thee say, Mose?" 
               "As you're all agreed," said Moses. 
               At this they raised them up, and ran them down to the river, where they pushed them under the water, and then pulled them out again, telling them they must hurrah for King George before they go. 
               This they refused to do at first; but at length after another ducking, they shouted- 
               "Hurrah for King George!" 
               After this they let them go; and when the soldiers returned to their comrades and told the story of their adventure, there was no small amount of sport made out of the affair. They were ever afterwards known, as long as they lived, as the Ducked Rangers of Dark Hollow. 
               Thus they continued to annoy the army, and to contrive to escape from those who sought to punish them, until that memorable, cold Christmas night, when Washington took up his march from Newtown to Taylorsville, near which place he crossed the Delaware, landing on the other side, at what is now called Titusville. 
               That night the camp of the Doan's was all alive. Ever watchful for aught of intelligence which would be of service to the British, the unusual stir in the American lines was quickly communicated to the whole party, and while some were dispatched to follow the army to gather information, others were stationed at one or two points between Taylorsville and Morrisville, while Moses and Abraham hastened to convey the intelligence already received to the officer in command of the forces stationed at Trenton. 
               Not finding him at his headquarters, Moses left the message, which he had scribbled off on a piece of paper in the hands of Abraham, with instructions to deliver it in person; while he hastened to gather what other information could possibly be obtained. 
               After very diligent search, occupying nearly two hours, the commanding officer, Col. Rahl, was found, at a "card party" in a house which stood on the spot now known as the north-east corner of Green and Hanover streets; and being very closely interested in the game, thrust the note, given him by Abraham into his vest pocket, and evidently thought no more about it. The consequence sequence of this neglect cannot be better described, than it is in the following extract from a published history of our country. 
               Washington having taken the enemy by surprise early on the morning of the 26th of December, the attack was begun with infantry, under the command of General Knox. The infantry was supported by the artillery with spirit and firmness, and it was now the tears and prayers of the sons and daughters of liberty found acceptance in the sight of Heaven. The enemy was thrown into confusion in every quarter. One regiment attempted to form in an orchard, but were soon forced to fall back upon their main body. A company of them took refuge in a stone house, which they defended with a field piece, judiciously posted in the entry. Col. Washington was ordered to dislodge them. He advanced with a field piece, but finding his men exposed to a close and heavy fire, he suddenly leaped from them, and rushing into the house seized the officer by the collar, who had command of the gun, and claimed him as his prisoner. His men followed him, and the whole company, were immediately made prisoners of war. The Captain received a ball in his hand on entering the house. In the meantime victory declared itself everywhere in favor of the American army, and Gen. Washington received the submission of the main body of the enemy by means of a flag.-The joy of the American troops can be more easily conceived than described. This was the first important advantage they had gained over the enemy, in the course of the campaign, and its consequences were at once foreseen upon the affairs of America. The loss of the enemy amounted to, nearly one hundred killed and wounded; among the former was their commander, above one thousand prisoners were taken, together with six field pieces, and a considerable quantity of camp furniture of all kinds,-Private baggage was immediately rendered sacred by a general order. About one hundred of the enemy escaped by the lower road to Bordentown. The Americans had several privates and only one officer wounded. After having refreshed themselves and rested a few hours in Trenton, they returned with their prisoners, and other trophies of victory, to the Pennsylvania side of the river, by the same way they came, with the loss of only three men, who perished with the cold in recrossing the river-an event not to be wondered at, when we consider that many of them were half-naked, and most of them bare-foot." 
               The note of warning written by Moses Doan was found on Rahl's person, as he laid among the dead. It was written with a lead pencil; the following is a correct copy of it- 
                     "Washington is coming on you down the river-he will be here afore long.
                  
                  DOAN."
                
               Col. Rahl expired in a house opposite what is now called Perry street. 
               Thus was the conspiracy of the wicked against the cause of the just, made of none effect and brought to nought; and the half-naked and half-perished children of liberty, by the helpful ordering of God, covered themselves with glory, and inspired the patriots of the land by their example and success, to renew their strength and to hope for that blessed consummation which has long since been perfected. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XII. 
               A Robbery and Difficulty. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "Even the outlaw hath sometimes been known 
                           To have respect for woman in her weakness." 
                        
                      
                     ANON. 
                   
                
               While the British were in possession of Trenton, the eyes of the Doans, at one time became directed towards the home of a good old Quaker farmer, by the name of Thomas Middleton, who resided near Princeton; and by falsely representing to Col. Rahl, that said person was a very noisy and active rebel, leave was obtained from that officer to treat him and his property as they pleased. 
               Fitzpatrick's party, and Moses Doan's party were now acting together, and combined, made quite a formidable force. They started from Trenton about dark, and soon arrived at a tavern which was situated within about four hundred yards of their destination. Here they were enticed to stop a moment, to listen to a song which was being sung in the bar room, the burthen of which was "Death to the Tories." As soon as the song was finished they all marched in, Fitzpatrick keeping guard at the door with a brace of loaded pistols, while Abraham seized the young man, named Howell, who sung the song, and tortured him by pinching, &c., till he sung it again. After suffering a great deal, he finally complied, after which they let him go; and when they had drank their usual toast of "health to King George and death to the rebels," they departed. 
               It took them but a few moments to reach Middleton's residence. Abraham knocked at the door, and demanded admission for the party, in the King's name, as his officers. Admission once gained, the real object of their visit was soon made apparent, and after a few preliminary questions and answers, they demanded money, which demand Middleton determined not to satisfy, and he replied that he hadn't any.-At this they commenced to search the house and found their way into the bedrooms. Mrs. Middleton, who was rather an elderly woman, was pushed down stairs, and the servant girl was taken by the hair of her head and dropped over the stair-ballisters. Not finding any money, they then, out of revenge, commenced to beat Middleton about the face with the butts of their whips; when just as Moses had inflicted upon him a blow of stunning effect, Mahlon Doan, who had been stationed as sentinel outside, gave the alarm; and a large body of men was near the house. 
               This was the party that was in the tavern, headed by George Justice and Caleb Redner, the members of that party had gone to their homes for their rifles and had now arrived in pursuit of the outlaws as they retreated from the house; and although a volley was fired upon the latter by the whole company, not one of them was hurt and all made good their escape. 
               At another time Abraham Doan, who had recently been to the city to dispose of some jewelry which had been stolen from a widow lady near Doylestown, was returning, and when about ten miles on the road, overtook a market wagon going along, and in a good natured manner began to converse with the tipsy farmer who was driving At length they came to a tavern where Abraham managed to get the man helplessly intoxicated, when, tumbling him into the wagon, he hitched his own horse behind and took the lines himself. The drunken farmer began to amuse himself by singing snatches of songs, which were anything else than complimentary to Abraham and his companions, until finally, unable to hold himself up any longer, he sank back in the wagon in a deep and snoring sleep. Doan then turned off into the woods, and after rifling the pockets of his victim, unhitched his own horse and rode off with his booty, leaving the farmer comfortably snoozing in the woods. 
               In the morning about sunrise he awoke, and after considerable conjecturing as to where he was, concluded that he was about three miles from Bristol, to which place he made all possible speed, after he got out of the woods. 
               After the battle of Brandywine, the British occupied Philadelphia, affording excellent opportunities to the outlaws to carry out their schemes of robbery and plunder in that city without fear of punishment. But in the month of February following we find them again in Bucks County, where companies had now been formed for the express purpose of their capture, and where they very narrowly escaped several times. It was about this time that an incident occurred which illustrated Moses Doan's better qualities, and takes much from the truthful character of statements intended to show that he was the worst one of the gang. A poor woman by the name of Copely, with a family of small children, had been left by the heartless tyranny of the soldiers, almost without food for herself and little ones, and although she had repeatedly applied to the officers for a pass, and it was frequently promised, still they neglected to furnish it. A mother will even face muskets and the cannon's mouth to answer the cravings of her darling offspring for bread; and so resolved Mrs. Copeley, when she set off without a pass to the mills to procure food for her children. By taking a circuitous course she contrived to escape the sentinels, and on arriving at the mills, the miller filled her flour-bag gratuitously, and she started back with it towards her home. She passed several sentinels on her way back by the same means, but just as she was about entering he city, a man of rather rough appearance suddenly stepped from the side of the road and stood before her. She had heard of the Doans, and truthfully settled in her mind that this was one of them. It was Moses Doan. He looked upon her compassionately and enquired in a kind tone of voice concerning her circumstances. The woman, half-trembling, related her story, how that her children, through the strict surveillance of the soldiery, were almost starving for want of food, and how she had so daringly ventured in the face of that surveillance to obtain a supply for them. She also informed him that her husband was away with the troops under Washington, and that she was poor and unprotected in consequence. The heart of Moses Doan was touched, and presenting her with a well-filled purse, he directed her how to escape the guards, and then departed. 
               The poor woman toiled on with her load, until she reached Vine street, where a sentinel pounced upon her, and seizing her bag of flour demanded her pass. She began to repeat her pitiful story, but the brutal soldier would not listen to it, and claiming the flour as forfeited, informed her that she should thank him that she was not sent to the guard-house. Just then a tall man, who had been standing at a little distance off, and in whom the poor woman was glad to recognize her kind benefactor of a few minutes before, came up, and in a meek and coaxing manner solicited that he would give the woman her flour and let her pass. The soldier refused, and words began to get rather high between them, when Doan, suddenly seizing him by the throat with one hand, and seizing the bag of flour with the other, threw the latter to the woman and bade her run with it; while deliberately drawing a pistol from his bosom, he shot the sentinel dead, scattering his brains in all directions all over the ground. 
               Instantly the guard-house was all excitement, and numbers of soldiers were hastening to the spot. But Doan had fled. His horse was tied in the woods near by, while interceding for the woman, and now horse and rider were swiftly going in the direction of a certain point on the Delaware, where a boat lay hid, which Moses intended to make use of to gain the other side of the river. But in this he was foiled. The British pursued him in great numbers; and as he was going at the top of his horse's speed, a body of soldiers suddenly sprang out upon him and surrounded him. These knew not who he was, nor what he had done, but merely seized him, because they knew he was an American, and his great speed excited suspicion. One man caught the bridle, and held on to it, while the rest began to dispute as to who he was. Some seemed to know him as Doan, others contradicted; but he, watching his opportunity, suddenly aimed a blow at the man who held his horse, bringing the butt end of his musket so violently in contact with his head, as to knock him to the distance of several yards. Quick as lightning Doan was off again, and was not again molested until he had reached the river, where, before he had time to attempt to make use of his boat, he found the British were close upon him. Boldly his noble horse struck out into the stream, soon followed by the pursuing soldiers in his boat. Shot and ball flew around him like hail, until at length he reached the Jersey shore in safety. Turning himself quickly in his saddle, he drew a second pistol from his pocket, and took deliberate aim at one of his pursuers, as they were now rapidly approaching the shore. 
               "Down, Captain, or the scoundrel's ball will reach you!" hurriedly exclaimed one of the party who had been intently watching the movements of Doan. 
               The caution came too late. The manly figure who stood up in the bow of the foremost boat, fell over a lifeless corpse, into the river. The soldiers were wonder-stricken, but they were destined to witness more than this. Drawing from a sheath a long, straight sword, he sent it whirling through the air, aimed at the front oarsman, in whose body it would have assuredly taken effect, had he not seen it, and calculated its direction just in time to save himself. He, fortunately for him, jumped to one side, and had the satisfaction of seeing the weapon stick and quiver in the boards of the vessel, on the exact spot where he was sitting, instead of feeling its death-wound through the centre of his heart.-This action was answered by a volley of leaden balls from the whole company, but Moses Doan was out of all reach, and safely betook himself to the woods, which when he had once gained, the pursuit was abandoned. 
               Some of the soldiers on returning to their comrades declared that it was no mortal man they had been dealing with, but Satan himself; for they had seen his cloven foot in the stirrup, and had also seen something like a serpent's head and neck, bending backward and forward, just above the horse's back. 
               Great excitement prevailed in the British camp for several days on account of the affair, and the Doans kept themselves away from the British entirely, for nearly a month, and only returned, on the earnest solicitations of General Howe. 
               It was during his ride to the city in answer to these solicitations, that Moses Doan, came across the following circumstance. As he turned around a corner of the road, he observed the officer who had been sent after him, pursuing a beautiful girl, a short distance in advance of him. He had heretofore considered him as the very soul of honor-who, instead of thus attacking a defenceless woman, would, as he believed, have been the very first man to have risked his life in behalf of the innocent and unprotected. The woman ran with all her speed, but still the brutal red-coat gained upon her. Moses might have urged his horse, and prevented his catching her, but he preferred to await a more proper moment for interference. Finally the officer caught her, and loudly the poor girl screamed for help. 
               Just as all hope of help reaching her had began to forsake her, she heard the speedy clattering of horses' hoofs, and looking up observed to her great joy a large and powerful man who was not a red-coat, coming at full speed. 
                
               As Moses came up to the officer, the latter shouted to him- 
               "Go on, Doan, I'll be with you directly." 
               "What's up?" sternly demanded Doan. 
               "Oh, never you mind," replied the officer, with a knowing wink. 
               "Base villain," cried Doan, "thee call thyself a gentleman! Let the girl go." 
               "Don't get in a passion, you can-" 
               "Let the girl go, I say!" vociferated Doan. 
               "I'm no fool;" rejoined the officer. 
               "I never speak three times, without being heeded," said Doan, and drawing a pistol from under his coat, he shot the British officer dead upon the spot. "And now," said he to the girl, "go where thee will; but be sure to keep out of the way of such rascals, if thee can." 
               He then rode on, and told General Howe what he had done, who done all he could to conceal the fact from his officers and men; and not withstanding the conclusive evidence against him with regard to the former affair, he was now fully restored again, to the confidence and friendship of the British. 
               Moses Doan's better traits of character were in these two incidents very strongly exhibited. He was always ready to help the suffering and the helpless, and never approved of those cowardly and brutal acts, which his brothers and other members of the band delighted in. He was born with the qualities of a good man, and were it not that his home education was neglected until it was too late, he might have filled a much better place, with honor to himself and to the glory of his country.

                     CRABBE. 
                   
                
               One cold night in the month of December, the whole party were congregated in a tavern in Water street, deliberating as to whom they should attack and plunder, as their means had become considerably decreased, and money must be had. 
               There was a family named Smith, living on the Schuylkill, very near to where Manayunk now stands. Four of this family were stout young men, who had on some former occasion, greatly offended and enraged the Doans, and the result of their deliberations above mentioned, involved an attack upon their dwelling. 
               The next afternoon, a little before sunset, Moses Doan rode out of Philadelphia, to the mill owned by the father of the Smith family. Dismounting, he entered, and enquired if the mill was for sale. The old man and his younger son was in the mill, at the time, and to the interrogatory of Moses, the former answered that he had no wish to sell. At this Moses offered him six hundred pounds for the property, but the old man still refused to sell. Doan then merely remarked, that he would have to look farther, strode out of the mill, mounted his horse and rode off. 
               After supper that evening, old Thomas Smith, while sitting in his cozy arm-chair, before the cheerful fire, was reflecting upon the incident which had occurred during the day, and his suspicions became aroused as he revolved the matter in his mind, until he concluded that some evil intent and not any real purpose, induced the stranger to ask about the selling of the mill. 
               With this thought in his mind the old man dispatched his son to the tavern, to enquire if such a person had been there, in order if possible to gain some information as to who it was, and what was his real business. The boy soon returned with information sufficient to convince him that it was one of the Doans, and as he knew of the quarrel which had taken place between the band and his sons, he thought it advisable to prepare that night for an attack.-His four elder sons, however were not at home, but were with Washington in the army; but four good men in their places were soon found, who, with the old man and his youngest son, were quickly ready, well-armed, and waiting the arrival of the outlaw band. 
               It was now after nine o'clock, the night was dark, and the snow flakes were falling thick and fast; whirled by the wind into many a drift and ridge. Until midnight a light was kept burning, but after that time it was extinguished; the opinion of the watchers being that even if the outlaws had intended to make an attack, the fury of the storm had compelled them to aban don the adventure, and they therefore laid down upon the floor and went to sleep with their trusty guns beside them. Not so, however, acted the master of the house, who wisely judged that they would prefer a storm to carry out their design, and he remained sitting in his chair immediately opposite the door. Scarce had the old family clock chimed the hour of two, ere his quick ear detected the sound of voices without, and he at once awakened his slumbering friends. He had scarcely done this when the word of command was given outside, and instantly the door gave way to the force of a large billet of wood, aimed with all the force of the whole party combined. 
               "Fire!" shouted old Smith, and immediately the simultaneous report of the whole four rifles was followed by a groan of agony. The Refugees surprised and disconcerted, mounted their horses, which were hitched close by, and rode off down the road as rapidly as possible. One of their number, however, was left behind. He was found lying on the lower step, mortally wounded. They brought him in and laid him on the settee, but his wound bled in spite of all efforts to the countrary, until death at length claimed him as his own. His name was Jacob Harwood, and had but recently joined the Doans. An inquest was held upon the body next day, and a verdict rendered in accordance with the facts. Harwood was buried in a woods near the road side, and for many years the inhabitants for miles around affirmed that it was haunted; as they fancied they heard strange noises and saw his ghost stalking among the trees. 
               Although the outlaws were foiled in this attempt, they were not much discouraged, and several robberies were committed about this time. 
               In the month of February following, a daring robbery was committed in the residence of Isaiah Hallowell, in New Market street, between Vine and Callowhill, in the city of Philadelphia. Mahlon and Abraham Doan were the parties engaged in it, Abraham done the work and Mahlon merely acted as an accomplice. 
               One afternoon, a miserable looking object was seen by Isaiah's wife, seated upon the steps. She raised the window and accosted him. The man looked up with an imploring gaze of abject wretchedness, that at once appealed to the sympathy of the benevolent and kind hearted woman. She enquired if he was not suffering from cold, and if he was not hungry. 
               "Yes, ma'am," he replied, "I've not tasted a mouthful since yesterday at dinner time, and I've walked all the way here from Bristol, since then. My feet are now sore, I can't walk without pain." And he put forward his feet, which were well bound up in old and soiled strips of muslin. 
               "Poor man," said the good woman-"and such cold weather as it is too!" Turning around to her niece she continued, "Harriet go open the door, and conduct the poor man back into the kitchen, where he can warm himself." 
               "God bless thee ma'am," said the pretended beggar in a fervent tone, as if he felt deeply grateful for the humanity of the good Quaker lady. 
               The door was opened and he hobbled back into the kitchen where victuals were soon placed before him, and he ate ravenously. 
               Soon the old gentleman came in, and becoming interested in the affecting story told concerning him, by his wife and niece, he went back into the kitchen to observe for himself the recipient of his bounty. After a short conversation, the benevolent gentleman expressed himself as exceedingly pleased with him, and the family sat and conversed with the stranger till the hour for supper, when he partook of that meal with them, and after prayers, was invited to remain all night. He expressed his thanks earnestly, and Harriet was immediately sent to prepare his bed. 
               It was about nine o'clock, when the good Isaiah took a candle to light the beggar to his room. When there, the worthy old man stood beside him, helped him undress, and even lifted him into bed. Having effected this kind act and seeing the poor man well covered up under a load of blankets, quilts, and bed-clothing, he took up the light, bade him "good night," and then went down stairs. Soon after this they all retired for the night. 
               The beggar was not in the least sleepy, and soon heard Isaiah snoring in the room below him. He lay thus for about a half an hour, when he slipped out of bed, drew on his clothes, and groped his way in the dark, very quietly down stairs. He moved along the entry with a stealthy tread, and softly unfastened the front door. He then uttered a low whistle, and a man emerged from an opposite alley, and came directly across the street. 
               "Are they all sound asleep yet?" was the question of the new comer. 
               "Yes, keep quiet." 
               "Are you sure all is right, Abe?" 
               "To be sure I am; never fear me, come in." 
               Both in the entry and the door locked, our beggar asked the other if he had a tinder box and matches along with him. The box and matches were at once produced from his pocket, a light was struck, then a candle lighted and shut up in a dark lantern, with all of which necessaries his confederate in crime had come prepared. They then tried the parlor door, which was locked, and Abraham Doan, (for it was he who had shammed himself off on the Quaker) took from his cousin Mahlon Doan, a skeleton key, and succeeded directly in shooting back the bolt of the lock. Having got into the parlor, they picked the lock of one of those old fashioned mahogany secretaries, that we yet see occasionally among the furniture of old families, and in one of its secret drawers they discovered, and immediately appropriated to their own use, about four hundred pounds, part of it being gold coin and the balance comprised in notes of the bank of England. They next possessed themselves of all the silver they could find, consisting of two dozen table and tea spoons, snuffers and tray, and a massive pair of candlesticks. 
               Mahlon, Abraham's cousin and confederate, now wanted to be off, but Abraham, signified his intention of first obtaining the old gentleman's watch. Mahlon, accordingly took care of the booty already obtained and waited outside for his cousin to appear with the watch, while he made his way to the good old Quaker's bed-room, to carry out his purpose. He very quietly raised the latch and entered the room without disturbing the slumbers of either of them. Hallowell, who was a sound sleeper was snoring away quite lustily. Abraham got to the head of the bed, and began to search under the pillow for the watch he so much coveted. The Quaker was partly awakened by it. 
               "Eh, what does thee want, Harriet-is it breakfast time?" he said, as if speaking to his niece, who was in the habit of calling him in the morning; and then turned over on his side. 
               The reckless plunderer dodged down, and remained breathlessly silent. After a little while the snoring was resumed, and he again stealthily slipped his hand under the pillow. Again was the sleeping Hallowell disturbed. He sat upright in bed. His sudden movements awakened his wife also, and she asked him, "what was the matter." 
               "I declare, Rachel, I thought I felt a hand beneath my pillow, reaching for my gold watch. But I find it is safe, it must have been a dream." 
               "Oh, 'twas but a dream," she replied, "lie down again, and go to sleep. We have strange imaginings sometimes in our dreams." 
               The old man laid down again, and the worthy couple were soon again enjoying soundest slumbers. Presently the thief reached very slyly and cautiously for the third time under the pillow, and obtaining hold of the watch, withdrew it as slyly and cautiously, and crept stealthily with it out of the room. Arriving at the foot of the stairs, he opened the front door and found his companion awaiting him on the other side of the street. Abraham communicated to his cousin the fact of his success, and both taking to their horses, which were not far distant, they mounted, and ere morning dawned, were some twenty miles from the city with their valuable treasure. 
               On the following morning Isaiah Hallowell, found out that he had entertained a robber, as well as a beggar in one and the same person, and information was immediately given to the police to that effect. Handbills were struck off and posted everywhere, offering rewards for the apprehension of the daring robber, but all to no purpose. 
               Their haunt at this time was not known, until it was at last discovered in the following manner, by a young man named James Reed, who was at that time, a hired laborer on a farm in the neighborhood of Bridge Valley. 
               Reed had been visiting his lady-love one Sunday evening, and had remained in her company until near twelve o'clock, when he made preparations to depart for home. The young lady, who, during the time he had been there was unusually cheerful, when he proposed leaving insisted upon his remaining until morning. Upon his refusal to comply with her request, she told him that she was afraid he would fall into the hands of the Doans. 
               "Oh, nonsense, Annie; girls like you are always fearing the worst. I'm not afraid, as to my ability to escape a whole regiment of Doans. My fast horse Rover, will bear me out of their reach in quick time." 
               "You will go then?" 
               "To be sure I will; I'm bound to go for the fun of it. Good bye! If I see the Doans, I'll whistle to you." 
               Reed went out, and reaching his horse, was soon coursing homewards. As he rode however, after a short time, he heard the sound of horse's hoofs in the distance, and at once the presentiment of Annie recurred to him. Riding on a few yards he turned into a thicket, and impatiently awaited their coming. He was not kept in suspense many minutes before the outlaws trotted by him. After they had passed, Reed determined to follow them to ascertain where they kept their quarters. They kept on the York Road until they reached Bushington, where they turned to the right and kept on by Carver's mill, and from thence to the place where they had harbored, which was in an old log house, in the forks of Neshaminy, in Warwick township. Reed had kept near them without being observed, until they had put their horses away in the shed, and were about entering the house, when he turned his horse homewards to give the alarm without delay. His horse happened just then to neigh, by which they discovered that they had been watched, and two of them saddled their horses, and started in pursuit; but after an exciting race of three miles finding it was impossible to gain upon him, they gave a parting salute by firing pistols after him, and gave up the chase.-Reed informed the neighbors, and a large party went after-them the next morning, but they had taken their departure, and although the country around was searched, they were unable to find them.

                           "O mischief thou art swift

                     ROMEO AND JULIET. 
                   
                
               The Doans were spending the night in revelry and mirth, in a chosen haunt near the outskirts of the city. It was near one o'clock, and the noisy brawlers were about dispersing, when they were startled by a loud rapping at the outer door. 
               "Who's there?" shouted Joseph. 
               "Joe Condit" 
               "Where are you from?" 
               "Over in the Jarseys." 
               "Anybody with you?" 
               "No." 
               "Let him in," said Moses. 
               The door was unbolted and the stranger walked in. His person was filthy to the last degree of uncleanliness, his features displayed a most depraved mind, mingled with a sinister, villanous expression that was extremely revolting. In his eyes cruelty, sensuality and cunning, peered out from every gleam, while his head was surmounted with a mass of tangled, dirty, sandy-hued locks, which formed the crowning glory of his mean and miserable appearance. 
               "What is your business, with us, sir?" demanded Moses, in an authoritative tone. 
               "Well," said Condit, "I have heard of you for some time, you hate the rebels, but you don't hate them a bit worse n'r I do, and I don't think it is a bit of harm to rob the rascals if you can. I know some of the rankest kind of that stripe, who have got lots of chink, that you have never come across yet; and I can just take you there, as slick as a hound will follow a hare, I want to join your band, and have revenge upon some of them, who have taken my wife away. I married a very pretty girl by the name of Mary Ann French, good enough in her way, but her folks make a fool of her. They have all got plenty of money, and if you want a share in it say so." 
               "We have other matters on hand just now," said the Captain; "but if trade gets dull, we'll help thee through with it." 
               "In the meantime I'll go with you," remarked Condit. 
               "That's if we please," said Moses rather tartly. 
               "Oh, Mose, let the poor fellow go along," said Fitzpatrick. 
               "Are you afraid of death, stranger?" asked Fitz. 
               "No, nor the devil either;" was his reply. 
               "True grit, anyhow;" remarked Levi. 
               "We've got one Joe, already," said Aaron, "and suppose, to distinguish them from each other, we call this fellow Foxy Joe?" 
               "Agreed." 
               Thus was initiated into their company the desperate Joe Condit, who on account of his low cunning became very valuable to the refugees as a pimp and a spy. 
               The next evening, according to arrangement, they set out, Foxy Joe among their number, on an expedition to rob a farmer named Lucas, who lived somewhere on the borders of Chester county, and Delaware State. 
               Arrived near the premises, Moses sent on his spies, one by one, who in the same manner returned and reported the result of their observations on the premises. After the information was all given in, Moses having them altogether, thus gave his orders- 
               "My orders are for all to go quietly to the front door, and batter it in. Then go up stairs and tie the whole party of rebels. If any one hollers, gag them at once. Fitzpatrick and myself, will look out for the plunder, while the rest of you watch the prisoners. Remember, not a word until we have them all secured." 
               The gang started at a signal from the Captain, and in a short time were in front of the house. It was the work of a moment to batter in the door and ascend the steps, to the apartment where the inmates slept. The noise however, awakened Lucas, and as two of them entered his room, he sprang from his bed, took hold of his pistol, the sharp click of the lock sounding very ominously in the ears of the burglars. 
               "Villains, what want you here?" he demanded; and at the same instant discharged the weapon at the foremost one of the gang. Scarce had the sound of the report died away, when the right arm of Levi, shattered by the ball, fell powerless to his side; and the pistol which it held dropped harmless on the carpet. Seeing their companion wounded, the others with a fiendish yell, now rushed upon the defenceless Lucas-hurled him to the floor, and struck him such violant blows over the head with their pistols, that the blood spouted out from his wounds and ran in small puddles on the floor. This harsh and merciless beating would soon have destroyed his life, as he was already insensible, had not his noble hearted wife, forgetful of her own safety, thrown herself upon his prostrate body and shrieked for help to save him from being murdered. It was a soul-harrowing scene to gaze upon, that was transpiring in that bedchamber in the dead hour of night. Lucas moaning with the intense agony he was suffering, by being beaten and brutally trampled upon; his wife clinging to him and sobbing as if her heart would break; while as inhuman a band of drunken assassins as was ever known, stood and looked on, while some of them were roughly grasping her to sunder her from him, whom she thus evidenced was dearer to her than life itself; the wounded Levi uttering most blasphemous oaths, and encouraging his comrades to kill the now helpless man who had maimed him; while, with his eyes filled with tears, their little boy, unconscious of the reason of such conduct, had left the bed and was calling loudly for his mother. His very innocence should have saved him, but Foxy Joe, annoyed by his crying, took hold of him by the hair, and pitched him back into bed. 
               After considerable time had been spent by them in searching the house for money, and in the above ill-treatment of its inmates, they all went down stairs to see what good things could be found in the cellar, except Foxy Joe, who was left to take charge of Lucas and his family. 
               Moses, however, was not very willing to trust him with so important a post, and hearing a noise, crept stealthily up the stairs to ascertain the cause of it. He found that what he had suspected was indeed true,-Mrs. Lucas had swooned away, and the part that Foxy Joe had in bringing about that circumstance, so exasperated Moses, that he at once seized him by the throat, and with gigantic strength, hurled him out of the room and over the banisters. 
               "There let him lie," said Moses to the men, as they came into the entry to see what was the matter, "the mean contemptible varmint, to abuse a helpless woman." 
               The men said nothing, but the next moment their captain was partaking with them of the good cheer of the house, and in about another quarter of an hour, the whole band, including Foxy Joe, left the house, very well satisfied with their success, yet somewhat displeased on account of Levi's wound. 
               The excitement of that night so much affected the nervous temperament of Lucas, that it threw him into a raging fever, which made him delirious, and for several days his life was despaired of. The wound made in the arm of Levi, by the bullet, shot from Lucas' pistol, was a mark which years afterwards served to establish his identity when arrested not far from the same place. 
               Sometime after this they determined to make another attempt upon the residence of the Smith's. While on their way out of Philadelphia for that purpose, they happened to stop at a tavern, where the younger brother of the five, was just taking a drink, after which he walked very calmly to the door and left the house. As soon as he was gone Moses asked the landlord the particulars of the young man's family in a roundabout manner, so as not to excite suspicion that he wanted information for any particular purpose. He was soon satisfied as to the young gentleman's being the younger Smith, and when they were all outside, a council was held, to consider the propriety of relinquishing their intended attack for that night. A vote was taken when it was found that a majority were in favor of making the attack immediately; and as the decision was binding, they remounted their horses, and rode on towards the farm house. 
               Young Smith had recognized the Doans, and when he went out, as soon as he had reached the shed where his horse was hitched, he sprang into the saddle and rode leisurely towards the city to avoid susplcion until he came to a cow-path, into which he turned and went at full speed across the country to his home. When he reached there, he at once communicated the unwelcome tidings of the Doans' approaching; and they quickly armed themselves and prepared to meet them. 
               By the father's persuasion, the mother and two daughters were prevailed upon to leave the place of danger to avoid probable loss of life or at least, insult and outrage, which would certainly be their portion should the expected intruders be successful; and under the protection of two of the sons they went off to a neighboring farm for refuge. After they had left, a candle was lighted and placed on the table by a front window so as to cast its rays without the room. The courageous old man with his five valiant sons, (the two having returned,) each armed with a rifle, and provided with long knives, left the building and concealed themselves behind a worm fence about twenty yards off, where the tangled briars prevented them from being seen. Here they remained in a state of intense anxiety, for nearly an hour, when they heard the sounds of horses' hoofs coming nearer and nearer, and giving undoubted signal of the approach of the Refugees. In a few moments the whole band of desperate outlaws were in sight, riding up to within a few yards of the place where the Smiths had secreted themselves, being near enough for them to hear distinctly all that was said by their assailants. Moses Doan, who, as was his custom, rode at the head of his men, in a low tone of voice said, 
               "Halt, boys; and dismount! That light burning looks as if the rebels were on their guard." 
               Scarcely had the words left his lips, when a startling report of fire-arms from behind the fence was heard, and the Captain wounded by the discharge, fell heavily to the ground. So sudden and unexpected was the repulse, that the Doans, trembling with fear, thought only of self-preservation and all ran for their horses except Fitz and Abe, who enraged and maddened sallied out in the direction whence came the report. The Smiths after firing the first volley, retreated down to a small creek for safety, and where they could watch the movements of their disconcerted enemies without their being able to find them out. After waiting a short time to hear if there would be a repetition of the shooting, the alarmed deperadoes returned to where Moses was still lying, in the same spot where he had first fallen. They found him severely wounded in the right shoulder, from which blood was flowing profusely, and the victim of his own folly suffering from the pain which it caused.-They were anxious to remove him, and procuring a light wagon and harness from the shed, geared Moses' horse to, and placing him in the wagon, prepared to depart. An attempt, however, was first made to fire the building, but the straw they used for that purpose being wet with the recent rains, did not burn very rapidly, and as they immediately decamped, Smith's boy arrived in time to put the fire out, before it done any injury. It was several weeks before the wound of Moses became sufficiently healed to allow him to resume his place as leader of the gang. The Smiths had thus foiled them a second time, and it became quite a saying in those days that "the Smiths were too much for the Doans." 
               Shortly after this they left Philadelphia and came up the York Road, near to Jamison's tavern in Warwick township, where John Tucker, a tax collector resided. They found him at a little distance from home, and after tying him to a tree, and administering upon him a severe flagellation with hickory twigs, made him tell where he kept his money. They then loosed him and bade him lead them to the exact spot, when he took them into his garden, where they found about thirty pounds hidden under the pea bushes. They were not satisfied with this, and after considerable hesitation, being much threatened, he took them into the cellar and handed over thirty pounds more. They then left in good spirits, and galloped down the turnpike again towards the city.

                           Rush into blood, the sack of cities seek; 
                           Unpierced exulting in the widow's wail, 
                           The virgin's shriek, and infant's trembling cry." 
                        
                      
                     ANON. 
                   
                
               The Doans, in the reverses which the British army were encountering day after day, never suspended their expeditions for plunder and revenge; but with great hatred towards the patriot soldiers, they still hovered about their camp fires, ready to convey intelligence to the enemy. When not employed as spies they would meet together, and make a descent upon some lonely farm house, or unprotected village; carrying off with them whatever was valuable, and disposed of their ill-gotten gains to the British soldiery, who were loud in their commendations upon their shrewdness and cunning. 
               Among the most important duties confided to them and for which they were well recompensed, as the service was an arduous one, and beset with danger, was the rescuing of the prisoners of war, who were kept as hostages by the orders of Washington. The building in which these prisoners were confined was at Lancaster, and it was here that a most terrible encounter was had between Abraham Doan and Capt. Lee. 
                
               In spite of all precautions, prisoners disappeared in an unaccountable manner, and nothing was heard of them until they resumed their places in the British army. Gen. Hazen who had charge of the post, at length devised means to detect the manner of their escape, and selected Capt. Lee to carry out his plans. It was given out that Lee had left the post on furlough. He, however, having disguised himself as a British officer, was thrown into the prison with the others. 
               His first discovery implicated an old woman who came within the inclosure with fruit every day. But one dark and stormy night, brought the real circumstances for which he had now been some time waiting, and a tall figure was observed to glide noiselessly into the room where he was lying, about midnight, and approached one of the sleepers, waking him up, and the next he came to was himself. The figure touched him, and he started up, when a faint gleam from a dark lantern was thrown upon his countenance, and he heard a whisper "not the man-but come." 
               Lee followed, and they moved silently out of the room. The door of the house was already unbarred, and a part of the fence was removed on the outside through which they passed, until they came to the cottage of the old apple-woman, where a table was spread for them. The man who conducted them was Moses Doan. Lee journeyed with them night after night, toward the British quarters, and was very zealously guarded, that there was no chance of his escape. At times they were concealed for days in barns, cellars, caves, and similar retreats, made for the purpose; and one day was passed in a tomb, the dimensions of which had been enlargged, and the inmates, if there ever had been any, had vanished to make room for the living. 
               At length Abraham Doan from some cause or other, began to suspect that there was something wrong about Lee, and this suspicion leading him to a more minute examination of his countenance, soon grew into a certainty as to his identity as Captain Lee. Immediately on making this discovery, he communicated his knowledge to the rest of the party, after which he avowed his intention of murdering him on the spot, but was prevented by Moses. 
               After travelling about twelve days, they came to the Delaware river, but finding no boat with which to cross the stream. Moses left Lee in charge of Abraham, while he and the rest went to procure one. Before he went, however, he loaded Abraham's pistols with powder only, knowing well his desperate character and that he would use them on the least provocation.-He had not been gone long before Lee began to suspect that he was not in very safe hands, and summoning up his resolution, he made a sudden spring at his keeper, with the intention of wresting the pistol from him which he held in his hand, but the thoughtful, wary Doan, was upon his guard, and aimed the deadly weapon with such precision, that had the pistol been charged with bullet, that moment would have been his last. As it was the shock was so severe as to throw Lee to the ground, but fortunately the Refugee dropped the pistol, when Lee reaching it, struck him a heavy blow on the head as he was stooping for his knife, and felled him also to the ground. Lee now rose and throwing his whole weight on the prostrate villain, endeavored to choke him, while the hand of Doan clutched the fleshy part of his cheek, and his strong nails tore his face open, until part of it only hung to the jaw-bone, the wounds thus inflicted causing him the most torturing pain. Lee's strength was fast failing him, when fortunately a party of patriots came up, when Doan made good his escape. Captain Lee, as soon as he was satisfied that they were adherents to the American cause, told them who he was, but they were not inclined to believe him, and after taking him before a magistrate they lodged him in jail. Lee however, prevailed upon the jailor to take a letter from him to General Lincoln, informing him of his condition. The General on receiving it sent for him to the jail. He wished to improve his appearance a little before he presented himself before the Secretary of War; but the order was peremptory and he was brought as he was. When he returned to Lancaster, he retraced the ground over which he had been conducted by the Refugees, and in so doing, brought fifteen persons to justice for aiding in the escape, and for harboring British prisoners. 
               In the month of June, 1780, the Doans, being hunted down and encompassed, determined upon a plan to gain the services of Gen. Kniphausen in order to take revenge upon their pursuers. Accordingly Moses set out for New York, and accused the people of certain neighborhoods of doing many things to the detriment of the army and the British cause; and the General started from Staten Island, according to the information received, to punish the traitors. They passed through Elizabeth town, and came about sunset to a small village known as the Connecticut ticut settlement, where he burned the buildings of about a dozen farmers who were suspected of aiding the "traitors." Some of them not satisfied with these outrages, carried straw and other combustible material into the Presbyterian church, ignited the pile and burned it to the ground. While these scenes were being enacted, Mrs. Caldwell, the minister's wife, who was seated in the nursery with her children around her, was disturbed by a loud knocking at the door; but as she did not go to open it, Abraham Doan and his cousin Levi, who were the persons seeking entrance, jumped over the fence and ran to the window where they observed Mrs. Caldwell sitting. 
               "I'll make short work of her," said Abraham. 
               "Go ahead then," replied Levi. 
               "Bang!" went the gun, and the unoffending lady was shot through the heart. Nine little hearts were struck with despair at the cruel deed, and the shrieks and sobbings of the children, had the effect of stopping further operations, for the ruffians turned about and walked away without any attempt at robbery. 
               On the next day the whole gang made preparations for an attack upon the family of Van Trenck, Joe Condit's father-in-law. The family consisted of himself and three daughters, the oldest of which had been married to Foxy Joe, as the Refugees called him, but had been compelled to leave him on account of his ill-treatment of her. This excited his anger, and it was in revenge for this that the present attack was contemplated. 
               A little after dark that night, Levi and Abraham rode up to the residence of Van Trenck, which was a tavern, and asked for accommodations for the night; the rest waiting in a woods near by. After a long conversation, the two Refugees desired, and were shown to their rooms. The family had not retired many minutes before a loud knock at the door was heard and Van Trenck looking out of the window saw two men with rifles standing below. 
               "Holloa there!" he shouted; "What do you want?" 
               "We want you to get your gun and come down immediately. The Doans are about and have set fire to widow Sockwell's cottage, and are beating the old woman and her girls, for we heard them screaming." 
               "Who are you?" enquired Van Trenck. 
               "We are cousins of Owen Sharpe's, and we are on our way to join the American army. He told us to hurry." 
               "Wait a moment, and I'll be with you; I have four rifles ready loaded, and I'll bring them along;" said he, as he shut the window down. 
               As he came out of his room, he met his eldest daughter, Condit's wife, who endeavored to impress upon him the danger to which he would expose them by leaving the house. Failing however, she then informed him that she was certain that she saw Condit peeping in at the window just before they went to bed, and related a dream that she had, that he would break in and kill them. But it was of no use, Van Trenck determined to go, and went up stairs to arouse his lodgers to go with him. He raised the latch, and entered the apartment where they both lay snoring for a pretence, and as they did not answer his call, he went towards the bed and shook them. At this they sprang out of bed, rushed upon him, extinguished the candle, and threw him upon the floor where they held him securely. 
               "Let me up," bellowed Van Trenck; "you don't know me I guess, I'm the landlord." 
               "That's gammon-won't go down," replied one of his assailants. 
               The thought now flashed across his mind that he was in the hands of the Doans. They immediately gagged and pinioned him; and tied him to the bed post, after which they went quietly down stairs to let in the whole party. The three daughters of Van Trenck were then sitting in the dining room unconscious of anything that had occurred. As the door of the room opened, Mrs. Condit recognised in the first figure that entered, the hated form of her discarded husband. Foxy Joe immediately darted towards her, while the three uttered the wildest shrieks, and seizing her by her long dishevelled tresses, dragged her out of the room, and handed her to Abe for a purpose previously agreed upon. The other sisters were then led into the bar and compelled to dance amid the rough jokes and vulgar language of the lookers on, after which they commenced to break every article of glass they could find, compelling the two women to dance on the sharpest fragments with their bare feet, and when they thought they did not move fast enough, urged them by striking them over the face and neck with their riding whips. Bleeding and wounded as the girls were, they were then forced to prepare supper for them. Towards daylight they tied the clothing of the three sisters over their heads, dragged old Mr. Van Trenck down stairs: drove them all out from the public road, and afterwards set fire to the house and departed. For several days afterwards, however, they continued in the neighborhood committing acts of outrage and violence, too obscene and cruel for pen to describe. 
               An incident occurred in Philadelphia, while the British were quartered there, by which Joseph Doan became a Lord in spite of himself. A certain Lord Rawdon, had made himself very agreeable to several families, both Whig and Tory, and was often a guest of some of the first families in the city. He was at any rate an especial favorite of an old gentleman whom was shall call Thomas. It happened that one night Thomas was at the theatre, and so was Joseph Doan and Foxy Joe; but the latter two only arrived just as the follows were coming out, Joseph slipped his hand somewhere in the vicinity of Thomas pocket, who quickly turning around, took him to be Lord Rawdon in disguise and addressed him accordingly. 
               "I am happy to see your lordship;" said he extending his hand, "when did you arrive in Philadelphia?" 
               Doan was not going to lose the joke, particularly as he knew who the old gentleman thought he was addressing, and was aware of his near resemblance to Lord Rawdon. He therefore at once determined to avail himself of Thomas' error. Joseph carried the thing out well, representing Foxy Joe as Col. Agnew. The next day by special invitation, the supposed Lord Rawdon and his friend partook of a sumptuous dinner at the table of Thomas, who with his daughter, done their utmost to render the visit of his lordship and the Col. agreeable. In the afternoon they all took a drive, and returned in the evening to tea. 'Two of Thomas' brothers called in during the evening, the bottle was handed around for several hours, and the two brothers indulge quite freely. Finally they left for their homes, and shortly after, Doan and Foxy Joe were conducted to the best chamber, where they were to pass the remainder of the night. In the morning it was found that his lordship and Col. Agnew were among the missing, and so also a large amount of money with nearly five hundred dollars worth of plate. A few days after, Thomas received a letter, that was mailed at Newtown. Bucks county, asking him in a jeering manner, "how he liked the company of Lord Rawdon and Col. Agnew." The letter was anonymous but Thomas was nevertheless, convinced that the Lord Rawdon and the writer of the letter, was one and the same person, and that a Doan. 
               Our information now carries us to the 22d of October, 1781, when the Doans with Fitzpatrick and the two Vickars, rode to a woods by the "Dripping Spring," about a mile back of Newtown, where they formerly had their rendezvous. Here they left their horses, and at about ten o'clock at night, walked into Newtown, to the house then occupied by John Hart, County Treasurer. They came to the kitchen door and boldly walked in. The only persons in the house at the time were John Hart, Mary Hellings his housekeeper, and Robert Thomas, a neighbor. The housekeeper and neighbor were secured by some of the party, while Solomon Vickars presenting the muzzle of a horse pistol to the breast of the Treasurer, demanded to know the whereabouts of the treasure confided to his keeping. Hart hesitated at first, but seeing the determination of Vickars to shoot him dead unless he told, he informed him that some of it was up stairs under the bed, and the balance in the fire-proof, back of the prothonotary's office. They were not long in bringing down the box from under the bed, which contained the funds, and having pocketed its contents, now demanded the key of the office and of the safe. Hart gave them the key of the office and replied that the safe was not locked, when, having procured a lantern, they proceeded to the office, and robbed it of everything that could be found. They then made them all promise to keep the house and not to raise the alarm till one hour after; and Hart afterwards said that he heard them hanging around the outside of the house or sometime afterwards to know of they kept their word. About daybreak the alarm was given, and a large party started in pursuit, but it was of no avail. They traced them for the distance of about two miles on the road to Wrightstown, where a farmer told them that he heard the sound of horse feet about two o'clock, and going to the window he observed about a dozen men going at full speed along the road. This was the most extensive robbery ever committed by them, their booty on this occasion amounting to 1307 in money. What became of is not known, but it is supposed that they buried it somewhere in the township of Wrightstown. For some weeks after this affair, the Doans were not visible in Bucks county, having in consequence of the excitement raised, changed their place of operations to the lower end of Burlington county, New Jersey, from whence however they were soon driven by the many regularly organized companies who pursued them. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVI. 
               Caught at Last. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "Crime follows crime apparently secure,

                     AKER. 
                   
                
               The Doans being hunted down every where within a considerable distance of their home, took a trip south, and after spending some time in Virginia, and North Carolina, returned to Bucks county, in the Autumn of 1781. Lord Cornwallis having surrendered at Yorktown, by which act the Revolutionary war came to a close; they were now deprived of their British protections, and had to rely entirely upon themselves, in the prosecution of their rubbing and murdering pursuits. During the winter of 1781-82, it is estimated that they stole at least two hundred horses. Of course it cannot be expected that we go into the details of the stealing of so vast a number; but there are two cases which, for reasons which will hereafter appear, it may be well to mention. The first was the larceny of a young bay horse, the property of John Shaw, valued at 200; and the other was the stealing of a pet black horse belonging to Joseph Grier. 
               A new and special company was now organized for their capture, under Col. William Hart, who induced some twelve others to join him.-However, at a meeting held at the Dublin tavern, Col. Robinson was chosen leader, and Patrick Mechlin, was appointed a spy, whose duty it was to follow the Doans, and to give notice of any attack by them. He was provided with a very fast grey mare, and often rode directly by the Doans, giving notice at every house he passed by shouting-"The Doans are coming! The Doans are coming!" 
               Upon one occasion he followed them until near daybreak, and by his continual shouting prevented them from doing any mischief. He also found out their place of refuge, and the next evening, after dark. Col. Hart, and his company started to find the villains, guided by Mechlin. They rode quietly along to the woods at the school house this side of Fisherville, where they halted by the road side awaiting their coming. Mechlin was too much excited to be prudent, and just as they discerned them approaching from the thicket, he called out at the top of his voice-"Come on boys!" 
               The Doans at once wheeled around, and started up the Easton road, with Hart and his party in full pursuit, but the latter were finally compelled to give up the chase. 
               Col. George Piper, of Bedminster, was about this time appointed Deputy United States Marshal, with authority to arrest the Doans, either dead or alive, and to affix a price on their heads to be given to any one who should take them. He accordingly provided himself with the power of the county, and among the number whom he selected to aid him, was an old vendue crier, Phillip Hinkle. On one occasion while searching for the Doans, Col. Piper found a lot of horses they had stolen from persons in Chester county. They were in the stable of a barn at Old Wyker's, in Tinicum, near the brick church. Some years afterwards it was ascertained that the Doans were secreted under the floor of an old weaving shop, adjoining Wyker's house. At another time they were discovered on their father's premises, shooting at a mark, in the Orchard. Col, Hart, Mechlin, and five of the neighbors advanced to take them, but they discovered their pursuers, and were out of sight in a minute. It has since been ascertained, that they took refuge in the barn, where was a false floor, containing a space large enough for a half a dozen men to lie in quite comfortably. 
               One night Moses Doan and his gang, broke into the hut of a man living in New Jersey, and carried off his wife, who was a young and very handsome woman. Moses lived with her about two months, at the place of rendezvous of the gang at that time, at Gaddis' Run, but at the end of the two months she escaped, and went back to her husband. 
               The party now began to exhibit signs of disunion, and while the great body of them went South, Fitzpatrick and a few others continued their depredations and burglaries in Chester county. He was at last arrested by men who were concealed in the house of a woman with whom he lodged, and whom he kept as a mistress; she having betrayed him, and allowed the men to conceal themselves for the purpose of taking him. When he came in they pounced upon, and after a desperate struggle, succeeded in tying him. He was then taken to the jail in Chester, where he was tried, condemned, and executed. 
               In February, 1783, Moses and his party returned again to Bucks county, and continued their old practices of burglary, robbery and outrage. The Federal Government had decreed them outlaws, and had offered a reward of $800 to any one who should capture them alive, or shoot them dead. 
               We before mentioned that John Shaw, of Plumstead, was one of those from whom the gang stole a horse, when this species of robbery seemed to be their special game. The Doans had in some way come to the knowledge that Shaw suspected them, and that he had uttered some very vindictive language concerning them. They therefore, determined on paying him a visit, and accordingly, about ten o'clock at night, they were at his residence. Shaw had some suspicion of their intended attack, and had prepared to defend himself and family. They walked up to the front door, and demanded admission, which he firmly denied them, and at the same time placed the barrel of a loaded rifle in an opening, which had been left for that purpose. This move the cunning Doans observed, and one of them said- 
               "We want to come in peaceably, to satisfy thee that we did not steal thy horse." 
               "Promise me," said Shaw, "and I will open the door." 
               "We wont hurt thee;" replied one of the gang. 
               Shaw then opened the door, being anxious to keep them in good humor, and in they walked. They failed to convince him that they did not steal his horse, and finding all they could say to that purpose, was of no use, they determined to steal every horse he owned. Moses and Levi then left the house, and went to the stable, leaving the rest to watch Shaw and his family. They had not been gone long, when Joseph Doan, said to Shaw: 
               "Are we still charged with stealing the horse?" 
               Shaw made no answer, and Abraham Doan, who was on the opposite side of the room, now walked to where he was sitting, and demanded a reply. Shaw said nothing. Abraham then struck him a violent blow upon the head, with his pistol, felling him to the floor, while the rest beat him about the face with the butts of their riding whips, until his face was severely cut in several places. Moses returned from the stable just then, and seeing the state of affairs began to reprimand them for their cruelty; and raising him up, he placed him on a bed, and proceeded to wash the blood from his wounds, and assisted Shaw's wife in attending to his injuries. The whole party then left the house, taking with them what plunder they could conveniently lay their hands on, and driving before them four horses, which however, they left in the woods, at about a mile distant, where they were found the next day. 
               Immediately after leaving the house of Shaw, they started for the residence of Joseph Grier, on whom they had resolved revenge for publishing them in the Philadelphia papers, as horse thieves. It was near one o'clock, when Grier, who was somewhat unwell for a few days previous, rose from his bed, went down stairs, and lighting a candle, concluded to wait up until daybreak. Going to the door, which he opened to see how the weather looked, he heard the quick and ringing sound of horses hoofs in the distance, and listening awhile, ascertained that they were approaching his dwelling. He instantly thought of the Doans, and assured himself that he would soon be attacked. Acting upon this, he left the house and hid himself behind a tree near by. Scarcely had be done so when he heard the Doans quite near, and soon saw them entering the house. He now became anxious for the safety of his wife and family, but comforted himself by reflecting that they had never been known to injure women nor children, when alone and unprotected. Abraham took the candle from the table, and they commenced to search the house for Grier, but not finding him, they entered a second time the chamber where his wife was still sleeping, and asked her where her husband was. This awakened her and one glance convinced her as to who were the questioners. A vision of blood and murder instantly came over, and she swooned away without giving any answer. They then left the apartment, taking with them a few articles of trifling value. As they were leaving the premises, Grier heard one of them say, 
               "It's a confounded lucky thing for Joe Grier that he was not at at home; but we'll have him yet." 
               Mr. Grier thought it was an exceedingly lucky thing, too, and with a thankful heart to a watchful Providence, he returned to his house, and found his family safe and sound. 
               After this, they went to Colonel Robinson's Lavern in the village of Dublin, and arriving there at about three o'clock in the morning, they called the Colonel up, by telling him they were in search of some horse thieves, and wanted something to drink. Not suspecting anything wrong, he came down stairs and unbarred the door, when he was immediately seized by two of the outlaws, who endeavored to throw him, Tearing himself away from them however, he was about to grasp his pistols, when a third one of them struck him a heavy blow, which brought him to the floor. Two of them then held him down, while others held his hands to prevent him from doing any harm. After long and manly struggling on his part, they managed finally to pinion him so as to render him helpless. Two of the gang then went up stairs, and by threats endeavored to get the Colonel's wife to tell where the money was. But she would not tell after all their threats, and they, becoming enraged at her stubbornness, dragged her out of bed and pulled her down stairs by her hair, throwing her on the bench with her husband, and threatening to shoot her dead if she attempted to stir. They then took a large, thick-plate looking glass and laying it on the floor, when they had stripped Robinson naked, bade him dance upon it, while they struck him over the body and face with their riding whips. A man by the name of Thompson, happening just then to pass that way, peeped in at the window, and seeing what was going on, immediately started off to alarm Mechlin, who lived about a half a mile from there, on the Welsh road. Mechlin immediately got up, saddled his grey mare and made for the Tavern, shouting as he went along. "Look out for the Doans." The Doans heard him shouting, and supposing he was at the head of a large force, immediately fled. Joseph Doan, however, was left behind, he having gone down in the cellar to hunt up provisions. Mechlin had now dismounted, and was in the bar-room attending to the wounds of Robinson, when Joseph, suspecting something was wrong, came up out of the cellar, and peeping into the bar-room, saw Mechlin, when he jumped out of a back window and ran for his horse. Mechlin heard the noise and ran out, and seeing the outlaw mount and start off, immediately mounted also, and started in pursuit. The chase was an exciting one for some time, and Doan underrating the animal which his pursuer rode, suddenly turned his horse, making him jump a worm fence, as though he dared Mechlin to follow him. But the latter was still after him. They went on in this way, keeping at about the same distance from each other all the time, until they came to the ascent of Prospect Hill, when just as Doan was in the act of laughing defiance at his pursuer, Mechlin fired. Doan uttered a cry of agony, but his horse still kept on, followed by Mechlin, to ascertain the effect of his shot.-When he had proceeded about a hundred yards, he dismounted and picked up four of the outlaw's teeth, which had been shot from his mouth. Mechlin returned to Dublin, and exhibited the teeth in the tavern, where they were kept for some time afterwards as a curiosity. Doan continued to ride on until he came to the Bethlehem road, down which he turned to the distance of about five miles below Montogomery Square, when he fainted from loss of blood and fell off his horse. He was subsequently found in an insensible condition by some farmers, and was taken to a house near by. The owner of the house recognized him as one of the Doans, and before sunset that evening he was taken to Philadelphia and lodged in Walnut street jail. 
               The next we hear of them is at the long house in Wrightstown, from which they were compelled to flee from the avenger. They rode up through Buckingham township, and stopped to rest at a farm in that neighborhood. Here Moses took the saddle bags containing a large amount of money, from his horse, carried it away to some distance, and buried it with a common hoe, which he found at the barn. As he was gone but a short time, and as his death occurred shortly afterwards, it is reasonable to suppose that it either remains there yet, or has been found by some person who never thought proper to say anything about it. 
               After this they kept themselves secluded in their cave on the Tohickon, on the Plumstead side of the creek, which was then occupied by a confederate of theirs named Halsey. The building has since gone to decay. They ordered Halsey's wife to give them bread: to which she replied that there was no meal in the house. They then told her that if she would send out and get flour, they would pay her well for it. She directed her son, a lad of about twelve years of age to go down to Wismer's old mill, about half a mile distant and procure the meal. The boy started, and when he arrived there, very innocently informed the miller that the Doans were at their house, and that his mother was in a hurry for the flour to make bread for them.-The miller at once secured the boy, to prevent his running home to give the alarm, and started off immediately over the fields to the tavern, where a training was going on that day, to raise a party to capture them. 
               Col. Hart, as soon as he was informed, appealed to the crowd to accompany him in taking them. But eight out of the whole crowd volunteered. The whole party that started on the hazardous undertaking consisted of nine persons sons only, including one Major Kennedy and Col. Hart himself. They rode on in silence until they came near the house, when they dismounted and held a consultation as to who should go first. All were unwilling, until Col. Hart volunteered to go first himself; and boldly starting but in front of the rest he approached the door alone, and opened it, exclaiming: 
               "Now, boys, we have got you!" 
               His party emboldened by the manner of their leader, ran up to the house, while Moses, as soon as he heard the voice, and knew it to be Hart, rushed in upon him to overpower him. Hart let his rifle fall, and closed in upon his enemy. In the heat of the struggle, both fell together on the threshold, and Hart being uppermost, succeeded in keeping that position, by placing his knee upon his breast. In the meantime, the rest of the party had come to the scene of action, and one of a party who had just come from Fisherville, named Gibson, shouted as he came up: 
               "Hold him there a minute till I shoot him!" 
               While Gibson was about to level his piece, Moses motioned with his hand, signifying that he wanted to speak, which he could not on account of the firm grasp which Hart held upon his throat. Hart loosened his grasp, and Moses had scarcely announced his surrender, when Gibson, taking deliberate aim, fired. The ball entered the heart of Moses Doan, and with a convulsive spring upwards, he fell back upon the door-sill, a lifeless corpse. 
               Abraham and Levi, instead of assisting Moses, jumped from a window at the back part of the house to affect their escape. Abraham caught up Mrs. Halsey and placed her upon his back, thus securing a shield for himself, as he ran for his horse, as he knew Hart's party would not shoot for fear of killing the woman. Reaching his horse in this manner, he affected his escape. 
               Levi had hidden himself behind a tree, and the first intimation the pursuers had, as to his whereabouts, was given by himself, in a threat that if they did not let Moses go, he would shoot them all. True to his word, as to the attempt, he raised his rifle, and fired. The ball struck the gun of Col. Hart's younger brother, tearing a splinter from it, and entering the groin of Major Kennedy, who fell to the earth mortally wounded. 
               About an hour after this, Philip Hinkle, known as the old vendue cryer, came to the place, accompanied by several of his neighbors. He approached the corpse of the outlaw, and kicked it off of the steps on the ground, remarking as he done so: 
               "Thank God, the tory is dead at last." 
               Shortly afterwards, without informing any person concerning what he was going to do, he dragged the body of Moses Doan to his horse, laid him on in front of the saddle, mounted himself, and started off with him. He carried him in this way until he reached Fisherville; where, upon seeing his father standing at the door, he came up in front of the house and pitched the body on the porch, saying 
               "There's one of your tory sons-he won't bother us any more." 
               The remains of Moses Doan were placed in a rough box, and he was buried the same night upon the farm of a man named Overholtzer; in the north-east corner of a field, back of the village of Fisherville. The exact spot is not known. 
               A few days after the Doans had thus lost their leader, they had the audacity to go in broad daylight to the residence of John Baily, in Tinicum township; and after tying his son William to a tree, whipped him most unmercifully, and then robbed the house of provisions and everything valuable that it contained. 
               The Legislature of Pennsylvania, on the 8th of September, 1783, in the seventh year of the Commonwealth, passed an "Act to encourage the speedy apprehending and bringing to justice, divers robbers, burglars, and felons," in which a reward of 100 was offered for either Abraham, Mahlon, Levi, or Aaron Doan; and if any citizen in pursuit of them should be killed, his family should receive 300. 
               Mahlon Doan was arrested in Baltimore, in the month of January following, for horse stealing; and while confined in jail awaiting his trial, with heavy fetters upon his limbs, made his escape by cutting off the fleshy part of his heels, so that he could slip the shackles off. He was tracked by the blood from his feet to Fell's Point, but after that nothing was ever heard of him.-It has always been supposed that in a fit of desperation he drowned himself, to avoid punishment for his many offences. 
               Abraham and Levi Doan were arrested about four years afterwards, near Yellow Springs, in Chester county, and not far from the village of Kimberton. After being securely bound they were taken to Philadelphia, where they were tried, condemned and executed. They were hung at Smith's Island, by the Sheriff, Joseph Cowperth wait. 
                
               Joseph Doan, whom Mechlin shot in the mouth, and whom we traced to the Philadelphia prison, remained there about six months, and then was brought up to Newtown, to stand his trial in Bucks county. He did not remain in custody long however, as he broke jail with three other scamps. The next we hear of him he was teaching school in New Jersey, where he remained over a year, under the assumed name of Grover. From there he removed to Canada. 
               One day, an old grey-haired man, in a rickety wagon, drawn by a half-starved horse, was observed loitering about Plumstead meeting house. It was soon ascertained to be none other than Joseph Doan; as the bullet wound in his mouth proved beyond a doubt. He returned to his home as mysteriously as he came. He returned to Bucks county again in 1839, to recover a claim which he alleged was due him, but his appearance causing some little excitement, he was advised to leave, and done so. He died at a very advanced age, in Canada, in the summer of 1847. 
               Aaron also died in Canada, whither he had fled for refuge. He was at one time under sentence of death, at Newark, New Jersey; but was reprieved under the gallows. He ultimately escaped, and died in Canada, as above stated in the year 1810. 
               Joseph Condit, alias Foxy Joe, was hung in 1785, for a street murder, committed in the city of New York. 
               Thus was forever destroyed and annihilated that formidable band, which had been the scourge and terror of this county, for so many years; and thus was restored to the inhabitants, that peace and security which they have ever since enjoyed. May an ever watchful Providence prevent a recurrence of the dreadful scenes we have herein described; and may the present proud position of Bucks county among her sister counties be maintained for many long ages, after that you and I, dear reader, shall have been laid beneath her fertile soil.
