            "Drifting about," or, What "Jeems Pipes, of Pipesville" Saw-and-Did

            DRIFTING ABOUT.
            
               INTRODUCTION.
               THE Beginning! That's the difficulty. In what form can I weave together the
                  incidents of travel and adventure, the experiences and vicissitudes of my life for
                  the last sixteen years?
               Take a seat, my kind reader! Taste that wine. It's cheering and cheerful, isn't
                  it? Light a cigar-or you-Miss or Madame-sip a little tea or coffee, imagine
                  yourself, pray, in a position of entire repose, and listen while I recite what has
                  happened to me "by field and by flood." I'll try not to bore you. The chapters
                  shall be short-and we can pause when you choose.
               I would like, above all things, to interest and amuse you. I will try to give
                  advice worth nothing to those who may
                  hereafter travel over the same lands I have journeyed through. I am told that the
                  Spaniards have a proverb to the effect, that no man has accomplished anything who
                  has not begotten a son, built a house, or written a book. Despite my
                  numerous and persistent efforts to become a respectable married man, there is no
                  such thing as filial affection for me, but I can boast of a noble,
                  gorgeous, and architectural triumph, which is expressed in the musical word "Pipesville." You will find out all about that achievement if you keep
                  me company. And now I proceed to gratify some one who exclaims, "Oh that mine
                  enemy would write a book." It will have some marked peculiarities-it will not have
                  particular 'style'-because I know nothing about 'style,' except getting over
                  several in my native country! There will be little of cohesion, and nothing of
                  vanity in the composition. What I jot down may make some laugh, others weep, a few
                  praise, many censure, but no one will be injured by hearing what I have to
                  say.
               I shall not rely much on fancy, I am going to deal with facts, turn up or trump up
                  what may-funny or precocious, laughable or lugubrious, pithy or puffy, grave or
                  gay.
               Persons more than things, shall engage my attention.
               Reader!-I mean to give you "chat," bald, disjointed chat-it may be, or chatter as
                  some may complain. So put yourself at rest, hearken, be good-natured, let me shake
                  your hand, exclaim "God bless you"-and then begin-
               NOW THEN-
            
            

               I.
               MY FIRST VOYAGE.
               
                   
               
               IN the summer of 1837, I, then a small sized boy, could have been seen wending my
                  way to the St. Katherine's Dock in the good old City of London, to take a look at
                  the ship (which happens to be a bark by the way) in which I had taken passage for
                  New York. She was an old West Indiaman, and had for years been employed in the
                  Sugar trade. Her name was the "Hampton, and the Captain's, David Balderston. Her
                  cabin windows projected, in the style of an old man-o'-war's-man, she had a high
                  poop deck, large portholes, and resembled more an old tub than anything else I know of. I shall not endeavor to
                  draw upon the sensibilities of the reader by endeavoring to depict the grief at
                  parting with relations and friends; or by describing the singular sensations I
                  experienced in driving, for the last time as I thought, through the crowded
                  thoroughfares of my native city in a "Hansom" to the dock gates. The utter
                  uncertainty of the future, as I had no fixed object in view upon landing ill
                  America, only rendered my leaving the old homestead the more exciting; but the
                  picture, even after a lapse of twenty-three years, is still present with me, so
                  much so, that I shall for a moment transfer to paper the little scene in the
                  parlor of our home, for the pleasures of memory are sometimes painfully
                  sweet!-when, for the last time in this life, I heard the voice of affectionate
                  counsel of a father and a sister. The "God bless you, my dear boy," of our only
                  surviving parent (my beloved mother having died two years before), as the tears
                  coursed down his wrinkled face, is still ringing in my ears, and as he placed in
                  my hand a little memento of affection, and with trembling voice said, "may the
                  Lord preserve you, and keep you unto his heavenly kingdom," it seemed as though we
                  should never meet again; and it was with difficulty that I could control my
                  feelings. I shall never forget the look of my sister-long since departed, nor her
                  last words; they will live in my memory for ever. The grave has closed over all
                  save three who were present at that farewell gathering, yet still I
                  cling with undying tenacity and affectionate remembrance to this last scene of my
                  youthful home; and can but hope that we may be in another world reunited.
               The peculiar hurry and scurry on board a New York and London Packet Ship in olden
                  times, is so happily hit off by one whose name I have forgotten, that I am tempted
                  to transcribe it from some manuscript notes I have by me.
               The seamen as usual lighten their labor with song and chorus, and the one they
                  sang on our old ship was peculiarly musical, the chorus of "Old Sally Brown" being
                  given by the whole crew with great emphasis. I took my seat on the upper deck, and
                  listened.
               "Heave away there forward."
               "Ay, ay, Sir."

               
                  
                     [Sailors.] "Sally Brown, oh my dear Sally,
                  Oh Sally Brown. [Chorus.]
                  Sally Brown of Bubble Alley,
                  Oh Sally Brown."
               
               "Avast heaving there, send all aft to clear the boat."
               "Ay, ay, Sir, where are we to stow these casks, Mr. Fisher?"
               "Stow them, Heaven knows, get them in at all events."
               
                  [Woman's voice.] "Captain H., Captain H., there's my Piano still on
                  deck, it will be quite spoiled, indeed it will!"
               "Don't be alarmed, Ma'am, don't be alarmed, as soon as we're under weigh, we'll
                  hoist the cow up and get the Piano down."
               "What, under the cow?"
               "No, Ma'am, but the cow's under the hatchway."
               "Now then, my lads, forward to the windlass."
               
                  "I went to town to get some toddy,
                  Oh Sally Brown,
                  'Twasn't fit for any body
                  Oh Sally Brown!"
               
               "Out there and clear away the jib!"
               "Ay, ay, Sir."
               "Mr. Fisher, how much cable is there out?"
               "Plenty yet, Sir,"-"Heave away, my lads."
               
                  "Sally is a bright Mullattar,
                  Oh Sally Brown,
                  Pretty girl, but can't get at her,
                  Oh Sally--"
               
               "Avast heaving, send the Man up to whip the ladies in."
               "Dear me, I had no idea they did such horrible things aboard ship!"
               "Now, Miss, only set down, and don't be afraid, and you'll be in, in no time. Whip
                  away, my lads, handsomely, steady her with the guy!"
               "Oh dear, oh dear!" [woman.]
               "There Miss, now you're safely landed!"
               
               
                  [Woman.] "Landed am I, I thought I was shipped!" "Very
                  good indeed-very good, Miss, you'll make an excellent sailor!"
               "I should make a better sailor's wife, I guess, Captain."
               "Excellent, allow me to hand you aft-you'll excuse me. Forward now, my men, heave
                  away!"
               
                  "Seven years I courted Sally,
                  Oh Sally Brown,
                  Seven more of Shilly Shally,
                  Oh Sally Brown.
                  She won't wed--"
               
               "Avast heaving-up there and loose the topsails, stretch along the topsail sheets;
                  upon my soul-half these children will be killed, whose child are you?"
               
                  [Child.] "I-d-on't-know."
               "Go, and find out, there's a dear!"
               "Let fall-sheet home-belay starboard sheet-clap on the larboard-belay all that.
                  Now then, Mr. Fisher."
               "Ay, ay, Sir-heave away, my lads."
               
                  "She won't wed a Yankee Sailor,
                  Oh Sally Brown."
               
               "Heave away, my men-heave and in sight. Hurrah, my lads."
               
                  "Sally Brown-oh, my dear Sally,
                  Oh Sally Brown;
                  Sally Brown of Bubble Alley,
                  Oh Sally Brown;
                  Sally was a cross old Granny,
                  Oh--"
               
               "Heave and fall-jib halyards. Hoist away!"
               
                  [Woman.] "Oh dear, oh dear. The clumsy brute has half killed the
                  girl."
               "Don't cry, my dear."
               "Pick up the child, Tom, and shove it out of the way."
               
                  [Tom.] "Where shall I put her?"
               "Oh, any where just now, put her into the Turkey Coop-"
               "Starboard-"

               "I say, clap on some of you he chaps or else get out of the way."
               
                  [Woman."] "Sailor, please mind my bandbox."
               "Starboard."
               "Starboard it is-steady-so-."
               Thus with the trifling matter of maiming half-a-dozen children; upsetting two or
                  three women; smashing the lids of a few trunks; and crushing some bandboxes as
                  flat as a muffin, the ship proceeded on her voyage.
               Oh! the tediousness of this first voyage! for it will scarcely be believed that we
                  were 95 days in reaching New York; a succession of calms, head-winds,
                  strong gales, and indeed every variety of wind and weather was ours. I think it
                  was about the end of August that we entered the harbor of Manhattan-the day a
                  lovely one, and I recollect distinctly being struck by the brightness of the
                  atmosphere, the gaiety and beauty of the craft, with their milk-white sails, that
                  covered the bay; the lovely verdure and bright green foliage of the shore on each
                  side, and the general bustle, lightness, jollity, and go-a-head-atives that
                  pervaded everything, and everybody. And even when the "Pilot" jumped on board and
                  put a "New York Herald" (a small, single sheet in those days!) in the Captain's
                  hand, I felt that I could know him in five minutes, and that without
                  an introduction.
            
            
               II.
               A PEARL STREET BOARDING-HOUSE IN 1837.
               WE landed, if I remember right, at Jersey City, and I and my brother Jack crossed
                  over in a steam tug, with our traps, to the foot of Coenties slip, from thence to
                  a "Boarding House" in Pearl street. Well do I remember the first dinner in our
                  temporary American home. Two long dining tables, covered with a white cloth-that
                  only wanted two or three bodies on them to make the resemblance very vivid to a
                  dissecting room-half a dozen great big white jugs full of cold water, and each one
                  of the boarders with a big corn cob in
                  his mouth. The meats tasted as though they had been all cooked at the same time,
                  and the gravy, seemingly a decoction of oil and dripping, was ladled out of a
                  large bowl, and would have certainly done more justice to the operations of a
                  cart-wheel than to the organs of mastication. The repast wound up with a series of
                  slices of flat pies in round cans, containing brown apples smashed, the "crust" of
                  the institution being all dough, and highly flavored with brown paper and hot
                  tin.
               We sat down to dinner at one o'clock, and at a quarter past not a soul was to be
                  seen!
            
            
               III.
               MY FIRST SAUNTER UP BROADWAY.
               THE heat was intense (it was the month of August) as I strolled up, for the first
                  time, this celebrated thoroughfare.
               In those days the trees, with their bright green leaves and waving branches, were
                  very much more common, making this fashionable promenade picturesque and elegant.
                  The limit of my walk was "White street," whither I was bound to find the
                  whereabouts of my eldest brother. As I turned from Wall street into Broadway, I
                  stood for a moment to look at Old Trinity, and read some of the inscriptions on
                  the tombstones. Broadway was full of life, gaiety, and sunshine. "Kip and Brown's"
                  and "Brower's" stages, some with "four in hand," were rattling up and down-the
                  fare then twelve-and-a-half cents. I recollect distinctly the "pump" opposite the
                  City Hospital, where the "Gingerbread man" used to wash his mouth, the Washington
                  Hotel (where A. T. Stewart's store now stands), and where I first met my esteemed
                  friend Dr. Carnochan and many others.
               The Park Theatre (then the crack house of amusement) was pointed out to me-the
                  City Hall, decidedly the most imposing looking edifice I had yet seen, with the
                  bright green foliage of the trees-the Masonic Hall, where Fanny Wright used to
                  lecture-the Caf de Mille Colonnes of old Palmo, and the large store of Venables
                  & Co. near Chambers street.
            
            
               IV.
               SCENE ON A CANAL BOAT.
               IN the latter end of August I took passage in the steamer "Swallow," Captain
                  McLean, for Albany. The scenery of the magnificent Hudson has been so frequently
                  described by tourists, journalists, and others, that it would be idle for me to
                  attempt to give my earliest or present impressions. Never having, at that time,
                  seen a river bigger than the Thames, I was of course astounded and delighted at
                  its magnitude, and charmed by the variety, richness, and grandeur of its
                  scenery.
               Upon our arrival at Albany I took passage in one of the "Canal Boats" (my stock of
                  money being rather limited) for the "Queen City of the Lakes." We were about eight
                  days in making the "voyage," which was certainly, to me, a very novel affair; the
                  method of making up the "cots" for sleeping purposes being particularly amusing.
                  It was something in the following style. After "supper" was over, three rows of
                  portable cots, attached to each other by ropes swung against the two sides of the
                  boat, resembling more the slats in a baker's oven than a resting-place for the
                  body, and then the passengers, by dint of sundry gymnastic feats, managed to crawl
                  into their holes. The heated and close air soon became insufferable; so I
                  determined to roll myself up in a blanket and he on the deck. But just as I had
                  made up my mind to leave my place of baking, the cot above me, containing a big
                  fat man weighing certainly over three hundred-weight, gave way, falling upon me,
                  and smashing me almost to a jelly. I gave a yell which aroused all the sleepers;
                  at the same moment the "skipper," who was steering, called out "Bridge" too late,
                  however, (the night being dark) to save the head of a poor "Paddy from Cork," who,
                  ignorant of the approaching arch, was by the concussion sent clean overboard, and,
                  but for the shallowness of the stream, would have been instantly drowned. His
                  cries of "Blood and murther!" and such
                  like delicate exclamations, with the crash in the cabin, the shrieks of men,
                  women, and children, rendered the place a perfect pandemonium. The relief I
                  experienced when on the "eighth day out" the glittering cupolas of the city of
                  Buffalo greeted me, it would be difficult to describe.
            
            
               V.
               I BECOME A LAW STUDENT.
               I HAD been in Buffalo about a month, when I entered the office of Mr. Thomas
                  Jefferson Nevins, 200 Main street, exactly opposite the Farmers' Hotel, then (and
                  I believe now) kept by Philip Dorsheimer, the present State Treasurer.
               I think about the third day of my initiation into the mysteries of "Coke upon
                  Littleton," I was directed to serve a paper upon some one in the office of
                  Fillmore, Hall, and Haven, and there and then met a young student, named C--,
                  about whom I shall have something to say here after.
               I used to go by the name of the "red-faced little Englishman;" and I remember Mr.
                  Fillmore speaking very kindly to me, asking me sundry questions as to the time of
                  my being in America, and whether I intended becoming a lawyer, and was assiduous
                  in my studies, &c.
               I do not think, at that time, he ever dreamed of being "President of the United
                  States."
               My duties were not very arduous, consisting chiefly of filling in several blank
                  notices, in which the name "T. R. Beers" was constantly occurring, the only suit
                  (excepting one I bought) the office could boast of for many months; reading
                  occasionally a line or so of "Blackstone's Commentaries," varied with half a page
                  of "Kent," or a speech of "Charles Phillips."
               At intervals I began to study Shakespeare, and it ended in my learning Richard
                  III. by heart, portions of Othello, and a scene or so from Macbeth.
               About this time "Ben Rathbun" burst up, and Buffalo was in a great state of
                  excitement thereat. A paper called the "Buffalonian" was started by a Mr.
                  Arlington, its editor and proprietor, who was imprisoned in the Buffalo Jail for
                  libel. This gentleman afterwards came to New York, and is now lecturing on
                  Catholicism.
               Brown, Buckland, and Co. were celebrated bankers in those days, and were decidedly
                  the most notable men about town. They had a private box at the theatre, and drove
                  a first-rate team on the macadamized road. Brown died years ago, and John Buckland
                  married the beautiful Miss Kate Horn.
            
            
               VI.
               THE EAGLE STREET THEATRE.
               THE first play I saw in America was in this city; it was Richard the Third, and
                  Mr. Charles H. Eaton was the hero of the night. The names of the managers were
                  Dean and McKenny, but a Mr. Thompson (an Englishman) had something to do with the
                  internal arrangements, and to him it was that I was indebted for an occasional
                  "order." The first opera I ever saw was Cinderella, with Edwin as the Prince, and
                  Miss Melton (sister of Charles Walcot) as the Princess. Among the performers was a
                  Miss Powell, a beautiful English girl, who afterwards became Mrs. Charles
                  Walcot.
               Here I first saw the play of the Lady of Lyons, with Ellen Tree as Pauline, and
                  Mr. Fredericks as Claude. Mr. Fredericks is, I believe, at present in the city,
                  and Miss Ellen Tree, as all the world knows, has long since been Mrs. Charles Kean
                  (whom I had the pleasure of meeting at a party in London in 1858, just twenty
                  years afterwards!).
               It is useless to deny the fact, that I became seized with a desire to "go upon the
                  stage;" and the great amount of time I had upon my hands gave me opportunities for
                  studying, thus fanning the flame which I fancied would burst forth and electrify
                  everybody. A lot of young students started a Thespian Society, and our first
                  performance took place on the Kremlin Block. The play was (of course) Richard; I enacting the "crooked-backed tyrant,"
                  and my friend C-- the student, Richmond. Lady Anne was played by a Mr. O-and the
                  Queen by another limb of the law. I got along pretty well until the last scene
                  with Richmond; but as with the words, "My soul and body on the action both," we
                  struck the usual attitude to commence the fight, my sword, being made of wood
                  covered with tin, snapped in two pieces, one end taking effect on the eye of the
                  leader of the "orchestra," a small-sized boy, who immediately dropped his
                  instrument (a broken-keyed melodeon), and ran out of the building crying. This
                  mishap, of course, killed the scene, and the words, "Perdition catch my arm,"
                  & c., were entirely lost in a whirlwind of laughter and shouting. The comical
                  termination of the play rather damped my theatrical ardor; and when it became
                  known to our employers that we belonged to an association of the kind, our fun was
                  at an end, and our acting days and nights numbered.
               Probably one of the most exciting incidents of the year 1838 that occurred in
                  Buffalo was the burning of the steamer Caroline and the occupation of Navy Island
                  by the citizen soldiery. The city, wore a very military aspect, the English were
                  denounced, and the Buffalonians were ripe for a fight with John Bull.
               A mass meeting was held at the Theatre, when the Canadian patriot (?), William
                  Lyon Mackenzie, addressed the meeting, together with Mr. Seth C. Hawley, one of
                  the then leading men of the bar, whose remark of "Be sure you're right, then go
                  ahead," brought down from the sympathizers a storm of applause. The streets were
                  eternally filled with the paradings of military companies, "City Guards" were
                  formed, drums and fifes and bands of music were heard from morning to night, and
                  the excitement lasted for days.
               A great sensation was also created here by the announcement in the daily papers of
                  the arrival at New York of the steamship Sirius, and a few days after of the
                  British Queen, in which came passengers Madame Vestris and Mr. Charles
                  Mathews.
               During my sojourn in Buffalo, I made a brief trip to the Falls of Niagara, and of
                  course was delighted therewith. They have been described so graphically and
                  minutely from time immemorial, that I shall not attempt it; but this I confess: my
                  first impression was certainly one of disappointment. I had imagined the fall of
                  water much higher than I found it, fully expecting to see it come down from the
                  clouds, or somewhere in that vicinity.
            
            
               VII.
               DRIFTING.
               THINKING the chances very slim of my ever becoming distinguished at the bar, and
                  not being able to penetrate at all into the mysteries of Coke, Kent, Blackstone,
                  or "any other man," I left the handling of law books, foolscap, and red tape, for
                  the counting-house of a "forwarding merchant" on the Dock, by name, Mr. A. H.
                  Scoville; a delightful person, by the way, who treated me most kindly, and, as far
                  as his means would permit, liberally.
               The store was very long and my duties very short. My "boss" was supposed to sell
                  flour on commission, and I think, when I arrived to take charge of the "books" and
                  keep the cash, there were just four barrels at one end of the store, which was
                  about 100 feet deep. This struck me as being rather a light stock; but I had an
                  accompanying sensation of consolation that my duties as "bookkeeper" would be
                  proportionably easy. My inward feeling of horror ror at the idea of "opening a set of books"
                  (excepting Scott's, Bulwer's, or Cooper's novels), can be imagined by the reader,
                  when I inform him that when running up a column of figures, the
                  result was always entirely different from the running down; and that
                  as to what should go to the "Dr." and what should go to the "Cr." side of the
                  "Cash" or "Day" Book, I was in a state of blissful ignorance. My "boss" was an
                  extremely pleasant, kind-hearted man, and came to my relief like a good fellow,
                  when the momentous time arrived for me to make the first (and I believe the last)
                  entry. I happened to write a good hand, and this was half the battle, and my
                  employer was only too happy to relieve the monotony of the day, usually passed in
                  "whittling," walking the dock, or chewing tobacco, by doing the "cyphering"
                  portion of the books. Business did not "look up, and my boss and his solitary
                  clerk looked "down." My brother had written from New York that he had a situation
                  as assistant bookkeeper, collector, & c., in a large carpet
                  warehouse. I packed up my "duds," bade good-bye to many kind friends in Buffalo,
                  and landed, in the summer of '39, once again in Gotham, and immediately made for
                  the store of Thomas L. Chester, 203 Broadway.
               Here I went duly to work as out-door clerk, and occasionally salesman. I was here
                  about a year and a half, during which time a few singular incidents occurred. I
                  will mention one or two.
               I was living for a short time at the Broadway Hotel, 112 Broadway, kept by Cotter
                  & Leveret, and being extremely fond of music, and haying a pretty good voice,
                  was introduced to and "patronized" by several musical celebrities. At this hotel I
                  first met Mr. Giubelei, the then celebrated basso of the Park Theatre, who, with
                  his wife, and Miss Poole, were singing then in opera, together with Mrs. Martyn
                  (ne Miss Inverarity) and Mr. Martyn, and Mr. Manvers (the latter now in
                  England).
               Many pleasant walks had I with the "pretty little Miss Poole" on the Battery,
                  winding up with a cozy little goter at the Hotel
                  Franaise, near Peter Harmony's, on Broadway. Mr. Giubelei frequently gave me
                  "orders," and once or twice I was admitted behind the scenes. I was delighted; and
                  Theatre Alley, with the "stage-door" entrance, had many more charms for me than a
                  lounge on the Fifth Avenue has to-day.
               At a concert at the City Hotel, given by Mr. Charles E. Horn, I had the pleasure
                  of being introduced by him to the author of "Woodman, spare that tree," General
                  George P. Morris. Upon the occasion referred to, Mrs. C. E. Horn sang, for the
                  first time in New York, the "Northern Refrain," or "Through the streets of New
                  York city," a little chimneysweep's carol, written by General Morris. The song was
                  a great success, being enthusiastically encored, and, when published, met with an
                  extraordinary sale. In those days I was very young, and proportionably modest, and
                  was very much taken by the "General's" kind and genial manner in shaking hands
                  with me; little dreaming then that I should ever in public sing his
                  songs, or be criticized by him in his Journal. I shall take the liberty of
                  referring again to this genial and delightful song writer.
               In this year the opera of Amilie, or the Love Test, was produced at the National
                  Theatre in Leonard street, under the management of the veteran James W. Wallack,
                  of this city. There was a dress rehearsal one Saturday night, and I had a card of
                  admission. The vocalists engaged had recently arrived from England. Their names
                  were Miss Jane Shirreff, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. and Mrs. Edward Seguin.
               The stage was lighted up, chairs were placed for the "principals," and when the
                  time came for the aria, "My boyhood's home," on walked Mr. Seguin, in his rough
                  pea jacket, as if just from sea, and with his magnificent voice charmed every one
                  present by the rendering of this popular melody. The opera was a great success,
                  and ran for many consecutive nights, and the "trio," particularly "Ned Seguin,"
                  were for a long time the pets of the public.
               About this time, also, Mr. Washington Coster, (who then resided at 61 White
                  street, his sleeping apartment being now used as the publication office of
                  "Porter's Spirit," and his once upon a time gorgeous parlor now the shop of a
                  German tailor,) recently returned from Paris, created quite a sensation among the
                  beau monde, by the introduction in Broadway of an open style of "Landau," in which
                  he, his beautiful wife, and lovely children, used to ride. He was quite a remarkable-looking man, with long flaxen
                  hair, falling over his shoulders, mounted by a broad-rimmed, oval-shaped black
                  hat. Dandy Marx was also one of the notables, as was also George L. Pride, whom
                  the Herald, in one of its sketchy, descriptive articles, dubbed the "Pride of the
                  Road." These gentlemen, and their establishments, were all lithographed by a Mr.
                  Baker, of Wall street, (now the efficient Fire Marshal,) and the caricatures
                  created a great commotion, and caused much amusement about town.
               My first legitimate theatrical sensation was at the National Theatre, in 1839,
                  when I was Entranced and delighted with the representations of Mr. Edwin Forrest
                  in Richelieu and King Lear; and at the present writing, though twenty years have
                  intervened, the impressions of my youth remain.
               I have recently seen this distinguished actor, in the characters above referred
                  to, at Niblo's Garden, under the management of Mr. William Wheatley; and although,
                  on the one hand, as my ancient friend Mrs. Malaprop observed, "Comparisons are
                  odorous," and, on the other, I have no intention of being invidious or personal, I
                  conceive the genius of this great actor, in these impersonations, towers so
                  immeasurably above the efforts of all others I have seen, that it is simply
                  ridiculous to place them in the same category.
               In those days the Battery was the fashionable promenade, and in the summer months,
                  from four to six and seven, the lower part of Broadway was filled with beautiful
                  and gaily-dressed women and handsome men, wending their way to the Bowling Green,
                  to enjoy the cooling breezes and shady walks of the dear old Battery. I know that
                  I caught the "fever," and upon the slightest provocation, in the shape of a
                  request to go and collect a bill, or do any "out-door" business, I would find time
                  to pay my respects to this favorite locality. Besides, I fear I must briefly
                  inform thee, my patient reader, that about these days a pair of hazel eyes had
                  made fearful havoc with my young and tender heart and affections, and it was in
                  daily expectation of receiving a pleasant smile or nod from my inamorata that I
                  hurried my way thitherward. Twenty years ago! how changed the scene! Then the
                  nicely-gravelled walks, (the centre one was my favorite,) the shady branches of
                  the trees waved on high their "plumes of green"-though the "worms" that hung from
                  them were rayther annoying-the bright waters of the bay, with a fleet
                  of craft of every name and size floating on its bosom, and Castle Garden, with its
                  bath-houses and refreshment saloons, all, all, crowd upon my memory with the most
                  vivid and delightful recollections and associations. Now a dreary and desolate
                  waste, is this once upon a time fashionable resort, and a Dept for Emigrants
                  reigns where the Baths of Dr. Rabineau invited the swimmers, or the dulcet tones
                  of Jenny Lind were first heard.
               The fashionable music stores and lounges for musical people, at the date I am
                  writing, were Atwill's Music Saloon, at the sign of the Golden Lyre, 201 Broadway;
                  Millett's, Broadway (Mr. Millet still remaining in the same store); Firth and
                  Hall, Franklin square; and Davis and Horn, of Broadway.
               The first establishment, being next door to my place of business, I quickly became
                  acquainted with its proprietor, Mr. Joseph F. Atwill, (now and for a long time
                  past a resident of California,) and many a delightful hour was passed by me there,
                  and I was thus brought into immediate connexion, if not intimacy, with numbers of
                  musical people.
               Among the celebrities that in the year 1840 flashed for a while upon the musical
                  horizon, and who were daily to be seen at Joe Atwill's, were Braham, Joseph Philip
                  Knight, (the author of "She wore a wreath of roses,") Signor De Begnis, Henry
                  Russell, Mrs. Edward Loder, Mrs. Sutton, (an American prima donna,) Madame Dolores
                  de Goi (guitarist), and Mr. Henry C. Watson, a young English musician and
                  composer, who has since made his mark as one of the very best critics of this
                  city, and who was the arbiter of matters musical in the old times of the Albion,
                  the Evening Signal, and the New World.
               Here very often was to be seen a handsome, rosy-cheeked, dark-haired,
                  sailor-looking fellow, who used to delight me by the off-hand and brilliant manner
                  of his "touch" at the piano, and it was not long before we "froze" to each other,
                  he being pleased with my singing, I with his playing, and there are many alive now
                  who will remember the kind-hearted
                  hearted, jolly, and good-natured "Jack Poole," with a tear of regret; for he was
                  lost in the steamer Erie, with three hundred others, which was burnt on the lake
                  of that name about this period. John Poole was distinctly a musical genius; for
                  without the slightest knowledge of the art, or acknowledging any method, he would
                  rattle off the most brilliant and original compositions, consisting principally of
                  waltzes, polkas, & c., and went so far as to publish a set, called the
                  Amaranth Waltzes, which became quite the rage, dedicated to Miss Mary Jones, a
                  great belle at that time. My friend Colonel Jim Burnham (afterwards City Marshal)
                  will remember the pleasant evening we had with poor John Poole at a family
                  gathering in the "old homestead" on the Bloomingdale road.
               The Tabernacle, in Broadway, and the Apollo Booms, were the fashionable places
                  where concerts were given.
               On the first night of the veteran Braham's appearance in America, it rained in
                  torrents; but, in spite of wind and weather, the Tabernacle was crowded to
                  overflowing. He was assisted by Mrs. Edward Loder, as the principal lady vocalist,
                  who chose this occasion to present herself for the suffrages of the New York
                  public. Mrs. Loder's classical method and sweet voice were greatly appreciated by
                  the audience; and for many years she was one of the leading features of the
                  concerts given in this city; certainly, no sacred concert seemed complete without
                  the appearance of this lady. I remember a remark that Braham made, upon her
                  observing to him that she thought he appeared "a little nervous," and that she was
                  surprised that he, who for more than half a century had appeared before audiences
                  in every part of the world, should exhibit any agitation upon a first appearance
                  in America:-"Ah, my dear madam, it is appearing before a nation for
                  the first time." Braham sang with all his former fire and vigor, and his debut was
                  highly successful. He sang "Martin Luther's Hymn," with trumpet accompaniment of
                  the Celebrated John T. Norton, and "Comfort ye, my people," from the Messiah. The
                  tickets were one dollar each, and the Tabernacle crowded to suffocation.
               At the Park Theatre, in this year, Power, the Irish actor, was in all his glory;
                  filling the house nightly, and delighting everybody. It was in 1840 that he left
                  New York in the ill-fated steamship President; and I well remember seeing him in
                  Wall street, whither I had gone to collect an account at the Banking-house of
                  Prime, Ward, and King, then the great guns in the banking line; and Power, with
                  his hat a little cocked on the side of his head, and a closely buttoned coat with
                  fur collar, was chatting with John Povey on the corner of William street.
                  Curiosity led me to the steamer, and I saw poor Power go up the plank, shaking
                  hands with many friends who had come to bid him good-bye. I particularly noticed a
                  very melancholy expression in his face, and I believe he remarked to an intimate
                  acquaintance that, when it came to the point of starting, he did not care to
                  leave, or words to that effect. It will be remembered that the steamer returned
                  after an absence of a day or so, some accident having occurred to the machinery,
                  and left again never to be seen or heard of more! Power had with him in cash,
                  $50,000, the results of his engagements in America, and I believe it was his
                  intention to pass the remainder of his days in retirement.
            
            
               VIII.
               A FULL AND TRUE ACCOUNT OF MY FIRST AND LAST DEPOSIT IN A SAVINGS
                  BANK.
               IN this year, I "opened," I think they call it, an account at the Chambers street
                  Savings Bank. By dint of extraordinary exertion, and depriving myself of many
                  luxuries, I had managed to save up some $16 in hard cash. Now, I had been informed
                  when quite a small boy, that if I only commenced to save my coppers and deposit
                  them in bank, by the time I was one-and-twenty those coppers would, by some
                  wonderful system of "hocus pocus," amount to a small fortune. The famous motto,
                  "take care of the pence, and the pounds will take care of themselves," had not
                  only been stuck up in every nook and corner of our house, and written in large
                  text hand in my copy-books, but seemed-so strongly was it engraven on my memory-to
                  have been sandwiched with every piece of
                  bread and butter I had taken, from my school-boy days and upwards.
               It was, therefore, that on a bright summer afternoon, about the hour of two, I
                  wended my way from Chester's carpet store, 203 Broadway (now the gorgeous
                  head-quarters of Hegeman & Co., the druggists, the house with which my old
                  friend Harry King has been so long connected), to the Chambers street Savings
                  Bank, with a roll of dirty one dollar bank-notes in one hand, and a lot of carpet
                  bills for collection in the other.
               I arrived at the portals of the institution, trembling from head to foot with the
                  frightful responsibility of my position, and with shaky fingers, counting over and
                  over again, the greasy pieces of paper, taking my place among files of
                  chambermaids, cooks, waiters, carmen, mechanics, young and old, fat and thin,
                  clean and dirty.
               I think it was about four o'clock before my time came.
               Arrived at the hole and looking through some wire grating, I beheld an elderly
                  gentleman with a very bald head, seated on a very high stool, having on the top of
                  his very red nose a pair of the largest kind of spectacles.
               I managed to get off the fact, that I wished to open an account there, to which he
                  replied, in a very gruff and disagreeable voice,-
               "Well, sir! what's the amount?" To which I hesitatingly replied, $16 sir."
               Gruntingly, "$16 that all?" (Here an audible titter from two or three of the
                  clerks, and instantly caught up by the whole row of depositors, made me so nervous
                  that I nearly fainted, and I'd have given all the world if I'd been
                     outside instead of in!)
               In a book about the size of a Chinese trunk, with a couple of brass clasps, as big
                  as the hinges of St. Paul's church door, the fatal entry, was made; and in another
                  book, of not quite so large dimensions, another entry was made, and
                  the last book handed to me with the request that I would always
                     bring it when making any future deposits!
               This I faithfully promised to do. These proceedings seemed to take an age.
               How I made my way out of the bank I know not-but, upon gaining the street, I felt
                  my penniless situation, and bitterly regretted the step I had taken. I awoke in
                  the morning feeling certain the bank would break. When sent out to collect a bill
                  of carpeting, I invariably walked down Chambers street to see if the Institution
                  had not closed; and every alarm of fire set me in a high fever.
               This suspense took away my appetite. I must feign sickness or a death in the
                  family, or a journey westward, or something-but the money I must have-though I
                  felt perfectly ashamed to go in, and get it-
               What would the man in the spectacles say? what would he do? why he
                  would wither me with a look! but get it out I must; and in I went, wondering all
                  the time what excuse I should give him.
               The money had been in the bank I think forty-eight hours-perhaps a little more
                  perhaps a little less-and after wasting a quire of paper in trying to get out what
                  the simple, or the compound interest, or both would be, at-I didn't know how much
                  per cent. per annum-I found myself at the dreaded hole with the wire round it.
               To the interrogatory, "What is it, Sir?"
               I feebly replied that I had a little "account to settle" with him!
               Now whether the old cock thought I was going to punch him in the eye or throw
                  something at him through the little hole, I know not, but he involuntarily drew
                  back, saying,
               "I don't understand you, Sir!"
               "Well, Sir," said I, the fact is, Sir, I deposited some money here the other day
                  (all this time the people were crowding and pressing in, the heat was intense, and
                  I in a perfect vapor bath of excitement), and in consequence of a large death in
                  our small family. Sir, I have to go to sea."
               "See what, Sir? I don't comprehend you, Sir!"
               "No, no, Sir! I mean a sea voyage, Sir. I want the money for an outfit, Sir; to
                  pay my passage to Rhode Island, Sir; where the ship is, Sir."
               Oh Lor! I was nearly fainting, but I then intended to "stick it out."
               With a look of perfect contempt at me over his specks, that haunted me for years
                  afterwards, he fumbled over the leaves of his big book with the clasps, came to
                  the unfortunate letter "M," and with pointed finger at the wretched item (I saw from the top my name in large letters
                  occupying the two entire sheets), gave a "click" with the pen, went to the drawer,
                  and counting out the sixteen dollars, added, with a sneer, that there was just
                     one cent interest due me!
               
               Then, with a look of intense disgust at me and my red face, he very impertinently,
                  I thought, suggested, that the next time I made a deposit in a
                  banking house I should have something to put in it!
            
            
               IX.
               MORE FUNNY SCENES.
               WHEN my outdoor duties were over, it was the wish of my employer that I should, as
                  he called it, "lay hold of" the customers, particularly if we were short of
                  salesmen, or if they were engaged. Now I must premise that my knowledge of the
                  different varieties of carpet was about as clear and lucid as my arithmetical, and
                  accordingly I was all the while making mistakes in the different qualities.
               One of these occasions I distinctly remember. A lady alighted from her carriage,
                  and there being at the time no one in the store, I, of course, did the bidding of
                  my "boss," and laid hold of her, that is to say, I asked her the style of carpet
                  she wished to look at. "Super ingrain," said she. "Step this way if you please,
                  Mum," said I; upon which I asked Michael, the porter, to show the lady a "roll"
                  of, what I supposed, the latest pattern of "ingrain." The lady was delighted, the
                  pattern was charming, and she ordered sixty yards, the price being eight shillings
                  and sixpence a yard. I immediately rushed to the order-book, feeling quite proud
                  that I had actually made a sale, and feeling also an inward conviction that my
                  salary would be instantly raised. The carpet was cut off, and actually in the
                  cart, when, to my horror and astonishment, the "Col," as we called the head of the
                  house, caught a glimpse of the departing drug-get, and calling out to the carman
                  to bring it back, exclaimed claimed, "Why, who the devil's been selling 'Super
                  Royal Wilton' for 'Ingrain?' Is that you, Sir?" said he, addressing me. I
                  remarked, "that I was directed to 'lay hold of' the customers, and in doing so had
                  committed the unpardonable sin of selling a three dollar and fifty cents a yard
                  carpet for one that would cost only eight shillings and sixpence!"
               It was in vain for me to plead ignorance of the different varieties or qualities.
                  I was looked upon, and called "a stupid ass," and fell several degrees lower in
                  the estimation of everybody.
               
                  
                     YE TERRIFIC BOSS
                  
               
               I recollect upon another occasion, a man came in to look at one of Hare &
                  Son's oil cloths; this was to me perfectly distressing, for I never
                     could get "the hang" of the difference between a "square" and a
                  "running" yard, and many a sheet of paper have I wasted in endeavoring to
                  understand the mystery.
               He selected the cloth, and wished to know (giving me the length and breadth of his
                  entry) how many running or square yards it would require, and how much the square
                  or the running yard was! I was nervous to a degree and perspiring from head to foot, my moist fingers
                  bedaubing the paper with blotches of ink, and upon the inquiry of my employer as
                  to what I made it, I found the paper covered with caricatures and all sorts of
                  "figures" but the right ones. My brother came to my relief and I incontinently
                  "sloped."
               "Whether it was in this year or not I do not remember,' but somewhere about this
                  time my head was felt by the celebrated Mr. Coombe, and he told me that I had
                     not the bump of "calculation," that I might possibly know that 2
                  and 2 made 4, but I could never, by any possible chance, learn the multiplication
                  table.
               The only article in the store that I felt at all easy in offering for sale was
                  "binding;" this being only sixpence a yard I could manage to get through my thick
                  head the price of any moderate number of yards. My success was really
                  great in "getting off" this valuable article.
               One warm day in summer, I was standing alone in the store, when in walked a little
                  man very seedily dressed, with a very unsteady gait, a glassy look of the eye, and
                  compressed lips. He caught hold of the railing that surrounded the desk, and
                  looking me straight in the eye, said, "Do-you-know-who-I am-young-man?" I replied,
                  "that I had not the honor." "N-o-r didshe-never-she-me-afore?" "No sir," I said.
                  "Well-shir-my names-Booth-and I wish-look at sucarpits." "With pleasure, sir." I
                  was about to explain the different styles, when, to my surprise, he abruptly
                  turned round, and growled out that he'd see me-first, slammed the door and
                  left.
               There are a good many who will remember "Jim Grant," the Ann street barber. I was
                  first taken there by a countryman of mine, shortly after my arrival from England,
                  it being the best place, I was informed, to have my hair cut, in the city. Mr. J.
                  G. Bennett was among his regular patrons, and I believe for years enjoyed the
                  luxury of one of "Jimmy's" best shaves. Well, it was in this identical shop that I
                  met a gentleman one evening, to whom I had been previously introduced, who, as
                  will shortly appear, had a great deal to do in changing the whole current of my
                  life, and directing my young thoughts to matters not at all allied to my duties as
                  clerk in a carpet store. Turning to he said, "I heard you sing 'My Boyhood's Home'
                  devilish well the other evening-you've got a capital voice and ought to make
                  (excuse the joke) capital out of it! Why don't you go on the
                  stage?"
               My first impression was, that my friend was poking fun at me, or perhaps I had not
                  heard distinctly, and he had asked me to ride up in a stage. The reply I made, I
                  forget, but it ended in our strolling up Broadway together, going in to John
                  Anderson's cigar shop next the hospital, and getting one shilling's worth of
                  cigars, handed us by the pretty Mary Rogers, who so suddenly disappeared and was
                  supposed to have been murdered in Hoboken. John has made a fortune, and can be
                  daily seen at his wholesale factory, on the corner of Cedar street and Broadway.
                  Well, my friend A-having expressed a wish to introduce me to Mr. Latham, the
                  manager of the Charleston Theatre, we dropped in upon him at his residence at the
                  "Halleck House," on the corner of Reade and Broadway. We found him at home, and at
                  his request I sang him one or two songs-"The Lads of the Village" and "Oh! would I
                  were a boy again." He remarked that I had a voice that would realize for me some
                  day a fortune, and that he would be most happy to have me accompany him to
                  Charleston-that he would instruct me in music, and indeed do any and everything to
                  forward my interest, and bring me out successfully. This was the first time that I
                  had at all realized the force of my friend A.'s remark in the Barber's shop, that
                  I should "go on the stage." The idea haunted me; I felt that I never was intended
                  for a business man; figures and accounts were a dead letter to me; of music I was
                  passionately fond, had a quick ear, a retentive memory, and everybody said, a
                  first-rate voice. About this time the carpet trade being a little slack, I
                  obtained through the kindness of an old and esteemed friend, a situation in the
                  office of W. C. Pickersgill & Co., in Wall street, at a salary of $500 a year;
                  but what my actual position or duties were, I never could ascertain, nor did I
                  fully appreciate the awful hornets' nest I had voluntarily got into, in the shape
                  of arithmetical troubles, until I had passed my first week in that dread
                  counting-room.
               
               My friend, Col. L. (the book-keeper), was a very facetious person, and knew full
                  well when he offered me the "berth," not only that I had a horror of figures, but
                  was actually ignorant of the method of keeping the simplest accounts; and to this
                  day, I believe he thought it a good joke, and inwardly enjoyed the nervous state
                  of excitement and agony of mind I was constantly in, when engaged in some (to me)
                  abstruse calculation, and which I tried in vain to conceal. He had distinctly told
                  me, that my duties would be very simple, and that I was looked upon as his
                  assistant, and when any difficulty presented itself in the shape of a
                  "calculation," he could assist me, and, in fact, "put me through."
               After the first two or three days, I began to gain a little confidence-and so
                  certain did I feel my footing to be, although my "footing up" was always so shaky
                  in the establishment, and so easy my affairs prospectively seemed in money
                  matters, that I immediately rushed to Reynolds's outfitting shop in Broadway near
                  Cedar, and ordered a dozen shirts, and sundry other necessaries, to replenish my
                  scanty wardrobe.
               I have informed the reader before, that I wrote a pretty good hand; accordingly
                  had a lot of accounts to enter in a large book, letters to copy, etc., my
                  caligraphic powers being universally admired from the principal (my friend the
                  "Col." calling his particular attention thereto) to the office boy. I was not
                  destined long to enjoy the dignities of my position as junior clerk in the house
                  of W. C. P. & Co., for whether from an intuitive knowledge of my deficiencies,
                  or from noticing, upon one occasion, my agitated state in going up and down a
                  column of figures for almost half a day, and the result never being the same
                     twice-I say, the cause I know not, but certain it is, that while
                  trying to add up a column, he put a piece of paper on my book, which, as I glanced
                  at it askance, I felt in a moment was a death-knell to my hopes, prospects, and
                  position, as assistant book-keeper, in that highly influential, wealthy, and
                  aristocratic banking-house. My boss wished to test my arithmetical powers, and had
                  given me some such problem as the following:-

               "I wish to buy a draft on London, through a house in Philadelphia at Pa, or Ma (I
                  forget which), at 3 per cent for 198, 4, which amount give me in American money,
                  and calculate the compound interest at 7 per cent, per annum, payable quarterly in
                  advance."
               I have never known the sensation of sea-sickness, and very rarely felt sick at the
                  stomach; but for the moment, I thought I should have fallen off the stool, I
                  became faint, the perspiration started from my forehead in rows of beads, and
                  dripped from the ends of my fingers, and if the executioner had stood by me, with
                  a rope around my neck, I am sure my anguish would not have been more intense.
                  There stood Mr. Pick, looking at his unfortunate "Newman Noggs," my eyes became
                  filmy, my head dizzy, and I looked in vain for a consoling glance or word of
                  assistance from the head book-keeper. Mr. Pick left me to make the "calculation;"
                  in vain I tried-my paper was covered with figures-I went over to the Exchange
                  Reading-Room to get a look at the Philadelphia Inquirer, and other journals,
                  vainly supposing I might get some information, at any rate, in their money
                  articles, upon the subject. I got at the interest tables-made sundry
                  gesticulations to the "Col." to do it for me, but he, the last plank to which I
                  clung, slipped from under me, and in my hour of tribulation-was-"nowhar." My time
                  was up, and oh! horror-from the inner-room, the sanctum sanctorum, the place where
                  no sound louder than a whisper was ever heard, where no one hardly dared to enter,
                  but privileged persons, and where the high railings of mahogany, covered with
                  green silk, kept entirely hidden from the vulgar gaze the distinguished individual
                  who was to decide my fate, and in whose presence I felt a degree of mental agony
                  and nervous excitement never experienced before or since;-from this chamber of
                  terrors, issued the words, in a sort of sympathizing and conciliatory tone: "Mr.
                  Massett, will you step in this way if you please?" My time had come at last, and I
                  felt a melancholy relief, I thought he couldn't do much more than discharge me,
                  and my poor brain had been so bothered with the infernal figures that I rather
                  preferred to leave than otherwise. "The head of the house of W. C. P. & Co.
                     suggested gested that he thought I was
                  not sufficiently advanced in the mysteries of book-keeping and accounts to be of
                  any very great assistance to their firm, and that, though I could remain until I
                  had found another 'berth,' he thought it necessary to engage a more experienced
                  accountant."
               I left the presence-my first feeling being one of uncertainty as to how I was
                  going to pay for my dozen shirts, and sundry other articles that I had
                  prospectively bought-and I wended my way to my boarding-house, kept by Mrs.
                  Waterbury (mother to the distinguished Nelson J.), No. 4 Dey street, in a very
                  melancholy state of mind.
               In a day or two after these events, I met again my friend A-, who informed me
                  that, on the following Saturday, the schooner Signet, Captain Knudson, would sail
                  for Charleston, and he advised me very strongly to go in her.
            
            
               X.
               COMIC SCENES AT THE CHARLESTON (S. C.) THEATRE.
               SOMEWHERE in the month of November, 1841, I arrived in Charleston, S. C., and
                  proceeded at once to the residence of Mr. Latham, the manager, at the Victoria
                  Hotel, in King street. I was emphatically a stranger in a strange land; he, at
                  that time, being the only person I had ever even spoken to in that city. The
                  business of the theatre had been very bad, and he had not the sweetest temper
                  imaginable, and the consequence was that I was not greeted by him in the most
                  affectionate or agreeable manner.
               The promise he had made me in New York was, that I was to be by him well
                  instructed and informed in matters musical, and referring to the stage, before I
                  made my first appearance, in speaking, attitudinizing, and all that sort of thing;
                  in fact, I was to look upon myself as his pupil, and that he would be in no hurry
                  to bring me out, wishing me to feel, before that momentous time arrived, perfectly
                  composed and at ease in my new occupation.

               The reader can then judge of my surprise, when upon the third day of my arrival,
                  upon strolling leisurely into the "Green Room," Mr. Latham said to me, "What two
                  songs will you sing to-morrow night, sir?"
               I was astonished and frightened, and suggested that I was not prepared to make my
                  appearance so soon, reminding him of his promise in New York of instruction, to
                  which he replied, in the most heartless manner, "Oh, I can't afford to be paying
                  idle people, or wait till it suits their convenience. I thought you had a hundred
                  songs at your torque's end." I felt it would be useless to argue-useless to back
                  out. I had made my bed, and meant to lie in it. I mentioned two. "The Light of
                  other Days," and "Oh! Would I were a Boy again." "Where are your parts, sir?" said
                  Mr. Latham. "My what, sir?" said I; for I really did not know his meaning. "Why
                  (with a fearful expletive) your orchestral parts. You can't sing without
                  orchestral parts, sir-where are they?" I quietly said I never had any, and of that
                  fact he must have been aware! With another oath, he took the songs, and in a short
                  time returned with the "band parts," he being a capital musician, and I, for the
                  first time, at rehearsal, sang the songs to an orchestral accompaniment. They went
                  well, and all congratulated me upon my maiden effort.
               The night of my "first appearance upon any stage" was to me a
                  momentous occurrence; and though my duties upon that occasion were very simple,
                  the state of mental prostration under which I labored during the whole of that
                  day, I shall never forget. I could eat nothing-I could drink nothing; and as the
                  hour approached for proceeding to the theatre, I felt more like a convict going to
                  execution than anything else. The performances commenced with (as the bills said)
                  the "Heir at Law," after which a "Concert," in which Mr. Stephens (myself) would
                  make his first appearance as a vocalist. I was not needed before nine o'clock, yet
                  I thought it necessary to be "on hand" by seven. The entrance to the stage-door
                  was up a long, dirty alley, which in rainy weather was ankle deep in mud and
                  water, with all sorts of chunks of wood and stray bricks lying about loose; but
                  who ever heard of a stage entrance to be in any other condition? Well, up this
                  gloomy lane I stumbled, and felt for the
                  gloomier door, which, opening rather against its inclination, hindered by a big
                  leaden weight attached to a long rope, closed with a bang that made me jump about
                  a foot.
               A dismal light revealed to my wondering eyes, very dimly though, the pathway, and
                  likewise articles of every name, size, color, and style, with which this
                  subterranean abode seemingly was filled.
               There were broken chairs, stools, and tables, rusty helmets, swords, guns, pikes,
                  banners, flags, thrones, sceptres, palaces, castles, streets, gardens, fountains,
                  flower-pots, ships, thunder and lightning, clocks, bells, rain, hail, fishes,
                  goblets, bottles, sky, sea, land, forests, torches, coffins, scaffolds, pokers,
                  gravel walks made of canvas, rail-roads, boots, shoes, traps, paint, paste, paper,
                  loaves of bread made of wood, balls, kettles, tea cups, coffee pots, cups and
                  saucers, broken china, tin plates, shot, sheet iron, masks, bricks, mortar,
                  spiders, rats, mice, flies, dust and dirt!
               At last I found myself in the "greenroom," where those not wanted on the stage are
                  supposed to wait until they are "called for."
               I knew no one-spoke to no one, and tried very hard to keep cool." It was the month
                  of December, and though very near Christmas, the night was uncomfortably warm.
               The comedy over, I was informed by Mr. L. that it was almost time for me to go
                  on.
               I suppose he saw the perturbed state of my mind, and taking me to one
                  of the side wings, said, "Now, just look upon the audience as so many cabbage
                  heads,"-this I didn't think very complimentary-"and keep your eye upon the middle
                  chandelier, and it'll be all right." Miss Melton and a Mr. Denison preceded me,
                  and upon a signal from the manager, on I went, not having any distinct idea where
                  I was, and my head going round like a tetotum. When I arrived at the theatre, two
                  hours previous, my shirt collar stood up stiff, touching my ears, but had receded
                  to parts unknown long before I faced the footlights. The orchestra commenced a few
                  bars of symphony (sympathy rather), introducing the aria, "The Light of other
                  Days," and knowing the song well, I was easy on the score of properly commencing.
                  I "got through" the first verse, and was applauded-through the second, and
                  received a hearty "encore," and when with trembling legs and perspiring face I
                  managed to gain the prompter's desk, I was immediately told to "Go on again;"
                  Latham remarking, "I told you so." "See how they like you," &c. The song was
                  repeated, as was also the next I sang; and when my task was ended, I made for my
                  lodgings as quickly as possible, and felt that certainly one of the
                  great events of my life had happened.
               Singing a song upon the stage is one thing, speaking is another; and I was not
                  destined long to enjoy this simple duty. The play of Rob Roy was put up in the
                  little glass case in the green-room, and I was cast for McStuart; and
                  though it was a week before the play was to be produced, my nervousness was great,
                  and I flew to the room of the stage manager, Mr. Henry Tuthill (now, I believe,
                  the proprietor of the Royal Hotel, in Dublin), who was extremely kind to me, and
                  looked upon me as a sort of proteg, begging him to let me have, as quickly as
                  possible, the book from which I could write out my part. Forty lines, I believe,
                  is a "length," in theatrical parlance; and though there cannot be over a quarter
                  of that number devoted to the important part of McStuart, I was at work at it for
                  six days and nights, lying in bed, with candles on each side of me, vainly
                  endeavoring to get it into my head.
               Every rehearsal frightened me to death, and at the last, a sort of "dress" one, I
                  couldn't remember a line, my nervousness being so great, that I had
                  (notwithstanding the bullying of my tyrannical manager) to read it from the
                  book.
               The night arrived, and I had been carefully and indeed gorgeously attired for the
                  dread occasion by my kind friend and patron, Harry T-; and when I retired to the
                  greenroom, to look at myself in a very dirty and not very large glass, I thought I
                  resembled more one of the bagpipe men that I had often seen in the streets of
                  London than anything else. I wore a large sword, which kept perpetually getting
                  between my legs and tripping me up, and my naked legs, exposed for the first time
                  to the gaze of the public, seemed to shrink from the ordeal; and though I was
                  generally considered to be pretty straight on the pins, there appeared a feeling of sympathy between my knees,
                  for they kept up a continual though slight communication with each other in the
                  shape of knockings, all very well and friendly when I was by myself, but which (it
                  seemed to me, having a quick eye for the ludicrous) from the front would look
                  highly ridiculous.
               At length the fatal time arrived, and we were, in theatrical parlance,
                  "discovered," and I had to speak the first words. Never
                  shall I forget them. They were these:-"Well, well; I can drink my quart of
                  usquebaugh or brandy with any man; but we have work just now, and I had better
                  look to it." Like all stage novices, I spoke in a low key, as if addressing some
                  one in ordinary conversation in a room, and was gently (?) reminded of my defect
                  by my sweet-mouthed manager (who was the Major Galbraith of the evening) with a
                  fearful oath, "--! Why don't you speak out, you --?" which had the effect of
                  frightening the remaining part entirely out of my head, and I (in a stage whisper)
                  quickly replied, "he could speak the rest himself," for I knew nothing, and it was
                  only when Mr. Bailie Nicol Jarvie came after me with a red-hot (stage) poker
                  (which was precisely as lurid and glaring at the end of the performance as it was
                  when first handled by the infuriated Scotchman), that the words of my part came to
                  me, "Faugh, man, the next time you fight, fight like, a man, and not like a wild
                  Indian. My bonnie pladdie smells like a singed sheep's head."
               How the rest of the play went on, I have forgotten, excepting that when I should
                  have appeared at the "O. P." or "P. O." side with a company of soldiers to prevent
                  Rob Roy from running off the stage and bumping his head against a brick wall,
                  I-was snug in bed, with the inward conviction that I had not only made a great
                  judy of myself, but that another of the "momentous crises" of my life had been
                  passed.
               About three weeks after this occurrence, the Seguin troupe were announced, the
                  opening opera being Sonnambula, in which I figured as one of the male peasants, my
                  duties being simply to come on and go off with one of the female ditto, joining in
                  the chorus loud or soft as the case might be.

               Fra Diavolo was underlined, and I was cast for Matteo, the innkeeper.
                  Now this greatly perplexed me, for I found out that, though it seemed at first a
                  very easy and subordinate part, it was, musically considered, most important, and
                  as only two days were devoted to "getting it up," I politely but resolutely
                  declined doing it; Mr. Seguin telling the manager that it was too much to expect a
                  novice like myself, in so short a time, to learn the concerted music. The part was
                  accordingly "read" by a Mr. Byrne. I found out that the promises made me by
                  Manager Latham of instruction, dramatic and musical, amounted to nothing, and that
                  I had no one to look up to or to depend upon but myself; and I accordingly acted
                  as philosophically as possible, endeavoring to perform the parts allotted to me to
                  the best of my ability.
               About this time, a tragedian, by the name of Butler, made his appearance, his
                  opening play being the Avenger. I was cast for Conradin (the part played by the
                  pretty Mrs. Powell at the Park Theatre).
               The play was first read in the green-room, and my friend Tuthill told me I had a
                  beautiful part, and could make a hit in it if I was careful. It was certainly the
                  longest I had yet studied.
               In one of the scenes I had to make love (for the first time) to one of the ladies
                  of the play (I think it was Miss Charlotte Barnes, now Mrs. Gr. Comer), and at
                  rehearsal was told by the stage manager to kneel on my left knee, or the one
                  nearest the audience; but at the proper time and place, I was so agitated and
                  nervous, that I bent one and then the other, to the great annoyance of the lady
                  and the laughter of the audience.
               The plot of the play I know nothing of; all I remember is, that the lady and her
                  mother were friends of the Austrians, and that I (being the valet of the Avenger)
                  addressing the younger of the two females, had to say:-"I heard you this moment
                  own yourselves friends of the Austrians, and that name alone, but breathed in this
                  place, would call the walls down on you. 'Tis the Avenger's house!"
               With this announcement, both ladies gave a loud shriek, when I, taking the hand of
                  the youngest, replied-
               "I'll quickly find occasion to release you hence."
               
               The old lady-
               "Oh! with what can we reward you?"
               I replied-
               "'Tis my reward to serve this bright perfection; to gaze e'en thus a moment on her
                  looks; and if I merit guerdon beyond this, let me, but on my bended (here I kept
                  bobbing up and down) knee, press this hand once to my lips, with a devotion as
                  pure and holy as that you breathe in worship at your saint's shrine!" Oh lord! oh
                  lord!
               I managed to get this off so well that I received a round of applause, which so
                  frightened me that I forgot my part, and remained speechless on both knees,
                  kissing the lady's hand, she saying-
               "Ask not for more"-I thought of Oliver Twist, and wished myself at the devil.
               "Do get up," whispered the lady. "I can't," said I. "Do go, you're keeping the
                  stage waiting." "But I must go," called out the prompter. "I wish I could,"
                  thought I. "Go off the stage, sir," cried out Mr. Butler, who wanted to come on.
                  I, still kneeling, and perspiring from head to foot, at last caught the words,
                  "But I must go, for Walden will be here; and if but once suspected, you are lost!"
                  I received a general bullying when I got off the stage, and became more and more
                  disgusted with lengthy parts.
               The play of the Lady of Lyons was performed one night to a six dollar
                  house-cash. I was one of the three distinguished officers who come on in the fifth
                  act and talk about the gallant Col. Morier. I wore a cap, blue frock coat, red
                  sash, and carried a sword, so that I resembled one of our N. Y. policemen. Upon
                  the present occasion I had what they called, "doubled;" that is played two
                  parts-having in the earlier part of the drama enacted "Gaspard;" the consequence
                  was that I got the parts all mixed up, and began talking of-
               "Blows to a French citizen" to the utter confusion of my brother officers, who, in
                  a sotto voce tone, suggested that I should "clear out," which advice I instantly
                  took-marching off, as if on the most important business. I wasn't visible again
                  that night.
               The play of Hamlet afforded me the opportunity of appearing in the arduous rle of
                  "Gueldencrantz," or "Rozenstern," I forget which, for they are both about the
                  same.
               I remember the "business" was somewhat particular, and I was requested to be on
                  the "right" side of Hamlet (knowing the Tragedian pretty well I
                  thought this would be an easy matter). This of course I didn't do and the whole
                  scene went wrong, and when "Hamlet," after inviting me to play an air on the
                  flute, and my respectfully replying-
               "My Lord, I cannot"-
               Threw away the instrument-whether purposely or not I couldn't find out, as it
                  caught me on one of my legs and I "hollered" right out, and rushed off the stage
                  the audience roaring with laughter.
               
                   
               
               Upon another occasion, I was cast for the part of the "Duke of Buckingham" in
                  Henry the Sixth. I think my turn comes after "Hotspur's" celebrated speech,
                  commencing,-"My liege, I did deny no prisoners" (this part, I may mention, was
                  very effectively rendered by the celebrated brated scenepainter, Mr. Henry Isherwood); well, the language I found very
                  difficult, so much so, that I had taken the precaution to write it out in a bold
                  hand and stick it inside of my hat, and was in the act of reading it, when King
                  Henry the Sixth seeing what I was doing, said to me with an oath:-"Haven't you had
                  plenty of time to learn your part, Sir, without reading it here?" which rebuke had
                  the effect, not only of rendering the Duke speechless, but causing an audible
                  "titter" among the lords and ladies of the "Court."
               The play of London Assurance was produced with great splendor. The cast, if I
                  remember right, was as follows:-Sir Harcourt, Mr. Harry Tuthill; Dazzle, Mr.
                  Charles Howard; Meddle, Mr. Latham; Lady Gay Spanker, Miss Melton; Charles
                  Conolly, Mr. Byrne; Pert, Mr. Henry; Dolly Spanker, Mr. Henry, and "Cool"
                  myself.
               I was told I acted in this very well, and, the play happening to run for several
                  nights, I felt quite easy in it.
               Mr. Hackett was announced as Falstaff and I was cast for Pistol, in the Merry
                  Wives of Windsor, carrying a sword that was twice as big as I was, and dressed in
                  the most ungainly suit imaginable. My crowning triumph, however, was reserved for
                  the occasion of Miss Charlotte Barnes's Benefit, when she asked me to play the
                  part of "Paris" in Romeo and Juliet. I was attired, by my good-natured patron,
                  Harry T., most gorgeously, and having very little to do in the earlier portions of
                  the tragedy, felt composed and tolerably at my ease. At rehearsal in the fencing
                  scene, knowing little or nothing of the mysteries of that gentlemanly art, I
                  suggested to Mr. Romeo (C. Howard), that he should let me off quickly and easily,
                  giving me one or two "stage" digs in the side and letting me drop.
               This he agreed to do. At length the time arrived when in front of the pasteboard
                  tomb of the "Capulets" he makes for his rival, Paris. We both struck an attitude,
                  I requesting him to stab me quickly; I fell, supposed to be dead, and as I lay,
                  the carpenter (as I found out afterwards), in one of the flies above me, let some
                  water drop in my eyes causing me to move my head. This made the audience laugh;
                  down came more water-drip, drip, drip-my head moving to the other side-audience
                  convulsed. Poor Howard could not imagine the cause, and, looking at his legs,
                  thought there might (as he afterwards said) be a hole in his tights. "What's the
                  matter?" he cried; nobody could tell, and the curtain came down amid the
                  boisterous laughter of the audience. After it was over I explained what I supposed
                  to be the cause, and the carpenter received a severe reprimand from the manager
                  and I a good blowing up from Mr. Romeo.
               During my residence in Charleston, happening to fall in love with a large pair of
                  dark eyes, I gave vent to my feelings in the words and music of a song-my maiden
                  effort, which I believe "still lives," and enjoys a fair share of public
                  favor.
               The song is called "When the Moon on the Lake is beaming," and the following are
                  the words:- 
                     
                        When the Moon on the lake is beaming,
                        And the night is calm and still,
                        And the stars in their bright light gleaming,
                        Shine forth on some distant hill-
                        Wilt thou come, love, come?
                        Oh, come with me,
                        And I'll give thee a happy home,
                        Where a true heart waits for thee!
                     
                     
                        When the vesper bells are ringing
                        Their evening melody,
                        Our maidens sweet are singing
                        Their simple minstrelsy-
                        Wilt thou come, love, come?
                        Oh, come with me,
                        And I'll give thee a happy home,
                        Where a true heart waits for thee!
                     
                  
               
               Upon my arrival in New York, I took the song to Mr. William Dubois in Broadway,
                  who gave me the magnificent sum of five dollars, cash, for it and fifty copies,
                  which were distributed among my friends. The song has gone through several
                  editions, and is now published by William Hall & Sons, Broadway.
               A circumstance occurred one night after the performances were all over, as I was
                  returning home, that again changed the current of my life.
               
               I was accosted by a gentleman, who, with extended hand and pleasant voice,
                  said-
               "I think, sir, your name is M--, is it not? for I believe I made a voyage from
                  England with a brother of yours, in the 'Vibilea' some years ago?"
               I replied that I was delighted to have had the pleasure of meeting him, and
                  accepted his kind invitation to dine with him on the following day.
               This resulted in my being introduced to Col. Keith and my being once again
                  installed at the desk, and for several months I was one of the clerks in the
                  Secretary of State's office, in the old iron building near Broad street, in the
                  Palmetto city.
               I may mention here that though my stipulated salary with Harry Latham was six
                  dollars a week, board included, all I received from the treasurer for my
                  magnificent performances during my entire theatrical career in Charleston, was
                     two dollars and a half!
               
               The intense heat and a slight touch of yellow fever, determined me to take passage
                  to New York, in the ship Catharine, Captain Berry.
               Here I was one night, at a party at Dr. Levitt's, the dentist (who then lived on
                  the corner of Warren street and Broadway), introduced to Mr. William Mitchell,
                  then the manager of the Olympic Theatre, which was located where the City Assembly
                  Rooms now are.
            
            
               XI.
               THE OLD OLYMPIC.
               SOME delightful evenings were passed in the doctor's pleasant rooms, and he being
                  very musical and at the same time theatrically inclined, was constantly
                  entertaining at his hospitable apartments members of the profession, musicians,
                  artists, editors, etc. Horncastle, Mitchell, Bengough, Geo. Loder, Henry Watson,
                  and others were among his frequent visitors.

               The opera of "Amilie," George Loder suggested, should be brought out at the little
                  Olympic, and he told Mitchell that I was the proper person to personate the
                  Count.
               I at first could not entertain the idea at all, my career at Charleston upon the
                  stage haying been anything but pleasant; I intended to return, if possible, to
                  some private employment.
               In this I did not succeed, and accordingly, at the urgent solicitation of many, I
                  accepted the offer of Mr. Manager Mitchell, who christened me Mr. Raymond.
                  Accordingly, on October 2d, 1842, the first night of "Amilie" was announced at the
                  Olympic.
               The cast was as follows: 
                     AMILIE, Mrs. Timm.
                     JOS. SPECKBACKER, Miss Mary Taylor.
                     GEN. COUNT VAN DER TIEMER, Mr. Raymond.
                  
               
               Mr. Ben Baker, now attached to Laura Keene's Theatre, was the efficient prompter,
                  and I may here add that he not only "rang up" the first curtain upon
                  the occasion of the opening night, but he rang down the last.
               If I had gone through the ordeal of a first appearance-as I
                  unquestionably had at Charleston-it went for nothing; the to me terrible fact of
                  appearing in New York city, where, I felt, almost everybody knew me, I never
                  properly realized until the fatal day arrived.
               We had many rehearsals; and as to the music, I felt unconcerned. My "make up" was
                  quite attractive. A blue frock coat, lined with white satin, was faultlessly made
                  by Pearson, the tailor, the foraging cap by Mealio, the hatter (still to be found
                  on the corner of Canal street and Broadway), my patent-leathers (how they
                     did hurt my feet) by a distinguished Dutchman, and my red
                  trowsers, with gold lace, by the aforesaid tailor; the whole surmounted by a pair
                  of gorgeous epaulets, lent to me by my friend Captain McArdle.
               My manager found me at Windust's, in Park Row, about half-past two, eating minced
                  veal, I having heard that chopped meat was the right thing to "do" on this
                  thrilling occasion-thus preventing the possibility of anything "sticking" in my throat; a something I
                  fully expected would happen on the stage.
               As the hour drew near I experienced for the second time the fearful
                  sensation of making a first appearance. The night I remember well-it
                  was damp, misty, and foggy-and as I approached the front of the theatre a crowd
                  besieged the doors, the pit entrance being completely blocked up by market boys,
                  butcher boys, newsboys, big boys, small boys, of every age, shape, and size.
               The stage entrance was through a cellar-way in Broadway, the narrow and gloomy
                  passage slightly illuminated by one or two jets of gas, which "Tom the Gasman"
                  (quite a character in those days, and one of the "institutions") had a few moments
                  before lighted.
               The dressing-room appointed for me was about the size of an old-fashioned
                  shower-bath, having just room enough for me to stand up and sit down in, and the
                  perfume I encountered as I opened the rickety door, with its rusty iron latch, was
                  highly suggestive of the sick-ward in a hospital, or a half-cleaned pigstye.
               The wooden walls were covered with caricatures in chalk, old playbills, and from
                  long tenpenny nails hung remnants of tights, old hats, waistcoats, etc.; upon the
                  half dusted bench upon which my stage traps were supposed to be placed was a paper
                  of rouge, a pink saucer, some India ink, and a broken looking-glass.
               In my excitement I had forgotten, as I was informed, a very essential article. I
                  had been instructed in the art of "making up" my face, that is, the method of
                  putting on the rouge with a hare's foot-this latter thing I had lost
                  sight of. I accordingly told the dresser, a good-natured darkey, to go as quickly
                  as he could to the market near Grand street, and get me a defunct rabbit, and to
                  cut off his fore or hind leg and bring it to me immediately.
               I could not help smiling as he produced the leg of the animal, that had been
                  chopped off, and threw the remaining portion on the dressing-table. I commenced
                  bedaubing my face with the red powder, and (not being able in those days to sport
                  any real hair) with the India ink I painted a moustache on my upper lip.
               Taking a farewell look in the glass I proceeded to the "Greenroom," awaiting the
                  dread word of the "call boy," "Count wanted."
               The house was packed to suffocation, and everyone seemed on the tiptoe of
                  excitement. It was the first attempt to produce a legitimate and entire opera at
                  this little bandbox of a theatre, which, up to this time, had been celebrated for
                  its burlesques, funny farces, and, indeed, turning everything into ridicule.
               The overture was finished, capitally played by the compact little orchestra, and
                  when I mention among those composing its members such names as John A. Kyle,
                  George Loder, George Bristow, Henry C. Timm, and Aupick, the reader can well
                  understand its excellence.
               The curtain was rung up, and the opening chorus, with the song of Amilie, was
                  admirably given and vociferously cheered.
               I believe I was supposed to be a general in the Austrian army, returned after many
                  years' absence to the scenes of my youth.
               The stage was cleared, a canvas inn erected, with a paper window and a swinging
                  sign, upon which Mr. Bengough had painted: "The only Inn on the Horse-road to
                  Durich."
               I was pretty cool, though I felt I had a fearful ordeal to go through; the "wings"
                  on each side of the stage were crowded with the various performers, ballet-girls,
                  supernumeraries, and a few privileged persons who had the entre behind the scenes,
                  and Mitchell, who was to give me the word, when to "come on."
               A few bars of symphony, introducing the song of "My Boyhood's Home," was the cue
                  for me to appear-and on I walked, looking stiff, feeling stiff, and acting
                  "stiffer."
               My red trowsers, thank Providence, hid the shakiness of my legs, and, as my fright
                  did not particularly affect my voice, and I knew the song perfectly, I got through
                  it so as to be encored; and I imagined as I sat down at the table, and took up an
                  empty tin can that was (supposed to be) fall of wine, I was a veritable soldier,
                  and had returned to "my native heath," after a series of hardships and
                  mishaps.
               The opera was a great success, and Miss Mary Taylor, Miss Singleton, and Mrs.
                  Timm, were enthusiastically received;
                  indeed, the opera ran some thirty consecutive nights, and the boxes of the Olympic
                  were nightly filled with the lite of the city. Many funny scenes occurred during
                  the brief period of my stay as a member of the Olympic Company, and I shall
                  content myself, by jotting down from my memory, one or two incidents that may
                  amuse the reader.
               Upon one occasion my red trowsers, in which I played the Count, had been borrowed
                  by one of the lady members of the company who happened to be a very large woman,
                  and having to be emphatically "let out" in a region not necessary to mention, were
                  entirely spoiled for me. The opera being suddenly "put up," and I forgetting that
                  I had loaned my pants, was at the last moment constrained to borrow a pair of thin
                     white ones very badly made; the night was intensely cold, and I
                  was shivering, added to all this, my nether appendages were so tight a fit, that
                  every motion of my legs could be easily seen-it was useless for me to try to stand
                  still-my teeth chattered, my legs shook; how I got through the music I know not;
                  but I do know, that after that night I never allowed any woman to "let out" or
                  "take in" my trowsers.
               Charles Dickens came to see one of his pieces performed one evening; a private box
                  having been set apart, for himself and wife, by Mr. Mitchell. All eyes were turned
                  to the box, and little attention seemed to be given by the actors or the audience
                  to the performances. He dropped into the Green-room during the performance, and
                  was for some minutes chatting with Mr. Mitchell in his dressing-room.
               
                   
               
            
            

               XII.
               ALL ABOUT A CALF'S HEAD.
               AN incident occurred on the night of my benefit, which at the time created a
                  little excitement: the "Sunday papers," I remember, being particularly eloquent
                  upon the subject, each giving a very graphic, and (of course) different version of
                  the affair.
               Now, it must be remembered, that that part of the house known as the "pit" was
                  usually occupied by a crowd of butcher-boys, market, and newsboys, whose great
                  delight consisted, upon the occasion of any one's benefit, in throwing upon the
                  stage some friendly recognition of their appreciation of the efforts of their
                  favorite-these delicate attentions consisted, in part, of articles from the
                  greengrocer's, the tallow-chandler's, or the butcher's, such as wreaths of onions,
                  large-sized carrots, with turnips to match, a string of tallow-candles, and
                  occasional "red-herring," and in one instance an immense cod-fish.
               It was reserved for me, however, to have the finishing touch put to my theatrical
                  career, in the shape of a delicate souvenir from a friendly butcher-boy, who, if
                  he ever happens to read these lines, will remember the awful consternation, and
                  the shrieks of laughter, the audience was thrown into by the appearance on the
                  stage of his considerate and friendly memento.
               I had selected the first act of the Sonnambula for my benefit, introducing the
                  well-known air, "As I view now."
               Mary Taylor was the Amina, and Mr. Charles "Walcot the Elvino, who sang the music
                  charmingly.
               I was got up regardless of expense, had just crossed the bridge at the back of the
                  stage, and was walking down the middle thereof, the villagers standing bowing on
                  each side of me, when, just as I commenced the words, "As I view now!"-whack came
                  down a "calf's head," white as milk, beautifully clean-shaved, tied with blue
                  ribbons, and a fine large lemon in its mouth!
               I stepped back aghast, but perfectly resigned; the utmost confusion prevailed, some ladies laughing, others
                  crying. Mitchell (who had been in the orchestra, watching the progress of the
                  opera) jumped into the pit, and endeavored to lay hold of the "disturber of the
                  peace." Officers were flying about, and the whole house in a perfect uproar.
                  Walcot kindly suggested to me to "keep cool," and he would "pick it up." I stood
                  till I thought I must look very foolish, and walking up to the "dead head," took
                  hold of the blue silk with which it was bandaged, when, to my horror, it again
                  dropped; this disconcerted me, and I stepped back to await the result of the
                  disturbance.
               Elvino, at this moment, took compassion upon me, and carried the "head" off, and
                  presented it to the call-boy, who had some first-rate soup made of it, of which we
                  all partook on the following day-not an act of soup-ererogation, but in grateful
                  remembrance of the liberal donor.
               I was "called out," as was the usual custom, at the end of the performance, but
                  had left for home long before that time.
               Mr. Mitchell appeared before the curtain, stating, in a sharp and even indignant
                  manner, to the audience, that, "Mr. Raymond had retired for the night, but had
                  requested him (Mr. Mitchell) to present his compliments to the gentleman who had
                  thrown him his likeness."
               At this the audience collapsed in an extraordinary state of ironical laughter, and
                  Mitchell, perceiving the ambiguity of his remark, left the stage in high dudgeon,
                  the boys in the pit following with hoots of laughter.
               It may be well here to remark, that the audience usually attending the Olympic was
                  composed of, two classes: the boxes containing the first people in the city-as
                  frequently the body of the first tier would be occupied by a party of ladies and
                  gentlemen made up for the occasion-while the pit possessed the usual
                  characteristics of the galleries in a London theatre, and was always composed of
                  the same materials, the butcher-boys usually predominating.
               Mitchell had so used his audience to jokes and double entendre, that they were
                  always looking out for such things; he frequently having confidential
                  conversations with the pit, in regard to their conduct, during the progress of the
                  play; so that the manager and the audience generally, felt on terms of quite
                  friendly intercourse at all times.
               It will thus be seen, when Mitchell made this mistake, that the pit took advantage
                  of it, and returned his attempt at rebuke with shouts of laughter.
               When this was reported in the papers, I thought it somewhat equivocal, and to this
                  day I cannot find out whether he intended the compliment for me or my unknown
                  friend.
            
            
               XIII.
               YANKEE HILL.
               DURING my stay at the Olympic, I had been introduced to Mr. George H. Hill,
                  commonly known as Yankee Hill. Upon the close of the season, he suggested to me
                  the propriety of accompanying him on a lecturing and musical tour through the
                  Eastern States, commencing in Boston, and he offered me $10 a week and my
                  travelling expenses.
               We had rare fun together, and passed through many funny scenes. He announced me in
                  the bills as "Mr. Raymond, the celebrated London Vocalist."
               He gave his first entertainment la Dr. Valentine at the Melodeon, I assisting by
                  singing two or three ballads.
               Signor De Begnis, quite a celebrity in those days, gave a concert, and with Mr.
                  Hill's permission I sang for the first time in public my own song,
                     "When the Moon on the Lake."
               Yankee Hill was an inveterate joker, and very fond of playing his tricks upon
                  strangers. Upon the steamer in which we had taken passage for Boston, we noticed
                  several clergymen, going, I believe, to some religious convention. Hill picking
                  out one of the most sanctimonious-looking, said to me, "What do you bet I don't go
                  and ask that man for a pinch of snuff, and how his mother is?'" I replied, I
                  didn't think he could do it and keep his face straight. With this, I went to the
                  other side of the boat, so that I could see and not be noticed, when Hill, putting
                  on a very long face and throwing his head back, came softly behind the reverend gentleman, giving a tremendous sneeze
                  that made him jump several feet; Hill remarking that he hoped he had not alarmed
                  him, but the fact was he had a very bad cold, and his only remedy was a pinch of
                  snuff, and he had left his box at home; following it up with the promised
                  question, "Could you give me a pinch?" The clergyman replied, that he thought it a
                  sin to use tobacco in any shape; that he had religiously obeyed the injunctions of
                  his father and mother,-when Mill, interrupting him, said, "Wasn't your mother from
                  Plymouth, and her name-Benson?" (This was a favorite name of his.) "No, sir; my
                  mother, who, thank God, is still living, resides in Vermeount, and she is a
                  Snodgrass, sir!" "A-what-grass, sir?" says Hill. "I am, as you see, a little
                     deef, owing to this infernal-I beg pardon-troublesome cold; but I
                  had an aunt Snodgrass, sir, on my mother's side, and I did think I saw a
                     re-semblance; was your mother's name Mary?"-(Hill
                  always insisted that was a safe question.)-"It were sir," replied the
                  clergyman; when to my horror, and to the explosion of half a dozen bystanders into
                  a perfect tornado of laughter, Hill followed it up with the most imperturbable
                  gravity-"and how is your mother?" his face assuming an inquiring and
                  sympathetic expression. I could stand it no longer, and asked him not to repeat
                  the joke on anyone else.
               It soon became known that Yankee Hill was on board, and everybody was on his
                  guard, fearing to come in contact with him.
               We gave entertainments together at Portland, Augusta, Belfast, and other towns in
                  Maine, generally in the dining-rooms of the different taverns at which we
                  stopped.
               In the town of Augusta, where we stayed some two or three days, and where I was
                  much interested in passing several hours in the Insane Asylum, not as an inmate,
                  but as a visitor. At Augusta we were advertised-or rather it was "Yankee Hill's
                  Budget of Fun and Comic Olio"-to give a "show" on Saturday night; tickets
                  twenty-five cents.
               The hall was the eating-room of the hotel, a screen with a sheet thrown over it
                  separating us from the view of the audience. We had been out fishing in the
                  earlier part of the day and were both dreadfully burnt, so much so, that we had
                  been advised by our landlady to "grease" our faces before the concert came
                  off.
               Supper being over, and the hour of commencing near, Hill suggested to me to go and
                  "play 'em in." I replied, that I knew no pieces, other than a few accompaniments
                  to my songs, and I was not a piano-forte player (we had discharged our
                  accompanyist long before for want of funds and business). "Oh, no matter," said
                  Hill, "go and give him a chord or so, thump on it, run up and down the keys,
                  anything to make a noise, and directly you see anybody come in, cut behind that
                  sheet, and I'll walk in as if I was one of the audience."
               I did as directed, and the result was one old woman appeared and a small boy. She
                  stood at the door several minutes insisting that she couldn't give over twelve and
                  a half cents for her son. I then left for the screen, and having made a hole with
                  my penknife in the sheet, counted, by the time Mr. Hill made his appearance on the
                  stand, just a dozen persons including the servants of the house, the proprietor
                  and proprietress. The proceeds of the night amounted to thirty-seven and a half
                  cents.
               Hill commenced by saying, "Ladies and Gentlemen (Hill very red in the face, and
                  nearly bursting with suppressed laughter, and I behind the sheet joining in), I
                  presume it is-owing to the excessive-cold-no-heat-of the day-that-that-there are
                  so many-I mean-few-here to-night;-but the fact is-it is almost impossible to-er-go
                  through a laborious entertainment like mine, when the audience is so sparse, and
                  therefore, I'll give you one or two imitations, and Mr. Raymond will sing you one
                  or two songs, and as it's Saturday night, we'll conclude the whole with PRAYER! I
                  burst out laughing, the screen fell down, Hill couldn't keep his face, and the
                  audience joined in too; the consequence was, that a song from me, and a Yankee
                  story from Hill, completed the night's performance, and the thirty-seven and a
                  half cents were invested in some toddies before we retired for the night.
               It was during a brief stay in Portland that I met a young man who informed me he
                  was very shortly going to Italy, upon a visit to some relations; but for the sake
                  of the voyage, he intended to take
                  passage in a vessel which in a few days would sail for Malta and Smyrna, and he
                  wished me very much to try and arrange my affairs so as to make the trip with
                  him.
               I was always very fond of the sea, and the idea of making a summer voyage along
                  the classic shores of the Mediterranean was too great a temptation to be lightly
                  thought of, so I accordingly husbanded my resources, and bent all my energies to
                  the accomplishment of my wishes.
            
            
               XIV.
               SUMMER TRIP UP THE MEDITERRANEAN.
               IT was somewhere about the end of July, in the year 1843, that I found myself on
                  the deck of the barque "George Henry," Captain Michael Watson, bound for Malta and
                  Smyrna.
               Prior to leaving I had promisedmy friend, William T. Porter, Esq., then the Editor
                  of "The Spirit of the Times," whom I accidentally met at the "Tremont House," at a
                  quiet little "sit down," in company with Captain Ryrie, Henry Russell the
                  vocalist, John Olmstead, Jack Smith, Major Whitcomb, and the "Deacon," that I
                  would scribble an occasional letter for his journal.
               I had been christened by the Editor of the "Spirit" during my "Olympic" campaign
                  "Col. Pipes," one evening during a session of the "Barclay Street Guards," at a
                  locality known in those days as "Franks," and I thought it a good name to
                  perpetuate, accordingly my communications were signed, "Jeems Pipes," a few of
                  which I have preserved, and will now, with the reader's permission, herewith
                  introduce-
               
                  SOME "NOTES OF A VOYAGER," DURING A TRIP UP THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE SUMMER
                     OF 1843.
                  AFTER a delightful run of twenty days, we saw the land of Spain, about six
                     o'clock on the morning of the 18th of August, and shortly after came in sight
                     of Cape Trafalgar. We had a splendid view of the City of Tangiers on the
                     Moorish side, and the Island of Tarifa with its Lighthouse on the Spanish side.
                     I noticed several Feluccas; these boats sail remarkably well, I am told. They
                     have at Tarifa a celebrated "Gipsey Inn," about which there are many
                     extraordinary legends.
                  Feluccas laden with hides for Cadiz stop here in order to perform quarantine.
                     The island is charmingly situated, and is only fifteen miles from
                     Gibraltar.
                  We arrived in the Bay about one o'clock, and at three the Rock was in
                     sight.
                  The finest view you get is from the east side, where it rises perfectly
                     straight out of the water. On the extreme point of the rock, there seemed to
                     be, as I viewed it through the glass, an observatory or something of the kind.
                     We had a fine sight of the Road, and a fleet of vessels anchored there.
                  Hoisted the Ensign and Signal and passed the Rock, with fine strong breezes,
                     and clear weather, our beautiful barque going a good ten knots an hour, and lay
                     our course for Malta.
                  The weather at this season of the year, on the Mediterranean, is magnificent. I
                     had often read of the beauty of the sunsets, but must confess I
                     knew little of their grandeur until I had for myself gazed with wonder and
                     delight upon them. One evening in particular I shall never forget. The day had
                     been lovely, not too warm, and a clear blue Italian sky had stretched above us
                     since morning. At about six the whole western sky assumed a deep salmon color,
                     from which the sun, like a ball of fire, glared out, gradually but almost
                     imperceptibly approaching nearer and nearer the water's edge-a long, long range
                     of clouds of fleecy whiteness, appearing in the distance like some happy land
                     far away, spread itself a short space above the horizon.
                  The sun while slowly descending gilded the tops of these clouds, giving them
                     the appearance of long roads covered with golden sand. Then it just touched the
                     edge of the water sending forth a stream of yellow light upon the bosom of the
                     ocean-lower, lower, lower, until just for an instant it looks like a star on
                     the horizon, and is gone!
                  
                  For a few minutes the sky seems as brilliant as ever, when gradually the
                     dazzling colors die away, leaving a faint glow upon the clouds, but now so
                     fairy-like and beautiful, marking where glory once had been. Never shall I
                     forget this sunset.
                  On the 1st of September came in sight of the Island of Galeta. As we neared the
                     Island of Goza, I could see several old ruins, monasteries, etc., and some one
                     or two small towns. The Island seemed barren-all rock, nothing green to relieve
                     the eye. Commona is the next Island, next came Malta. Some two miles from this
                     place, we were beset by about twenty boats, filled with the most extraordinary
                     looking fellows, jabbering away in the funniest manner possible.
                        "Capteen, Capteen, twelve dollare, only twelve
                     dollare-twenty boats goot one's-small vessels pay twelve dollare
                        capteen!" It seems they wished to pilot us in, all vessels
                     entering the Port of Malta have to be towed in by these boats. They are
                        something in the shape of a canoe, and are propelled by some
                     four or five men, who stand and paddle precisely as an Indian would. Captain
                     Watson, who had been to Malta frequently, and knew well the imposing nature of
                     these "d-d scoundrels," as he called them, said, "No, no, I'll give you six
                     dollars and no more." "Oh," cried the foremost man, "Capteen, I'll
                     tell you, give nine dollare-all pay dat!" Away they kept yelling out, following
                     our vessel, until one of them cried, "Well, well, this time six dollare."
                     "Hoist away," sang out the Captain, and in a few minutes we soon hauled up into
                     the harbor.
                  We had to undergo the miseries of a fine day's quarantine-so we hoisted the
                     yellow flag, to prevent any boats coming near us, with the exception of the
                     "Spenditors." All shore boats are kept off, and the office boats on service,
                     and the pilot boats always keep on the weather side, at the regular
                     distance.
                  Immediately after our ship came to anchor, all the letters and papers, brought
                     by her, were sent to the Lazaretto for fumigation, and then forwarded to the
                     Post-office for delivery; All the ship's boats wear a yellow flag in the bow,
                     and they are not permitted to go to any part of the harbor, except to the
                     Parlatory at the Quarantine Office and at the Lazaretto, or to the
                     watering-place, after due permission-and to these places only during office
                     hours when the flag is flying.
                  The boats are always attended by a health guardian, and on no pretence are they
                     allowed to go alongside other vessels in quarantine. They do not allow even
                     sails to be used in boats. We soon saw one of the Spendit or boats making for
                     our barque, bringing all kinds of provisions-grapes and every variety of fruit.
                     In this harbor I had a good view of the town. There were several men-of-war
                     lying here. H. M. Frigate Belvidera, H. M. Brig Savage, and Frigate Tyne, also
                     the Queen, a 120-gun ship, (having the flag of Vice-Admiral Sir E. Rich. Owen,
                     K. C. B.,) also several French men-of-war steamers. The Maltese seem to be a
                     kind of mixture of the Chinese and Indian in their appearance,-their complexion
                     is of a copper-color, and their language, as I heard them bawling from the
                     quays, seems to be the most horrid jargon imaginable. The American Consul, Mr.
                     Andrews, paid us a visit, and informed us that we should obtain pratique the
                     following day. The next morning at about six o'clock, I went in the ship's boat
                     on shore, and met the Editor of the "Mediterranean Gazette," a gentleman to
                     whom I was introduced by our Captain. We went first to the Casino, and thence
                     to his house in the Strada Reale, where we breakfasted.
                  We then hired a caleche, and drove first to
                     the church of St. John's. There is nothing at all striking in the exterior of
                     this building. It appears built (I write from recollection) of a yellow kind of
                     stone, but the interior is magnificent. The church is not very large, but is
                     splendidly ornamented.
                  Then there are a great many interesting associations connected with it. Here
                     have reposed for many hundred years the bones of haughty knights and cardinals
                     of high order. I was shown by a man with shaved head, black surplice, beads and
                     cross to boot, all over the cathedral, and visited all the chapels. In one he
                     pointed out to me a magnificent silver gate, saved from the hands of the French
                     by being painted black, they, thinking it a wooden railing, passed it by; thus
                     leaving the most valuable relic behind. We next went into the vaults beneath to
                     see the tombs, our guide preceding us with a torch down many a well-worn
                        step, until we reached the iron
                     door leading to the abode of the dead. In his right hand was a bunch of large
                     rusty keys, and upon applying one to the huge door, it opened with a harsh
                     grating noise. The atmosphere was damp in the extreme. It was a long and rather
                     low arched vault, on each side of which were several marble tombs, carved most
                     beautifully, with the bodies of the knights in armor, cut out in marble, with
                     hands, as in the act of praying, resting on the breast; also cardinals
                     full-robed, chiselled out most exquisitely. At the further end of the vault
                     there was an altar with some long old iron candlesticks and black marble steps,
                     all dark with age, at which perhaps the very knights here entombed had often
                     knelt in prayer. A small dark-colored ivory crucifix hung from the wall, before
                     which our guide bowed very reverently. There is to me something awfully
                     imposing in the Catholic form of religion, and I lingered, looking at this
                     relic of by-gone days, until beekoned by my friend to proceed into the
                     cathedral. High mass was being performed. The altar is very grand, and is
                     adorned with golden candlesticks and magnificent paintings. The interior of
                     this church is very spacious and of great architectural beauty.
                  On one side of the altar is a throne for the Bishop, and on the opposite, one
                     for the Governor of Malta, with the royal arms over it. The pavement is richly
                     emblazoned with the armorial bearings of the knights in mosaic, most
                     beautifully blended, and under the arms are engraved long Latin inscriptions.
                     The walls are completely studded with tablets, busts, banners, & c., and
                     are carved in the most elaborate manner to the roof, pencilled with gold and
                     the richest colors imaginable. From the body of the cathedral, on each side,
                     are different chapels belonging to the different saints, all equally beautiful.
                     I stayed for hours admiring the many memorials here left of the Knights of St.
                     John and their companions.
                  I passed several old confessionals, where priests were occupied with many a
                     fair penitent. Service is carried on all day; and every day in the week, in and
                     out walk all sorts of people, rich and poor, noble and ignoble.
                  Dotted about here and there, I saw many an old friar, with shaved head, save a
                     rim round his forehead, with eyes and hands upraised, appearing at
                     least excessively devotional. So delighted was I with this place, that I
                     visited it several times during my stay. From hence we went to the Floriana
                     Gardens.
               
            
            
               XV.
               MALTA.
               THE Floriana Gardens are situated near the Regina Piazza, and are very
                  beautiful.
               Long grounds walled in with stone, having at each end flights of steps with high
                  iron gates. Almost every thing here is artificial, as very little grows in Malta,
                  the island being rocky and barren; but plants of every description, flowers of
                  various kinds, and trees of every name and height fill the air with all sorts of
                  delicious odors.
               Then there are long well-laid-out walks, shady groves, playful fountains, and
                  warbling birds.
               These gardens are frequented by numbers of persons; but all beggars, and the lower
                  orders of the female Maltese, are excluded.
               Methinks 't would be a sweet place to breathe a tale of love into the ear of some
                  fair one; for I find that here, as well as in Venice, "they do let heaven see the
                  pranks they dare not show their husbands." The streets of Malta are crowded with a
                  pale set of the most persecuting beggars, whose supplications for "Carita" are
                  annoying in the extreme. Sometimes they will even lay hold of your coat, and
                  follow you till you throw them a few coppers.
               The boats, which are very numerous, deserve particular attention. I had a better
                  opportunity of seeing these on shore than I had from the vessel. They are very
                  commodious, and are kept beautifully clean by the natives. The one I took was a
                  perfect little palace, painted with the gayest colors-a large eye adorning each
                  side of the stern-being provided with a white awning and a beautiful set of
                  curtains. The hire is very moderate-the boatman charging me two-pence English for
                  my ride.
               
               Towards evening I went into a saloon, No. 62 Strada Reale, where was a grand
                  "Cosmorama," comprising some of the most beautiful and interesting views taken
                  from nature that I had ever witnessed; a portion being views of Malta, then a
                  grand panoramic view of Constantinople, taken from the Russian Ambassador's
                  Palace, a very beautiful view of the Frozen Sea, and the grand chains of the
                  Caucasus Mountains.
               They were painted by a Signor Diamanti, and were superb. The price of admission
                  was only an English shilling. I and my friend then took a caleche, and had a
                  delightful ride from Valetta to the celebrated bay, where the apostle Paul is
                  supposed to have been shipwrecked. I returned about eight, when I took boat and
                  crossed over to Slema, a kind of watering-place, where the wealthier portion of
                  the Maltese usually spend their summer months. There was to be a grand display of
                  fire-works, it being the anniversary of some saint or other, and the company
                  assembled was numerous, but the fire-works were execrable, and would have been
                  hissed in any decent town in America. In Slema reside the Austrian, French,
                  Russian, American, add other consuls, the Admiral of the Port, etc. It is
                  beautifully situated on the sea shore, the Mediterranean washing its banks. The
                  weather at this time of the year is lovely, rainy very seldom-bright blue-skies,
                  and warm sun. The scene on Saturday evening was a novel one, at least for me. Here
                  then were hundreds of men, women and children jabbering away in different
                  languages, and at the top of their voices; some admiring the fire-works, some
                  yelling and hooting, others singing; then the band of the "Queen" just heard above
                  the riot, ladies innumerable walking to and fro, dressed in white, with black silk
                  hoods covering their heads and shoulders, resting on the arm of some baffy fellow,
                  or quietly seated on a projecting piece of rock, watching the gay scene. Then, a
                  turbaned Turk, with long beard and pipe in mouth, would pass me. Then some funny
                  looking fellow, dressed in black cloth, quakercut clothes, black silk stockings,
                  low shoes, and three-cornered hats-these I took to be some church worthies.
                  Spaniards, Italians, Turks, Greeks, Maltese, passed and repassed. We had the moon
                  high above us the pale and placid moon, while the myriad stars, that were
                  twinkling their silver eyes, as if in wonder at the scene beneath them, were
                  reflected in the clear water as in a mirror. It was a heavenly night! The bright
                  blue Mediterranean lay calm and still as ah infant slumbering; and Malta in the
                  distance, with its many turrets, towers and fortresses, formed altogether a most
                  lovely picture. I was wandering along alone, and had progressed sufficiently far
                  to be rid of the noise of the people, when I saw in the distance the figure of a
                  woman standing in front of a very recherch looking villa. As I approached she
                  slightly drew back, I turned round, she was still looking. I doffed my chapeau,
                  retraced my steps-spoke to her, and to my no small delight and astonishment, she
                  returned answer in English, with a very slight Spanish accent. I now had a good
                  opportunity of looking at her more particularly. She was about the middle height,
                  and though her features were good, her eyes black and piercing, and her hair also
                  dark, she was not exactly handsome. There were certain traces of care
                  and anxiety about the face, giving it a melancholy sadness of expression. She was
                  symmetrically formed, and had the prettiest foot and ankle imaginable. It was not
                  difficult to get her consent to walk, and we strolled therefore to the sea shore,
                  and having, after some trouble, found a very quiet little nook, where we might
                  remain free from intruders, we sat down, the waters of the Mediterranean rippling
                  at our feet. The place of our choice had evidently been appropriated by some
                  Sicilian fishermen to purposes of use, in keeping their nets, tackle, etc. In the
                  distance, we could see numbers of little feluccas, looking like birds on the
                  water; it was as light as day, and the sea sparkled like diamonds in the
                  moonlight. Well, it was not long ere I found out the history of my pretty
                  brunette. She had been married at the early age of fourteen to a man some thirty
                  years older than herself, for whom she had never entertained the slightest
                  affection, and also at the wish of an old father, who had been the army, whose
                  sole reason for insisting on the union was the immense wealth of the Spanish
                  suitor. Her mother had died in giving her birth, and she was therefore at an early
                  age left to the complete control and care of her father. She was a native of
                     Goza, the sister island of Malta, and
                  from her occasional intercourse with some of her father's friends had acquired a
                  knowledge of the English language. Her remaining parent had long since died, and
                  she had therefore no one left to her but her husband, whose harsh and cruel
                  treatment embittered every hour of her existence. It was painful in the extreme to
                  witness the deep-rooted sorrow of this poor girl, and the comparative resignation
                  with which she tried to bear up under her troubles. She had every luxury in
                  life-wanted for nothing, but there were no kindred spirits with whom her youthful
                  heart could sympathize. Love was congealed within her bosom, and it appeared to
                  her very strange that anybody could enter into the spirit of her thoughts, or
                  endeavor to relieve her mind from its present gloom. She had ever since her
                  marriage been kept so strictly, that, with one or two exceptions, she had never
                  seen a human face but her husband's, or the domestics of the house. Her husband
                  traded between the two islands, and had left early that morning, or this very
                  unlooked for and somewhat romantic meeting would not have taken place. Fancying
                  the lateness of the hour might excite suspicion in some of the inmates of her
                  dwelling, I proposed returning: she then asked me if I would accept the
                  hospitality of her household, as I had told her the vessel in which I intended to
                  sail for Smyrna would leave the following morning, and prevent me paying her
                  another visit. I thanked her, and gladly availed myself of her kind offer, and we
                  both strolled in the direction of her dwelling. The night was still, not the
                  slightest wind stirring, and no sound to be heard save our own feet crushing the
                  tiny shell of the beach as we walked along-then those lines of Lord Byron came
                  vividly to me- 
                     
                        "There is a dangerous stillness in that hour,
                        A stillness which leaves room for the full soul
                        To open all itself, without the power
                        Of calling wholly back its self-control.
                        The silver light, which, hallowing tree and bower,
                        Sheds beauty and deep softness, o'er the whole,
                        Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
                        A loving languor, which is not repose."
                     
                  
               
               
                  In time we reached the Villa; some Greek servants quickly brought me
                  some coffee and a pipe, which having enjoyed very much, I was shown to my chamber
                  by my interesting hostess. The room appointed for me was fitted up in the most
                  chaste and beautiful style imaginable; in the corner opposite the door was a
                     divan covered with a rich colored silk, about
                  two feet from the floor, over which hung the lightest network, to prevent any
                  annoyance from insects etc. The floor was inlaid with woods of different color,
                  and every variety of figure, and was as bright as the most polished mahogany. The
                  windows opened into a kind of Aviary of the most elegant trellis work; where birds
                  of every variety of plumage were quietly roosting. Numbers of beautiful flowers
                  adorned the lower parts of the windows, filling the room with delicious
                  fragrance.
               
                  
                     HUBBY
                  
               
               The scene from the window was lovely indeed; the bright moon creeping through the
                  thin lattice-work, danced in a thousand fantastic forms on the curiously carved
                  walls; occasionally through the open lattice, I could hear the gentle splash of
                  the muffled oar of a Gondolier, bringing upon the night breeze to my grateful ears
                  the warbling of sweet voices as it passed along-while as far as the eye could
                  reach stretched out before me the bright blue waters. I took a whiff or two more
                  at my pipe, and feeling somewhat drowsy,
                  sought my novel couch, and it was not long ere I was rambling in the land of
                  dreams.
               I had not been asleep, I should think, more than an hour, when I was suddenly
                  awakened by a loud knocking proceeding from the lower part of the. house. I
                  immediately jumped up, and, taking with me an unloaded pistol that I
                  found in the room, quietly opened the door and listened. Louder and louder the
                  knocking continued-bells were ringing in every direction-still all seemed quiet up
                  stairs. I crept to the top of the staircase, and could from my position
                     see everything without being seen.
               
               Two men servants were trying, as well as they could with their eyes only half
                  open, to unbar the door, in which they ultimately succeeded, when suddenly they
                  were knocked down by a tall brawny savage-looking Italian, who with eyes flashing
                  fire, cried out, "Perch Diavolo mi faceste aspettare tanto prima d'aprire," when
                  the foremost of the men replied "Dormivamo si profondamente, che non udimmo il
                  vostro picchiare, se non quando vennimo svegliati dal campanello di madama." The
                  Italian seemed a little more composed upon receiving the reply, and directing one
                  of them to unsaddle his horse, he gave to the other a small packet, at the same
                  time pointing up stairs in the direction of the lady's chamber. I remained
                  unobserved in my covert, until the man had descended, when it being somewhat dark,
                  and not having properly noted my own door, I unfortunately pounced in upon my
                  lady, startling her greatly. Of course I was greatly embarrassed, and was bowing
                  myself out in the best manner I could, when she motioned me to sit down, placing
                  her finger to her mouth for me to observe silence. This room exceeded by far in
                  beauty and elegance the one I had lately occupied; every ornament seemed-either of
                  silver or gold: delicious odors emanated from pastile burners of the most curious
                  workmanship, and in the further end of the apartment a very beautiful marble
                  fountain, some three or four feet in height, sent forth a bewitching little
                  Spanish melody. In about the middle of the apartment, on a small divan of the most
                  gorgeous colors, reclined the fair occupant of the chamber. Her black hair hung in
                  long flowing tresses over shoulders of the most perfect symmetry, her head being
                  lightly bound with a thin band of gold, from the centre of which glistened a large
                  diamond.
               In her hand was the letter brought by the Italian, over which she seemed to be
                  anxiously poring. She started up suddenly, saying, "he comes home early this
                  morning!" The letter was from her husband, and had been brought by one of his
                  servants; something unexpected had happened on the island, calling him immediately
                  home.
               I saw evidently my stay would now be short, and therefore with a sad, sad heart
                  prepared to take my leave. Who could have gazed on such a being of light and
                  loveliness as this-who had told me the secrets of her heart-without feeling a pang
                  at parting? I knew full well that that day would for ever end the
                  happy hours we had passed together-that thousands of miles of water would soon
                  roll between us! I cannot remember what took place-but never in the course of my
                  wanderings did I so bitterly regret the hour of parting. She watched at the
                  gateway, till the windings of the cliff prevented me seeing her more.
               I left the next day,-and in a few hours we were going a good ten knots in the
                  "George Henry," bound for Smyrna, Asia Minor.
            
            
               XVI.
               SMYRNA.
               ON the 10th of September we set sail, though not with a fair wind, for Smyrna. The
                  day was beautiful, and a few hours found us again, far out upon the sea. On the
                  morning of the 16th, after some days' calm, a fine breeze sprang up, about six
                  blowing a complete gale; we hauled in studding sails, furled mainsail and jib,
                  reefed topsails, etc. Blew a gale all night, smashing all the porter, ale, wine,
                  and brandy we had on board. About evening the peninsula of the Morea came in
                  sight.
               On the 20th we entered the Archipelago from the westward between Cerigo and the
                  Main; we seemed perfectly surrounded by
                  land, passed the islands of Santarin, Nauplio, Amargo, Inolo, Syphanto, Syra,
                  etc.
               Several of these we saw very plainly, and on the island of Thermia I could with
                  the glass count something like fifty or sixty windmills!
               We then passed the islands of Ipsara and Scio.
               Ipsara is celebrated as the birth-place of the Greek admiral, Canaris, the
                  commander of the Greek fireships. On the 25th we got through the straits between
                  Ipsara and Scio, although the winds were baffling; when well through, a fine
                  breeze caught us, carrying us up to Smyrna Bay, having our studding sails, and
                  every sail set that would draw.
               The first remarkable place in the last mentioned bay, which claimed my attention,
                  was a promontory called the "Iron Head."
               It is on these mountains, our Captain informed me, that the much sought for
                  Sultana raisins are cultivated. When we got abreast of these, we shaped our course
                  along the land-mountainous, and sprinkled with the most beautiful vineyards,
                  villas, etc., belonging to the wealthier portions of the Turks,-for another range
                  of mountains called the "Two Brothers," which appellation they have obtained from
                  the fact of their having two very conspicuous mounds rising higher than the rest,
                  and of precisely the same height.
               When close under these I had the first view of the beautiful country about
                  Smyrna.
               Smyrna is a city of the first rank in the Turkish Empire, and is the capital of
                  Asia Minor, and next to Constantinople, I believe, is the largest city in
                  Turkey.
               It is beautifully situated, along the margin of a large bay, under Mount Pagus;
                  and is the grand emporium of Levantine commerce.
               The population is estimated at about 150,000, consisting of a mixture of all
                  nations; Turks, Greeks, Jews, Armenians, Persians, Arabs, Franks, etc. The
                  approach to the town is beautiful with the numberless towering minarets-the white
                  domes of the mosques, the sombre-looking groves of cypress-trees, etc.
               But I found upon entering it, all its beauty vanished.

               We immediately obtained a pratique, having a "clean bill of health" from Malta,
                  and of course went on shore without any difficulty. The streets are dreadfully
                  dirty and ill-paved; hardly worth the name of alleys, and so narrow, that it would
                  not be very difficult to shake hands from opposite windows.
               I went immediately to a hotel, kept by an Italian, named Salvo Zara, where I was
                  introduced by the Captain to my future fellow-passenger, S--, with whom I dined
                  and passed the rest of the day.
               In the morning taking with me a guide-for it is quite impossible to find your way
                  alone in Smyrna, the innumerable twists and twinings, alleys, courts, and curious
                  windings, rendering it impracticable-we went through some of the bazaars, gazing
                  with delight and astonishment on the multitudes of men and women, with every
                  variety of dress and costume, that passed and repassed me; each seeming to speak
                  in a different tongue. Here came donkeys with huge saddles-then long trains of
                  camels with tinkling bells, carrying heavy loads of fruit.
               The house at which Lord Byron resided during his brief sojourn here was shown me
                  in the portion of the town known as the "Frank Quarter."
               The camel and dromedary are names given to two varieties of the same animal. The
                  principal and perhaps the only sensible difference by which these two races are
                  distinguished consists in this: that the camel has two humps upon his back,
                  whereas the dromedary has but one; the latter, also, is neither so large nor so
                  strong as the camel. This is the usually received opinion; but, according to some,
                  the difference between them is not that one has two humps on its back, and the
                  other only one; it is like the difference between a heavy cart horse and a swift
                  riding horse. The dromedary is much lighter, swifter, and quicker in its motions,
                  but the Arabian camel and dromedary have both only one hump, though the camels of
                  other regions are said to have two. Of the two varieties, the dromedary is by far
                  the most numerous, the camel being scarcely found except in Turkey and the
                  countries of the Levant, while the other is found spread all over the deserts of
                  Arabia, the southern parts of Africa, Persia, Tartary, and a great part of the
                     Eastern Indies. Thus, the one inhabits
                  an immense tract of country; the other, in comparison, is confined to a province:
                  the one inhabits the sultry countries of the torrid zone; the other delights in a
                  warm, but not a burning climate. They seem formed for those countries where shrubs
                  are plentiful and water scarce; where they can travel along the sandy desert
                  without being impeded by rivers, and find food at expected distances.
               The camel, I am told, travels several days without drinking. In the vast deserts,
                  where the earth is everywhere dry and sandy, where there are neither birds,
                  beasts, nor vegetables, where nothing is seen but heaps of stone, it travels,
                  posting forwards sometimes, I am informed, at the rate of twelve miles within the
                  hour, without requiring drink or pasture, and is often found to go six or seven
                  days without any sustenance whatever. The feet of this animal seem to be formed
                  for travelling on sand, and utterly unfit for moist or marshy places; the
                  inhabitants, therefore, find a most useful assistant in this animal, where no
                  other could subsist; and by its means cross the deserts with safety, which would
                  be impossible by any other mode of conveyance. Well does it merit the appellation
                  given to it, the "Desert Ship."
               I could not help noticing the great beauty of the Greek women; but, generally
                  speaking, their forms are bad, and their feet somewhat large. The style of cap
                  they wear is pretty; it is covered with gold or silver lace, their hair being
                  braided around it. The Armenian women are extremely beautiful and fair; they have
                  their own quarter of the town, and wear also a costume of their own. I went to see
                  them worship in one of their churches. The men and women were separated by
                  bars-kneeling and praying, thumping their foreheads pretty frequently. The women,
                  veiled in white, kissed the priest's hand-left the church-first putting on their
                  shoes. I then took a stroll into the Jewish quarter of the town, and was struck
                  with the handsome appearance of the men. Such magnificent heads! studies for an
                  artist!-large, high foreheads-aquiline nose-piercing black eye-swarthy complexion
                  and long grey beards. The other sects seem to hold them in derision, and heap upon
                  them all kinds of oppression and contumely.
               Some of the women are very beautiful; their dress is extremely picturesque-a
                  girdle of magnificent gold links twisted round the waist, a fillet of gold around
                  the head, and thick bracelets on the wrists all of the same material.
               Having brought with me a letter of introduction, from a gentleman in Boston, to
                  Mr. L--, an American merchant, who had resided many years in Smyrna, I called at
                  his office to present it, upon which he very politely invited me to spend a few
                  days with him at his country house in Boujah, a beautiful little village where the
                  American and English merchants usually spend their summer months. At about six,
                  Mr. L. and I started from our hotel. Two very comely-looking mules, with very
                  capacious saddles, were now brought to the door. "We mounted, followed by a little
                  Greek boy, whose province it was to drive the animal onward, by applying, and
                  pretty smartly, too, a thick stick to his back.
               Away we jolted through innumerable small streets, alleys, carts, and gateways, the
                  boy continually crying out, "Duerf duer!" which my friend told me, in
                  Yankee meant. "Go lang!"
               Having trotted pretty rapidly, we soon reached the Turkish burial-ground, about
                  which I will make but the briefest mention.
               Wending my way through intricate and curious alleyways, streets, and zigzag
                  windings, I suddenly came upon the burial-place of the dead. I was struck with the
                  solemn grandeur of the place. Thousands of majestic cypress trees waved around me;
                  the ground was literally covered with white marble tombs of all shapes and sizes,
                  curiously carved; the greater part having a turban cut in stone at the top. It was
                  getting quite dark, and we had progressed sufficiently far to be rid of the noise
                  in the city. Everything still as the hearts of those now lying beneath our
                  feet.
               I turned my mule's head towards the town to observe its appearance, when lighted
                  up-it happened to be the time of the Ramazan, or feasting month, and in the
                  evening all is hilarity and glee-hundreds of lights glistened brightly from the
                  tops of the different minarets, looking like crowns of variegated lamps suspended
                  in the air. So long as the sun is in the sky, the faithful abstain wholly from
                  eating, drinking ing, and sleeping; but
                  as soon as the sun goes down, all are cheerful, nay even boisterous. We rode along
                  until we came in sight of the summit of an old castle, standing near the site of
                  ancient Smyrna. These walls have remained something like 2200 years! The front of
                  the fortress was just visible, and part of the tower. The rising moon just tipped
                  its old walls with silver, rendering the view more imposing. We jogged along
                  slowly up, as I thought, a steep hill, when upon coming to the top, my companion
                  turned to me and said: "Now we are some 2000 feet above the level of the sea:" so
                  it seems we had been trudging up a mountain.
               We soon found ourselves nearing the little village of Boujah; two colored lamps
                  shone brightly from among the trees in the distance which our mules seemed to
                  understand, for they kept up a continual gallop until we came in sight of the
                  village.
               The road for about a quarter of a mile before you enter is pretty good. As soon as
                  we got within a stone's throw of the place, we were beset by a multitude of Greek
                  boys, wishing to take our mules. On each side of the road-a little wider than the
                  streets of the city-were small shops occupied by Greeks. Different colored lamps
                  lighted up each, and at the doors were seated groups of these handsome fellows
                  smoking long pipes, the comeliest women the sun ever shone upon, occasionally
                  bringing them their coffee in dapper little china cups with plated bowls.
               We left our mules at a little hotel, kept by the Italian of whom I have before
                  spoken, and at the suggestion of my friend L--, took a pedestrian trip over the
                  mountains. The night was lovely, indeed; and the view of the town of Smyrna, lit
                  up, as it was, by a thousand variegated lights, was magnificent.
               The sky studded with stars, a few faint clouds, slightly tinged with the hues of
                  evening, lingered on the horizon, like the last incense from some mighty altar.
                  The air was still, and breathing the odor of the wild jessamines and myrtle which
                  clothed the side of the mountain; all was richness, splendor, and repose.
               As the breeze came freshly up the mountain, our eyes roved over the glorious
                  scene; above, the silent and glittering ing stars; far below, the sweep of the
                  ocean, on which were the sails of many nations; even the deep murmur of the waves
                  came over our ears, mingled with the softer sounds of the pipe and tamborine, the
                  music of the hamlets.
               It was besides, as I said before, the night of the Ramazan; this, all the world
                  knows, is the only thing wanting to make a Turkish summer evening the perfection
                  of beauty. As I was standing, I heard the evening gun fire, and the whole famous
                  exhibition rapidly followed. Mosque after mosque blazed out in light as if it were
                  roofed with jewels. Towers, hitherto invisible, suddenly shot up, like fixed
                  flames, of all shapes, heights, and colors, all was glittering, glowing, and
                  magnificent. We then strolled in the direction of Mr. L-'s dwelling. The gate was
                  quickly opened by a pretty Greek girl, and we entered the grounds. The house
                  stands in about the centre of the garden, and is beautifully constructed; all the
                  rooms on the lower floor-there being no second story-and on each side, are large
                  and commodious wings for sleeping apartments.
               Mr. L. soon appeared. I was then introduced to his lady, a charming-looking Greek
                  woman, a native of Smyrna.
               I never can forget the kindness, hospitality, and attention deceived at the hands
                  of this excellent family; and it affords me infinite pleasure in being thus able
                  to record their kind-heartedness and liberality. The next day I had another view
                  of real Asiatic scenery. On the mountain elevation you have a most extended view
                  of the distant islands, the beautiful harbor, and the ocean. Herds of camels were
                  grazing quietly near me, attended by the handsomest looking shepherds
                  imaginable.
            
            
               
               XVII.
               CONSTANTINOPLE.
               HAVING received a polite invitation from Captain Paige, formerly of Augusta,
                  Maine, who I believe was the first to run a steamship on the Turkish waters, I
                  accompanied him in his snug little craft to the far-famed City of the Sultan. We
                  came to anchor in the Golden Horn about midnight. To the left we had just passed
                  the Seven Towers, peeping out above the dark walls; everything was still, no
                  rattling of carriages, no move of any kind. Here then burst upon my view the
                  far-famed city of the Sultan! The night was clear, and the silvery moon shone
                  brightly in the heavens. Groves upon groves of cypress trees followed each other
                  in quick succession; then the bold mountain scenery, surrounding it on the Turkish
                  as well as on the Asiatic side, giving to it a grandeur indescribable. Hundreds of
                  glittering minarets, towering, white and majestic, their spires tipped with
                  silver, and domes of gigantic mosques rose up before me.
               Then the seraglio and harem of the Sultan were pointed out to me, consisting of
                  palaces, rather modern than otherwise, and a very large range of rooms, looking
                  like the cells of a prison. The wall is yet remaining, and is three miles in
                  extent. This denotes the limit of the ancient city of Byzantium, called so when
                  occupied by the Romans, under Constantine the Great.
               The Ramazan was still kept up, and the sight of this immense city on a moonlight
                  night was very imposing.
               Thousands of variegated lamps, in the form of stars, and different kinds of
                  flowers, trembled in the air, and the cupolas of all the mosques, illuminated so
                  magnificently, that they seemed to spring from an ocean of variegated fire.
               My eyes drank in with enthusiasm the magic of the scene before me, and my dreams
                  that night were as fairy-like and lovely as the wondrous scenes I had that day
                  witnessed. The next morning I, with my friend Captain Paige, (the present
                  Commander of the "Marmora" Steamship,) went on shore early; the beautiful bay was
                  literally covered with caiques, darting like arrows every minute, filled with
                  veiled women and men of all nations. They are long narrow wherries, covered in the
                  most elegant manner, adorned with golden bronze; but are so lightly built as to be
                  in constant danger of upsetting, when you have to sit down at the bottom and
                  endeavor to preserve the necessary equilibrium, by inflexions of the body, either
                  to the right or left, as may be requisite from the motion of the waves.
               They have the most delicious divans, cushions, etc., on which to recline, and are
                  rowed by Turks dressed in the whitest linen, fitting close to the skin, having
                  full sleeves, full linen trowsers coming down to the knee, and on the head a red
                  cloth scull-cap, with long flowing silk tassel.
               It is estimated that there are over 90,000 of these fairy-like boats on the
                  Bosphorus. The hire is very reasonable, on account of their great number; you go a
                  considerable distance for one piastre, or about two cents.
               We went first to Pera, and put up at the Hotel de l'Europe, kept by an Italian. It
                  is an excellently conducted house, and I would advise all travellers to go there:
                  it is also exclusively the dwelling of the Franks.
               The Hotel is situated in a long avenue called the Corso of Pera, from the windows
                  of the front room of which may be witnessed many extraordinary sights, whilst the
                  view from the back presents one of the most magnificent panoramas in the world.
                  Underneath, to the left, stretches out before you the beautiful harbor of
                  Top-hana; to the right is Galeta, built, I believe, by the Genoese; still beyond,
                  the Golden Horn, upon whose waters many hundreds of colossal ships, from all parts
                  of the globe, are quietly resting. Passing them you will see numbers of little
                  gilt caiques cutting through the waves like dolphins.
               On the opposite shore lies Constantinople, with its pointed Seraglio Tower, its
                  beautiful cupolas, and its thousands of slim minarets peering upwards in the air.
                  Across the Bosphorus, in another Quarter of the world, yet hardly ten minutes'
                  trip, lies Scutari, with all its groves of cypresses. The mountain chains of Asia
                  are seen in the distance, and the beautiful "Prince Islands," raising their heads from the bosom of the Sea of
                  Marmora. Taking a walk through the bazaars, I saw a large crowd collected at the
                  corner of one of the streets, and upon inquiring of my companion, found out that
                  one of the celebrated "story tellers" of Constantinople was delighting his
                  numerous auditory with the recital of some extraordinary legend or other.
               The man was raised some feet above his listeners, and seated in the same manner a
                  tailor would be on his bench. The story seemed, from the great attention paid the
                  speaker, to be of a highly interesting nature, for at its conclusion the
                  astonishment of the multitude seemed great indeed. My friend translated to me, as
                  we stood and listened, the somewhat extraordinary legend of the old Turk.
               It was nearly in the following words:-
               "In the town of Rabdju there lived, some hundred years ago, a Greek fisherman, who
                  had amassed a goodly fortune by constantly trading in the islands of the
                  Archipelago and buying up the loveliest Circassian women for the harems of the
                  Sultan; he, besides this, owned more caiques than any other trader in the
                  province. He had been from his earliest youth passionately fond of music, and
                  having resided the former part of his life in some of the Neapolitan cities, had
                  acquired a considerable taste for the science, and on all occasions had been an
                  eager listener when anything musical was going on. He bought himself a guitar, and
                  to the study of his instrument he devoted all his leisure time. As he grew up, he
                  became more and more attached to his favorite amusement, and having amassed a very
                  snug fortune by his trafficking, he married, and retired to pass the remainder of
                  his days in the quiet little town of Rabdju, near the Gulf of Lepanto.
               "Here he had nothing to disturb him in his devotedness to his favorite pastime,
                  and as his children grew up their ears became familiar with the different Italian
                  airs he would be constantly playing to them. One air in particular seemed to charm
                  him above air others, and when, as the sun sank in the rosy west, and soft
                  twilight followed, the old Greek would wander forth with one or two of his
                  children to some favorite spot, and draw forth from his old rusty-looking
                  instrument the tones that pleased him so well in his boyhood hood, his eyes would
                  fill with tears, and for a time he seemed lost in thought.
               "The effect of the music seemed to enervate him so completely, that it was deemed
                  advisable to keep the guitar from his sight.
               "He lingered a few years, and died very suddenly at an advanced age, and at his
                  death it was found that he had locked up or hidden all his treasure, consisting of
                  gold, silver, and precious stones, in some place unknown to any of his wives or
                  children.
               "Great was the consternation, great was the disappointment and vexation of his
                  household; he not having left enough to pay the actual expenses of his burial.
               "At last the youngest boy bethought him of an experiment-he really believed he
                  could awaken his dead father!
               "Accordingly, he took down the old instrument that had been forgotten for so long
                  a time, and with streaming eyes commenced to sing and play over the body the air
                  which was the favorite of the old man when living. Hour after hour passed-still no
                  sign of recognition. But the little fellow continued, until, at last, watching
                  steadily, he fancied the slightest color possible tinged the cheek of the dead
                  man!
               "Was it imagination? No! The ghastly hue of death had left the face-the lips
                  quivered-the eyelids opened-the eye glared boldly around, and tears flowed in
                  streams down the old man's cheeks. Life had indeed returned; the object was
                  obtained. The old man lived sufficiently long to tell the hiding-place of his
                  wealth."
               Thus ended the tale of the "story teller" of Constantinople. Having brought
                  letters of introduction to an English gentleman, who had resided some thirty years
                  in Stamboul, and who offered me every kindness and attention, I had opportunities
                  of seeing a good deal of the city and its delightful environs, during the short
                  time I proposed staying; and I found in his son a very kind and gentlemanly
                  companion, who was by my side constantly, and with whom I made several delightful
                  excursions.
               Having expressed a great wish to make a trip to the "Sweet Waters," I, with my
                  friend, hired a caique, and comfortably reclining in the bottom of the boat on a
                     very agreeable divan, I watched the
                  magnificent landscapes that on all sides surrounded me. It is situated on the
                  snores of the Bosphorus, near an Asiatic castle, in a very beautiful meadow,
                  through which the river meanders. The Sultan has a country residence here, to
                  which he retires in the summer time. On arriving, the scene was novel,
                  picturesque, and beautiful.
               The meadows and hills shone in a fresh verdant dress, and through the tall
                  cypresses glittered the Sultan's splendid kiosk. Here were hundreds of Turkish men
                  and women seated together in picturesque groups upon the grassy carpet.
               We had taken with us some provisions, intending to remain one or two days, should
                  the wind or weather prove agreeable. We therefore unpacked our eatables, and
                  having drunk a little sherbet, left our caique, leaving the men to take care of
                  her till our return.
               The beautiful scenery surrounding me on all sides, I shall never forget. After a
                  long walk, we returned to our boat, intending to proceed still further up the
                  Bosphorus.
               
                   
               

               Having received an invitation from the American Consul, to attend the celebration
                  of the disinterment of the remains of Commodore Porter, the late American Minister
                  at the Turkish Court, I went on board the steamship "Eni Dunia," chartered by the
                  resident Americans for that purpose.
               The Commodore had died some nine months previously, and the body had been kept in
                  spirits, in a large stone coffin; a grave had been temporarily dug for its
                  reception in his own garden, near his summer mansion at St. Stephano.
               The U. S. brig "Truxton" had been sent by the Government expressly to carry the
                  remains of the gallant Commodore to his native, land, and now lay in the Bosphorus
                  for that purpose.
               The party assembled on board the steamer, was very numerous, comprising the
                  foreign ministers of the different countries, the officers of H. B. M. ship
                  "Devastation" and the U. S. brig "Truxton" with the Commander, Lieutenant Upsher,
                  and the resident American and English merchants. We left Stamboul about 11
                  o'clock. It was glorious day, and after a two hours' trip, we anchored at
                  Stephano.
               This is a beautiful little island eighteen miles from Constantinople, occupied by
                  Greek and American families, and also a few Turks.
               We walked in the direction of the late Commodore's dwelling. The old mansion
                  looked gloomy indeed, shaded as it was by tall dark cypress trees. The house had
                  been closed some time, the portion of his family residing with him at the time of
                  his death having left for Galeta.
               We then proceeded to the place of interment. As we neared the vault, we could see
                  the American flag half mast high, waving over the place, a more lovely spot (close
                  to the beautiful sea of Marmora) could not have been chosen; flowers of all kinds
                  were glowing near his grave; roses in full bloom were sending forth their odor,
                  mingled with that of numberless wild plants. Presently came about twenty of the
                  sailors of the Truxton, marching slowly along. Arrived at the grave, they waited
                  for the word of the First Lieutenant; at the given signal the immense coffin was
                  hoisted from its temporary abode; the Commodore's regulation hat was then placed upon it, over which
                  was thrown the Flag of the Union.
               The cortge marched in the following order: First, the Deputies of the principal
                  Legations; second, a piquet from the Truxton; then a body of marines, preceded by
                  the band playing the dead march, followed by the Protestant clergy; next came the
                  coffin, carried by twenty American sailors; then the Ministers of Sardinia and
                  Spain, the Charg d'Affaires of Sweden, Naples, and Belgium supporting the pall;
                  then came the relations of the deceased; after them the American, English, and
                  Russian Officers, Merchants, etc.; the sailors of the Truxton bringing up the
                  rear. When arrived at the stairs, the cortege went on board the steamer; a guard
                  of honor was placed around the coffin, and we quitted the peaceful shores of St.
                  Stephano, one of the sweetest spots in the world.
               When we arrived opposite the Seraglio point, the Truxton fired a salute of
                  seventeen guns, which was answered by the English frigate Devastation. At five we
                  anchored near the Truxton, and the body was soon placed on board.
               Thus finished this interesting ceremony, which was conducted throughout with the
                  greatest decorum, and the utmost solemnity; all alike, from the highest officer to
                  the meanest seamen, seemed deeply impressed with the spirit of the scene.
               The next day I, with my friend Churchill, went to see the "Thousand and one
                  columns." The entrance lay down flights of steps, some hundreds of which we had to
                  descend ere we reached the bottom of the subterranean caverns. The place was damp
                  in the extreme; thousands of miserable, pale-looking Turks were here spinning
                  silk. In olden times this place was used to carry water to its inhabitants. We
                  were shown through the place by one of the spinners for the small sum of five
                  piastres, with which he seemed mightily pleased.
               We then went to the Tomb of the late Sultan Mahmoud; but to attempt to give any
                  idea of the magnificence of this place would be ridiculous; I will simply mention
                  that the tomb alone cost $500,000.
               I had several opportunities of seeing the present Sultan, but, wishing to get a
                  nearer peep, I took a caique, that I might see him as he crossed from his palace
                  on his way to the mosque. Every Friday he visits a different one, either in
                  Constantinople or the suburbs. Not knowing to which one he would direct his steps
                  on this occasion, I went to a coffee-house in the vicinity of the Porte, whence I
                  could conveniently make my observations. All was animation around the Seraglio;
                  black and white eunuchs, court officials, and the Turkish soldiers were all in
                  motion; the latter formed a long chain from the gate of the Seraglio to the chosen
                  mosque. At some distance from each other military bands were placed.
               The Sultan soon appeared, mounted on a very handsome white Arabian horse. The
                  young prince has rather a fine head, but his face is devoid of the slightest
                  expression, somewhat of a pale cast, large dark eyes, aquiline nose, and a very
                  slight mustache and imperial. He was dressed in a blue frock military cut coat,
                  blue trowsers, with red stripe, black French leather boots, whereto small brass
                  spurs were attached. By his side he had a costly scimetar, and the simple red fez, with a blue tassel, was on his head.
               A long suite of pages and court domestics, among whom was recognised the
                  never-failing pipe-bearer, etc., closed the procession. The Sultan seemed to greet
                  the people very courteously.
               I was invited in the evening to the house of my young friend, Churchill. His
                  father (an Englishman by birth) having resided many years in the Turkish capital,
                  and who had married a Greek lady, by whom he had several children, lived quite in
                  the Greek style. His daughters sang and played delightfully, and I was not a
                  little surprised to see on the piano an English copy of the
                  far-fanned song, "Woodman, spare that Tree!" which one of these
                  Greek ladies sang to me! The popularity of this song is unprecedented. There were
                  several Bother pieces of music I noticed published in New York-among them songs by
                  Charles Horn, and a beautiful little ballad by H. C. Watson, entitled, "There's a
                  spot of earth more dear." It seemed funny to hear these songs warbled forth, very
                  sweetly too, by a bewitching Greek girl.
               The carriages used by Turkish ladies, to pay distant visits (the men are all
                  equestrians), afford a singular spectacle
                  tacle. Their vehicles are called, as with us, Kotschi (coaches) or aroba. The box
                  is fixed firmly upon the axle, and, as well as the wheels, is variously painted,
                  and richly gilt, and sometimes covered with red cloth. At the sides there are
                  closed blinds, which sometimes open to let the curious Frank see that an
                  interesting female reposes within upon comfortable pillows, and the thin veil will
                  not unfrequently wave about, in order that she may do execution with her dark
                  gazelle-like eyes. The entrance of the carriage is generally from behind, where a
                  small gilt ladder hangs to facilitate the ascent and descent of its fair
                  burden.
               Two oxen or buffaloes draw the set-out, and are very strongly accoutred. On the
                  brow of each hangs a square, yellow shining plate; between the horns there is a
                  smaller one, with trio vari colored horse's tails, and frequently I have seen both
                  the head and neck of the animals decorated with garlands of flowers. The coachman
                  walks, guiding his steeds with a sharply pointed stick; and, by way of guard,
                  several domestics, armed to the teeth, follow the carriage.
               I was strolling in the afternoon through one of the graveyards in Pera, admiring
                  the beauty and variety of the different tombs, when, in the distance, I saw a
                  funeral procession. As it is probable that my readers might like to have a slight
                  idea of the manner of burial adopted by the Turks, I will endeavor to describe
                  what I witnessed:-
               Four men carried the corpse, which was covered with a variously colored cloth upon
                  a bier. Numbers of Turks, each with a branch of cypress in one hand, while in the
                  other rested the inseparable pipe, followed. The Imam preceded, occasionally
                  reciting sentences from the Koran. When they arrived at the grave, the covering
                  was removed, and the body deposited quite naked. The Imam prayed; the
                  assembly shouted; and the grave was filled with earth. The mourners stuck their
                  branches of cypress around, and a belief prevails if but one of these
                  keep green, the deceased has gone into the cheerful paradise promised by his
                  prophet Mahomet to the faithful.
               There is a sect here called the "Dervises," and the extraordinary style of their
                  worship amused me highly. They practise every Tuesday and Friday at noon, from one
                  to two o'clock, in a small chapel near the Russian palace, and any Frank is
                  allowed a free admittance.
               There is a round box in the middle of the room; they have also another circle
                  surrounded by a balustrade. On the outside of this the populace repeat their
                  prayer. In the inner circle the Dervises collect, clothed in a long dark woollen
                  raiment. They wear also on their heads a high woollen cap, slightly resembling a
                  sugar loaf. Their countenances are uniformly pale, but of a beautiful expression.
                  A short sermon is preached by their priest, after which a melodious song from one
                  of the Dervises is given, sometimes accompanied by flutes. They then move in
                  couples round the circle, their heads bent to the ground, under the guidance of
                  two leaders, whose heads are bound round with a white band, as a mark of dignity.
                  They turn three or four times round, whilst the two leaders squat down in Turkish
                  fashion, in that part of the chapel nearest to Mecca. Then begins their singular
                  dance; casting away their robes they stand up in broad dark green garments,
                  reaching to their knees. One of them immediately stepped forth with closed eyes,
                  and spreading his arms out, turned upon his right knee with great rapidity; a
                  second then performed the same evolution; then others, until the whole company
                  were twirling around like a set of mad people. During this motion, the air
                  spreading out their gowns, gave them the most ludicrous appearance imaginable.
                  This lasted about ten minutes, when suddenly they stood still and firm, and cast
                  themselves to the earth, their faces all being turned towards Mecca. One leader,
                  during the ceremony, went round to see if the gentlemen all twisted upon the right
                  heel! At last, they all kiss the hand of their leaders, and march quietly
                  away.
               It being the time of the Ramazan, I could not obtain admission to any of the
                  mosques, but walked round the exterior of almost all of them. St. Sophia (the
                  oldest mosque in Turkey) does not produce a very agreeable impression; a low wall
                  surrounds the colossal temple, and incloses also an ante-court, decorated with
                  flowers, fountains, and cypresses. The chief dome rises from a heap of pilasters,
                  cupolas, and other ornaments. The dingy-looking appearance of the walls suits the
                  character of this venerable building.
            
            
               
               XVIII.
               STREET SCENES.
               TAKING a walk through the Bazaars, I saw a crowd collected, and found that a poor
                  fellow was about to expiate his life that day by the summary method of
                  decapitation; and never having seen the "modus operandi" of the Turks in this
                  particular, I accompanied the crowd; and as it may be interesting to some of my
                  readers, I give them the benefit of my observations. When a man has been killed,
                  his friends lodge a complaint against the murderer, who is, without loss of time,
                  dragged to the Mehkemmay, or Court of Justice of the district or parish where the
                  crime was perpetrated, and a report is immediately drawn up, stating the
                  particulars of the complaint, on which document he is instantly sent to prison.
                  His trial subsequently takes place before the Grand Vizier, and if it be proved
                  that he designedly, and without sufficient provocation, committed the murder, he
                  is forwarded, with the whole details of his case, to the Sheikh ul Islam, who
                  gives a decree declaring that an individual convicted of such a crime is, by the
                  sacred law, condemned to suffer death by decapitation. Should there be any
                  extenuating circumstances, for which the friends of the culprit imagine that due
                  allowance has not been made, they draw up a petition to the Sultan, demanding a
                  new trial. The matter is then submitted to a supreme Council of Justice, and if he
                  be again condemned, the heir or next akin of the deceased is questioned as to
                  whether he demands Kussass or Deeyet.
               Kussass is the law of retaliation-blood for blood. Deeyet is the price of blood,
                  or pecuniary compensation in lieu of it. This is generally one thousand drachms of
                  silver, or near 1500 dollars, which, being a large sum, the authorities may, in
                  the event of its being accepted in lieu of the life of the culprit, fix suitable
                  periods for the payment, the culprit remaining in prison until the whole amount is
                  paid. It is seldom taken unless in cases where the deceased has left a young
                  family, for whose support the money is required.
               If the heir be an adult, he usually spurns the idea of receiving gold as the price
                  of the blood of his father or brother, and consequently insists upon the
                  forfeiture of his life.
               All the needful preliminaries having been settled, and the murderer condemned, the
                  Grand Vizier (or the Sultan, should he have been petitioned on the subject) signs
                  an order for the execution of the criminal. This order is sent to the Governor of
                  the district, who decrees it over to the chief executioner, to whom he gives his
                  verbal instructions as to the time and place of execution. The executioner has a
                  copy of the sentence drawn out in large legible characters. The time fixed being
                  arrived, he takes with him the order for the execution, on which the jailor
                  delivers his prisoner. The executioner is accompanied by several assistants, who
                  knock off the chains of the culprit, tie his arms behind him, and then he is
                  immediately marched forward, without being informed for what purpose.
               The day was hot in the extreme, and I had already walked some distance, following
                  the immense crowd collected.
               The unhappy man, thus secured and surrounded, and hurried along to the place of
                  execution, near, I was told, where the crime had been committed, and in a
                  thoroughfare through which thousands were constantly passing, he looked the very
                  picture of wretchedness and despair. I shall never forget the look he gave, when
                  suddenly he was told to kneel down! and if previously he had any doubts as to his
                  fate, they were now quickly removed. Resistance was in vain: all hope had fled,
                  and the wretched man did as he was ordered. His eyes were then bound, and the
                  executioner stood for some moments, having already unsheathed his sword, which was
                  straight, long, very broad, and exceedingly sharp. He then assumed an attitude,
                  clenched his teeth, and having made two or three flourishes with his horrid
                  weapon, raised his arm so as to bring his hand to his own left ear, and with the
                  edge, close to the hilt, struck a tremendous blow on the left side of the neck of
                  his victim, just above the shoulders. The man made horrid butchery of his work, and the poor fellow's
                  head was hanging by a portion of the muscle when the executioner seized his hair,
                  and completed the cruel task as well as he could. The head of the culprit rolled
                  in the dust, and no sound was heard save the gurgling of the blood!
               The body was then laid on its back, the head being placed under the right arm; the
                  copy of the sentence was pinned on, the body, which was then left "as a warning to
                  others."
               A thief or a burglar is hanged. His trial and condemnation take place in due form,
                  and the executioners lead him forth in the same way. My friend Churchill described
                  to me the singular method the Turks have of hanging. On reaching the spot chosen
                  for his death, a rope with a sliding knot is thrown over his neck, and drawn
                  pretty closely, the other end is passed over a hook, beam, or very large nail. The
                  signal being given, two or three of the executioner's assistants haul upon it, the
                  executioner himself assisting by lifting the culprit off the ground. The proper
                  height having been attained (and very little suffices), the executioner with a
                  thick stick strikes the rope over the head to tighten it, and adjusts the knot in
                  a suitable position. He then pins, as before, the sentence on the breast, and his
                  task is complete. He departs, and a guard is left to prevent any one from
                  interfering with the body.
               The most shocking punishment is reserved for Haidoots, or highway robbers-viz.
                  impalement; which operation always takes place on a cross-road, and is performed,
                  as nearly as I can recollect, as follows:-
               The packsaddle of a horse is placed on the ground, and rendered firm by being put
                  against a tree, stone, or some other support. This species of saddle has, before
                  and behind, cross bars, to which are attached the loads. The felon is put with his
                  face downwards, and his neck secured on the fore cross bars. Already stripped of
                  everything but his shirt, whilst he lies in this position the executioner makes a
                  cut with his knife, and applies a strong styptic to prevent the flowing of blood.
                  The stake, which may be eight or nine feet long, and is sharply pointed at the
                  end, is then introduced, and beaten out with a heavy mallet, until it appears
                  through the upper part of the body.

               My informant told me that only a few years ago thirteen or fourteen of these
                  robbers were impaled at Adrianople. He was an eye-witness of the scene, and in one
                  case he told me the stick came out at the back of the neck, in another through the
                  chest, in two or three through a shoulder, in one through the throat! and in one
                  instance through the top of the head! He told me, however, that every one of the
                  victims had first been strangled, so that they did not suffer afterwards, though
                  the punishment appears so dreadful. They were formerly set upon the stake alive,
                  and I heard of a case in which a man was at night removed from his stake by his
                  friends, and none of the vital parts having been touched, he lived many years
                  afterwards, but never subsequently stood straight.
               But executions in Turkey are now, I am told, quite rare, and it would seem so, for
                  the one I witnessed created a greater sensation than it would have done in
                  America.
               I went with my friend on board several very beautiful steamboats belonging to the
                  Turkish Government; one in particular, the "Monarch," Capt. Howes, is very large
                  and elegant. She was built in Glasgow expressly for the Government, and is
                  employed in carrying troops to the different islands. There are also many large
                  Austrian and French steamers constantly running to and fro.
               After strolling through the grave-yards at Scutari, I returned to the city about
                  eight, and slept on board the "Eni Dunia" steamer.
               The next day I proceeded with my friend to the "Slave Market." It consists of a
                  quadrangular edifice, including a square area of nearly two hundred feet, and is
                  surrounded with rooms. Long platforms raised from the ground are in front, and you
                  ascend steps, making a kind of colonnade. We entered by a gate, built in a high
                  dark wall, leading to the market of female slaves. Not far from the entrance stood
                  some young negroes, about fifteen years of age, but scantily furnished with
                  clothing. Some old Turks seemed occupied in closely inspecting the luxurious
                  figures of these poor creatures, whom the slave-dealer seemed to be recommending
                  very highly. The place was excessively dirty. The price usually given for a young
                  Circassian is about 7000 piastres, or five hundred dollars, and for a black intended to do servant's work, about eighty
                  dollars.
               We then walked through some of the bazaars, very touch larger and on a more
                  magnificent scale than those of Smyrna. They consist of many very intricate
                  passages, and I should have found it difficult, had I been alone, to have made my
                  way out again. The booths of which the alleys are formed, are divided with great
                  order, so that in each series, wares of only one kind are to be met with.
               I was interested greatly in the beautiful magazines of arms and pipes-but the
                  shawl bazaar surpasses in richness and elegance anything I had ever Witnessed.
                  Cloths of the most delicate texture dazzle the eye with the brilliancy of their
                  colors. The Turks are very simple in their mode of bargaining, they ask but one
                  price, and seem to say in the language of Shakspeare "If you will take it-so; if
                  not, adieu, and for my love I pray you wrong me not." The Jews and Armenians
                  compose a great portion of the population of Constantinople. It is easy to
                  perceive the contempt in which the Jews are held by the Turks, exposed
                  continually, as they are, to all sorts of ill treatment and harsh abuse, in which
                  abuse they are joined sometimes by the Christians residing there.
               I took passage the next day in the French man-of-war steamer Pericles for Smyrna.
                  We arrived in the Dardanelles about noon, where we were detained some hours; had a
                  view of Sestos and Abydos. At the latter place we stopped to take some Turks and
                  their women on board. The women were all closely veiled; no part of the face being
                  visible, except the tip of the nose. We soon passed the Hellespont, only a mile
                  and a half in width.
               This bar is, I believe, the narrowest part of the Dardanelles, and is commanded on
                  each side with extensive forts, batteries, &c., for a very long distance,
                  giving it a formidable and warlike appearance. The scenery of the shores, and the
                  many incidents of fable and history associated with these places, give them
                  peculiar enchantment.
               We arrived at Smyrna the next day.
               After a very delightful run, I found myself once again in the "City of Figs," and
                  I thought if those at home, who were so fond of devouring this much-prized fruit,
                  could have been with me to witness the process of packing, they would not eat them
                  with quite so much relish.
               Up a long and dirty alley-way on each side were seated on the bare ground numbers
                  of the dirtiest and lowest order of Greeks, men, women, boys, and girls, some
                  picking, others stamping and pressing, the freshly-picked fruit into the "drums."
                  With their bare and dirty feet and dirtier hands, they squeeze the fruit into the
                  boxes, moistening and assisting its packing with an occasional stream of saliva
                  from their filthy mouths. The figs are piled up like so many tons of coals, and
                  are shovelled about and handled with little or no regard to care or cleanliness.
                  The packers remain from morning till night in this position, and appear never to
                  tire in their work. But by the time the voyage is over, and the figs are displayed
                  on the tables of the rich as a bonne bouche or dessert after dinner, covered with
                  the nice crisp coating of sugar, the method of packing is not inquired into or
                  cared for, and they slip down as smoothly as if just plucked from the tree.
               The next day I took with me a guide, an Algerine Jew who I found spoke a little
                  English, and, mounting our donkeys, proceeded to the ruins of the old castle I had
                  passed on the previous day. We ascended the hill without much difficulty. Upon
                  arriving at the entrance of the building, I perceived, seated on the ground, some
                  half dozen savage looking fellows, smoking long, dirty-looking pipes while some
                  were cooking an extraordinary Kind of stuff in a queer-looking iron bowl. I went
                  to my guide, wishing to know if it would be safe to pass, understanding from
                  several in Smyrna that robbers very frequently secreted themselves in and about
                  the place, knowing that it is sought after by all travellers.
               My guide told me there was no occasion for any alarm, and asking me for a few
                  cigars, offered a bundle to the foremost of the men, who seemed quite pleased with
                  the present. I could not help looking at the handsome fellows who had excited my
                  suspicion. They were all very much sunburnt, had large black eyes, and teeth of
                  perfect whiteness; a long and queerly-cut moustache covered their lips, which,
                  when their faces were not in repose, made them look doubly savage.
               
               Their singular dress pleased me much-a jacket of red-green velvet, fitting close
                  to the waist, with full sleeves, open all the way down; over this they wore a red
                  fly jacket, thrown loosely over the shoulder; a thick shawl belt circled the
                  waist, from which the hilts of a pair of old-fashioned pistols peeped out, with
                  the silver-hilted handle of a large-sized dagger; full trowsers of white linen
                  came to their knees, their legs being quite bare; jauntily put on their heads, was
                  a cap of red cloth, having a long silk tassel hanging therefrom. A herd of rams
                  was quietly grazing at the old castle entrance, guarded by a ferocious-looking
                  dog, who, upon seeing me, began to bark and move uneasily, but upon getting a
                  pretty smart kick from one of the men, he quietly lay down, leaving us to pass by
                  without interruption.
               We entered through an old archway. Immediately to the right I noticed a small
                  stone building, with a doorway and two steps at its entrance. It was an unoccupied
                  inclosure, and contained a small ruin of an altar, with some steps leading to it,
                  resting against the wall. This place is believed to have been the site of one of
                  the "seven churches" of Asia. The walls were completely covered, from top to
                  bottom, with the initials or names of different distinguished
                  travellers, who had wandered amid these ruins from all parts of the globe. Among
                  them I noticed the euphonious one of "John Smith, Penobscot, Maine!" and several
                  of his relations. Nothing but the bare walls of the castle are remaining. Under
                  the ground are innumerable vaults, which in olden time supplied water to the
                  inmates. There is, also, a subterranean passage cut through to the city, but it is
                  now stopped up, some people having lost their lives in attempting to reach the
                  city by it, in consequence of the impurity of the atmosphere. I carried away with
                  me some pieces of the wall and pavement of the chapel, and after remaining the
                  better part of the day in and about the ruins, I mounted my donkey and returned to
                  the city.
               Having received a polite invitation from Mr. L. to accompany himself and wife to
                  the opera-it being the first night of the season-I soon found myself quietly
                  seated in a private box, listening to a new opera by Donizetti.
               The bills were headed thus- 
                     Aviso Teatrale. Programma. De llo spettacolo con cue verra aperta
                        la stagione. Teatrale di quest anno la sero del 30 Ottobre 1843.
                        Roberto Devreux. Opera in musica del maestro Gaetano
                        Donizetti. le parole sonno del.
                  
               
               The overture was very beautiful, and was played by the band splendidly. The
                  singers did full justice to this lovely opera. The primo tenore had a song in the
                  second act-which is given in prison-of such touching sweetness, and with such
                  exquisite feeling, that the whole audience was in tears. It was a treat indeed.
                  The theatre is rather small, having a parquette, and a first and second tier of
                  private boxes. The price of admission is ten piastres, and thirty for a
                     seat in a private box. They perform three times a week.
               On the following day, having heard a great deal of the Turkish baths, I resolved
                  to try their virtues for myself.
               I accordingly went to the best one I could find in the city. I first entered a
                  room, by the walls of which the most splendid divans are placed for repose; this
                  arrangement seemed quite suited to the sensual character of the orientals.
                  Numerous bathers, entirely naked, with the exception of a thin apron round their
                  waist, and heavy wooden sandals on their feet, with the domestic of the bath,
                  equipped in the same manner, were standing round. We then went into a spacious
                  saloon of moderate temperature: after having stayed a little time, we were led
                  into another room, still hotter: here I felt very faint-as every one does the
                  first time one of these baths is taken. I got over it soon, and presently found
                  myself in the last and hottest yet. Perspiration ran down me in streams-after I
                  had been in five minutes, the sensation was delicious.
               The ceiling of this room was an arched cupola, furnished with a multitude of
                  windows; the walls and floor were of the finest marble; a hot, damp atmosphere
                  fills the entire saloon. This is produced by water being sprinkled upon a highly
                  heated floor. One thinks it impossible to bear this excessive heat at first; but the Turks speedily
                  accustom themselves thereto. In the centre is a square marble elevation, less hot
                  than the floor itself. Upon this the bather sits, and the attendant, whose hands
                  are covered with rough woollen gloves, rubs and kneads the whole body down to the
                  toes with great agility. A tap on the neck is the signal that this part of the
                  ceremony is over.
               I was then conducted to a niche (several of which surround the saloon) supplied
                  with urns, from which hot or cold water can be procured at pleasure. My attendant
                  covered me with soaps of every variety of scent, until I resembled a huge pillar
                  of blancmange. After calling out lustily to the fellow to pump on me, or I should
                  lose my eyes-the soap having penetrated somewhat-and he not having the most
                  distant idea about what I was talking, I seized the cock, when in my
                  flurry I turned the hot water on my head and shoulders, instead of
                  the cold. Here the Turk gave a shriek, reverberating through the whole building,
                  and I a spring that left all past and future vaulters entirely in the
                  shade. The poor fellow beckoned to me to come back; and having pumped on me for
                  some time, rubbed me down, placed a turban of towels round my head, and a piece of
                  flannel round my body, and, having first put on my wooden shoes, returned to the
                  first-mentioned room, I reclined upon one of the beautiful divans, where coffee
                  and a pipe were soon brought to me.
               The exhaustion that now succeeds-the species of tranquillity of soul and
                  body-exceeds everything in its sensual voluptuousness. Thus an hour or more is
                  passed, until this exhaustion is succeeded by a new energy, and a freshly excited
                  state.
               In front of all the baths, as before the mosques, an immense quantity of slippers
                  and boots are always to be found.
               All the Turks leave their boots or shoes behind, that they may not soil the
                  carpets or variegated Egyptian mats, which are usually spread on the mosques and
                  other elegant apartments; they enter with merely their leather sandals, generally
                  attached to the pantaloons.
               There are several very good billiard rooms in the Frank quarter of the town, and
                  some prettily fitted up cafs on the "Marina." This is a promenade for
                  both sexes during the summer evenings, and is generally well filled.
               The vessel in which I intended to sail for Boston being ready for sea, I prepared,
                  to take my leave of the many kind friends I had met with during my short sojourn
                  in this delightful part of the world; and accordingly on the 31st of October we
                  left the good city of Smyrna, in the barque "George Henry," Captain Michael
                  Watson, bound for Boston, Mass. On the 4th of November we found ourselves in the
                  Ionian Sea-saw the land of Greece for the last time-and, with a fair wind, we were
                  soon in the Mediterranean.
               
                   
               
               On the 7th of the month I had a splendid view of Mount Etna, and distinctly saw
                  the snow on its summit.
               Without entering into the minute particulars of a long and very dangerous passage,
                  I will simply state that on the 28th of December we sprung a leak, and several
                  thousand drums of figs were thrown overboard to lighten the vessel. We, however,
                  through the goodness of Providence, and the skilfulness of our Captain-than whom a
                  better sailor or a better man never walked-reached Boston on the 4th of
                  January.
               
               The danger in which we had been involved immediately preceding our arrival
                  enhanced doubly the joy of once again treading solid ground. Our vessel attracted
                  a good deal of attention, on account of her weather-beaten appearance, and
                  curiosity was on tiptoe to see those who had braved with her the perils of the
                  sea. Many came to congratulate us on our safe arrival, and one, knowing the length
                  of time we had been out of fresh meat, was considerate enough to bring with him a
                  large quantity for all hands. I think nothing that I have since tasted, has had
                  the peculiarly rich and indescribable flavor of that beefsteak.
               We went in the ship's boat on shore-the cold was excessive-the snow thick upon the
                  ground-and the trees covered with icicles! How different this from the sunny and
                  luxurious clime so recently left behind! The remembrance drew from me a heartfelt
                  sigh, though probably my chattering teeth and shivering limbs had something to do
                  with it.
               A cheerful fire, and well-known and friendly faces, however, soon began to exert
                  its genial influence, and when I entered the old "Tremont House," and was so
                  cordially greeted by its jolly host, I felt rejoiced in once again being safely
                  housed in the land of my adoption.
            
            
               XIX.
               AT THE FOOT-LIGHTS IN BOSTON.
               STROLLING along Washington street on a cold morning in January, I was accosted by
                  Mr. James Gr. Maeder, the well known composer, who, welcoming me back, remarked
                  that I was just the "boy" he wanted for his opera that he was about to produce in
                  Boston. Now, at the moment I had not the slightest intention of again appearing in
                  public-but the state of my finances (I having about five piastres in my pocket
                  when I landed) was such, that I had to go to work at something immediately.
                  Accordingly after a little reflection, I accepted my friend's offer, and tarried
                  in the city of notions some two weeks, having made my bow to a Boston audience in
                  the opera of the "Peri," I taking the part of "Razlecroft the Wizard," and I
                  believe I may say with considerable success.
            
            
               XX.
               AT HOME.
               ARRIVING in New York once again in the month of March, 1844, with very little
                  money, and without any fixed purpose or intention, it was somewhat refreshing to
                  be greeted very cordially one evening by a gentleman, to whom I had been
                  introduced one night at the Olympic, with the request that I would dine with him,
                  and accompany afterwards to the Park Theatre.
               Upon his inquiring as to what my intentions, pursuits, or occupation, were for the
                  future, and finding my answers extremely vague and indefinite, he invited me to
                  call at his office at the City Hall, on the following day-the County Clerk's, I
                  believe, Mr. James Connor then officiating in that capacity.
               Here, then, in a little dark room-a sort of "tank," I was once again ensconced,
                  assisting my friend B. H. J. in recording, etc., generally winding up our day's
                  labor, which ended at four, by adjourning to "Windust's" in Park Row, and having a
                  good dinner.
               It was in one of those cozy little "boxes" that I first had the pleasure of being
                  introduced to Mr. James T. Brady, who, through all my ups and downs, vicissitudes
                  and changes, has remained my steadfast, firm, and cherished friend. My slender
                  income was slightly augmented, by a situation I obtained in the choir of St.
                  Thomas's Church, I receiving $200 a year as the "basso" thereof. Austin Phillips
                  was the organist, and the singers, Mrs. Edward Loder, Miss Mary Taylor, Mr. Henry
                  C. Watson, and myself.
               
               The summer of this year was passed delightfully, I having been appointed
                  "Coxswain" of the boat "Halcyon," owned conjointly by Mr. Jarvis, Mr. Brady, Mr.
                  Thompson, and Mr. Sam. Jarvis.
               We would leave the foot of Christopher street at about six o'clock, and pull up to
                  the "Abbey," then kept by Van Ransellier, who would provide for the hungry oarsmen
                  a superb supper-returning home by the "light of the moon," and enjoying to our
                  hearts' content the cool night breezes, and the magnificent scenery of the
                  glorious Hudson.
               My friend Mr. J-- had hinted to me the probability of my obtaining a situation in
                  Mr. Brady's office, should he be appointed "Counsel to the
                  Corporation,"-accordingly the reader can judge of my delight, upon seeing one
                  morning in the journals of the day, that he was the gentleman selected for that
                  office.
            
            
               XXI.
               OH! LAW!
               IT was then in the month of June, 1845, that I found myself, the appointed clerk
                  to the "Counsel of the Corporation," seated at a snug little table, at No. 10 Wall
                  street-the name of the firm was then "Brady and Maurice."
               The four years that I remained in this office were certainly passed by me most
                  delightfully-and in looking back through the vista of years, after my world-wide
                  wanderings, and the variety of my pursuits,-I cling with the greatest tenacity to
                  some interesting scenes and incidents that occurred during the four years of my
                  legal apprenticeship.
            
            
               XXII.
               THINGS AT "BRADY AND MAURICE'S."
               MY station was near the door, and it was reserved for me to answer the inquiries
                  of clients, and to inform them, or as to the whereabouts of the head of the
                  firm.

               Sometimes they presented a heterogeneous and motley group, and the odor on a warm
                  summer's day was not of the most delicate flavor, but they certainly had the
                  faculty of enduring longer "waits" than I had ever known in my theatrical
                  career.
               Now the "Governor," as I used to call him, was not quite so hard to
                  find as now, but I must confess that there was a degree of
                  irregularity about his "arrival" and "departure," that sometimes operated very
                  sensibly upon the nerves of the anxious "clients," and rendered my duties very
                  perplexing.
               Occasionally some very (to me) amusing incidents took place.
               One old man named Smith, who first attracted my attention by the extraordinary cut
                  of his clothes, and hat, presented himself, in somewhat the following style, once
                  every other day, for about four years; and to this day I never knew-and I'm
                     sure he didn't-what he came for-or why he so patiently and silently
                  waited for so many hours, in the vain expectation of being gladdened by a sight of
                  Mr. B.
               The door would slowly open, and by the time I had looked up, I saw nothing but the
                  back of a man, that seemed all hat and coat, the tails almost touching his heels.
                  His hat, which bore the marks of age very strongly, and looked as if it had been
                  as often sat upon as worn on the head, was drawn far over the face, resting upon
                  the end of a large and very red nose, that seemed constantly requiring the
                  application of a very dirty spotted cotton pocket-handkerchief. The coat was
                  closely buttoned to the throat, but hung very loosely on his figure, giving the
                  impression that he had either fallen away very materially, or that it had belonged
                  to his great-grandfather. The cuffs, which bore strong evidence of their being
                  used when the handkerchief was in the laundry, entirely covered his hands; and his
                  trowsers, which fitted his legs very tightly, and were of the oldest "cut," upon
                  his taking a seat, retreated far up his legs, revealing a pair of very dirty
                  socks, and a half-boot, that would have been a good companion for "Boss Richard's
                  in Chatham street.
               Well, he would give a slight puff or two, if it was summer mer, or a shiver if it was winter, put his hat
                  under the chair, and sit, and sit, and sit, saying nothing, looking at nobody, and
                  apparently lost in thought, or endeavoring to get at the cause of his
                  difficulty.
               His case was one, that at the time I took a great interest in, partly from the
                  fact of my utter ignorance of its merits, and partly from the fun we all had,
                  whenever old Smith came to see the "Counsellor."
               I was greatly interested in the case of a poor little Irishwoman, long before I
                  was informed by Mr. B-- of the nature of her repeated visits; not only the
                  neatness of her costume, the punctuality of her appearance, generally, upon the
                  Saturday of each and every week of the year, but the persistency with which she
                  seemed to cling to the desire of her heart, aroused my sympathies.
               The snow would be thick on the ground, and the cold intense, still the door would
                  quietly open, and with her pretty face glowing with cold, and the excitement of
                  her long walk, and with a little courtesy, she would ask, "Is Mr. B-- in, sir, if
                  you please?" and often in a hot day in August, would this faithful little woman
                  trudge from her home in Williamsburgh, upon the same errand of love and
                  affection.
               It appears that her husband was serving out a term of years in the State Prison,
                  but his case presenting some mitigating circumstances, the clemency of Governor
                  Kent was invoked in his behalf, by her faithful adviser Mr. B--, the result being,
                  that her husband was released, and the little woman's heart made glad.
               I shall never forget the beautiful expression of the face of that poor but
                  handsome Irishwoman, as she entered the office to thank, in her artless and
                  sincere manner, Mr. B-- for his efforts in her behalf; and I envied him the
                  pleasurable emotions of gratification, that must have been his, upon seeing her
                  wildering delight, and hearing her heartfelt and honest ejaculations of
                  thankfulness to the Almighty, and of blessings, that she so earnestly prayed might
                  be showered on the head of her benefactor.
               It was Christmas morning when she received the joyful news, and there were at
                  least two hearts in old St. Patrick's Cathedral that not only beat in unison, but
                  whose humble offerings of gratitude and thankfulness, as they knelt together in
                  the temple, must have been acceptable to Heaven. So many delightful associations,
                  remembrances, and reminiscences are connected with my four years' sojourn here,
                  that I find it difficult, vivid as the scenes sometimes appear to me, to bring
                  some of the most prominent and interesting to the notice of the reader.
               There were four in the office, exclusive of the principals, viz. P. B. S., J. B.
                  S., J. D. B., and myself, and occasionally a boy. Our relative positions and
                  stations were well understood, and I think I can say, we lived in perfect harmony,
                  good-will, and peace with each other.
               The heavy work of the office fell principally upon P. B. S., and when the reader
                  is informed that upon Mr. Brady taking possession of the Counsel's chair there
                  were over six hundred suits to be attended, he will see that the office was no
                  sinecure.
               Though I was still looked upon as a student of law, my investigations into the
                  mysteries and intricacies of that delightful profession were not a wit more
                  extensive than when my presence illumined the office of Mr. Nevins in Buffalo;
                  indeed, if any thing I was more ignorant than ever. But with the pen (which Mr.
                  Richelieu says is mightier than the sword), I was entirely at home, and often have
                  "got through" one hundred and fifty folios in a day. Indeed I think I may say that
                  the caligraphic efforts of this office excited the admiration of Mr. Mayor Mickle
                  and the entire corporation. We had a carte blanche at Rich and Loutrell's, the
                  stationers, where Albert H. Nicolay (now a successful auctioneer), with his
                  blandest smile, would hand me the choicest articles of pens, ink, paper, silk
                  tape, etc., etc., and about twice a year the bill, which was paid upon being
                  carefully examined and audited, as all claims against the City usually are.
               The monotony of the day, in the usual routine of the office business, was
                  sometimes relieved by making some rough caricatures of ourselves and our clients,
                  that for the time created a good deal of merriment; one in particular was hugely
                  relished by all who understood the joke.
               It appears a "motion" (I think they call it) had to be made against Mr. Charles O'Conor, in "Chambers."
                  Now I was given to understand, by Mr. Maurice, that this was a very simple matter,
                  and that as all the other gentlemen in the office were engaged, and that he could
                  not possibly leave, it fell upon me to "open the case."
               The dread of a "first appearance on the stage" vanished into nothingness, in
                  comparison with this fearful ordeal-that, too, against the great Mr. O'C.; and the
                  more Mr. Maurice endeavored to explain the case to me, the more agitated,
                  confused, and agonized were my feelings.
               "You see," said he, "it is simply this. You must move for judgment on proof of the
                  filing (or rasping, or something like it) of the lis
                     pendens, (or suspenders, I forget which,) and urge the ground that no
                  fraud was shown on the execution of the mortgage-(I wished that the
                  man who did make it had been executed first)-and that the onerous probandi lay on the defendant, and he had utterly failed to
                  effect a conviction on the mind of the referee." Something was said about the
                     animal quo, or quo
                     animo-perhaps both; but if it was the former, I saw that
                  animal in the shape of a very extensive elephant before I had finished; for on
                  arriving at the "Chambers," and whilst waiting for the motion, an impertinent
                  officer pronounced the magical words, "Sit down," and motioned or rather thrust me
                  into a chair near a hot stove, I thinking that by the time the side nearest the
                  stove should be well cooked, I should be effectually roasted in front by O'Conor
                  and the Court. A profuse perspiration burst out from every pore, and between the
                  oven on the one hand, and the dread and uncertainty of the thing I was about to
                  attempt on the other, I was thrown into a condition of mental and physical agony,
                  which was seriously augmented by the Court asking Mr. O'Conor if "he had a motion
                  to bring on!"
               Mr. O'Conor replied, that he expected some one from Mr. Brady's
                  office, who would move for the confirmation of a referee's report, which he then
                  attended "to oppose." This was said with a glance at me, and a good
                  deal of emphasis on the words some one. "On this hint" I attempted to
                  speak, and in making an effort to rise, discovered, by the vast weight which
                  appeared to be resting on my knees, that my avoirdupois had increased to about six
                  tons within the previous five minutes.
               I managed to "get off" the name of the case, for that was written very legibly on
                  the outside of the bundle of papers that I held in my trembling hand; and I then
                  began to feel my reason gradually giving way. At this critical juncture, P. B. S.
                  came to my relief, and in a masterly manner "put the thing entirely through."
               I had not the remotest idea then, neither have I now, what it was all about; and
                  indeed this is the rule-without one single exception-in all the cases of a legal
                  nature in which my valuable services have been required.
            
            
               XXIII.
               I START FOR CALIFORNIA.
               I REMAINED in the office of B. and M. until the latter end of the year 1848, about
                  which time the California fever raged nigh.
               I, with numberless others, caught the complaint, and accordingly, in the month of
                  January, 1849, I bid good-bye to my friends in New York, and started for
                  Baltimore, from which port, on the 13th of the month, I, with about one hundred
                  others, sailed in the schooner Sovereign, Captain Peterson, bound for Vera Cruz,
                  intending to take the overland trip through Mexico to reach San Francisco.
               Some three or four days out, however, great disagreement occurred among the
                  passengers; and it ended in our inducing the captain to head his vessel for
                  Chagres, taking our chances of finding a vessel at Panama to convey us to the
                  golden land.
               I shall quickly pass over the scenes and incidents of this dreary and dismal trip,
                  relating only one or two of the most comical and tragic.
               The Isthmus was not then, as now, crossed in four hours, but the transit took
                  about a week. We rested for a while in the romantic village of Chagres, which
                  consisted of series of mud huts, dingy,
                  dirty, and ugly natives, forlorn-looking and half-starved chickens, skeleton dogs,
                  and a few stray and half-starved-looking mules. The heat was intense, and our
                  prospects most gloomy.
               After forty-eight hours' propelling, by naked native boatmen, in a sort of covered
                  canoe, up the Chagres River, we landed at Gorgona, a town very similar to the one
                  we had just left.
               Here we pitched our tents-(we were six in company: Dr. D., C. L., T., A. D., S. F,
                  and myself,)-and at night formed ourselves into a watch or guard, for mutual
                  protection.
               Now it must be understood by the reader, that I have never in my life
                  but once fired off a pistol or a gun. On the occasion referred to, being on a
                  Fourth of July excursion with a friend, we were firing at a target, which was
                  fixed on a haystack, somewhere in New Jersey, when I, standing within five or six
                  yards of the stack, actually missed it;-consequently, I felt a little nervous,
                  upon being told, one night, that it was my turn to go on guard, and that I should
                  have to remain on duty four hours, and carry a musket, pistol, and
                  bowie-knife.
               To make my agony more intense, we had been informed that one or two bears had
                  recently been seen and heard in our immediate neighborhood; and that tigers and
                  panthers, attracted by the smell of the cooking of the emigrants,-prowled about at
                  night quite near our camps; that thieves were common; and that unless, when the
                  watchword was required, it was immediately responded to, the one on guard was
                     shot dead.
               
               As night came on, I began to feel the awful responsibility of my position. I had
                  been fully instructed by one of our company in my duties; and provided by him with
                  a musket loaded to the muzzle, (the lock of which I was afraid to look at, let
                  alone touch it, for fear it should "go off,") a Colt's revolver, and a
                  bowie-knife, used in the day time for eating purposes.
               The night was excessively dark, a very heavy dew was falling, and altogether, the
                  gloom outside and inside the several tents seemed universal.
               I relieved the guard at twelve o'clock at midnight, and of course had to remain on
                  duty until four. The knowledge of my utter ignorance of matters military, as also
                  of the proper use of fire arms, rendered my position very perplexing, and upon the
                  slightest noise I found myself not only shaking from head to foot, but stammering
                  out the "watch-word," feeling certain that at the proper time I should certainly
                  forget it.
               Two or three hours-they seemed months to me-had actually passed, and the morning
                  began to dawn in the dim distance, when I distinctly saw a large dark object,
                  moving slowly but steadily towards the tent, in front of which I stood.
               I shook from head to foot, I knew not what to do. I tried to speak, and found that
                  both the "watch-word," and my voice, had gone off together. I would have
                  "hollered" right out, if I could; but that, though it might have aroused the
                  sleepers, would, I fancied, have brought down upon me instant destruction. The
                  object came nearer and nearer; I was certain it was a bear!-and I had actually
                  summoned sufficient resolution and courage to point the butt-end of my
                     gun at it, and probably in another moment would have shot myself, when
                  my unknown tormentor, who on all fours, and covered up with a black piece of
                  india-rubber cloth, made the resemblance so perfect to an animal, threw off the
                  covering, and with a roar resembling a wild beast, caused me to drop all my
                  fire-arms, and run for my life!
               The Doctor (for it was he) considered it a first-rate joke, as did all the
                  party.
               I didn't "see it" exactly, as the man says in the play; but all I know is, that I
                  have been more on my "guard" ever since.
               The rest of my journey across the Isthmus was performed on the back of a mule.
               Up to this period my donkey-riding had been strictly confined to a six-penn'orth,
                  on the aforesaid animal-that is an hour's worth-on Hampstead Heath, or on the
                  Sands at Margate. I soon found to my great annoyance and fear, that the Spanish
                  mule, or at least the one with which I was furnished, was not quite so tractable
                  or docile as your English donkey; for upon being hoisted upon the back of one of these ugly looking animals by my
                  muchacho, he commenced balancing himself on his fore-legs, and giving a kind of
                  he-hau! that had the desired effect of pitching me off over his head, much to the
                  delight of everybody, excepting myself. Regaining my saddle, and finding it
                  impossible to be transferred to a less vicious animal, I proceeded on my journey,
                  endeavoring to keep up with one or two of our party.
               To those of my readers who remember the "rainy season" on the Isthmus of Panama,
                  in January, 1849, these reminiscences will be fully appreciated, but will be
                  little understood by the tourist to the "diggings" at the present day, who is
                  transported from the Atlantic to the Pacific in luxuriant cars, over a capital
                  railroad, and in four hours' time!
               Away I went, fording rivers, tumbling into holes, donkey's belly-band giving way,
                  saddle sliding off, and I with it-donkey cuts and runs-I after him-up to my middle
                  in water-night coming on-dread of the fever, find myself alone-narrow, stony,
                  flinty, and rugged pathway-all sorts of animals my companions, lizards, monkeys,
                  alligators, snakes innumerable-boy catches donkey, fixes saddle, I remount, again
                  to be jolted, again to be thrown off-boy wallops donkey, donkey kicks. I this
                  time, by, the "united aid of mane and tail," keep my seat-jolt, jolt, jolt, bump,
                  bump, bump-off the donkey starts at a gallop. I, a mass of jelly and perspiration,
                  stick to him like bricks-donkey comes to a stand-still-I am delighted and breathe
                  freer-rivers, bogs, holes, precipices, streams, hills, valleys, are by me and
                  Rosinante bravely passed, and the old towers of Panama at last loom up in the
                  distance.
               Eight days after we left Chagres we found ourselves in Panama.
               Completely fagged out, jaded and "used up," I gladly availed myself as soon as
                  possible, of a lay-down, and a bath, at the "American Hotel."
               This establishment was not exactly equal to the Metropolitan; but after the
                  fearful privations I had hitherto endured, anything was acceptable.
               Panama is the capital of New Granada, and one of the oldest cities in South
                  America.
            
            

               XXIV.
               A STRANGE, ADVENTURE AT THE ISLAND OF TOBOGO.
               WE remained here about a week, during which time our party had managed to charter
                  the English bark, "John Ritson," Captain Kennedy, recently arrived from Mary-port,
                  Cumberland, (England,) with a cargo of coal, for the use of the English
                  steamers-to convey us to San Francisco.
               We were some 250 passengers and crew; and left the harbor of Panama, in the
                  beginning of February, 1849, first stopping at the Island of Tobogo for water.
               Here a singular incident happened to me.
               I had been rambling over one of the mountains in the vicinity of the island, and
                  was greatly exhausted and fatigued with the heat and the trip, and with my
                  companion, Dr. B--, had found out a native hut, which at the same time had the
                  appearance of a place of refreshment. In we ventured, and we managed between us,
                  with the aid of a little book of Spanish and English dialogues, to make known our
                  wishes.
               A thin and haggard-looking white woman was cooking some extraordinary dish in an
                  earthen pot, and I noticed that she looked at me rather steadily. At last upon my
                  companion calling me by name, she suddenly stepped up to me, and in a strong
                  Scotch accent, said: "Ah! Sir, ken ye the name o' Dr. Massett?" At first I thought
                  she was slightly deranged, but upon her continuing, "Ah, Sir, I ken him veery
                  weel, there's sic a reseemblance to him as died in Carthagena, that I thought you
                  were his brither!"
               I started, and replied: "Do you refer to Dr. Samuel M--, who married the British
                  Consul's daughter in Carthagena, Mr. W--, and died there in 1826?"
               "I do indeed, sir," she said. "I nursed the gentleman in his last illness, and he
                  died in my arms, sir!"
               I need not say I was deeply interested and affected by this strange and
                  extraordinary adventure.
               
               Twenty-three years had passed away since the death of my eldest brother, who had
                  fallen a victim to the ravages of yellow fever during his first year's residence
                  in South America; and in the very fastnesses of a barren mountain, many miles
                  distant from the main-land, am I recognised as his brother, by an old Scotch
                  nurse, who was the first to give a member of his family the deeply interesting
                  though painful particulars of his last moments.
               The little hut was visited by me every day, and at parting I felt sad and
                  sorrowful.
               To attempt any adequate description of the horrors of the voyage on board the
                  "John Ritson," would not only be utterly useless, but impossible.
               The trip to Acapulco in Mexico, for instance, is usually made in five or six days
                  from Panama, by the Steamships of the P. M. S. S. Company. We accomplished it in
                  thirty.
               The voyage from Acapulco to San Francisco is usually performed in seven to eight
                  days. We were sixty-five days in reaching it.
               The facts are briefly these. The vessel was vilely provisioned, and the captain,
                  an ignorant and illiterate North Shields mariner, was anxious to make all he could
                  "out of the dom Yankees" as he called us, and instead of laying in any extra
                  provision, he permitted his ship to go to sea in the worst possible condition,
                  with musty flour, wormy bread, rotten meat, and filthy water.
               Upon leaving Acapulco, the winds were very light, and we crept along at a snail's
                  pace. When out some two or three days, entirely out of sight of land, and right in
                  the tropics, we were becalmed, and remained stationary for over four
                     weeks.
               
               How the time passed I know not. The heat was perfectly fearful, so much so, that
                  double awnings were spread over our heads, and added to this, it was announced by
                  the ship's doctor, that there were one or two cases of malignant fever on board,
                  and the utmost precaution was necessary to prevent its spreading amongst the
                  passengers and crew.
               

                  A THIRTY DAY'S CALM ON THE PACIFIC.
                  OH! the horrors of those thirty days and thirty nights! The sea a sheet of
                     glass; not a ripple on its surface, the scorching, burning, furnace-like, and
                     enervating rays of the sun penetrating even the double thick awning of canvas,
                     and rendering the deck too hot to walk on with slippered feet, not one single
                     breath of air-all motionless and still-scant of provisions and water-and, as if
                     to aggravate our miserable condition, it was on the sixth day announced, that
                     the fever had broken out among the passengers, that it was infectious, and the
                     greatest precaution must be used to prevent its progress.
                  The dark wing of the angel of death hovered over the doomed ship, and two that
                     night left us for the "undiscovered country."
                  The scene was painfully impressive.
                  The heat was so great in the cabins, that all who could find room on the deck
                     carried up their mattresses and bedding, passing the night thereon. On the
                     upper deck, hammocks had been swung for those who were sick, and every
                     attention it was possible to give them, they received. The two cases I refer to
                     were briefly these.
                  A young man, not over twenty-three, had managed to get a passage on board the
                     ship at Acapulco-he having taken the overland route through Mexico-and full of
                     apparent health and vigor, with the highest hopes and expectations of success
                     in the new El Dorado, had joined our ship's company.
                  It appears that he had been indulging freely in the fruits which the natives
                     for a trifling sum offer for sale, and to allay his thirst, had drunk to excess
                     of the arguad'ente-a very inferior sort of liquor that is sold here, and thus
                     became the first victim.
                  From the first he was perfectly conscious of his approaching fate-and in the
                     most pitiable and heartrending manner called by name upon his relatives in his
                     far distant home. I never shall forget the look of intensity and despair as his
                     full black eyes, streaming with tears, looked up into mine, and exclaimed, "Oh!
                     God-am I never to see my dear mother
                     again?-do-do," turning to the doctor, "try and save me!" and almost immediately
                     after he had spoken these words, his cheeks assumed the unmistakable death
                     pallor, and without uttering another word, he lingered in a perfectly
                     unconscious state until midnight, when he died.
                  The other was an old man seventy-eight years of age, who had actually joined
                     our vessel at Acapulco, with all the implements, tools, and utensils for a life
                     of toil in the diggings, and who with his servant had taken passage for the
                     land of gold.
                  But death had marked him for one of his victims-and after an illness of two
                     days, he expired.
                  Hammocks were slung on the upper decks, and in them rested the dying and the
                     dead.
                  The moon was at its full. The doomed ship lay still upon the waters-the sails
                     hung lazily against the mast-the heat was most oppressive-there seemed to be no
                     air at all-the deck was strewed with passengers-some sleeping-some
                     watching-some talking in subdued tones-others listlessly lounging over the
                     bulwarks.
                  The night was beyond description beautiful-although our frightful circumstances
                     made its very beauty a mockery. The intense heat of the midday sun had given
                     place to the milder beamings of the silvery orb, and despite the oppressiveness
                     of the atmosphere, there was a sense of some relief in the motionless ship,
                     with its burden of the living and the dead. Suddenly a shrill scream rang
                     through the ship, and all eyes were turned to the hammock where the old man
                     lay. His eyes were wide open-his jaw had fallen-the death dew lay on his
                     forehead, and as the moon fell brightness. "There's another gone," says the
                     captain, "call the watch to sew him up, he must be thrown overboard
                     immediately!"
                  There's no knowing who'll be the next!
                  The unseen messenger was quietly walking through the ship, and singling out his
                     victims, and each seemed to look at his fellow with sympathy, suspicion, and
                     even dread.
                  The burial service was hurried over, and heavy stones attached to the feet of
                     the dead men-who had first been sewed up in thin blankets, and afterwards in
                     some canvas.
                  They were placed upon a board in a slanting position, and at a given signal
                     were tossed into the sea.
                  The little son of the old man, only some thirteen years of age, stood by the
                     ratlins, sobbing bitterly, and imploring some one to take care of him. We all
                     tried to comfort-to reassure him that he should be well looked after; when, oh
                     horror! he burst out afresh with an exclamation that his father
                        was not dead-that he had been thrown overboard too soon-and
                     that he and his companion in death were swimming to the ship! All eyes were
                     turned to the spot; and there in the bright moonlight could be seen the heads
                     of the victims, turned apparently to their late abiding-place and imploring for
                     aid and succor; and there for days, in sight of the ship's crew-aye, days-they
                     remained; the heavy stones that had been attached to their feet had slipped
                     away, and the bodies arose to the surface.
                  
                      
                  
                  But I must draw a veil over this dismal-this soul-harrowing scene; and could I
                     inspire the reader with a tithe of the ecstatic emotions of pleasure
                     experienced by that distressed ship's company when the heart-stirring cry of "a
                     breeze! a breeze!" was heard I should rejoice. As the gentle ripple on the water, at first a small
                     black specie, appeared larger and larger, until tiny waves chased each other in
                     multitudinous and miraculous succession-all sparkling and dancing in the bright
                     silvery light, and play-fully splashing against the sides of our big ship,
                     which, feeling the freshening impulse, moved from her fathomless moorings, and
                     fluttering her wings to the wind, sped onward once again in the direction of
                     the Golden Land, I felt a thrill of indescribable pleasure, and gave vent to my
                     feelings in tears of joy.
                  "Once more upon the waters," how we danced and skipped and pranced through the
                     waves; for the breeze had freshened into a pretty stiff gale, and our ship, as
                     if wishing to make up for lost time, sped onward with lightning swiftness.
                  Off Cape St. Lucas, the first sight we obtained of the land of California, the
                     wind increased to almost a hurricane, and the contrast was indeed great to the
                     lengthened calms we had so recently experienced.
               
            
            
               XXV.
               ARRIVAL AT SAN FRANCISCO.
               ON the ninety-eighth day of our departure from Panama we arrived at the entrance
                  to the Golden Gate, and on the morning of the ninety-ninth day entered the long
                  looked for city of San Francisco, a city of tents and wooden shanties, somewhat
                  difficult to describe, as a description of its actual condition in '49 would seem
                  fabulous, as compared with any subsequent account.
               As a faithful chronicler of my individual fortunes and adventures, I will state,
                  that my amount of capital upon reaching the New El Dorado was six dollars in
                  Mexican coin; one of the causes of the fearful depletion in the stock financial
                  being a propensity to indulge in the good things of this life on board the John
                  Ritson. Thus, starvation almost stared me in the face, when it suddenly became
                  known that one of our German steerage passengers had purchased several hams and
                  boxes of red herrings in Acapulco; these, at the proper time, he ladled out to the
                  tune of one dollar a slice and fifty cents for a
                  herring.
               Being, unfortunately for my pocket, very fond of both these edibles, I invested
                  several dollars in this line, until I found my funds had dwindled down to the
                  scanty amount above named.
               The German lived on a biscuit a day; and by the time of our arrival had, I heard,
                  possessed himself of one or two hundred dollars, with which he commenced
                  operations, and in the short space of six months left with (what he considered) a
                  fortune.
               The first person I met, that I had known slightly when in Mr. Brady's office in
                  New York, was Col. J. D. Stevenson, who very kindly greeted me on the morning of
                  my arrival. The Colonel, who it will be remembered was in command of the
                  California Regiment that left New York in 1846, asked me what my intentions were
                  in coming to California; and finding, as usual, that I had no very definite object
                  in my ramblings? suggested that I should come the next day to his office, saying,
                  "You are just the young man for me. You, of course, understand drawing deeds,
                  mortgages, & c.; in fact, the general routine of a lawyer's office, You've
                  been in a good school, and I think we can get along very well together. I have
                  just purchased a tract of land-am going to build a new city-a second New York,
                  sir! I call it, sir, 'New York of the Pacific,' sir. I'll make you Alcalde, sir!
                  Notary Public, sir! Mayor of the City, sir! Come and breakfast with me, sir,
                  to-morrow."
               "At what time, colonel?" I feebly remarked.
               "At six o'clock, sir-always rise with the lark-nothing like getting up early,
                  sir-business man, sir. Go to bed early-keep steady-don't drink, and your fortune's
                  made in no time! As to pay, I give you $150 a month to commence, with, and your
                  board-that's two ounces ($32) a week!"
               I could scarcely stand. I was afraid the Colonel had made a mistake, and meant
                  $150 a year! (But I soon found out that everything went by the month
                  in California.) The stories of the Arabian Nights, the exploits of Baron Munchausen, faded into insignificance,
                  compared with my exploits; and when the Colonel, asking me if I wanted any money,
                  was informed that there was a debt owing to a person on board of some $260, that I
                  was very anxious to cancel, replied, "Oh yes, sir; tell him to come to the office
                  in the morning, and I'll weigh him out the dust" I knew not whether I
                  stood on my head or my heels, so delirious was I with surprise and delight.
               My companions (the Coopers), kind-hearted Marylanders, whose generous offers of
                  friendship and consideration I shall never forget, and who, one and all, if they
                  ever read these lines, will be good enough, at this late day, to accept my warmest
                  thanks, congratulated me on my good fortune, and joined with me in a general
                  "hooray!" at my streak of luck-I being the first one of our ship's
                  company that had found employment.
               The next day, bright and early, I found out the Colonel, and after breakfast went
                  with him to the office, which stood in those days on Montgomery street, at about
                  where Genella's crockery store now stands, and next door to Joe Bedleman's
                  store.
            
            
               XXVI.
               COLONEL STEVENSON'S OFFICE.
               IT was a wooden shanty, with a door that opened with a rusty old latch,
                  immediately behind which was a wooden bunk, that was occupied at that time by the
                  bookkeeper of C. W. Ross, a Scotchman by the name of Crogan. The room had one
                  window in it that looked on the bay, the water, at high tide, coming up to our
                  door sill, so that frequently I have had to wade up to my middle to get into my
                  crib!
               The walls were adorned with large maps, most gorgeously got up by my fellow clerk,
                  who happened to be a brother Englishman, named Rowe. The "desk" was a long deal
                  board, relieved at intervals by two old tea cups (both full of ink), paper, pens;
                  and by its side was a cupboard, with two or three nameless utensils filled with
                  gold dust; three wooden stools, very shaky and rickety, and the fixtures and
                  furniture are complete.
               On the outside the people were informed that that was J. D. Stevenson's Land
                  Office and Agency of Lots in "New York of the Pacific."
               Immediately under this they were also informed that Stephen C. Massett was a
                  Notary Public and Commissioner of Deeds.
               The rush for lots in this magnificent embryo city was great.
               It was something in this style:-Man, just from the mines, comes in, and wants to
                  invest his surplus "gold-dust."
               "Got any good lots, Col.?" Col. S-- rises, and with a long stick points to the
                  map, offering a few remarks like these to the astonished and bewildered
                  purchaser.
               "You see, sir, these lots are what we call water lots, sir. I couldn't part with
                  these under $1000 a lot, as from their position-this being the head of
                     navigation, sir-that is a fixed fact, sir-they will command shortly a
                  very high figure. Now these on F. street I have reserved for the 'public schools.'
                  I am determined to have an institution of this kind properly cared for-and next to
                  this, sir, I have placed these lots on A. M. and A. for the 'Court House,' 'City
                  Hall,' and the 'Hall of Records and Mayor's or Alcalde's office,'" (pointing to
                  me, and remarking that I had just arrived from New York to take charge of this
                  highly responsible, lucrative, and dignified position!)
               The excited miner, with visions of prospective wealth, in the rapid and astounding
                  advance of real estate in this golden land, pulls out his buckskin bag, and away
                  rattles the gold into the Chinese scales; he takes two lots, pays his
                  $500 (they are $250 apiece). I make out the "deeds," record them immediately, in
                  fact do everything that in such cases is usually done, made, and provided.
               The man leaves his gold-dust, and takes his deed-neither one nor the other to be
                  heard of afterwards. This, during my stay in this exalted sphere of action, was
                  invariably the case-with one single and honorable exception-which I shall
                  presently mention.
               
               Vessels were arriving almost daily from the Eastern States, particularly from New
                  York, luring hundreds and hundreds of gold-seekers-many having letters of
                  recommendation to "Col. Stevenson," some from those who knew the Col. only by
                  name, others from old friends in the East.
               Letters of introduction are very frequently an inconvenience, both to the giver
                  and receiver, and as a means of intercourse ought to be very sparingly indulged
                  in; but when they come by the dozen a day-they were sometimes more and sometimes
                  less, they really become a nuisance almost intolerable.
               One morning in particular I shall not easily forget.
               The office was completely filled with "new arrivals," all anxious for direction
                  and advice, and all feeling that the "Col." ought to be delighted to see them, and
                  bestow upon them his entire, and undivided attention.
               "Could you inform us, Col., which of the mines is the best to start for? How much
                  gold they are taking out-could you show us some-how much does it cost to get up
                  there, etc. etc.," and a thousand such queries would be asked and expected to be
                  replied to. If the Col. was busy he would refer them to me, when of course, from
                  my personal observation and lengthened residence in the country, they questions
                  were very satisfactorily answered.
               "The Southern mines, I think, are turning out larger quantities than any other," I
                  replied; this was a standing answer.
               On the day in question a clerical-looking individual, with a wife and two
                  children, presented himself to the "Col." with a letter of introduction. And the
                  liberal offer of the Col. to present him free gratis with a lot of
                  land (provided he would build a house within thirty days!) in the
                  beautifully situated, and flourishing town of "New York of the Pacific," with the
                  prospect of being the very first clergyman settled in that delightful locality;
                  and the additional promise of the "Col.," that the particular church, ordered by
                  himself, and which was then "coming round the Horn," should be under his entire
                  guidance and direction, induced the unfortunate minister of the gospel to pack up
                  his traps that afternoon, and with his wife and infant children, and to leave in
                  ail open boat for the scene of his future labors.
               If the reader, some weeks afterwards (for it had taken them seven days in an open
                  boat to get up there), had seen the forlorn-looking object that presented itself
                  at the office, upon inquiry almost daily, if the "tabernacle" had arrived, he
                  would indeed have pitied him.
               Prior to their having been almost entirely eaten up by mosquitoes, his wife and
                  children had died of chills and fever, while he, with his face covered with
                  blotches and pimples, was shaking with the same complaint.
               After muttering to himself-that it was "the Lord's doings, and marvellous in his
                  eyes," he left the office, and was never seen or heard of afterwards!
               
                  
                     See page 107.
                  
               
               Incidents most comic were occurring daily; but decidedly one of the "cutest" and
                  smartest, in reference to the purchasing of lots in the new and flourishing town
                  of "New York of the Pacific," and the subsequent repudiation thereof, was the
                  following, which will be fully appreciated, if these lines ever fall beneath the
                  eye of my old friend, Dick E--, of
                  Philadelphia, now of Leghorn; it being the only instance in the memory of mortal
                  man of the slightest realization of any money once invested in this (supposed to
                  be) wonderful and rapidly growing locality.
               Captain Mahlon D. E--, then, was the commander of a small-sized schooner, that he
                  proposed running on the San Joaquin and Suisun Bay Rivers. He had been successful
                  in his mining operations, and had returned to the "Bay" with several large and
                  small-sized buckskin bags filled with the "ore." Attracted by the wonderful
                  reports of the "Colonel's" newly laid out city, and of the rapidity of its growth,
                  as also of the immense amount of lots that were daily sold; of the positive
                  certainty of their future advancement, these were sufficient inducements for the
                  gallant captain to present himself at our office, and in the blandest manner ask
                  to inspect the map of the Colonel's flourishing city. I turned round, and to my
                  great surprise saw a handsomely dressed, good-looking fellow, with an immense
                  shirt-collar on. This latter was a luxury rarely indulged in, and it therefore
                  excited my attention, for washing be it known was then eight and nine dollars a
                  dozen! Upon my pointing out five available lots-lots that would certainly double
                  in value in two months-and as the purchaser promised to build within thirty
                     days (the old dodge), the "Col." in consideration thereof put at the
                  surprisingly low figure of $1000.
               Well-I made out the deeds and pocketed my $25 for recording--this was
                  clear profit-the captain left the "land-office" with his five deeds, revelling
                  doubtless in visions of being prospectively a wealthy landowner. Two months came
                  along-so did the captain-who had tried in vain to get within miles of the
                  locality, having I think he said lost several boats in endeavoring to reach the
                  shore-and after great exertion in finding the "ranch," was rendered stone-blind by
                  the myriads of mosquitoes that infested the place-stung to the quick by the
                  appearance of things in general, and the loss of his money in particular-he rushed
                  for our office, offering to return the lots for $600-this the "Col."
                  Gladly (?) assented to-the deeds were cancelled, and the "captain" walked off-the
                  first and the last man that was ever known to have even realized a
                     portion of the money invested in this "scheme." Many laughable,
                  many strange and serious, incidents and adventures, I passed through during these
                  early days of my California experience-but writing, as I am now doing entirely
                  from memory, aided only by some printed matter, and a few stray items in
                  manuscript that I have preserved, renders it somewhat difficult to transfer them
                  to paper.
            
            
               XXVII.
               FIRST CONCERT GIVEN IN CALIFORNIA.
               IN the month of June, 1849, some of my New York friends advised me to give an
                  entertainment-there being at this time no place of amusement of any sort open in
                  San Francisco. It was my first essay to appear in a monologue performance, and as
                  it was the first public entertainment of any sort or kind on the Pacific coast, I
                  think it may be entitled to a brief space in these my "adventures." The "Annals of
                  San Francisco" gives the following in relation thereto:
               "On Monday evening, June 22d, 1849, a concert of vocal music was performed at the
                  old school-room on the southwest corner of the plaza, and this may probably be
                  regarded as first among the regular amusements of San Francisco. It was given,
                  entirely unassisted, by Mr. Stephen C. Massett, at the suggestion of many of his
                  New York friends. The little room was crowded to suffocation, the proceeds
                  yielding the vocalist over five hundred dollars. The following is the programme, a
                  curiosity well worthy of preservation, printed at the office of the 'Alta
                  California,' then the only paper in the city. 'Front seats,' it will be observed,
                  were reserved for ladies, of whom there were but four present. The
                  piano used (we believe there was only one in the country) upon the
                  occasion, was loaned by Mr. E. Harrison, the collector of the port, and sixteen
                  dollars were paid for removing it from the custom-house to the school-room,
                  situated on opposite sides of Portsmouth Square."

               XXVIII.
               I AM MADE (LORD) MAYOR OF N. Y. OF THE PACIFIC.
               IN looking over some old papers recently, I found my "Commission" as "Alcalde,"
                  "Notary Public," and Commissioner of Deeds for New York of the Pacific. Here is a
                  copy-
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Know all men by these Presents, that I Bennet Riley, Brevet Brigadier
                              General, U. S. A., and Governor of California, by virtue of authority
                              in me vested, do hereby appoint and confirm Stephen C. Massett as
                              Alcalde in and for the 'City of New York of the Pacific' in the State
                              of California, and also a 'Notary Public" and 'Commissioner of Deeds'
                              for the same City and County, to date from the 1st day of July,
                              1849.
                           Given under my hand and seal at Monterey, Lower California, June 28,
                              1849.
                           
                              [Official]
                              B. RILEY, Bt. Brig. Gen. U. S. Army, and
                                 Governor of California.
                              H. W. HALLECK, Bt. Capt., and Secretary of
                                 State."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               This was the first, and in all probability will be the last position of the kind I
                  shall ever occupy. Those unacquainted with the definition of the word "Alcalde,"
                  are respectfully informed that it means the chief magistrate of a city. Added to
                  this the highly, important and lucrative offices of "Notary Public" and
                  "Commissioner of Deeds," were fairly thrust upon me!
               I began to feel the weight of office-and of course in a proportionate degree my
                  own importance!-and when a letter came to me (sent by some cruel wag! directed the
                  Hon. S. C. Massett, Alcalde, etc., I nearly fell off the stool.
               I was even seriously thinking of sending to London to get a pattern of the Lord
                  Mayor's gown-wig-sword and mace. I had fully intended to have had a "Lord
                     Mayor's show on the ninth of
                  November"-had settled upon the plan of my house-and determined upon engaging a
                  Lady Mayoress-but castles built on the air are one thing-and houses on N. Y. of
                  the Pacific are quite another-and when the reader is informed that of all the
                  houses-iron at that-which in the month of May, 1849, Col. Stevenson sent for from
                  New York to come "round the horn" or rather "in a horn"-not one up to this present
                  writing has arrived-and that those-I believe two in all-built by some unfortunate
                  wight-sank to rise no more, carrying owners and all with them, a few hours after
                  their erection; they will understand and duly appreciate the height of the
                  position from which I have fallen, and my indifference at the time to obey the
                  mandate of the Colonel, "to take up, my bed, and walk" to the scene of my future
                  labors.
               The reader was informed that when I landed in this wonderful city, I was the
                  fortunate possessor of six dollars in current coin. Five dollars of this vanished
                  in a meal for "two," at the Excelsior Restaurant, immediately upon our arrival-and
                  if you would like to know why I invested so large a proportion of my capital, I
                  reply that the most ordinary meal cost two dollars-that eggs were a dollar
                  a-piece-that coffee was fifty cents a cup, and therefore, under the circumstances,
                  the meal for myself and companion (considering our hungry state) was not so
                  enormous. It will hardly be believed at the present day, that such prices were
                  asked, and readily paid by the "new comers;" but having, fortunately for my own
                  veracity, (voracity I think I ought to say) a real Simon Pare bill of fare of one
                  of the then principal eating-houses of San Francisco-I present it
                  entire, if only to certify to the correctness of my assertion.

               So endeth the bill of fare-and I will bet such another is not to be seen for the
                  next hundred years.
               The restaurant was always filled, and nobody went away without paying, though it
                  is evident from a casual inspection of the above precious document, that an
                     ordinary dinner for a gentleman of
                  respectable appetite would have cost about ten dollars! I have heard it remarked
                  that there was about this time extraordinary dissipation to be every day witnessed
                  in and about the streets of San Francisco. The causes that led to it are not,
                  however, generally known-the above bill may throw a little light upon the subject.
                  What a temptation was offered to a man of slender means to procure a bottle of
                  brandy at a dollar, and becoming intensely drunk thereon-to forget his hunger and
                  purity together! Many a man could not afford to eat dinner in those days, and
                  there can be no doubt that many unfortunates took to drinking brandy to calm the
                  pangs of hunger, which they could not allay in a legitimate manner.
               I was introduced by Col. Stevenson upon one occasion to Mr. Samuel Brannan, now
                  one of, if not the most wealthy, citizens of that state, and at his suggestion,
                  and promise that I should act as "auctioneer" on the contemplated sale of his
                  large stock of goods at the "embarcadero," I left the Bay for its sister city,
                  Sacramento.
               In those days, the river bearing that name was navigated by "schooners," open
                  boats, etc., no luxuriant steamers at that early period were to be seen. So
                  packing up my "duds," and engaging a passage in the schooner, "Water Witch," for
                  $25, I left a "Clarke's Point" for a new scene of labor.
               Arriving at Sacramento City in about six days (it is now done in ten hours) tired
                  out and miserable, I sought the comforts of a "bath," and a "lay down."
               The bath was accomplished by a "ducking" at even-tide in the river, after which I
                  shouldered my trunk with a dozen others, having been directed to a "lodging-house"
                  called the "City Hotel," which was then nearly completed, and as I think it might
                  interest the present generation in general, and the keepers of taverns in
                  particular, to see the style of accommodation, I propose to give a sketch of the
                  interior of my sleeping apartment.
               Here it is. I think mine was the corner "bunk," and if the reader will kindly look
                  at the expression of my face, he or she will discover that I was not exactly lying
                  upon a bed of roses.

               
                   
               
               The heat was insufferable, mosquitoes were buzzing about, and with their slow
                  though sure attendants, fleas, and bed-bugs came in myriads to greet and
                  congratulate me upon my arrival. Scratching and itching, itching and scratching,
                  kept me pretty well awake all night; and then the stifled smell-the noise inside
                  and out-the swearing and snoring of the occupants, the barking of dogs, the
                  leaving of numberless trains of mules and donkeys outside, the cries of children,
                  rendered the scene a perfect pandemonium-and to crown the whole, just as I had
                  managed from sheer exhaustion to "drop off into a doze," I felt a heavy bump come
                  up against the slender board that screened me from the street-when to my
                  astonishment the head of a big ox presented itself, and with its cold and moist
                  snout commenced rubbing against my knee!
               I couldn't stand this any longer, and I leaped from my "slat" in the second
                  tier.
               I walked about till early daylight. But I soon found put that this was not the
                  place to grumble or complain, or in fact to be surprised, disgusted, or astonished
                  at anything, and I quickly went to work to establish myself as "Auctioneer."
               A Mr. Montgomery had got "ahead of me" in the sale of "Brannan's store," he having
                  offered to do it at a very low per
                  centage-and thus the first chance of holding the hammer was taken from me.
               I was, however, that day introduced to a Mr. Charles O. Brewster, who had then
                  recently arrived from Boston, and in less time almost than it takes me to write
                  these lines-an article of agreement was made out-our "Store" taken and leased-and
                  I was busy painting our sign!
               In those days everybody was crazy-money came and went-went and came-you knew not
                  how and cared not where-from morning till night it was one scene of excitement and
                  frenzy! Swearing, grumbling, drinking, and almost everybody rushing to the
                  diggings-gamblers occupied every tent (houses there were none), and shanties where
                  liquor of the vilest kind was sold at fifty cents per glass, and piles of Mexican
                  ounces and silver coin covered the tables, thousands of dollars were lost and won
                  in a single night, quiet there was none-and every one had at least to appear to
                  take part in the general excitement.
            
            
               XXIX.
               THE AUCTION HOUSE OF MASSETT AND BREWSTER.
               THE shanty on J street that we had hired for three hundred dollars per month,
                  looked more like a stable than an "Auction house," and had been occupied as a
                  bar-room by a "Monte" dealer.
               With the purchase (including the good "will" and fixtures), we were the possessors
                  of the remains of a once well stocked bar, and here I kept "open house" until our
                  stock of liquors had vanished; the remaining "traps" we resolved to sell at
                  auction.
               My partner C. O. B. then went to the "Bay" to make some purchases of goods which
                  we intended "offering" at night auction.
               In the course of time, the goods arrived, and having painted "Night Auction" on a
                  piece of calico, tacked it on a frame in the shape of a cocked hat, and stuck a
                  candle inside side, I stood at the door, and rang a bell, at the same time
                  informing the "outsiders" that I was just a "going to begin" to "open" the rarest
                  and richest stock of goods fresh arrived from S. F., and begged them to walk
                  in.
               The profits were enormous; I think our first venture was for about $1,000. We made
                  about $2,000 on the purchase. The first night auction was quite an event. The
                  little room was filled in every corner; the stock offered consisted in part of
                  "Pea-jackets," blankets, socks, boots, shoes, etc. The greatest "swindle" I think
                  on the present occasion was this: a young "Muchacho" fresh from the diggings came
                  up to the counter, and pointing to a paper of "Jews' harps," asked the price of
                  one (they cost about one dollar a gross), at the same time offering me a chunk of
                  gold for it, weighing at least eight dollars-I of course took it-it was a
                  legitimate trade-and he went on his way perfectly delighted.
               Among those who composed my audience upon this my first appearance, and who if
                  they ever read these lines will laugh, I know!-were Judge M--, Mr. P--, J. T. E--,
                  Professor S--, Dr. D--, and others. It will scarcely be believed, but upon these
                  occasions our profits were never less than one hundred dollars a night, and yet
                  such was the insanity of the times, we did not think this was making money fast
                  enough, and gave it up, to devote ourselves exclusively to "our day-sales."
               The first really important one that we made, was at the far-famed "Sutter's Fort,"
                  where the gallant Captain Sutter resided with his Indians, at the time of the
                  discovery of the gold. The Fort was about two miles from the city, and at the time
                  of which I am writing was one of the "Institutions" of the place.
               I had been introduced to a jolly fat and burly looking little Englishman, named
                  Tom W--, who acted as overseer, and head man of the Captain's at the fort, and the
                  Captain having concluded to sell out his stock of merchandise, I was selected by
                  his agent "Captain Thomas White" to do the "auctioneering" upon the occasion.
               We had "billed" the city pretty well, for several days previous to the "sale," I
                  and my partner going from one end of the town to the other, I with "tacks and
                  hammer" with the bills-which had been written by me in "very large letters," telling the public in general, that
                  on the first of October, a large sale would take place in the above locality. The
                  day was oppressively hot, and therefore the firm of "Massett and Brewster" took
                  the precaution to leave their "Sale-rooms"-big word that considering the premises
                  looked more like a large sized pigs' sty-at an early hour in the morning,
                  judiciously dropping here and there a brief catalogue of the particulars.
               Upon arriving at the Fort, I found my friend White had duly arranged the entire
                  stock into lots, requesting me to "put through" or "hurry up" the "truck," fancy
                  articles, and light goods, first reserving for the last part of the sale the heavy
                  goods, such as flour, clothing, &c.
               The buyers were an extraordinary-looking set, and in no other part of the world
                  would their word have been taken for a cent.
               I mounted a high stand, and with hammer in hand commenced. I am not going to laud
                  my performances in the auctioneering line-my well-known natural modesty would
                  prevent it, if nothing else would; but it was patent in Sacramento and in San
                  Francisco, that at any rate I kept my customers or buyers in good humor, generally
                  winding up my sales by an imitation of the celebrated razor-strop man, Mr. John
                  Smith (now of the Bowery).
               Upon the present occasion I had rattled through an innumerable quantity of
                  articles varied and strange. The audience had certainly got stuck
                  with molasses, filled with sausages, warmed with tea and
                  coffee, sweetened with sugar, and tight with gin and brandy. I then came to the
                  flour, of which there were some three hundred sacks.
               I was to put them up in lots of ten, with the privilege of the
                     whole. I was directed to get, if possible, the cost,
                  eleven dollars and a quarter for a hundred-pound sack, and not to let it go under
                     ten. Now it was thought that flour would "go up" to a very high
                  figure; there was very little in the market, and many in that crowd would have
                  liked to be the owners of the whole.
               "Now then, gentlemen, we come 'on to' the flour. I shall put it up in lots of five
                  sacks, with the privilege, &c. You are all aware of the present scarcity of
                  this article-the staff of life,' gentlemen, as the Psalmist, I believe, calls it.
                  Gentlemen, it's a solemn fact that 'flour's rising.' Yes, gentlemen, before thirty
                  days are over our heads, loaves (without even fishes) will be selling at a dollar
                  apiece, (I paid fifty cents this morning, gentlemen, for a
                  half-quartern!) You can't eat your gold dust, gentlemen. You
                     must have flour. So what's offered for the first sack of a hundred
                  pounds? Give me a bid, if you please. (Five dollars was offered.)
                  Five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five-half, half, half, half, half,-narf,
                  narf, narf, narf, narf, narf, narf. Gentlemen, this will never do. Six, six, six,
                  six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six,-cutter, cutter,
                  cutter,-narf, narf, narf, narf, narf, narf, narf, narf, narf,-seven, seven, seven,
                  seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven. I cannot
                  throw it away at this figure. Say eight. Eight I got."
               "Nine," shouted another, and "narf, narf, narf, narf,-cutter, cutter, cutter,
                  cutter, cutter."
               "Ten," called out an old cock, who insisted on my knocking him down; adding that
                  he didn't wish to be kept all day.
               Now I was determined, if possible, to get, at any rate for one lot,
                  the specified figure (one and a quarter), and I went on, regardless of the
                  suggestions or advices of the crowd; and though it was pretty hard work, and what
                  with the heat inside and the tedious nature of the sale, there being an immense
                  amount of goods yet unsold, I was glad to get the first lot off,-by
                  dint of great persuasion, and an extra amount of "gas," (an auctioneer's undoubted
                  prerogative,) I managed to get up to the wished for figure of "eleven dollars and
                  a quarter" for a one-hundred pound sack. This was a big draw on my lungs, and with
                  the perspiration streaming from every pore, I inquired, "How many will you take,
                  sir?" fully believing I had again to go through the same rigmarole of flowery
                  language for the balance of the lot,-when, to my utter astonishment, and indeed to
                  the surprise of everybody, the man called out, "I'll take the lot!"
               I looked at my man, who resembled more an escaped convict than a purchaser of
                  anything. I looked at my partner, Charles B. (who was shaking from head to foot
                  with the chills and fever), who nodded that it was all right; when I, asking the name of the buyer, he replied,
                  "Wolfe." I thought it was somewhat significant. I found out afterwards that he was
                  the owner of the "City Bakery," had foreseen that flour would very soon be in
                  great demand, and had bought up all he could. In connexion with this purchase, I
                  will simply state that he realized, in less than three months, $10,000 from this
                  investment, with which he returned to his home in the (y)East.
               Two other incidents connected with this somewhat remarkable sale, I will briefly
                  mention.
               There were some four hundred pairs of high boots, russian leather, that I knocked
                  down to a man at four dollars a pair. In less than two months (the heavy rains
                  having set in), he retailed them at one and two ounces ($16 and $32) per pair,
                  making more than $10,000 by his speculation.
               I wound up the day's work by selling a live pig for $65. The animal was a fine
                  English porker, and extremely vicious; a stout cord was attached to his leg, and
                  it was with the greatest difficulty that I could keep him in a steady position. He
                  evidently felt and appreciated the hornets' nest he had got into; for as I was
                  suggesting to my delighted audience that for the ridiculously small price at which
                  I was instructed by my employees to allow the pig to "slide," their memories of
                  the old homestead might be refreshed and their hearts made glad by the delicious
                  fragrance of a roast leg of pork with s age and onions! The pig, with a
                  w-heeeeeeeekk wwekkkkee, gave a start, breaking the string, knocking down one or
                  two of the crowd, and upsetting me in the bargain. He was retaken, and purchased,
                  I believe, by the Baptist minister, the Rev. Mr. C., who was at that time the only
                  professed butcher the city could boast of. This pig (whether male or female I have
                  forgotten) was litter-ally the nucleus of his (the parson's) fortune;
                  for having introduced it to one of the opposite gender, the consequence was, in
                  the proper course of time, a large yield of juvenile porkies that realized for him
                  an unheard-of price. And he often told me that the purchase of the Sutter's Fort
                  pig was the first streak of fat luck he had received. His store on I street was
                  frequently visited by me for a beefsteak or chop, or a nice fresh salmon mon, for
                  he was a fishmonger also; and though he was very assiduous in killing and cutting
                  all the week, he reserved Sunday for the saving and curing of souls!
               
               The amount of this day's sales was $15,000; our commission was ten per cent.,
                  making a profit of $1,500 for the firm of Massett and Brewster. This, for a five
                  hours' job, was pretty well.
               I usually wound up my sale of each article with the words (after "once, twice,
                  three times,") "Spizeruktum bang;" and for a long time I was known by no other
                  name.
               I officiated as auctioneer in several very large sales of real estate, in and out
                  of the city. In those days the firm of "Priest, Lee, & Co.," were the great
                  land-owners, bankers, and merchants. They were our landlords, and consequently I
                  was always the auctioneer selected by them whenever they put any of their city
                  lots "into the market." Money was fairly pouring in upon us. We purchased real
                  estate, and began to look upon ourselves as belonging to the "heavy men" of this
                  new and flourishing city.
               A proposition was about this time started to form an Episcopal church, and I was
                  invited to be one of the "wardens," and I began to fancy how my name would look, a
                  hundred years from thence, on the tablet over the church-door "Toney Hoope," the
                  facetious "Baron Vaux," was another "warden," and went to church regularly.
                  Speculations in land about this time were at fever-heat-whole cities were
                  frequently sold by me before dinnertime, and this was the style:
               A man would buy a tract of land or a "rancho" for perhaps $1000 or so-he would
                  then have it staked out or cut up into "lots," call it a city-get some draughtsmen
                  to make beautiful and gaudy maps thereof, insist that it was either the "head of
                  navigation," or the nearest route to the best diggings-unsurpassed for
                  agricultural purposes, and so on.
               One instance I well remember-the place was called "Butte City," I believe the
                  original cost was $1000. I was directed to sell as many lots as I possibly could
                  at that figure per lot, and I think the embryo city yielded the
                  fortunate speculator about $20,000-the reader need not be informed that the place was then, is now, and ever
                  will be, a barren waste-world without end-amen!
               Upon another occasion I was requested to sell "several hundred head of wild
                  cattle," in "bands" of forty each-this was a somewhat novel proceeding-but having
                  stated to my audience, as clearly as I could, the conditions of sale, and that the
                  animals were roaming at large, and had to be caught by the purchasers, they
                  commenced to bid. I was told to get ten dollars a head-the sale lasted about half
                  an hour-and our commissions were over $500.
            
            
               XXX.
               A JOLLY DINNER.
               THE interior of our little store was at times certainly a "curiosity," for be it
                  known to thee, my gentle reader, that the firm of Massett and Brewster did their
                  own cooking, made their own beds-fetched their own water-swept their own store-and
                  indeed officiated generally.
               We had bought a little stove, and for it we had paid seventy-five dollars (it
                  could be bought to-day for two dollars and fifty cents), had furnished ourselves
                  with some crockery, the remains of a sale we had made of several crates thereof
                  (an auctioneer's perquisites), and I determined to give a "blow-out" to one or two
                  old New York friends. Tone Bleecker, if he ever reads these lines, will remember
                  the occasion. The rain was coming down in torrents-the first rain of the season,
                  and our shanty not being waterproof, commenced to leak,-this very much interfering
                  with our cooking operations.
               I had sallied out to purchase two or three cans of preserved chicken, for this I
                  paid four dollars a can-a pound of onions cost one dollar, and potatoes the same
                  amount; two loaves of bread one dollar; four bottles of porter, two dollars each,
                  ($8.) (Though our friend, Elijah W-- did prig a couple from W. M--'s
                  store next door, and like a good fellow, handed it to me "over the wall!") and a
                  lot of cigars at fifty cents apiece.

               A fire was quickly built-the contents of the cans, emptied into a bran new
                  saucepan-the onions peeled, and potatoes washed and cut in slices-well peppered
                  and salted-and I acting as cook-sat eagerly watching the simmering
                  and boiling thereof. I had almost forgot to mention that I had cut across the
                  street to my friend, the Rev. Mr. C--, the Baptist minister, who looked after the
                  sheep-and coaxed him out of a small piece of English bacon, which I duly cut into
                  slices to give our stew a "flavor." I had likewise found out on the shelf of my
                  friend's store next door, some preserved parsley!-this succulent and juicy
                  concoction was immediately sprinkled with the fragrant herb-and the aroma rising
                  from the home-made dish, not only tickled the olfactories of every one present,
                  but called forth the remark from my amiable partner, that I had evidently mistaken
                  my vocation-for that as a "cook," I should certainly make a sensation. Every now
                  and then I would lift up the lid of the saucepan, and give the contents a good
                  stir, with a large tin spoon, used generally in ladling our gold-dust,-in answer
                  to the bubbling, seething, and rumbling sound of the precious mixture, as if in a
                  stew to be taken off, a fork was inserted into the potatoes, and they were
                  pronounced "done,"-flakes of chicken, that had left the bones in disgust, jostled
                  by slices of onion, swam about in as rich, fine, and well seasoned a sea of broth,
                  as ever tempted the palate of a London alderman, at a Lord Mayor's dinner. The
                  covers removed, the steam rose in clouds, and the contents were emptied into a
                  large wooden bowl, which had seen good service, and we sat down to do justice to
                  the "dish." Did anything ever taste quite as nice as that chicken-stew? I think
                  not-and then washed down by the real old genuine "brown stout,"-the rain was
                  pouring down outside, making it all the cozier within-but what with the heat from
                  the stove, the smallness of the apartment, and the excitement of eating and
                  drinking, and the want of ventilation, the place was insufferably warm. Some one
                  suggested that We should open the door-at this moment, a gust of wind gave us a
                  look-in, and in the eagerness of its congratulations, and in a very unceremonious
                  manner, with one puff, upset our rickety table, with its entire contents, of
                     dishes, plates, pans, and the
                  remains of the "soup," porter, etc.-A general stampede occurred somewhat similar
                  to the banqueting scene when Lady Macbeth, seeing the shaky-ness of her lord and
                  master, requests her "guests" to cut and run-and the last I saw of Tony B-- was
                  the end of his coat-tail, he flying before the wind chasing his sombrero, which
                  had left his head in a hurry on gaining the street. Upon being left alone, we
                  cleared up matters and things as well as possible, and prepared our sleeping
                  apparatus. I had a "hammock" hung for an occasional visitor-I sleeping on the
                  "counter," and immediately underneath the aforesaid "hammock." An old Boston
                  friend, Steve T--, was the occupant of the last mentioned article; and he had just
                  succeeded, after innumerable gymnastic efforts, and sundry jerkings and pullings,
                  to get inside of it-when the rocking consequent upon its occupancy, and the
                  frequent potations and imbibitions of varieties of liquor, acted as a delightful
                  narcotic, and a prolonged but not at all soft or euphonous snore gave token that
                  he was revelling in the land of dreams. Now, however soothing and delightful to
                  the sleeper this nasal accomplishment may be; it is not at all appreciated by
                  those who are "wide awake,"-accordingly, I administered a gentle kick in the
                  region of the back, that not only had the effect of stopping the noise, but of
                  bringing him and the hammock right on the top of me!-having first been well
                  saturated with water, doubtless from the leakiness of the roof. This came with a
                  heavy weight upon me, my friend's "heft" being over 200 pounds-and I hardly know
                  which of us was the most astonished or hurt.
               It had the effect, however, of restoring him to consciousness and sobriety, and
                  after having a hearty laugh over the adventures of the day and night, we composed
                  ourselves again to sleep.
               The flourishing condition of the firm of M. and B. was such that we determined to
                  make the purchase of the lot we then occupied. Its dimensions were twenty by
                  eighty, and the price $5,000. The deeds were drawn-the money paid-and we went on
                     swimmingly-as the saying is-and the reader shall know in a very
                  short time the applicability of this italicised word.
            
            

               XXXI.
               THE FIRST THEATRICAL REPRESENTATION IN SACRAMENTO.
               IN the latter part of the year 1849, the first theatrical representation took
                  place in this city, at what was then called the Eagle Theatre on; street. It was a
                  frame building covered with canvas, and though only composed of this slight
                  material, it cost over $30,000, lumber being at that time over $500 a thousand
                  feet. The prices were five dollars to the boxes, and three dollars to the pit.
               On the opening night, which I shall not easily forget, having returned from a
                  lengthened stroll in and around about Sutter's Fort with Mr. Bayard Taylor, I
                  proceeded in his company to the pasteboard Temple of the Muses.
               It had been raining hard, and blowing a gale of wind the whole day, and the
                  strength and durability of the building had been sorely tried; however, as the
                  hour drew near for the opening of the doors, crowds of anxious miners thronged the
                  entrance, and despite the winds and torrents of rain, the place was immediately
                  filled. By the time we arrived we found that those who were fortunate enough to
                  have secured "pit tickets," had the pleasure of enjoying a "fresh water bath" for
                  the same money (a luxury unknown almost in those days, as people rarely washed
                  themselves), for by that time the water was on a level with the seats; but the
                  theatrical fire raged entirely too high to be put out by any such hydraulic
                  arrangement as this, and accordingly the curtain rose at the conclusion of the
                  overture to the "Bronze Horse"-the orchestra consisting of the fiddle-a very
                  cheezy flageolet, played by a gentleman with one eye-a big drum, and a triangle,
                  that served the double purpose of ringing in the boarders to their meals at the
                  restaurant next door. The play was the "Bandit Chief" or "Forest Spectre," in
                  which, as the bills said, the celebrated female Tragedian Mrs. R--, from the
                  Theatre Royal, New Zealand, would make her first appearance in California as the
                  heroine. For this performance she received about one hundred and fifty dollars per
                     night- and to give some idea of the
                  classical style of the lady's pronunciation she replied, upon the question being
                  asked her if she would accept the hand of the bandit chief:
               "Is art is as ard as a stone-and I'd rayther take a basilisk, and rap is cold
                  fangs areound me-than surrender meself to the cold himbraces of a artless
                  willain!"
               The bills announced that the performance would conclude with the thrilling and
                  affecting Tragedy of "Douglas," the part of "Norval" by a gentleman who had been
                  unfortunate at the diggings, and had only recently found out the proper channel in
                  which to display his genius. He delivered the celebrated speech 
                     "MY NAME IS NORVAL,"
                   assisted audibly by the prompter, in the following strange manner, amid the
                  shoutings, and roars of laughter of the entire house.
               
                  "My name is Norval-on the Grampian hills,
                  My father feeds his flocks a frugal swan-
               
               
                  Prompter. Swain you booby.
               
                  Swain you booby, whose constant care was
                  To increase his shop-
               
               
                  Prompter. Store-Sir-What are you doing?
               
               
                  "Store sir, what are you doing-and keep his only son myself at home-
                  For I had heard of battles, and I longed
                  To follow to the fields some warlike lord-
                  And heaven soon granted, what my sire desired-

                  Bow, and quivering full of arrows-

                  Spoil encumbered foe, I meant you stupid ass-and having heard

               XXXII.
               THE FLOOD OF 1849 AND '50.
               THIS will be well remembered by all the old residents of Sacramento.
               It had been raining fearfully for many days, and the Sacramento river was rapidly
                  rising; the lower portion of the city was entirely under water, and our store had
                  about two feet "in the hold." The utmost consternation prevailed; and towards
                  nightfall a perfect panic had seized the citizens, and naught appeared visible but
                  the tops of the houses, with a swarm of human beings on the roofs.
               Luckily, at the Levee there were moored some ships, barks, and schooners, that had
                  been emptied of their cargoes and passengers; to these the women first were
                  carried in boats and rafts, and indeed every imaginable conveyance was resorted
                  to; street was one mass of water-no speck of land was anywhere visible. We had
                  vacated our store long since in boats, and I had the felicity of seeing a trunk
                  full of new shirts, recently received from New York, floating down the stream,
                  together with numberless other movables. I and one or two others, having by hook
                  or by crook got hold of a boat, it was suggested that we should pull up in the
                  vicinity of Dr. W.'s, situated in the upper part of the city, having ascertained
                  that the ladies of the household were entirely at the mercy of the elements, and
                  unable to leave their "ocean-bound" residence.
               Arriving there, we found the house deserted, our boat walking straight into the
                  drawing-room, and coming bump up against the legs of the piano (the water touching
                  the keys thereof), when, to my astonishment, I found several of my songs floating
                  on the top, and one in particular I thought was now in its proper
                  element-that was, "When the Moon on the Lake is beaming."
               Away again down; street, bump we went against the stump of a tree-then slap into a
                  boat-both upset-got a duck in consequence, which we duly cooked; for, strange as
                  it may seem, and scarce as every kind of fowl was in those days, a solitary duck,
                  in the style of "James's horseman," was taking a stroll down the street, when he
                  was thus taken by storm. Whole families were passing on rafts-others on the back
                  of a cow; and although everybody appeared to think that a second edition of the
                  Deluge had arrived, and a Noah's ark the thing to erect, yet everybody seemed
                  jolly, and thought it a good joke.
               Some of my friends proposed to me to give a concert on the water, and talked of
                  Handel's water music; but I was compelled to refuse them, after many vain attempts
                  to anchor a boat alongside the key-board of one of Waters's pianos.
               
                   
               
               The scene at night time was truly exciting.
               The full moon, like a big ball of molten silver, shone forth with an unusual
                  brilliancy from its home in the heavens, surrounded by its twinkling and
                  glittering companions, the stars. One vast sheet of water lay beneath, reflecting
                  the bright flashings of the jewelled firmament; and, excepting here and there a
                  faint light from the house tops or from the masts of the shipping in the river, there was no
                  sign of life or humanity! It was a repetition of the first flood, sure. Patches of
                  feathery clouds, fanned by a stiff breeze, sailed to and fro in the sky; and the
                  leafless branches of the big trees, with their bare and uplifted arms, shook with
                  the north wind's piping.
               Morning came, and from my little window in the cock-loft of the French Hotel, the
                  room of which I had reached by the aid of a boat and a big ladder, the scene was
                  equally exciting, and even comical. Merchandise of every variety and description
                  was "afloat;" rafts and boats, filled with property, and swarming with live
                  freight, filled the streets; those persons who were lucky enough to own a house,
                  lived and slept on the roof-cooked on the roof-made calls on the roof-drank on the
                  roof-prayed on the roof-laughed and joked on the roof-sang on the roof-took a bath
                  on the roof-cursed the gold fields on the roof-wished they were back in New York
                  on the roof-got married on the roof-went to church on the roof-wrote letters on
                  the roof-and thought they'd never get off the roof.
               But they did!-and such a stampede was never seen. Property went up as the men and
                  women got down-and the waters fell; and to show the insanity that possessed
                  everybody, myself among the number, at this period, at a sale of real estate by
                  Col. J. B. Starr, I bought a piece of land, covered by one foot of
                     water, for which I paid $1000 in gold dust, and which I subsequently
                  parted with for thirty dollars!
               
               The waters of the Sacramento river fell gradually lower and lower, and in a few
                  days terra firma was again visible. The flood, however, had given me a general
                  disgust for the place, and I accordingly made, up my mind to "locate" myself in
                  San Francisco.
               Accordingly, the firm of Massett and Brewster was dissolved (as the papers always
                  announce) by mutual consent. And here let me pay a passing tribute to my valued
                  and respected friend; for a more honorable man and delightful companion, I have
                  not met with in my wanderings; and I am happy likewise, en
                     passant, to mention, that he is not only a flourishing merchant in
                  the City of Brotherly Love, but (very unlike his original partner) a
                  happy Benedict, with a whole lot of little fledglings. Long may they wave!
               I had taken a lease of a store on Jackson street, owned by Lewis & Co., and
                  very shortly afterwards the citizens of San Francisco were startled with the
                  ringing of a big bell, and the walls covered with bills, announcing the fact that
                  I was about to sell some real estate on the public plaza.
               It was in this year that the celebrated pianist and composer, Henri Herz, visited
                  California, arriving hither from Mexico, where he had, it was reported, realized
                  fabulous sums of money. His concerts in San Francisco were crowded; and upon his
                  trip to Sacramento, I happening to be upon the same steamer, and having met him
                  previously in New York at our old friend Adam Stodart's, he proposed that I should
                  sing for him, and asked me what my "terms" were.
               Now I had given the first concert entirety by myself in this golden land, and one
                  or two others besides, and generally pocketed four or five hundred dollars a
                  night; and so I asked my friend from Paris five hundred pesos. He stared aghast,
                  and said he couldn't stand it; but, however, at the solicitation of my friend Mr.
                  F. C. Ewer, (now the Rev. F. C. Ewer, of this city,) the then editor
                  of the Sacramento Transcript, I "concluded" to sing for two hundred dollars a
                  night. (Pretty good pay now, I think.) The price of tickets was seven dollars and
                  four dollars, and the house, at that, was crowded.
               A funny incident occurred at Herz's concert, that was greatly enjoyed by the
                  pianist and the audience also.
               In obedience to an encore in one of my songs I was requested to give the comic
                  recitation of the "Frenchman and the Rats."
               A somewhat laughable little sketch illustrating the difficulties of a Frenchman in
                  his peregrinations in an English country town, and his being aroused from his
                  slumbers by the visit of a big rat gnawing at a piece of cheese that he had placed
                  under his pillow-case.
               When I had arrived at this point in the anecdote-two rats with very long tails ran
                  right across the stage, and a general scrambling of the same animal was heard on
                  the "cotton" ceiling. A roar of laughter arose from the audience ence-Herz being quite convulsed, and certainly up
                  to that time I had never given this much abused animal credit for possessing such
                  powers of ratiocination!
               A few nights after this, having been promised the assistance of a well known, and
                  delightfully genial and jolly fellow-Johnny Nichols, one of the then "merchant
                  princes" of this fast growing and flourishing city, I got out my programme. Coming
                  immediately after this well known celebrity, I felt it was a little "risky," but
                  then I thought the additional attraction of my friend "Johnny," as we all called
                  him, would certainly draw a large crowd.
               This was my first essay in Sacramento, and I was certainly anxious that it should
                  "go off" with eclat. Now, my friend, though he had often in private delighted the
                  ears of his listeners by his dulcet tones and refined taste in singing a ballad,
                  and often amused us by a peculiarly appreciative expression of his face, with his
                  head thrown back, a gentle swaying to and fro of the body, and a nervous twitching
                  of the thumb and finger-though, I say, often on the classic ground of K-- street,
                  where the "Salem" boys would congregate, and peddle to the delighted miners picks
                  at six dollars each, cans of preserved oysters for the same price, and other
                  articles in the same proportion-though here he was often heard, esteemed, and duly
                  appreciated-he had not "as yet" faced an audience in public.
               We had a rehearsal-and I remember it well-the song "Give me a Cot" was his
                  happiest effort, and though there were only half a dozen deal benches in the room,
                  without any sitters, and myself, the only one present, he said he felt his heart
                  come up in his mouth or his mouth in his heart, I forget which, and had the most
                  horrible forebodings as to the result of the evening. He offered me any money to
                  let him off, but I wouldn't consent, his name was in the bills, and I was
                  responsible for the performance taking place as per advertisements.
               He explained to me that he had eaten nothing for a week, in simply anticipating
                  the dread event, that the bare thought of this being the fatal night made him
                  deathly sick, that hanging would even be a luxury, and that it was impossible to
                  sing upon an empty stomach!
               I obdurately refused to excuse him, insinuating that we should both be ruined in
                  reputation, looked upon as swindlers, and probably placed on board the "Prison
                  Brig."
               He replied that he would go to his store, lie down, try and take a nap, and a
                  cocktail, say his prayers, and be at hand at half past seven-the dread hour came,
                  eight o'clock came, and no "Johnny, "and no-"nothing." I don't know whether any of
                  my readers have felt the peculiar sensation experienced sometimes by public
                  performers in "waiting for somebody to come in;" if they have, they will
                  sympathize with me upon this occasion, sitting upon the stump of a big tree at the
                  lower end of M-- street in a drizzling shower of rain, underneath a Chinese
                  umbrella! Darkness reigned supreme, and excepting the feeble glimmering of a very
                  dismal and sickly looking oil lamp over the door of the hall, no light was
                  visible.
               In the dim distance a speck of light appeared, small, but brilliant as a firefly,
                  nearer, nearer, nearer it came. I arose to meet it, when to my delight I found it
                  was my companion in difficulties, "Johnny," with a big roll of music, a tin can
                  full of strong punch, and a large umbrella. He gave a faint smile as I greeted
                  him, and when in answer to his inquiry as to whether the hall was full, I answered
                  him that I believed it was, but felt too nervous to go and see, the effect upon
                  both of us was painfully visible.
               It was now past eight, and something had to be done. I was waited upon by the
                  Mayor of the city, assisted by Alderman Queen, and one of the Board of
                  Supervisors, who suggested that it was time for me "to open."
               I would readily have given at that moment all I possessed to have been a hundred
                  miles from the place.
               I was informed that three or four "lanterns" had just gone up stairs accompanied
                  by several ladies, and that there were nearly a hundred people in the room; this,
                  considering I had not seen a living soul, was a pretty good stroke of
                  legerdemain.
               "Johnny" crept slowly up the stairs, to deposit his traps, and prepare for the
                  event, and just as I was following him with a palpitating heart, he passed by me
                  at double quick time, remarking that he had left his music behind, and would return immediately. I think the
                  next time I saw my friend, was in Salem, Massachusetts, some three years
                  afterwards.
               I must do my friend the justice, however, to say, that he delegated a
                  distinguished pianist, Mr. George P--, now, I believe, one of the most successful
                  and brilliant performers on the Pacific coast, to play, at an enormous cost, one
                  of his compositions on the piano, which, in a measure, appeased the ire of the
                  expecting and somewhat disappointed audience.
               Now, as the reader will perceive, though in numbers the "crowd" was decidedly a
                  select one, the figure of admission was three dollars each, and the consequence
                  was I was nearly $300 in hand by the two hours' exertion.
            
            
               XXXIII.
               "GOING-GOING-GONE!" TO THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.
               UPON returning to San Francisco and finding business a little dull, I thought I
                  would take a run over to the Sandwich Islands, a distance of some eighteen hundred
                  or two thousand miles, I think, and generally accomplished in from ten to fourteen
                  days, taking the "trades" with us nearly all the way.
               I accordingly took passage in the schooner Emeline, Captain Howard (of New London,
                  Conn.), bound for Lahaina and Honolulu.
               One of the most delightful voyages of my life, was this trip to the Islands.
            
            

               XXXIV.
               THE WAY THEY CATCH WHALES IN THE PACIFIC.
               CAPTAIN HOWARD, of the schooner Emeline, was a first-rate specimen of a dry,
                  quaint, good-natured, deown-east skipper. He hailed, I believe, from New London,
                  and though in his earlier years he had been "a wailing," he had not (to use his
                  own expression) seen the "darned thing speout" for many a long day.
               It was a lovely evening in June, and the bright red sun had just dipped its
                  flaming body in the western horizon, leaving the sky one sheet of the most
                  dazzling crimson, while fleecy clouds, tipped with every variety of gorgeous
                  coloring, followed in its wake, and sailed along the heavens-sapphire, green,
                  purple, orange, blue, and yellow commingled together in wondrous harmony-making a
                  sunset rarely seen in other than the Pacific waters. The day had been intensely
                  hot, and a deliciously cool three or four knot breeze was carrying us to our
                  destined port, and I and the skipper lounging in a hammock that had been swung for
                  us on the upper deck.
               Turning to me suddenly, he cried out, "There she blows!"
               "Who's she?" says I.
               "Why the whale, of course," says he; "don't you see that thing a speouting?"
               I looked, and saw in the distance, for the first time in my life, one of these sea
                  monsters.
               "Did you ever hear how they ketch them fellers?" said the skipper.
               I confessed my entire ignorance of the modus operandi, at the same time expressing
                  the greatest desire to be informed of the method by one who had been in the
                  business.
               "Wall," says he, first giving a huge plug of tobacco a good twist in his mouth,
                  "you must know that some years ago I sailed from New London with a man named
                     Capting Bissum. It was my first
                  voyage, and I often hoped, afore I got back, it would be my last. We'd been eout
                  abeout two years without seeing a thing, and I'd had nuthing to eat but salt pork
                  and hard bread full o' worms and uther animals, and had broke several teeth in
                  trying to get it through my head-when all of a sudden the man at the masthead sung
                  out,
               "'Thar she blows!'
               "I looked at Capting Bissum-Capting Bissum looked at me. He said nothin'-I said
                  nuthin'.
               "The man at the masthead sung out,
               "Thar-she-blows!'
               "I walked right up to Capting Bissum, and says I, 'Capting Bissum, shall I lower
                  away?' Says he, 'Simmons Howard-(that's my name, yer know)-if you sees fitten to
                  lower-lower and be d--!' Thereupon I did lower-and I says,
               "'Give way, boys, for 'ile's a rising.'
               "And I pulled right straight away up to the critter, and I shoved my harpoon just
                  abaft his blowers, and I guv him such a fluke, as settled him for life; and I cum
                  aboard, and Capting Bissum met me at the gangway with tears in his eyes-and says
                  he,
               "'Simmons Howard, you're a leetle of the smartest man as ever druv a harpoon in
                  these 'ere suthern seas. There's my t'baccy box and my pipe, at your sarvice for
                  the remainder of the woyage.'
               "Says I, 'Capting Bissum,' says I, 'I axes favors of no man. All I want is
                  ciwility, and that of the commonest kind.'
               "What d'ye think o' that?" says he, for a yarn.
               And we had a jolly good laugh at the recital.
               
                   
               
            
            

               XXXV.
               THE ISLAND OF LAHAINA.
               I THINK it was about the twelfth day out, that we neared the Island of Maui-of
                  which Lahaina is the principal city. The ostensible purport of the visit of the
                  schooner was for a cargo of potatoes and onions, these vegetables at that time
                  bringing fifteen and twenty cents a pound in San Francisco, and only costing two
                  cents there.
               As we neared the beach in the schooner's boat, hundreds of natives came swimming
                  towards us, throwing us fruit, etc.
               Just as I was gaining the shore, and had read the words "Custom House" in large
                  black letters on a very rickety-looking building, I heard a voice call out,
                  "There's Steve M--."
               This certainly had the effect of making me feel somewhat at home, and upon my
                  shaking hands with my friend in uniform, I found he was the acting U. S. Consul
                  there, Mr. Wm. Hubbard, once of Buffalo, who remembered me when at Nevin's-the
                  reader may remember how many years ago. We "homologated" at once-my trunks were
                  immediately transferred to his residence, which he informed me was used as the
                  country "palace" of the Queen, Kamehameha-and surely no lovelier or cooler spot
                  could have been selected, right on the shores of the Pacific, while groves of
                  cocoa-nut and orange-trees shielded you from the scorching rays of the sun in the
                  daytime.
               They had two very fair hotels, where you could be accommodated at one dollar per
                  diem, for board and bedding; but the plan generally adopted, I found out, was to
                  hire what they call a "Grass House." These cost only four dollars a month, and are
                  cool, and kept by the natives scrupulously clean; the furniture simply consisting
                  of a bamboo chair, a table, a bedstead, with a Chinese mat on it, and one thin
                  sheet, of course covered by a "mosquito net."
               
                  
                  LAHAINA.
                  I had heard much in my boyish days, both in England and the United States, of
                     the privations, the trials, the dangers, and the troubles of the "poor
                     missionary." Indeed, I recollect of a mahogany box with a brass plate on it,
                     that lay for years on my father's parlor table, with the significant words:
                        "For the Poor Heathen" engraved thereon-and as I would
                        very occasionally drop therein a heavy penny of the reign of
                     George the Third, and give the box a gentle shake, to see how much was in it, I
                     felt I had done something for the copper-colored race-and when at
                     "Exeter Hall," at the missionary meetings, at the May anniversaries, I would
                     gaze with astonishment, wonder, and almost holy reverence, as the chairman
                     would introduce the Rev. Mr. So and So, from the "Sandwich Islands," to the
                     audience. I little dreamed that I should revel in the luxuries of the delicious
                     climate from whence they came, or witness the content, elegance, and refinement
                     in which these self-sacrificing, disinterested, and sedate looking gentlemen
                     passed away their lives.
                  Upon one occasion I distinctly remember going down to the St. Katharine Dock,
                     in London, to witness the departure of some missionaries for the port of
                     Honolulu-and I felt an inward conviction that they were going to certain
                     death-that they would be cleaved right up immediately upon their arrival; and
                     when a facetious friend of mine, who had recently returned from that portion of
                     the globe, informed me, that at the hotel at which he stopped, he noticed one
                     day an extraordinary-looking dish, at one end of the table, and upon inquiring
                     its nomenclature, was informed it was "a piece of cold missionary," I shuddered
                     at the thought of their fool-hardiness, and invariably lauded their truly
                     Christian philanthropic and devotional intentions.
                  The Rev. Mr.-- of Lahaina, who had resided there at the date about which I am
                     writing, some twenty years ago-was not only very much respected and beloved by
                     his congregation, consisting of native men and women, but passed his days in
                     ease, quiet, and luxury; and I was informed had amassed quite a snug little
                     fortune; and I will here remark, not intending to pursue the subject further of
                     the good or evil effects of the Missionary system, that in all the countries I
                     have visited, the Missionary has been the most independent, has lived the most
                     luxuriously, and instead of his life being one of banishment and hardship, it
                     appeared to me to be one of tranquillity, competence, and ease.
                  Lahaina with its environs is certainly the principal point of attraction on the
                     Island of Maui, it being the only seaport of this portion of the Hawaiian
                     group.
                  The roadstead of this beautiful island in the spring and fall of the year is
                     filled with large whale ships, that have come in from the various cruising
                     grounds of the Pacific to recruit, where all kinds of supplies can be obtained
                     on more advantageous terms, and with less detriment to the men, than at any
                     other place in these waters.
                  The principal supplies, if I remember right, furnished by the natives, are
                     hogs, goats, fruit of all kinds, poultry, vegetables, and particularly Irish
                     potatoes, for which they receive money, cloth, etc., in exchange. Fresh beef is
                     somewhat hard to get.
                  The bathing, and diversions with the surf-board by the natives, are
                     particularly amusing. In the south part of the town, I used to wander when the
                     sea was rolling in heavily over the reef, and observe the evolutions and
                     wondrous rapidity of a set of surf-playing natives. The sport is immensely
                     attractive, and to the Hawaiians full of the wildest excitement-though
                     certainly I fancied to a novice it would be dangerous in the extreme.
                  As I witnessed this exciting and exhilarating amusement, how greatly I
                     regretted my inability to swim, or to get balanced on a board just before a
                     great big wave-and to be hurried in half a mile or so landward with racehorse
                     speed-all the time wrapt in spray and foam-and without letting the roller
                     break, and tumble over my head.
                  It seemed to me to require great strength of muscle to keep the head and
                     shoulders just ahead and clear of the great crested wall that seemed impending
                     over them-and threatening to bury the bold surf-rider in its watery ruin.
                  The natives perform this with wonderful intrepidity, skill, and daring-riding upon the neck and mane,
                     as if it were one of their furious chargers; and when you look to see them in
                     their swift course dashed upon the sand or rocks, they will just slip under the
                     belly of the wave they have ridden-and are away outside again, waiting for a
                     sail upon another.
                  On the Atlantic sea-board there is wanting the delicious temperature of the
                     water within these tropics, and I can conceive of nothing more exquisite than
                     laving the wearied limbs in its invigorating embraces.
                  Speaking of Lahaina, the Rev. Mr. Cheever in his capitally written works says:
                     "It is one of those places which you like much better as you approach or recede
                     from it, than when you are actually in it. A little way off it seems sweetly
                     embosomed in bread-fruit trees, and all fresh and lovely with sunshine and
                     verdure, calmly inclosed seaward within a fence of foam, made by the sea
                     breaking upon the coral reef. Ride over the rollers in a whale-boat or native
                     canoe, get to the sun-burnt, dusty land, walk up a few rods, perhaps with white
                     pantaloons, to the mission-houses, and make acquaintance on the way to your
                     heart's content with Lahaina dust and caloric, and you will probably by that
                     time be saying to yourself- 
                        'Twas distance lent enchantment to the view.
                     
                  
                  "However, dirt, fleas, mosquitoes, and heat to the contrary notwithstanding,
                     Lahaina has so salubrious and dry a climate, and advantages for healthful
                     sea-bathing all the year round, that one who is anything of an invalid likes to
                     be there, or, what is better, two miles above, at the seminary of Lahainaluna.
                     It is said that the greatest observed elevation of the mercury here in
                     Fahrenheit's thermometer, for ten years, was 86 deg.; the lowest, 54 deg. The
                     wind is the alternating land and sea breeze. A steep mountainous ridge in the
                     rear entirely breaks off the trades, and, receiving all their rain, carries it
                     distilled below in a fertilizing stream that irrigates all the valley and vega
                     of Lahaina, and is spent before it reaches the sea.
                  "Two or three times in a year the trades whirl over the mountain, and then woe
                     to the man's eyes that are so luckless less as to be found in it. From hill and
                     plain there are caught up great, suffocating volumes of red dust, that envelop
                     all the town, and even roll off to ships in the roadstead, and redden the sea.
                     Closed doors and windows are as mere lattice-work for it. It traverses stone
                     walls and adobes, human lungs and ears, and I
                     know not but livers, and permeates every thing. If a man's eye only escape
                     being filled and getting the ophthalmia, he is well off. But the blow is over,
                     all is well again. The sea or the translucent Lahainaluna water is there to
                     wash in, and, merrily making your ablutions within and without, you'll sing- 
                        
                           Cold water for me, cold water for me!
                           But wine for the tremulous debauchee!"
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               XXXVI.
               THE CITY OF HONOLULU, S. I.
               AFTER passing three or four weeks very delightfully here, I took passage in a
                  Government vessel for the city of Honolulu, the Capital of the Island of "Oahu,"
                  pronounced O-wy-hee.
               Two days I think brought us to our destined port. After delivering some letters of
                  introduction, and having had my traps taken to the United States Hotel, I strolled
                  with my friend S-- of the house of Makee Anthon & Co., (whom at this late day
                  I wish to thank for many acts of kindness and attention), to see a few of the
                  lions and lionesses.
               I believe, at the time of which I am writing, Honolulu had a population of about
                  20,000-the principal building at that time was the Custom House-quite an imposing
                  looking edifice of white stone. They also had a little theatre here, several
                  churches of various persuasions, and numbers of quite elegantly constructed
                  private dwellings. The varied scenery of the valley called Nuuanu, with its highly
                  cultivated cascades, cottages, and romantic mountain sides is beautiful in the extreme. I passed some
                  delightful hours at the residence of Dr. Judd, which he calls "Sweet Home"-and I
                  carry with me "pleasant memories" of the charming society and kind hospitality of
                  his wife and daughters.
               Now it was suggested to me that as there never yet had been a concert given at the
                  Islands, and as they had seen by the S. F. journals, that I had given several,
                  "unaided and unassisted," in California, I should accordingly inaugurate the
                  system there, and I was accordingly dubbed the "Captain Cook" of the tribe of
                  wandering minstrels.
               I was in a dilemma about a good piano, when upon being introduced to Mrs.
                  Patteson, the daughter of Mr. Allen the U. S. Consul, she most kindly loaned me
                  one of "Chickering's" celebrated "grand," which was duly carted to the place of
                  amusement.
               The night was oppressively hot, and the theatre crowded. The private boxes, of
                  which there were three, were reserved for the Royal party, consisting of the King,
                  Kammehameha, two or three Queens, and any number of Princes and Princesses. The
                  first (and only) tier was filled with the English and American portion of the
                  population, and the pit crammed with Kanakas, men, women, and children.
               
                   
               
               The performance had gone on smoothly enough until I came to the ballad of "The Old
                  Arm Chair," which I was requested to sing in response to an encore. Now, not
                  having ing then a very definite idea of the opinions entertained of my merits or
                  demerits by the native part of my auditory, I was quite unprepared for the
                  following incident, which for the moment upset my equilibrium, and threw the house
                  into roars of laughter. When feeling in pretty good trim, I have generally been
                  successful in operating upon the feelings or the nerves of some tender-hearted old
                  or young lady (as the case may be) in rendering the second stanza of this charming
                  composition of Eliza Cook, and upon the present occasion, this hydraulic
                  phenomenon having been witnessed by two or three of the Kanakas, they all stood
                  up, shook their fists at me, and gesticulating in the most extraordinary manner,
                  and jabbering in the native tongue, at the top of their voices, completely upset
                  everything for the moment. I stopped short, came to the front, and asked them what
                  they wished. "Oliolo hale kage, boo-boo, hokey-pokey, shaggy-baggy, male-halle,
                  poko-foko," they replied, pointing to the women who were crying upstairs. With
                  this they ran out of the building, and swore vengeance against me. I was told that
                  they thought by seeing the women in tears, that I had insulted them, and as they
                  were entirely in the dark as to the nature of the performance, devoid as it was of
                  anything particularly meretricious, they took this opportunity to vent their
                  indignation. Order was soon restored, and at the end of the entertainment, his
                  Majesty did me the honor to take some sherry wine with me, and invited me to the
                  Palace on the following day.
               The "Polynesian" had the following, in reference to the performance: 
                     MR. STEPHEN MASSETT, THE AMERICAN VOCALIST.-This gentleman's first
                        appearance at the Hawaiian Hall, last evening, was attended by His Majesty,
                        King Kammahamaha, and the principal English and American residents, who
                        appeared quite delighted with the rare and intellectual treat afforded them.
                        Mr. Massett was waited upon at the close of his performance by a number of
                        influential gentlemen, who requested him to defer his departure for a few
                        days, to enable them to enjoy a repetition of his ballad entertainment.
                  
               
            
            
               
               XXXVII.
               ARRIVE AGAIN AT SAN FRANCISCO.
               AFTER a delightful run of fourteen days, I arrived again at San Francisco, in the
                  schooner Odd Fellow, and proceeded at once to Sacramento, where I met my future
                  partner, Mr. R. H. Taylor, of the Marysville Herald, the second paper ever started
                  in California.
               He made me an offer to purchase half the establishment, and upon mature
                  deliberation and reflection of about an hour and a half I concluded to do so, and
                  immediately prepared to start for my future home in the city of Marysville, Yuba
                  county, California, and to take my seat as the junior editor of the aforementioned
                  journal.
               The Gov. Dana Steamer conveyed myself and two trunks in safety to the landing at
                  the Levee; and when I had managed, after wading up to my middle in mud and slush,
                  to find out the office of the Herald, situated then on a barren waste, known on,
                  the map as the corner of C and Second street, I resembled more the driver of a
                  swill cart, or a street-sweeping machine, than one of the corps editorial. Upon
                  knocking at the door and lifting the latch, I found my "senior," wrapped in a red
                  blanket, fast asleep, lying upon a cot, that boasted of no other ornament than
                  that it went on "tick," and repudiated altogether pillows and mattresses. The
                  attenuated form of the gallant Colonel lay stretched out in all the blissful
                  ignorance of sleep, and with mouth wide open-regardless of the hammering of the
                  foreman in an adjoining apartment, who was "putting the paper to press"-gave
                  utterance to his thoughts and pent-up feelings in a snore that would have startled
                  one less nervous than myself.
            
            

               XXXVIII.
               I TURN EDITOR.
               THE office was a little wooden shanty, of a very unpretending style of
                  architecture, and difficult indeed to describe. It had a door, a roof, and one or
                  two windows, and was, I believe, originally one of a number of "portable houses"
                  sent "round the Horn" by some enterprising man at the east, and by which
                  speculation an immense amount was realized. I think ours cost about $600-(worth at
                  home about $150.)
               After waking my "sleeping partner," and meeting with a kindly greeting, I
                  proceeded as quickly as possible to get into the "harness" of my daily business;
                  and after some three or four days' initiation by my senior, who had to go to San
                  Jose to report the proceedings of the Legislature, I was left in sole charge of
                  the "sheet."
               To say that I had no misgivings, upon viewing the receding form of my tall
                  partner, as he with trowsers tucked into his cowskin boots, and with valise in
                  hand and numberless things in his head, wended his way to the stage office to take
                  passage for Sacramento city, would be not to tell the truth. In those days
                  Californian editors generally slept with two or three double-barrelled pistols
                  under their head, and the same number of bowie knives at their feet; for if an
                  article happened to appear, reflecting in the slightest degree upon the character
                  of an individual or individuals, corporate bodies or bodies incorporate, he, she,
                  they, or it would immediately wait upon you "by a friend," demanding instant
                  satisfaction with either knives, pistols, or both. Therefore, I felt keenly the
                  fearful responsibility resting upon my shoulders.
               Our paper was then a "tri-weekly;" and as the political and consequently prosy
                  portion thereof was taken care of entirely by Mr. Taylor, it was reserved for me
                  to look after the matters of local interest, and "do up" "the short articles,
                  items," etc.
               The year of my residence in Marysville passed away so delightfully that I really regretted the thought of
                  leaving; still, as restlessness and change were the order of the day, and I
                  fancied the offer made me for my interest in the journal a good one, I made up my
                  mind to sell out; intending to return to New York, prior to a brief trip to
                  Europe, and being at this time master of a larger sum, in cash and real estate,
                  than I had ever been before or have been since.
               Many interesting incidents and adventures took place during my sojourn here; and
                  from a little memorandum book of ray brief Notes, I will jot down a few of
                  them.
            
            
               XXXIX.
               AN EDITORIAL CONCERT.
               UPON one occasion, the business of our paper led me again to San Francisco; and
                  having (as was usually the case) been very successful, not only in swelling our
                  subscription list pretty considerably, but in collecting large sums for
                  advertising, I thought I might do a little business profitably on my own account,
                  having been solicited by many of my New York friends (amusements being at that
                  time rather scarce) to give a concert.
               I accordingly went over to the "Alta" office, and got out a programme. The prices
                  were-boxes, five dollars-side boxes, three dollars-pit, three dollars.
               The bellman, to whom I had paid five dollars for, ringing in the people, and
                  calling out at the top of his voice the nature of the entertainment, had just
                  informed me that the house was full, and it was time for me to begin, when, all of
                  a sudden, I found I had forgotten the piano.
               Now as there was no orchestra, and I always accompanied myself in my own songs,
                  the reader will perceive I was in a "fix." However, great was my delight and
                  relief in the premises, when at the eleventh hour I found a gorgeous Chickering
                  grand at my disposal, which Mayor Selover, of the Union Hotel, was kind enough to
                  loan me. An apology was made by me for the delay, and all went off well; I netting
                  $600 by the labor of one hour and a half.

               The day after, the city was reduced to ashes by one of the largest and most
                  destructive fires on record; theatre, hotel, piano, and everything else being fuel
                  for the flames. The next day I received a letter from my esteemed partner, who
                  remarked that he thought it was "rather derogatory to the dignity of an editor to
                  be going about the country giving exhibitions of his vocal and imitative powers;"
                  but that he wouldn't have any material objection, provided I would
                     halve the receipts!
               So much for my "Editorial Concert!"
            
            
               XL.
               THE GREAT FIRE-AN INCIDENT AT THE BANK.
               AT this time T. Butler King, Esq., was Collector of the port, and running for U.
                  S. Senator. Our paper supported his election, and the consequence was, a very
                  "fat" advertisement fell to the lot of the proprietors of the "Marysville Herald,"
                  to the tune of $1800, which amount was duly handed to me in octagonal fifty dollar
                  gold pieces, and which was lodged for safe keeping at the banking-house of
                  Burgoyne & Co., at the corner of Montgomery and Washington streets.
               The deposit was made the day after my concert had taken place, consequently I had
                  about $2500 "on call" there at the time.
               I was standing at the top of "Clay" street, near "Pike," when the fire was raging
                  at its height; block after block of buildings were caught in the fiery embrace,
                  Union Hotel, Theatre, El Dorado Building, all, all were swept away, and at last
                  the flames caught the Bank of Burgoyne & Co., whose building was considered
                  fire-proof. It was seemingly inclosed in sheets of flame, and many a heart quailed
                  in expectation of losing every cent there deposited, for the heaviest accounts in
                  the city were kept at this pet banking-establishment. If my friend J. R. C. ever
                  reads these lines, he will recollect the query I put to him, as to
                  whether he thought the "place" would stand!
               
               On that night everybody slept in the open air, on the top of barrels, bales, or
                  anything else-there did not seem a vestige of a house left. Utter desolation and
                  despair reigned supreme. About ten o'clock on the following morning, Mr. Geo.
                  Plume, one of the firm, upon going to the safe (one of the celebrated Herring's by
                  the way) handed me my buckskin bag of gold, with even the sealing-wax not
                  melted!
               So much for a good safe, and my luck!
               Before I left Marysville, it was suggested that I should have a "farewell
                  concert." The following "correspondence" upon the subject appeared in the daily
                  papers:-
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Marysville, Nov. 29, 1851.
                               
                                 To Stephen C. Massett, Esq. 
                              
                           
                           DEAR SIR:-Before you break the final link, and bid us farewell, we
                              earnestly solicit you to give to the ladies and citizens of Marysville
                              a public concert,-in order that they, as well as ourselves, may once
                              again have the gratification and pleasure of enjoying and appreciating
                              your excellent voice and musical talents.-You will thus add another to
                              the "pleasant memories" we shall ever have of you, and, we hope, also,
                              increase those which you kindly say you will take away with you.
                           We pledge ourselves to give you a bumper, and with the sincere desire
                              that happiness and prosperity may ever attend you,
                           We are, dear sir, With every consideration, Yours most faithfully,

                           GENTLEMEN:-Your very kind and flattering letter has just been received

               On the 2d of March, 1852, I left San Francisco in the Pacific M. S. S.
                  "Northerner," Captain Randall, for Panama; and a most delightful trip we had of
                  it.
               After enjoying myself to my heart's content once again in dear New York, and
                  receiving the congratulations of friends upon my safe arrival from the Land of
                  Gold, I made up my mind to pay a visit to my relations in England, and make a
                  brief trip on the Continent.
               I accordingly presented myself at the office of C. H. Marshall, and engaged a
                  passage in the packet ship "Great Western," Captain W. G. Furber, for
                  Liverpool.
               We left New York on the morning of February 17, 1853, and landed at the Victoria
                  Dock, Liverpool, on the 7th of March, after a delightful run of only 16 days.
            
            
               XLI.
               SINGULAR SENSATIONS UPON RE-VISITING ENGLAND.
               IF I have succeeded in interesting the reader sufficiently in these reminiscences
                  and sketches, to have kept in his memory the date of my arrival in New York from
                  England, he will find that about seventeen years of my life had passed away since
                  I had left my "native heath;" and certainly my sensations upon my return, as may
                  be imagined, were of a very peculiar nature.
               I had left England a boy, arriving in the New World with no fixed purpose or
                  intention, had led somewhat of a discursive life, and certainly a very different
                  one from that carved out for me by my beloved parents.
               
               How many and shifting were the scenes I had passed through. How many changes had
                  taken place; what views of, the past greeted my mental vision, as I gazed through
                  the long vista of the departed years, and my heart lingered with pleasure and with
                  pain on the "pictures of memory," that flashed for a moment before me, as I trod
                  once again the shores of my native land! Pleasure at the thought of meeting once
                  more with the few that remained of our once extended family circle. Pain as I
                  yearned for 
                     
                        "The touch of a vanished hand,
                        And the sound of a voice that was still!"
                     
                  
               
            
            
               XLII.
               MY FIRST DAY IN LIVERPOOL.
               IT was exactly half-past four o'clock on the afternoon of Tuesday the 7th of
                  March, that I landed with my baggage at the Victoria Dock, and proceeded to the
                  dept to be examined.
               This I found (contrary to my expectations) to be a very easy matter, the officer
                  simply passing his hand down each side of my trunk, and taking my word that there
                  was nothing in my hat-box but my new "Genin."
               I then took a "car," as they called it, and drove to the "Adelphi" Hotel-one of
                  the best taverns in England-to the porter who carried my luggage from the steamer
                  to the baggage office, I gave two shillings (or 50 cents), to the "cabman," one
                  shilling and sixpence.
               I found a "book" ( la Americaine) in the hall of the hotel, in which I registered
                  my name, and was shown to a very comfortable room (No. 18) by a very pretty little
                  chambermaid.
               The bedstead and fixtures generally amused me exceedingly-so different from ours
                  in America! It was ascended on either side by a step-ladder-it was surrounded by
                  huge damask curtains-a fire made ready for lighting- guard, fender, poker, shovel,
                  and tongs; these trifles brought up most strangely to me the "days lang syne!"
               Now, I do not intend in these brief "glances" at places and people, to give any
                  very extended sketch or account of the surroundings, or of my sojournings,-the
                  thing has been done to death from the year one, up to the present
                  time; and I shall content myself by saying in reference to Liverpool,
                  that I think it one of the most gloomy looking places I have ever visited, and
                  that I felt that I could "do" it in one day quite easily, and to my
                     own satisfaction.
               Towards night I strolled a little through the town. The first thing that struck me
                  was the "street-singing," two blind men were walking hand in hand, in the gutter,
                  looking as blind men invariably do, right up in the sky-singing "Rejoice greatly
                  in the Lord," whilst in another street an awful specimen of humanity-stone-blind
                  also, shuffled along, with a tract in his hand, which he kept constantly thrusting
                  nervously at the passers-by, singing out in the most doleful manner, "Moore's
                  Almanack," only a "apenny!"
               
                   
               
               At the Theatre Royal (a miserably dirty looking place-that after the luxuriousness
                  of "Wallack's," "Laura Keene's "Niblo's," or the "Academy," was really
                  intolerable) I found they were playing the "Enchantress."
               
               The audience was slim, and I did not see a pretty woman in the house.
               I paid four shillings-(one dollar) for my seat in the "dress circle"-the upper
                  boxes were three shillings; the pit two shillings, and the gallery one
                  shilling.
               The singers were Miss Louisa Pyne, Mr. Harrison, and Mr. Borrani.
               The lady I thought bore a strong resemblance to "The Queen"-and has one of the
                  first voices I ever heard, she sang superbly. Harrison, with decidedly a fine
                  voice, was harsh in his style, and occasionally sang out of tune-he is a large
                  muscular good-looking fellow, a little like "Wood," and a handsome likeness of
                  "Gardner," who played at the Park some years since. Borrani's voice grated on the
                  ear-he seemed to have no method-he is a very Jewish-looking personage.
               The orchestra was led (as the bills say) by Mr. Fitz-william, son of the
                  actress-and was wretched-and to my astonishment the "first fiddle" was played by a
                  "colored gemman"-yes, a regular woolly-headed mulatto.
               I stood two acts, and turned my steps to the "Amphitheatre" where they were
                  playing "Uncle Tom's Cabin"-stood about five minutes of that-for the dirt, dust,
                  heat, and fleas, were not to be endured. I accordingly adjourned to a thorough
                  English looking Oyster Saloon-being a room about four feet wide by six deep. Here
                  a very civil, fat, rosy-faced man, with "bib and tucker" on, opened me a "couple
                  of dozen of Natives," his wife cutting me some thin "bread and butter;" and
                  washing it down with a glass of very indifferent ale, I paid my bill, and toddled
                  to the "Adelphi," followed and beset by beggars, old women with bills of the play,
                  distressed seamen, and abandoned females.
               Arrived at the Hotel, I had a very pleasant interview with the composer Mr. George
                  Barker, known in America as the author of "Mary Blane," the "White Squall." After
                  a "strong cup," I adjourned to my cozy chamber and high old bed, the
                  top of which having reached I seemed to fall through an ocean of feather beds,
                  covered by at least a bale of blankets, and several hundred yards of the choicest
                  Irish-linen-it having first been subjected by my pretty chambermaid to the
                  operation of the warming pan, the reader can well imagine I did not suffer much
                  that night from "cold."
               Thus ended my first, and ("I guess") last night in Liverpool.
            
            
               XLIII.
               ALL ABOUT THE CITY OF LONDON.
               THE next day I took the Express Train for London, paying one pound seventeen
                  shillings for a first class ticket-this is about twice the amount that would be
                  charged for the same distance in America. I arrived at the Euston Square Station
                  at about four o'clock, and proceeded at once to the residence of my nephew Dr. F.
                  C. W-- in Great Coram St., Russell Square.
               
               Once again did I find myself in my native city.
               How difficult I find it to describe my feelings as I obeyed the request to "Knock
                  and King" that stared me in the face, at the house of my relative! When I left
                  England he was a boy at school. I return to find him a practising physician, with
                  a little family of youngsters! And then the greeting! the mental surprise of each
                  at the change! the eagerness with which I sought to catch the faintest remembrance
                  of the past, either by glancing at the portrait, or a piece of furniture, or by
                  questions innumerable-with these sensations few of my readers will sympathize-and
                  I will proceed at once to "jog along" in my own way with my doings in the big
                  city.
               If the reader imagines that I am going to describe London
                  particularly or any other city, town, or hamlet, I may have to mention, he or she
                  is greatly mistaken; and as I said at the commencement of these "reminiscences," I
                  intended to be guided by no rule, in the construction of this book, but just to
                  "jot down" scenes, incidents, and things-as they occurred in my brief sojournings
                  in the different portions of the globe, I have at various intervals visited.
               
               It seems to me that the sensations of a person on his first arrival in London will
                  be those of intense curiosity. They may not partake particularly of the feeling of
                  wonder or admiration; because the visitor may probably, at a distance, have been
                  accustomed to attach a vague idea of importance and grandeur to everything
                  belonging to this City-and the places and objects that may first meet his gaze-as
                  in my case-may not possess so much externally to recommend them to his notice, as
                  many towns which he may have passed through on his journey.
               For instance, a person coming by any of the Eastern suburbs, will be sure to form
                  a very different idea of the vastness or opulence of the great Metropolis, from
                  that conceived by another who comes to it by a western road, and takes up his
                  residence at a West-end-Hotel-but most assuredly, wherever he alights, he must
                  immediately receive an impression of the greatness of London, and it seems to me
                  that his curiosity to explore it will be immediately excited.
               My advice, in the first place, to all visiting the "Great Metropolis," is to take
                  apartments in some nice quarter of the town-in the vicinity of Piccadilly, or
                  thereabouts, say in Old Bond Street, St. James's Place, or Duke Street, and get
                  your meals when and where you please. Hotel life in London is not only extremely
                  expensive, but to an American I should imagine anything but desirable. Indeed I
                  have often heard Englishmen remark, that the American system of charging a certain
                  fixed sum per diem is a great deal the best.
               "Simpson's" in the Strand, nearly opposite "Exeter Hall," is a first-rate place to
                  dine-at about two shillings and six pence cost, including your pint of porter. If
                  you happen to be a little further west-the "Albany" in Piccadilly, or the
                  "Waterloo" in St. James, will answer equally well; at either of these places, you
                  can get a capital dinner for three shillings, or seventy-five cents.
               Added to this there are innumerable "chop-houses," such as the "Cock,"
                  "Bolt-on-tow," "Dr. Johnsons," the "Goose and Gridiron," "Dolly's."
               Now as I have stated above, the plan is much the best to hire a sleeping apartment
                  in a good location, for which you will pay one pound one shilling or five dollars
                  a week, or even less, if you do not care to be in so fashionable a locality, as
                  for instance in "Cecil," "Surrey," or "Catharine" street in the strand, a very
                  snug and cozy lodging can be had for twelve shillings per week.
               Thus it will be seen, that a person desirous of economizing can reside in the big
                  city for one pound ten shillings or seven dollars per week.
            
            
               XLIV.
               THE "FIELDING"-MR. THACKERAY, ETC.
               IT was during my connexion with the "Marysville Herald," that I made the
                  acquaintance of two young Englishmen, travelling in California, whom I
                  subsequently met in London, and to whom I am indebted for many pleasant
                  introductions.
               I was introduced by one of these gentlemen to the "Fielding," a
                  literary club (now I believe defunct) situated in Henrietta street, Covent
                  Garden.
               Of the notables I met on my first visit, "Thackeray," "Douglas Jerrold," and
                  "Albert Smith," were the most conspicuous.
               Thackeray had just returned from America, where he had been very successful with
                  his Lectures on the "Georges."
               I had been presented to the author of "Pendennis," by a member of the club-a Sir
                  George A-, which, doubtless had the effect of inducing the learned satirist to
                  cast one of his patronizing glances on so unimportant an individual as myself.
               Now at this club, and at the "Garrick," (about which more by and bye) there seemed
                  to obtain among the members a perfect "free-masonry" of feeling; and badinage was
                  indulged in to any extent.
               Thackeray had just entered, and was thus addressed by the "business man" of Albert
                  Smith, "Well, Thackeray, you got on
                  very well with your 'show' in America; nave you seen ours?"
               Thackeray seemed at first to take no notice of the remark, but walked slowly to
                  the fireplace, sat down in an arm chair, crossed his legs, adjusted his
                  spectacles, and with the tips of the fingers of each hand meeting, and looking
                  straight at a piece of Liverpool coal, replied in the following curt manner:
               "I never had much opinion of your brother's talent; but I admire his good
                  fortune!"
               The fact is, he did not "see" the applicability of the word "show," or like the
                  free and easy style of interrogatory indulged in.
            
            
               XLV.
               COMICAL SCENES IN A POLICE COURT.
               THE police regulations of the metropolis are admirably adapted for the maintenance
                  of peace and order, and are very much superior to the old fogy system of
                  "watchmen" and constables. The chief office of the Force, I think, is in
                  "Guildhall," in the city, and I was informed the total number of men, including
                  sergeants and inspectors, etc., was over 7000.
               One of the most celebrated of the police offices is in Bow-street, Covent Garden.
                  Here upon one or two occasions (as the reader shall know) I enjoyed a hearty
                  laugh.
               The "Court" is open to the public each day, while the magistrate is sitting, and
                  presents to the reflective observer, many scenes of varied character, which make a
                  lasting impression on the mind. The First Case was
               MR. DODDLES AND HIS DONKEY.-James Doddles and his wife were charged with
                  disorderly and riotous conduct under the following unpleasant circumstances;-Mr.
                  Doddles presented a most chilling appearance, for his clothes were wet through,
                  and his hair, matted with mud and blood, clearly showed he had not had an
                  opportunity for the use of a comb for some months past. His better half-in more
                  senses than one, for she was twice his size-stood before the Bench, with her nasal
                  organ entirely enveloped in plaster and rag. The couple altogether presented an
                  appearance which could not fail to create a smile even from the Bench. The
                  evidence of the police was to the effect of their having seen both defendants at
                  daylight this (Saturday) morning very much the worse for plentiful imbibings, and
                  in company with a -- donkey, who apparently shared in Mr. Doddles's frolics, if he
                  had not in his drink, for he was incessantly kicking up his heels at every drunken
                  attempt they made to load him with their wegetables; and once on finding that a
                  fine bunch of carrots, which they had slung across his neck, was within reach of
                  his grinders, he speedily displaced and nearly devoured it, to the great amusement
                  of the lookers-on, before he was detected. Ultimately it was found requisite to
                  remove James and his wife to the station-house, for they created a great
                  disturbance, besides wallopping the donkey unmercifully.-Magistrate: What are you,
                  Mr. Doddles?-James: Your honorable vorship, I sells wegetables and all kinds of
                  green stuff.-Magistrate: And where do you live?-James: Vy, I lives close alongside
                  of Borl's-pond.-Magistrate: What pond do you mean?-Officer: Ball's-pond, Dalston,
                  sir.-James: To be sure; but I alvays goes to Common-gardern-market for my goods,
                  vet or dry, vind or no vind, and precious vindy it vos this morning, I can tell
                  you, and no mistake.-Magistrate: Come, now, tell me how you and Mrs. Doddles got
                  into this state, and be quick, if you please?-Mrs. Doddles: Go it, Jim, tell his
                  lordship all about it.-James: So I vill. Yer see, yer honor, this is my wife-my
                  Sarah-(putting his hand on her head to force her to curtsey.)-Mrs. Doddles: Now
                  then, Jem, mind my nose.(Much laughter.)-James: Veil, sir, as I vos saying, Sarah
                  and I goes to Common-garden on the donkey.-Magistrate: What, both! it must be a
                  famous strong one, then.-James (seriously, and holding up his finger): Yer honor,
                  it's the werry best "moke" as ever had long ears. (Great mirth.) Well-we goes
                  there safe enough-and in course I'll tell the truth. We had a drain or two afore
                  we bought the stuff, and a drain or two
                  arter. Now, I don't know how it is, but my Sarah and me often drank twenty times
                  as much, but it never got so far ahead on us before. Then the "moke" couldn't
                  stand on his legs, and vonce he threw us both clean off him.-Magistrate: What,
                  threw you both off?-James: That's it, yer Honor; "up goes the donkey, and away
                  goes Sarah and me." (Renewed laughter.) I cuts my head open again a scraper, and
                  my Sarah breaks her nose. Well, then, I owns as I did it-yes-I vollopped the
                  "moke," and-and-that's all of it.-Magistrate: Is your wife's nose much
                  injured?-Sarah: Your lordship, the doctor sea as how the cartlid (cartilage) of it
                  is werry nigh broked. The donkey threw us away flying, and I fell with my nose
                  between the rails of a grating.-Subsequently, and amid continual merriment, the
                  defendants were dismissed-his Worship thinking no doubt that they had suffered
                  enough.
               The Second was
               THE TAIL (TALE) OF A JACKASS.-From the era that Saul went forth to seek his
                  father's asses, and from the intelligent donkey which reproved
                  Balaam, down to the veritable Lumber Troop, asses have formed a
                  continuous link in the chain of human society. Mahomet rode on one to Mecca. Peter
                  Pindar wrote an epistle of some two hundred lines or more "to his ass, Peter."
                  Sterne moraliseth over the truly sentimental dead "Neddy," at "Nampont." Mr.
                  William Wordsworth says mighty fine things of a temperance looking
                  donkey, drowned in his own beloved lake (see the Excursion, Book iv., Pedlar,
                  etc.) and brays as eloquently as poor Sancho Panza, when his "dumb animal!" went
                  astray in the mountains-not to mention the "Golden Ass of Apuleius." The ass of
                  Hampstead-heath, however, distances all other animals.
               John Jobson vs. Timothy Brown.-This was an action for the recovery of
                  a donkey, price 12s., sold by John Jobson-commonly known as "Jack Sleeky," to the
                  defendant, Tim Brown, for the aforesaid sum of money.
               First Commissioner-How will you pay, Mr. Brown?
               Mr. Brown-Not no how, if so be nose it-(laughter)-his donkey's a reg'lar wishous
                  one, and I couldn't manage him not no how-(laughter.)

               Third Commissioner-Well, sir, you shouldn't a' bought him.
               Sleeky Jack-Now, then, jest year me speak, an' ill up and tell you. This year
                  hidentical donkey as he speaks on, used to run on Hampstead heath on a Sundays,
                  along with another one; this year tother one died through severe weather, and the
                  donkey as I bought took it so much to heart as I never seed afore-first he took to
                  biting, then he took to kicking, and at last one o' our chaps on the heath said as
                  how a change of hair 'ud do him good, so I took the hanimal down to Blackheath and
                  sold him to Tim Brown, as kept donkeys for women to ride on.(Roars of
                  laughter.)
               First Commissioner-Well, and what passed?
               Sleeky Jack-Why, Tim Brown axed me how he'd go-trot him out, says I-and werry well
                  he trotted-then he ses, ses he, what's he carry? anythink, ses I, as he stands
                  under-(laughter)-werry good, ses he, but I ain't got the Ochre-(money)-oh, as for,
                  that 'ere, ses I, 'taint no matter-so we 'greed for 12 hog (shillings), and said
                  as how he'd git it out of him (the donkey) afore next week, and fork out the
                  browns like a man of honor-(roars of laughter)-werry well, I left the donkey-he
                  never did-and I never set eyes on him, not till sich times as I met him in the
                  skittle ground at the back o' Hog-lane.
               Second Commissioner-Now, Mr. Brown, what do you say to this?
               Tim Brown-Some on it's true, my lord, and some on it's not true. Fact is, somehow
                  or other, he managed that ere mawnin as he speaks on, to get the donkey inter a
                  werry good temper-in fact, I yeard 'em a conwersing together, whilst I turned
                  round to Bill Smith about a harness, and I suspect werry much he'd bin a givin on
                  him some wittles.-(laughter.) No sooner was he (Sleeky Jack) gone, than the
                  hanimal set up such a huniwersal holler, as set all the t'other asses a gom, and
                  we couldn't quiet 'em not no how-(it wos a downright reglar munity (mutiny), and
                  nothink couldn't stop it-nobody couldn't ride him-I wallopped him-no go;-tried him
                  at a hayband-no go; twisted his tail-just the same, my lord; so arter I was tired
                  on him, and couldn't knock no sense in him, I let him go, and I never set eyes on him since; and it's my opinion he
                  come to a bad end, as all obstropolus asses does-there. (Roars of laughter, in
                  which the commissioners joined heartily.)
               After a short consultation, it was decided that half the sum should be awarded
                  with costs. So much for an ass we can fancy old Dogberry, chanting to the favorite
                  tune of one of the renowned Lumber Troopers the "Lass of Richmond Hill."
               The third all about a hot savvilor (or sausage) and a baked tater:
               LAMBETH-STREET.-A charge of assault was preferred before T. Walker, Esq., by a
                  sleak greasy-faced eatinghouse keeper, against a thick-set hungry-looking
                  mechanic.
               "Please your vorship," began the complainant, "I sells cook'd
                     wittles; and this here chap corned a Saturday in my shop, and said
                  he was 'werry peckish, and should like summat nice. 'Vot
                  can you have nicer,' sis I, 'nor a hot savvilor and bak'd tater?'-'Veil,' sis he,
                  Til have a hot savillor with some mutton gravy.' So as I was a dipping into the
                  pot for von, I seed him prig a piece of roast wheel. 'Cup,' sis I, that's no go?
                  and I ax'd him to drop a bob for the weal, when he said he'd hadn't got a mag more
                  than twopence to pay for the savillor. Then I jumps over the counter, and ketches
                  the weal out of his fist, and claps it back agin into the dish. Arterwards I
                     werry gently shoved him out of the shop; and while my back was
                  turned, he fetches me sich a nasty kick behind, that I vent smack agin a saucepan
                  of hot weggetables."
               The defendant, when called upon to explain the aforesaid kick, declared that the
                  complainant had not only commenced the assault, but had used "wiolent
                  langvidge."
               "That ere's false," said the complainant, "for I'm always werry pertikeler
                     never to give nobody no sarce."
               The magistrate considering the assault proved, fined the defendant 1s. and
                  discharged him.
            
            

               XLVI.
               THE LONDON SHOWMAN.
               THE next thing in order of my reminiscences of London will be a sketch of a
                  personal encounter with a veritable "showman," and the proprietor of a "Punch and
                  Judy."
               I was walking on Tower Hill one morning, when I saw a man, dressed in a
                  tight-fitting spangled dress, endeavoring to make a circle among a crowd of ragged
                  men and boys by throwing a large ball attached to a long rope in their midst; upon
                  going a little closer, I found that a variety of performances were about to take
                  place.
               On the steps of a big one-story yellow house, with two windows with red curtains
                  and a door with a brass knocker, resting on four large wheels, some three or four
                  feet from the ground, stood a man, of the most singular appearance, "hollering"
                  out at the top of his voice, at the same time slapping the side of the show with a
                  short rattan which he held in his hand.
               He was a sort of "Bill Sykes" looking fellow, and had evidently been little
                  addicted to paying much attention to his toilette.
               Upon closer inspection, I noticed he relieved the monotony of singing out the
                  nature of the exhibition, and the thrashing thereof with his cane, by blowing on a
                  certain instrument, known in that locality as a "mouth organ," made of reeds of
                  different sizes, joined together, and fixed in a leathern case, stuck in the top
                  of his waistcoat, immediately under the chin; at the same time, with both hands
                  beating a tremendous drum, and moving his head, with puffed-out cheeks and
                  screwed-up mouth, up and down the reeds, his eyes fairly starting from their
                  sockets with the exertion of blowing, and having the appearance of a man in the
                  last stage of strangulation.
               On his head he wore a very dismal looking white hat, with the crown knocked in,
                  and a dirty pipe sticking in the hatband thereof; a fustian jacket, very oily and
                  greasy, covered the upper part of his body, while a portion of his fat legs were encased in a pair of highly-polished
                  corduroy knee breeches, the remaining part being covered with a pair of thick
                  worsted hose, with laced ankle jacks, and iron specks to match.
               At the top of his voice, which it seemed to me you could hear for miles, he held
                  forth in something of the following style:
               "Now then-vork up, vork up 'ere, and see the vonderful 'Amabarcadoria' or Great
                  Physician from Bengal, in the Vest Inges; he persesses the most unparalleled and
                  inestimated medicines; and can cure any incident to humanity, from a corn to a
                  consumption. We has a long list of cures he has performed (hif you'll step inside)
                  by his grand, eliptical, Asiatical, piratical, puritanical, nervio cronio machine!
                  but will only read you three out of 30,000. Here is the first:
               "'Dear Sir-I was jammed to death in a linseed-oil mill at Faversham. Cured with
                  two bottles!"
               "And here is one which is the vonderfullest of all.
               "Venturing too near the powder mill at Hammersmith, I was, by a sudden explosion,
                  blown into a million of atoms. By this unpleasant and unforeseen haccident, I was
                  rendered quite unfit for business, which were a butcher's; and hearing of your
                  grand bilious cordial, I was required to make a trial thereat-when, to the
                  astonishment of my family, the first bottle united my stray particles, and the
                  second eradicated an entire cure.'
               "Vork up, vork up-this is the Regular Booth, and inside is the Principal Emperor
                  of the Carcasses Mountains.
               "He can take a red-hot poker, and run it into a barrel of gunpowder, and it will
                  not go off.
               "He will then load a blunderbuss with some of the dentical powder as would not
                  explode, charged with twelve ledden bullets, and will fire it full in the face of
                  any of the spectators as pleases, without there being hingered.
               "He will borrow half-a-crown of any of the company, vitch he vill never return to
                  them, vithout any motive whatever. He will then introduce you to the three
                  celebrated brothers-
               "Halley, Muley, and Hassan, from the Calaboose Islands, from which he was
                  originally a native. Halley will take a lighted torch in his hand, and jump down
                  the throat of his brother Mulley, who will in his turn take another torch, and
                  jump down the throat of his brother Hassan; and though Hassan the elder is
                  encumbered with the weight of his twa brothers, Halley and Muley, yet
                  he will take another torch, make a flip-flap, and jump down his own throat,
                  leaving us all in the dark!"
               I could not stand it any longer; so I went in. I forgot to mention, that on one
                  side of the house, upon a piece of canvas, was displayed a painting of a "Fat
                  Boy."
               Immediately upon entering, the showman, pointing with his short stick to a perfect
                  mountain of fat, proceeded as follows:-
               "Master Villiam Fiddes-or the Hinfant Goliar! He is the seventh son of Joel
                  (that's me) and Helizabeth Fiddes, who is industrious and respectable persons, as
                  resides in Manchester, which was in the month of November he was born. He is only
                  six years of age, and is considered one of the greatest vonders wich this world as
                  ever produced by the Supreme Being. Ladies and gentlemen, when this Fenominer of
                  nature were born, he had four regular teeth, and very shortly after that possessed
                  twenty-two teeth.
               "He is a remarkable helthy child when he is well, and is very amusing, and
                  possessed of very pretty features.-(Show the gents your leg, Billy.)
               "His food consists of a common and wholesome description, and is generally boiled
                  in hot water, as the doctor says his hinside requires soft things, and is
                  considered the greatest wonder of the world. It would be morally unpossible to
                  describe everything belonging to this great wonder of nature, as he is endowed
                  with every necessary qualification vich adorns the human frame, as such should be
                  produced, and is mild, sensible, and pleasant.
               "This wonder of thousands has been universally admired by all classes in the
                  kingdom for his gigantic proportions-
                  (show your bust, Billy!)-which hexceed to a pre-himinent degree any other of the
                  human species in the universe."
               Stepping down, he desired me to look through the hole of a peep show box, resting
                  on tressels, magnifying several highly-wrought colored engravings.
               "Now then (said he), vipe your noses, and don't breathe upon the glasses. First
                  scene in the grand mis-representation of the battle of Waterloo. Look to the
                  right, and there you may perceive His Grace the Duke of Vellingtine mounted on a

                  which nature has produced.

               PUNCH AND JUDY.
               I HAD been for several days listening in vain for the well-remembered cry (a sort
                  of cross between the shrill squeak of a pig and a penny trumpet) that invariably
                  precedes the approach of a Punch and Judy, when one morning, in the vicinity of
                  Manchester Square, I suddenly pounced upon one.
               I was delighted. I had not seen one since I was a boy. But then there was no
                  audience. In vain did the showman, having slipped from his shoulders his portable
                  play-house, and looking up and down the square, and up at the windows of the
                  houses, announce to the inhabitants his arrival. Nobody appeared. At last I
                  stepped up to him, and asked him how much he'd "show" for?
               This seemed to surprise him; when, eyeing me from head to foot, he replied-
               "Veil, seeing as 'ow you're all by yourself, I'll give you the whole thing for
                  eighteen pence, cos I may pick up a few 'a' pence besides."
               To this I assented; and accordingly he jumped inside of the show box, and let down
                  the curtains.
               For the benefit of those of my readers who have not seen one of those
                  "institutions," I will endeavor to give a brief description.
               It appears, as I was informed, that they first made their appearance in the
                  streets of London in the reign of Charles the Second; and have a charter from that
                  monarch, giving them the privilege of exhibiting in any portion of the city
                  without molestation.
               The consequence is, that their audiences present a pretty miscellaneous
                  appearance, and are generally attentive and quiet, consisting of fogies (old and
                  young), chambermaids, nursery maids, servants (in and out of livery), boys and
                  girls (of every age and size), and now and then a stray policeman.
               The show is about eight feet high and three feet wide, made light, and very
                  portable. A box, containing the movable figures, consisting of Punch, his Judy,
                  the Doctor, Nurse, Undertaker, Thief, Grave-digger, etc., as also the Gallows,
                  Coffin, Houses, Watchman, and other characters and "fixings," is usually carried
                  by another man, who assists in the performance outside by asking and
                  answering the questions of Mr. Punch et al. inside.
               
               The top part of the show represents a stage, the figures of which are worked by a
                  man inside with wires, upon which appear in quick succession Mr. Punch, with a big
                  stick in his arm, Mrs. Judy, with a dirty cap on, who is instantly greeted by her
                  lord and master with several whacks, with the big stick aforesaid, on the back of
                  her wooden head, one blow of which on an ordinary skull would be "death to nature." She, however, rises
                  immediately, as if refreshed by this gentle memento of her lord's affection, and
                  seizing the stick from his hand, commences wolloping him in the same style. In
                  vain Punch hollers out peccavi. She's got the upper hand now, and continues to
                  pommel him most unmercifully. The audience are in ecstasies. The usual striking
                  scenes of a five-act melodrama take place. A house is erected, containing one door
                  and a window; the latch is thrown open, a head pops out from the second story, and
                  disappears immediately beneath the heavy blow of a stick from a wooden man in the
                  street, who is seized by a wooden watchman, with a dark lantern made of paper. In
                  the course of the play, somebody is killed, and the murderer happening to be Mr.
                  Punch, he is sentenced to be hung. A gallows is erected, and the murderer
                  executed, and afterwards placed in a coffin. At this critical juncture, when the
                  audience suppose him to be really defunct-he jumps up, gets hold of his stick, and
                  knocks down parson, undertaker, and his weeping relatives, friends, gallows, and
                  all-makes a bow to the audience-gives a farewell w-eeeeekk I and the play is over;
                  and he jumps into his box, to delight another portion of the inhabitants of the
                  big city.
               The following is not a portrait of Punch, but the latest carte de visite of a civil old fellow immortalized on page 181.

               SOMETHING ABOUT LONDON BOYS.
               THE "showman" is generally followed by a crowd of boys-and it seems to me that
                  London boys are as peculiar to their locality as the Palm is to the East.
               They delight, especially in "Fisticuffs" and "Punch and Judys,"-very fond of
                  rabbits and birds, white mice, and pigeons; always out of the elbows, addicted to
                  screeching, whistling and singing, great proficients on the Jew's Harp, faultless
                  at peg in the ring; able to knuckle down before all other boys in the universe;
                  fond to destruction of apple-peel and pocket-knives, tyrants over their juniors,
                  but plucky to their seniors; born with a very great contempt for young swells, and
                  all descriptions of old ladies; witty beyond their years, and as vagrant as the
                  London sparrows for which they set traps upon the smoky house? tops; they may be
                  found in swarms wherever there is a sight, or an accident, or a water-cock turned
                  on. They delight in everything dangerous. You may see them running their hardest
                  along a parapet, or climbing over the spiked railings of the park. Keen sportsmen,
                  they wander with an old tin shaving-pot, a short stick, thread and hook, to enjoy
                  a day's fishing for stickle-backs in the Hampstead ponds. They are the mortal
                  enemies of butterflies and cockroaches. Democrats to the heart's core, they keep
                  up an incessant warfare against boys of gentle birth. They glory in their
                  corduroy. The vagrant habit that in afterlife will prove their curse, and
                  accomplish their fall, grows fast upon them. The want of their parents makes them
                  old as soon as they can walk. Sent to fetch the beer, when other and more
                  fortunate children are laughing upon gaily painted rocking horses-taught to look
                  sharply upon the world, to see that they get good weight and full pints; cuffed
                  for every fault, and rewarded for any service by the permission to play about the
                  streets-they are as wild as the offspring of the woods.
            
            
               
               XLIX.
               KENILWORTH CASTLE.
               I HAD been greatly fascinated when a boy by the delightful description in the
                  "Sketch Book" of Washington Irving, of his visit to "Stratford-upon-Avon," and had
                  long cherished the idea of paying my individual respects to the landlady of the
                  "Golden Lion Inn." Accordingly on a bright June morning, I took the train from
                  London to Coventry, en route to Kenilworth, Warwick, and Stratford.
               Stopped at Coventry just long enough to see the old-fashioned looking house of
                  "Peeping Tom," and take a glass of "home-brewed," and I thought I'd take a quiet
                  stroll towards the primitive town of Kenilworth.
               The walk from this point to Warwick was indeed lovely-the distance, I think, about
                  five miles-the whole country looked like a magnificent flower-garden-the quiet
                  depths of the meadows, and the mossy roots of ancient trees, with their bright
                  leaves waving on high their "plumes of green;" the sheep-bells tinkled in the
                  distance, the cowslips, buttercup, and primroses, peeped up to greet me as I
                  passed; the sweetest little marygolds gemmed the ground in every direction-lovely
                  daisies with a pupil of gold, and an iris of snow-white petals, like a pale glory
                  surrounding it, followed in its wake by the sweet violet, accompanied by a trumpet
                  shaped flower, of delicate construction, and of a pale blue color, that held up
                  its slender head with, a decidedly elegant and thorough-bred air,-dotted about
                  here and there was a little red flower that crimsoned with a blush much richer
                  than the reddest coral, as I crushed its dew-charged leaves beneath my careless
                  tread-then there were some little meek white flowers nestling modestly away in the
                  sheltering grass, betraying their graceful presence by a languid perfume, faint,
                  but very sweet;-then came the cottages, with the pretty little gardens in
                  front,-and the roses creeping round the porches,-the bleating of the little
                  lambs-and from this lovely spot, over which leaned the uplifted blue of a
                  cloudless sky, a world of bright-winged things sent up their hymn of praise!
               And now a "word or" so about Kenilworth and its renowned "Castle."
               Most interesting was my ramble through the venerable remains of the once
                  magnificent dwelling of Royalty, and it seemed to me there could not be one more
                  deserving of notice, or more worthy the admiration of the lover of picturesque
                  beauty than this same Kenilworth Castle.
               I entered at a little gate, inside of which was a sort of "porter's lodge," and
                  there I found a very civil sort of spoken old fellow, who at every word kept
                  touching his hat, replying to my numerous questions in the most obsequious
                  manner.
               The principal places pointed put to me were-The Inner Court-and "Grand Court,"
                  Csar Tower-The Three Kitchens-The Strong Tower-King Henry's Lodgings-Sir Robert
                  Dudley's Lobby-The Presence Chamber-The Great Hall, or Banqueting Room-Mortimer's
                  Tower-Secret Postern-The Swan Tower-"Amy Robsart's Bower"-The Plaisance, etc.
               Here then, I thought, had walked, driven, rode, sat, eaten, slept, drank, laughed,
                  scolded, frowned, and smiled the haughty Queen Elizabeth-my thoughts flew thick
                  and fast.
               I was imagining what sort of a looking cove the Earl of Leicester was, when a
                  vision of Sir Walter Raleigh, spreading that velvet coat out for the Queen to walk
                  on, would come to me. I had hardly thought of this, when phantoms of Sir Walter
                  Scott, Rebecca, Amy Robsart-and even the "Bowery Theatre!" Blount, Tressilian,
                  etc., floated in my brain-and I seemed thus as if by some spell, to be brought in
                  close review with the halls, the ceremonies, the tournaments, the banquets, the
                  domestic usages, of people who had lived hundreds of years ago!
               The scenery around and about Kenilworth is, as I have before said, beautiful. On
                  the night of my arrival all was quiet repose and rural beauty, beaming with
                  cheerfulness and felicity, and though the Castle of Kenilworth is now only a pile
                  of venerable ruins, still it is magnificent in its decay, and still the glory and the pride of the
                  place in which it stands.
            
            
               L.
               WARWICK CASTLE.
               ON reaching the little town of "Warwick," I "made" for the "Castle." Upon arriving
                  in the town I was told I should find it very difficult to gain admittance, as it
                  was after the hour that visitors were allowed to enter. I thought, however, I'd
                  try-accordingly I rattled away at an immense lion-headed knocker-three times as
                  large as any "Lord's" in Grosvenor square-and the big gate quietly opened-a very
                  pleasant old lady presenting herself at the entrance.
               She said it was impossible for me to see the Castle that day-as the "Earl of
                  Warwick" was not at all well. I then asked her if she would take my
                  "card" to his "Lordship," upon the back of which I wrote as follows:
               "An American would feel greatly obliged by the Earl of Warwick's permission to
                  take a hasty (plate of soup I would have liked, for I was mighty
                  hungry)-glance at the Castle, as he will soon leave for America, and not probably
                  visit Warwick again."
               This had the desired effect-for having waited in the "Lodge" some time, my female
                  friend returned with his Lordship's permission.
               Away I went through bright yellow gravel walks, rows of stately trees, bowers of
                  loveliness, fragrance, and beauty, until reaching another gateway, and descending
                  a flight of steps, a large door was opened, by a very good-looking, portly, grey
                  headed man-the steward-who told me his name was "Gregory," and that he had been in
                  the Earl's service fourteen years.
               This magnificent castle is one of the noblest specimens of ancient grandeur, I am
                  told, that England now possesses, and is of extreme antiquity.
               The approach to the outer court of the Castle, is through a winding road cut out
                  of the solid rock, extending upwards of one hundred yards, the sides of which are
                  most luxuriantly draperied with evergreens, ivy, etc.
               This emerges into an open space covered with vegetation, from amidst which the two
                  turrets rise frowningly from a slight eminence, and with a degree of wildness in
                  the scenery around, that indeed raised in me a feeling of awe.
               An embattled wall, in the centre of which is the gateway, flanked by towers, and
                  surrounded by another bristling arch, connects the two towers. I went over the
                  drawbridge, through the gateway, which is beautifully clothed with ivy, entering a
                  passage which ushered me into the "Inner Court," where a scene novel and
                  bewildering was presented to me. Then I came to what they called the "Keep" or
                  "Mount," crowned with battlemented walls, and interspersed with a verdant mass of
                  foliage. To the left was the inhabited portion of the Castle with quite a modern
                  entrance. Then I saw the large windows of the Chapel, and to the right the massive
                  walls which bound the soft and verdant sward in their inclosure.
               I entered the Castle through the great hall, leading to the suite of apartments
                  shown to the visitor, containing paintings of extraordinary beauty and value of
                  Vandyke, Rubens, Michael Angelo, and any quantity of curiosities, etc.
               While walking about this room, a Servant entered carrying in her arms an infant of
                  some four months old. "That," said the steward-"is the future heir to the estate."
                  If he lives he will be the "Earl of Warwick." It was the infant child of Lord
                  Brooke, the son of the (then) present Earl. The nurse let me take the future Earl
                  in my arms. I patted his pretty face, said unintelligible things to it, and it
                  ended in the young 'un's setting up a squall like the war-cry of a Tuscarora
                  brave.
               Among many articles of interest, I was shown here the saddle used by Queen
                  Elizabeth, when going to Kenilworth, the Virginal (or Harpsichord) given to her by
                  the Earl of Leicester, with the Royal Arms of England on it, it is a very curious
                  instrument, somewhat resembling 'a banjo-a pistol given the present Earl by Col.
                  Colt of Hartford. Queen Elizabeth's
                  silver dagger-as also the bed upon which Queen Ann reposed.

               STRATFORD-UPON-AVON.
               AND now for my pretty little village of Stratford.
               How I peered out for that "Spire" of the church, where rest the remains of the
                  immortal poet. How I was charmed with the perfect quiet-the repose, the
                  tranquillity of everything as we entered the village, so beautifully described by
                  my friend Mr. Brady, in a speech that he made two years before-at the Dramatic
                  Fund Dinner,-as being "asleep!" for so indeed to me it appeared.
               How charming the quiet of the Cozy little front parlor, of the pleasant little inn
                  ycleped the "Golden Lion, kept by a right merry fellow I assure you, Mr. Henry
                  Heartly by name, and who very kindly offered to be my pioneer to the places of
                  interest in and about the village.
               Accordingly I first went to pay my respects to the "Red Horse," or rather to the
                  little parlor thereof, immortalized by Washington Irving in his Sketch-Book, and
                  as all good travellers ought to do, asked for the celebrated "poker" which he
                  called his "sceptre."
               The landlady very good-naturedly said, "Oh, sir! I'll fetch the poker immediately,
                  all the Americans wish to see that-but I have to lock it up to
                  preserve it!"
               Presently she brought it in, with all the pomp and ceremony imaginable-having the
                  words "Geoffry Crayon's sceptre" engraved on it.
               After wetting our lips with a draught of mild ale, we returned to the "Golden
                  Lion," (tourists, make a note and stop there) and dined.
               My landlord has the most perfect collection of theatrical portraits perhaps in
                  England-upon the walls of the room in which I was sitting, I noticed paintings of
                  the elder Wallack, Edwin Forrest, Macready, Kean, Booth, Charlotte Cushman,
                  Charles Kean, Ellen Tree, Farren, Faucett, Mathews, Elliston, etc., etc.

               After dinner we strolled to the house where the "Poet was born;" reaching it-I
                  stood for some minutes gazing with admiration and wonder.
               On a board, on a mean-looking edifice in Henly street are rudely painted the
                  words:-
               "The immortal Shakspeare was born in this house."
               I passed into the little shop, a dismal apartment indeed, with rough stone
                  pavement, and a lot of old iron hooks sticking in the wall-the place seemed to be
                  about eight feet square-presently out popped a little woman-a Mrs. Stanley; quite
                  a pleasant chatty body-very amusing indeed, and she really seemed to take great
                  pains in describing the relics.
               She said: "There 'av been four or five hof your countrymen ere to day, sur. Some
                  werry nice people, sur-you're from Hamerica, sur, I think-haint yar?" I assented.
                  "I knowed it, sur, by your 'at; you'll hexcuse me, sur, but the Mericans wear such
                  broad rimmed 'ats." We then went up a narrow dingy staircase to the chamber where
                  William Shakspeare first saw the light, on the morning of April 23, 1564.
               It is a moderate-sized apartment, very low roofed and dirty, having but one large
                  window in it; every inch of the wall, the door, the ceiling, and indeed every
                  available place was covered with names; she pointed out to me, Edmund Kean's,
                  Schiller's, Lord Byron's, Sir Walter Scott's, Washington Irving's, Tennyson's,
                  etc. I tried to find a place whereon to "fix" my humble name, but my pencil broke
                  when I commenced the "M," and it led me to think of the folly of it.
               How great the difference, I thought to myself, between the proud walls and
                  towering heights of the Castle I had just visited, and this humble dwelling! and
                  yet, when even they shall fall beneath the destroying hand of Time,
                  and crumble into nothingness, will this little spot be worshipped, cherished, and
                  revered-and his great memory be as green and fresh in the hearts of all, as when
                  first his bright genius flashed upon the world!
               Among the few articles of furniture in the house-none of which can be considered
                  as belonging to the home of Shakspeare-is a chair whose history has been
                     admirably bly drawn by Washington
                  Irving in the following words:
               "The most favorite object of curiosity, however, is Shakspeare's chair. It stands
                  in the chimney corner of a small gloomy chamber, just behind what was his father's
                  shop. Here he may many a time have sat, when a boy, watching the slowly-revolving
                  spit with all the longing of an urchin, or of an evening listened to the cronies
                  and gossips of Stratford dealing forth churchyard tales and legendary anecdotes of
                  the troublesome times of England. In this chair it is the custom of every one that
                  visits the house to sit; whether this be done with the hope of imbibing any of the
                  inspiration of the bard I am at a loss to say-I merely mention the fact; and mine
                  hostess privately assured me that though built of solid oak, such was the fervent
                  zeal of devotees that it had to be new-bottomed at least once in three years. It
                  is worthy of notice, also, in the history of this remarkable chair, that it
                  partakes something of the volatile nature of the Santa Casa of Loretto, or the
                  flying chair of the Arabian enchanter, for though sold to a Russian princess, yet,
                  strange to say, it has found its way back again to the old chimney corner."
               We visited the Grammar School, in which it is presumed he received his education.
                  Saw the desk at which he sat, the scenes of his youthful meditations-the sports,
                  familiar to him in early and mature life,-the site of the house, where, with a
                  sufficient income, he passed his latter years-and the church where his mortal
                  remains were consigned to the grave.
               I was then introduced to a Mr. Thomas Heritage, who is the fortunate possessor of
                  the "Marble Fount," used at the christening of Shakspeare.
               It is indeed a rare curiosity-kept at the end of his pretty little garden, and as
                  is the custom, we drank from it some wine, I (with his permission) cutting from
                  the pedestal some moss for presents.
               No money would buy this extraordinary relic: he has been offered for it large sums
                  at different times.
               Leaving the very friendly root of Mr. Heartly, I heard a man crying out something
                  about an "auction sale;" and having, once upon a time, done a little in that line
                  in Sacramento mento, I thought I would at least look on in Stratford;
                  and now, to give you-or Austins and Spicer, or Priests, Wilmerding and Mount, of
                  your city-some idea of the immense trade of this quiet little nook, I intend
                  giving you a verbatim copy of the bill of sale at the aforesaid auction. Here it
                  is:-
               
                  "UNICORN INN," "Stratford upon Avon. TO BE SOLD AT
                     AUCTION, BY MR. BROWN, ON WEDNESDAY JUNE 22d, 1858, The
                     following valuable property! viz.:

                        3. One Carpet Bag complete.

                           Scotland, New York, and the East Indies.
                     
                  
                  
                     Cards of admission to see the goods, to be had on immediate
                     application to Mr. William Savage.
               
               We then went to "Anne Hathaway's Cottage." Crossing the fields to the west of
                  Stratford, by a well-frequented footpath, brought us to the sweet little hamlet of
                     Shottery.
               Oh! how beautiful it looked, with its green lane, picturesque, timber-ribbed,
                  thatched cottages, babbling rush-fringed brook, and pretty wooden bridge. The
                  house is of timber and brick, two stories, with thatched roof, and looks like two
                  joined together. I looked up the central chimney, and saw the letters I. EL, 1697.
                  Up stairs I was shown an old carved bedstead, of the real old Elizabethan period,
                  supposed to be the one upon which Anne Hathaway slept. The room below shows traces
                  of the good old times; the rude stone floor, low ceiling, heavy beams, oaken
                  wainscot, and rough plastering. The wide fire-place, with the cozy chimney corners
                  and supporting beams, where the wood-fires must have often crackled and blazed on
                  the ample hearth. Here, too, was the seat, with the straight high f back, that;
                  rested on the porch outside the cottage, now quite porous with age-upon which
                  ofttimes, doubtless, during the long
                  summer nights, did our poet and Ms first love while away the hours; and who knows,
                  but upon this very bench, some of the most impassioned of his verses might have
                  been written.
               In coming back to the town, t strolled by the banks of the Avon-crossing the river
                  near to the church, in the chancel of which rest his remains. It stands on the
                  margin of the river Avon. You approach it through a long avenue of lime trees, the
                  boughs of which are so interwoven, as to produce a striking colonnade, and the
                  effect is peculiarly pleasing. To-day the weather was exceedingly beautiful;
                  little children were playing in the grave-yard, and dancing on the tomb-stones-the
                  pleasant low murmuring of the river was grateful to the ear-boys were fishing in
                  the stream, and birds were carolling away from the branches of the bright green
                  trees; and as I for the last time looked up at the pretty spire, towering to the
                  skies, I thought of the graphic words of Washington Irving, in his well known
                  "Sketch Book"-which, if I do not quite correctly subjoin, I most humbly beg
                  pardon, but I fancied them somewhat appropriate:-"How would it have cheered the
                  spirit of the youthful bard, when, wandering forth in disgrace upon a doubtful
                  world, he cast back a heavy look upon his paternal home, could he have foreseen
                  that before many years he should return to it covered with renown; and that
                     lessening spire, on which his eyes were fixed in tearful
                  contemplation, should one day become the beacon, towering amidst the gentle
                  landscape, to light the literary pilgrim of every nation to his tomb!"
               It had grown quite dusk by the time we returned to our little inn-the stillness of
                  death reigned around-by and by the moon was sweetly smiling through my pretty
                  gothic window, on the sills of which were some plants of geranium and mignonette,
                  and the fragrance of them was sweet to me-and I felt more and more the beauty of
                  my friend's words, that the little village of Stratford upon Avon was-asleep!
               In the book kept in the bed-room at Anne Hathaway's cottage, for the registering
                  the names of visitors, I found the following:

               July 13th, 1849. E, L. Davenport, America; Fanny E. Vining, London; Anna Cora
                  Mowatt, New York; James Mowatt, New York.
               "The three Americans above named hold their pilgrimage so far, as lightsome and
                  gay to find so much reward in being able to view all these early associations of
                  the 'immortal bard' in their land, if possible more adored than here.
                  In the above sentiments, the true born English woman 'Fanny,' begs to join heart
                  and soul."-Good!
            
            
               LII.
               THE "GABRICK CLUB."
               IT was my good fortune to be elected an "honorary member" of this celebrated club,
                  after a pleasant introduction to some of the members by Mr. A. Arcedeckne, known
                  as the "Commodore," and certainly some of the most agreeable hours were passed by
                  me there.
               The Club is situated in Hart Street, Covent Garden, and has more the appearance of
                  an old-fashioned private residence than anything else. Inside the appointments are
                  most comfortable and luxurious. Here you can breakfast and dine in the most
                  gorgeous style imaginable, and not only a great deal better, and with more comfort
                  than at a Hotel or Restaurant-but much cheaper.
               In the "smoking room"-a sealed apartment to all but members-you meet with some
                  choice spirits. Albert Smith, Walter Lacy, Lyster O'Brien, Shirley Brooks, Mark
                  Lemon, Thackeray, Charles Dance, Sir Edwin Landseer, were amongst the notables who
                  patronized the cozy retreat. Upon the walls are some superb paintings-presented to
                  the club by some of its members-one I think by Land-seer, and the other by
                  Stanfield.
               I never can forget the great kindness experienced by me at the hands of all those
                  whom I had the honor of meeting here-but as I have some further reminiscences of
                  this delightful association, occurring during my second visit to England in 1858,
                  shall refrain from any further "Jottings" until that time.
            
            
               
               LIII.
               THE LITTLE CHAPEL IN CANNON STREET.
               IN this street, not far from the celebrated "London stone," and at the end of a
                  little court yard, you will read the words "Salter's hall
                  Chapel"
               It was raining hard on Saturday afternoon. I had to meet a friend in the vicinity
                  of London Bridge, and being a little earlier than the hour appointed, I strolled
                  along this well known thoroughfare, and rested at the gateway of the little court
                  leading to the chapel.
               I have always cherished the greatest fondness for old scenes, old faces, and
                  associations, and though I had not set my foot upon the stones of that courtyard
                  since I was fourteen years of age, I seemed led by an impulse I could not resist
                  to revisit the well remembered spot.
               The reader will be kind enough to understand-if he or she is interested in these
                  memoirs, that the last time I had visited this place of worship was
                  with my beloved mother, and the particular occasion I cannot forget, for it was
                  upon her leaving the chapel with me, after the morning service-and for the
                     last time in her life, that the first symptoms appeared of the
                  disease which carried her to her grave.
               
               Everything in the little chapel was unchanged-the green baize door opened
                  freely-and there was the selfsame pulpit-its cushion covered with "brown holland"
                  to preserve it from the dust of the week,-the vestry, with its framework of
                  glass-the clerk's place with raised desk-and there were the pews-the one she
                  occupied-but where-oh, where are the worshippers!
               I walked up the aisle, as if led by an unseen hand, and stopped at the pew, where
                  so often I had sat with her-the cushions, hassocks, and little box for the bible
                  and hymn book, seemed to be; just as I had left them; the rain pattered against
                  the window panes, and the moaning of the wind was a fitting accompaniment to the
                  gloom around me, and my own thoughts.
               Seventeen years have passed away, since I was with her, whom I loved better than
                  all the world beside, on that very seat.
               Oh! how the changes, the vanities, the toils, trials, vexations-and even the
                  aspirations of my life, vanished into thin air, in the meditations of that quiet
                  scene; the past was only a dream-the future a mystery-and in the present, I seemed
                  to be bathing once again in the fountains of youth-the memories of whose bright
                  era were now so strikingly awakened.
               I could hear again the little quiet voice with which she joined in
                  the congregational hymn (for there were no paid singers there); the
                  attentive look at the minister, the moist ened eye, the head bent low at the time
                  of prayer, I then beheld again, and placed my hand upon the book of hymns that she
                  had so often touched; I opened it, and bursting into tears, felt that we were
                  again reading it together!
               Oh! if for those who have gone before to the other and the better land, it is
                  permitted, either in spirit to revisit, or from their heavenly dwelling to behold,
                  those whom they loved in life, she, whose pious teachings and tender solicitude
                  were then renewed within me-she, whose hand in the dread hour of dissolution I was
                  the last to clasp, the last to feel its pressure in return-she, from the "fields
                  of light above," must have felt that the seed sown by her affectionate
                  counsellings had not been entirely wasted, and that the promises of youth were not
                  altogether unfulfilled!
               I was awakened from my re very by the appearance of the old pew-opener, an aged
                  matron, busy in dusting the chapel for the service of the morrow, who, upon
                  telling my name and the object of my visit, appeared strangely affected.
               I passed out once again through the little green baize door, down the courtyard,
                  into the street, and stood at the gateway-alone. Her feet or mine will pass there
                  no more. I felt how little sympathy there was on earth. There I was, alone-a mere
                  speck in the crowded thoroughfare of that big city. But I reflected, in my
                  loneliness and desolation, that there were many, even among the noble and the
                  great, who might envy the peaceful sensations and holy emotions aroused within me
                  while revisiting "The Little Chapel in Cannon Street"
            
            
               
               LIV.
               LONDON TO PARIS.
               FRIDAY, April 8, 1853, started for Paris, by the way of Dover and Calais.
               I left the London Station at about nine in the morning, and arrived at the hotel
                  in Paris at about eleven o'clock at night-a distance of about 315 miles, costing
                  about 3. To Dover it is 80 miles, and took two hours; over the channel, 23 miles,
                  in about two hours; from Calais, through Lille, Amiens, and lots of smaller towns,
                  the train reaching Paris a little before eleven o'clock.
               I went first to the Hotel Maurice, but finding it uncomfortably full, proceeded to
                  the Hotel Choiseul, kept, and capitally too, by Morin, at 325 Rue St. Honor, very
                  near the Place Vendme.
               Now there is so much to dazzle; bewilder, and delight one in this city of cities,
                  that I find it difficult to know of what first to write, or to give any particular
                  description of my impressions.
               It would take a residence of several months-I was going to say years-to appreciate
                  fully the wonders of this mighty capital; consequently, one passing only a few
                  days therein cannot be expected to know much about it.
               First of all, I would advise the visitor, upon the morning of his arrival, to
                  consult the article headed Strangers' Diary, in the daily English newspaper called
                  Galignani's Messenger, taken at all the principal hotels, and whatever is to be
                  seen on the day of publication is invariably mentioned.
               My first effort was to find out the whereabouts of my nephew, a student of
                  medicine, in the quarter of the town called the Rue de l'Odeon. Succeeding in the
                  search, we "peregrinated" together "sight-seeing."
               We first went to the Louvre and Luxembourg gardens and palaces, Readers will be
                  surprised when they are informed that only a few hours were devoted to these
                  renowned places of curiosities and art; but the fact is, I never had any especial
                  taste for galleries of paintings, mosaic pavements, marble vases, or gorgeous
                  specimens of sculpture; and even if I had the inclination or the ability to go
                  into the details of a description of the wonderful things to be seen in these
                  ancient and renowned museums, it has not only been done so often before, but in
                  Galignani's Guide Book, which everybody possesses, a full, true, and particular
                  account is given; therefore, I shall content myself (and doubtless please my
                  readers better) by simply clipping from my Diary a "brief item" of what I "saw"
                  and "did" each day.

               PARIS NOTES.
               I DO not agree with my friend Belle Brittan that "the women of Paris are
                     not handsome." I think, as a general rule, that they are. But I do
                  agree with Col. H. F., that there is something indescribably neat, trim, and
                  fascinating about them; and that they take much more pains to please, in
                     little things, than either the American or English women; and to me
                  there is a certain indescribable witchery of manner about them wonderfully
                  irresistible, and a style perfectly enchanting. Comparisons, I know,
                  are "odorous," but give me a French woman before any other!
               Gad, it's enuff to drive any nervous man into 1853 fits a minute to look at 'em!
                  For take the veriest and most ordinary waiting maid, and even if not pretty, she
                  will have a deliciously fitting dress, with such a pretty little waist, and look
                  so trim, clean, and neat, with a little white "cap a 'top,'" put on so wickedly,
                  that it requires a "great deal of nice consideration," as John Brougham says, to
                  pass 'em by, without wishing them a happy New Year!
               
               The weather is now lovely, and oh! how shall I describe the beauties of the
                  gardens, the walks, the drives, the thousand and one sights of this earthly
                  paradise! Come with me for a moment to the Toolaries, now beginning
                  to look beautiful, the trees just out in leaf, all fresh and green, cut and
                  trimmed so as to form groves, shady bowers, and quiet nooks. Hundreds and hundreds
                  of chairs, and benches without number, invite yon to "take a seat," and every day
                  and evening, up to nine o'clock, it is filled with all sorts of pretty women and
                  children. Then the cham-d-Lyssees-whether on a
                  Sunday, or at night-equally strange, fascinating, wonderful. Charivaris, walking
                  theatres, dancing monkeys, vendors of everything, portable concert rooms, fitted
                  up gorgeously with flowers, mirrors, and bright gaslights, the singers "fixed
                  off," as if just going to the dress circle of the Astor, in days gone by;
                  half-a-dozen, or a dozen, complete orchestras, all firing away, and neither
                  putting each other out, and the whirl of excitement, the mass of people, and then
                  so much civility and order; no jostling, no rude "rubbing up" against you, no
                  shoving, pushing, as in London, no treading on the toes, without the
                  pleasant salve, "Pardon, monsieur!"
               Then the Bull-e-vards, o' night, with the multitudinous caffes,
                  thronged with men and women, the glare of gas, the brilliant shops, the myriads of
                  black, blue, and every colored eye, perpetually flashing upon you, the tightly
                  fitting little French boot, the elegantly turned ankle, the indescribable
                     raychercha way they have of raising the dress, about two inches
                  and three-quarters, as near as I can recollect, and last, though not least, that
                     walk-oh! my nerves, it's really orful, and I have to run down a
                  back street, to get out of the way, it's too much for poor human natur.
               Then the Theatres-all order and politeness-no fighting and rowdyism,
                  no scrambling for places-you just leave your glove, or piece of paper, or a
                  playbill, to show you have occupied a seat, and nobody disturbs it. Then the
                  acting, and the scenery, and the orchestra, and the toot-on-somble-oh Lord! it's ruinous. I have heard Der freyschutz,
                  'I Puritani, Sonnambula, William Tell, Lucia di Lammermoor, as I never expect to
                  hear them again-no boisterous applause-no hi-hi-ing-no ridiculous encore-ing-no ill-timed brava-ing, or
                  anything of the sort.
               
               The night before last I went to a place called the Jardin
                     Mobile, eclipsing anything of the kind I had ever seen-Niblo's is a
                     leetle in the style. Well, here were beautifully laid out, hard
                  gravel walks, just like marble to the feet-magnificent lamps, of variegated
                  colors, hanging from trees, and trembling in the air-fountains, beauteous in form
                  and design, gushing, spouting us, and watering plants and flowers, whose perfume
                  fairly intoxicated you. Seats and sofas formed of cut grass and moss-quiet little
                  retreats, and such cozy shady nooks; and then right in the qentre, in a kind of
                  Aladdin's palace, was the orchestra, while a portion of the visitors were enjoying
                  themselves in the giddy dance-waltzing, polkaing, or mazoorkaing, as
                  the fancy dictated. The admission was two francs-about forty cents. But the fact
                  is, there are so many places of the same sort here, that it is foolish to
                  particularize. Then the night was so lovely, the scene a perfect blaze of
                  enchantment and beauty, that it seemed as if Mr. Mahomet's heaven had broken
                  loose, and taken a fit to give us poor mortals the "latest style of the
                  fashions."

               LVII.
               THE FRENCH ACTOR LEMAITRE.
               
                  May 26.-To-day "Yankee Silsbee," the eccentric comedian, called on
                  me, and in the evening we went together to see the great French actor Lemaitre,
                  the original "Robert Macaire," I believe. He was performing at the Porte St.
                  Martin.
               The theatre was crowded, and going in late, we had a poor place. Our stock
                  (united) of French was extremely limited, although my companion informed me, that
                  he would translate the plot, &c., to me as the play proceeded.
               This was quite satisfactory, and by the time we were ready to leave the theatre, I
                  ascertained that an old soldier (one of the Old Guard, kind of "Maid of Croissy"
                  piece), with a knapsack, had just arrived from Morocco, I think, with a large
                  stick in his hand, and dusty shoes and gaiters; that he walked about until he came
                  to a table, and a stool-that he sat down, and with raised hands cried, "Mon Dieu!
                  Mon Dieu!"-that the audience applauded-that he then toddled off, looking very much
                  like Nickenson of the Olympic-that the audience applauded again-and this was
                  Lemaitre, the great French actor, as I am told he is, and which I do not of course
                  doubt. Well, it was something to have seen the man, and therefore my
                  thanks are due friend Silsbee for his conducting me thither, and translating for
                  me the plot.
               
                  A FAC-SIMILE OF A BILL OF FARE IN THE PALAIS ROYAL.
                  I used to dine very often in the Palais Royal, where are some capital
                     restaurants.
                  At the "Restarong de Paris, Galerie Montpensier, 23 Et. Roo Monpensier 18,"
                     kept by Godin, is one of the best of these, and on his bill of fare he has such
                     extraordinary English, that I asked for one, so that I might give a verbatim
                     copy.
               
               
                  
                  DINNERS FOR 2 FR. A PLATE.

               AN INTERVIEW WITH A CORN DOCTOR.
               I WAS in my bed the other morning, looking over a bundle of "Spirits," just sent
                  me from London, when a gentle tap, tap, tap, at the door, interrupted my pleasant
                  reading. Well, in walked a large, broad-shouldered, stout feller, about six feet
                  and a half in height, who, with a bow, and hat in hand, delivered himself as
                  follows:-
               "Good morning, sare."
               "Morning," says I.
               "I'se called to see you, gentlemens, as I vood vish to know, as you have any like
                  to have your caron (I understood him) taken
                  out?"
               "My what!" said I. "I don't understand you. You must have got into
                  the wrong room. Who are you? What the d--l is it all about?"
               "No, no, sare, my name is Doctare Koke-and I am ze first ca-r-o-n"-

               "What is that?" says I.
               "Vy (pointing to his toe), cor-un-vat you call c-o-r-u-n, eh! You no vat I mean?
                  for your toes? Now I take 'em out, as never vos, and they never com no more. I
                  vill show you ze patronage I has got, from ze first gentlemens and Lords of ze
                  vorld; and, sare, some Americans. I got a certificate of Doctare Permniman-you
                  know him, sare?-from New York"-
               "You mean, perhaps, Mr. Penniman," said I.
               "Yes, sare, that's him-Mr. Pennman; he gif me his certificate. I took out all his
                  coruns, and his family's, likewise out of the Prince Saxe-Meinger."
               Here is an extract from his printed certificate-
               "Dr. Kock, inventor of entirely new process for to take the radical cure of corns,
                  bunions, nails who have entered the flesh, without fear of return, or pain or
                  cutting, a few minutes in the operation being performed.
               "Dr. Kock has had the pleasure of employing and using his peculiar method upon
                  numerous patients, who, after years of suffering, have been enabled, after he has
                  operated on them, to walk with ease and pleasure, and wear the tightest shoe,
                  which ever could have been made."

                  THE BEST PLACE TO DINE.
                  The best dinner I got in Paris was at the "British Tavern," Rue Richelieu.

               HENRI HERZ CONCERT.
               
                  Monday, 18th April, 1853.-Strolling along the
                  Boulevards I met "Henri Herz" had not seen him since I sang at his
                  Concerts in Sacramento.
               We had a hearty laugh over old times, and inviting me to come to his concert on
                  the following evening remarked, that he didn't think I should see any rats running
                  across the floor!
               Next evening went to 48 Rue de la Victoire, where I found a brilliant audience
                  assembled. Heard for the first time, Tambtirini-was disappointed; fancied he must
                  be getting into the "sere and yellow." The tenor, Gardoni-good. Sivori (heard
                  often in the United States), superb (though not, I think, equal to Vieuxtemps),
                  Felix Godefroid, on the harp, perfectly enraptured the people. Laborde sang
                  delightfully.
               After the Concert, I was presented to Auber, the composer; had a
                  brief and pleasant chat about America, and an invitation to call and see him.
               
                  Wednesday.-Heard Sophie Cruvelli-to me one of the most fascinating
                  singers I have ever listened to in "Semiramide."
               Belletti was there also. The opera was superbly given. I have never heard such an
                  orchestra. On the following evening heard Der Freyschutz at the Grand Opera, with
                  Mad. Nau; and a portion of "Lucia," in which Mad. La Grange sang divinely, she
                  being called out five times!
               

               Left Paris at half-past 10, per rail, for Chalon-sur-Saone; paid two Napoleons for
                  a first class ticket (about eight dollars); dined at Dijon at 6, and arrived at
                  Chalon at 9-put up at Hotel de Parc.
               The French railways are admirable. The carriages comfortable and luxurious, the
                  conductors invariably polite, and the punctuality of the trains astonishing.
               As I left Paris my eye was charmed by the exquisite beauty of the scenery of the
                  surrounding country; snatching a hurried glance at the world-renowned Forest of
                  Fontainebleau, and envying the content and peace of the peasantry, so happy and
                  cheerful, women, men, and children working in the fields together, reminding me of
                  Macaulay's beautiful lines: 
                     
                        "Now let there be the merry sound
                        Of music and of dance;
                        Through thy corn-fields green, and sunny vales,
                        Oh! pleasant land of France!"
                     
                   And also of the rhapsodies of old Cardinal Richelieu, in the lines so
                  graphically given by Forrest: 
                     
                        "My island France! My wedded wife, sweet France!
                        Who shall proclaim divorce 'twixt thee end me!"
                     
                  
               
               
                  Thursday, 21.-Left in steamer for Lyons. The "Saone," a beautiful
                  river, a good deal like the Rhine. Scenery matchless.
               At Lyons, stopped at Hotel de Nord, to which place I and a Mr. Repka, of
                  Philadelphia, had been taken by the "Courier."
               Strolled through some of the silk factories, and accidentally "came across" my old
                  friend "Toot G--," of Philadelphia.
               His astonishment was great on seeing me. "Why, Pipes, where the d--l did you come
                  from? I thought you were in Marysville, California, buried in a gold mine!"
               Well (I replied), the fact is, I have been engaged by the manager of the Theatre
                  to play a round of my Shaksperian parts, and so I thought I'd open in
                  the most popular one, which is "Claude Melnotte," in the Lady of Lyons!
               
               "You don't say so," says he, "by golly, I'll come and see you to-night!"-
               I saw him about four years afterwards in Chesnut street, Philadelphia.
            
            
               LXI.
               LYONS.
               WENT to the Theatre; a beautiful building, fitted up elegantly. The orchestra,
                  consisting of about sixty performers, was capital-six violoncellos, four double
                  basses, twenty fiddles.
               I have forgotten what the play was about, but I know, that out of
                     France, I have never seen pieces so well put upon the stage-never heard
                  such an orchestra-never seen acting so good-and never looked upon such stage
                  scenery!
               
               Went up the heights of Fouvier, from which place I had a splendid view of the Alps
                  and Mount Blanc. Registered my name, and saw the signatures of J. T. B. and L. G.
                  C.
               Start for Avignon in steamer at six in the morning. Passed down the Rhone, gliding
                  by some of the most beautiful vineyards I had ever seen, arriving at Avignon about
                  four.
               This is a very ancient and antique looking city, and somewhat celebrated, I am
                  told, as being the Chateau of the Popes. We dined here very nicely, at seven
                  taking the rail for Marseilles, arriving there at half-past nine at night.
            
            
               LXII.
               MARSEILLES.
               STOPPED at Hotel d'Orient. On the next day, had a very pleasant interview with Mr.
                  Hodges, the American Minister, who invited me on the following day to dinner.

               Marseilles is a very bustling, business-looking city, and, I believe, the largest
                  seaport in France. The quays, docks, and wharves are swarming with life and
                  motion, and the fleet of vessels, and the smoke-jacks of a score or more of
                  steamships, is most refreshing to the eye of those who have passed the greater
                  portion of their lives in "big cities," and, as my friend "Col. Fuller" remarks in
                  his spicy book: 
                     "The city is flourishing under the new impulse given it by Louis Napoleon,
                        who is everywhere breathing the breath of life into France."
                  
               
            
            
               LXIII.
               NICE.
               
                  Monday, 24th April.-Left Marseilles at nine, per
                  Diligence, for Nice, Italy, travelling all night. Entered the Sardinian territory
                  about eight, Tuesday. Stopped at Hotel des Etrangers.
               I was delighted with this place, the situation right on the shore of the classic
                  Mediterranean. Perfectly beautiful.
               The weather at this season of the year was lovely. There are here about 40,000
                  people, among whom are many English, those whose limited income renders it a more
                  convenient place of residence than in larger and more expensive localities.
               The town is situated at the foot of Montalbano. This city and its environs are
                  greatly celebrated for a pure and healthy air, the climate even, I was informed,
                  in the middle of winter being very mild; accounted for by the situation of the
                  neighboring mountains, which are connected with the Alps, and protect the place
                  from storms.
               Start for Genoa at seven, again by "Diligence"-oh! horror! The scenery on this
                  route surpassed everything in grandeur I had ever dreamed of.
               28th April-Arrived at ten, and put up at Hotel de la Croix de Malte
                  sur le Port.
               
               This is emphatically a City of Palaces, through many of which I wandered, and was,
                  of course, delighted.
            
            
               LXIV.
               A REMINISCENCE OF GENOA.
               THE second day after my arrival I was fortunate to meet with a young Italian, from
                  Palermo, who spoke pretty good English, and finding that, like myself, he was
                  waiting for the Leghorn steamer to take him to Rome, we joined company, and I very
                  gladly availed myself of his offer to show me some of the places of interest in
                  and about this ancient and interesting city.
               He proposed first that we should visit the "Pallacini Gardens." These are distant
                  some four miles from the city.
               It is the country-seat of a wealthy Italian Marquis, and the house and grounds are
                  open for the inspection of visitors at certain times of the year.
               To give some idea of their vastness and extent, our guide informed us that five
                  hundred laborers and mechanics were constantly employed in the different
                  departments every year, making improvements and keeping the grounds in order.
               Imagine to yourselves, then, a palace of tne purest white marble, of the most
                  elaborate style of architecture, the main entrance to which is ascended by
                  innumerable steps of the same dazzling material, looming up, as it were, from a
                  bed of roses. The view from the summit was surpassingly grand, and my eye was
                  fairly feasted with every variety of scenery.
               Mountain, hill, valley, and dale-artificial lakes, with gilded and gaily colored
                  pleasure boats-water-falls, fountains, bowers of loveliness, cool and shady
                  nooks-exotics, and flowers of every name, odor, and color-aviaries of birds of the
                  richest and most glorious plumage, pouring forth the sweetest melody, fairly
                  intoxicating the senses.
               Sunday, 1st May. Left in French steamer for Leghorn: -Put up at Hotel Victoire, a
                  capital house, beautifully kept, clean beds, lots of water, large towels, civil
                  landlord, who speaks English (or did), and gave us a capital fare, and well
                  furnished rooms.
               My first intention upon arriving here, was to buy a "Leghorn hat," a thing I had
                  never seen since I was a boy; but failing in this, I was attracted to the Plaza,
                  to hear the finest band that I ever remember listening to; I refer to the
                  "Austrian"-composed of about a hundred musicians-each performer a professor of the
                  instrument upon which he plays.
               They stood in the middle of the Grand Plaza, by lamplight, the conductor standing
                  in the middle of the space, baton in hand-the band was composed entirely of wind
                  instruments-and played divinely.
               The following day went per rail to "Pisa," and (of course), up the Leaning
                     Tower! The scenery on the route was exceedingly beautiful, but upon
                  arriving we were beset by a perfect swarm of beggars, or, as they are called,
                  lazzaroni, half-starving, starved, maimed, halt, and blind, whose supplications
                  for "carita, signor, carita," beat anything I had encountered in Malta.
               The tower, it appears, was built in the twelfth century, and it leans eight feet
                  from the top to the base, and is reached by a flight of one hundred and ninety-six
                  steps. My sensations upon going up this slanting dicular tower were
                  most peculiar, and though it has been standing more than six hundred years, and
                  has braved the "battle and the breeze" in the shape of earthquake, storm, and
                  wind, I felt that it was going to fall down with my weight!
               At the top were large bells, rung upon the occasion of the execution of criminals,
                  or a fte day.
               We then went to the cemetery-the "Duomo," or Baptistery-returning to Leghorn at
                  four.
            
            
               
               LXV.
               CIVITA VECCHIA-TO ROME.
               FROM Leghorn I went by steamer to Civita Vecchia, put up at Hotel "Orlandi," very
                  good, and very expensive. This is, I believe, the only seaport in the Papal
                  States-and I should think it very fortunate for the residents of the dominions of
                  his Holiness, that it is so-for another such place would be the death of any one,
                  whose business called him thither; though Civita Vecchia is certainly one of the
                  numerous places which steam navigation has raised from comparative
                  insignificance.
               Numbers of travellers land here on their first entrance into Southern Italy; and
                  the lines of steamers which regularly touch here on their voyages between
                  Marseilles and Naples have given a slight importance and spasmodic activity to the
                  town, which it never could have acquired by any other means.
               I should imagine it to contain 5000 souls.
               They have a theatre here, and I saw La
                     Sonnambula very badly performed.
               Tourists are never permitted to land, until the captain has shown his papers, and
                  passports are carefully examined.
               Directly after we landed we were beset by porters; but we had made our bargain
                  before leaving the steamer.
               Two "pauls" (or 50 cents) for landing is quite enough. Before we left the town our
                  baggage was twice examined, amidst the greatest "fuss and feathers."
               These annoying and ridiculous impediments give an early acquaintance with the
                  greatest drawback to travelling in Italy.
               On Tuesday, May 3, I started by Diligence, at half-past eleven A. M., for
                  Rome-arriving at half-past seven in the evening-paying therefor 20 pauls or
                  $5.
               The first view I obtained of St. Peter, was about 17 miles from the city, where
                  the great dome loomed up in the distance like a big balloon-the postilion,
                  cracking his whip, and "hollering out" voil! St.
                     Petar!
               

               Now, I think I have before hinted to the dear delightful reader, that my visits to
                  all these wonderful places being very much on the "Will o' the Wisp" order
                  preclude the possibility of a very extended "mention;" and indeed, were it not so,
                  it has been done to "tatters" by thousands of tourists who have preceded me-and so
                  the "Eternal City" will be disposed of as follows:
               I had put up at the Hotel d'Allemagne, in the Via Condotti, kept by "Franz"-and I
                  was told, it was considered one of the best taverns in the place. I think I found
                  this the most expensive place I had yet visited in Italy; my hotel bill was about
                  $4 a day.
               The following letter I sent to the "Knickerbocker Magazine:"

                              cities and towns through which I have pass'd, I have seen in various
                              languages, the announcement of 'Uncle TOM'S Cabin' for sale, and in
                              two instances the name was spelled thus: 'MISTRESS, HARRIET BEATCHER
                              STOVE!' In PIEDMONT, I saw it akted, and the Italien who took the part
                              of UNCLE TOM affected the audience to tears, the women crying like
                              sixty!

                              cross, they say. I sor the POPE, who is a very mild-looking gentleman,
                              dressed in various colors. Peeple generally kiss his toe-I disremember
                              which one-but I didn't. He goes to Bed about eight bells, and gets up
                              immediately before breakfast. I visited the late residence of NERO and
                              TITUS, still standing. Some of the fresko's, though painted three
                              thousand years ago, are yet visible; they were done by various
                              painters, such as VANDIKE ROOBINS, Sir JOSHUA REYNOLDS, MICHAEL
                              ANGELO, TITMARSH, MOBELAND, ELLIOTT, INMAN, and RAFFLE. I am not quite
                              certain, but I think these are sum o' the names.
                           "Then I went to the VATIKAN-one thousand, four hundred rooms; sor
                              statuary, mummies, (no daddys,) regular original ones, done up in
                              linen; then I went to the theatre paid two pauls entrance, (ten cents
                              English;) the play was 'MARY, Queen of Scots;' didn't understand a
                              word of it, corse it wos hurried up in Italien. It appeared that Sir
                              WALTER REALLY got into a muss with Queen ELIZABETH, but I an't quite
                              certain. Then I went to the Pantheon,' or the 'Pantry' I forget which:
                              this wos built twenty-five years B. c., and is still standing: there
                              is a large hole at the top, which admits light and rain, sometimes
                              both: I think they show you the pew St. PAUL used to occupy, but I'm
                              not quite sure. Then I went to the arch of Mr.' SEPTIMUS SEVERIOUS,
                              carved all over in real stone; then to the Pyramid of CAYIUS CESTIUS;
                              then to the arch of CONSTANTINE, and Temple of VESTA, where the first
                              waist-coat was made; so they said, but I an't quite certain. I didn't
                              see any regular, real Romans, like they used to be in the old times:
                              they all wear tail coats, now, and patent-leather boots, and gold
                              shirt studs. I sor the Foram, but I don't think they were sitting; I
                              an't quite certain. On my way to Rome, having to stop at Leghorn for
                              two days, I took a run per Railroad to PISA, and went up the Leaning
                              Tower; and I fully expected it would fall down every minit, bekorse I
                              wos there, but I believe it is yet standing. Pisa is in Tuskany, or
                              Tuscaloosa, I forget which.
                           "Yesterday, I sor a copy of the 'KNICKERBOCKER,' of last month or the
                              month before, at the English Reeding-Room of Mr. PIALE, Number
                              Seventy-Nine, Piazza di Spagna, and there were half-a-dozen 'Merikans
                              waiting to get a sight at it. There was the nice blue cover, the
                              pictur of 'Old NICK,' in the easy chair, and in a moment, there came
                              to me such 'pleasant memories' of the past, of 'chats' and mild
                              'brewings' 'now and then' in the sanctum, of sundry visits to
                              Nassau-street, and the polite and gentlemanly Mr. H--, when a bright,
                              fresh copy would be handed me; and pleasing indeed to me was the
                              thought that I might soon meet you again!
                           
                              "Trooly Yours,
                              "JAMES PIPES, of Pipesville."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                   
               
               When I inform the reader, that I met a gentleman upon my first visit to the
                  Vatican, who informed me, that he had visited Rome regularly for eighteen
                  years-passing three or four months there each season-and did not imagine that he
                  had seen half of it, I need make no further apology for the brevity
                  of my remarks, considering, I fancied I had seen it in four days.
               
               My English friend was horrified when I told him of my flying visit. The other day
                  I got hold of rather a funny specimen of English composition. Here is a verbatim copy: it is the advertisement of one of the
                  Hotels: "Hotel Meloni, Rome. This handsome and extension hotel, situate on the
                  beautiful Piazza del Popolo, on the side of the magnifical walk of Mount Pinio as
                  also the benefit of being in most of its parts warmed by the sun near the English
                  church, and possessing fine points of view, together with the salubrity of the
                  air. The Hotel is directed by the proprietor himself who neglects, no, thing, in
                  his establishment, to reduce it, one of the most, comfortable houses in Europe, as
                  well for the distribution of its apartments, and finery of its furniture, as for
                  the uttermost cleanness, and reasonableness of prices, as so many Royal family,
                  and many other of equal distinction who have had the goodness of honoring it might
                  verify."
               On the 10th of May, I found myself again in Genoa, on the 11th I left, by
                  diligence and railroad, for "Turin," the most modern city in
                  Italy.
               Put up at the Hotel "Feder"-at the Theatre, I saw "Uncle Tom's Cabin" performed-an
                  Italian personating the woolly-headed African-and even with this
                  transmogrification-the audience were "moved to tears."
               Next day left for "Chambery," the capital of Savoy-crossed the Alps by way of the
                  "Mont Cenis"-bitterly cold-the scenery beyond description beautiful.
            
            
               LXVI.
               A SCENE TO BE REMEMBEBED.
               I SHALL ever remember a little incident that arrested my attention, upon reaching
                  one of the highest points of the snow-capped mountains of the Alps, where we for a
                  brief time rested to change horses.
               Now I like the Catholics: for to me, there has always seemed to be so much real
                  sincerity and heartfelt devotion in the followers of this creed-on the mosaic
                  pavements of the magnificent cathedrals, that in many lands I had visited, alike
                  kneel the rich and poor, the noble and the peasant, no "stalls" for the titled, no
                  $1,000 "pews" are rattled off by your fashionable "auctioneer" for his kid-gloved
                  and lavender-scented "communicant." Here they are all on a level-and let their
                  belief be right or wrong-they show, I think, by their profound and devotional
                  reverence for the Supreme Being when in his Temple, and by their charity for the
                  poor, the weak and erring, a brighter pathway to Heaven, than the followers of
                  many other creeds, who look upon them with derision!
               We were descending-the sun had just risen-steeping in the bright red light the
                  snow-capped hills, as far as the eye could reach.
               Our diligence had stopped to get fresh horses-and we were just on the point of
                  starting on our downward track, when from my seat in what they call the banquette or top of the vehicle, I saw on one of the
                  projecting pieces of rock, on the right hand side of the road, what appeared to me
                  to be the remains, or ruins of an old chapel, with a "cross" before it-and a
                     peasant woman kneeling there!
               
               Little did she dream that she was seen by mortal eye!-and thither had
                  she gone to offer up her simple prayer. It was intensely cold-and the danger and
                  difficulty of the ascent must have been indeed great. How intense the devotion of
                  a soul thus praying! how fervent the prayer-how sublime the spectacle-how
                  acceptable to the Omnipotent!
            
            
               LXVII.
               GENEVA.
               ON the 14th I arrived at "Geneva," and put up at the hotel de Corrane, on the
                  Lake, and felt like singing the song, 
                     
                        "I have crossed the proud Alps,
                        I have sailed down the Rhone," etc.
                     
                  
               
               
               Lake Leman lies before me, and from the window of this charming hotel the scene is
                  perfectly enchanting.
               One of the most interesting reminiscences connected with my brief sojourn in
                  Switzerland, was the following.
               I had rested for a day or so, at one of the little villages on the banks of Lake
                  Leman, near the far-famed town of Zurich, and I want to tell the reader of my
                  meeting with
               
                  THE LILY OF THE WATER
                  The reader is aware, that, in some parts of Northern Europe, the English
                     language is spoken; indeed, in many of the Swiss Hotels, it is quite common. I
                     was in one instance, however, fortunate enough to meet with a family who talked
                     good old Saxon, the head of which was the host of the pretty little village inn
                     at which I rested. Here, as in other lands, the children have their "May Day
                     Festival;" and, though I was not quite in time to witness their merry-making, I
                     was in time to inhale the fragrance of the flowers-in time to tell you of the
                     exquisite beauty, even though withered on the stem, of "The Lily of the
                     Valley." What a lovely day it was-as, looking from the window of my Hotel, I
                     watched the bright sun-beams, as they danced and sparkled on the clear blue
                     waters of Lake Leman! The breeze was crisping the waves, so that they danced
                     and gently tossed about the tiny boats, with milk-white sails, that glided on
                     its surface.
                  A very compact little vessel was hired for a moderate price, and as she
                     fluttered her wings to the wind, I seemed fairly to revel in the quintessence
                     of quiet and repose. The first summer rain had just fallen, and the valleys,
                     hills, and dales, refreshed by the showers, seemed to send up a song of
                     thankfulness to Heaven, while the trees, filled with blossoms, some just
                     putting forth their leaves, looking so green and lovely; and as far as the eye
                     can teach, it was one vast panorama of matchless beauty. On nearing a little
                     village, the name of which I have forgotten, not very distant from the
                     far-famed Zurich, whose waters have been immortalized in story and song, I
                     observed, as I thought, an unusual gaiety and liveliness of the people, and I
                     was about remarking to my companion that I imagined it was some fte day, when
                     he informed me we had f arrived just in time to see the last of the Swiss May
                     Festival. Children's sports are to me always interesting, and so away we went,
                     through innumerable groupings of lads and lassies, and vine-yards, bowers, and
                     gardens of surpassing beauty the air seemingly laden with the perfumes of a
                     thousand exotics, when, suddenly, in the distance the well known May Pole was
                     seen. But the dance had ceased; the little twinkling feet that so lately had
                     trodden on the spring blossoms, had disappeared; but the Lily! of the Valley
                     was there, and its fragrance was sweet beyond description.
                  A little blue-eyed girl, of some seven summers, had just plucked the flower,
                     and placing it in her bosom, began to cry. This attracted my attention, and I
                     went to her and asked her to tell me the cause of her grief. She said that her
                     little sister, whom they used to call the "Lily of the Valley," had been taken
                     from them, and she was going to send this flower with her to Heaven, to be
                     planted there! I need not say I became much interested, and followed the little
                     stranger for some distance; but, in the throng of children, I soon lost
                     her.
                  The little ones that, on my arrival, were grouped together in the very height
                     of glee and excitement, as I fancied, were speaking in subdued tones, while the
                     peasants looked sad and gloomy.
                  Musingly I strolled to the inn of the village, where I learned the cause of the
                     ceasing of the festivities. Here, also, had they a "May Queen," one they were
                     wont to call the "Lily of the Valley." For three summers had she reigned over
                     her little flowery band, when suddenly she was called away to bloom in the
                     fields of light above.
                  But listen to the story as they told it to me:
                  The sun never beamed more gloriously than upon the May-morn about which I am
                     writing; the last crowning of the "Lily of the Valley," and though its little
                     head was bent in sickness, the genial sunshine, it was thought, would revive,
                     and the merry-making and excitement prove beneficial, rather than injurious.
                     And so they placed her upon her floral throne.
                  
                  The shoutings of a hundred tender voices went up; processions were formed, and
                     garlands, wreathed by little hands, were tossed in the air. All eyes were
                     turned towards the throne of roses, and her crown of pure white lilies, that
                     she loved to wear, was placed upon her brow. She looked so lovely there, in her
                     dress of buds and blossoms; but she was very pale, and her eye looked up to
                     Heaven! Could she have heard them calling her away? She smiled so sweetly, she
                     could not be in pain; and then she tried to raise herself, but the exertion was
                     too much for her, and just waving her little hand, 
                        
                           "She fell in her saint-like beauty,
                           Asleep by the Grates of Light!"
                        
                     
                  
                  The color returned not to her cheek, and thus this tender floweret, in the very
                     height of its May Day glory, was taken to be transplanted into the heavenly
                     nursery!
                  The May Day dance was over. Garlands and wreaths of flowers dropped from
                     slender hands, that in their glee had held them-and tears flowed like rain;
                     and, where so lately smiles, laughter, and the joyous strains of music floated
                     in the air, sobbings now were heard, and rejoicings were at an end.
                  I thought it was a glorious way to die,-ere the young heart had grown familiar
                     with the paths of sin. While even the spring flowers budded, bloomed, and
                     blossomed on her very breast-while the shoutings of innocent voices greeted
                     her-her spirit passed silently away.
                  This is the story that they told me; and now I will tell you, my reader,
                        what I saw.
                  
                  There was no coffin-no pall-no raven plumings-none of the trappings and sombre
                     liveries of the grave, seen there;-but upon two pieces of cedar
                        wood, bound tightly together with boughs of evergreen and myrtle,
                     forming a sort of trellis-work, the body was placed, dressed in a garment of
                     plain white, with a single flower-the "Lily of, the Valley"-resting on the
                     breast The scene was most imposing. It was night; but the moon shone full upon
                     that lovely face; it was so light-so very light-it did not look like
                        Death. And, then, it seemed to smile, as though a pleasant
                     dream was her's;-or, perhaps, she was talking to the angels. And, then, each of
                     the children kissed those little lips, so still now, and cold, and their hearts
                     seemed breaking. I could hear their sobbings;-and they called her "Lily;" and
                     they seemed to think that she could hear them! and one said she
                     knew she smiled when they called her-but now she had gone to God to be a Queen
                     among his little angels! She was so very beautiful And then they sang a hymn;
                     and its distant echo among the hills made me think that it was answered by
                     cherub voices;-it was so distinct, so very clear, that it startled me;-and,
                     then, I saw them turn away and weep, for the "Lily of the Valley" had passed
                     from their sight for ever!
                  In connexion with the preceding, I have great pleasure in introducing the
                     following stanzas, presented to me by Dr. Keyes, the husband of the fair
                     writer, when on a visit to Montgomery, Alabama, March 10, 1859.
               
               
                  THE SWISS MAT QUEEN;
                  OR THE LILY OF THE VALLEY.
                  An incident related by Stephen C. Massett, in his travels in Switzerland,
                     suggested the following lines.
                  
                     There was not a bud or flower so fair
                     In Zurich's lovely dale,
                     As the gentle little maid, they called
                     The Lily of the Vale.
                  
                  
                     Three years a gay and youthful band
                     Had crowned her Queen of May,
                     Who ever hailed the coming
                     Of the glad and joyous day.
                  
                  
                     Another May-morn came again-
                     All hearts were beating high-
                     The air was sof-and brightly beam'd
                     The azure of the sky.
                  
                  
                     The maidens, with their garlands,
                     Had gathered on the green,
                     And were waiting for the coming
                     Of their loved and gentle Queen.
                  
                  
                  
                     Lily was drooping, but they thought
                     The sunshine bright and warm,
                     Would bring again to blooming life
                     Her fragile little form.
                  
                  
                     She came, and then they placed her
                     Upon her floral throne-
                     Decking her brow with blossoms white,
                     Flowers that she called her own.
                  
                  
                     She looked around, smiling with love,
                     Upon that fair young band-
                     But the bright and fragrant wand she held
                     Was trembling in her hand.
                  
                  
                     
                        Then, the angels must have called her-
                     To heaven she turned her eyes-
                     And her gentle spirit, upward borne,
                     Soared fluttering to the skies.
                  
                  
                     At night the moon in glory shone
                     Upon the scented bower-
                     Again they gathered to the grave
                     In the tranquil, silent hour.
                  
                  
                     A bier was made, all covered o'er
                     With flowers for a bed-
                     Again the lilies of her choice
                     Were bound around her head.
                  
                  
                     Queen of the angels, now she reigns
                     Queen of a lovelier throng-
                     And with that minstrel band above
                     She sings her May-day song.
                  
                  
                     Weeping, below, the maidens turn
                     From the dark and saddened scene-
                     No more they'll clasp in warm embrace
                     Their own loved May-Day Queen.
                  
                  ST. ANDREW'S BAY, FL. Feb. 19, 1855.
                  Back again in Paris. Been gone only twenty-six days, during which time I think
                     I have not been idle.
                  24th May.-Yes, while in London the big Tower guns are firing, and
                     hurrahs are rending the air; variegated lamps in the shape of V's and A's are
                     trembling and hanging ing from the house-tops-for this is Her Majesty's
                     birthday. While all this is going on, here I am sitting once again in my
                     pleasant room, after my rattling journey.
                  
                      
                  
                  Just returned from visiting the Museum, Palace, and Gardens of Versailles, and
                     therewith was I delighted. The day was lovely, and providing myself with a
                     valet de place, made for the rail depot, from which place we started at 10 A.
                     M. Versailles is quite a large city, containing, I am told, some 60,000
                     inhabitants. There is always an immense number of troops here; but of course
                     the principal object of interest is the Palace and Gardens, I accordingly made
                     the best of my way thither. Before we entered the principal court of the
                     chateau (if these French words are spelled wrong you and your readers will
                     pardon me) I was struck with its really beautiful iron palisading. It offers to
                     the view an extent of 117, or thereabout, yards, divided into eleven parts by
                     iron pilasters, terminating at the two extremities by pedestals bearing
                     trophies. The suns which surmount the gilt lyres decorating the iron pilasters,
                     are to be met with at every step in the different embellishments of the
                     chateau. Louis the XVL, I am told, chose this planet for his emblems. The
                     Palace is approached from the town by the Place d'Armes, about 800 feet broad,
                     on one side of which are the stables erected under Louis. They present
                     semicircle fronts, with courts inclosed by handsome iron railways, having lofty gateways, ornamented with
                     trophies, &c. They afford accommodation to 1000 horses. The Grand Court is
                     about 400 feet in breadth, and separated from the Place d'Armes by stone
                     parapets flanking an iron railway, richly chased with gilded ornaments, with a
                     central gateway, surmounted with the ancient crown and shield of France. At the
                     end of this railing are groups of figures in stone-on the right representing
                     France victorious over Austria-on the left victorious over Spain. In front are
                     sixteen marble statues of Richelieu, Bayard (I could not help thinking of one
                     of the editors of the Tribune), Colbert, Turenne, and others. In, the middle is
                     an immense equestrian statue of Louis XVI. It is magnificently executed. I
                     almost fear to say how many rooms I walked through, filled with exquisite
                     paintings; but I believe there are some four or five hundred. With the Chapel I
                     am particularly struck. The interior, I am told, was restored by Louis Philippe
                     to its original splendor. It was here that in 1769 Louis and Marie Antoinette
                     were married. The pavement is of the most costly marble, wrought in mosaic. The
                     balustrades of the galleries are of marble and gilded bronze. The paintings in
                     the Chapel of the Virgin are most exquisite. Service is chanted here every
                     Sunday morning. I went then to the Theatre. Fourteen columns, fluted and gilt,
                     separate the upper boxes, fronted with balus trades richly gilt. The other
                     ornaments are in crimson and gold, with lots of mirrors and chandeliers. This
                     is only open on presentation of one's passport and a small fee. I
                     then went to the Grand Apartments The king's are lofty and large,
                     encrusted with marbles, and loaded with a perfect profusion of massive and
                     gilded ornaments. The queen's are in white and gold, and look exceedingly rich
                     and chaste. But how shall I tell you of the Park and Gardens? Of the variety
                     and effect of the plantations and water, or of the immense number and beauty of
                     the statues, vases, and groups. Here are two beautiful vases in white marble,
                     ornamented with bas-reliefs-then come the oblong basins, upon the borders of
                     which repose, I forget how many, magnificent bronze groups. At the end of the
                     terrace are two fountains, adorned with groups of animals-all sorts of flowers,
                     rich and rare, are to be found in profusion sion. I could fill my sheet in
                     talking to you of this place of enchantment; but as I have other things to chat
                     about, let me leave Versailles. Come and take with me a quiet stroll into one
                     of the many beautiful public gardens of the Champs Elyses, I forget the name of
                        this one, but I am told it ranks first. Well, a light iron
                     frame front leads you to a spacious vestibule, the vault being supported by
                     eight columns, and from thence to a very large garden completely roofed
                        with glass. A range of iron pillars runs all along the interior,
                     supporting a light and airy gallery filled with lovely flowers, the space below
                     being laid out as a garden, with orange trees and all sorts of rare
                     exotics-great big basins in the form of enormous sea-shells, cascades, statues,
                     and groups; the bloom, perfume, and beauty of the scene my pen fails me to
                     describe. There is even an aviary here filled with beautiful birds, warbling
                     away; and in the centre of the garden a grassplot leading to a romantic grotto.
                     While the walls that connect portions of the iron framework are coated with
                     mirrors! Verily a scene did Mr. Pipes witness the other night. And though he
                     wandered gloomily and alone, through this, earthly paradise, yet he fully
                     appreciated the delicious situations of many of those around him; for, taking
                     advantage of the beauty of the night, the magic of the scene, the witchery of
                     the music, and the soft and inviting shades of the mossy bowers, than which,
                     nothing more lovely could he imagine Eden's garden to produce, were many of
                     both sexes, and "eyes replied to eyes that spoke again." It seems to me (to be
                     a leetle poetical) that words, breathed in places like this, come
                     with ten-fold power upon the imagination, and the guards to the heart are
                     unconsciously lulled to sleep, and the simple-hearted one is too apt to fall a
                     victim to the insidious arts of the vicious and depraved.
                  Once again-and perhaps for the last time-on the Boulevards! Oh, street of
                     streets, how shall I write about thee I Broadway is great-Regent street, Oxford
                     street, Piccadilly-are nutmeg-graters; but these same Boulevards are the
                     greatest. Countless numbers of trees on either side-the dazzling beauty-the
                     luxury of the shops-the restaurants-the lofty houses, some of beautiful
                     architecture-the crowds of well-dressed persons-the glittering of thousands of variegated lamps among the
                     trees-the sounds of music and the roll of carriages, all form a perfect medley
                     of sights and sounds to the eye and ear, not a little perplexing, though not
                     unpleasing to the visitor who walks there for the first time on a fine evening.
                     Forms, stools, chairs, in any number, filled with men, women, and children. You
                     pay two sous each for a seat. Then there are puppet shows, Punch
                     and Judys, pantomimes, rope dating, dancing, dancing dogs, anything,
                     everything! The scene, as I last evening took my farewell stroll, was
                     indescribably wonderful and exciting; a confusion of colors and images burst
                     upon my vision, the whiteness of the houses, broken at intervals by dark masses
                     of verdure, formed a beautiful contrast to the blaze of light issuing from the
                     splendid cafes and club houses, while the glaring gas lights without illuminate
                     the groups seated round the little marble tables; cabs, elegantly ornamented
                     coaches, and carts, rush almost noiselessly by, on the newly macadamized
                     carriage-way, and all seem perfectly entranced in the pleasure of idleness. How
                     I yearned to "parley-voo-de-dingdong;" but 'twas of no avail, and so with a
                     last lingering look I turned down the Rue de la Paix, to the Place Vendome,
                     into the R-o-o-o St. Honor, and thence to my hotel.
                  On Sunday I saw the Emperor-the late Mr. Louis Napoleon. He was on horseback,
                     dressed in a blue frock coat with a velvet collar, grey check trowsers with a
                     dark stripe down them, patent leather boots, and a shiny hat-that Genin brought
                     out for him. He looked pale, touched his hat occasionally, sometimes took it
                     off.
                  26.-Left Paris for London by way of Boulogne per rail. The place is a sea-port
                     in the channel at the mouth of the little river Liane. The upper town, or what
                     they call Old Boulogne, is built on the summit of an eminence, and encompassed
                     with walls. The lower town is partly situated upon declivities, stretching down
                     from the ramparts and the slopes of the beautiful hills which line the harbor,
                     flanked on either side by two long piers. The suburbs of Boulogne are indeed
                     lovely, and I should imagine that no continental town can vie with the numerous
                     advantages which it possesses; it is so near England, its situation and
                     environs so beautiful, and just for all the world like Rockaway; it has a sandy
                     beach, rendering it a most agreeable bathing-place and summer resort. Here,
                     during the season, are any quantity of English; and I assure you I feel, after
                     my journeyings, where for weeks I have not heard a word of my own tongue, that
                        at least I can understand and be understood, for, though a
                     French town, it is decidedly half English. Signs and sights like
                     these greet the eye: "Mrs. Susanna Taylor, Butcher"-"John Buck,
                     from London"-"Good Beds, 1s. 6d."-"Chops, Steaks, Liver and Bacon, Cold Cuts,
                     Brown Stout and Table Beer, The Era taken in-"Shaving
                     1d."-"Muffins and Crumpets," and the like. Quite refreshing this, after
                     reading, or trying to read, all sorts of jim-crack words and quirly-gigs! And
                     then you see "young" and "old" England to great advantage; see on the Pier o'
                     mornings and evenings short waistcoats, large feet, striped trowsers, short
                     bosomed shirts with three black studs, gaiters, narrow rimmed
                        'ats, a Murray's guide book, a spy glass, and a
                     thick stick; then you hear the Queen's Hinglish walked into pretty
                     considerably, such as "Wen did you git 'ere?" "I 'ad such a lark yesterday
                     harfternoon!" and "'ow did you like the hopperar, hay?" etc. But I like
                     Boulogne much-the hotels are capital, and I have been most kindly treated.
                  Just received a very pleasant note from Mrs. Henry Russell (the wife of the
                     celebrated vocalist and composer), inviting me to call at the Chateau Lettsom,
                     Maqutre.
                  Passed a delightful day there with her charming family.
               
            
            
               LXVIII.
               AN INTERVIEW WITH BRAHAM AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY-FIVE.
               AND now for an incident that happened to me at Boulogne. First, I would premise
                  that have been most lucky in my travelling companions, always finding some nice
                  gentlemanly fellow, who would, if I needed it, translate for me, or give me some
                  bit of valuable information. About
                  halfway from Paris to this place I found but one gentleman in the car besides
                  myself, and this one having the almost universal bit of "red ribbon"
                  stuck in his buttonhole, I felt satisfied it would be in vain for me to suggest a
                  remark, either about the "weather", or anything else; accordingly I folded my
                  arms, and commenced musing. My companion, however, asking me if I objected to his
                  smoking, changed the current of my thoughts, and I soon found myself chatting
                  away, on all sorts of topics. Accidentally mentioning California, I was asked if I
                  had met with a Mr. T--, of San Francisco, and upon my replying in the affirmative,
                  my companion presented me with his card, stating that he was his brother, and
                  inviting me very kindly to his house. Upon the arrival of the train at Boulogne he
                  insisted upon driving me in his very elegant carriage to the hotel from which I am
                  now writing, and through him found out the residence of a lady, whom years ago I
                  had met in New York, and who, when I called on her here, received me most
                  cordially, and it is she I have to thank for the great pleasure I afterwards
                  received, in calling on and passing the evening with the veteran
                  Braham! Yes, the veritable Simon Pure-the seemingly imperishable.
               Now I shall try and give you as exact an account as possible of what was said and
                  done, and as good a description as I can of his appearance-for he is certainly a
                     living wonder. There were present a Mr. Westmacot, brother he told
                  me to the sculptor, and uncle to an old acquaintance of ours, a doctor of the same
                  name, who formerly lived in New York; Miss Bolton, the sister of the late Mrs.
                  Braham, my friend Mrs. R-, her daughter and myself. I was not a little surprised
                  to see Mr. Braham walking about the room without any support-nonstick-and when I
                  was introduced he gave me quite a good shake of the hand, saying, in a most jovial
                  manner-" Take a chair, sir; happy to see you-we are just taking tea, will you join
                  us?-I want to chat a little about New York."
               He was dressed in black, and with the exception of being a little thinner than
                  when in New York, had not changed one particle in fourteen years; when I last saw
                  him he was standing on the steps of the "Astor," whistling for his dog!

               And he was actually letting grow a little moustache, which has an
                  indescribably ludicrous appearance on a person of eighty-five.
               Having with me the programme of one of my own concerts given in California, I
                  showed it to him. He took it, and though the print is very small, he read
                     every word of it-seemingly to wish to show us that he
                     could-without spectacles! He then turned to me and said-" Come,
                  sir, will you sing me a song?"
               "With pleasure, if it will afford you the least amusement," said I.
               Accordingly my pipes were set a going-and when finished-the veteran singer, going
                  towards the piano, said to me-
               "Now, sir, you have done me the favor to sing me a song, I will give you one of
                  mine!"
               He sang the "Death of Nelson" gloriously! I never heard him give it with greater
                  power and effect. It was a treat, I assure you, and was so unexpected. But I think
                  his reply to me, upon my asking him quite seriously, of course, if he intended
                     again visiting America, is the greatest thing on record-"Why, sir,
                  I can hardly say, but I may!!!"
               He spoke of many in New York-and of the old Tabernacle, where he made his
                  debut-said he was glad the Americans seemed to like Alboni so, and made this
                  remark, or as near as I can remember, in reference to her matchless voice. "I
                  never heard so fine a voice-it is like a gum-tree, sir-it oozes out
                  like, and in her pathetic passages would draw tears from stones!"
               He spoke too of our excellent friend, Mr. Timm, saying how beautifully he
                  accompanied. I passed a most delightful evening, and now, on leaving Boulogne I
                  would say-Go to the "Royal Hotel," kept by Mr. Hughes-capital eating and drinking,
                  excellent beds, and lots o' water and large towels.
               
               In this town, in 1848 I believe, the celebrated romance writer, Le Sage, died, and
                  was buried. Here also, in 1844, Thomas Campbell, the English poet, died, as did
                  Churchill also in 1700 and something.
               Some delightful walks, promenades, etc., are to be found here. The jetty seems the most fashionable,
                  especially to-wards the close of the evening; when, it is high water hundreds
                  flock to the pier, to watch the vessels as they enter or leave the harbor.
               Left Boulogne per "City of Paris" steamer, for London.
               On Wednesday, June 29, I left Liverpool in the steamship Atlantic, Captain James
                  "West, for New York.
               
                   
               
               On Saturday, November 5, I started on my second trip to California in the
                  steamship Illinois, Captain Hartstein.
               To be a faithful chronicler of my individual fortunes and misfortunes, it becomes
                  necessary to inform the reader (if he or she has had the courage to follow me thus
                  far in my biography) that, when I arrived from California, I had a tolerably fair
                  competency; and that with a little proper nursing, and prudent investment of my
                  "funds," I might take my ease for the future. Certain it was, that I had a larger
                  amount of "cash" than I ever possessed before, and I began not only seriously to
                  think of building a house in the Fifth Avenue, but of paying daily visits to Wall
                  street to look at the "stocks"-with what profit the reader shall presently
                  know.
               In those days there was a stock called "Madison and Indianapolis." Now, it was
                  suggested to me by a distinguished member of the "Board," that it was not only the
                  safest thing I could invest in, but that it paid a tremendous dividend, or "words
                  to that effect," as my friend Judge B-- says.
               About this time I had several thousand dollars in the Chemical Bank.
               (I always had a high regard for this institution, partly from the fact of the
                  highly respectable looking class of old fogies whose ingress and egress I had
                  often noticed, and partly from once having been nearly apprenticed to a chemist
                  and druggist.)
               The day I drew out my "balance" from this highly esteemed repository, was a sorry
                  one for me. I was the most wretched man alive, and I think I not only felt in my
                  pocket a hundred times to see if the check was there, but I walked up and down by
                  the door of the broker's as many more, before I presented myself at the desk of
                  the entry clerk.
               The stock, I believe, was purchased at 109-and from that moment it gradually
                  descended in the scale of railroad securities.
               The correspondence I have had in regard to this investment, would alone fill a
                  volume; and the agony I endured for months as, day by day, I saw the hopelessness
                  of my "case"in the lowering of the figure on the Stock Board-never having
                     once known the refreshing sensation of a "rise"-can be better
                  imagined than described. Indeed, it makes me sick to think of it; so I will simply
                  add, that this being the state of affairs, I resolved once again to woo Dame
                  Fortune on the shores of the Pacific.
            
            
               
               LXIX.
               ALL ABOUT "PIPESVILLE."
               IN the month of January, 1854, I made the purchase of a piece of land on the "Old
                  Mission Road," in the city of San Francisco, the full particulars whereof are
                  contained in the following sketch, written for the California Chronicle, then
                  edited by my friend, Frank Soul
               I think it is nothing more than fair, and justly due to my individual friends, and
                  the public in particular, that I should give a distinct, succinct, and faithful
                  account of the purchase, settlement, rise, and fall of the suburban
                  retreat yclept "Pipesville." In doing so I must go back to first principles, and
                  the reader will be kind enough to take a peep at me, seated at my desk; in the
                  office of Col. J. D. Stevenson, a little wooden shanty, surrounded by water, on
                  Montgomery street, where now stands the brick store built by J. B. Bidleman. It
                  was the month of April-say the first (most ominous incident!) in the
                  eventful year 1849. Now I had never in my wildest dreams of prospective wealth and
                  independence, entertained the idea of being the actual possessor of any "real
                  estate"-had never before cared to inquire the price of a "20 80" or "50 160" lot
                  in my peregrinations through the streets of dear old New York, or indeed in any
                  city, hamlet, or town, that I have visited in any part of the globe. I had
                  imagined; that "lots" were originally staked out and salted down by
                  Adam, as a first rate investment for future generations, should they "hold on"
                  long enough, and that by some genealogical hypothesis, the present "owners" had
                  obtained rightful possession. The reader can then in a small degree imagine the
                  excited state of my feelings, upon being informed, on a very foggy and misty
                  morning in the aforesaid month of April, that I was the actual possessor of
                     two lots 100 feel wide by 200 feet deep, in the "beautifully
                  situated" and flourishing city (!) of New York-of the Pacific! My first impulse
                  was to pack up my trunk-not a very difficult cult matter just then-consisting as
                  it did of only one suit of very seedy black clothes, three shirts, and one odd
                  sock, and proceed thence immediately and settle, as I was assured by the
                  enthusiastic proprietor that the trifling investment would be a fortune for me and
                  mine in a very few months, the property being so very near the proposed "City
                  Hall," the "Public Schools" (oh! Lord), and the "Railroad Depot," to say nothing
                  of their contiguity to the water, i. e. the city front! The deeds were made out
                  and duly corded," and by myself at that, for be it known to thee, my
                  worthy reader, Mr. Pipes, in those days, was a Notary Public, invested with all
                  the privileges, rights, and emoluments of that exalted, high, and honorable
                  calling, and by a no less distinguished individual than Brigadier General Governor
                  Riley, attested by H. W. Halleck, Secretary of State!-and for the curious in those
                  matters I have the original document to show them. I accordingly credited myself
                  with ten dollars, the price of recording, locked up my deeds in a large tin box,
                  purchased at a great expense of my friend Mr. Smith (now Smith Brothers &
                  Co.), and not only got up several times in the middle of the night to see if they
                  were safe, but foolishly thought every visitor that entered our office on business
                  or otherwise, came to make me "an offer" for them. I will not tell you how often I
                  have strained my eyes, in looking at a large map that was tacked up against the
                  wall (?) of our wooden shanty, to find out the precise whereabouts of my two lots,
                  until I had, in a feverish state of excitement, with my perspiring finger, made a
                  dirty streak all along the beautiful surface of this splendid specimen of
                  caligraphic art, drawn at an expense of $200 cash by my fellow clerk, Mr. Rowe!
                  How, with mouth wide open, I had listened (until I had swallowed a lot of flies)
                  to the startling accounts of several returned missionaries (to whom lots had been
                  presented by the liberal proprietor, upon their promise to build good and
                     substantial homes within sixty days!) who had well-nigh fallen victims
                  to the prevailing epidemic called "fills and cheever," or "tickled to death" by
                  mosquitoes! or how, in my own imagination, my property fell, when I found that
                  other purchasers were glad to back out of their first investment and "let it
                  slide," not feeling any desire to make
                  further payments-how it would again rise, upon hearing the Colonel state, in his
                  eloquent style, that it was the "head of navigation, and must be the grand
                     depot of all vessels bound to the Pacific! and that he had sent to New York for
                     'one hundred iron houses,' which would arrive before 'next spring' or 'the
                     fall,' I forget which!"-and with what mental anguish I used to proceed,
                  again and again, to the beach to look out for those ships, which were never heard
                  of or seen! But this suspense I could stand no longer, and accordingly departed,
                  one bright morning, in a small schooner, to look after my property. The crew
                  consisted of the skipper (a thorough Down Easter), two men, a small boy, and
                  myself. We were informed that the place of our destination was situated at the
                  "junction"-I'm certain that was the word-of the San Joaquin and the Suisun Bay,
                  rivers-that it was impossible to mistake the locality, as it was the head of
                     navigation! Our skipper (who had evidently expected to see a flourishing
                  town) had fortified himself with several large charts, quadrants, compasses, maps,
                  and telescopes; but on the tenth day out he seemed to be in great
                  doubt as to the precise whereabouts of the "city," and I noticed that he walked
                  the deck in a very nervous and excited state, muttering to himself in detached
                  sentences: "Well, neow, I swow, if ever yer ketch me on to another woyage of
                  diskivery sich as this, I'm darned! Whar in thunder is the plaice? I don't see no
                  bildin's-nor nothin! I guess we've got the wrong side o' the river!" Upon which I
                  pointed out to him a small hut, about the size of a hog-pen, suggesting at the
                  same time that probably it was the landing-place. Jee-roo-sa-lem!
                  cried out the capt'n, giving me a look not easily forgotten, and with a w-h-o-o-p,
                  and a scream of laughter, he tried to make for the landing. In doing this we were
                  nearly all drowned; how I got on shore I know not (the "lots" never entered my
                  head once), but I do know that I hollered out to some men to take me
                  off in a whale boat, I cared not whither, for what with the excessive heat, the
                  swarms of mosquitoes, and the utter desolation and dreariness of the prospect (?)
                  death seemed more preferable than a "stay" in "this horrible place."
               The schooner thought otherwise, and remains to this day, high and
                  dry, on one of the "water lots." My property was on the corner of C and Second
                  streets, right opposite the (imaginary) court house!-but the only vestige of
                  humanity, or of animal life, that I could discover, was one bullock's head, very
                  much flyblown, a very dirty looking Digger Indian, and an old shoe. The
                  improvements since that time, have not been of a very extensive character; and
                  though I still "hold on," it would be quite difficult accurately to arrive at its
                  present market value, or its precise location.
               
                  THIS WAS MY FIRST "REAL ESTATE" OPERATION.
                  The reader will be good enough to proceed with me to the Levee
                     City-Sacramento-and step into the office of "Priest Lee and Co.,"
                     on the corner of and Second street, who, at that time (October, 1849) were
                     immense merchants, land owners, and speculators generally. It was here then,
                     that on an October morning bright and early, long before breakfast (I'd 'a got
                     up in the middle of the night, if their office had been open), I laid $5,000
                     (five thousand dollars) on their counter, in good dust, for a lot twenty by
                     eighty on I street that had been sold some months before for $100; at the some
                     time I was quietly informed by my plausible landlord, that it would be worth
                     $20,000 in a few weeks. The second edition of the first flood soon
                     followed, the waters entirely covering my land outhouse! and I
                     barely escaped with my life, on the back of a large cow. that was
                     swimming down the street! I felt now perfectly satisfied that real estate had
                     received its death-blow, and that I had better sell out my interest
                     immediately. Accordingly I intimated to my excellent partner, Charley B., one
                     of the best fellows in the world-that he could take the lot back at a fair
                     price, which he readily agreed to, giving me the money. Now mark what I did-at
                     the old "Sutter Hotel," there was one day a large sale of "Real Estate" (the
                     water at the same time covered the entire city, do not forget that!) The
                     auctioneer, Col. J. B. Starr, was offering some valuable corner
                     lots on 7th and streets, emphasizing particularly usually in
                        his eloquent, and fascinating,
                     and glowing style, the fact of their being corner lots, the witty
                     Col. adding, "See, gentlemen, you can cut them up into sixteen beautiful
                        building lots-property must rise-after the water leaves
                     us-I assure you the depression is only temporary-millions are coming from all
                     parts of the earth to settle in this highly favored land-and this
                     is the spot they will choose!" Thus spoke my friend with the "hammer." I was
                     very wretched-knew not what to do with my money-I couldn't eat it-I had no
                     place to put it-and it wasn't a sufficient pile with which to leave the
                     country, and what to do, I did not know. Some cove bid $1,001 for the "corner,"
                        I bid $1,002. This lot I sold in about sixteen months after to
                     Jesse H. for $30 (thirty) dollars.
               
               
                  THIS WAS MY SECOND OPERATION.
                  I then bought two lots on K street for twenty-five hundred
                     ($2,500), and was at one time offered ten thousand dollars for
                     them, and ultimately sold them for eight hundred ($800).
               
               
                  THIS WAS MY THIRD OPERATION.
                  In despair, disgust, and a fearful description of mental torture, that I hope
                     never again to experience, I came down to San Francisco, thinking, perhaps, to
                     recover myself by making a small investment in a "water lot;" everybody
                     imagining his fortune made, could he obtain one. I accordingly, at a sale of
                     real estate of the property of Alcalde Geary, now Col. John W. Geary, made by
                     Kendig, Wain-wright and Co., (Ned Byrne assisting,) paid $100 cash for a
                     "valuable piece of property," as the bills said, somewhere near "Rincon Point."
                     This I sold for $120 to my friend Sam W--, and it is now (probably) worth
                     $50,000 or $60,000! Peter Simple title (clear and(confirmed).
               
               
                  AND NOW FOR MY FOURTH AND LAST OPERATION!
                  The purchase of the piece of land known as "Pipesville," situated near the
                     large marsh, right by the bridge, on Mission street, has entirely cured me of
                     any further desire to invest any extra change I may have at any time in "real
                     estate." I sicken at the very word-and yet I am not sorry I made the purchase.
                     The circumstances are briefly these. Upon my return to California in December,
                     1853 I still felt that I would like to take a small chance, once again, at
                     "Land," by which so many, since my absence from the country, had become rich;
                     and having at the same time more money than brains, I made my desire known to a
                     large and successful land owner, and personal friend, who, in reply, most
                     kindly remarked, that he would "keep me in his eye." This, I thought, most
                     liberal and considerate, and I felt perfectly safe, and sure of a speedy turn
                     of good luck. The day at length came, the purchase was made, and when with this
                     announcement my disinterested friend informed me (in answer to my query as to
                     the exact location of the property,) that there was a house
                     included in the purchase, my enthusiasm knew no bounds. The idea of
                        owning a house in this expensive country! I could neither eat,
                     sleep, nor drink; couldn't even wait for the omnibus, but footed it immediately
                     to Mission street, arriving at the "Bridge" in a profuse perspiration. Now the
                     only houses visible were Mr. Moss s elegant mansion, known as "Beverly Lodge,"
                     and some white cottages on the other side of the "creek," owned by some
                     distinguished members of the "stock and buckskin." Of course, I did not venture
                     to pull the bell of the lordly castle of the first mentioned gentleman; but I
                        did think that one of the three or four white cottages had, by
                     one of those peculiar twists and turns of California luck, fallen to my "lot."
                     I tapped at the door of one or two, inquiring if they knew of any sale having
                     been lately made of a valuable house and lot in that vicinity? When one of the
                     neighbors, pointing to a patch of land, seemingly in the centre of the swamp,
                     with a thing that looked like a pigsty in the middle of it, remarked, that a
                     Mr. S-- had the other day sold that piece of property, at P. and
                     D.'s auction rooms, and he presumed it was the house (!) and lot in question. I
                     instantly rushed, or tumbled down the hollow, to look at my purchase, and my
                     spirits fell ten feet deeper than the lot, which was at least sixty feet
                        from the grade of the street!
                      Still it was something; it had a
                     door, which actually opened; a window, with three panes of glass in it, and a
                     small bench in front to sit down on; and I consoled myself with the thought,
                     that it was a step, perhaps, towards a fortune, to be the rightful owner of an
                     establishment, even humble as this in California. Time flew by, my property did
                     not nor has it yet risen one cent in value, and I have bravely got over my
                     caring if it ever will. I do not now get up at early, morn, and
                     sit on the old fence, or the railing of the bridge, for hours together, waiting
                     for it to "look up." I indulge no more in vain and useless speculations as to
                     when they will commence, to say nothing of completing, the "Market
                     Street Railroad." I care not whether the "toll" is abolished or not; I would
                     not give a fig to know whether it is out of or in the "city limits;" or if it
                     is covered by the Bolting and Barren, the Ly-mantour, or any other claim. It is
                     sufficient for me to know that it is mine, by right of purchase; that it is all
                     paid for, and by money honestly earned by me in this great and glorious
                     country; that the "city and county" taxes are all paid; and that I have a
                     faithful and trustworthy German "retainer" (doubtless some exiled nobleman),
                     who is supposed to pay me one dollar a month rent (cash), but which, by some
                     extraordinary system of hocus pocus, I never receive.
                  And now, dear reader, permit me to tell you that your humble servant is himself
                     the nomeuclator of this pleasant spot. It pleased me to call it "Pipesville."
                     Have you any objection? And once upon a time I thought how jolly and cozy it
                     would be to have a little "cottage" of one's own, eh?-to read, chat, write,
                     smoke, and think in! The idea was no sooner entertained, than I found myself at
                     a "carpenter and builder's," and in a short time my little "snuggery" was
                     finished.
                  And here I am-not exactly rich, but, thank God, in good health, tolerably
                     happy, and at ease. From my little window, the view of the bay, the shipping,
                     and surrounding country-the range of hills of the Contra Costa, with the. high
                     peak of old Mount Diablo looming up in the distance, is exceedingly beautiful,
                     and I feel while dotting down these (perhaps to you tedious) random thoughts,
                     that there is something pleasant in life after all, and that a good many of us,
                     at least, are the makers of our own miseries. I am now a fixture;this is my
                     homestead-and from this snug little ten by twelve room, my friends, and the
                     public, if they please, shall occasionally have a "word or so" from their
                     obedient servant,
                  
                     JEEMS PIPES OF PIPESVILLE.
                  
               
               
                  P. S.-My "Ranch" was broken into a short time since, and this is to inform any
                     future thieves, robbers, housebreakers, etc., that there is nothing here of the
                     slightest value, nothing but my books, papers, and writing materials, which
                     ought to be left stationary. So they may spare themselves the trouble of again
                     breaking my door open. Should, however, they still persist, my retainer (a
                     stalwart German), who now sleeps inside, is fully prepared to give them a
                        warm reception.
                  
                  J. P. OF P.
                  Dated from my Rauch, "Pipesville," Mission street, San Francisco, Gal., April
                     20, 1855.
                  
                      
                  
                  Upon my return to San Francisco, I entered the law-office of "James Doyle,
                     Barber & Boyd," remaining with them some two years. Many and exciting were
                     the scenes that occurred during that period, some of the more important of
                     which I will briefly refer to.
                  Somewhere about this period, the greatest consternation seized the owners of
                     "real estate," in reference to the confirmation of the "different claims" by
                     the Land Commissioners.
                  
                  Now, as my property was purchased entirely unbeknown to me, by my
                     distinguished, disinterested, and wealthy friend, Squire P. Dewey, Esq.,-my
                     superior officer, Horace P. Janes, Esq., generously offering to advance me $800
                     of the purchase-money-I had not the slightest doubt as to the "title"-indeed, I
                     had no opinion about the matter either one way or the other. But it was
                     suggested to me, that there would be no harm in my writing a business letter
                     upon the subject to General James Wilson-a particularly worthy and pleasant
                     gentleman-and having preserved a copy, I herewith present it to the reader:
                  It appeared in the San Francisco "Herald" 26 January, 1856:
               
               
                  LETTER FROM MR. JEEMS PIPES TO MR. LIMANTOUR.
                  
                     "PIPESVILLE," Near a large Marsh, right by the "Bridge," Mission
                        street, Yellow Cottage, San Francisco.
                  
                  MY DEAR SIR:-The state of mind to which I am driven by the fact of the
                     confirmation by the Land "Commission Merchants" of your claim to all the lands
                     running from die Bay of Biscay to Point Lobos in the North, and to Mason and
                     Dixon's line in the South, may be by you conceived, but certainly cannot be
                     described by me; and I now take the earliest opportunity to state my case,
                     calling your attention first to my
                  
                     ABSTRACT OP TITLE:
                     which, though being rather complicated, and entirely unintelligible to
                        myself, may be sufficiently "satisfactory" (as the noble order of E Clampus
                        Vitus gentlemen observe) to you to induce you to respect my claim.

                        you to-"Read my title clear,"

                     The gallant General immediately sent me a "clear deed," and the proper
                        documents from Limantour-for which he will, at this late day, accept my
                        thanks.
                  
               
            
            
               LXX.
               A PIKE COUNTY WEDDING.
               ACCEPTING the invitation of a friend to join him company on a brief trip to the
                  "Sulphur Springs" of Sonoma Valley, on a bright October morning of this year; I
                  left this city of "wind and dust," for the quiet little town of Benicia,
                  proceeding thence to Napa, where of course (excuse the joke) I slept-arriving at
                  the "Springs" duly the next day.
               I found out at the Hotel, that a wedding was "coming off," or "going on" in the
                  evening, to which I and my friend were invited; and as it was my first
                  introduction into real genuine, Simon pure, "Pike County" society-it not only
                  amused me greatly-but I will try and give my readers the benefit of my
                  observations.
               About eight o'clock the bride and groom entered the room, looking pale and
                  agitated-but apparently completely resigned.
               It would have been a matter of very little difficulty to have driven a
                  moderately-sized horse and cart between
                  them, so great was the distance they stood apart The bride was dressed in a green
                  silk gown, very short-waisted-high-necked, with short sleeves-showing a pair of
                  red arms, with long hands attached, squeezed into a pair of large-sized "men's
                  8's."
               The groom wore a blue coat, with buttons that once were gilt-and (for it was warm
                  weather) light pants of a very dubious cut, with long straps, surmounted by a very
                  short waistcoat.
               They were then requested to seat themselves upon the sofa, which they accordingly
                  did, one at each end.
               The minister then stood up, placing a chair before him, poised upon two legs-and
                  leaning on the cushion, commenced the ceremony by saying, in the most peculiar
                  nasal tone of voice-
               "If thar air any parsom here who kneow any jest reson why these teou couple
                     shood not be united, in the bounds of holy wedlock, let 'em speak right
                     eout!"
               An awful pause ensued, interrupted only by the parson himself-singing out,
               "I pronounce you man and wife!"
               Then commenced any quantity of kissing-the brother-in-law of the bride becoming so
                  fearfully excited, that he rushed to embrace the bridegroom first.
               
               Soon after this, supper was announced, and the wedded pair proceeded to the supper
                  room.
               When seated at the table, the waiter asked the bride what she would take for
                  supper.
               The bride replied, "I should like ter know what you have got, first."
               "Beef and pork," says the waiter.
               "Well, I don't mind if I do take a small chunk of your pork," says the bride.
               The waiter rushed to get the desired "titbit," when a man, coming in an opposite
                  direction with a large dish of apple sauce, lumped up against him; both tumbling
                  down with an awful crash, the bridegroom turned sharply round, and wished to know,
                  "What on airth they were doing on?"
               Some fruit being on the table, the bride reached forth her hand to get some
                  grapes, when her husband, with a look of intense horror, cried out-

               "Ma-ree, don't yer eat them 'ere grapes, coz you've had the diaree, and aint good
                  for yer!"
               The reader can imagine the feelings of the company.
               Supper ended, they proposed a dance; the band, composed of one fiddle and a small
                  fife, playing the "Arkansas Traveller."
               We then retired for the night.
               In the morning, bright and early, a buggy was standing at the door, ready to take
                  the "happy couple" away.
               "Good morning, bride," said one of the ladies, as the blushing wife appeared.
               "I haint no wife neow neither" said she.
               "Well, that's a pretty compliment to your husband, anyhow," rejoined the lady.
               "Haint got no husband neither," said the lady from Pike.
               This the bridegroom couldn't stand, so coming up, he cried out,
               "Yes yer have, Ma-ree-I've got the certificate."
               "Whar?" says the bride.
               "In my trowses pocket!"
               A general laugh followed, during which the pair "bolted."

               SKEDADDLING OF BANKERS.
               WONDROUS land astounding were the events in the monetary and financial world about
                  this time. Bankers, monetary agents, exchange brokers "busted" entirely, and the
                  community seemed paralysed with the announcement that the banks had suspended.
               First went Page, Bacon & Co., then Adams, then some of the smaller fry, such
                  as the Miners'Bank, Savings Bank(?), etc.
               Some ludicrous scenes occurred on the 17th and 23d of February.
               At the first run on Page Bacon & Co., their doors were besieged, crowds
                  pressing in with looks of horror depicted on their faces, intending to draw out
                  their little all.
               
               Men, women, and children, cabmen, merchants, longwharf Jew slopsellers, piemen,
                  candymen, tailors, barbers, actors, priests, circus riders, water carriers,
                  omnibus drivers, editors, saloon proprietors, Frenchmen, Germans, Italians, Greeks
                  and Swiss, "fancy women,"-pushed, shoved, crowded, jammed, raved, and
                  stormed-bumping up against one another, the perspiration rolling down their faces
                  in streams.
               One woman rushed down in a cab, carrying with her two sacks in which to place her
                  cash. She leaped over the heads of everybody, and jumping upon the counter,
                  demanded her money, which was, as soon as possible, counted out to her; the amount
                  was ten thousand dollars, and she went on her way rejoicing.
               Some there were who, in their agony of doubt and suspense, offered to sell their
                  certificates of deposit at a great reduction; and I was told of two or three
                  instances, where five, ten, and fifteen hundred dollars were made in a few minutes
                  by an hombre, who had greater faith in the
                  "house" than the holders of their paper had, by buying up for cash, at a fearful
                  discount, their money certificates.
               I noticed some who were lucky enough to get their money out, even then, wearing
                  the most forlorn faces. They knew not where to go, what to do with it, or with
                  whom to trust it. Tip and down the streets they wandered, running this way and
                  that-the weight of the oro annoying and
                  troubling them.
               With uncertainty, fear, and trembling, they looked at all the banking
                  institutions of the city-who was solvent? "Mine Got, vat a guntry!"
                  sang out the Jew. "Sacre nom de Dieu!" cried out the Frenchman; while the
                  Englishman insisted, that "Hhif 'ed sent his money to Hold Hing-land, as Je hort
                  to 'a done, it 'ud been all right." In this the Yankee partly agrees with him,
                  except that he thinks "Uncle Sam's Treasury Notes would have been a
                     leetle slicker investment!"

               THE PANAMA RAILROAD.
               THE great event of the year 1855 was the completion of the Panama Railroad.
               Now, instead of the trouble, annoyance, and danger of muleback riding, you are
                  wafted from ocean to ocean in luxurious cars.
               No more rivers of mud, nasty mule traps, broken pieces of pavement-no more donkeys
                  perpetually stumbling over and against rocky, narrow, and dangerous defiles-no
                  more extortion of the filthy natives or the detestable steamers on lake or
                  river.
               These are now forgotten, and the eye is gladdened by the sight of the iron bands
                  and wooden ties of the rail.
               The completion of this railroad should be regarded by all Americans as a grand
                  national triumph.
               For a long time past the most powerful European nations schemed, talked, and
                  planned of the best mode of effecting this enormous undertaking; but it remained
                  for American enterprise and genius to complete, in a few short years, a work that
                  baffled the skill of the older powers of Europe to undertake.
               The name of John L. Stephens will never be forgotten.
               He first deemed the scheme feasible, and in the marshes and dismal'swamps of the
                  Isthmus he labored until stricken with disease and death.
               He was followed in this great work by Colonel Totten, of the U. S. Corps of
                  Engineers, as Superintendent of the Road, who first joined the enterprise in its
                  infant state; and most faithfully has he performed his duty; sparing no
                  energy-always at his post-kind, attentive, and humane to those under him, he has
                  won the sympathy, good will, and love of all; and now the great desire and wish of
                  his life is triumphantly consummated at last.
               Passengers cross now in four hours; it took me, in 1849, eight days!

               A BANK "BURSTS," AND I LOSE MY MONEY.
               AGAIN a victim. In the general panic that now seized hold of the banking
                  institutions, I found myself slightly interested, and without entering more
                  minutely into particulars (for the concern, on account of some private reasons,
                  shall be nameless), I will simply state, that by the "closing" of one of the
                  Montgomery street banks I was rendered penniless; and, at the suggestion of nay
                  friend J. T. D-- gave a concert at the Metropolitan Theatre.
               I believe it was generally conceded that a more brilliant assemblage was never
                  seen in San Francisco; and when the reader is informed that a number of my
                  personal friends took $50 of tickets apiece-to the amount of $1000-and that at the
                  door over $1500 were received, some idea may be imagined of the "quantity" of the
                  audience, to say nothing of its "quality."
               The success of this night determined me to give "public entertainments" on "my own
                  hook,"  la Russell, Dempster, or the late Albert
                  Smith; and as this fact changed once again the current of my life, and with a four
                  years' experience in various parts of the globe to the "method thereof," I wish to
                  say a few words to those who essay the task of giving "single-handed" or Monologue
                  Entertainments.
            
            
               LXXIV.
               MY FUTURE COURSE.
               IF any person thinks it an easy thing to entertain an audience for two hours
                     alone, let him go and try it-that's all!
               Now, I do not make this remark because I think I have been successful in
                  accomplishing this, or for the sake of self laudation, but to undeceive those who
                  vainly imagine that it is an easy or quick road to travel to obtain a
                  "fortune."
               "Fame" may possibly be obtained, but I think it will be conceded that a "fortune,"
                  as the result generally speaking of the peregrinations of a "wandering minstrel,"
                  is the "exception."
               Having determined, then, to adopt for the future the above mode of earning my
                  daily bread, I started once again for Sacramento, got out my programmes and
                  posters, secured the Rev. Mr. Benton's church, and was comforted by the following
                  pleasant notice from the Union, the leading daily journal of the city:
               "Stephen C. Massett, pioneer concertiser of Sacramento, poet, and by no means
                  unknown to fame as the author of many humorous effusions over the signature of
                  'Jeemes Pipes, of Pipesville,' is to give a grand ballad concert this evening. The
                  programme is brim-full of variety, consisting in part of comic and serious
                  readings, songs, selections from the poets, recitations and representations of
                  amusing scenes and characters, & c., & c. The versatility of talent
                  possessed by Mr. Massett is an undoubted guaranty that the entertainment will be
                  attractive. Mr. M. is contemplating a tour through all of the mining and
                  agricultural sections of the State, and has resolved to devote himself for the
                  future exclusively to this profession; and none who know the man will for an
                  instant doubt that it is the one for which he is in every respect fitted. The
                  concert is to be given in Rev. Mr. Benton's church, and tickets, which have been
                  placed at the low price of one dollar, are to be obtained at the music stores,
                  hotels, and the door.'
               It would be tedious, difficult, and, indeed, unnecessary, for the reader to follow
                  me, either to commiserate me for my losses or rejoice at my successes in my
                  subsequent trip through the Northern mines and Oregon, and I shall content myself
                  by simply giving a very brief account of my ramblings as a public
                  performer-relating one or two rather amusing incidents-until the period of my
                  departure for Australia.

               SOME OF THE TROUBLES OF A WANDERING MINSTREL.
               I THINK one of the most painful and decidedly uninteresting sensations experienced
                  by those resting entirely upon their own individual merits for the attraction of
                  an audience, is the one of doubt, as to whether there will be a large
                  or small number to greet him. Now, as I have felt this sensation in a greater or
                  less degree as often as most young beginners, the reader shall be initiated in
                  some of the mysteries of the feeling.
               I was at a place called Oroville, then a dismal looking mining town, but rich with
                  the "gold that perisheth," a few wooden houses, innumerable tents, any quantity of
                  lawyers, hotels made of canvas, streets knee-deep in mud, bar-rooms innumerable,
                  and of course a theatre-called the American.
               It was in this building that my "Concert" was to come off."
               I had been congratulated upon my arrival by several friends known before in
                  Sacramento, who appeared quite delighted at my advent, expressing at the same time
                  not only their belief that the house would be crowded, but the promise that
                     they would be at hand with all their friends!
               I suggested that it looked like rain, and that the streets were almost impassable
                  from the mud and slush, and that the "ladies" (I think there were about six in the
                  town) would find it impossible to "piroot" thither. To this they
                  replied, that that didn't matter, they all wore "jack boots," and cared nothing
                  for rain, mud, thunder, and lightning!
               This consoled me for the time. Now, I wish to inform the reader (and I know in
                  this I shall get the sympathy of my "professional brethren") that, without a
                  single exception, it has invariably rained on the first night of my
                  entrance into any new locality. Yes, from Botany Bay all the way to the Hanover
                  Square Booms, London.
               My "Hotel," if such it could be called, was "located" immediately in front of the
                  Temple of Thespis, and accordingly I could watch the pulse of the public pretty
                  well, without being diskivered, or subjecting myself to the vulgar gaze of
                     "Pike" a very peculiar institution in those days.
               
                   
               
               To those of my readers not exactly "up" to the meaning of the word
                     last italicised I would say that to the best of my information and
                  belief, there is a county of that name somewhere in Missouri, from which locality
                  many thousands have emigrated to California. Now, these "Pike countyans" are a
                  most extraordinary looking set of people, and though, I suppose, as the world
                  wags, there are as many "decent folk" among 'em, as in any other portion of the
                  globe, they certainly, in their appearance, manners, and talk, are entirely
                     sui generis, and unlike any other human
                  beings I have met with in my travels.
               The men are, as a general thing, hugely and squarely built, broad-shouldered, very
                  long arms, large coarse hands (whose "grip" I would ad-vice persons to avoid),
                     lanky legs, with a thigh so long
                  that when they sit down, half a dozen children could squat thereon with ease.
                  Their spare-time is occupied in "whittling" and "chewing,"-the "arm-chairs" in the
                  different bar-rooms, hotels, and "loafing" places, bearing pretty strong evidence
                  of their "cutting" and "slashing" propensities. They affect slouched hats,
                  generally with a hole in the top (either to hang it up by, or to let the wind in
                  or out), and turned up in front. Peeping from beneath a very ill-shaped and dirty
                  looking patched coat, you will see a portion of a dingy colored shirt, once
                  perhaps red; the nether appendages encased in a pair of tight fitting badly cut
                  "pants," the entire suit prevented from falling to pieces by a big leather "strap"
                  round the middle with a clasp in front with the letters "U. S." engraved thereon;
                  a knife, a pistol, and dirty buckskin bag for gold dust complete the appointments;
                  the feet-about the size of a small cradle-are shoved into the largest sized pair
                  of "high lows," sockless, and unwashed; the beard is worn, as nature originally
                  intended it should be, and the hair-of every indefinite color-is matted, shaggy,
                  and uncomfortable looking.
               Your "Pike" countyian is not very communicative, and is apt to look upon
                  everything and everybody with suspicion; seldom speaking to you, unless addressed
                  first, and even then his replies will be extremely laconic and unsatisfactory.
               A couple of these worthies, I noticed from the windows of the tavern, were reading
                  the "Poster" on the door of the theatre, and as I thought I could quietly walk by
                  and hear their views, without being "spotted" as the unfortunate "showman," I
                  crossed over the way, as though accidentally strolling by, when Pike No. I
                  relieved himself as follows:
               What in thunder's a "Ballad Consart?"
               Pike 2. Wall-a guess it's a "kinder show" and play acting.
               Pike 1. "By Jeems Pipes of Pikesville." Whar's Pikesville, I wonder?
               Well-guess we'll have to go-tickets two dollars. By golly-he'd ben glad to got a
                  shilling in Missouri!
               With this comforting consideration I returned to my "quarters" to ruminate upon my
                  chances of success in the evening.
               "Hotels," in the mining towns at this period, were peculiar institutions.
               The dining-room was immediately entered from the street door, the furniture
                  consisting of two or more long deal tables on tressels, with benches on each side;
                  up in one corner was a washbowl with a jug of water, a very dirty towel hanging
                  from the wall, and a comb and brush attached to a string, swinging to and fro like
                  the pendulum of a clock from frequent usage.
               A "Chinese gong," or an immense "triangle," at the hour of twelve announces to the
                  crowd that dinner is ready. Instantly a rush is made, and the greatest disorder
                  prevails. "Roast," "boiled," "baked," "stewed," "fried," fat and lean, disappear
                  with lightning rapidity, gallons of water are swallowed, plugs of tobacco are
                  thrust into the mouth, and the teeth picked with a large jack knife, and all is
                  over in about fifteen minutes.
               The "sleeping" apartments are not of the most elegant description.
               The one I had was furnished with a narrow cot, with a bed of straw encased in a
                  red blanket, a broken pitcher containing about half a pint of water, a quarter of
                  a yard of a dirty looking piece of cotton for a towel, and half an inch of a
                  tallow candle, stuck in a bottle, completed the furniture of the apartment. The
                  price was two dollars a day.
               The reader can imagine there was not much in the surroundings of my habitation to
                  inspire me with a very great deal of enthusiasm for the labors of the night Well,
                  the hour arrived, and the rain, as usual, was on hand.
               I mustered up sufficient courage to cross over about a quarter to eight, peeped in
                  at the door, and saw about a dozen fellows in the pit smoking, spitting, reading
                  the programmes, and one or two indulging in remarks not at all complimentary to me
                  (there was a woodcut of me on the bills, that resembled more the head of a
                  murderer, or disappointed pickpocket, as appears in the Police
                  Grazette, than anything else), some were gazing with intense interest at the drop
                  curtain, and speculating as to who, the
                  figures were intended to represent; one insisting that it was "William Penn,"
                  making the treaty with the Indians, another with a fearful oath knew that it was
                  Captain Cook, as he appeared immediately before being eaten by the savages, and a
                  third that it was Adam and Eve before being snaked out of the Garden of Eden.
               The last man was right-and at the tinkling of a little bell, our first parents,
                  the snake, the trees, Captain Cook and William Penn, were rolled up into as fine a
                  dumpling as ever faced a baker's oven.
               I had a "Melodeon" in those days (as pianos were difficult to obtain) upon which I
                  accompanied myself in my songs. Now this has not a very lively effect, either upon
                  the performance or the audience-the music emitted therefrom being a sort of cross
                  between an accordeon and a barrel organ-at the same time, I have to keep in the
                  wind by a perpetual movement of the right foot on the "pedal," ah: if for a second
                  I miss, the "bellows" indignantly resigns its office-the machine gives a feeble
                  and dying squeak-and I am left to the tender mercy of my audience.
               It was during a very pathetic rendering of the opening song, "When the Moon on the
                  Lake was beaming," that this fatal casualty happened-and to add to the miserable
                  state of my feelings-which I do trust will be fully appreciated by the reader-I
                  was requested to "dry up" by somebody in the pit.
               Now whether this suggestion had anything to do with the hydraulic nature of the
                  ballad in question, I know not;-but considering it was only the
                     commencement of a two hours' performance entirely unassisted, I
                  think my situation deserved some sympathy.
               I managed to "get through"-and though the affair was not pecuniarily
                  successful-upon the whole it went off very well-and upon each succeeding
                  occasion-particularly when my audience was of that peculiar quality, I gained
                  greater confidence, and cared less for the trifling annoyances.
               My trip through the Northern Mines was upon the whole a pleasant and successful
                  one.
               I visited "Shasta," "Downeville," (where I was very cordially greeted by my old
                  partner. Mr. now Judge Robert H. Taylor), "Grass Valley," "Weaverville,"
                  "Yreka."
               Crossing the "Trinity Mountain" by mules to "Yreka," this latter "City" is about
                  five hundred miles from San Francisco.

               LOLA MONTEZ.
               AT "Grass Valley" the late Madame "Lola Montez" was residing in a very picturesque
                  little "villa" guarded by a large sized "Bear," sundry dogs, parrots, cats, etc.
                  She and Johnny S-- received me very hospitably, and the evening passed with the
                  Countess of Landsfeldt, and the merry groups, there and then assembled-among them
                  were "Gus. S--"of this city, and Gil. M--, of Baltimore--will ever be remembered
                  by me with pleasure.

               OREGON.
               BEFORE leaving for "Australia," I determined to make a brief trip to Oregon.
               Accordingly on the morning of July 21st, I left San Francisco in steamer
                  "Columbia," for this remote portion of "Uncle Sam's" dominions.
               We stopped first at Crescent City, where I had the pleasure of greeting Mr. David
                  (now County Judge of Klamath) McComb of New York, then connected with Wells, Fargo
                  and Co.'s Express-the steamer coming to an anchor about three-quarters of a mile
                  from the beach in an open roadstead. The boat was lowered away, and we started for
                  the beach.
               In making a landing here (there were no wharves then), at certain seasons of the
                  year the surf is very dangerous, and
                  some most amusing scenes occur, particularly among the ladies, in their attempts
                  to land dryshod; and the Chinamen, in their passage to and fro from the mines, to
                  prevent their tails from becoming wet-for all Chinamen wear their hair very long,
                  and have a very religious horror of wetting it. The wind was blowing a gale from
                  the south-west, and as we neared the bar the prospect was such as to make us feel
                  very shaky. An amusing scene occurred in passing the passengers from the boat to
                  the steamer. Among the females was one from the rolling "Zider Zee," a delicate
                  miss weighing about three hundred pounds, more or less, including a small and ugly
                     dorg, who in attempting to be landed in the boat by one of the
                  officers, from the ship, lost her equilibrium, and with her arms about the
                  officer's neck, who was trying to disengage himself, both commenced a series of
                  gymnastic leaps, resulting in an immersion to the depth of some twenty feet in a
                  cold salt water bath. They rose to the surface afford roars of laughter, and after
                  some well directed efforts with boat hooks, etc., both were extricated.
               Crescent City was settled about two years since, and contains some five hundred
                  inhabitants. It is the depot for trade to the mines, which are located some
                  seventy-five miles in the interior. The place has one Church, a Theatre, a Hose
                  Company, two Express Offices, and many handsome Billiard Saloons, and I saw in two
                  or three places "The Spirit of the Times" on file.
               We next stopped at "Port Oxford." At this point there has been a Military Post,
                  under the charge, at present, of Lieut. E. M. FEELY of the 4th
                     Infantry, but the cessation of the Indian hostilities with Rogue River
                  Valley has led to the breaking up of the station. There are some one hundred
                  residents here, and business is quite limited. The climate at this season of the
                  year is mild and lovely. On the morning of the 25th, our steamer arrived at
                  "Astoria," made "classic ground" by the immortal pen of "Geoffry Crayon, Gent,"
                  and it carried me back to the days when "I first revelled in the beauties of the
                  "Sketch-Book," the "Legend of Sleepy Hollow," "Rip Van Winkle," and the book which
                  bears its name! This town is situated about twelve miles from the mouth of the
                  Columbia river, and will, I think, eventually be the sea-port town of Oregon. It
                  is now the port of entry for this Territory, and the Collector General, John Adair
                  (no relation to Robin!)is one of the oldest inhabitants, having resided here some
                  ten or twelve years. Lying a short distance above the town, upon a sunken rock, I
                  saw the wreck of the good old ship "Silvie de Grasse," formerly of the Havre line
                  of Packets, owned by "Bolton, Fox and Livingston" and singular
                  enough, one of our passengers had made a voyage in her to France seventeen years
                  ago! and there she lay (after buffeting for a quarter of a century the storms of
                  old ocean) stripped of her glory, a shapeless mass of timber; and where once her
                  streamers fluttered the sea-gull roosts, and the waters of the Oregon wail their
                  requiem.
            
            
               LXXVIII.
               THE COLUMBIA RIVER.
               THE Columbia river is really one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. I have
                  written from the Bosphorus, the Rhine, the Rhone, and the old Hudson, yet must I
                  proclaim from this distant region, the majesty, greatness, sublimity and beauty of
                  this the finest of them all! As our stately steamer moved gracefully through its
                  placid waters, in the far distance might be seen looming up the snow-capped and
                  gigantic mountains of "Hood," "St. Helens," "Jefferson" and" Ranier," forming a
                  superb contrast to the matchless and variegated colors of the hill sides and
                  plains. The banks for most of the distance are very steep, and covered from their
                  base to the top with tall and stately fir trees.
               The waters of the river are filled with fish of various kinds, among which are
                  great quantities of salmon; some weighing seventy-five pounds each. Located upon
                  the banks of the river, about eighty miles from Astoria, is situated the pretty
                  little town of St. Helens, at which place we stopped for supplies. There are here
                  about two hundred inhabitants, and it is at the point that the Pacific Mail Steamship Company have erected a
                  splendid stone house and wharf, at the expense of over $35,000, for the
                  accommodation of ships and steamers, in receiving and discharging freight and
                  coal. At "Vancouver's" we next stopped This is without doubt the finest location
                  for a city or town, of any I have visited, and the depot for the U. S. Troops for
                  the Territories of Oregon and Washington; and the 9th Infantry are at present
                  stationed there. Most of the officers of this Regiment have their wives and
                  families with them. I had the pleasure of shaking hands with Captain Wallen,
                  Captain Ingalls, Lieutenant Hodges, and many others. The officers of this garrison
                  are noted for their attentions and hospitalities to strangers. The parade ground
                  covers some twenty acres, and is elevated fifty feet above the river, commanding
                  one of the finest views of the surrounding country. From this point we proceed to
                  "Portland" situated on the Willamette river, from which city I am now
                  writing. The city contains about two thousand inhabitants, is prettily built, and
                  there are some four or five churches; three weekly newspapers flourish here, and
                  there are many schools, and one chartered Academy; there are also thirty-six
                  mercantile establishments, a large foundry, where all sorts of machinery are cast,
                  and indeed all kinds of manufactories abound here, and their owners making money.
                  There are six river steamboats now running from this city to various points on the
                  Columbia and Willamette rivers, and two new ones building.-A telegraph line
                  extends from this city to Coorallis, a distance of one hundred and fifty miles,
                  and the intention is to connect it with the Pacific Telegraph Line to California,
                  thereby forming a quick communication between this and San Francisco. I can hardly
                  believe I am writing you from "the continuous woods where rolls the Oregon," "and
                  hears no sound, save his own dashing!" which William Cullen Bryant, in his
                     Thanatopsis, writes about-yet so it is-and I feel I am further
                  off than I ever was before, from the dear old City of New York-yet something
                  whispers in my ear that there shall be more "cakes and ale," and a pleasant
                  shaking of hands, ere jet the "silver cord is loosened, or my pitcher broken at
                  the fountain!"
            
            

               LXXIX.
               ASTORIA.
               ASTORIA lies just within the bar at the mouth of the Columbia river. The location
                  of the city is advantageously made, but hitherto Portland has held pre-eminence as
                  the commercial emporium of Oregon. It has been gradually manifest, however, that
                  the navigation of the Columbia from its mouth to Portland, by vessels of the
                  larger class, would not continue to prove profitable, and the greater advantages
                  for sea-going ships and steamers which Astoria presents, must soon give a
                  considerable impetus to its growth and bring into recognition a new and important
                  commercial port on the Pacific coast of the United States. Already merchandise
                  finds its way to Astoria from Victoria and other points in British Columbia, to be
                  transhipped thence to San Francisco. The navigation of Puget Sound and the
                  Columbia river and its tributaries, is more economically accomplished by a smaller
                  class of vessels than those which are employed between San Francisco and the North
                  Coast. Astoria thus promises to become the chief entrept for the trade of Oregon and Washington Territory, and may
                  soon prove a formidable rival of Victoria, as the warehousing and distributing
                  point for a large portion of the English colonial settlements in the North. We
                  have yet seen no notice of the dawning future of Astoria. That it is a bright and
                  prosperous career which awaits that hitherto rather overlooked and neglected
                  little city, we do not doubt, and herewith offer our congratulations upon her new
                  birth into commercial consequence as one of the ports of the Pacific.
               At this flourishing little town I gave an entertainment, in the course of which I
                  introduced, as one of the "Readings," Bryant's "THANATOPSIS."
               I prefaced the reading with the following introductory remarks:
               The Poem I am about to read you is looked upon as the masterpiece of the American
                  poet, William Cullen Bryant, and it was
                  in relation to this gem (as I am informed by my friend Mr. Fitz Greene Halleck)
                  that the author of the Pleasures of Hope-the poet Campbell-remarked that had he
                  been its composer, he would have written no more, as he deemed this one piece
                  sufficient to immortalize any one.
               I fancy when Mr. Bryant wrote this, nearly forty years ago, he little dreamed that
                  it would ever be recited in so distant a region as Oregon-the name he mentions in
                  the poem-then looked upon as one of the remotest portions of the globe. But now,
                  how great the change!
               Civilization, and the indomitable will, energy, and enterprise of the American
                  people, have raised cities, where, but a few years since, naught was heard but the
                  war-whoop of the Indian, and the wilderness has indeed been made to bloom and
                  blossom as the rose.
               It was my desire and (if possible) intention to read this poem on the very
                     spot, Astoria, where first was heard the echo of the axe of the woodman,
                  breaking the solemn stillness of the hitherto desert wilds and forests of the
                  great Pacific shores-and my wish is now accomplished.

               A RUNNING TRIP FROM PORTLAND TO CORVALLES-ITS PERILS.
               
                  Monday, August 11.-I left for Oregon City at half-past two, on
                  steamer Jenny Clark. Day very hot-three passengers-boat couldn't get up to city in
                  consequence of "low water." I therefore had to get out and walk about half a mile
                  over some rough stones to reach a flat-boat, in which we were rowed to the town.
                  Oregon City deadly lively-made some calls-next day bought a horse for $200, and
                  started in company with Dr. Mcl-- for Salem, distant forty miles.
               Day lovely, and ride most pleasant-scenery varied-prairie, forest, hill, dale, and
                  valley. Stopped at a farmer's to take a bite and feed horses; farmer and family
                  very primitive and very peculiar. Commenced by eating two apples, then a piece of
                  very greasy pork, some bread-from a very original bakery-dipped in molasses, and
                  some good water:-asked for the bill, and found it was "six bits"-cheap and
                  nasty.
               Renewed our journey, horse rather rickety-stumbled often and shied-getting very
                  hot and tired-horse shied again-belly-girth broke, bringing me to the ground, with
                  one leg dangling in the stirrup-covered with dust, perspiration, and fright. The
                  mule upon which my melodeon was strapped, ran off-my agony of mind great-assisted
                  on my rosinante by Dr. Mcl--, and I, by the united aid of "main and
                  tail," managed to keep my seat. Donkey out of sight with box of music-rode faster
                  and faster-caught sight of donkey in a turnip field "grazing," with box of music
                  hanging by a cord-strapped it on again, and proceeded on our journey-arrived at
                  SALEM at half-past four. This is the capital of the State, and, like Washington, a
                  city of magnificent distances-succeeded in obtaining a piano, and the Court-House
                  for a concert. Wednesday-concert came off-people pleased-room lighted with six
                  tallow candles-puff of wind came and blew 'em all out-total darkness ness-eclipsed anything I had ever
                     seen before-roars of laughter-I was in the middle of singing "The
                  Light of Other Days"-people took the joke-I didn't think much of it.
               Started next day for ALBANY, on my horse-distance twenty-five miles-kept losing my
                  way, and finding it again-scenery superb-begin to feel myself a pretty good
                  horseman.
               Arrived at Albany about two o'clock-found a "city" composed of about seventy-five
                  inhabitants-saw two men cross the street-saw an ox-team, a tin shop, a
                  school-house half a mile from any habitation, and a "hotel" with nobody in it-saw
                  in the bar-room an old hat, a bridle, half a newspaper, and a horse
                  collar-knocked, and nobody came-knocked louder, and the result the same. Went in
                  dining-room, nobody there-saw two girls washing dishes in a wretched looking
                  place-asked 'em if I could have my horse taken care of?-she said, "didn't
                  know"-asked if anybody ever lived there, and if this wasn't a hotel?-she said,
                  "guessed it was, but the landlord was sick, and there was nobody in"-asked her if
                  she wasn't "somebody?"-said she "guessed not"-asked if I could have something to
                  eat?-said she'd see. I sat down most despondingly-gal set the table, brought me a
                  plate o' ginger cakes, a bit of rank butter, and a piece of meat on a skewer, that
                  looked like a dried rat and tasted like nothing at all.
               Horse stood outside and neighed hard-asked for bill, and found it, as usual, "six
                  bits."
               Met a man in a carpenter's shop (one of the leading citizens) who introduced me to
                  a "Doctor," who (another of the first families) told me that he would like me to
                  stop and give a concert, but he did not think he could "scare up" more than
                  fifteen or twenty persons. Thought I wouldn't "scare 'em"-thanked the carpenter
                  and tinman, who seemed to compose the town, for their kindness and attention, and
                  after trying to imagine a glass of root beer was a draught of Burton ale, I left.
                  Passed the jail with one man in it I was informed that a man was taken up at
                  Corvalles (of which flourishing city more anon) and sent to Albany for trial, I
                  think for stealing a sheep. The authorities managed to get him inside the jail
                  door, when he (the prisoner) immediately, let out two or three confined there,
                  knocked down and locked up half a dozen citizens, and "cut."
               Corvalles was reached at about five o'clock. Met Dr. Mcl. and H. G, who are
                  putting up a telegraph to run between this point and Portland. Found the town all
                  life and bustle; lots of good fellows, who welcomed me right heartily.
               Town situated on a magnificent plain, flanked by hills and forests and beautiful
                  trees. Healthful breezes from the mountains and the sea prevail all the time.
               Hotel life in this country is perfectly awful. It's no use-I can't eat "when the
                  bell rings." They breakfast in the middle of the night, dine when they ought to be
                  breakfasting, and take supper when they should be dining; and the "feed" is most
                  distasteful-all noise, dirt, grease, mess, slop, confusion, and disorder; chunks
                  of meat of all kinds, and no flavor, placed in plates, and "sot" on the table; and
                  before you have had time to look at your meat, a piece of a very flat pie, with a
                  doughy crust, and dried fruit inside, is placed under your nose, or on the same
                  plate with your meat. Men pick their teeth with forks and jack knives, gobble down
                  gallons of water, and "slide." This is the style in all the country hotels in
                  Oregon.
               
                  Friday.-Concert at Court House. Mrs. C-, a most delightful woman,
                  very kindly loaned me her piano. Eight men carried it on their shoulders; four
                  keys would not speak, and the pedal was quite out of sorts-managed to get along.
                  House was quite full-so was the moon. Went to the tavern, and tried to sleep;
                  rooms look like bathing establishments; walls of paper muslin and thin plank; hear
                  all sorts of noises and every variety of snore; heard a report in the middle of
                  the night like a subdued gun-smelt powder-a little scared about the Indians; put
                  my head under the red blanket (no sheet). A great big bat flew in at the window,
                  and I bawled out-thought it was a small negro-probably I was dreaming-awoke-found
                  no place to wash, so had to remain dirty; found a teaspoonful of water in a tin
                  cup-dipped my handkerchief in it, and imagined I had taken a bath.
               Shook hands with half the town, and left this really pleasant place, where I was treated with much
                  kindness and attention, in company with Commissary-General C-- and Dr. Harry G--,
                  together with a bottle of rooster-tail to sustain us on our return trip to Oregon
                  city.
               Passing through Salem and Albany, and when within three or four miles of Salem,
                  feared my caballo was giving out; began to
                  stumble, at last fell down, throwing me into the air several feet high-horse on
                  the top of me; he began to nibble the grass-I to take a "snifter;" doctor made me
                  a sling-thought there was no 'arm in that!-rest of the
                  journey I sat very gingerly upon my "hoss."
               Arrived at Salem, where I rested at the quiet and hospitable ranch of Mr. C. G.,
                  formerly of Washington city. Greatly indebted to him, also to Mr. and Mrs. G--,
                  for the use of their piano, and many others for acts of courtesy.
               Left on Sunday morning for Oregon city-day bright and pleasant. Met General McC--,
                  formerly a neighbor of mine in Sacramento-lunched together.
               General invited me to his house-charming family-slept and breakfasted there-got on
                  horse-glad (horse was) to get back after having carried me three hundred
                     miles!
               
               Left next day for Portland. Saw James O'Niel, Esq.-kind, genial, and
                  delightful-takes me around. Went to Fort Vancouver; stopped at Col. Thompson
                  Morris's quarters-most kindly received by the officers, one and all. Met Capt.
                  Wallen, Capt. Ingalls, Major Alvord, Lieuts. Hodges, Wicker, Withers, and olven;
                  as also Mrs. Wallen, Mrs. Anger, Mrs. D. Potts, and others. Society here most
                  delightful. Superb band plays on the parade ground night and morning.
               Here I also met the Rev. Dr. McCarty, celebrated in the Mexican War as the
                  "fighting priest," and who was at that time chaplain in the army.
               On a very rainy day at Buena Vista, he was heard to say, "Gentlemen, if you
                     must fight, it will be necessary to keep your powder
                  dry!"
               Saw a splendid breed of pointers at Capt. Ingalls'. The other day the Captain
                  killed and bagged sixty-five ducks in three hours!
               Gave a Concert in Company G.'s quarters. Thank Corporal Fox and Sergeant Fritz for
                  their services.

               Went to head-quarters of the Hudson Bay Company. Saw Chief Factor Graham; very
                  civil and courteous in showing me around. Gov. Dougal McTavish not in. Saw immense
                  warerooms, filled with all sorts of merchandise, from a toothpick to a bale of
                  cotton.
               Went to the Indian Reservation-saw some splendid "squaws;" went in steamer
                  Senorita to Portland, where I met my old friend Frank Panton, of New York; left
                  again in steamer Columbia for San Francisco. Thus endeth my trip to Oregon.
               On the morning of my departure, the True Californian contained the
                  annexed graceful farewells:
               
                  "DEPARTURE OF STEPHEN C. MASSETT FOR AUSTRALIA.
                  "We publish below a very graceful poem, by Frank Soule, addressed to the above
                     mentioned gentleman on his contemplated visit to Australia. We have been
                     acquainted with the veritable Jeems Pipes, of Pipesville, for a long time; and
                     since we have known him, we have learned to admire him as one of the most
                     gifted men in California. He is one of that band of pioneers who very early
                     immigrated to this state, and sought to tame its wild spirits by the
                     cultivation of music, wit, and poetry.
                  "Some of Massett's songs have taken a permanent place in the temple of the
                     Muses, and many of his sketches will last as long as the memory of the early
                     incidents of California life. He who has never listened to the adventures of
                     the Cockney gentleman, who got bitten at Hock Farm by a dog, and in San
                     Francisco by a Bank, has hitherto lived in vain; and none who ever heard the
                     sweet notes of When the Moon on the Lake is beaming,' as they have died upon
                     the lips of beauty, can ever forget them.

                     remember that the columns of the True Californian are always open to the
                     lucubrations of 'Jeems Pipes of Pipesville.'"

                     You're going far away, Steve,
                     O'er waters deep and blue,
                     The winds are strong, the voyage long
                     That you must buffet through;
                     But when the clouds are heaviest,
                     And breezes pipe most shrill,
                     Remember there are loving hearts
                     That think upon you still.
                  
                  
                     There's treasure in that land, Steve,
                     Beyond the Ocean old;
                     There may you float, and change each note
                     Of music into gold.
                     And warm hearts in that southern clime,
                     And true hearts will you find,
                     But none more faithful than a few
                     Which you will leave behind.
                  
                  
                     We'll think of other times, Steve,
                     And pleasures we have seen,
                     Though wind and wave around us rave,
                     And oceans spread between.
                     For though we are antipodes
                     The earth's full width apart,
                     There's but one language for the soul,
                     One climate for the heart.
                  
                  
                     So whether on the wave, Steve,
                     Or in the music hall,
                     My toast shall be success to thee
                     Where'er thy feet may fall.
                     Bright nuggets for thy stories, Steve,
                     And dust and lumps untold,
                     And every ballad bar you sing
                     Become a bar of gold.

               LXXXI.
               THE OTHER LAND OF GOLD.
               ON Monday the 8th of October, 1856, I took passage French barque "Fderis Arca,"
                  Captain Cassimir Heauvenu, bound for Melbourne, Victoria.
               Now upon the setting out of these, my Australian reminiscences, I wish to correct
                  a little geographical error, that obtains, both in California and in this country,
                  in relation to the localities of the different cities, and the colonies to which
                  they owe their allegiance.
               There are four distinct colonies, or states, as we call them, viz. New South
                  Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, or (as it was recently called) Van Diemen's
                  Land, and Victoria. Now, Sidney, the oldest city in Australia, is the capital of
                  New South Wales, Melbourne the capital of Victoria, Hobart Town, the capital of
                  Tasmania, and Adelaide that of South Australia; having enlightened the reader upon
                  this head, I drop until further notice my researches geographical, as my knowledge
                  of that illustrious science is about on a par with my attainments
                  arithmetical.
               By this time the reader will have perceived that I have been pretty well used to
                  the sea, and never having been troubled with sea-sickness, looked upon a long
                  voyage with about as much indifference as going up the Hudson river to Albany.
               This journey, then, with the exception of one other, about which I shall have to
                  say something presently, was one of the most tedious I had yet made.
               Of the passengers, there was hardly one with whom I could hold any communion, and
                  the captain, officers, and crew all French, hardly speaking a word of English.
               The vessel was small, badly manned, and wretchedly provided. Over the
                  cabin-passengers, of which there were about twenty, composed of mechanics and
                  their wives, and returning emigrants, I cast my eye in vain, after being at sea several days, for a genial mate;
                  the one hundred and fifty in the steerage resembled more the third class
                  passengers of an emigrant ship, and the appearance of things altogether was to me
                  most dispiriting and uncomfortable.
               I am not going to bore you, my dear reader, at this time, or any other, with
                  descriptions of a sea voyage, they are generally most monotonous affairs, and
                  particularly uninteresting at the time of their occurrence, or to be afterwards
                  referred, to, but an incident of so strange and exciting a nature took place on
                  this trip that I shall not hesitate briefly to endeavor to describe the scene.
            
            
               LXXXII.
               AN EXCITING OCCURRENCE AT SAVAGE ISLAND IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC
                  OCEAN.
               WE had been at sea about four weeks, and were enjoying the most delicious tropical
                  weather, such sunsets, such delicious moonlight nights, such steady and
                  invigorating breezes, when all of a sudden, we were becalmed, and almost within
                  hailing distance of an island, known on the French chart as "Danger," on the
                  English as "Savage," In the chart of the French skipper he was warned not to
                  approach too near the island, for the natives were not only most treacherous, but
                  esteemed to be the most savage of all the group of islands that dot the waters of
                  the South Pacific.
               At early dawn I noticed our captain apparently in a very nervous state walking the
                  upper deck, looking every now and then very uneasily through his glass, and
                  talking earnestly with the mate.
               In the distance land was plainly to be seen, and numbers of black objects moving
                  upon the water. In due time it was discovered that they were canoes filled with
                  natives; nearer, nearer, nearer they approached, when in due time a perfect swarm
                  surrounded our vessel.
               When I came on deck I counted one hundred and twenty of them.
               Such a sight I never before witnessed. In the first place the natives were the
                  handsomest specimens of dark humanity I had ever seen. Superb figures, very
                  handsome faces, with glossy black curly hair, entirely naked, save and excepting
                  an apron of seaweed and long grass extending from the waist to the knee.
               The first boatload had managed to scramble upon deck, gaining which the foremost
                  seemed instinctively to find out the captain, and instantly prostrating himself
                  upon the deck, kissed both of his feet; the rest, some twenty or more, were
                  busying themselves by jabbering with the passengers, laying hold of their
                  garments, and seeming particularly struck with the bright red of the flannel
                  shirts, and the figured cotton dresses of some of the women. All this time the
                  boats or canoes increasing in fearful numbers were surrounding the ship, and the
                  noise and hubbub of the savages, the cackling of geese, the cackling of cocks and
                  hens, and the squealing of pigs, added greatly to the general excitement.
               The captain, with sword in one hand and pistol in another, the mate being
                  similarly armed, by signs and gestures refused to allow any more to come on board,
                  and endeavored-after a great deal of trading had taken place between the natives
                  and the passengers-to clear the ship of the natives. This seemed to be an
                  impossibility. Now, it appears, that among the crew there was a New Zea lander, a
                  native of one of the group of islands near Auckland, who had been very busy with
                  one of the cannibals-there being quite a similarity in their dialects, and we
                  thereby were enabled to obtain some information relative to the intentions of our
                  formidable visitors-now every moment increasing in number by the hundreds, nay,
                  thousands!
               A dead calm prevailed. Apart from the evident and increasing anxiety of the
                  captain, some most laughable and amusing scenes were occurring upon deck-a native
                  with a squeaking young porker in one hand, and a string of cackling geese in the
                  other, would lay hold of, and even pull up, the dress of one of the affrighted
                  steerage passengers, and shaking the young swine in her face, intimate by his
                  gestures that an exchange would be accepted; remnants of carpeting, old
                  petticoats, and flannels, were eagerly
                  bartered away for all descriptions of live stock and "yams," and everything so far
                  had gone on peaceably enough.
               But a storm was brewing.
               I had managed to make out-though somewhat unintelligibly-that but one
                  vessel had ever before been so near this island, that but one white
                  person resided, and that he was a Catholic priest, that the natives were extremely
                  averse to the whites, and were excessively treacherous.
               We had been at sea some forty days, and the tediousness of the voyage was great,
                  and consequently the chance of a run on shore, and a sniff of the land, was most
                  enticing. The beautiful island with its countless cocoanut and banyan trees looked
                  most inviting, and the aroma from the spicy groves and wild foliage of the trees
                  was quite too much for my olfactories, and wooed me by its grateful incense to pay
                  a visit to the solitary and priestly occupant, and my respects to the inhabitants
                  generally.
               Obtaining the captain's consent, he first charging me to return as speedily as
                  possible, I left the vessel with the second mate, three of the crew, and the New
                  Zealander.
               I had provided myself with a very rusty formidable looking (unloaded, of course)
                  French horse pistol, and an old cutlass, had rolled up a bundle of old clothes,
                  flannels, & c., and strange to say, I had with me-thinking it might be
                  agreeable to the isolated stranger-a file of "Few York Heralds," and of the
                  "Spirit of the Times."
               Half an hour's pulling brought us to the beach, and the sight, upon gaining terra
                  firma, I shall never forget. The shore for miles seemed literally covered with
                  human beings; huts in countless numbers, and of all sizes and shapes, poured forth
                  their teeming inmates, and in the midst of this dense throng, stood forth, in the
                  habiliments of the Holy Church, the commanding figure and pleasant face of "Father
                  Glencairn"-for that was the missionary's name. For over seventeen years had he
                  been a resident of this island, and from the time of his arrival to the day of the
                  landing of our boat's crew he had not set his eye upon a white man. The reader can
                  imagine the interesting nature of our interview.
               All this time the natives appeared perfectly quiet and docile, and I was not only
                  struck with the handsome appearance and superb figures of the men, but perfectly
                  captivated with the almost ravishing beauty of the women, of a dark brown
                  complexion, with long waving and raven black hair falling to the waist in
                  profusion, over superbly rounded and voluptuously shaped shoulders, the waist
                  girdled most? tastefully with a sort of trellis-work of green leaves, which
                  interwoven with some aromatic herbs, sent forth the most delicate and grateful
                  odors, while the perfect symmetry of the limbs, the smallness and beauty of the
                  feet, completed not only a model of a figure, but such a one as I had never before
                  in all my wanderings gazed upon.
               The island was most romantically situated, and seemingly completely covered with
                  cocoanut and orange trees, while each of the curiously constructed huts or "grass
                  houses" was covered with grape vines, loaded with bunches of this luscious
                  fruit.
               A nod from Father Glencairn, and we proceeded with one of the chiefs to his abode,
                  and "chapel."
               
                   
               
               It was a building, if it can be dignified by that name, of "adobe," a sort of
                  baked mud, and the largest on the island. Inside was an altarpiece very neatly
                  arranged, resting upon which was a large wooden crucifix. Some wild flowers and a
                  few ornaments completed the furniture of the apartment.
               Myself and the priest were chatting very pleasantly, he having greatly interested
                  me by the recital of many start ling
                  and curious facts connected with his seventeen years' exile, when he remarked to
                  me that the handsome "chief" had suddenly disappeared, adding, that he didn't like
                  the looks of it; that though apparently he seemed safe enough, and well liked by
                  them, they were treacherous to a degree, hating the whites, and as savage as
                  demons!
               Upon my noticing the shouting, hooting, and hallooing of the natives outside, and
                  at the same time the agitated countenance of Father Glencairn, I confess I felt a
                  little "shakey," and regretted ever leaving our poor ship!
               At the same time I felt I had exceeded, by several hours, the time the captain had
                  told me to be absent; that I was at least a couple of miles from the shore; and
                  that if a breeze sprang up-such was the fright of the captain of being seized by
                  the savages-that he was certain to put to sea.
               I watched with the most painful anxiety the countenance of the priest. We were not
                  long in doubt as to their intentions. Beseeching me to remain perfectly quiet, and
                  not to exhibit the slightest trepidation, he told me to hold my old horse-pistol
                  in my hand (I had informed him that it was unloaded), and to stand by the altar
                  while we would "face the music."
               With a yell, that seems to be still ringing in my ears, they rushed in, but at the
                  lifted hand, and calm and dignified demeanor of the priest, they stood seemingly
                  abashed; in that terrible interval I seemed to have passed a whole lifetime.
                  Escape seemed impossible, resistance useless, and I felt almost certain that the
                  ship had departed.
               The sight of those magnificent-looking savages, with their handsome faces and
                  superbly proportioned limbs, almost bursting with frenzied excitement, and
                  carrying in their hands their wonderfully carved instruments of warfare, can never
                  be erased from my memory.
               There they stood, while the priest briefly translated to me their intentions,
                  still charging me to remain where I was, and to try and appear perfectly
                  indifferent.
               He also informed me that they told him the ship had been taken by them, and that
                  it was useless for me to think of leaving; he adding, to comfort me, that he
                  didn't believe it.
               Six of the chiefs approached nearer to me, each having in his hand a lance of
                  polished cedar-wood, when suddenly the priest rushed in front of them to the
                  altar, and seizing the crucifix, reverently lifted it on high, and falling on his
                  knees, directed me to follow his example.
               At this exciting moment-so seemingly were they under subjection-their faces not
                  only assumed their natural expression, but with bowed heads they slowly one by one
                  left the apartment; and of the hundreds of uproarious voices that a few moments
                  Before were shouting for the sacrifice, none were raised above a whisper.
               I certainly breathed freer, but the danger, my kind friend said, was not yet over.
                  We must hasten to the beach, for it was near sunset; we had some distance to go, I
                  had not seen or heard of our boat's crew for hours; and though for the moment the
                  natives seemed pacified, they were not to be trusted, and there was no time for
                  trifling.
               Upon coming in sight of the ocean, and seeing the ship lying quietly where in the
                  morning I had left her, I will not attempt to describe my sensations of joy. Our
                  boat and the crew were all safe at the landing; a very light breeze had just
                  sprung up, and the yo-hoing of the seamen, so grateful to our ears, warned us
                  quickly to be on board.
               I hesitated when the moment came for me to bid adieu to my kind friend and
                  preserver; and as he pressed his hand in mine, and gave me the parting benediction
                  of his holy church, and I felt that in this round world of ours we should not meet
                  again, I found it difficult to repress my emotion.
               I could not resist the temptation, at parting with him, of repeating to him a
                  verse from Robert Burns, that struck me as strangely appropriate; and though the
                  poet inscribed his verses to one whose head was circled in the jewelled coronet of
                  an earldom, it seemed to me that a halo of a richer and more heavenly lustre
                  rested on the head of the reverend father I was leaving now for ever:- 
                     
                        "The bridegroom may forget the bride
                        Was made his wedded wife yestreen;
                        The monarch may forget the crown,
                        That on his head an hour has been;
                        The mother may forget the child
                        That smiles so sweetly on her knee,
                        But I'll remember thee, Glencairn,
                        And all that thou hast done for me!"
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               LXXXIII.
               MELBOURNE.
               WEDNESDAY, Dec. 10, at half-past two, sighted the Melbourne Heads. At three took
                  pilot on board-blowing a perfect gale of wind; anchored in Hobson's Bay about six,
                  and shortly afterwards landed at Williamstown, distant from the city of Melbourne
                  about eight miles.
               One hour more, and I, by the aid of a carefully constructed rail car, had reached
                  the town, and was comfortably quartered in a very cozy room at the Prince of Wales
                  Hotel.
               Melbourne is decidedly a handsome city.
               I was struck with the beauty and the solidity of the buildings, the wide, well
                  laid out, and carefully paved streets, and the life, bustle, and activity of
                  everything and everybody.
               Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, stands on what they call the "Yarra Yarra,"
                  and is distant from Sydney about six hundred miles. The city is built on rising
                  ground, in a fertile and beautiful valley, extending for some miles along the
                  banks of the river-the latter yielding a goodly supply of fresh water to the
                  inhabitants.
               The population, I was informed, was 100,000,
               There are some very elegant public buildings, very creditable to the community
                  which has sprung up with such startling rapidity.
               One of the most notable structures is the Queen's Bridge, spanning the before
                  mentioned Yarra Yarra river, by a single arch of over 150 feet.
               This beautiful structure cost over $75,000.
               St. Peter's and St. James's are the most costly and conspicuous of the churches;
                  and the Roman Catholics have a very superb cathedral called St. Francis
                  Xavier.
               Independents, Baptists, Wesleyans, Presbyterians, Jews, and Quakers, have their
                  respective places of worship.
               There are three or four theatres, the Theatre Royal being the largest.

               The city is built of brick and stone. The handsome granite fronts of many of the
                  houses would be considered an ornament in London or Paris. The appearance of the
                  city from the river is most striking; the extreme ends rise over two picturesque
                  eminences, on the verge of a beautiful park. The general air of the place (with
                  the single exception of Sydney) is more thoroughly English than any other town I
                  have visited in Australia; and the superbly laid out grounds and beautiful scenery
                  in the suburbs have all the quiet, subdued interest of an old English domain.
               The three leading journals here are the "Argus," "Herald," and "Age." A "Punch"
                  also flourishes, very cleverly edited. Of the weeklies, at the time of my visit,
                  the "Note Book" was the most important.
               The government of Melbourne is vested in a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve
                  (so-called) town councillors.
               The city is also the seat of a bishopric.
               I had brought with me from California letters from my old associates of the press
                  in San Francisco to the Melbourne editors, and it gives me much pleasure, at this
                  great distance, to record the kind and genial manner with which I was received;
                  and also, if not too late, to thank them and the public generally throughout the
                  Colonies for their generous reception of me.
               The Melbourne "Argus" bears the same resemblance in that community to the "Times"
                  in London; and it, seems to be a pretty well understood fact, that by its censure
                  or praise the fate of a public performer is sealed.
               The reader will presently better appreciate this remark.
               Among those who greeted me on my arrival, were two Californians, Frank B--, of San
                  Francisco, and my old banking friend Merrill, of "Hensley & Merrill" memory,
                  Sacramento.
               We were joined by George Loder (who was, at this time, conductor of Madame Anna
                  Bishop's concerts), and had a "good time" generally.
               I found, however, that "Melbourne" was no place in to be idle. "Expenses were
                  frightful, and, as I was not altogether on a tour of pleasure, I
                  proceeded as quickly as possible bussiness.
               
               When my friend Bennett (who was most serviceable to me in arranging the plans of
                  my "first appearance" saw the "programme" I had selected, and that some
                  reminiscences of "California life" were to be given, he desired me to send him
                     twelve guineas' worth of tickets! This, I thought, was as good a
                  start as it was generous.
               The "posters" were upon the walls, the shops and houses were strewed with
                  programmes-the papers properly attended to-the "Hall" taken-the "Erard" (such a
                  beauty) selected-the ticket "taker" and "seller" secured-the "free list" duly
                  cared for-and the fatal moment of my "first appearance" before a colonial auditory
                  had arrived.
               Accordingly, on Monday evening, December 22, 1856, the brightly lighted hall of
                  the "Mechanics' Institute" was filled to overflowing with (of course) a
                  fashionable, and (to me) new and strange audience, although it
                     slightly rained.
               I believe it is proverbial that the Americans are infinitely more cordial and
                  generous in their welcome to a stranger, I mean, of course, a public performer, on
                  his "first appearance," than my countrymen are; but, on the other hand, the
                  English are less fickle and more lasting in their attachment, providing, of
                  course, a favorable impression is made.
               As a gentleman said to me in London: "Once make a 'hit' here, and your fortune is
                  made." But the great difficulty is to make the "hit," for out of the hosts of
                  entertainers that, for the last ten years, have sought to win the good favor of
                  John Bull, how few are they who have been pecuniarily successful. In
                  single-handed, or Monologue Entertainments, I suppose the late Mr. Albert Smith
                  and Mr. Henry Russell take the foremost rank.
               But to return to the "Mechanics' Institute."
               The audience greeted me kindly, though cautiously-laughing at the funny parts, and
                  crying at the serious. But it was not until, for the first time, I had given my
                  version of "The Charge of the Light Brigade" that I felt I had made a hit. The
                  audience rose and cheered, the women waved their handkerchiefs, and I retired
                  behind the little red screen, exhausted, excited, and thankful.
               Thus endeth my first night in Australia.
               The next day all the papers came out in the most laudatory tory
                  manner. The much dreaded "Argus" spoke as follows: 
                     Mr. Stephen Massett gave an entertainment last night at the Mechanics'
                        Institute, and the attendance was more numerous, and comprised a larger
                        number of the lite of Melbourne society than we have seen assembled within
                        those walls upon any similar occasion for some time past. A more clever,
                        versatile, and amusing mimic, vocalist, and elocutionist has not yet visited
                        these colonies. Mr. Massett sings and reads with equal taste and feeling;
                        his comic readings are really comic; and he can be pathetic without verging
                        upon the limits of bathos. He succeeded in exciting and retaining the
                        attention of the audience for two hours, and the manifestations were
                        frequent and hearty. His comic readings from "The Lady of Lyons," his
                        description of a novice's first appearance upon the stage in the character
                        of Young Norval, were the most successful of the humorous
                        portions of the entertainment; and Tennyson's "Charge of the Light Brigade,"
                        and the well-known ballad, "The Lament of the Irish Emigrant," obtained the
                        greater share of the commendation bestowed upon the professedly serious
                        items of the programme. Altogether the entertainment was as agreeable as it
                        was unexceptionable, and can scarcely fail to become very popular in the
                        provinces.
                  
               
               In reference to the "Charge of the Brigade," which, I think, I was the first in
                  1855 to recite in public, and which is now so frequently introduced by various
                  self-styled "professors" of elocution, the "Herald" said: "His recitation of
                  Tennyson's 'Charge of the Light Brigade' threw the audience into a state of
                  enthusiasm."
               The "Note Book" said: "The moving elegy that Tennyson has written upon the brave
                  men who fell in the 'Charge of the Light; Brigade' at Balaklava, he chants, rather
                  than reads, with an enthusiasm, a fire, a fervor, I might say, a frenzy, almost
                  beyond mere histrionic display."
               The "Age" remarked: "The recitation of the 'Charge' was a 'gem' in its way. He has
                  a distinct and correct pronunciation, a
                  judicious regard to what we may call coloring, and appropriate action."
               My modesty prevents my making any more extracts-at any rate, at present-and I
                  accordingly proceed with my adventures in and out of the "diggings."
            
            
               LXXXIV.
               A CHRISTMAS DINNER AT THE FRENCH CONSUL'S.
               I HAD brought from M. Dillon, the French consul at San Francisco, a very pleasant
                  letter to same functionary at Melbourne-the "Count Lionel de Moreton Chabrillan,"
                  whom I found a most delightful, courteous, and hospitable gentleman.
               I was immediately invited to his house at "St. Kilda," distant some two miles from
                  Melbourne-and received a special invitation to dine with him on Christmas Day!
               It may be news to some of my readers in these Northern latitudes to know, that in
                  the Antipodes, this celebrated day occurs in the height of
                  summer!-and therefore, they will not be surprised to hear that I left my
                  hotel in full summer regalia, on a perfect June morning, the thick foliage of the
                  green trees the bright sun, and the wild flowers out in all their glory, being my
                  companions-the only drawback in my pleasant journey being the intolerable dust of
                  the road.
               Arrived at the "Chateau" of the Count, I was very cordially received. The company
                  seated in bamboo chairs under the veranda, overlooking the beautiful gardens of
                  the host.
               In compliment to two or three Englishmen who were present, a splendid sirloin of
                  roast-beef, with pudding to match-Yorkshire and plum-graced the banquet, and when,
                  prior to being seated, the butler handed to each of the gentlemen a nice cool
                  jaunty-looking white jacket-considering it was Christmas Day, I fancied the
                  contrast somewhat singular to the 25th of December of former years.
               "Punkas" were going overhead-the waiters stood behind the chairs, keeping the
                  flies off, with fans in hand; the open windows let in the little air that was
                  stirring, laden with the odors of the summer flowers, and luscious fruit trees!
                  Altogether, this was the most remarkable "Christmas" I had yet passed.
               The walls of the city were covered with large posters of various performers.
               I found that Mrs. C. N. Sinclair and Mr. Henry Sedley were playing a successful
                  engagement-that Madam Anna Bishop was the bright particular star in the musical
                  firmament-that Mr. McKean Buchanan was still the great American tragedian, and
                  that the Miss Gougenheims were the "most fascinating actresses" of the day.
               I shall now jot down from my diary, brief memoranda of which I have before me-such
                  items as may interest the reader during my six months' rambling through the
                  colonies.
               
                  January 29.-My second concert, poured with rain all day-30 in the
                  house-expenses 25-cleared 5-saw on the bills at the Theatre Royal, they play
                  to-night, "All that Glitters isn't Gold."
               Thought of the appositeness of the allusion to my own case.
               Large fire in Great Bourke street-crowd collected on the following day looking
                  with intense astonishment at what was called a "Salamander Safe," which came out
                  of the furnace unscathed.
               A tall raw-boned Yankee was not only "hollering" out the following extraordinary
                  yarn in relation to his "Salamander Safes," of which he was the agent-but had a
                  lot of slips printed, and having it now before me, present it to the reader.
               
                  "SALAMANDER SAFES!"
                  I sold a safe to a big firm in "Saint Louis,"-the house was burnt down with the
                     safe in it-said safe was embedded in
                     the ruins of the fire seven mortal days, exposed to the most intensest heat
                     that was ever felt-a felt from New York wrote out to inquire how it performed,
                     on being removed from the ruins-and the man replied by mail on the following
                     day, that the evening previously to the fire, the head book-keeper had been to
                     the market to purchase a Shanghai cock, and had put it in the safe for safe
                     keeping-intending fully to take it out the next day-on removing it from the
                     fire seven days after he found the COCK FROZEN TO DEATH!
                  The agent managed to sell every safe he had in the colonies.
               
            
            
               LXXXV.
               RAMBLES THROUGH THE COLCNIES.
               WENT to a "levee" at Government House with the Count Chabrillan, Sir Henry
                  Barclay, and Lady Barclay, officiating-some of the scenes very funny-in the
                  scrambling, jolting, and pushing, the ex-asperate-ion, and the
                  dropping of the "H's" were quite prominent, such as, make room 'ere, make room,
                  you're smashing my 'at, get horf my toes, will yer? I carn't get hin, which is the
                  way? Hin 'ere, his that Sir Enry? and the likes.
               
                  January 7.-Start for Geelong, called, I believe, the "second town"
                  in the colony, about forty-five miles from Melbourne-it seemed a place of
                  considerable trade, a large portion of the wool of the colony is from this point
                  shipped.
               The hot winds that obtain here, are most disagreeable; I was treated to several
                  "puffs" Upon my arrival, as I was wending my way to the newspaper offices; the
                  dust and heat intolerable.
               Met Mr. Henry Coleman, who was giving his clever entertainment at the theatre
                  called "Masks and Faces"-engaged the "Town-hall" for Monday night, paid therefor
                  10.
               The night having duly arrived, the rain as usual came down in torrents, the
                  entertainment went off well, excepting the unpleasant reverberation of sound owing
                  to the faulty architecture of the hall, and the "sparseness" of the audience-the
                  "Advertiser" on the following day came out in a very complimentary article,
                  stating that the audience was very select (very) including "his worship" the
                  Mayor, many of the merchants, bankers, and professional men of the town.
               The effect was very funny, in my recitation of the "Song of a Shirt."
               It was something like this: 
                     
                        With fingers weary and worn-(echo)
                        worn.
                     
                     
                        With eyelids heavy and red
                        red.
                     
                     
                        A woman sat in unwomanly rags
                        gags.
                     
                     
                        Plying her needle and thread
                        dead.
                     
                     
                        Stitch, stitch, stitch
                        ditch.
                     
                     
                        In poverty, hunger, and dirt
                        hurt.
                     
                     
                        And still with a voice of dolorous pitch
                        stitch.
                     
                     
                        She sang the Song of a Shirt
                        dirt!
                     
                  
               
               And so on.
               As I am going occasionally to initiate my readers into some of the mysteries of my
                  individual professional doings, not only for their amusement and information, but
                  for my own gratification, I shall commence by stating that my expenses here were
                  about 20, and my receipts exactly 11.
               The reader will therefore perceive that I was about 9 out of pocket-so I thought
                  I'd ge-long somewhere else!-Accordingly, the next day I started for
                  Ballarat, which is, I believe, the largest mining locality in the colonies.
               I left Geelong by the morning coach at five o'clock, reaching Ballarat about four
                  in the afternoon.
               The style of vehicle in which I took my seat, and which is, with one exception,
                  invariably used to convey passengers by land in Australia, is what they call the
                  "American Concord Coach."
               This line was established by Mr. Cobb of Boston, in 1853, is now owned by
                  Americans, and the ribbons are always in the hands of Yankee drivers. The roads
                  were execrable, in winter almost impassable owing to the heavy rains; and intolerable in the summer from the
                  frightful amount of heat, dust, and hot winds, the latter peculiarly indigenous to
                  this country.
               Jolted to, pieces, fagged out, dusty and dirty, I arrived at my destination.
               My countenance was just the reverse of that of this pleasant-looking gentleman,
                  who was described on p. 272, but who is put in here by way of contrast to the
                  picture the reader may have formed of me.
               
                   
               
               The town appeared to me to be composed of one street, about three miles in length,
                  flanked on either side and as far as the eye could reach by an immense extent of
                  country covered with innumerable tents, their white tops glittering in the
                  sun-light, presenting a vast panorama, looking more like a large battle-field than
                  a mining region-for to give the reader an idea of the magnitude of the diggings
                  here, I will first mention that the population in: and about Ballarat is estimated
                  at over 100,000 souls!
               The ground over which our Jebu was galloping, at the rate of twelve miles an hour,
                  seemed composed of a white chalky substance, some two or three inches thick, the
                  team and wind together raising such a dust, as would every now and then envelop us
                  in a thick fog.
               On either side of the street were one story frame-houses, tents, etc., while
                  further in the town were several large shops, and a few buildings of brick and
                  stone.
               They publish here three daily newspapers; hotels (such as they are) are very
                  abundant. They have, I believe, one church and three theatres, rejoicing in the
                  names of the Montezuma, Charley Napier, and Victoria.
               Large transparencies were suspended from the front windows of each: One announcing
                  that the "Great American Tragedian. Mr. McKean Buchanan, would that night appear
                  in his celebrated character of Hamlet;" the other, that the world-renowned Pablo
                  Fauque would perform his daring feats upon the tight-rope; and the other, that the
                  most perfect and faultless representation of the play of the Lady of Lyons would
                  that night be given. The Claude by a pupil of Mr. Charles Kean, and the Pauline by
                  a relation of Mrs. Siddons.
               I could not resist the temptation of visiting the last-mentioned place, and upon
                  the application of any of my readers to me personally will give them an imitation,
                  finding it impossible to do so on paper!
               On the next day I was engaged by a man to go to a little place called Creswick
                  Creek, he offering me 10 and my expenses.
               I acquiesced; and, after he had paid me the money, got the bills and posters out,
                  it immediately commenced to rain.
               Arrived at Creswick Creek-went to the hotel, made of canvas, with a theatre
                  complete inside of it.
               I forgot to inform the reader that my melodeon accompanied me to Australia,
                  thinking not only that it would be convenient in the "diggings," where pianos were
                  difficult to get, but that I might sell it at an advance.
               The "box of music" I carried to Creswick.
               The house was about half full-the rain and cold intense-the roof leaking in all
                  directions, and the gloom and desolation, not only of the surroundings, but
                  depicted on the countenances of my auditory, were something fearful to
                  contemplate; and when in answer to a very civilly put question to my landlord (who
                  had engaged me as a great Card) as to whether it was best to begin, he replied, in
                  a very unpleasant manner "Oh the should I know," it not calculated to put me into
                  a very good humor.
               
               From my bed-room to the theatre it was a pool of water, and I had to roll up my
                  trowsers to prevent them getting wet.
               The melodeon was placed in the centre of the stage, which was quite damp and
                  unpleasant.
               I had got as far as the reading of the "Song of the Shirt," about the third thing
                  on the bill, when I found three of my audience asleep and half of them with
                  umbrellas up. About this time I felt, as I stood there reading and trying to keep
                  my face straight, the rain coming down drop, drop, drop, on the end of my nose. I
                  moved further up the stage; still I felt it on the top of my head. I then,
                  apologizing to my audience, asked their kind permission to get under cover, and
                  finished the reading holding in one hand a large Chinese umbrella!
               I was not invited to repeat the performance at Creswick Creek.
               Returning to Ballarat, put up at Golden Fleece hotel; the weather intensely cold,
                  though in the middle of summer.
               On 23d of January, start for Maryboro, a mining town of considerable
                  importance.
               Maryboro a city of "tents"-heat intense (no joke meant)-dust and fleas perfectly
                  fearful.
               Put up at the Golden Hotel.
               The theatre, as usual, in the big room of the hotel-cotton walls-hard
                  benches-stifling heat, and delighted audiences.
               Paid 2 for 100 small posters. Receipts about 10; expenses 20; profits
                  in proportion.
               January 28, at Dunolly, another "mining" locality; stopped at the GOLDEN AGE
                  HOTEL, inside of which was the Royal Victoria Theatre.
               The poster which announced to the distinguished citizens that a "Grand Ballad
                  Concert and Headings" was to be given at the above establishment, looked more like
                  a Day & Martin's blacking placard than anything else, and my audience
                  resembled more a gathering of persons to witness an execution, than one to be
                  delighted by any elocutionary or vocal effort.
               The night before the concert, a funny incident occurred curred to me at the hotel,
                  which I shall try briefly to describe.
               But first it will be necessary, for the reader more fully to appreciate the joke,
                  to be informed that, for the last eighteen years of my life, bathing in cold water
                  has been with me a daily habit. Now when I say "bathing," I mean that my body,
                  from head to foot, is immersed in cold water; and it is as much a necessity with
                  me as eating and drinking.
               I intend prefacing this little anecdote with a few words upon the subject of
                  bathing.
               From a young medical friend of mine, I have ascertained the fact that the pores of
                  the skin, by which the perspiration escapes, or ought to escape, are so numerous
                  that a grain of sand, placed oh any part of the skin, covers upwards of one
                     hundred thousand of these fine apertures. The effect on the system when
                  these are clogged up by neglect of ablution, may easily be imagined.
               The devotion of a few minutes only to either immersing m the body in cold water,
                  or resorting to the more easy application of the sponge, is well repaid by the
                  healthy glow and general lightness of the system throughout the ensuing day; and
                  when it is added, that no medicine hitherto discovered confers good health and
                  long life with so much certainty as uniform bathing and regular exercise, surely,
                  those who do not comply with these easy conditions have no right to complain of
                  being deprived of such inestimable blessings.
               Those who cannot procure the luxury of a regular bath, may, at all events, procure
                  a large earthenware-pan, which will prove always serviceable as a foot bath. This
                  should be filled with fresh water every morning, and after rising the bather
                  should saturate a towel in the cold fluid, place it round the head, so as to
                  prevent any reaction upwards, and stand, if the ablutor cannot sit, in the pan
                  itself. With a sponge the bather may now, after removing the wet towel, enjoy a
                  "shower-bath" in miniature, alternately soaking the sponge and squeezing it above
                  the head for several minutes.
               The body may be afterwards sponged all over, and then rubbed entirely dry with
                  coarse towelling.
               Horsehair gloves and belts, to promote activity by rapid friction, may be used with considerable
                  advantage, and the bather should then dress as speedily as possible.
               This plan should be pursued summer and winter-every morning-through
                     every change of the seasons-and whatever may be the temperature,
                  the bather may almost defy "colds," "sore throats," and "influenza," throughout
                  the year.
               So much for "bathing," now for my anecdote.
               I had managed-by dint of giving halfa-crown to "Biddy" the chambermaid-to secure a
                  bucket of water for my morning's sousing, and had retired for the night closing
                  the door of my primitive apartment with a latch made of leather, and watching with
                  great attention the doings of a couple of rats, one of which was nibbling at some
                  grass that was growing underneath my wooden cot, and the other in the act of
                  carrying off one of my socks. A tap came to the door, and "Biddy" appeared with a
                  big iron pot full of water, stating that there were no pails, Buckets, or tubs in
                  the house, and that this was he only "thing" she could lay her hands on.
               In the morning I was awakened at an early hour by a loud knocking at the door, and
                  by any number of voices, singing out for "Biddy," "Biddy."
               I listened, and heard a man's voice call out "the Iron pot's gone," "Biddy, some
                  one's stole the potato pot."
               "Lor'a mercy," cried Biddy, "I gave it the gentleman in No. 18 to wash in"-rand
                  with that piece of information, I jumped out of bed and ducked my head in the pot,
                  and sponging myself to nor heart's content, regardless of the streams of water
                  that completely covered the floor, and the screams of an old covey in the room
                  underneath me, upon whose bald head the water was rushing with "Niagara"
                  swiftness.
               Knock-knock-knock at the door. "If you please, sir, Biddy has given you the pot in
                  mistake, and we've got nothing to boil the potatoes in, sir, for breakfast!"
               But the row in the old gentleman's room beggars description.
               Now the reader must understand, that the floor was only an inch thick, and full of
                  gaping seams and holes, and my temporary bathing-potato-pot-tub must have been
                  immediately diately over his head-for with my plunge he sprang up, hollering at
                  the top of his voice,
               "Murder, thieves, fire, water, police!" while the pool I made by my sudden dive,
                  not only wet everything in the room, but nearly drowned the old gentleman.
               The man came in and got his potato pot-the old gentleman dried himself-all the
                  boarders enjoyed the joke, if they didn't the potatoes, and I the pot-pour-i, although the old cock it is supposed put a toe down against such
                  practices.
               At Dunolly, I met some very jolly and gentlemanly fellows; among those who were
                  particularly civil, hospitable, and attentive, were Captain Virginius Murray, Mr.
                  Farquhar, and Dr. Cordellis, whom I met at the house of Mr. John Kerr, whither I
                  had taken shelter, during a tremendous hail and rain storm-the hail bigger than a
                  pigeon's egg, and I having to find my way home to the "Golden Age Hotel" by the
                  aid of a lantern.
               Fortunately I did not then wear the large hat which, according to the old lady on
                  page 185, is distinctive of Americans, or I should have been either unroofed or
                  carried away.
               
                   
               
            
            
               
               LXXXVI.
               HOW I GOT TO MY HOTEL.
               Now I had in California seen some pretty bad and impassable roads-and
                  streets-streets knee deep in mud, slush, and filth, but the midnight walk, aided
                  very feebly by a shocking bad and rickety lantern, from the headquarters of
                  Captain Virginius Murray to the palatial residence of the subscriber, baffles
                  description.
               There were (of course) no lamp-posts, no sidewalks, no roads, no lights,
                  (excepting now and then the indistinct flickering of a farthing rushlight from the
                  tent of an "honest miner")-no anything-all gloom, darkness, rain, and mud.
               I was told to "keep to the right," "go straight ahead," and I should soon find the
                  Hotel-and how soon I found the Hotel, the reader shall presently be informed.
               I think I had proceeded about a hundred yards from the "Headquarters" of Captain
                  V. M--, the wind and rain beating in my face, and making several ineffectual
                  attempts to "put out the light" by rattling up against the horned window of my
                  little lantern; my legs encased in a pair of "top boots" that reached to my
                  middle, and would have been considered by Mr. "Vanderdecker" in the "Flying
                  Dutchman," a first rate "property"-had become already quite used to disappearing
                  every now and then in a large mud-hole, and I with the greatest difficulty had
                  managed to trope my way thus far, by the aid of my dim candle, that kept giving
                  unmistakable signs of sputtering out, like the speech of a drunken politician, and
                  ending in total darkness, which such oratory usually produces; when suddenly I had
                  a sensation such as I presume would be produced by the combined action of an
                  earthquake and a Volcanic eruption, and when my senses gained something like their
                  natural condition, I found myself reduced to a somewhat globular form; having
                  totally disappeared from the surface of this earth, my faithless light being
                  extinguished in my lantern, as effectually as I was extinguished from society, and
                  the view (not very distinct either) of the surrounding country generally.
               After picking myself up, shaking myself, and wiping the mud from my eyes, and
                  looking in vain for help or succor, I think I stood still for several minutes, to
                  "take stock." To return was impossible-to proceed was about as bad, and to remain
                  motionless was very uncomfortable.
               We have all read of "total darkness," but I think it was never before
                  by me, at least, so fully appreciated; but on I went-whither I knew not-and
                  feeling at every step the moral certainty of my again disappearing entirely from
                  the naked eye at any moment-nor did I long remain in doubt-tor first slightly
                  relieving the monotony of my former gymnastycal feat, by bumping up
                  against the stump of a big tree, the concussion being so great, I was pitched
                  "neck and crop" into a pool of water, my favorite element, and presenting by this
                  time an hydraulic phenomenon rarely witnessed in that or any other country.
               How I got out I know not-where I was I could not then, nor have I ever since
                  ascertained-and my arriving at my Hotel has always remained a mystery to me.
               It, however, taught me a lesson and that was never again to trust myself out after
                  dark in an "undiscovered country" visiting the "headquarters" of anybody, at the
                  risk of not only deluging my "hind-quarters," but of subjecting me to a practical
                  illustration of the poet's simile about the traveller never returning from
                     that bourne!

               ON THE WING.
               MY visit to the diggings, and indeed through the colonies generally, was of such
                  an ephemeral and will-o'-the-wisp character as to preclude, the possibly, even if
                  I had the intention, of entering more into detail than I have done, in reference
                  to localities or individual occurrences. I shall endeavor to jot down, as they
                  flash upon my memory, a few of the most
                  prominent incidents of adventure, and some exciting scenes, slightly assisted by
                  very meagre and desultory notes and memoranda, which, with the reader's
                  permission, I will transcribe from a book of items made at the time.
               
                  January 28.-Last Concert at Dunolly-pouring rain-crowded house-heat
                  fearful-gentlemen of the camp wished a repetition-the "Charge of the Brigade"
                  created the greatest excitement. Paid 2 for the use of a piano with only two legs,
                  no pedal, and missing keys. Rain again coming on the audience and the
                  performer.
               
                  February 2.-Went in a dog cart (so called) to Bendigo, a celebrated
                  mining locality. Put up at the Shamrock Hotel. The city(?) reminding me greatly of
                  similar localities in California, with this exception-that throughout Australia I
                  have noticed a much greater regard evinced for durability in the erection and
                  structure of their public and private buildings; their motto evidently being, "Not
                  for a day, but for all time."
               Public entertainments here were in a very rude condition about this time; the
                  principal and decidedly most popular being the Drinking and Concert
                  Saloons.
               I shall endeavor to give a brief description of what I saw at one of them.
            
            
               LXXXVIII.
               CONCERT SALOONS.
               THE Concert Hall of the Shamrock Hotel, then, was about 75 feet long by 50 wide.
                  At the end was a stage, or raised platform, for the performer, upon which was one
                  of Erard's grand pianos; the floor was covered with wooden benches, with troughs
                  in front, upon which to place the pot of ale or "harf and harf" of the occupier of
                  the seat.
               There was no pay exacted for entrance; the proprietor depending for his. profits
                  upon the amount of liquor and cigars consumed by the audience.
               The receipts were immense, as were also the salaries paid to the performers. For
                  instance, the conductor, Mr. Lavenu, one of the most talented composers of the
                  day, received 30, or $150 a week, while the leading lady vocalist got 50.
               The scene, when the hall was full, was intensely amusing and disgusting. The
                  jingling of glasses and clattering of pots, the dense clouds of smoke from the
                  fumes of tobacco and cigars, and not of the choicest brands at that, mixed with
                  some of the richest colonial Billingsgate that ever came from the mouth of a
                  costermonger, rendered this resort particularly attractive to the refined, the
                  philosophical, or intellectual listener.
               But with the exception of the Theatre, open only now and then, there was no other
                  place of amusement, no other method of passing away an evening.
               The receipts were frequently 200 and 00 a night; and the consequence was, the
                  proprietors (two Irishmen) were making, when I left, a rapid fortune.
            
            
               LXXXIX.
               MY CONCERT IN BENDIGO.
               THE Criterion was the name of the theatre at which I opened at the above place,
                  and for which they charged me 20 rent per night-rayther steep, I
                  thought, for a quiet individual's performance.
               The town was billed and progammed and to any extent, and posters black and blue
                  and (supposed to be) re(a)d all over covered the walls of the city and adjacent
                  township.
               The heat was very great, almost suffocating; and the clouds threatened rain; added
                  to which, it was the night of me the first appearance of a celebrity in the female
                  singing line at one of the saloons; and I did not feel particularly brilliant
                  about the result of my "show."
               The theatre had been originally built, at a cost of $30,000, by American, named
                  Mr. Hentry Clarkson, of whom I have to speak hereafter, and had been opened by
                  Madame Lola Montez, and where she played a series of brilliant engagements gagements; but the Building was out of
                  the way, and had proved, both to owner and stockholders, a sorry speculation.
               The scenery and stage appointments were fast running to decay, as were also
                  numbers of rats, who swarmed the building upon my entrance, early in the evening,
                  to see if the room scene was set, the piano there, and the reading desk in its
                  proper place.
               The scene-shifter and the carpenter had been taking their evening meal on the
                  stage aforesaid, and the remains, consisting of some choice scraps of red herring
                  and bread and cheese, were being devoured by some of the largest black rats I had
                  ever seen.
               Upon my approach they skedaddled, and I took my coat off, then a seat, to try and
                  get cool; for the perspiration was pouring from me in streams, and I was wondering
                  how I should possibly get through the fatigues of the evening.
               A wonderful place for reflection is the inside of a theatre in the daytime; and
                  for a few moments I gave the rein to my fancy, and "let fall the windows of my
                  eyes' in sleep.
               It is all very fine to talk about the "annihilation of space," as seen in the
                  operations of the telegraph or the locomotive; but they shrink into
                  insignificance, when compared with the speed of a run in Dreamland!
               Whew! In less than five minutes I was sitting in the Old Park Pit of New York,
                  listening to the strains of the opera of the Bohemian Girl,-while the poet Milton
                  (such funny things occur in dreams) was to play Tom Tug in the Waterman.
               Milton had just been encored in the "Bay of Biscay," when I was immediately
                  transferred to a private box at Drury Lane, where Ned Davenport was playing
                  William in Black Eyed Susan to T. P. Cooke's Hamlet.
               I was just about going behind the scenes, to shake my friend Ned by the hands, and
                  to inquire the cause of the strange amalgamation, at the same time congratulating
                  him upon his success in introducing, for the first time, a sailor's hornpipe in
                  the graveyard and the ghost scene-when-oh horror! I saw, underlined on the big
                  poster, in front of Drury Lane, that I was announced to play Richard the Third, to
                  Charlotte Cushman's Mrs. Haller, at the Honolulu Theatre, Sandwich Islands, on the
                  following night.

               I had just packed up my trunk, and arrived at a hotel, situated on the back of a
                  large whale, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, when I was informed by the stage
                  manager, Captain Cook, that the Rev. Mr. Spurgeon would preach in Park Lane Chapel
                  every Sunday, until further notice, morning and evening; and that if I would
                  adjourn to his house he would regale me with a nice slice from the cold shoulder
                  of a departed missionary!
               I was wondering whether the delicate morsel was roasted or boiled, when I was
                  aroused from my reverie by a shaking of the arm, and seeming to fall from the top
                  of a six-story house to the street, without hurting myself-a feat never failing to
                  be accomplished with great success in sleep-I found myself, with the house
                  half-filled with people, sitting in the middle of the stage, and expected to
                  commence my performance.
               There was no "backing out" now; and making my way off as quickly as possible, I
                  inquired the reason of the man's not waking me before.
               Seeing the fellow turn his back upon me, and walk away, I questioned him again,
                  and angrily asked him why he had not fixed the stage earlier? he made no reply;
                  but another man began talking with his fingers, and motioning me to come along
                  with him. I now began to think that my assistants were either drunk or mad; and in
                  my despair-for there was no time to be lost-I ran to my hotel, made a hasty
                  toilet, and in a perfect vapor bath of perspiration returned to the theatre to go
                  through a very heavy programme.
               It was on such occasions as these that I felt the weight that rested on my
                  shoulders; when entirely alone, and single-handed, I was expected to amuse an
                  audience of strangers for two hours: to be serious and funny, to imitate the
                  cracked voice of an old woman, sing a ballad decently, change my voice at least a
                  dozen times, and screw my face up into every imaginable shape, when I felt
                  perfectly wretched, and more like bursting out a-crying than anything else.
               Upon this night, what would I not have given for the look of a well-remembered
                  face, for the touch of a friendly hand?
               
               I think I never felt so desolate, or so disinclined to go through with my motley
                  programme.
               Now for the fun!
               I called to the man to "ring up."
               He replied, by running away to the opposite side of the stage, and returning with
                  a dirty scrap of paper in his hand, upon which was written: 
                     
                        "I'm deaf and dumb,
                        "And t'other man's gone home!"
                     
                  
               
               Now I don't pretend to say I'm a model of either patience or endurance, or that I
                  am very nervous; but at this particular moment of time, if I had spoken at all, I
                  think I should certainly have exploded-burst, with indignation, rage, and
                  fury.
               The uselessness of it at once flashed upon me, and I endeavored to be
                  calm. The poor fellow couldn't help being deaf and dumb, though certainly I
                  deserved better treatment from the theatre folks, and I proceeded at once to do my
                  best.
               Writing, then, "ring up" on the wall, with a piece of chalk, I walked
                  on, commencing my first song.
               My audience was not particularly enthusiastic, though I think I succeeded in
                  getting one or two faint laughs, at the scene from the "Lady of Lyons," and the
                  imitation of Madame Anna Bishop; and the delight I felt when I found I had arrived
                  at the "ten minutes intermission" period, can be easily imagined.
               I signed to my deaf and dumb man to ring down the curtain. This done,
                  I wrote hastily on a piece of paper:
               "Go to my room and get a shirt, you'll find it on the bed."
               I have told the reader that the heat upon this occasion was something fearful; for
                  never before or since, not even in India, have I been so perfectly prostrated as I
                  was upon this night.
               The time was short, the audience impatient, and already had commenced clapping,
                  thumping, and "hi hi"ing for the unfortunate performer; I, stripped to my
                  smallclothes, anxiously awaiting the cooling and refreshing change of linen, when,
                  to my disgust and horror, the man appeared with a birch broom and a
                     sheet-(having translated my harried scrawl of room for
                  broom, and shirt for sheet!)
               What I said I know not; to blow the man up was useless, for he couldn't hear; but
                  I think I must have looked like a madman; for upon seizing hold of the sheet and
                  broom, and throwing them from me, they went right through a forest of trees and a
                  church steeple, and the man after them, leaving me all alone in my glory.
               The first part of my programme was over, thank Heaven; and when the readers are
                  informed that I had sung four ballads, given a comic scene of a Pauline and Claude
                  in the Lady of Lyons, an imitation of Anna Bishop, a lengthy reading from
                  Blackwood, the "Charge of the Light Brigade," a comic adventure in Sacramento, and
                  read an autograph letter of Queen Victoria, they will sympathize with me in my
                  affliction.
               My ten minutes were up, and having managed to "hoist the rag" myself, on I went,
                  and strange to say, my first recitation was 
                     "The Song of a Shirt."
                   Now, if any one in the audience had the slightest idea of what had been going
                  on behind the scenes, I should have been ruined; as it was, I proceeded with great
                  difficulty, for not only had every vestige of my own piece of linen disappeared
                  long since, but the incident itself, and any consciousness of the peculiar picture
                  I presented to the audience, made it hard for me to keep a "straight face."
               The second part over, and I was congratulating myself upon my speedy departure,
                  and had just commenced my description of a "Yankee Town Meeting," with an
                  imitation of Mr. Nathan Grunt, a grouty old chairman, when the lights of the
                  entire establishment went out-a general scream arose from the audience-while I, in
                  feeling my way off the stage, fell through a trap door upon a lot of
                     shavings, a barberous scrape, that I never dreamed of
                  getting into.
               From Bendigo I went to Eagle Hawk, and at the Camp Hotel gave a Reading; about a
                  hundred people present; tickets 5s.
               
               My stage was the dining-room table. I had no piano, and was assisted by a young gentleman who
                  volunteered to accompany me upon an accordeon; the effect was not very delightful,
                  either upon the audience or myself, and the consequence was, that the ballads were
                  disposed of as quickly as possible, as was also the entertainment. Receipts and
                  profits limited.
               
                   
               
               From Eagle Hawk to Castlemaine, another mining town, was engaged for 20, at the
                  Assembly Boom, to sing two songs, and give the Charge of the Light Brigade. This
                  style of thing pays. Thence to a charming little spot called Taradale, where I was
                  delighted to meet a Mr. and Mrs. Sir, whom I had seen frequently at the French
                  Consul's, in Melbourne. I was greeted most cordially, and at the little church on
                     Quinquagesima Sunday, February 22, heard a most delightful sermon
                  preached by the Rev. Mr. Martin, whom I had met in New York fifteen years
                  previously.
               Here also I met Mr. Hoskins, and Miss Julia Harland, both known in New York.
               Kyneton was the next place, where, in the Church of England School Room, I held
                  forth.
               The room crowded; receipts over 30.
               Once again in Melbourne, at my old quarters at the Mechanics' Institute, where,
                  under the immediate patronage of His Excellency Sir Henry Barkly, Lady Barkly, and
                  Major-General Macarthur, I gave a Farewell Concert, in which, by
                  particular desire, I introduced, for the first time in Victoria, the exciting poem
                  of the Young Gray-head.
               By my Memorandum Book I find that on the 3d March I went to the Philharmonic
                  Concert, after a good dinner with George Loder, where Madame Anna Bishop sang, and
                  "Miska Hawsa" (any relation to Caspar?) played the violin.
               4th. Passed a delightful evening with Mr. James Smith (once of Salisbury), of the
                  "Argus."
               And here, at this remote distance, should these desultory pages ever reach him,
                  let me thank him, as well as the Press generally, throughout the Colonies, for the
                  very great kindness and generous attentions received at their hands.
               23d March. Left for Adelaide, South Australia, in steamship "White Swan."
               On the 4th day arrived at the Port, and by rail to the city, and put up at a very
                  cozy hotel, kept by a good fellow on the Square, named J. R.
                  Jones.
               Took White's Assembly Booms, and gave my first Concert on Tuesday evening, March
                  31, 1857.
               Receipts over 40, and the rain came down in torrents at that!
               Adelaide is decidedly a handsome city, and has more the appearance of a quiet,
                  well organized, regularly built English town than any that I had yet visited. The
                  Government House, where Sir Henry and Lady Macdonald reign supreme, is a very
                  imposing looking edifice, situated in the centre of magnificent grounds,
                  tastefully and elegantly laid out.
               The city boasts also of several very handsome churches, numbers of places of
                  worship of various denominations, two theatres, besides several very stylish
                  public buildings.
               The harbors of South Australia are equally good with those of the adjoining
                  colonies.
               They are chiefly comprised within the large bays called Spencer's Gulf and Gulf
                  St. Vincent.
               Port Adelaide, where I landed, is an inlet from the latter, and is situated about
                  seven miles from the city.
               Near this is the roadstead, called Holdfast Bay the anchorage of which, I am informed, is excellent,
                  but the winds blow here sometimes fearfully.
               I must not forget to mention the kindness and hospitalities received from many in
                  Adelaide, particularly from Dr. Taylor and his interesting family, who, during my
                  sojourn, extended to me the most generous welcome; so much so, that I felt the
                  greatest disinclination to say "good-by."
               After giving four entertainments in Adelaide, and one at Pier Hotel, Glenelg, I
                  started in the steamer Burra Burra, Captain Harper, once more for Melbourne.
               On 11th May left for Sydney, New South Wales, in the Governor General, Captain
                  Cottier.
               On 13th, passed the spot where the California steamer, Monumental City, was lost,
                  on board of which was my old friend Pete Strobel, of San Francisco. The place is
                  called Tallaborga Island.
            
            
               XC.
               SYDNEY.
               15th.-About dark arrived in Sydney, and on the following day
                  received a visit from my old friend Col. Laurence, of whom I have before written
                  in my "Pickersgill Reminiscences" in 1840.
               Sydney is the capital of the Australian colonies, and is the largest as well as
                  the most ancient city in the colonies; and the harbor, one of the handsomest in
                  the world. I believe the place contains about 100,000 inhabitants.
               On reaching the city from what is called the "Heads" it has a very imposing
                  appearance. The large amount of shipping, the bright green verdure of the
                  surrounding country, the terraced garden walks, the city stretching along the
                  shore and on the heights in the most magnificent manner; the lower portion thereof
                  fairly teeming with the adjuncts of commerce, the central part completely studded
                  with churches, cathedrals, and magnificent public buildings, while the heights of
                  the neighboring township, called Woollomolloo-what a name!-are crowned with the
                  elegant gant villas and suburban retreats of the elite of Sydney society, The
                  scene is one of remarkable beauty, not only from the picturesque appearance of the
                  beautiful islands and inlets, the shores of which seem covered with a vegetation
                  ever verdant, but the general effect upon the "looker-on" is most exhilarating,
                  from the bustle, activity, and beauty that perpetually greet the eye.
               It was difficult to me upon landing to believe I was really at the antipodes!
               Everything was so thoroughly English.
               Streets large, well paved, the bright jets of gas lighting up most brilliantly the
                  shops of the a "haberdasher" and "jeweller," whose wares astonished and dazzled
                  the eye of the beholder, and presented as many prismatic colors to the vision as
                  did ever Irvington's on Ludgate Hill, or Storr & Mortimer in Bond street.
                  'Buses passed and repassed, while "cads," with finger up, solicited a fare at
                  sixpence a head, and "Hansoms" darted by you with meteor-like rapidity.
               Piemen called out "baked taters, all 'ot," while the bright tin cans, with the
                  little chimney of steam, looked as inviting to the hungry pedestrian as in
                  Shoreditch or the Minories; piemen, too, with little white aprons, vended their
                  "mutton" and "kidneys" "vith" or "vithout" gravy; while from a baker's window I
                  read the well remembered words: "Muffins and crumpets every evening at six." It
                  seemed that at every step something occurred to remind me of old England, roast
                  beef "and things."
               The market, a superb affair in George street, seemed as richly stocked as the
                  Fulton or Washington in New York, or the Honey Lane in London; while if you wish a
                  delightful stroll through well gravelled walks, verdant swards, beds of delicious
                  flowers, go to the Botanical Gardens, where the floral treasures of the tropics
                  flourish in the most entrancing luxuriousness, and breathe their fragrance in an
                  atmosphere as balmy as in the islands of the Pacific I had so recently
                  visited.
               It seemed to me that in this superb spot all and every kind of tropical and
                  semi-tropical rarity had been transplanted-brought from all parts of the
                     globe-South American and Indian
                  exotics growing here in the greatest luxuriance.
               The gardens are laid out in the most attractive manner possible; shady walks, long
                  grassy terraces, cozy seats and lounging places, hewn out of solid rock,
                  overshadowed by native figs and other trees of the thickest foliage.
               Fountains, with every variety of jet, spurted forth their refreshing streams and
                  sparkled in the bright sunlight, cooling the air, delighting the eye, and making
                  the little gold and silver fish skip and jump about in the pond beneath.
               Then here you have a Hyde Park, where you may see the "wealthy," if not the
                  "noble," taking their drive regularly and with singular importance, and on this
                  point it struck me it was difficult to tell "who's who!"
               That gaudy and flashy equipage, with the liveried and powdered coachman and
                  footman, with the armorial bearings tawdrily painted on either side, that has just
                  dashed by you, bespattering you with mud or covering you with dust, contains,
                  perhaps, the distinguished carcase of a man vulgarly called an old "lag," who may
                  have left his native land for either having indulged in the pleasant pastime of
                  "sheep-stealing," or the more desperate one of "murder." He has not only "served
                  out" but improved his time; a new generation has sprung up; and though he
                     can never return to England-mind that!-he feels now as "good as the next
                  man," and perhaps even exchanges words with his "Excellency the Governor."
               I was told that the word "Convict" must never be mentioned in Sidney, as it was
                  difficult to say whose corns might be trod upon.
               
               This appeared to be the only disagreeable element in the society of this place-I
                  felt nervous and unpleasant in my daily intercourse with the people, having
                  perpetually the sensation of confronting the once upon a time occupant of a cell
                  in the Old Bailey, or a similar resting-place at the Hotel d' Horsemonger
                  Lane.
               The Jews are not merely a very wealthy but highly influential class here, and the
                  entre to the "upper circles" of the Israelitish population will not only be found
                  most delightful to the stranger, but if they happen to take a fancy to you,
                  pecuniarily advantageous, upon either "benefit" night-or a "first" or "last"
                  appearance.
               Probably no artiste was more petted, or left Sidney with mightier proofs of the
                  munificence of this liberal class of citizens than did Madame Anna Bishop.
               And now for my opening night in the Capital.
               I had taken up my residence at "Osmond's" in Pitt street, and with the assistance
                  and friendly aid of my young friend "Ed," son of Col. L--, had taken the "MECHANICS' SCHOOL OF ARTS" for my opening night.
               "Freyers" printing office in George street had issued immense "Posters" in the
                  biggest kind of type, announcing the fact, and the Bill-stickers had faithfully
                  stuck 'em up "all over the City," while I, with my treasurer, jumped in a
                     carriage-(for it was raining in torrents!-as usual-) to convey me
                  to the Hall in Pitt street.
               My audience seemed delighted, the Hall was well filled, containing in money about
                  thirty-six pounds, and everything went off well-the "Charge of the Light Brigade"
                  as usual, carrying off the honors. The press the next day, without any exception,
                  was, most laudatory.
               
                  June 3.-Went to-day to the "Newtown Cemetery," a most beautiful spot
                  for the burial of the dead, and something in the style of "Greenwood."
               Conspicuous among the more attractive of the tombs is a very elegant monument
                  erected to the renowned Harpist Bochsa, who died in this city two weeks after his
                  arrival. Here is the Inscription:- 
                     SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF
                        NICHOLAS CHARLES BOCHSA, ESQ., who died 6th JANUARY,
                        1856. AGED 65. This monument is erected in sincere devotedness by
                        his faithful friend and pupil,
                     
                        ANNA BISHOP.
                        "Mourn him, mourn his harp-strings broken,
                        Never more shall float such music;
                        None could sweep the lyre like him!"
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               XCI.
               A VISIT TO THE LUNATIC ASYLUM AT PARAMATTA.
               LYING on my table, as I am writing this sketch, is a piece of dark brown paper,
                  containing three little pieces of white linen, upon one of which is worked in
                  green silk the words: "Forget me not" and upon each of the others, in the same
                  material a "Chalice;" there is also a piece of worsted of varied colors, in the
                  form of a tippet or collar. Upon the inside of this piece of paper are the words: 
                     "From Miss Brady to Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg, England. Europe."
                  
               
               Upon the outside, I wrote at the same time the following:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           Given to me by Miss Brady a lunatic, with the permission of Mrs.
                              Statham, the Matron of the Paramatta Insane Asylum.
                           
                              Thursday, June 11, 1857.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               The scene, which will never be forgotten by me, I shall now attempt briefly to
                  describe.
               I had been invited by one of the Wardens of the Institution to visit it, and
                  accordingly devoted an entire day to the purpose.
               The Asylum itself is a magnificent structure of granite, several stories in
                  height, containing a very large number of wards for patients, male and female,
                  court yards of large dimensions, and grounds tastefully laid, out; order and
                  cleanliness here reign supreme, and the regulations and rules are strict, and
                  rigidly enforced.
               Upon my entrance into the Department for females, I was at first struck by the
                  beauty of a lady seated at a desk, whom I at first took for one of the assistants,
                  or perhaps the Matron.

               I was proceeding through the room to a beautiful little garden spot just beyond,
                  when she approached me, and laying her hand quite gently on my arm, said: "Oh!
                  Sir; I trust I may be pardoned-but you are about returning to Europe, are you
                  not?"
               I was taken sorely by surprise, and at the same time completely dazzled by her
                  beauty, that for the moment I was off my guard, and hesitated; when Mrs. Stratham
                  the Matron ran to me, and quietly whispering in my ear, hurriedly said-"Humor
                  her-it's a severe case-she's perfectly harmless-and her conversation will interest
                  you."
               In brief, she was a highly educated, young Irish lady, who from reverses had to
                  take a situation as governess in a wealthy family in Sydney; for years-even since
                  childhood-she had been in love with Prince Albert-and the feeling had taken so
                  strong a hold upon her nature, that she had been for a long time a confirmed
                  lunatic.
               Asking me if I would walk with her a few steps, she said, taking from her pocket,
                  and handing me a little package:
               "Will you do me the greatest favor, upon your return to England, to go to Windsor
                  Castle, and give this packet to Prince Albert?"
               "With pleasure," I replied. "Oh! sir, if you knew how in the long cold nights of
                  winter I have sat in my lonely cell, thinking of him-and knitting and working till
                  my fingers bled again-at this little worsted collar for his dear neck!" and then
                  she would kiss it, and press it to her lips-"and these," said she-"are the copies
                  of the 'Chalice' used by me at the Holy Sacrament-tell him I pray for him night
                  and day-and that I know we shall meet again and be happy." I asked her when she
                  last saw him. She quickly answered-"About six months ago I went over there-and the
                  Queen was very jealous of me, but when she found out we were engaged to be
                  married, she was quite cordial in her manner, and received me daily at the
                  Castle."
               "This other piece of linen, ask him to wear in his waistcoat pocket-you see it has
                  'Forget me not' on it.
               "I know you will oblige me, sir, by doing this for me,-and now"-bending her lovely
                  face quite close to mine -she said:
                  "They think I'm mad-but I am not!-it's so hard to be kept in these strong stone
                  walls! So hard to sit day after day, at that little desk, poring over the dear
                  letters he has sent me-and waiting-O! how vainly-for the sound of his
                  footsteps!
               "But won't you influence at the Foreign Office in Downing street"-yes, she said
                  Downing street!-"to get my release?-won't you"-and with streaming eyes, burying
                  her face her hands, her magnificent dark hair falling over her neck and shoulders
                  in the greatest profusion, she sat down on a bench, in front of some beautiful
                  flowers.
               I confess I was unmanned, for nothing could be apparently more earnest of sincere
                  than her manner, nothing more terrible than her grief!
               Rising in a few moments, at the approach of the matron, she said;
               "I'm perfectly calm now; I don't often have these fits, but the met of your so
                  soon seeing the Prince, and carrying him these things, has affected me; and now,
                  once and for ever (I give her words as nearly as I can remember), let me reassure
                  you that I am in my right senses, and kept here against my will. Oh, madam
                  (looking at the matron), you are very kind, but very cruel in keeping me here; but
                  I'll go to my room and pray, it's all that's left me to do now; will you come and
                  see my little room?" and following her, with the keeper's permission, I stepped
                  into the apartment, kept scrupulously clean, the window open, though heavily
                  barred, and a portrait of Prince Albert framed with evergreen and wild
                  flowers!
               I was just about bidding her farewell, with my hand upon the door, when she seized
                  me by the arm, and with a vice-like grip pulled inside. Her face was deathly pale,
                  her eyes flashed fire, and with a hissing voice, sub dued, though terribly in
                  earnest, she said: "You've been deceiving me-you think I'm mad-you're like all the
                  rest-you shant go! I'll have my revenge, and-"for a moment, I am frank to confess,
                  I felt rather queer-nay, alarmed. It was impossible to move, and her eyes fixed on
                  me, seemed to change every second in their fiendish expression. Luckily, I saw the
                  handle of a bell-rope, which, with the disengaged hand, I hastily pulled. It was
                  answered by the keeper, whip in hand, at the sight of which she relaxed her hold,
                  and I instantly withdrew, leaving her weeping piteously.
               It was, indeed, a heart-sickening exhibition.
               I had fancied enough for one day of sin Insane Asylum, but, on the suggestion of
                  my guide that I should see something a little less tragic, we proceeded to the
                  "play-ground," a large open space, where certainly some comical and laughable
                  scenes were enacted.
               A fellow immediately rushed up to me, dressed like an Indian chief; face painted,
                  tomahawk in hand, feathers of all sizes stuck in his cap, and flourishing an old
                  musket barrel in his hand, he said:
               "Don't you know me? I'm the Emperor Napoleon I Yes, and you don't think this is
                  St. Helena; but I tell you those-English will feel me yet. There goes the fellow
                  (pointing to another patient) that took me prisoner! Ha! ha I ha!" and with a
                  whoop and a yell, he ran off.
               Then came up a man dressed like a policeman, who said to me:
               "I was hung about a week ago for committing murder; but I was acquitted
                  unanimously by the jury and put in here for safe-keeping; can't you get me
                  out?"
               Some were dancing, some singing, some sitting with their faces buried in their
                  hands, some sprawling on the ground, and so on. It was a sorry sight at the best,
                  and I prepared to take my departure; but, recurring for a moment to the poor
                  female first mentioned, when recently the news arrived here of the death of Prince
                  Albert, I could not help thinking of the above strange incident; and I fancied
                  that, perhaps, long since, she also may have found rest and relief in a visit from
                  the great leveller, Death.
            
            
               XCII.
               I MEET WITH AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW!
               PASSING by the Prince of Wales Theatre, I noticed on the bills that the play of
                  King Henry VIII. was to be performed that night-King Henry, Mr. G. H. Rogers.
               
               Now, that morning I had been informed that a Mr. George Herbert Rogers had
                  remarked to a friend that he thought that I was the same "Steve Massett" that was
                  his "chum" at Troy Town Academy.
               I too was satisfied that it must be the same, for the name was by no means a
                  common one, so to the stage-door I went, and sent in my card, which was instantly
                  acknowledged, by the doorkeeper's returning with the request that I would walk
                  into Mr, Rogers's dressing-room.
               In I went, my quondam schoolmate seated in all the regal splendor of a stage King
                  Henry! He jumped up, and to my question, "Well, George, my dear fellow, how are
                  you?" he seized me by the hand and shook it in a very genial though unkingly
                  manner!
               He had grown monstrously in size; was the father of a large family of children,
                  and the pet, if not the best, actor in the colonies.
               "We had a jolly laugh, and (between the acts) a chat, and a little "home-brewed"
                  arter the play.
               
                   
               
            
            

               XCIII.
               I AM PATRONIZED BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR AND SUITE.
               IT was suggested that if I could obtain the patronage of Sir William and Lady
                  Denison, it would greatly assist, as an attraction, in filling the house.
               Accordingly, presenting a note of introduction I had to one of the "A. D. C.'s," I
                  was very kindly received, and left with the consoling information that Sir William
                  and Lady Denison would be happy to attend.
               The entertainment went off with the greatest clat, and I cleared, by the two
                  hours' work, one hundred pounds!
               
               Bidding adieu to my esteemed friends the L.'s, not for-Getting many others who had
                  shown me much hospitality, left the good old city of Sydney for Hobart Town, Van
                  Diemen's land (now called Tasmania), in the steamship Tasmania, Captain Clinch, a
                  three days' trip, for which I paid 10.
               On the 17th June we passed Maria Island, a most beautiful looking spot c from the
                  sea, where Smith O'Brien and others were confined, and from which they most
                  fortunately escaped.
               
                  June 18.-Arrived at "Hobart Town." Put up at "Todd's Hotel."
               "Hobart Town" is an extremely gloomy looking place,-in fact it is a second
                  "Sydney," though on a smaller scale the same disagreeable "element" existing in
                  "society," that was noticeable in Sydney; and which, to a foreigner, is so
                  offensive.
               Talking of "Society," it seemed to me that there really was only one "first class"
                  or upper circle recognised at all in the Colonies; that was those immediately
                  connected with the respective Governments-the Government "Officials," and the
                  Officers of the Army and Navy.
               Into this "Circle" it is difficult to get-and it struck me that
                     distinctions were drawn with even a tighter rein than in
                  aristocratic London.
               
               I will give one or two instances. In a neighboring City during my visit, there
                  came off at the "Assembly Booms," what they call "a Race Ball," given by a
                  Committee of gentlemen composing the leading members of the "Club."
               The owner of the "Booms," and the lessee thereof, a very wealthy man at that-told
                  me himself, that much as he wished his daughter to be present, it would be
                  impossible for him or any of his family to be admitted. No money could purchase a
                  ticket. He was a "Tailor," and a very fashionable one at that-he was an
                  "outsider."
               Again, the proprietor of one of the Hotels-and the wealthy man-told me that he was
                  going to take his wife-that he couldn't often afford to "treat her," but this time
                  he was going to invest three pounds three shillings (about fifteen dollars) in a
                  ticket; (I heard afterwards) the moment it was known who the party was, he was
                  instantly rejected.
               One more instance-the most ridiculous of all-and I have done.
               A wealthy "Haberdasher," or as we call them "Dry Goods Merchants," applied for
                  tickets for himself and family; he being at that time looked upon as the very "A.
                  T. Stewart" of the Colony.
               He even was rejected because forsooth he "broke bulk," or in other words
                     retailed his merchandise.
               The entre into the best Colonial Society is open only and exclusively to three
                  professions-Divinity, Law, and Physic.
               On the 22d of June, at the "Royal Assembly Rooms," I gave my first "Ballad
                  Concert, and Readings from the Poets."
               It went off very successfully-the audience appeared pleased, and the receipts were
                  about forty-five pounds.
            
            
               XCIV.
               AMUSING LETTER FROM AN "AGENT."
               ONE of my "Agents," a regular out and out Yankee, whom we'll call Mr. Brick, had
                  been getting a little "tight," anglic "drunk,"-and as this happened more than
                  once, I wrote him a line stating that his services were no longer required. The
                  next day I received the following note:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                               
                                 S. C. MASSETT EQR., 
                              
                           
                           DEAR SIR:-Larst Monday was the fust time I got "little over the Bay,"
                              for the larst six months. The reason why I fell in with so many
                              friends in Different Hotels whilst I was working for you Concert, that
                              night I work harder that Day than I ever Did before to Get a house
                              that Night.
                           You got me wurse by torking to me; the way you did, I sold fore (4)
                              Tickets, which I have given you credic for them. If you want to see me
                              you ken find me to the Shakespere Hotel. I am about starting a Cumpany
                              here myself, providing if I can get Two persons which I want.
                           
                              Yours truly,
                              A. BRICK.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               My second entertainment was given under the "Patron-age" of His Excellency the
                  Governor, Sir Henry Edward Fox Young-Lady Young (formerly Miss Marryat), a most
                  delightful and fascinating lady-Sir Valentine Fleming, Lady Fleming, Lady
                  Campbell, besides many of the officers of the 12th Regiment.
               I was indebted for the above to the friendly offices of the Governor's aide-camp,
                  Captain Henry Maule; to whom I had a letter of introduction, and whose kindness
                  and hospitality during my brief sojourn in this city I cannot easily forget. To
                  him and his amiable wife, Lady Campbell, I offer my earnest thanks, and kindest
                  remembrances, and yet live in the hope of greeting them again.
               While at Hobart Town it was suggested that a Concert might be given at a suburban
                  village of "Oaklands," and "Campbelltown."
               Thither I went by stage.
               I was indebted for the use of a very good piano to a Mrs. Whiteford, daughter of
                  the celebrated actor, R. W. Elliston, of Drury Lane.
               
               From Hobart Town I went per mail coach, as in the old time, to Launceston, a
                  distance of 120 miles-fare 3.
               The road, made by the convicts, was one of the finest I had ever travelled on; the
                  weather was intensely cold, and before we arrived, the snow was falling fast.
                  Think of this in July!
               Put up at the Cornwall Hotel, attached to which was the Assembly Booms, and for
                  which they charged me 5 5s. a night.
               Here I met with the old New York favorite, Mr. John Dunn, or as he was more
                  familiarly known. "that Rascal Jack."
            
            
               XCV.
               STILL MOVING ON.
               IN a cozy little room, on the second floor of the before mentioned hotel, on a
                  cold and frosty night, comfortably seated in a couple of old-fashioned arm-chairs,
                  in front of a bright coal fire, were the writer of these lines, and Rascal Jack,
                  his excellent wife and daughter Rosa sitting on the sofa reading.
               The conversation was somewhat discursive, and ran into politics and the (then)
                  present condition of the Emperor of the French.
               "By the way, I see my quondam friend of other days, Mons. Henri, who was the stage
                  manager at the theatre in Paris while I was performing there, is now a very big
                  man-even the Count de Morney, the particular and personal friend of Louis
                  Napoleon."
               I asked him if he was quite certain as to the identity of the individual. "Quite,"
                  replied Jack Dunn; "and I only wish he'd return me the money I loaned him. It
                  would come in very appropriately just now."
               Upon questioning him further, he informed me that at the time Louis Napoleon was
                  imprisoned in the Castle of Ham, he loaned Mons. Henri, the present Count de
                  Morney, 15, which money was effectual in aiding Napoleon's escape.

               While in Hobart Town, I was informed that the Captain of a vessel bound for the
                  East Indies had remarked that if I had any disposition to visit those latitudes, a
                  state room in his ship was at my service.
               Now having made up my mind to visit Calcutta, I thought this was an opportunity
                  not to be slighted. Accordingly, I conferred with my friend Captain Maule, who
                  agreed with me on the propriety of accepting it.
               And now, as I am about ringing down the curtain on my brief sojourn in the
                  Australian Colonies, I intend letting ray readers into some of the secrets of the
                     profits thereof.
               Imprimis: Was there ever an instance on record of a public performer, male or
                  female, who in the announce bills, or the puffs preliminary, was not served up in
                  something of the following style:
               "His (or her) career and success was one complete triumph."-"Entertainments
                  crowded to suffocation;"-and "winning golden opinions from all sorts of men."
               Everywhere I went I was successful. Houses were crowded, if they did not contain
                  expenses, and audiences invariably delighted, charmed, and electrified.
               I had visited the four colonies, given readings in each, and upon referring to a
                  little memorandum by my side, I find the following figures: 
                     Gave Fifty-two Entertainments.

               The reader will perceive that I have long since fully appreciated the force of the
                  aphorism, "All that glitters is not gold."
               Still, with a light heart and several thin pairs of breeches (for I was going to a
                  hot climate), I sailed in the bark Fortune for Bombay.
            
            
               
               XCVI.
               OFF FOR INDIA!
               ON the 20th July, in the year of grace 1857, 1 sailed from Launceston, Van
                  Diemen's Land, for the East Indies.
               The reader has been informed that the Captain of the aforesaid vessel had extended
                  an invitation to me, and being rather prepossessed in his favor by his frank and
                  apparently open-hearted manner, I looked forward prospectively to a right jolly
                  time.
               I was the only passenger, excepting a Dr. E--, the surgeon of the ship, who had
                  accompanied the skipper from Liverpool, in one of James Baines's emigrant ships,
                  in the same capacity.
               Now, long ere this, the reader has, I trust, found out that I am a pretty good
                  sailor. The sensation of sea-sickness is to me unknown, and I am never so
                  perfectly happy or content as when on the water.
               It was, then, upon the third day out that I began to regret the step I had taken,
                  and to appreciate the hornets' nest into which I had unwittingly plunged
                  myself.
               I do not mention the name of my tormentor, in the person of the aforesaid captain,
                  nor the particulars of the hospitality extended to me, or the brutal treatment the
                  crew received.
               Dr. Johnson, I believe, likened a ship to "a prison, with the chance of being
                  drowned."
               Macaulay, in his eloquent speech on the life of Warren Hastings, says that "it is
                  on board a vessel, where there is nothing to drive away the dull monotony of the
                  voyage but quarrelling and love-making, that the deadliest enmities are
                  engendered, as also the most lasting attachments."
               The captain turned out to be of a most ungovernable temper, cruel, domineering,
                  exacting, suspicious, and arbitrary; and during a sixty days' residence on the
                  water with him fifty were passed by me seated at the same table, without
                  exchanging a word.

               Six of the crew were escaped convicts-their names and sentences were as
                  follows:
               
                  1. King, seven years, Port Arthur-forgery.
                  2. James Simmonds, fifteen years, Norfolk Island-stealing silver
                     plate.
                  3. Tom Johnson, eight years-mutiny.
                  4. Joe, five years, broaching cargo-V. D. L.
                  5. Wm. Johnson, five years, felony-V. D. Land.
                  6. Cook, three years.
               
               A lively lot!
               Had it not been for the gentlemanly first and second officers, W. Clerke and W.
                  Harwood, and the good-natured companionship of my medical friend, Dr. E--, I know
                  not what I should have done, and the reader will enter into my sensations of
                  delight, when on the sixty-third day out the "Towers of Bombay" loomed up in the
                  distance!
               
                   
               
               On Friday, the 18th September, I was once again on terra firma.
               The sensations of pleasure and delight that I experienced on landing at the stone
                  pier in the capital of British India, cannot be described. The feeling of
                  emancipation and freedom from the tyrannical presence of Captain --, a new life
                  seemed before me, and though alone, in a city of 800,000 souls, the changes, the
                  novelty of the scene, the delicious atmosphere, and the feeling of untrammelled independence, inspired me with hope,
                  and filled me with pleasant anticipations.
               I think it is Dickens who says "There are a few days in our lives which stand out
                  from all others we have ever known, days on which it seems to us as if the flood
                  of sunlight round us is gilded with so bright a glory, that, even the commonest
                  things on which it falls, glow with a beauty we never felt before, days on which
                  the fresh breeze passing over us, and sweeping through the green leaves overhead,
                  whispers ever to us to cast all sorrow from our hearts, for that in the great
                  world around us, there is infinite joy, and happiness, and love;" such a day was
                  this, and bright and beautiful with the blue clear sky, with the golden sunbeams,
                  with the light laughing wind, it rises in my memory now-a day never to be
                  forgotten.
               Jumping into my "palke" or "palankeen," a conveyance borne on the shoulders of
                  four natives, I wended my way to "Barnes's Hotel" in the Fort.
               Lying at full length upon a well stuffed mattress, covered with silk or morocco
                  leather, supported by pillows, having at the upper end a little shelf or drawer,
                  in which to stow away any small articles, I was greatly amused at the strange
                  sights and scenes that at every moment greeted me.
               Upon my arrival at the hotel the first thing to be done was to get a "peon," or
                  body servant, who could speak English, and accompany me in my peregrinations
                  through the city.
            
            
               XCVII.
               BOMBAY.
               BOMBAY, seen as you enter the bay from the Arabian Sea, is extremely attractive;
                  on either side rise up magnificent mountains, which mark the western boundaries of
                  the great continent of India. Then comes the island of Bombay with its large
                  fortress, manned and gunned-forming the inclosure to the town.

               I must confess that I was not particularly struck by the appearance of the city,
                  as I took my first evening stroll.
               The "Town Hall," a very imposing edifice of stone, is the most notable of the
                  public buildings, and in the large room thereof, capable of holding two thousand
                  persons, I gave my first entertainment.
               There is a small theatre in an out of the way locality, but no regular concert
                  room.
               But the fact is, the heat is so great, that there are only about three months in
                  the year at all available for public exhibitions, and then, the attraction must be
                  somewhat novel and exciting, to insure a large audience.
               Then the greater portion of the inhabitants reside at Malabar Hill, about four
                  miles from the town, and, as they usually dine at seven o'clock, the disposition
                  to stir out after a hearty repast, is not very great.
               I was much amused in going through the bazaars, commencing at the lively esplanade
                  where the fashionables take their evening drive, and ending in the dark forests of
                  cocoanuts at Mazagon, where reside numbers of Europeans.
               It seemed to me that no place I had as yet visited contained so motley a
                  population. Here then, passing and repassing, were Persians, Arabs, Parsees,
                  Chinese, Brahmins, half-naked, Armenians, Portuguese, Coolies, Hindoo clerks,
                  Abyssinians, Jews, Moguls; and the variety of languages spoken something fearful
                  to contemplate and listen to.
               The Roman Catholic churches and chapels are very numerous here. Mosques and Hindoo
                  temples are found in numbers, and the Parsees or Fire Worshippers have their
                  magnificent fire temples where the sacred fire is kept up by the priests all the
                  day long.
            
            
               
               XCVIII.
               A VISIT TO THE CAVES OF ELEPHANTA.
               I HAD heard so much said of the above place, that I resolved to be one of a party
                  to pay them a visit, and I shall proceed to give a sketch of the trip and
                  place.
               I have before spoken of the beauty of the harbor, and also of the charming marine
                  views that are presented constantly to the eye at the entrance of the bay; studded
                  as it is with picturesque little islands, having on one side the western Ghauts,
                  towering in the distance, and on the other the island of Bombay itself with its
                  dark fortress, wooded vales and hills, fishing villages, half concealed by groves
                  of splendid cocoanuts, and rocky promontories lashed by the sea; while to give
                  life to the scene there are the numerous and diversified shipping in the harbor,
                  with the flags of every nation flying at the peak, and native craft of various
                  sorts and sizes, gliding about under sail.
               The island of Elephanta, containing one of the largest of those extraordinary cave
                  temples, that I had heard so much of, is most romantically situated, and about
                  seven miles distant from Bombay.
               We reached it in about an hour and a half s sail. At first it appeared very small,
                  being indeed nothing more than a double-peaked, rocky, woody hill, with a narrow
                  valley winding between the peaks; and it is only about five miles in
                  circumference; but for exquisite beauty of verdure and foliage, and for
                  picturesqueness of form and position, the little island is indeed a gem.
               It struck me as very strange, that not even a jetty for landing had been
                  constructed, for the water is too shallow to permit a boat reaching the shore, and
                  the only way I had of getting to land dry-footed was on the shoulders of the
                  natives, and a comical sight we presented. One fat English woman, the wife of the
                  skipper of a British ship, presented a most extraordinary appearance. Though the
                  day happened to be quite sultry, she was encased in a heavy stuff woollen dress,
                  with a fur tippet on top, and a thick shawl over that, and when mounted on the
                  back of a sturdy native, who fairly tottered beneath the weight of this mountain
                  of flesh, she resembled more a huge balloon, with a couple of prime legs of mutton
                  dangling from the basket, than anything else I could think of; and her feet stowed
                  away in a pair of heavy cloth boots almost reaching to the calf, were swinging to
                  and fro, as if entirely disconnected from the mass of rotundity above.
               Added to this she was screaming at the top of her voice, "'Enry, 'Enry-this nasty
                  wretch is squeegeing me himproperly-I know he'll drop me hin!-to think of being
                  drowned hin this horful bay-Oh Lor-Oh Lor-I'm fainting-I know I am!"
               Upon landing she became suddenly pacified, and managed with the rest of us to get
                  up the steep ascent, once apparently a stone staircase, leading from the beach to
                  the great cave. This appeared to be an excavation about one hundred and fifty feet
                  long, and the same breadth nearly, and about twenty feet high, hewn out of a mass
                  of lofty rock.
               A great big colossal three-faced and many-armed bust is carved out of the rock, at
                  the upper end of the cave, and there are bas-reliefs of gigantic human figures in
                  various parts, as well as numerous smaller figures of Gods and Goddesses, some
                  with six arms, others with monkey heads, some grasping warlike instruments, some
                  serpents, besides other monstrous devices.
               Elephanta is possessed of a natural cistern, penetrating under the rock, full of
                  deliciously pure cold water, and I found it a most delightful beverage.
               The view I got from the cave's entrance is superb-the eye resting alternately upon
                  hills luxuriously wooded, valleys, islands, verdant and lovely, lying amid the
                  calm blue sea.
               Beside? the principal cavern, I noticed several smaller and seemingly unfinished
                  caves close by; but they appeared possessed of little interest.
               On the other side of the island stands the colossal figure of an elephant, to
                  which I was informed the name of the
                  place is generally ascribed. This rude piece of sculpture is now much
                  dilapidated-the head tying on the gound, some feet from the body-the legs sunk in
                  the earth.
               As to the constructors of the Cave Temples of Elephanta, conjectures without
                  number have been made. The opinion of my Hindoo guide on the subject, in answer to
                  my query, was: "God came doanee and made the cave in one nighty."
               There are not many "Worshippers" come nowadays to the caves, I was told. I noticed
                  a few, however, and I noticed more than one of the monkey-headed deities daubed
                  all over with red; as I found the custom with Hindoo images, and sacred emblems in
                  India.
               The sculptures in the caves have been much disfigured by the barbarous practice of
                  carrying and chipping off bits of the works as relics, and also of cutting names
                  and remarks on the columns, and along the sides of the cave. Here was one I made a
                  "note of"-C. S. Governor, April, 1501, rudely but very deeply cut in the big
                  three-faced bust.
               No more of these depredations now take place, for the caves are in charge of a
                  European sergeant, living in a bungalow close by-the only white inhabitant of the
                  island-and he, with his two sepoys, takes good care that the visitors do no damage
                  to the sculptures.
               Upon reaching the city late in the evening, we found the residents at the Fort in
                  a very excited state, at the receipt of some news just received from Poonah
                  relating to the rebellion-at this time raging at the highest pitch.
               
                  MY FIRST CONCERT.
                  The next day having been selected for my first appearance before an Eastern
                     audience, I did not feel particularly pleasant at the prospect-understanding
                     that orders had been sent by the Commander of the Fort, for all Europeans to
                     keep the closest watch, and not to leave their houses after dark.
                  My "programmes" of which there were some three thousand had been distributed
                     through the City and suburbs three days before. The three daily papers had
                     behaved very handsomely in preliminary notices, and my friends assured me that
                     I should be greeted with a crowded auditory.
                  The night of the 1st of October, Thursday, witnessed my debut.
                  The large room in the Town Hall (the front of which presented a brilliant
                     appearance, with variegated lights in form of flowers, and various devices) was
                     filled to repletion-the principal portion being Europeans. The front seats
                     occupied by wealthy Parsee merchants-prominent among them was the well known
                     Sir Curstejee Jejeebhoy, the wealthy Parsee baronet, the only instance I
                     believe on record of the title being borne by a native of these climes.
                  The heat was overpowering, and the immense size of the building, and the
                     unpleasant reverberation thereof, made the recitations indistinct-but assisted
                     the ballad portion of the entertainment.
                  The audience were (for a hot climate too!) enthusiastic in their applause, and
                     every piece went off most satisfactorily. I think during the performance I
                     changed my shirt three times, and used up half-a-dozen pocket-handkerchiefs;
                     punkas were going over head-every window raised-doors wide open-yet the heat
                     was stifling.
                  The papers on the following day were extremely kind and complimentary.
               
            
            
               XCIX.
               BLOWING AWAY FROM THE GUNS!
               IT was during my brief sojourn in Bombay, that I witnessed the fearful sight of
                  blowing men away from the guns-and when my readers are informed that the evening
                  of the day set apart by some of the natives for murdering the entire white
                  population-certainly those residing in the "Fort"-was the night selected for my
                  farewell concert-they will see how narrow was the escape!
               The mutinies then existing in the upper provinces of India spread until they
                  reached the City of Bombay, tainting
                  ing the fidelity of the 10th and 10th Infantry Regiments, and the native Marine
                  Battalion. Many men of both these regiments were captured at a little house near
                  the esplanade, where they were planning to rise on the night of the 15th of
                  October, during the native festival of the "Dewallee," and murder every man,
                  woman, and child, in the city.
               Two of these monsters were condemned, and sentenced to be blown from the cannon's
                  mouth.
               It appears then, that a Sepoy of the 10th Regiment called privately on the Deputy
                  Commissioner of Police, and after narrating all the details of the plot in course
                  of maturity, offered to give positive proof if the authorities would engage a room
                  adjoining that in which the conspirators were to hold their last meeting previous
                  to operations.
               Having been introduced to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, who spoke very good
                  English, he invited me (we first haying disguised ourselves) to accompany him upon
                  the critical mission.
               In a dingy native house, in one of the lowest districts of Bombay, imagine some
                  fifty natives, with a satanic gleam of moody satisfaction sparkling from their
                  deep black eyes, crowded on the dirty floor of a dark room.
               A deathlike silence ensues, as each one turns to a noncommissioned officer who
                  with a quiet triumph lays before them the full and mature plan.
               "Hist!" said the officer to me-"lie down-don't breathe-look through this hole!-see
                  their hands in each other's-they are taking now the most fearful oath known to the
                  Hindostanee."
               The bright eye of the commissioner peering through that mysterious little chink in
                  the dirty plaster, had providentially seen, heard, and found out their plan.
               "Up! up!" quickly whispered he, and flying with the velocity of a deer-I following
                  as quickly as possible-we jumped into a buggy, and rode to the Headquarters of the
                  Governor, Lord Elphinstone.
               The officer translated to His Excellency the plan as he heard it, as follows:
               The native soldiery of "regulars" were to disperse in small bodies in different
                  directions, and fire the fort, murder all the Europeans, then take possession of
                  the Treasury and Arsenal. The "budmashes" or vagabonds were to be rewarded by
                  having the outside bungalows, and the English families at Malabar Hill, and other
                  localities, left entirely to their disposal-there they would find lots of women
                  and children to ravish and massacre!
               In less time, it seems, than it takes me to write this, a mounted troop of armed
                  men flew across the esplanade, and with a fearful sound and crash the doors were
                  burst open, and the inmates one and all pinioned, and in one hour after, the cells
                  of Fort St. George contained them! So quietly and dexterously was this
                  accomplished, that nothing of it was known publicly, until the morning of the day
                  of execution.
               The afternoon of the 15th of October it will be difficult for me to forget.
               I was seated about one o'clock taking "tiffin" or lunch, in company with Lieut.
                  Timm, of the E. L C. service, chatting with him upon the probabilities of a good
                  or bad house for the concert of the evening, when he remarked: "I fear your
                  chances are rather slim, old fellow, to-night-for the fact is, it's my impression
                  that we shall all be in or near kingdom-come, by to-morrow morning!"
               I asked him what he meant? He replied; "The Commander-in-chief has just
                  telegraphed from Poonah to the Colonel of the regiment here, that the sentence is
                  to be carried into effect upon the two ringleaders this afternoon, and at five,
                  they are to be 'blown away.'" Adding-"I fear the natives will rise en masse, and murder us all!" asking me, at the same
                  time, if I had a "Colt?"
               I was too sick at the prospect to joke or I'd have replied, that I would like to
                  run off on the back of one, if I could! So I replied, that I had never carried any
                  firearms in any of my travels-and that I did not even know how to load a pistol!
                  "Well, well," he replied; "I've got a six-barrelled one; you go on to the
                  esplanade with me; we'll keep together-and the worst come to the worst, we'll die
                  together."
               With these reflections, and giving up all idea of "exhibiting" that night, we left
                  the Hotel for the scene of death.
               I have before spoken of the beauty of the harbor, and the surroundings of this city, and the magnificence
                  of its situation.
               The harbor is certainly not inferior to any in the world, the beauty and splendor
                  of its scenery are unrivalled, and indeed, many think it surpasses the far-famed
                  bay of Naples.
               In what is called the fair portion of the year, the vision is delighted amidst the
                  fairy tracery of purple hills, and during the "monsoon" the sublimity of the
                  tempest, and the storm careering in all the grandeur of the Torrid Zone, strikes
                  awe into the inmost recesses of every heart.
               As I gazed, the harbor looked calm and still as an inland sea, which had never
                  felt ebb or flow of tide; flags of every nation fluttered in the orient breeze,
                  and as the sun descended towards the horizon, the big city lay bathed in a sea of
                  gold, and the glories of the setting luminary were painted in gorgeous crimson
                  pictures on the western sky.
               The Ghauts mountains, richly wooded to their base, showed in the gilded atmosphere
                  their castellated summits, as if upon their tops Titans had reared their
                  fortresses.
               The nearer landscape, decked in milder beauty, exhibited the ever graceful palm;
                  the hoary banyan tree that counts centuries as years; the stately nym, with leaves
                  that whisper to the wind; birds with the most brilliant and glittering plumage
                  flitted about; the cooling gentle rippling waves of the Arabian Sea, as they
                  kissed in broken murmurs the yellow beach, and the hum of a city numbering 800,000
                  souls, spoke in solemn tones of the dreadful example which a mighty race was about
                  to exhibit for the domination and the punishment of one inferior, treacherous, and
                  cruel.
               I was standing on the esplanade, and the dread hour of five was fast
                  approaching.
               Out of every gateway from the Fort, natives and Europeans were thronging to the
                  military parade ground, while from the native town, alley, street, and lane,
                  disgorged their thousands.
               Every nation under the sun had a representative there to witness the appalling
                  spectacle so soon to occur.
               At half-past four the troops composing the garrison moved to the ground. Of the
                  English soldiery, there were only some 200 of H. M.'s 95th regiment, just arrived
                  from the Cape of Good Hope; 200 seamen, American and English, had hastily landed
                  from the ships in the harbor, armed with musket and bayonet.
               There were also a four-gun battery of foot artillery, and three guns manned by the
                  artisans of the Grand Arsenal.
               The whole English force numbering only 500 men-against which were some 6000,-near
                  them was a group of English and American captains of merchants' ships, and numbers
                  of the civilian population. The parade formed three sides of a square.
               The base was occupied by the artillery at the centre; the right and left sides
                  were composed of the 10th and 11th Sepoy regiments, to which the prisoners
                  belonged.
               Facing these Sepoys were placed three guns, behind which the artillerymen stood,
                  with matches lighted-ready to meet with deadly ball, the first movement towards
                  revolt.
               Between the six cannons, three pointing obliquely to either side, were placed at
                  right angles to the base of the square the two guns assigned for the awful
                  vengeance or justice of the hour. Between and in the rear of them, were arranged
                  the stern guard, and the condemned wretches whose lives were so soon to
                  terminate.
               Thanks to the courtesy of Brigadier Shoutt, commanding the garrison, and Captain
                  William Walker, I was permitted to take my position within six feet of the right
                  hand gun, and such a spectacle as I then witnessed will live in my memory for
                  ever.
               There was no outward excitement, such as attends ordinary public executions; no
                  swaying to and fro of the multitude.
               In all that vast assemblage of 100,000 human beings, a whisper would have broken
                  the stillness.
               The English officers rode along the lines, silent and severe of aspect. The champ
                  of their horses' bits, the clank of their sabres seemed loud and troublesome, as
                  they jarred the all-pervading quiet.
               At five o'clock the Brigadier rode in front of the death guns-and for a moment the
                  silence of the grave prevailed. It was
                  only interrupted, when a voice audible to the most distant of the listening
                  multitude, read in tones, clear, solemn, and firm, the sentence of the Court
                  Martial.
               In the language of Hindoostan, it smote the ear and hearts of the convicts.
               Thus it was rendered to me:
               "The Court, having found you guilty of attending a seditious meeting in Bombay,
                  and of having made use of highly mutinous and seditious language, evincing a
                  traitorous disposition towards the Government, tending to promote rebellion
                  against the state, and to subvert its authority (the above being in breach of the
                  articles of war), sentence you (Drill Havildar Syneed Hoseen' of the Marine
                  Battalion, Native Infantry, and Private 'Mungall Guddrew' of No. 8 Company, 10th
                  Regiment Native Infantry, to suffer death by being blown away from the muzzle of a
                  cannon."
               
                   
               
               The two men were then ordered to divest themselves of their regimental jackets.
                  This was quickly done; they were then marched between files of the European guard,
                  each to a cannon's mouth, and there bound tightly with ropes.

               The culprit "Drill Havildar" appeared composed, and assumed an attitude erect and
                  even dignified, until he found himself in the grasp of the artillery-men.
               He gazed imploringly upon the Regiment to which he had belonged-expecting, I
                  thought, that they might rush to his rescue.
               He made a last appeal!
               "Oh! Sahib captain-Sahib! pardon-dear-dear captain!"
               They stood before him motionless! and that guilty breast where sanguinary resolves
                  had arranged the midnight slaughter of defenceless men, women, and children, now
                  heaved with the mental agony of the doomed conspirator.
               While the two men were being bound, not a syllable was uttered by the assembled
                  crowd; the suspense lengthened seconds into minutes.
               All eyes were turned for an instant from the prisoners to the Native Regiments-but
                  they moved not.
               A rattling of steel along the line, gave notice that the Enfield rifle was
                  prepared to visit mutiny with slaughter.
               As the word "Prime" fell upon the ear, I noticed the 10th Native Infantry shook,
                  as by an electric thrill.
               It was now quite evident they might have feared that at the next moment the deadly
                  rifles might be levelled against their front.
               Simultaneously with the loading of the Infantry, the guns to the right and left of
                  the criminals were pointed at the two native regiments, loaded to the muzzle with
                  canister and grape-and there the gunners stood with signal match, lighted.
               From the ramparts at the Fort, four sixty-eight pounders looked threateningly upon
                  the scene.
               When the final summons was given-the handcuffs and uniform jackets removed-and the
                  English gunners were lashing the traitors with their backs to the cannon's mouth,
                  it was really fearful to notice the wild despairing expression in the faces of the
                  doomed.
               There was another pause; again the silence became oppressive-thousands, and
                  thousands of eyes, riveted their gaze upon the victims; and the heart of the
                  strongest there stirred more quickly,
                  when arose from Captain Bolton of the Royal Artillery, the command-
               "Let all retire from the guns-except the men with the portfires."
               "At the word 'Fire'-apply the match!"
               When the word "Ready" was given by Captain Bolton-the gunners in a moment lighted
                  their matches-the prisoners and the artillery-men stood immovable as statues.
               The awful word "Fire" rang out clear as a clarion note-the hammers descended on
                  the caps-the smoke rolled upwards in sluggish clouds-the cannons spoke as in tones
                  of thunder, and the air revealed by many a ghastly witness that retribution had
                  been terribly visited upon those who designed to revel and to dabble in the blood
                  of massacre.
               I did not linger at the place of sacrifice. Life is of motley garb-mine has
                  presented, the reader will have by this time perceived, the giddy and the sombre
                  in strange and often painful association.
               It seems to me that Hogarth did well to represent beside the coffin of the dead
                  harlot, the thoughtless boy, winding up his top!
               I wended my way from a scene of terror, to prepare for one of business-though, as
                  the reader will imagine, with a very sad heart!
               My entertainment was advertised to "come off" this night at the Town Hall-but what
                  with the frightful incident I have just endeavored to describe, and the common
                  apprehension that an outbreak of the natives would immediately succeed it, I
                  supposed my programme would attract no one-and to tell the truth when I entered my
                  "palke" to be carried to my hotel, I fancied I resembled more Mr. Bob Acres than
                  Sir Lucius O' Trigger! for I fear it is one of my characteristics, that I would
                  rather continue this mortal existence, and forego posthumous fame, than to fall in
                  the noblest battle, and live in history!
               There's no disputing about tastes!
               To my great surprise, however, there was a crowded house-among the number a large
                  sprinkling of Parsees and wealthy Hindoo merchants. This too, while on the
                  outskirts of the trembling city, many a father kept midnight vigil with belted
                  sword, and revolver clutched, fearing the desolating storm of native revenge.
               The "inhumanity," as it is called, of the above mode of dealing with this
                  miserable class of human beings, has been so often referred to, the mode of
                  punishment being deemed in the highest degree "barbarous," I shall simply upon
                  this subject give one extract from a letter, handed me to read in California,
                  prior to its being sent to England, by which the fiendish atrocities practised by
                  these brutes will more fully appear.
               The commercial letter of Messrs. Mackay and Co., dated Calcutta, 18th of June,
                  describes some of the atrocities committed by the revolted troops in various parts
                  of the Bengal presidency:
               "Imagine the father of a, family, bound hand and foot, compelled to witness the
                  dishonor of his wife by-we are afraid to say how many of these fiendish crew; and
                  then, when the poor creature was almost dead from the effect of their brutal
                  assault, they cut her across the abdomen, and drew forth an unborn babe, and
                  dashed it against the ground, and then hung the lifeless remains around the neck
                  of the manacled and distracted father. The villains, still thinking something
                  wanting to aggravate his feelings of horror and dismay, severed the head from the
                  body of the mother, and bound this also around his neck. Not yet satisfied with
                  their dreadful work, they seized the poor man's two remaining children, infants of
                  three and four years old, killed them, cut off their heads, and strung them also
                  around his neck, taunting him with all the obscene language the native dialect so
                  readily furnishes, until they thought he was dying, and when, fearing they might
                  lose the last opportunity of torturing the man, a dagger was plunged into his
                  heart, and he died, with the heads of all those he held most dear on this earth
                  resting lifelessly upon his breast. We have related but one instance only amongst
                  the many that have come to our knowledge-whereas almost every act of these
                  villains has been marked with something equally horrible."
               The principal public buildings within the town of Bombay, are the Town Hall, the
                  Docks, the Government House, two
                  churches, the Mint, the barracks, and the Castle, containing the Arsenal.
               All these are on a large and handsome scale. The private residences are ornamented
                  with flat roofs, terraces, balustrades, and garden flats. The Governor resides at
                  Malabar Hill, or Point, a bungalow erected upon a rock projecting into the sea at
                  the extreme westerly point of the island.
               As I have before said, the scenery in and about the Island of Bombay is
                  enchantingly beautiful, because of the admixture of rice plains, gardens, handsome
                  bungalows, and wooded hills, with occasional peeps of the sea shore, and the open
                  main, or landlocked bays. Some of the little villages near the city are densely
                  planted with cocoanut groves.
            
            
               C.
               A WORD AT PARTING.
               THE hospitality, kind-heartedness, and generosity with which a stranger is
                  received in India, are well known.
               In returning thanks at this great distance, to those who received me so cordially
                  (and especially to my brethren of the masonic order, here and in Calcutta, I make
                  my most affectionate acknowledgments), I cannot resist mentioning Mr. Mawson and
                  Mr. Pym of the Gazette, Captain Wm. Wacker, Dr. Buist, Sir Cursteje Jamsteje, Mr.
                  George Craig of the Telegraph and Courier, among those most kind, and who did
                  everything in their power to render my sojourn agreeable.
               Having given my farewell entertainment, I bade goodbye to my friends, and sailed
                  in the American bark Sabine, Captain Thos. H. Hendee, for Calcutta.
               On the morning of November 2d, 1857, the pilot left us, and we stood out for sea.
                  We have for passengers the supercargo, Mr. T. S. Tredick (whose father owns the
                  ship), Major Smeaton of the Bengal army, a Mr. Briggs, and myself.
               After my experiences on board the bark "Fortune," I felt a little cautious in the
                  selection of a ship in which to make another voyage; as this was the only vessel
                  up for Calcutta, I had no alternative but to take passage in her, and I am happy
                  to say, a more delightful time upon the deep blue sea I never passed. The captain,
                  a most delightful fellow, and every inch a sailor, did everything to make our time
                  pass agreeably, and though the most annoying succession of calms prevailed, the
                  time passed most agreeably, and I almost regretted when on the thirtieth day we
                  reached the Ganges, and took on board a pilot.
            
            
               CI.
               CALCUTTA.
               I WAS perfectly charmed with the exquisite scenery on the banks of this river.
               Mr. I. H. Stockqueler, in his interesting book upon British India, remarks: "It is
                  astonishing that so little has ever been said and written about the extraordinary
                  beauty of the banks of the Hooghly, in the environs of Calcutta. The scenery on
                  either side of the river is charming. The mariner who has, during a long period,
                  gazed upon nothing excepting sky and water, must fancy that Paradise has opened
                  upon his wondering eyes. While the upper provinces of India, though boasting
                  grander features (the Hooghly being the most sublime object in the picture we are
                  contemplating), present, at various seasons of the year, very different aspects,
                  Bengal is always the same. The moisture of its climate, and the nature of the
                  soil, concur in preserving an eternal verdure, which is only to be seen during the
                  season of the rains in the more and districts. Even in the hottest weather, when
                  the thermometer is up to 130, perhaps for weeks together, and when the sun pours
                  down so fierce a flood of light that it would seem as if its scorching influence
                  were sufficient to dry up every blade of grass, the whole earth is covered with a
                  rich carpet, and the moment that the
                  sun sets, a refreshing coolness fills the air, and the eyes revel upon scenery of
                  the richest luxuriance.
               Calcutta, or, as it is sometimes called, the "City of Palaces," is looked upon as
                  the metropolis of British India.
               As I caught the first glimpse of it from a beautiful bend in the river, known as
                  "Garden Reach," as our vessel slowly proceeded, the effect was of picturesque and
                  matchless beauty.
               About half a mile from the anchorage of the shipping, the whole splendor of the
                  city at once bursts upon the sight.
               The vast domes of the Government House, with its gates so superbly ornamented, the
                  lofty spires of the numerous churches, numbers of public offices, magnificent
                  private mansions, all faced with the purest white stucco, gracefully relieved by
                  green Venetian blinds; numberless vast and handsomely built landing-places, the
                  bishop's college, with its gothic towers, while we seemed surrounded by a perfect
                  forest of noble masts, of every size and shape, green and luxuriantly fitted up;
                  barges lying idly for hire, with their bright yellow rooms, altogether presented a
                  picture of life and surpassing beauty.
               Upon landing I found that between Fort William and the tower, about opposite the
                  anchorage, there is a beautiful and well watered plain, called a Maidaun, somewhat similar to the esplanade in Bombay, on one side of which runs
                  an aqueduct, and on the other side a handsome wide road, which every evening is
                  crowded with every imaginable style of vehicles, and numbers of equestrians.
               I made my way to Spence's Hotel, and having met Mr. Henry Coleman, mentioned in my
                  Australian notes, he proceeded to advise me in reference, to my opening night.
               At Spence's I was furnished with a large airy room, and capital fodder (all
                  excepting the butter, a thing you carnt get for any
                  money in India!) for one hundred rupees (fifty dollars) a month. I had scarcely
                  taken a seat at the table when my eye rested upon an old Californian, Aza Marvin,
                  of the firm of Marvin and Hitchcock, the San Francisco pioneer book-store; and
                  here I must also return him my thanks for his civilities and attentions. Flashing
                  by me on a high mettled charger, dressed in the cool and snowy habiliments of the
                  time, and looking handsome and bronzed with travel, was Charley S-- one of the
                  lucky bankers of San Francisco, who was on his way to Thebes; while lying at
                  anchor was the stately steamship "Golden Fleece," then commanded by my kinsman
                  Captain John Vine Hall.
            
            
               CII.
               I MEET WITH CAPTAIN HALL AFTER AN ABSENCE OF TWENTY YEARS!
               I WAS sitting quietly in my room, reading the morning paper, when I received a
                  note from Captain Hall, requesting my immediate presence on board his
                  steamship.
               The meeting was most cordial, and questions flew thick and fast, as to my doings
                  since as a small boy I parted from him at the London Coffee House in 1837!
               He was about leaving for England, via the Cape of Good Hope, and the island of St.
                  Helena, and though the temptation to reach England by that trip was very great, my
                  friend offering me a passage, I had made up my mind to take the overland route;
                  and accordingly could not avail myself of his kindness.
               On the 17th December, I gave my first concert at the Masonic Hall, Calcutta, to
                  one of the largest and decidedly most enthusiastic and aristocratic audiences, I
                  have ever had the honor of appearing before.
               Now, in these pages, I have been pretty frank and communicative with my readers,
                  and if I had a chance to ring in a laugh at my own expense, I have done so, and as
                  they have been informed that the result of my successful and brilliant career in
                  the colonies of Australia was a profit of 1.10 currency, or $7.50 American coin-so
                  shall they know the receipts of my entertainments during my brief residence in
                  India.
               In Bombay I gave four ballad concerts and readings, total receipts
                  4931 rupees. In Calcutta I gave one ballad concert and reading, receipts 1285 rupees. In
                     Howiah, a country village on the opposite side of the Hooghly, one
                  entertainment, receipts 450 rupees, total 6666 rupees, or 666.6-thirty-five
                     hundred dollars American currency-and I think, my friends on this side
                  of the water will agree with me that for six entertainments this is a pretty fair
                  result.
               The reader inquires about the expenses-I think 200 will cover them, so that I had
                  about two thousand dollars clear.
               And now, as I am about closing the brief account of my career in India, I wish to
                  say a word or two in reference to my first and last
                  appearance in this beautiful city.
               The Masons very kindly gave me the use of their hall, and in every way were most
                  obliging. To Messrs. Burkingyoing, the music-sellers, I am indebted for many acts
                  of courtesy, and for the use of a very fine Erard's piano.
               They sold also over four hundred tickets at two and a half dollars each, more by
                  two hundred than they ever disposed of before for any entertainment.
               The papers not only were very generous in the preliminary notices, but upon the
                  day after the concert the three dailies, entirely unsolicited, and
                  without my being personally acquainted with either of the editors, came out in the
                  most enthusiastic manner, relating to my appearance.
               
                   
               
            
            

               CIII.
               STREETS, HOTELS, ETC., ETC., ETC.
               THE streets, private houses, and hotels in this city are greatly superior to those
                  of Bombay.
               The Auckland, almost as large as the Metropolitan in New York, and Spence's are
                  the best.
               The expense of living does not exceed 100 rupees or $50 a month, including
                  bed-room and three meals a day, without wine.
               The Town-Hall is a very handsome and spacious edifice, where the public meetings
                  and dinners are given. The Courts of Justice, the Supreme Court, the Bengal Club,
                  the Markets, the Government House, and the Racket Court, while the steeple of St.
                  Paul's Cathedral, a really beautiful structure, reminds the looker-on of its
                  excellent founder, the Right Reverend Bishop Wilson. Street after street is filled
                  with stately buildings, showing the commercial importance of this city, as well as
                  the ample means of the inhabitants and the liberal spirit which has contributed to
                  the foundation of its many public institutions, or the tolerance of its people in
                  religious concerns.
               In the Metcalf Hall (a splendid building) is a very large public library, the
                  Museum, and Library of the Agricultural and Asiatic Society; the Custom House, the
                  Mint, a magnificent structure with gardens in front, Roman Catholic and Protestant
                  churches, Hindoo Pagodas and Mahomedan Mosques, Medical Colleges, Masonic Lodges,
                  numberless shops, filled with the richest articles of merchandise, whose gay
                  windows and attractive show-cases dazzle the eye or tickle the fancy as if walking
                  in Broadway or the Boulevards, all impart an importance and grandeur to this
                  beautiful city.
               Recentlv, in Calcutta, the electric telegraph has been introduced, and it was
                  found most useful in the late rebellion.
               Here also flourish a race-course and a cricket ground, and the lovers of archery, rackets, and of aquatic
                  sports have their respective "head-quarters."
               And now, having taken my passage in the Peninsula and Oriental Company's steamship
                  Candia, Captain Woodgate (a splendid fellow, by the way), for Aden, I shall say
                  good-by to my hospitable friends in this place, and wishing them a "Merry
                  Christmas" and a "Happy New Year," proceed upon my rambles.
            
            
               CIV.
               VOYAGE FROM CALCUTTA TO SUEZ.
               IN the first place, then, to fully appreciate the luxuriousness of travel on the
                  "deep blue sea," you must take passage in one of the Peninsular and Oriental
                  Company's steamships.
               Large, airy state rooms, bathing rooms, wines and liquors of all kinds, ad libitum, obliging and attentive waiters, tables
                  most sumptuously supplied, and the officers, from the highest to the most
                  unimportant, gentlemanly, considerate, and obliging.
               Then there is but "one class" of passengers-no "steerage," no intermediate-and, as
                  a general rule, the time passes most delightfully.
               I paid 1,050 rupees for my through ticket, or about $600. This, for a voyage of
                  thirty days, appears rather expensive, but the trip is well worth it, and will
                  ever remain in my memory as the most delightful of my "journeyings."
               On the fourth day we arrived at Madras.
            
            
               CV.
               MADRAS.
               WE anchored in the Roads. It is very dangerous to land here. A tremendous surf
                  rolls towards the shore with such fearful force, at certain seasons, that the
                  greatest care has to be taken by the boatmen, or, they must inevitably be
                  swamped.
               A very few hours on shore will suffice to instruct, amuse, or charm you.
               The Madras houses, resting upon the sea-shore, are of white and pale yellow stucco
                  with Venetian blinds. The total absence of all shade is extremely offensive to the
                  eye.
               We ordered dinner at one of the hotels, and started to see the sights. Went to the
                  Hindoo school and the place where they burn the dead; returning, went into the
                  Madras Club, where, I was kindly received by the members.
               Found the Golden Fleece steamship here.
               Two days more brought us to the Island of Ceylon. Went on shore at Point de
                  Galle.
               After rambling about for several hours at the Island of Ceylon, picking oranges
                  from the trees, inhaling the balmy atmosphere, my olfactories tickled by the
                  fragrance of the spicy groves, and causing me to sing (to myself) the Missionary
                  Hymn, we started once again for Aden.
            
            
               CVI.
               ADEN.
               ARRIVING here at 12 A. M., in seven days.
               
                  Friday, 8th January.-I went on shore. A strange
                  looking place, sure enough, is this! Called, I heard, the Gibraltar of Arabia!
               Desolation, decay, and ruin seemed to reign supreme. Rocks barren, immense plains
                  of sand, no sign of animated nature, and no sound save the incessant "braying of
                  your donkey greets your ear."
               The instant you land, an Arab horse or donkey is brought to you; upon one of these
                  docile animals I was gently carried to the city (?) called Conception, some four
                  miles off, and with the exception of being chased by some Arabs (I having for the
                  time lost my companions), who, doubtless, observing the shaky style of both rider
                  and jackass, thought the capture both
                  desirable and easy, I had a very agreeable and funny trip of it.
            
            
               CVII.
               SUEZ.
               ON the 15th January we arrived at Suez, not a very inviting locality externally.
                  On shore everything denotes wretchedness and poverty.
               The houses, built of large lumps of rock, cemented by mud or clay, mixed with
                  water and sand; the inhabitants, looking uncomfortable and dirty, Arabs,
                  Egyptians, and Turks; caravans of camels loading for Cairo, donkeys all ready for
                  going, females veiled and masked, present a scene, to say the least, novel and
                  exciting.
               The hotel here was miserable, and heartily glad was I, after drawing lots for a
                  seat in the Van to carry us partly over the desert, to find that at six we were to
                  start.
               These "Vans" are a sort of two-wheeled carriage, and carry six inside
                  passengers-no springs, no ventilation, no room.
               In the one in which I had a seat, a fat woman was my vis--vis; her weight (some 400) was too much for the concern, and
                  down we all came.
               The scene was most comical, the heat was great, the dust greater, and the delay
                  annoying!
               Some hours were consumed in repairing our conveyance, and about midnight we found,
                  ourselves in the middle of the desert, where the "snorting" of a great big
                  steam-engine gave notice that the "cars" were in readiness to convey us the
                  balance of our journey.
               Yes! after having for a while anchored where the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, I
                  found myself on the spot where "Joseph and his brethren" swapped coats, or where
                  Moses and Sons (now of Houndsditch in the city of London) rested with their
                  camels, jumping into a superb railroad car in which to make my entry into the
                  far-famed city of Cairo! and the first view of the Pyramids of Egypt.

               In 1856, Mr. George Francis Train, in his "Young America," says: "A telegraphic
                  wire has been ordered, a railroad is under way, and shortly the
                  whistling of a locomotive will startle the Bedouin from his sleep on his sandy
                  pillow, and the rattling of a railway train across the bleached skeletons of the
                  ass, the camel, the mule, will prove the sweetest of all sounds to those poor
                  beasts of burden, whose labors have been so greatly lessened by the genius and the
                  ingenuity of civilized man."
               On the 16th January, 1858, I arrived in the first train of cars, and
                  with lighted flambeaux was escorted to a really palatial-looking building called
                  the British Hotel.
            
            
               CVIII.
               SHEPARD'S BRITISH HOTEL.
               THE largest and best hotel in Egypt. The landlord has realized a fortune by his
                  twelve or thirteen years' "keeping a hotel," and is consequently somewhat
                  indifferent to the comforts of his guests. All is (or was) confusion, disorder,
                  and -- Egyptian! though from the advertisement on the back of his "card" (and
                  which I subjoin) you would expect the comforts of the Fifth Avenue Hotel m New
                  York, or Long's in Bond street.
               
                  THE BRITISH HOTEL.

                     Within five minutes' walk of the Railroad Station.
                  The proprietor of this well known establishment, begs to call the attention of
                     the Nobility, Gentry, and Travellers in recent alterations and improvements in
                     this Hotel, which, combined with every comfort and convenience, attention
                        and moderate charges, he hopes will obtain a continuance of the
                     support he has so long enjoyed.
                  The wines, spirits, ales, & c., are of the first quality.
                  
                  How this announcement would have astonished, and perhaps delighted the
                     Egyptians of other days.
                  We found the hotel pretty full, and comfortable apartments somewhat difficult
                     to obtain.
                  Took an early stroll through the city, reminding me very much of Constantinople
                     and Smyrna, in the narrowness and dirt of the badly paved streets, and motley
                     and grotesque appearance of the people.
                  Swift Arab horses, slow and sure-footed donkeys, with now and then a camel,
                     standing in front of dirty bazaars or trotting by me, with their living
                     freight, passed and repassed; my guide directing my attention first to the
                     citadel mosque, where were the tombs of Mehemet Ali, called the most
                     magnificent in Egypt. I got on the back of one of these mu-ils, and proceeded
                     on my explorations.
               
            
            
               CIX.
               EGYPT.
               MY reminiscences of Egypt must necessarily be very meagre and limited, on account
                  of the limited period of my sojourn in that mysterious land.
               But managing to remain long enough to see the Pyramids, Pompey's pillar, and
                     threading my way to Cleopatra's needle, besides being one of the
                  pioneers of travel in the first train of cars that puffed and snorted its way
                  across the desert, I feel a pleasure in devoting a page or so, worked up from
                  stray notes made here and there in Alexandria.
               It is all very well, and perhaps easy for that matter, to write learned pages
                  about Egypt Library shelves fairly groan with ponderous works on the subject, from
                  which it were easy to copy; and to tell the truth, there is really something so
                  mysterious, and almost sacred about the country, that it is difficult to resist
                  the temptation of burnishing up one's school-boy teachings; but as my readers have
                  long, ere this, become familiar with my "style," they will be spared the
                  infliction of any very learned disquisitions upon the subject.
               The climate here, it seemed to me, was most beautiful and inspiriting, and yet it
                  appeared that the moon and the stars shone forth with a calm and serene beauty
                  scarcely seen by me before, so exquisite was the scene on the night of my arrival;
                  and then was it not worth the voyage to see the Pyramids bathed in the soft
                  moonlight?
               As I walked through some of the graveyards-of which there appeared to be numbers
                  in Cairo-they seemed to me to be filled with the most delicious flowers; and I was
                  informed that the Egyptians have the greatest affection for the simple and
                  beautiful in nature-a little flower having more attraction for them than even an
                  elaborate piece of machinery, or a sculptured work of marble. And after all, is
                  this such poor philosophy? Isn't the heart made better by it? 
                     "Behold the lilies of the field! they toil not, neither do they spin; and
                        yet I say unto you, that Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one
                        of these."
                  
               
               I love flowers!-sweet is the ministry of even the humblest. We give them to the
                  youthful bride; we lay them upon the pillow of the dead and upon their coffins,
                  and plant them beside their graves; they are strewed in the pathway of the
                  returning hero; and when festal days come round, they are twined into bright and
                  fragrant garlands-and I say there is meaning, heart-meaning in their language.
               I notice groups of Egyptian men and women resting by the graves of the keepers,
                  and strewing upon and about them fresh and fragrant flowers. 'Tis a pretty fancy,
                  at any rate, for they think the spirits of the loved and lost linger around-and
                  perhaps they do-who can tell!
               In all lands, and at all times, I think this notion-if I may so call it-has had a
                  more or less strong hold upon the human mind. The Divine Teacher himself said of
                  them: "Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister" to us?
               Perhaps some day we may better appreciate this unseen agency, and not think so
                  disparagingly of the Easterns for it.
                  And I think it would be a great deal better to believe in the "ghost stories" of
                  old time nurseries, than not to believe in incorporeal presences;
                  restrained by Divine revelation, it tends, I doubt not, to unmaterialize our
                  natures.
               Say what we may of Mahomedism, it seemed to me that there were some touching, nay,
                  poetic beauties in it. It is a calm, contemplative, and almost unchanging faith, a
                  great contrast to the Kaleidoscope-"isms" of the present age, where, in almost
                  every street, city, town, village, and hamlet, we find places where people of all
                  kinds of differing creeds meet, each having a different way of getting to
                  heaven-each claiming to be the bright, particular, and only path to the heavenly
                  life.
               Another, to me, inexpressibly redeeming grace, has this same Mohammedism-the
                     grace of personal cleanliness! for it seemed to me they were washing and
                  bathing themselves all the time, and in clear running water; they have five daily
                  ablutions, I was informed.
               And now, winding up my short dissertation upon the disciples of Mahomet, I will
                  inform the reader, that in the matter of "wives" (and I tell you I got a peep
                  through the bars at a lot of beauties that had just arrived from the far-off
                  Circassia)-the Mussulman is not on very short allowance; for he is permitted by
                  his religion, four of the "second sex," as Miss Harriet Martineau styled them-and
                  as far as his religious actions go, it is briefly this: that prayer
                  takes the soul half-way to heaven-fasting to the door of that
                  abode-and charity and benevolence take him and I think there have been worse
                  platforms than this.
            
            
               CX.
               SOMETHING ABOUT THE PYRAMIDS.
               IT was a bright delicious morning when we started for the Pyramids; and by the
                  way, no pen can describe the beauty of the early mornings here; the heavy dews had
                  refreshed the earth and laid the dust-the latter the greatest annoyance in
                  Egypt.

               I had enjoyed one of Shepard's gorgeous baths, and refreshed the inner man with a
                  breakfast fit for an Emperor; what we had before breakfast it may not be necessary
                  to particularize.
               My fat old friend, Captain M--, who is an orthodox oracle in such matters,
                  recommended it, and we gracefully submitted to the prescription.
               In all strange lands the recommendation of an old and observant resident,
                  especially in such matters, is not to be slightly regarded; if it had been in any
                  other place than poetic Egypt, the dose might have been called the unpoetic name
                  of gin-cock-tail. At all events, it was not at all u bad to take," as
                  the jolly party unanimously decided.
               By the way, this fat friend, the old Captain, has taught the folks there a good
                  deal about American drinks, and from what I saw, I should sav they take very
                  kindly to them.
               
                   
               
               Although a slight digression, and in these short waifs and strays of my Egyptian
                  recollections digressions may be pardonable, I cannot help noticing Mrs.
                     Walker's confectionery establishment, for it is the rendezvous of all
                  the American and English travellers.
               
               A man may as well say he has not been in the Pyramids as not to "Widow
                  Walker's."
               Facing the Esbekia, one of the most delightful public walks in the two
                  hemispheres, her shop, as the English call it, is quite an attraction.
               I dined at her hospitable table one day, and a right jolly time we had of it.
                  First of all "Stoughton and sherry," then soups, fish, flesh, fowl, fruits of
                  every conceivable variety. With the exception of our party, there were not
                  half-a-dozen Americans in the city; of these, two or three are missionaries, and
                  this in a place having 400,000 population. Even the United States Consulate is
                  held by a Greek, a most genial gentlemanlike person, by the way, doing all in his
                  power to make Americans at home.
               To continue my digression a little, I may add that very shortly numbers of
                  Americans will be attracted to Egypt to settle.
               My friend Captain M. informed me that the liberality of the present able, kind,
                  and energetic Viceroy, particularly to Americans, is proverbial, and that many
                  openings in business and trade in Cairo he is desirous of giving to Americans. He
                  has taken a great fancy to them.
            
            
               CXI.
               ABOUT COTTON.
               MY informant told me that the Viceroy was bending all his energies to the proper
                  cultivation of cotton: Egypt being a country of vast agricultural capabilities,
                  foremost among its exportable products is the staple referred to. It is not
                  generally known that the Egyptian cotton is of a very high grade.
               In all European markets the Sea Island cotton of the United States stands first,
                  the next in value is the Egyptian, the lowest is the Upland of the
                  Southern States; the latter is hardly ever at more than half the price of either
                  of the two former in all foreign markets.
               There is no limit, he says, to the supply that Egypt can furnish, so far as
                  breadth of suitable land is concerned. The only difficulty is the inadequate
                  supply of laborers.
               These, it struck me, could be readily and cheaply obtained from India.
               It appears that His Highness the Viceroy is quite alive to the permanent
                  importance of this matter, and will soon furnish large supplies.
               A few months before my arrival he had imported from Georgia a quantity of the Sea
                  Island seed, and it has produced a cotton fully equal to the best Georgia.
               But I had almost forgotten that we had had our breakfast prior to starting for the
                  world-renowned Pyramids.
               Let us mount our donkeys (mine began to kick immediately) and be off. Some eight
                  or ten are before the hotel-door: one for myself, one for old Hassan, my Arab
                  servant, a regular wag by the way, full of all manner of deviltry and fun, whom I
                  may honor perhaps by again mentioning; another "moak" for my fat friend the
                  Captain, and one for his servant; another for an American lady, and her attendant;
                  making one of the merriest cavalcades that ever turned face pyramid-ward.
               I must not fail to notice the donkey of the trip, a sort of miniature
                  hotel, in the matter of refreshments, with a full pannier on each side.
               What was in these panniers, or rather what was not in
                  them, it would be difficult to tell.
               If you wish to know them, the exclamation "Walker" will better answer the
                  query.
               A three hours' ride brought us to the base of the principal pyramid, and what a
                  sight greeted me! I cannot find language to convey the faintest idea of the
                  emotions it enkindled; they were not simply those of wonder but of awe. How into
                  perfect nothingness dwindled every monument or pillar I had seen. I cannot imagine
                     why these huge monuments were built. Most people, I believe, have
                  a theory upon the subject; but it seems to me their origin as to time,
                  circumstance, and cause, is utterly unknown.
               The one I ascended was about 490 feet high. I reached the top by the aid of steps,
                  about four feet apart; it was toilsome and somewhat dangerous, and the heat very
                  great, but my guide took good care of me, and, gaining the top, desired me to look at our party left at the base.
                  When lo! and behold! moving to and fro on the sand were half-a-dozen black specks,
                  more like insects than human beings; and when my readers are informed that the
                     base of this pyramid covered over twelve acres of land, standing
                  upon a piece of ground much larger than the Park in New York, they will better,
                  perhaps, appreciate the view I obtained upon reaching the summit.
               It would be difficult for me to say, exactly, what I saw, for it appeared to me,
                  above and below, to be one great sheet of sky and barren land; and from this dizzy
                  altitude, as I looked on the two sister pyramids in the distance, the pointed
                  minarets of the mosques at Cairo, I thought of those who, four thousand years ago,
                  were standing on this same spot, and, like myself, speculating as to the origin of
                  this stupendous pile, or the purposes for which it was erected.
               Leaving the gates of Cairo, the pyramids were perpetually in sight; and as I stood
                  on a high mountainous range, right on the edge of the desert, without any very
                  particular thing with which to compare them, the great size of the pyramids did
                  not so much strike me; but the nearer I reached them, the more their gigantic
                  proportions grew upon me, until approaching the first layer of stones, I began to
                  appreciate my own liliputian dimensions.
               It took me about half an hour to get to the top. There are over 200 tiers of stone
                  from one to four feet in height. A great part of the ascent was accomplished by me
                  on my knees, assisted greatly by my two Arab guides.
               I said just now it would be difficult for me to describe precisely what I saw,
                  upon reaching this great altitude; but no person can stand at the top of this vast
                  pyramid and gaze upon the dark mountains bordering the Arabian desert, upon the
                  ancient cities of the Pharaohs, with their minarets, mosques, and domes, all
                  glowing in the light of a burning sun, the beautiful valley of the Nile, the river
                  of Egypt rolling at his feet, the range of pyramids and tombs extending along the
                  edges of the desert to the ruined city of Memphis, and the eternal and boundless
                  sands of Africa, without receiving impressions never to be effaced.
               It is said that the great pyramid contains six millions of cubic feet of stone,
                  and that one hundred thousand men were employed twenty years in building it.
            
            
               CXII.
               ALEXANDRIA.
               ON the following day I left for Alexandria, and stopped at the Hotel d'Europe-a
                  capital hostelry, and where I was kindly attended to; the landlord obliging, the
                  table a capital one, and the charges moderate.
               Having obtained, through the Consul, the necessary order, I went to the Pasha's
                  palace, taking off my shoes before I crossed the threshold. Chaste and costly
                  ornaments, floor inlaid with rosewood, pearl, and ebony; marble, highly polished
                  and variegated; rooms fitted up with every luxury; baths of perfumed water, and
                  bedsteads of solid silver, dazzle, bewilder, and astonish you. And really, in many
                  respects, in and about the city, I found much to interest me.
               The public square, on which the principal government buildings and hotels are
                  situated, hardly has its superior in any city of its size in the world.
               At evening it has very great attractions, especially when a gorgeous eastern full
                  moon lights it up, and when its numerous promenaders bask in its light, listening
                  to the capital band furnished by the Viceroy.
               The environs of the town are singularly beautiful. Nowhere in the East did I see
                  finer drives; the inhabitants seem to prize them, and the "turnouts" upon the road
                  about sunset are of the best description; usually well built French barouches,
                  drawn by symmetrical Arabian horses. The latter have not been over-praised, they
                  cannot be; of the purest Arab blood, they seem admirably broken in, if broken in
                  they can be said to be, for the Arab horse is by nature docile.
               The Arabs treat their horses even more tenderly than they do their children. It is
                  thought by many that the art which Mr. Rarey so eminently possesses is well known
                     to the Egyptians; indeed, some think
                  he received the idea from them.
               I think Alexandria is, beyond doubt, destined speedily to become a commercial port
                  of the first rank. The present Viceroy, it would seem, sees its importance, and is
                  doing wonders in the premises.
               The modern invention of the screw-steamer, as a means of propulsion, will
                  materially aid him. The long and frequent calms in the Mediterranean render
                  sailing vessels of comparatively little use, except for carrying coals and heavy
                  goods thither, or in taking back grain; all lighter merchandise is carried by the
                  screw-steamers.
               While on this subject, and to wind up my Egyptian "notes," I may add that I was
                  much interested in an invention which my American friend, Captain M., thinks he
                  has made. It is that of a "concentrated fuel." He reasons thus, and I
                  think with a good deal of plausibility.
               Take a ton of ordinary bituminous coal, for example, and put it under the boiler;
                     what becomes of this ton of coal? A very considerable percentage,
                  as everybody knows, escapes from the chimney in the form of smoke; another very
                  considerable percentage is thrown overboard in the form of what they call
                  "slag."
               My friend referred to, proposes to divest the coal of these two useless elements
                     before putting it on board ship; or, in other words, to "coke it"
                  on shore. He expects to charge this coke with two important elements which are
                  supporters of combustion; he will then reduce the mixture to a powder by proper
                  machinery, then by powerful pressure to make it into compact, solid cubes of any
                  desired size or weight. The experiments he has made, he assures me, are highly
                  gratifying, and he is confident that one ton measurement of this fuel will
                     do the work of four tons of ordinary bituminous coal!
               
               The Viceroy is very desirous of creating a larger trade with the United States,
                  and I was informed that his sympathies are most decidedly with America.
               As I have before said he has had steam vessels-of-war built here; and he runs
                  American cars on his railways.
               It might be said that he could procure what he wants in the way of manufactures
                  from England and France. But he does not like England. He has the sagacity to
                  perceive that English influence has political as well as commercial objects in
                  view; at least he thinks so; which, for all practical consequences,
                  is the same thing. He is less jealous of the French, but as America can have no
                  possible interest to serve beyond that which is purely commercial, he patronizes
                  anything American.
               Speaking of American manufactures, the Viceroy is just about to have under his
                  consideration the introduction of American locomotive engines for his railway.
               He also will turn his attention to American clothing for his army and navy. All
                  these he now procures from England and France; but it is confidently believed that
                  he can more cheaply and satisfactorily supply himself from America. An intelligent
                  American, who has long resided there, is now in the United States, making the
                  necessary examination; he will soon return thither, and large orders for the above
                  will unquestionably be the result.
               To dwell for a moment on the American locomotive engines. In many of the foreign
                  countries, indeed in all where they have been tried, they are much preferred to
                  the English. A most thorough comparative trial of them was not long since made on
                  the Southern Railway of Chili, and the result was thus briefly summed up by the
                  committee.
               "The trial resulted in the superiority of the American Rogers' Locomotives of both
                  classes, although the calculated power of the English engines was in each class
                  twelve per cent, the greatest as to tractive power; and more as to fire surface
                  and adhesion."
               The time is near when American locomotives will take the place of all others in
                  the Egyptian railways.
               On the 20th of January I left Alexandria by steamship "Colombo," for Southampton;
                  on the 25th reached Malta; on the 28th, Gibraltar.
               Went on shore, made some purchases, and saw numbers of monkeys, scrambling up the
                  rock.
               Feb. 3.-Landed at Southampton, and put up at the Castle Inn-weather cold, rainy,
                  and unpleasant.
            
            
               
               CXIII.
               SOUTHAMPTON.
               ONCE again in England! After the exciting scenes I had gone through in India and
                  elsewhere, the melancholy quiet, the gloomy and dismal appearance of everything in
                  this sober-looking old town, was particularly noticeable.
               A walk up High street, especially on a wet day, will be sure to give you the
                  blues, and as it rains here six days out of the seven, the chances are, that you
                  will be in that blissful state of feeling pretty much all the while.
               It was in this town that I, by the advice and assistance of my agent, proposed to
                  give my initiatory entertainment, having sent on in advance from Calcutta an
                  advertisement to that effect.
               Accordingly the walls were posted, and the papers attended to, and the Royal
                  Victoria Rooms taken for Friday evening, Feb. 12, 1858.
               I was standing in High street admiring the style of bill my printer had treated me
                  to, when lo and behold toy next door neighbors on the wall were Mr. and Mrs.
                  Barney Williams, whom I had not seen since they left California in 1855, where by
                  the way they played a most brilliant series of engagements, pocketing the neat
                  little sum of $30,000 by the trip. Their talented relations, Mr. and Mrs.
                  Florence, have been likewise wonderfully successful in England and in America, and
                  were they to visit Australia and California, a rich reward, I think, would await
                  them.
               The rain (as usual) came down furiously, and consequently the people did not-but
                  what with "complimentaries, distributed with a liberal hand by my indefatigable
                  agent, H. C--, and a very descent sprinkling of paying persons-there was quite a
                  respectable gathering of the "natives."
               Now, the reader must be informed that we were both (myself and agent) sanguine,
                  not only as to the attractiveness, but of the perfect success of at least a
                  portion of the programme, with an English audience, the part relating to the
                  recent mutinies in India. In this, as the sequel proved, we both
                  committed an error, for the people appeared to care little about what had or had
                  not occurred in India, or, as I thought the most likely, were entirely ignorant of
                  there being such a country!
               The "varied and interesting" entertainment (as the bills said) went off very well;
                  the audience, though not particularly demonstrative, were appreciative and kind,
                  and though the receipts did not warrant my engaging the Hall for several weeks,
                  the performances elicited a handsome notice in the journals of the next day.
               Taking a run over to Salisbury and Winchester, we gave a night at the Town Hall,
                  in the latter fine old city, where I was honored by the patronage and presence of
                  the Mayor thereof, a Mr. J. Dowling, who kept a haberdasher's shop, on the main
                  street I had also sent complimentary tickets to the boys of Winchester School, who
                  honored me with their company, and seemed greatly pleased.
               After visiting the magnificent old cathedral, we took the train for London,
                  arriving there once again in my native city, on Saturday the 13th February, where,
                  having written to my old landlady, Mrs. Scoone, for apartments, I found myself
                  comfortably located at 30 Old Bond street.
            
            
               CXIV.
               LONDON ONCE AGAIN.
               AS the principal object of my visiting the metropolis upon the present occasion,
                  was the introduction of my "Entertainment" and myself to the great big "public," I
                  shall give my experience of some of the troubles, trials, and vexations, connected
                  therewith.
               First then, it is almost impossible for a stranger, male or female,
                  rich or poor, to obtain a hearing-they are looked upon with suspicion and
                  distrust. It is nothing to have received the stamp of approval from the highest in
                  the land, in all portions of the globe,-they affect to know nothing about you in
                     London!-you know! It is a fearful ful ordeal to pass through-but a "hit" once made
                  here, a fortune is as certainly within your grasp as that the Sun shines in the
                  heavens.
               I came well introduced-and had been twice favored by being elected an
                  honorary member of the "Garrick Club,"-had met socially the Editors of some of the
                  leading Journals, and finally was taken in "hand" by one-whom they call "the
                  Queen's head man," the well known Mr. John Mitchell, of the Royal Library, 33 Old
                  Bond street-who directing his factotum-the good-hearted and erratic "John Nimmo,"
                  to superintend the "bringing of me out"-I proceeded to prepare myself to "face the
                  music."
               "Hanover Square Rooms" had been selected for the debut, and Monday, the 8th of March, the night of the
                  performance.
               Tickets had been most liberally scattered-not only to the Press, but had been sent
                  by Mr. Mitchell to all the leading literary men in London.
            
            
               CXV.
               THE EVENT, AND WHAT OCCURRED.
               AS I left my lodgings in Old Bond street, about half-past seven, it (as usual)
                  began to rain!
               Upon reaching the private door of the "Rooms," the people were going in crowds,
                  cabs and carriages lined the streets, and it was pretty evident that the place
                  would be crowded to suffocation-and so it was! Too many tickets had been issued
                  for the size of the room, and the noise, hubbub, and confusion were intense.
               At a few minutes past eight, I went upon the platform, and commenced my
                  "Introductory Address"-but I found it perfectly useless to proceed-as my voice was
                  completely drowned in the storm of voices, the mingled screams of fainting women,
                  shouting of the men, and crying of children! I stood for a minute or so, and
                  placidly surveyed the scene-wondering the cause-and in a perfect quandary as to
                  what to do; the noise continued-and amid cries of "order," "shame," "hisses," "put
                  'em out," "sit down," "we've got no seats," "humbug," "can't see," "can't hear,"
                  and the like, I walked off! fully determined on not appearing till the audience
                  were quiet.
               I waited perhaps ten minutes-when on I went-the noise still continuing-but upon my
                  going to the piano, to sing my first song, it gradually subsided.
               Now this in itself was enough to disturb and ruffle one, but as I proceeded with
                  my motley programme-jumping from the comic to the serious-without the slightest
                  continuity or connexion-I found out, and felt the mistake I had made,
                  particularly in presenting the terrible account of the revolt in India, and the
                  blowing away from the guns I and when my Sepoy servant-a real live native, in
                  Indian costume, handed round the weapon to the audience, used by an English lady
                  at Cawnpore in defending herself from the attacks of the mutineers, the effect
                  produced was anything but pleasing-to myself or my audience. My entertainment
                  concluded with the Charge of the Light Brigade, which was most enthusiastically
                  received, and right glad was I when it was all over!
               
                   
               
               The papers the next day, as a general thing, were favorable, some highly
                  complimentary-and I was strongly advised to repeat the performance, making some
                  slight alterations in the programme; but I had accomplished my object, viz.
                  appearing in the great metropolis before an English audience alone and unassisted-and although
                  in a pecuniary point of view I was not much benefited, I had gained a little
                  experience as to the likes, dislikes, and requirements of a London audience.
               As an illustration of the difficulty of making an impression, i.e. a
                  favorable one, or what they call a "palpable hit" in London, and of the immense
                  expense attending a proper introduction to a metropolitan audience, I will mention
                  that in many instances hundreds of pounds have been sunk, houses, night after
                  night, packed with free tickets and orders, and every conceivable plan resorted
                  to, in order to gain the good-will of the people.
               Albert Smith's first attempt as a "Lecturer" in his "Overland Mail" was a dead
                  failure-but nothing daunted, he went at it again, and achieved success, fame, and
                  fortune by his "Mont Blanc."
               Mr. Henry Russell, perhaps, is the most remarkable instance of the success of a
                  Monologue entertainment-he having retired some years since on a fortune of 60,000.
                  This gentleman strongly advised me to remain in London, stating from what he had
                  seen and heard of my first appearance, the impression I had made was
                  favorable-that I should be patient, that I could remain profitably and permanently
                  in London for months.
               But I was restless, did not care about losing any more money, was anxious to get
                  back to dear old New York, and make a running tour through the States, and settle
                  quietly down.
               In connexion with this matter, I shall trouble the reader with an extract from a
                  very kind letter received by me while in London, from a gentleman of position and
                  experience, which will be found somewhat germane to the subject.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              PARK ROAD, REGENT'S PARK, March 15, 1858.
                               
                                 STEPHEN C. MASSETT, ESQ., 
                              
                           
                           MY DEAR SIR:-Since I last addressed you, that mighty engine, the
                              press, has pronounced on the merits of your debut at the Hanover
                              Square Rooms. The opinions are certainly various-though some are
                              highly complimentary, such as the "Morning Chronicle," the "Morning
                              Advertiser" "Standard," "Lloyd's Weekly," the "Era," and even the
                              "Times," though suggestive, and pointing out the non-adaptability of
                              your selections to a London audience-is as a whole favorable-as it
                              lauds your genius.
                           For myself, I discovered that you had not taken into account the true
                              character, idiosyncrasies, peculiarities, and humor, of a promiscuous
                              English audience, which is so phlegmatic and concentrative that it is
                              a herculean task to move them, and when moved to change the current of
                              their bent. It was in this you failed; to the discriminating yours was
                              ail intellectual treat of a high order-you demonstrated the rare
                              genius of portraying the deepest pathos, in juxtaposition to the
                              extravagantly grotesque. To the mercurial American, Australian,
                              Anglo-Englishman, or Dutchman, these sudden undulations-these touches
                              of humanity-in contrast to the graphic delineations of the
                              incongruous-would have been like carbonic acid on wine of life-they
                              would have relished the draught with zest; not so with cold apathetic
                              John Bull-a void these powerful antagonisms, and success is your
                              own!
                           "Nothing could excel your various recitations. So great, indeed, was
                              the effect produced; that several ladies were moved to tears; but to
                              my chagrin, on the next instant you introduced a burlesque
                              representation-though true to life, still not in taste. The mind
                              cannot tolerate such a sudden revulsion-the antithesis is
                              repulsive."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CXVI.
               MR. SHIRLEY BROOKS.
               THIS gentleman, so well known and esteemed in England and in this country as a
                  delightful writer, as well as one of the bright ornaments of the Illustrated News
                  and of Punch, I had the pleasure of meeting upon one or two occasions, and was by
                  him very cordially received. In a letter from him, acknowledging one I brought him
                  from Calcutta, he thus writes-
               
               "If there is any advice or assistance that I can give you towards promoting your
                  object here, I need not say it is most heartily at your service.
               "I have received the highest accounts of your talents, and indeed genius, and it
                  would appear to me that an Entertainment, written to the present
                     requirements of London audiences, is all that you require to secure the
                  best possible of positions."
               So much for my first and last appearance in the good old city of London.
               Haying taken farewell of the dear public, I turned my attention, for the few weeks
                  I remained in England, to sight-seeing and amusements generally.
            
            
               CXVII.
               THE DERBY DAY.
               ON the 19th of May, I started with my friend H. C. for the Derby races. We went
                  democratically, and by rail. Such a sight, in point of numbers, I had never
                  witnessed, excepting on the Esplanade at Bombay. There were over 100,000 persons
                  on the ground, of all sizes, ages, sexes, and degrees. From my lofty and somewhat
                  rickety seat on the Grand Stand, that cost me a guinea, my companion pointed out
                  to me some of the celebrities. I distinctly saw Lord Derby, standing by the head
                  of his horse, patting him, and carefully seeing that he was properly attended
                  to-(Toxophylite, I think the name was),-while Sir Joseph Hawley led his winning
                  horse Beadsman, evidently satisfied that he had made all he could on
                  that day! I was informed that he had won over 50,000! Dukes, lords, baronets, and
                  knights, played at single-stick with costermongers, jugglers, pie-men, and Sweeps;
                  for all is fair on the Derby day. Thimble-riggers and "little joker" men passed
                  the time o' day with a learned judge or a fashionable marquis; while in the snowy
                  hand of a lady, a ham sandwich was invitingly clutched, preparatory to swallowing
                  a glass of sparkling ale, which a distinguished member of parliament was drawing
                  ing from a beer barrel on the top of a drag or four-in-hand. Patient-looking
                  donkeys stood before huge wagons, containing miniature theatres with a stove pipe
                  running through the roof; while a small man with a big drum, and a fat woman with
                  a clinking triangle, on the portable step-ladder, invited the people into the
                  show. Every imaginable style of vehicle was on the field, and all conditions of
                  persons represented, and exchanging with each other good-natured nods. The dust
                  kicked up on the return to town was something fearful, and the sight one to be
                  remembered. Pell-mell went everybody and everything-dog carts, drags, broughams,
                  gigs, cabs, hansoms, four-in-hands, spring carts of all sizes and shapes,
                  carriages, close and open, filled with shouting men, women, and children, chased
                  or stumbled against each other, while friendly recognitions, in the shape of a
                  well-picked knuckle of lamb, a cold potato, or a stale loaf, with well-directed
                  aim, from nobody knows where, caught you on the "top knot," or fell into the lap
                  of a Belgravia beauty, unnoticed, and only laughed at; for all is fair on the
                  Derby day.

               THE GARRICK CLUB.
               ON the 17th of April, I was elected a second time an honorary member of this
                  delightful association, and received the following note informing me of the
                  fact:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Garrick Club, 17 April, 1858.
                           
                           SIR:-I have the honor, by the direction of the Committee, to inform
                              you that they have this day had the pleasure of electing you an
                              honorary member of the Garrick Club.
                           
                              Your most obedient servant,
                              S. C. MASSETT, ESQ.
                              ALEX. POLAND, Secy.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               This is one of the pet clubs of London, and in point of comfort, completeness of
                  its internal arrangements, luxuriousness of the living, the regularity, order and
                     system that prevail-to say nothing
                  of the delightful people that you meet with in close communion, and the generous
                  welcome you receive, renders it one of the favorite places of resort for those who
                  are fortunate enough to be elected a member.
               The smoking-room is quite an institution of its kind. Over the door, in gold
                  lettering, is a notice, something like the following: 
                     "This room is exclusively intended for members of this club, on no pretence
                        whatever are strangers, admitted."
                  
               
               My good friend, Mr. Lyster O'B., had informed me, that this did not apply to me,
                  and that I should feel myself as much a member as any one of their number; and
                  that in this room all the fun and jollity took place.
               I had the pleasure of being presented, among others, to the President thereof,
                  Lord Tenterden, who in the warmest and most genial manner welcomed me, and from
                  whom, since my return to America, I have received a very kind note, in which his
                  lordship remarks:
               "Should you again visit England it will give me sincere pleasure to renew our
                  acquaintance-we propose to build a large house, and upon some future occasion will
                  rejoice to bid you welcome to our new home, and to old friends."
               Some of the most delightful hours were passed at this club. I met Thackeray once
                  or twice, the first time in 1858, at the Fielding, immediately after his return
                  from America, where he had given with great success his Lectures upon the
                  Georges.
               During a brief conversation with him about San Francisco, he turned to me and
                  said, "Who is the funny man of California?"-I replied that there were a great many
                  funny men-that I did not know exactly to whom he referred. Why, replied Mr. T.,
                  the man who wrote those astronomical burlesque sketches in the Knickerbocker
                  Magazine. I knew then that he referred to the late Lieut. Derby. I thought the
                  question, coming from one who is at times so cynical, something of a compliment
                  for the late Mr. John Phnix Squibob.
            
            

               CXX.
               CHARLES DICKENS'S FIRST READING IN LONDON.
               ON Thursday evening April 15, 1858, at St. Martin's Hall, Mr. Charles Dickens
                  commenced for the first time in public his "Readings."
               He had been advertised for some weeks beforehand, in the principal Journals of the
                  day, and all the reserved seats had been taken.
               I went with some friends at least an hour before it commenced, and had the
                  greatest difficulty in elbowing my way into the room.
               Streets fairly blocked up with carriages, men, women and children, and the
                  greatest confusion prevailed.
               Precisely at eight, preceded by Mr. Arthur Smith, Mr. Dickens stepped on the
                  platform. It was the first time that I had seen him, and I certainly should not
                  have recognised any resemblance to the plaster busts, with the long flowing curly
                  hair, round and beardless chin, that were so common here twenty years ago.
               Mr. Dickens was at this date about forty-six. His hair was of an iron grey color,
                  he wore a pretty full beard, a sort of goatee; he had on a very white waistcoat,
                  and a very large bouquet attached to the left lappel of a black dress coat. After
                  adjusting the lamps on either side of him, and not once looking at the audience,
                  or in the slightest degree acknowledging the storm of applause with which upon his
                  entrance he was greeted-and opening a large book, which appeared to me to be
                  printed on one side of the leaf, in very large type, and carrying in his hand an
                  ivory paper knife, with which he tapped the page of his book-and first moistening
                  his lips with the inevitable tumbler, of water, he commenced to read his
                  celebrated Christmas Carol.
               Dickens, without any exception, is the finest "reader" I have ever heard; there is
                  nothing of the stereotyped gesticulation, intonation, or attitudinizing of your
                  professed elocutionist-there is no straining for effect-it is natural, quiet, straightforward, and from the
                  individuality with which each character is invested, it becomes intensely
                  interesting as the story proceeds. His voice is resonant and unctuous, and
                  wonderfully sympathetic, and I was informed that in private he is esteemed to be
                  one of the finest of actors.
               Laughter and sobbings alternately rewarded his efforts, and when you take into
                  consideration that there were over 400 in the house, it will be perceived that the
                  whole affair must have been to him highly satisfactory.
               Since that time, as the public is aware, Mr. Dickens has continued with the most
                  unbounded success, his "Readings," and it is said he easily realizes 10,000 a year
                  by this single effort.

               THE SHAKSPEARE DINNER AT THE GARRICK CLUB.
               THIS was one of the most delightful reunions I was present at in London; none but
                  members of the Club were admitted, and I think about three hundred sat down to
                  dinner. Mr. Charles Kean was in the chair, and made a capital speech; Dickens, I
                  was sorry to see, left early, and did not respond, as he was expected, to the
                  toast of "Literature and the Arts"-he had a previous engagement, it appeared, and
                  slipped away unobserved. I had heard so much of the cleverness of his off-hand
                  speeches, that I regretted very much his leaving. Sir Charles Taylor, in
                  introducing, or rather calling upon Mr. Thackeray to respond, brought the author
                  of "Pendennis" on the floor, who, first adjusting his spectacles, and placing his
                  right arm in his ponderous waistcoat, replied somewhat peevishly at first, but at
                  length warmed up-and drew a beautiful little sketch of an imaginary conversation
                  that the different pictures hanging on the walls of the dining-room of the old
                  Garrick, were having together, and wondering among themselves in their lonely
                  apartment, what the absent members were talking about, and doing. It was
                  excessively graphic and amusing.

               This speech, and Mr. Kean's, were the principal efforts of the night.

               HANGING AT THE OLD BAILEY.
               I HAPPENED to be in London on Monday, 26th of April, 1858, the day of the
                  execution of a young Italian, named Giovani Lani, who had been tried and convicted
                  of the murder of a female in the Haymarket. The affair created quite a sensation
                  at the time, and though the offence was a very aggravated one, and the prisoner
                  himself had fully confessed his guilt, still from his extreme youth, only
                  nineteen, and the fact of his being a foreigner, and unable to speak or understand
                  English, he excited a good deal of sympathy.
               Dining the day previous with a friend who informed me that he knew the method of
                  obtaining two good seats for five shillings each, and that it was his intention to
                  be present, we, on the night before, took a cab to Newgate street, and at the
                  small tavern immediately opposite the jail, on the second floor, we secured two
                  "chairs."
               Upon some occasions, fabulous sums are paid for a good "view;" ten, fifteen, and
                  twenty pounds, have been freely given.
               I was informed that the floor above me had been taken by Lord --, for five pounds,
                  and that his Lordship was then up-stairs, with some boon companions, passing the
                  night in song and merriment.
               Wishing to avoid the crowd as much as possible, we were on the ground at the early
                  hour of four, but even then the streets were filled with people, and at the
                  door-steps of the houses were seated, men, women, and even children, some eating
                  and drinking, having passed the night in the open air, to be in readiness for the
                  event.
               As daylight appeared, the excitement in the street below became more and more
                  intense, and about half-past seven, one mass of human beings jammed together so
                  tightly that ingress or egress seemed
                  impossible, swaying to and fro like the heaving of the sea, whilst the hubbub,
                  noise, and din of voices arising from this heterogeneous concourse of people,
                  really resembled its roaring-as the first stroke of the big clock of old St.
                  Sepulchre's church fell upon the ear, announcing the hour of eight, it seemed to
                  act like an electric shock upon the multitude:-the sight beggars description: the
                  roofs of the houses swarmed with human beings in the distance; from the railings
                  of St. Sepulchre to the corner of Newgate, and Fleet street, it was one moving
                  mass of humanity; and from this teemful and excited mob, there rose a yell so
                  demoniacal and appalling that the lookers-on from the windows seemed to shrink
                  from the hearing of it, while the clock was pealing its slow and solemn dirge-and
                  the last note-the hour of eight-had died upon the ear, the raving, tearing,
                  crushing, and heaving to and fro of the multitude, resembled more the ocean, when
                  lashed by the ravings of a storm, than anything else I know of;-when suddenly the
                  head of the culprit appeared upon the black platform, accompanied by the Sheriffs
                  of London, the clergyman, and Calcraft, the executioner,-the yelling, tearing, and
                  shouting ceased, and saving and excepting a few cries of "hate off"-"that's
                  him"-and the like-all was comparatively still.
               The preliminaries over-the rope was placed around his neck-the black cap put upon
                  hid head, covering his face-the rope was cut-and the body dangled in the air-then
                  ere the spirit had fled, arose the shoutings, hootings, and yellings of a thousand
                  voices-some crying out "'Ere's the last speech and confession of Giovani Lani,
                  hung just now," "ony a 'a-penny"-in half an hour the crowd had dispersed, and I
                  and my companion wended our way homeward, heartily sick, and weary of the
                  disgusting scenes and incidents attending an execution at the "Old Bailey." As we
                  left the Tavern, the landlord stepping up to me said: "Here's a new riddle just
                  come out, Sir"-Vy is Calcraft, the Hexecutioner, like the Prince 'o Vales? Cos he
                  went to Kill Lani-(Killarney!)
               The following verses accompanied his "last dying speech and confession," and were
                  sold for a halfpenny.

               
                  My victim was, which I have found,
                  A married woman on the town,
                  The Hay market she rambled round;
                  It was there I did her meet.
                  She had, it seems, one night a dream,
                  Which often caused her grief and pain;
                  She told it o'er, and o'er again,
                  She always thought she would be slain,
                  Alas! it was too true.
               
               
                  Then I on board a ship was found,
                  That was to Monte Video bound,
                  To Greenhithe she had sailed down,
                  The Sea was calm and clear,
                  I out of sight, thought all was right,
                  But oh, alas! I was deceived,
                  The truth I scarcely could believe,
                  On board when justice captured me,
                  A cruel murderer base.
               
               
                  That barbarous cruel deed I done,
                  Tho' young in years my time has come,
                  Oh! pity your unhappy son,
                  My loving parents dear,
                  I'm doomed to go to the grave below,
                  Giovanni Lani, is my name,
                  In sorrow, wretchedness and shame,
                  I do confess I am to blame,
                  She never injured me.
               
               
                  Young men, a warning take by me,
                  Behold me trembling on a tree,
                  Think what must my feelings be,
                  In vigor, youth and bloom,
                  A sad young man, in a foreign land,
                  I wish I never had been born;
                  To die a dreadful death of scorn,
                  My glass is run and now forlorn,
                  I hasten to the tomb.
               
               
                  At the West End of London town,
                  Where pretty maidens ramble round,
                  One night I Heloise Thaubin found,
                  And she looked fair and gay,
                  I with her did steer, to a brothel near,
                  That night she looked in health and bloom,
                  She took me to the fatal room,
                  Where soon I sent her to the tomb,
                  'Twas there I did her slay.
               
               
               
                  I on a foreign land must die,
                  Look down with pity from on high,
                  Alas! no friend or kindred nigh,
                  My wretched end to see,
                  Unhappy man, in a foreign land,
                  My days must end upon a tree,
                  Oh! how could I so cruel be,
                  A female who never injured me,
                  Inhumanly I stayed.
               
               
                  I strangled her, you may suppose,
                  I robbed her of her watch and clothes,
                  Then from the fatal spot did go,
                  Thinking that I was clear,
                  God's all-seeing eye, was hovering nigh,
                  Taken I was doomed to be,
                  And I from justice could not flee,
                  They brought me to the fatal tree,
                  For I'm condemned to die.
               
            
            
               CXXIII.
               A VISIT to DOCTORS' COMMONS, LONDON, AND TO THE SURROGATE'S OFFICE,
                  NEW YORK. THE CONTRAST.
               IMMEDIATELY in the rear of St. Paul's Church, up a very narrow court, is the
                  celebrated place for the depository of wills.
               Thither I went one morning from sheer curiosity, to look at the will of a deceased
                  relative, who I thought might have accidentally left me a few shillings.
               Entering a little green baize door, covered all over with brass nails, with an
                  oval piece of glass let into the top panel, I encountered a bald-headed gentleman,
                  seated on a very high three-legged stool, to whom I paid one shilling, for the
                  privilege of looking at the aforesaid will.
               Pointing dismally with a very shaky and rickety looking ink-dyed first finger, to
                  another door, he told me to enter, and keep straight, on until I came to a larger
                  room with a number of desks in it, where I should receive further directions. This
                  I soon found, and I will endeavor to describe what I saw-and what I did.
                  Everything was as silent as the grave-nobody spoke above a whisper-and those who
                  walked stepped on tiptoe from desk to desk, as though some frightful calamity had
                  just happened. Dark, dank, dismal, and gloomy looked everybody, and everything.
                  Shelves covered the walls of the apartment, upon which had rested for
                     hundreds of years ponderous books, all duly labelled, and lettered
                  from A to Z, and I have not the slightest doubt (though I forgot to ask for it),
                  that the will of Adam, Cain, and Abel, or Mr. Noah, if they ever made any, could
                  be found here.
               Approaching the desk of the clark who had charge of the letter
                  "C"-the one I wanted-I gave him the name, and as well as I could remember, the
                  date of my relative's death; and when the reader is informed that I commenced to
                  "go over the C's" at about ten o'clock in the morning, and continued until
                     two in the afternoon, and was told that there were about fifty more
                  books of the same letter and date to look through, my disgust can be imagined, and
                  I gave it up in despair. A man, while I was standing there, actually gave the name
                  of "Brown," which I noticed created a gentle titter among the "Noggs," one of
                  whom, with a shrug of the shoulder, pointed in the direction of the "B's, who
                  evidently seemed desirous of being "Busy" about other things just at that moment.
                  Without exaggeration there were over twenty shelves of "B's,"-think
                  of wading through the begrimed dusty pages of a big book covered with cobwebs, on
                  a hot summer's day, to look for what you cannot find.
               The fittings-up and furniture of this room were of the most antique description,
                  and I should imagine had known no change for at least a century. There were the
                  high old dark mahogany desks, with dangling brass handles and innumerable
                  pigeon-holes, and three-legged stool to match, the top of which, scooped out and
                  well polished by constant use and friction, was only reached by a gymnastic
                  spring, that was particularly ludicrous upon some occasions to witness; old pewter
                  ink-stands, with long quills, and feathers at the end, stuck in 'em, while the
                  remaining paraphernalia might have been supposed to belong to the Bookkeeper in
                  Noah's ark. Through the thick and heavy sashes of the window-frames, with the
                  panes black with dust and smoke, you
                  look into a court-yard, where there is a little scrap of verdure and a small
                  "Fountain;" out of this window an old gentleman was gazing, with both hands stuck
                  into his breeches pocket-very much after the order of Mr. Pickwick-when the
                  following father amusing incident took place. But first, I must inform the reader
                  that all the "Noggs" in this department looked more like very gloomy and retired
                  undertakers, than anything else I know of.
               The old clark, above referred to, was dressed in a seedy suit of
                  black, with very tight-fitting knee-breeches, and gaiters to match, and carried
                  about with him as fine a pair of calves as ever twinkled behind a carriage in
                  Belgravia; as his back was only at first visible, I could simply notice the
                  peculiar cut of the coat, which very much resembled Mr. Toodles's-the tail
                  descending nearly to the heel-and from one of the pockets was hanging, as if to
                  dry, a very uncomfortable-looking handkerchief, of doubtful color his bald head
                  loomed up from the collar of his coat like a moon on the half shell, while
                  sticking out from each side of his top-knot were little streaks of white hair,
                  that-to carry out the simile-might be likened to a couple of flakes of a silver
                  cloud in attendance on the orb of night.
               The letter "H" came under this gentleman's immediate supervision; and as I noticed
                  a man approach him, who had evidently had a drop too mnch, I thought some fun was
                  brewing, and I accordingly remained to see the sport.
               "I wish ter-look-er Mish-er Hansom's will if splesh?"
               "Sir," said the fat old gentleman-placing the palm of his hand on the top of the
                  stool, and the other on the desk, and giving rather a dignified spring he reached
                  the top, securing each leg thereof with his fat calves-"what name did you
                  say?"
               "Misher Hansom's"-very emphatically asperating the "H."
               Directing the applicant to about a dozen shelves, filled with immense books, with
                  "H" stamped on each, he gloomily resumed his own occupation.
               It was amusing to see the man with "a drop too much," standing very unsteadily
                  against the railing, with trembling finger, going up and down column after column,
                  mumbling to himself-

               "Thers-sno-Honsom-ere-died-I-year-eighteenern-nineteen dam fers an-will.
                     Hansom's name-ftaint-Willm Hanson's name-(hic)-Isay"-and with this he
                  pushed the book against the old gentleman's elbow, who, turning sharply round,
                  said very pettishly:-
               "Do you spell it with a 'Hay' or a H?" exasperating the last letter
                  fearfully.
               "Vith a 'Hay,' f-course-didn't I tellr-sho-jst now!"
               Then again directing him to look over the first letter of the
                  alphabet, he cast a dismal look at a series of shelves loaded with books, all
                  marked "A," fist telling the old gentleman, very disrespectfully, that he'd see
                  him d--d first. He wabbled out of the apartment-and now for the contrast.
               I had occasion to look at the will of a once resident of the city of New York, and
                  for that purpose repaired to the office of the Surrogate.
               I simply stated to the clerk the name of the deceased, when-as if it was the only
                  will in existence-he opened a drawer, and handed it to me.
               The "styles" were so opposite, that I thought a relation of the facts might amuse
                  the reader.
            
            
               CXXIV.
               THE HON. MRS. NORTON.
               HAVING received a very pleasant note from this delightful authoress, inviting me
                  to call upon her, I duly presented myself at the appointed hour, at her cosy town
                  residence in Chesterfield Street, May Fair; but let my visit be prefaced by an
                  extract from her polite note:-
               "I assure you I always regret any missed opportunities of making or renewing
                  acquaintance with those who come from the 'far West,' where I have many
                  well-remembered friends."
               Mrs. Norton received me most kindly; and though on the other side of fifty, is still a
                  magnificent-looking woman, with large lustrous black eyes; dark, thick, and
                  luxuriant hair, very slightly tinged with grey; teeth of perfect whiteness and
                  regularity, and a voice extremely musical.
               Her manners are most fascinating, and many were her inquiries of the poets of this
                  country-of Bryant, Long-fellow, Halleck, and Willis, she spoke particularly. While
                  conversing with her, I could not help thinking of the beautiful description of
                  this world-renowned songstress in Willis's poem of the "Lady Jane,"
                  and though written over twenty years ago, is still so faithful a portrait of
                  her.
               This lady will be remembered as one of the three sisters "Sheridan," who, by the
                  unanimous voice of England, popular and aristocratic, have been indisputably
                  pronounced the "three Graces;" they are three women of a degree of beauty seldom
                  seen. The youngest of them, Lady Seymour, was voted by acclamation, "Queen of
                  Beauty," for the "Eglinton Tournament." Lady Dufferin, the other sister, is the
                  wife of Lord Dufferin, and is celebrated for her wit, as the other two for the
                  specialities of beauty and genius.
               Mr. N. P. Willis told me, that the most beautiful woman he ever saw was Mrs.
                     Norton.
               
               Here are the charming verses before referred to:- 
                     
                        She had a low, sweet brow, with fringed lakes
                        Of an unfathom'd darkness couch'd below;
                        And parted on that brow in jetty flakes
                        The raven hair swept back with wavy flow,
                        Rounding a head of such a shape as makes
                        The old Greek marble with the goddess glow.
                        Her nostril's breathing arch might threaten storm-
                        But love lay in her lips, all hush'd and warm.
                     
                     
                        And small teeth, glittering white, and cheek whose red
                        Seem'd Passion, there asleep, in rosy nest:
                        And neck set on as if to bear a head-
                        May be a lily, may be Juno's crest,-
                        So lightly sprang it from its snow-white bed!
                        So proudly rode above the swelling breast!
                        And motion, effortless as stars awaking
                        And melting out, at eve, and morning's breaking;
                     
                     
                        And voice delicious quite, and smile that came
                        Slow to the lips, as 'twere the heart smiled thro':-
                        These charms I've been particular to name,
                        For they are, like an inventory, true,
                        And of themselves were stuff enough for fame;
                        But she so wondrous fair, has genius too,
                        And brilliantly her thread of life is spun-
                        In verse and beauty both, the "Undying One!"
                     
                  
               
            
            
               CXXV.
               LEAVE ENGLAND FOR NEW YORK.
               ON Saturday, 29th May, 1858, I sailed in the steamship Asia, Captain Lott, once
                  again for New York, and arrived after a somewhat dreary and foggy passage, on the
                  10th June, at Jersey City.
               After receiving the congratulations and kind greetings of dear and cherished
                  friends, in this most fascinating city, after my world-rounded voyages, I set to
                  work to prepare myself for a "First Appearance" in the Metropolis of America, in a
                     "Monologue Entertainment."
            
            
               CXXVI.
               A VISIT TO IDLEWILD.
               HAVING received a very pleasant invitation from Mr. N. P. Willis, to pass a few
                  days at his country residence on the banks of the Hudson, I wish briefly to
                  chronicle the event, for two reasons: First, as a slight
                  acknowledgment for the hospitality and kindness with which, by himself and his
                  family, I was treated; and, secondly, I wish to have the pleasure of
                  paying thus publicly a very humble tribute to his genius.
               Some months since, I read in a London Journal, an extract from a Lecture delivered
                  by a well known gentleman man of the
                  Metropolis, in which he was speaking of the relative merits of the writers of the
                  present day.
               He spoke of Mr. Willis as belonging to that class which (he thought) had
                     never been properly appreciated. He did not, neither shall I,
                  offer in this brief sketch, any particular analysis of his writings, either in
                  prose or verse. What I wish to remark is simply this: that I have riot read,
                  neither can I conceive anything finer in the English language, than his scriptural
                  poems; these-and they are some of his earliest efforts-have never been properly
                  estimated, and I was going to say hardly known.
               His "Raising' of Lazarus," the "Leper," and the "Daughter of Nain," entitle him to
                  occupy the highest niche in Fame's poetic temple; and as the eye. runs over the
                  word-painting of these exquisite creatures of his fancy, the picture of the scene,
                  events, and circumstances, is as perfect as if fresh from the hand of the most
                  distinguished limner.
               In Harper's Magazine for January, 1858, is a very pleasantly written sketch,
                  beautifully illustrated with etchings, from the pen and pencil of T. Addison
                  Richards, the artist.
               In reference to the nomenclature of this beautiful spot, Mr. Willis says:
                  "Idlewild belonged to a very valuable farm, but it was a side of it which, from
                  being very little more than a craggy ravine-the bed of a wayward torrent-had
                  always been left in complete wilderness. When I first fell in love with it, and
                  thought of making a home amidst its tangle of mountains, my first inquiry as to
                  its price was met with the disparaging remark, that it was of little value: only
                  an idle wild, of which nothing whatever could be made; and that description of it
                  stuck captivatingly in my memory-'Idlewild, Idlewild' then shall be the name."
            
            

               CXXVII.
               "UNDERCLIFF."
               THIS is the name of the summer dwelling of the genial lyric poet, General George
                  P. Morris, who, for so many years, has been connected with Mr. Willis in the
                  publication of the Home Journal. In the February number of the Art Journal,
                  published in London for 1861, is an exquisite sketch of this charming spot. The
                  writer remarks:
               "It is a substantial edifice of Doric simplicity in style, perfectly embowered
                  when the trees are in full leaf, yet commanding, through vistas, some charming
                  views of the river and the neighboring mountains. Northward, and near it, rises
                  Mount Taurus, with its impending cliff that suggested the name of the poet's
                  country seat. It is the old 'Bull Hill' which, in Irving's exquisite story of
                  'Dolph Heylinger,' 'bellowed back the storm' whose thunders had 'crashed on the
                  Donder Berg, and rolled up the long defile of the Highlands, each headland making
                  a new echo.'"
               A late writer has justly said of "Undercliff:"
               "It is a lovely spot-beautiful in itself, beautiful in its surroundings, and
                  inexpressibly beautiful in the home affections which hallow it, and the graceful
                  and genial hospitality which, without pretence or ostentation, receives the guest,
                  and with heart in the grasp of the hand, and truth in the sparkle of the eye,
                  makes him feel that he is welcome."
               No one connected with the Press of New York has been more considerate,
                  kind-hearted, and generous to musicians, artistes, or actors, than General Morris;
                  and the writer of these lines, who has had the pleasure of an acquaintance with
                  him for many years, trusts he may long live to grace with his ballads the
                  literature of his native land.
               
               It is hard to find a kindlier nature than the nature this gentleman possesses.

               WASHINGTON IRVING
               ON Wednesday, the 11th August, 1858, I went with my friend J. T. B-- to the
                  funeral of Judge Duer, at Trinity Church.
               Washington Irving was one of the pall-bearers, and at the grave, as the mourners
                  were standing over it and looking at the coffin, I had the pleasure of being
                  introduced to Mr. Irving by Judge Daly, of this city.
               I had just time to say that I had recently returned from England, and had brought
                  with me, from his friend Colonel Wildman, of Newstead, a little memento of
                  friendship, when he replied that he should be most happy, at any time, to see me
                  at "Sunnyside."
               Having been on a brief visit to Mr. Louis Gaylord Clark, then editor of the
                  Knickerbocker Magazine, and having stated to him my desire to call upon Mr.
                  Irving, I left his pleasant cottage at Piermont, crossing the Hudson to Tarrytown
                  and Irvington.
               The cottage is most romantically situated, amid a cluster of trees, with the
                  magnificent old Hudson in glorious proximity, and is the very quintessence of
                  quiet and repose.
               In answer to the bell, a servant informed me that Mr. Irving was at home, and,
                  upon taking my card, she returned with the answer that he would see me in the
                  Library.
               He very soon entered, and, extending his hand, greeted me most cordially.
               I had sent him, with the picture that I had brought from Newstead Abbey, a printed
                  sketch of my Wanderings, and he seemed quite desirous of chatting, inquiring
                  particularly about the Sepoy rebellion, a portion of which I had the year before
                  witnessed in India.
               He had taken a great fancy to Hood's ballad "I Remember," and asked me if I had
                  any objection to sing it to him. Of course I readily assented, and, seeing the
                  piano open, was about to commence when I noticed a gentleman apparently much older
                  than himself, with very silvery locks, intently reading a newspaper. I said, "I'm
                  afraid, sir, I shall disturb that gentleman." "Not at all, not at all," said Mr.
                  Irving; "it's my brother Jacob, he's as deaf as a post; if you were to fire off a
                  cannon he'd be none the wiser!" He, and his nicees, to whom I had been presented,
                  seemed much pleased with the song, Mr. Irving remarking at its conclusion that the
                  last verse always made him feel like crying, and that he regarded
                  Hood as one of the most delightful and genial of poets.
               He spoke of the delightful interviews he had with Tom Moore and Sir Walter Scott.
                  George Frederick Cooke was his beau-ideal of an actor. In speaking of the hours he
                  devoted to writing, he said: "I am now on my fifth volume of the Life of
                  Washington, and I hope I shall not 'pop out' before it is finished!"
               I asked him if he had ever met Byron? He replied: "No, it's very strange; but we
                  were always playing 'hide and seek' with each other. On more than one occasion we
                  were to have met at one of Rogers' breakfasts, but there was always a
                  disappointment."
               In speaking of Dickens, and upon my telling him how delighted I was with his
                  "Readings," he said: "I fell in love with Dickens when he wrote the character of
                  'Little Nell,' and could not resist the temptation of writing to him thanking him
                  for the pleasure he had given me. To this letter he was good enough to reply. But
                  upon the publication of his 'American Notes' all my affection for him vanished,
                  and I avoided calling upon him in England, and have never had the desire to read a
                  line that he has since written."
               We spoke of old Kean; he then gave me an imitation of his peculiar
                     whispering on the stage, telling me that it could be heard over
                  the whole house.
               The servant having announced lunch, we proceeded to the breakfast-room, and here,
                  alone with Mr. Irving, I had the pleasure of gratifying a long cherished wish,
                  which was this:
               As a boy I had revelled in the beauties of his "Sketch-Book Book," and my visit to "Stratford upon Avon" was
                  entirely attributable to the delight experienced in reading his exploits at the
                  "Red Lion" Inn; he winds up his sketch thither in the following exquisite
                  sentence, which I had always longed to repeat to him in person. The time had come.
                  I expressed to him what I have now told the reader, when he replied: "It will give
                  me the greatest pleasure to hear it. What can it be-I have forgotten!"
               I then repeated:
               "How would it have cheered the spirit of the youthful bard when wandering forth in
                  disgrace upon a doubtful world he cast back a heavy look upon his paternal home,
                  could he have foreseen that before many years he should return to it covered with
                  renown, that his name should become the boast and glory of his native place, that
                  his ashes should be religiously guarded as its most precious treasure-and that its
                  lessening spire on which his eyes were fixed in tearful contemplation, should one
                  day become the beacon, towering amidst the gentle landscape, to light the literary
                  pilgrim of every nation to his tomb!"
               Mr. Irving held out his hand to me, and with moistened eye, said:
               "It's very kind of you to remember so much of my scribbling-indeed, I had
                  forgotten it."
               In his sketch of Stratford, Mr. Irving remarked:
               "I thought it something to have seen the dust of Shakspeare." I deem
                  it an honor to have sat at the same table, and enjoyed two hours of pleasurable
                  intercourse with Washington Irving.

               MY FIRST CONCERT AT NIBLO'S.
               I HAD now completed my "Entertainment," which I had somewhat changed and
                  remodelled, calling it, "Song and Chit-Chat of Travels in many
                  Lands," and taken the Concert Room at Niblo's for Thursday evening, the 23d
                  of September, 1858.
               The result was a crowded house, the entertainment being an unequivocal success. On
                  the following morning the journals spoke of it in the most complimentary
                  manner.
               I continued to itinerate for the next month or two in Hoboken, Brooklyn, Newark,
                  Philadelphia, Hartford, and finally made my first appearance in the good old city
                  of Boston.

               HENRY W. LONGFELLOW.
               WHO has not heard of the celebrated bookstore of Tick-nor & Fields, in Boston?
                  Well, it was on a pleasant afternoon in October, '58, that in the little back
                  snuggery or "sanctum sanctorum" of the poet-publisher, James T. Fields, I had the
                  pleasure of being presented to the author of "Evangeline." He was most cordial in
                  his greeting, and invited me to call on him at Cambridge the following
                  afternoon.
               At the appointed hour I rang the bell of the old mansion formerly occupied by
                  General Washington (by the way, how many places the "Father of his Country" did
                  occupy, to be sure!), and, upon entering the Library, I found Mr. Longfellow
                  seated.
               The interview was a most delightful one. We had wandered over a good deal of the
                  same ground in France and Italy; I had read his poems to audiences in
                     Australia, California, Oregon, and
                  India, and many little incidents connected therewith were pleasing to him to hear,
                  and doubly so for me to repeat. I had the pleasure, also, of reading to him
                  portions of his "Miles Standish."
               I was charmed and delighted with him. His voice is very musical, and his manner
                  most fascinating; I should imagine him most genial, considerate, and kind in
                  disposition. He very politely invited me to call upon him, upon my return, which I
                  shall most certainly do; and now from this day ever arter I shall think of
                  Higher-water-think of him who wrote the Poim, and how long I've wished to know
                  him-long'd to know so good-a-fellow-long'd to see the Bard of "Standish"-Miles
                  I've travell'd-yes, outlandish countries have I wandered o'er, wandered o'er
                  outlandish countries-seen big bears and little monkeys-monkeys with their tails
                  behind 'em-monkeys upon barrel organs-barrel organs without monkeys-great big
                  Elephants and Camels-Camels on the sands of Egypt have I rode on, and
                  been blown on seas so boisterous and unruly-seas so rough and Horny, truly as my
                  pen in ink I dip, had it not been for the "Building of the Ship" that I was put
                  in, I shouldn't a' been here to write, my delight, on meeting with
                     to-day the author of "Voices of the Night."

               FIRST CONCERT IN BOSTON.
               SATURDAY evening, November 20, 1858, I gave my first "Song and Chit-Chat of
                  Travel," at the Mercantile Library Hall, Boston. The place was crowded to
                  suffocation, and among the audience many of the leading literary, musical, and
                  theatrical lions of the day. The audience were enthusiastic in their applause, and
                  every piece, either serious or comic, appeared to give the most unbounded
                  satisfaction. The Boston Post, on Monday morning, wound up a very lengthy and
                  highly eulogistic article in the following words:
               "It is somewhat difficult to arouse a Boston audience to enthusiasm, particularly
                  when the candidate for public favor is comparatively a stranger, but the effect
                  Mr. Massett produced by his graphic and wonderful recital of Tennyson's 'Charge of
                  the Light Brigade,' and his vivid description of his exciting adventure in British
                  India, produced an effect almost electrical, and satisfied us that he has not only
                  made a lasting impression here, but that his future career throughout the country
                  will be one of complete triumph."
               After this I made a pleasant and profitable trip from York to New Orleans, proving
                  rather more remunerative than my Australian trip.
               I was gone four months. I gave thirty-seven entertainments and jingled $3,784
                  (cash) in my pants' pocket!

               OFF AGAIN TO CALIFORNIA.
               HAVING a desire once again to see San Francisco, after my somewhat strange
                  adventures, and wishing, at the same time, to look after my valuable "real
                  estate," I determined to make a third trip to the land of gold. I therefore, on
                  5th October, 1859, left New York, arriving in San Francisco in twenty-two
                  days.
               Just ten years since I first "pitched my tent" on Clark's Point. The city had
                  improved wonderfully, and I think I cannot better give the reader an idea of its
                  rapid march and magnificence than by an extract from the eloquent oration of
                  Colonel E. J. C. Kewen, of California, before the Society of the "Pioneers:"
               To you, fellow Pioneers, a word of congratulation and I have done.
               This palatial city of San Francisco, with its luxurious mansions, its granite
                  palaces, and its costly marts of commerce, is the glorious fruitage of your
                  adventure. The subdued waters of its
                  bay, the extended lines of its quays, the busy hum of its thoroughfares, the
                  exhibitions every where visible of its taste, its opulence and refinement, are the
                  splendid creations and magnificent testimonials of your enterprise. Scourged as it
                  has been by the devastating flame, retarded by natural obstacles, and at times
                  inundated by swarms of lawless banditti, it has never been diverted from its
                  onward progress, nor ceased to be the monarch wonder of the world. Like a young
                  Titan, it has humbled the rugged wilderness, has upheaved the seated lulls from
                  their foundations, and with a conqueror's step has advanced along the pathway of
                  progress like a prince to the throne of undisputed succession. Its harbor glistens
                  with a forest of masts belonging to the ships of every nation, which have poured
                  and are pouring upon our shores the accumulated riches of the East, and vaster
                  treasures from every clime than ever freighted the galleons of Spain or the
                  argosies of Venice.
               Champollion taught the world to decipher the hieroglyphics on the obelisks, the
                  tombs, and temples of Egypt, but a higher glory was reserved for the Pioneers of
                  the Pacific, by whom was destined the revelation to mankind of its unavailing
                  search of centuries-the western route to the commerce of the Indies and of the
                  islands of the Eastern Archipelago. Coincident with the exhumation of golden
                  treasures from the bleak summits of the Sierras, was the contribution to our shore
                  of the riches of China and Japan, and the remote islands of the Pacific waste of
                  waters. One other acquisition and the glory of San Francisco will have reached its
                  zenith. When the veins and arteries of commercial life shall permeate the broad
                  expanse that separates the Golden Gate from the Atlantic, then will its
                  magnificent destiny proclaim it the commercial metropolis of the world,
                  outrivalling in commerce, in arts, in science, and literature, the renown of
                  antiquity, and the boasted pretensions of modern greatness. If this sublime
                  consummation is defeated freedom will be deprived of its brightest hope, and a
                  crime will be perpetrated against the social and political necessities of humanity
                  more wicked than that which classic fable has punished with the naked rock and the
                  gnawing vulture. Promote this glorious enterprise and the swelling splendors and
                  far-reaching fame of this mighty continent will be imperishable monuments to the
                  memory of the Pioneers of Freedom and Destiny.
               And in connexion with the Great Pacific Railroad, which I trust I may live to see
                  built, the following spirit-stirring lines of Mr. Frank Soul, one of the most
                  gifted writers of California, will be found, I think, interesting: 
                     
                        Hear you not the answer votive?
                        See you not Progression's train?
                        Hear you not the locomotive
                        Thundering along the plain?
                        List! 'tis coming near and nearer,
                        Listen to its piercing scream;
                        Now the whirling wheels sound clearer,
                        Now I hear the hissing steam.
                        Through the air in transport gliding-
                        Heed you not those proud huzzas!
                        Thirty sister States are riding
                        Hither on those rushing cars.
                        Hither, from each struggling nation,
                        Weary exiles gladly roam-
                        Give them here a habitation,
                        Liberty, and friends, and home.
                        O'er the deserts wide and dreary.
                        Through the terrors of "the Horn,"
                        They are coming, brave, though weary,
                        Parents of a world unborn.
                        See, they gather, man and master,
                        Rushing to this western world,
                        Coming, coming, fast and faster,
                        Daring danger, pain, disaster,
                        Seeking honor, health, and gold.
                        See, they come from every nation-
                        See, our temple is begun;
                        See! the men of every station
                        Meet and labor all as one.
                        From the cities, farms and ranches,
                        From the forum's wordy strife,
                        Teeming from life's varied branches,
                        See! the welcome path is rife.
                     
                     
                        Build a temple high and holy,
                        Build a temple to the mind,
                        Broad and permanent, though slowly,
                        Be its elements combined,
                        
                        Where the mighty and the lowly
                        Happiness may seek and find.
                        Beautiful, then, let us build it,
                        Vieing Solomon's of old;
                        Raise its towering roof, and gild it
                        With our hearts' own native gold.
                        Build it strongly, build it here-
                        Temple of the Pieoneer.
                     
                  
               
               Returning once again, I arrived in New York on Christmas Eve-having been absent a
                  little over two months. And now, my kind and considerate reader, if I have
                  succeeded in gaining your attention thus far in my wanderings, I am truly
                  grateful; but I am really inclined to think you will be delighted when I inform
                  you that this somewhat strange and eventful history is drawing to a close. At any
                  rate my peregrinations and adventures stop here. For the present, I have made New
                  York my resting-place, and have, as the saying goes, "settled down."
               I cannot close without offering my heartfelt thanks for the great kindness
                  extended to me by the Press throughout the United States, and various portions of
                  the Old World, in Australia and in India, during my public career. The notices and
                  criticisms of my performances have been genial, generous, and encouraging.
               I desire, also, to say a word to those who enter the field as Lecturers,
                  Concert-Givers, or Performers.
               To insure success, they must be patient and persevering; seeking for sunshihe even
                  when the storm is darkest, and aiming all the while to improve as they
                  progress.
               And now, kind reader! Farewell. You will agree with me that I have indeed been a
                  "rolling-stone," as to the "moss" which I did or did not gather in the region of
                  lucre, that is "neither here nor there."
               I have been through many a golden district, and often supposed I would die a
                  wealthy individual.
               That ambition is not very active at present; but while I desire to win "golden
                  opinions from all sorts of people" I cannot deny that, considering how many rainy
                  days I encountered in the events this book describes, I am warranted in hoping for
                  something to lay up in anticipation of that particular "rainy day" about which
                  everybody talks, and which, I suppose, makes its appearance when our
                     reign of life is about to close!
               If, however, the public desire to know anything of my future peregrinations or
                  "doings" they can be fully enlightened by addressing, post-paid,
                  Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas H. Landon, Post-office, Harlem, New York, or at my
                  Publisher's.
               And now, reader, your hand once more, God bless you!
               I If in the pages, of which this is the last, I have succeeded in affording you
                  amusement, in that result I will find one of the greatest rewards ever bestowed on
                  your friend and well-wisher
               
                   
               
               
                  THE AUTHOR.
               
            
            THE END.
