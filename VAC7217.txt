               CHAPTER I. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "The roar of waters!-from the headlong height 
                           Velino cleaves the wave-worn precipice; 
                           The fall of waters! rapid as the light 
                           The flashing mass foams shaking the abyss; 
                           The hell of waters! where they howl and hiss, 
                           And boil in endless torture; while the sweat 
                           Of their great agony, wrung out from this 
                           Their Phlegethon, curls round the rocks of jet 
                           That gird the gulf around, in pitiless horror set." 
                        
                      
                     BYRON. 
                   
                
               VISIT NIAGARA in mid-winter! Such an idea had never before floated through my brain, in its most whimsical moods. It was, however, a fancy that would not be rejected. It grew upon me. It became a passion-strong and uncontrollable. There was no reasoning with it. Go I must. I would see the Falls in winter: I longed to hear chanted in that tremendous chorus, one of the great Anthems of Nature, 
                     "O ye Ice and Snow! bless ye the Lord: praise Him, and magnify Him for ever."
                   Yes, though frost-bearded January was sweeping over the land, hushing to stillness every roaring river and noisy stream with his icy breath, the great Niagara he could not chain or silence. I would look upon the face of one who thundered on in unceasing defiance of his power. 
               Two days after the suggestion, I stood, for the first time in winter, looking with wondering eyes upon this great Sphinx of Nature, trying in vain to read her riddle. I lingered long, and observed and studied the water from many points of view, but, contrary to every experience, was sad and uncomfortable. I tried to arouse myself from what I deemed to be a folly. Despite my efforts, however, an unpleasant, undefined sensation of dread and antipathy was creeping over me. At times it seemed to me as if the shadow of some coming event was falling in my path. I felt a premonition that, in the future, I should look back upon this occasion as the precursor of something to be dreaded; perhaps an impression never to be effaced. 
               Neither that peerless zone borrowed from the shimmering mering winter sun, nor that mantle of snow glittering in unsullied purity, could detain me longer. The zone, I fancied, was only a lure, and the snowy mantle a cloak of treachery. All the ravishing beauty of scenery, that had never failed to thrill me with delight in my summer visits, now had quite vanished-Quel malheur! I thought, as I turned to quit the scene, heartily disappointed. 
               Often as I had visited the spot in summer, I had always carried away in memory new perceptions of its beauty, and a deeper reverence for the serenity and majesty of its immense power. Now, however, I felt nothing beyond dismay and undefined horror. The Indian Legend that dooms a fixed number of involuntary human sacrifices annually to the Spirit that broods over its waters, ran through my mind. The Cataract presented itself to my imagination as a devouring monster. Then my schoolboy reading and my wandering in Paris picture-galleries, brought to my memory the numberless renderings of the story of the cruel exposure of Andromeda upon the rocky shores of thiopia. I was actually becoming uneasy, and growing very impatient and fretful. 
               I turned towards my hotel, and was threading a narrow path, half snow-spray and half frozen ground, looking ing downward and musing, when suddenly I came full upon (not a lion in my path, but) a fair young girl. She was gazing intently over the shelving rocks, and into that yawning, growling, and roaring abyss below. She was apparently spell-bound, and unconscious of my approach. Involuntarily, I stopped to look at her. She was clad in a simple winter dress of grey stuff. Her mantle was trimmed with grey fur, a little darker in shade than the dress. Her bonnet of nearly the same hue, was drawn a little back from her face, while her glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes showed she was no stranger to the open air of a bright winter day. 
               As I saw she did not heed my attempt to pass by, and it became necessary to speak, I addressed her, making some casual observation upon the view before her. She looked up with great wild eyes, moist with emotion, and seeming timid and frightened, saying she hoped, if I was a stranger, I had found the scene as fine as I had expected. There was so much artless enthusiasm in her accent, that despite myself I felt interested, and engaged her in conversation. Finding she would return by the same path as myself, and was alone and on foot, I begged leave to walk with her to her home, which she informed me was near at hand. My offer she cordially accepted. 
                
               The moment we turned our backs upon the prospect that had appeared to impress her so powerfully, the young girl began trembling violently and became silent. It was with the greatest difficulty I could calm her agitation, of which too, at first, I was unable to discover the cause. At length, without being told it, the truth of the matter flashed upon me. It was this. As I had spoken to her in the path, when she was under some high excitement, her impulsiveness had made her forget that a strange gentleman had addressed her, and she had unconsciously suffered herself to be led into a conversation. Now that she had recovered herself, she was shrinking from an apprehension lest her maidenly propriety had not stood well upon its guard. I know not why it was, except from the sudden transition of my own thoughts from the horrible to the beautiful, but when my eyes had first fallen upon her, I too had felt a vague suspicion some danger to her was impending. I began to be interested in her more than I could otherwise account for satisfactorily. I conjectured I had acted upon some mysterious prompting of duty to draw her away from the dreadful scene of power which, in my indistinct imaginings, I had fancied to be working a fascination upon her that promised her no good. Perhaps both of us had acted from some blind impulse, moved by a magnetic fusion of vague impressions. Now, however, these had vanished with the scenes that suggested them, and, although strangers, we had found ourselves, to our own surprise, talking together almost familiarly. Unconscious danger had leaned upon unconscious protection. When that scaffolding, upon which our minds had met (being too frail and gossamer-like to stick in the memory) had dissolved and faded away, and we stood, as strangers, face to face, each recognised only that literal fact; and then a vague fear that either might misapprehend the motives of the other had succeeded. Thus we walked some steps in silence. 
               Gradually, however, this unsatisfactory state of mind passed off, and our conversation became unrestrained; when, just as we were approaching the gate of the cottage, where the young girl resided, a tall gentleman, dressed in black, came out of the house, and walked lingeringly towards us. His eyes were fixed upon her inquiringly, but he seemed scarcely to notice myself. This rather piqued me for the moment, but excited my curiosity the more. As soon as she saw him, leaving me unceremoniously, she ran to meet him, and I heard the names of "Walter" and "Florence" simultaneously uttered. I Stood still for a moment, hesitating whether to turn back; but curiosity held me immovable until they approached me, while "Florence" gave a satisfactory account of my presence, and "Walter" became a very agreeable person. 
               There was something so unusual yet undefinable in their manner towards each other, as well as towards me, that I found myself interested the more every moment. I quite forgot how far I had trespassed upon their courtesy, until, upon looking at my watch, I found I had been talking with them at least two hours. As I was leaving the cottage, being asked if I would remain near the Falls (although I had purposed returning in the night-train by railway to New York), I determined to see more of my new acquaintances. I was cordially pressed to visit them on the following day, and took my steps towards my hotel, speculating upon their respective characters, and resolving to return and see more of them. 
               The following afternoon found me a visitor at the same cottage. It was a neat little house-cosy and cheery in the winter sunshine. I could easily see that its fair occupant found a good deal of care well bestowed, during the summer, upon the flowers, vines, and shrubbery, that had left their vestiges on every hand where winter had overtaken them. I learned the young girl, Florence Murray, was the orphan child of a British officer of inferior rior rank, and was living under the protection of a fellow soldier, who, though somewhat older, had served with her father, and was an uncle upon her mother's side. I also ascertained that the gentleman in black, Walter Ashwood, was regarded as a suitor of Florence, who, although he lived in New York, found time to study nature, and admire the picturesque and the beautiful, upon the Canada shore of Niagara Falls. 
               I passed some days very pleasantly in the company of my new friends, and found my feelings very much enlisted in their behalf. This acquaintance, thus accidentally formed, so ripened, and lasted so long, as afterwards to put me in possession of some information concerning the subsequent circumstances of their history. Many papers and letters belonging to them have been entrusted to me; and from these, with not a little close personal study of the characters, I have endeavored to put in more connected form some of the leading motives and events of their lives. 
               As their peculiarities dawned more clearly upon me, during my acquaintance, and as their characteristics, from time to time, took shape in my mind, I began to jot down some of my impressions. Passages in the following chapters were thus written. 
                
               As I now sit down to tell their story, I interweave these contemporary memoranda, where they have proved correct, or can shed light upon the characters, thoughts, or actions I seek to portray. If my story shall be found to lack sequence, or to abound in tedious repetitions, this must be my apology. 
               There are some other circumstances connected with the earlier years of these persons that I think it better to relate here, before beginning more formally to unfold the outline of the brief histories I purpose to sketch. They will be found not unimportant in unravelling the characters of those who appear before us; and, hoping they will not be considered tedious or superfluous, I proceed. 
               The mother of the young girl had died, soon after her daughter had reached her eighth year. With a frail constitution, she had sunk gradually, upon receiving intelligence of the death of her husband, who fell a victim to fever consequent upon excessive fatigue in service. Mrs. Murray had some characteristics which had been transmitted to, or been impressed upon, the nature of her only child. Herself a soldier's daughter, she had, nevertheless, a great preponderance of qualities that were better fitted for the boudoir or the bower than the companionship of a hero of the camp or the field. She had been slight in person and fair in complexion, with blue eyes, and hair between golden and a very light chestnut, and rather above the middle height. She was always noted among the friends of her husband for great vivacity of spirits, rapid and amusing conversation, and sparkling beauty. She was a general favorite among the army officers, and, following the fortunes of her husband, her life had led her much away from the society of her own sex. All this, however, had in nowise affected the modesty, womanly gentleness, or tenderness of her nature. She was the same sweet ministering angel, in all the rough scenes of military adventure that some years passed in India had brought to her lot, as when surrounded with the comforts and luxuries of her beloved home in rural England. 
               Mrs. Murray's most striking peculiarity was the masterly combination of an unrestrained capacity for vivid enjoyment, pleasure, gaiety, and happiness, united with a total self-subjection to the most permeating and fervent piety. While she was thoroughly a woman in all her tastes, desires, fancies, aims, and belongings, even to whims and caprices, yet no levity, inconsistency, freak, passion, prejudice, or excess, ever shook or invaded the sanctity of her real self, or brought a blemish upon the pure heart and spotless soul she dedicated to her Maker. She was not very apt to be communicative about what concerned simply herself. It had, however, required no very close observation or long acquaintance, to render obvious to any one, that the religion of Revelation was the controlling guide of all her actions. It had never impressed any one as having been an acquirement, or a result of education or association, or a condition of mind and heart, that could be either modified or erased by any, possible event of life. Nay, her piety had seemed to be so interwoven with, and so interpenetrating all the motives and actions of her daily life, that it could no more be dissociated from her character, than the blood from her body. There was never any ostentation about it, but rather a perpetual determination on her part to prevent any display that should draw attention upon it. Still, it was obviously the central pivot, upon which her every action turned, and the point from which her every characteristic radiated. 
               Upon the first dawn of intelligence in her child Mrs. Murray had striven to imprint upon its struggling mind, the clear impress of these solemn convictions and sweet consolations. They had grown with the child's growth, and Florence thus got by direct succession a saintly purity, and sweet loftiness of character, so rare that only those who had known her mother, could believe one so young and childlike capable of it. 
               Although Florence's mother had been taken from her at so very early an age, the recollection of her was sufficiently distinct to be a source of very great satisfaction to her, and to have much influence upon her character by force of mere example. Her guardian, however, though tender of her almost to doting, was quite incapable, in his hard soldier-like heart, of comprehending the subtile workings of a supersensitive nature like that of Florence. As the child grew up, she clung to him by a natural instinct, and fancying him the source of all knowledge, puzzled and bewildered the grim old soldier with her delicate fancies, her sagacious and wild questionings. He tried to explain, and then to soothe and quiet the troubled spirit of the impetuous child. But he disappointed her, and she soon ceased to question, or to listen to his philosophy. She was of a highly imaginative cast of mind, and excitable temperament. For want of congenial companionship, she gradually fell into a habit of self-communing, and solitary way of thinking, that led all her feelings away from those around her, and often made her actions seem eccentric. She had but few books; even these were injudiciously selected, and rather calculated to exaggerate the irregular tendencies of her mental development, than to give tone and correct progress to her thoughts. 
               Her secluded life had thus flowed on with little or no variation in its rustic routine, until she had met Walter. From the time of making his acquaintance, her whole character and conduct changed. She became gay and cheerful, almost to excess. Her intellect seemed to expand, her imagination became curbed, and she evinced a thoughtfulness, steadiness, and maturity of opinion beyond her years or her opportunities. Her quick intelligence had detected in Walter's superior cultivation, natural powers, and familiarity with the ways of the world, that philosopher, friend, and guide, of whom she stood so much in need. Her inclination towards him, too, was so natural and imperceptible, that his influence over her had almost enslaved her to his will, before she was aware of his power. 
               Walter Ashwood was the son of a poor clergyman, who had lived in the interior of Connecticut. His mother was a lady of rare endowments, who had left fortune and affluence, and all the sweet ties of affection and kindred in her native state of New York, to defy her family, and follow the fortunes of the object of a very youthful affection. Time brought to her the wisdom that her friends had in vain attempted to supply in her youth. Still her pride had sustained her, while she bore the galling yoke of an unsuited matrimony in sweet patience and majestic silence to the end. Her years had not been happy, or very long, and the management of the youthful education and life of Walter had chiefly fallen into the hands of his father. 
               This had proved a sorry misfortune for poor Walter. He was of a proud, sensitive, and moody nature. While he was so gentle, that, through his affections and love of the good-will of others, he was led as easily as a lamb; still the least attempt to force his inclination resulted in a revolt and explosion that were terrible to witness. His passions and temper were most powerful, and when thwarted and abused threw him into a blind fury of excitement that for a time would put him quite beside himself. Such a son required the most careful training from a judicious and loving parent. In this respect Walter had been singularly unfortunate. His father, Grunzeback Ashwood, as little understood his child's complex and fitful nature, as if the child had been a mummy. His cardinal theory was, that all children were alike, until domestic or academical training made them different: in other words, that a child was born without a potential character or disposition, but simply with a surface impressible like wax. 
               Seeing therefore that nature had neglected to make him a human being for a son, this profound philosopher had set about supplying the deficiency. Woeful work the Iconoclast had made of it. There was no form of domestic despotism that had not been exercised by the father upon the son. He had never trusted his child in the most unimportant trifles, but was suspicious both of the boy's integrity and capacity. Hampered in every thought and action by the petty tyranny and minute surveillance of his conduct, Walter naturally soon learned to conceal his character, and to cultivate his powers of dissimulation. Then, the stream becoming subterranean, all its current was in darkness. 
               His father claimed also the right of corporal punishment. As a boy, Walter had smarted under the lash like a felon, or a dog. Each time he had determined it should be the last; that he would turn upon the paternal despot, and revenge himself even to death. But the dread of parricide was always too strong for his highly sensitive and imaginative mind. So, he gnashed his teeth in impotent rage, and the rancor and venom generated by the degrading insult, sank into his heart, and poisoned and embittered his fountains of life for ever. He grew up silent, reserved, shy, and melancholy. Brooding over his wrongs and sorrows, he kept himself isolated from his fellows. At college he was known as "The Solitary." As he came into life, and began the study and practice of the legal profession, he had taken some pains to adapt himself to the ordinary courtesies of social intercourse, and had acquired an appearance of frankness and geniality that carried him through the ordinary forms of life, not ungracefully. With all this, however, among men he was essentially a reserved, self-poised, impenetrable, imperturbable, mysterious, inexplicable man. Such was the perfected pupil of the Grunzeback school. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER II. 
                
                   
                     
                        "Let a boy once distrust the love or the tenderness of his parents, and the last resort of his yearning affections-so far as the world goes-is utterly gone. He is in the sure road to a bitter fate. His heart will take on a hard iron covering, that will flash out plenty of fire in his after contact with the world, but it will never-never melt!"
                      
                     D. G. MITCHELL. 
                   
                
               WALTER ASHWOOD was neither a rake nor a debauchee, and yet, morally speaking, he was little better. He was restrained from sin not so much by principle as by taste. He had found out a refinement in wrong to womanhood, that put the common rebellion of appetite to the blush. He was a great admirer of women, and found all his friendships, and most of his associates, among them. His inclination towards them, however-if one might judge by his conduct-was much as Iago felt towards his friend Roderigo, when he says, 
                      
                        "For I mine own gained knowledge should profane 
                        If I would time expend with such a snipe 
                        But for my sport and profit." 
                     
                  
                
                
               To speak truthfully, he had no conscience in the matter. He had so long sought his own amusement at the expense of the dearest treasures of the female heart, that he had come to look upon himself as a sort of chartered libertine, that might wander at will, seeking his prey where he could find it. He had brutified his nature by a narrow philosophy until it had lost all its original brightness. 
               Endowed with some pretensions to manly beauty, his eyes flashed or softened at will, as he feigned intensity of passion or subjugation to emotion; while his voice at times lapsed into tones so gentle and winning, that when they spoke to a woman words she most wished to hear, they dwelt in the chambers of her memory while life lasted. 
               Still it was difficult to understand in what way he contrived so readily to acquire an ascendency in the affections of women. His inconstancy was known to a byword, yet had he a power of fascination that overcame the prejudice of evil report, making him victor many times, when forewarned prudence had bid defiance to his assault. 
               He generally succeeded in arousing that species of love that grows rapidly into infatuation, and breaking over rules takes pleasure in fancying itself exceptional. He rarely or never had occasion to avow or simulate an avowal of love. His tactics were altogether too sublimated an essence of cruel mockery for this. The chief point of his game was to force this concession from the other side. This done, he would at first seem to reciprocate it. But there the growth of the tree stopped. It never grew any taller, or shot forth any more leaves or branches. The word marriage could not be found in his vocabulary. The bare mention of it sent a shudder through him, as if you had proposed he should leap into Vesuvius. 
               Woe betide the poor girl who set her heart upon the affections of Walter Ashwood. If she waited for him to offer her marriage she would surely "lead apes in Hell." When the first reaction came (after the victim of infatuation, forgetful of the sacred reserve of womanly delicacy, had humbled herself in the dust in willing sacrifice) naturally she waited with suspended breath, for a response deep-toned, self-abandoned, worthy of the holocaust. But she waited in vain. Further she could not advance, further he would not. Having set all custom and law of society at defiance, she could not be politic now, without giving him the very advantage he sought. If she counselled selled prudence or caution, or demanded hostages for the future, she was furnishing him with the ready taunt, "where was now the fiery passion that broke over the barriers of prudence and caution?" and, "why did she not demand hostages before she made unconditional surrender?" 
               Could human baseness find a lower depth than this? Was there no thunder in the heavens to blast this architect of ruin? Who shall tell the depth of human misery it was in the power of this one miserable man to inflict upon those whom he taught to look upon him lovingly and trustingly? Had he no human heart? Alas! he himself sometimes verily believed he had been denied that. No sooner did he hear the first lisp of love, than all his feelings recoiled. Often and again was the hope suggested to him; now surely he was waking up to honest reciprocation of gentle woman's love. It was a phantom, and faded at the approach of light. 
               There was, indeed, amid all the sterility of his dragon nature, a strong craving for something to concentrate his attention upon; something he might cling to, live for, and die for. But it was so vague, and had so successfully eluded all his attempts to analyse it, guide it, or cultivate it, that he had pretty much abandoned it as for a total loss. Yet it sometimes floated through his dreams as a possibility to be grasped at. Florence touched him at this point. She knew nothing of his history, and had met him with the guilelessness of a child. He had not approached her as a gallant or a suitor. There was something weird about her manner and looks, as well as a far-reaching sympathy in her thoughts, that captivated his imagination and exercised an influence over him he could not always explain. 
               Walter Ashwood had become a man, selfish to the core of his heart. Keeping this out of view, he was rather an amiable person. I don't think nature made him so selfish. Under more fortunate circumstances, those traits of his character which (being acted upon and colored by the events of his life), through their composite influences, had produced selfishness, might have made him self-sacrificing and generous, perhaps chivalrously so. I suspect and partly know the secret. As I have said, he had been thwarted and baffled in his youthful impulses, tastes, and fancies-in the bent of his natural disposition, and in the first growth of his aims and purposes in very early life. By the strong arm of domestic tyranny, he had been so broken and overcome, that the manliness and self-reliance of his nature were literally beaten, crushed, and cuffed out of him. This circumstance had produced in him an apparent weakness and want of energy, strongly contrasting with his possession of a physical courage that bordered on daring and foolhardiness. 
               The vice that poisoned all his character was moral cowardice. He fortified against fate and time. It manifested itself in a want of faith in himself, a distrust of the future, and a fear of results, that was strangely incompatible with his strongly-marked temperament and his powerful passions. Still he was so-all selfishness. Without practical faith in the unseen and intangible, with him one bird in hand was worth a bush full. 
               When he had first grown to manhood, he had brought this lurking demon of distrust into life with him; and then came the struggle for subsistence and position. How should he make his way in the world? Having adopted a profession, success and fortune had crowned his exertions. Then came satiety and disgust, and it ceased to attract him. An element of vindictiveness in his character had alone rescued him from floating at random upon the wide sea of indecision. He was firm, pugnacious, and resentful by nature; but all these characteristics (instead of being kept in the background as restrained allies of faith in himself and others) came up in the front rank to lead his resolution. He determined to indemnify himself for what he had suffered. He had never been trusted, and he determined to trust nobody. Having been subjected through childhood and youth to petty deprivation, and restraint the most galling to his exuberant and exacting nature, he now resolved (while compelled to bear the fatigue of existence) to appease and gratify that offended nature, so far as in his power lay. He had been, he imagined, the sport and puppet of others, and now he would play the game himself. There is the key-note of the character of Walter Ashwood. We shall see more of him in this light by-and-by; but let us look a little at the exterior of the man. 
               He was about thirty-five years of age at the time I now speak of-tall, well and compactly built, with an open and rather handsome face, pale, but a little too dark. His features were sharp in outline, and massive; his mouth was delicately cut, refined, expressive, and well set off by a dark and flowing heard. His profile was striking; while his straight black hair and glittering white teeth were in strong contrast. 
               He had clear, steady, dark brown eyes, and a full, broad, projecting forehead, retreating slowly, and not very high-as the phrenologists would say, "in the region of benevolence and veneration, small." With all this, there was at one time a sort of hesitancy in his manner, and, when I first knew him, almost an awkwardness of carriage that was not quite diffidence, yet betokened indecision, or a weakness of character somewhere. This was very apparent in mixed companies, and sometimes even ran into shyness and reserve where many were present. With a single companion, however, his manner fell into the opposite extreme, when he was too careless, and his style of conversation often became quite didactic, or like one thinking aloud; and again, especially with women, almost too familiar and insinuating. 
               Subsequently, as he travelled, and, mingling more with the world at large, became better assured of his own powers of pleasing, this slight provincial rusticity, so reflective of his character, wore off, and he became in his manners 
                      
                        "--like a pebble of the ocean, 
                        Grown polished by continual motion." 
                     
                   His voice had great depth and volume, with much softness and sweetness of cadence, and a clear silvery ring in some of its tones that was quite thrilling. The versatility of his conversation showed a scholarly profoundness of thought and a breadth of general reading; while his acquired geniality of manner, coupled with a show of frankness, altogether made him much desired in every circle where he chose to present himself. Society looked gently at his faults, and reserved all its condemnations for the folly and infatuation of those whose happiness he sacrificed. 
               Did Walter love Florence? To say that Ashwood loved Florence would be to answer a question that occurred to his own thoughts very often. It was, however, a reflection that crossed him only when in a peculiar frame of mind, and only when the honesty of his character had absolute sway for a moment. As soon as this was changed, and his selfishness stood on guard, he only saw a pretty woman whose admiration pleased him. His love was as ephemeral as the pious aspiration for a cloister, reputed, in song, to have filled the breast of an ancient invalid, who, as soon as convalescent, 
                     "The devil a monk was he."
                  
                
               Walter Ashwood, I blush to say, had never had, to his own consciousness, a sincere passion for any woman. So evanescent a sentiment as he had ever felt or experienced was not worthy the name of love. His character, not by nature, but as he had fashioned it, had become incapable of any strong or simple emotion. He had been so accustomed, from early suppression of his impulses under a parental arm, to check and conceal every natural feeling of his heart, that, like a bow always strung, its tension was gone. His original nature, as God gave it him, was now withered, dried up, dead, and buried. There was nothing natural about him. 
               The man, you saw, had a character, which was the compounded result of what might be called the resurrection of his nature struggling with the circumstances of his life. Circumstances, however, had so much got the better of nature, that the vanquished element was at times scarcely perceptible. Indeed, he was not himself: he was wholly artificial and politic in every permitted impulse and act-so, of course, in all matters of the heart, in affection, and passion, he was wholly false and hypocritical. 
               Policy may be a sagacious adviser in affairs of the heart; but the capacity for taking counsel of policy too often indicates an icy thread in the hot torrent of impulse. When Love detects this spirit of calculation, the suddenness of the contrast sends a shiver through him. That is the hatching of distrust; and where the element of suspicion lurks in love, be it ever so deep at the bottom of the well, there will be times when its distorted image will show itself upon the surface. Woe then to the hour of the first matured doubt, or of the first consciousness of being doubted! 
               Walter had not a really bad motive in his heart towards any individual. Carrying, however, uppermost in his mind, as I have said, a prevailing, general, morbid impression or notion (I can hardly define it so distinctly as to call it even a sentiment or conviction), that he had been cheated by fortune, and slighted by mankind, he was impressed with the belief he was entitled to indemnity in his own way. 
               He morbidly imagined he had been buffeted through life, misunderstood, forced into false positions, checked in his aspirations, slandered in his motives, misconstrued and vilified in his acts. Now he seemed to be claiming the right to go through the world without further liability to account for his actions, laying his hands on what he might, provided he violated no absolute law of society, and injured no man to the point of honor. 
               He also disclaimed any obligation of duty. He had never risen to so broad a horizon as to know that duty is the axis of the moral universe. He had not penetrated into the mysteries of individual human happiness, so far as to know that duty in some form-disguised or palpable-is the sole pivot upon which that happiness can be trusted to revolve. He would fain be of those who neither toil nor spin for others. He would sip honey from every opening flower, but gather or garner none. He shook all care and responsibility from him as a poisoned garment. Like Pistol in the play, the world was his oyster, which he with sword would open. 
               Florence pleased him. Her sweet talk was music-soothing music to his jaded ear. Her naturalness of thought, manner, and expression fell upon his heart like a summer rain upon a parched meadow, or like a balm upon a wound. These two persons differed so widely in all their apparent characteristics, that lookers-on almost wondered sometimes how they could endure the society of each other. Florence was for the most part so fresh and unhackneyed, that she seemed as if her eyes had been just now opened for the first time to everything beautiful in the world. Walter was as staid, tired, worn out, and incapable of surprise or enthusiasm as the Wandering Jew. And yet this antagonism of character attracted the one to the other. 
               Fairly to run our thoughts through the alembic of another's mind, is often to purge them of all dross, and to make the deposit pure gold. Admiration and active sympathy in another, are sometimes obstacles to this process: we may of ourselves try to look into our own hearts, but our passions will ruffle the surface of the mirror, and break it into a thousand ripples, so that the reflection is a distorted image, or a myriad of incongruous images. 
               How often we gaze into our own friend's face, and study his act towards us, and try thus to read our own hearts, untrammelled by self-love. Hard task! We distrust our strength to learn the truth. Then our emotions are so apt to disturb and perplex us with false lights, and deceptive shows, that the reflex is very wide of what we seek. But, sometimes, when we meet a person who has nothing in common with us, when we are, as it were, of two spheres, differing in their axes and their orbits (it being assumed that each is worthy, or seems so, in the other's eyes), what an involuntary desire springs up within us, to throw, as it were, our shadow upon this screen, and see what the figure will be. It is such a pleasure, too, sometimes to talk to those who don't anticipate us; who do not substitute their preconceptions for our utterances; who do take us literally at and for what we say; who can weigh and measure us, or our thoughts, without passion or prejudice, and with all the impartiality of entire ignorance of everything concerning us, except what we choose to reveal and exhibit to them. 
               It does not, indeed, require all this fine spun speculation to show why Walter was pleased with Florence. Her beauty alone would have been enough to speak of, but her freshness and joyousness was of all things just what his vampire nature most thirsted for. Indeed, his was a soul that had no longer any purpose or object in this life. He had accomplished his work, and closed his accounts in this world. He was old in youth. Though of few years, his soul had already worn a body more than the ordinary duration of a single human life. Measuring duration of time by the succession of ideas, his soul might have claimed to be set free from his body, a long while before. Methusaleh's years seemed infantile to his protracted consciousness of inner experiences. 
               Poor fool! with the feeble and treacherous lights of his own profane brain, he had measured the height and depth of everything the Almighty has been pleased to bless this earth withal, and alas! he had found them all insufficient to stir the sense of duty within him. He did not know how to suffer and be strong. He lacked the faith of those who learn to labor and to wait. While life lasted, he would seek his own pleasure; but, to him, there was nothing serious in mortality. True, he reverenced God after a fashion of his own, but he impiously longed to be relieved of this life; seeing that to him it was nothing, or worse than nothing. It was, indeed, rather a burden. He would have shaken it off, he sometimes thought, had not He who gave it forbade, and set His canon against self-slaughter. In truth, he was imprisoned in his own body, like one in a trance, and as far removed from happiness as a helpless paralytic, who lives, lying prone and immovable, a pulsating corpse.

                     P. P. COOKE. 
                   
                
               FLORENCE MURRAY was a very pretty blonde. She was in her eighteenth year when I first met her, and wore upon her cheek the delicate bloom of the kind of health that comes sometimes to an indifferent inheritance of constitution, if wisely dealt with. The flush of youthful blood was there, and judicious physical education might perhaps yet have wrought into great vigor and tone the slumbering capabilities of her now slightly languishing figure. 
               This would, however, be the criticism of a very nice and practical observer. To the casual eye, Florence was simply lovely. What she lacked of apparent self-relying energy in her general manner, indeed, made her more charming and attractive. She was not tall, and her slight form would have seemed to want roundness of limb and fulness of development, but for a neatness and compactness of person, coupled with an ease of carriage, that was rather the result of tact than of grace. 
               Her large soft blue eyes, with their heavily fringed lashes and liberally pencilled brows, lighted up and gave a stronger and more open appearance to a fair countenance of somewhat diminutive features. It was a sweet face to look upon-a radiant face that would make a lover's heart ache for a kiss-but there was never a trace of anything in all her aspects of face or person, when in motion or at rest, to suggest the possibility of stirring a more violent impulse. I might safely say, she never for an instant impressed upon any one the fact that she was a woman. There was no radiation of sex in her atmosphere. 
               Then she was so lovely in her vivacity. Though her perceptions of the ridiculous were keen, her spirits boundless, her language ready and apt, her wit abundant, and her womanly discrimination of ordinary character acute; yet her heart was so tender of the feelings of others that she would not wittingly have wronged the most insignificant; and her good-nature was so profuse, that, if her wit stung for a moment, the ichor of the wound was not envenomed, but borrowed a balm from the shaft that had let it forth, and healed as it flowed. 
               Lovely Florence Murray! I see her now as she was after the close of the first summer I knew her. She has just returned from a ramble, and sits in her walking-dress by an open window. The brilliant colors of the autumn flowers, in the garden of her own cultivation that you see in the vista, seem to add a carnation hue to her cheek, and a vividness to her eyes. Her untied hat is thrown loosely back, her dress is slightly opened at the throat, and the light wind of a soft October day is shaking her profuse auburn hair as it falls negligently upon her cheeks and brow. 
               Catch her countenance in repose-no easy matter-and you are possibly (if a very dexterous expert in physiognomy) struck by a strange sadness of expression, such as often betokens a secret-rooted sorrow. It seems to straighten the lines of the eye-brows and the corners of the mouth, and reminds you of a look you may have seen in some storied picture of heart-sickness, springing from deferred hope-of some Evangeline perhaps. It comes upon you with double surprise, it is so at war with your first impression. "What can she know of trouble?" Possibly she detects your gaze of wonder, for that look has vanished. She rallies in an instant; and the rattle of her talk, the joyousness and spontaneity of her nature, and the sparkle of her wit banish all the daring conjectures from your mind; while the light of her full large eyes, and the varying sweetness of expression that her eloquent face gives out, chase away the shadows of tear traces, you almost fancied you saw there. 
               Florence was an enthusiastic admirer of all that is grand and beautiful in natural scenery. How vividly come back to me my first impressions of her. She is telling Walter of her walks. She has been for the thousandth time studying Niagara Falls. Her slight form elates as she recalls how she stood upon the cliff and saw at her feet a river of torrents that seemed as if some Titan arm had just loosed them from their mountain bed; how they swelled, and rolled, and leaped onward with the terrific energy of madness; and then, after a brief majestic pause, suddenly plunged themselves, with thundering sound, into an abyss, calmly and resistlessly, as if poured from the hollow of the hand of God. 
               Her heart beats almost audibly as she pauses in the excitement of her description, and then the reaction brings a momentary repose to her features; again one might catch a glimpse of that strange expression. She has forgotten my presence for the instant. The exhilaration of her intellect has sent a flash into the farthest recesses of her soul, and she seems to be spelling out in burning letters some written, troubles of the brain. But it is all over in a moment, there she sits, her face beaming in loveliness, and wreathed in smiles. How joyous and happy she is! 
               Next after a fervid religious sentiment that was so intermingled with every secret, spring of her nature, as to seem to be an intuitive element of her character, the love Florence bore the vague memory of her mother was the strongest affection of her soul. That mother, whose image she was, had taught her the religion she loved so well. These two ideas were always uppermost, and guided her in all her actions. They had got such complete and absolute mastery of her, before she had met Walter, that she believed it impossible any other passion or emotion could ever exercise any control over her actions, or occupy her attention otherwise than in a subordinate manner. 
               It was a beautiful sight to see how all her actions found their source in, or were referred to a recognition of, a Divine Presence pervading all space and all thought. It was a visible centre of motion, and yet there was nothing obtrusive or ascetic in her manner, actions, modes of thought, or speech. This pervading influence gave her a dignity and a lofty air, that were yet tempered with such rare feminine gentleness and delicacy, as never to provoke or render uneasy those whose range of feelings was on a lower level; but, on the contrary, every one at once accredited her for sincerity. True, there were those who blamed her for talking so little of herself-what only concerned her personally, and were disposed to consider her austere and ungenial, but better acquaintance settled these misgivings, until none knew her but to love her. 
               Her daily life was so wholly unselfish, and so much devoted to caring for the wants or troubles of others, that when she found her interest in Walter growing to be a serious and engrossing sentiment, she began to question herself as to how far submission to such passions was consistent with her duties in life and towards her Maker. Would these feelings grow to such strength as to interfere with that singleness of devotion to duty that had hitherto regulated all her movements? Would it not be selfish to let her own happiness become a prime object of pursuit in her daily life? Was it not sinful to give way to the impulsive and excited thoughts about Walter that she so often found absorbing and agitating her? Was she worthy of the attention of one so infinitely her superior? What had she in common with him? Was not the emotion all upon her side? What would her mother have said? Could she permit herself to imagine she could interest one so far removed by intellectual supremacy, from the low level of her sphere of thought and action? What was the meaning of, or whither tended her wandering fancies? What could Walter Ashwood find in her girlish immaturity to interest him? Was his kindness towards her anything more than the generous offering of a liberal nature to a weak and ignorant child, that might look to him for such interest and affection as a parent might bestow? Surely, nothing more could come of it? If she had fancied otherwise, it was an unworthy suggestion, and she would put it from her proudly. 
               How should Florence fathom the deep and turbid waters of the Stygian stream into which her young life was flowing? She was so gentle and trusting, that she put the most flattering construction upon every manifestation of Walter's character. If he was melancholy, she found her heart interpreting to her, that some secret sorrow pressed upon him, and that pride prevented his revealing it. If he lacked enthusiasm, and, with staid indifference, seemed to encounter the most stirring scenes of nature and events of life-things that called forth her most powerful impulses and sympathies-it proved to her an evidence that he was a creature of a higher order of intelligence than herself. He was impassive, she believed, from the greatness of his mind, the vastness of his ideas, and the power of his character. She did not, perhaps, look up to him precisely with awe or reverence, and yet, if this was not the feeling she entertained, it was near akin to it. 
               At first, she did not believe she loved him. Love was, to her mind, a sentiment as well as passion to be predicated of equality. She tried, often and in vain, to put herself in some light or position to be upon a level with Walter. He had expressed the strongest sentiments of friendship for her, and he seemed, to her, a friendly arm to lean upon-great strength, sure aid and comfort, one who protected and buoyed her up as a matter of course, and by a necessity of his own noble nature. She felt that no merit of her's attracted his notice. Indeed, she thought with very little distinctness or accuracy of all this matter, except to rejoice in the glorious privilege that had fallen to her lot, to be associated with the noble being her imagination presented to her judgment or her affections, and, with a timid aspiration, to wish that Heaven had made her such a man. 
               If any one had told her Walter Ashwood was cold, hard, and worn in his feelings, she would have indignantly denied the charge as baseless slander. Her imagination surrounded him with a halo that invested him with almost every virtuous quality and noble characteristic of human nature. I fear it would have been the same if he had been destitute of the feeblest trace of any one of them. In truth, it was utterly impossible for the guileless child of nature to understand this life-fretted, morbid, heartless man. 
               And yet, what charms to restless youth, with its askings, doubts, wonderings, and its hopeless stretching after truth, the matured and knowing mind and character present. "This is my ideal," it cries out; "this is what I crave for; this is my oracle; now I shall be understood, and shall learn to understand myself. Farewell the shifting quicksands of hope and fancy, vain speculation and stumbling in darkness! Now shall I find my way. This is my lodestar." 
                
               Florence was thus very far from comprehending all the elements that composed this smooth exterior. Walter Ashwood had thrown around him so much that was artificial, every sound of his voice, every gesture of his body, every look of his countenance was the result (now unconscious from long practice) of laborious study. To Florence's observation, this method and regularity of movement was the natural characteristic of one who had sounded the depths of all human knowledge, and who had solved every doubt that puzzled weaker minds. 
               Parental love had been snatched from her too soon, for her to know all its depth of tenderness and breadth of power. She longed with an earnest craving for something like herself, and yet unlike. Her companions were few, and mostly uncongenial to the more sacred and secret mysteries of her very sensitive nature. She had wandered up and down, looking out of the windows of her soul in vain elsewhere, for some reflex of herself, upon which she might fully rely for steadiness of purpose, and look for light in her pathway. She found all this, and much, more, in Walter, and she poured out at his feet the rich treasures of her young orphanned heart with more than filial profusion. She knew no more, in fact, of the God of her idolatry than Zuleica of the veiled prophet of Kohrassan; yet she bowed at his feet and truly worshipped him, while she seemed to herself but to pay him the respectful homage that was due his superior nature. Oh Walter Ashwood-heart of stone-why didst thou not melt! 
               Melt! Melt adamant, burn ice, but do not ask the heart of Walter Ashwood to yield itself up submissive to the influence of love. And why not? Is he not mortal? Can he hourly hear the soft tones of that girlish voice, or look upon that sweet and winning face, turned so earnestly and trustingly to him, while her ears drink thirstily every word he utters, and her eyes watch every change of his countenance, as if she would possess herself of every hidden suggestion of his soul; can he bear all this and not be affected? No-not quite that. There were times, as I have said, when the presence and gentle sympathy of Florence, for the moment, made him supremely happy-times when he questioned himself whether he was wholly invulnerable, and whether his fondness for this young creature was not making her necessary to his comfort and peace of mind. 
               Yet such suggestions but little affected his conduct. They were feelings of the heart, and by a rule in his philosophy, he never allowed these sentiments to control his actions. Judgment and reason, stultified by morbid distrust, were his pilot and guide, and they told him that to love a child like Florence would be nonsense and infatuation. It was not to be listened to. She would amuse him for the time, and he liked her talk and her ready sympathy with all that is good and great and high and beautiful in this world. 
               He tried to persuade himself he should do her no harm by his attentions to her. He would train and lift up her thoughts, and this would compensate for any detriment that might result to her from the association. What cruel mockery to the pure devotion of a loving woman! How little did Walter Ashwood then know of his own heart! How far did he fall short of even fathoming, all the influences that then agitated himself! How stupidly blind are we, always, when we obstinately shut our ears against the voice of nature within us, and by sophistical dialectics smother the promptings, of those higher and nobler instincts of our humanity, that outrun the deductions of logic!

                     BYRON. 
                   
                
               IT was morning of one of those fair days in the middle of July, that are the glory of our climate. The brilliancy of the sunshine was softened by great white clouds, piled and peaked like snow-drifts, that crowded the bluest of skies. Walter was at Niagara, and purposed going to New York on the following day. He had proposed to pass this day, in rambling over Florence's familiar walks, and for the hundredth time sharing her joy and exhilaration in watching the endless and varying beauty of these flowing waters. She sat now in a little parlor, looking across to the American shore, catching just a glimpse of the descent of the sheeted foam of the Horse-shoe Fall, sparkling like wind-driven snow, through an opening among the trees, that shaded her cottage. She was waiting for Walter. 
               The walls of the room, indeed, were uninvitingly bare; but the apartment had still a look of graceful comfort, one hardly knew how to account for. There were a few books upon the tables, a large bouquet of flowers under a small mirror, and the couches had easy pillows, while all the furniture was arranged as if it had fallen into its place, and had not been so put by design. A bird-cage, with a merry inmate, hung in one window, and creeping roses fluttered and whispered in another. 
               It was a very simple room-very plainly furnished, and yet one sank as naturally into a seat, and felt as unrestrained in it as if a familiar place. Somehow, there was nothing suggestive of upholstery, or crockery, or cabinet-making in it. Everything there was of the least obtrusive description, and seemed never to have been designed for any other purpose than just to fill the office it did fill. There was no slab-topped, varnish-glittering combination of wood and marble, striding out into the room, as if to say, "I am a table." There was no military precision in the phalanx of chairs, cautioning the sitter to pause before he moved one, and reminding him that it must be replaced. The mirror stooped a little forward, as if coaxingly giving the coming guest a welcome. There was a jaunty and liberal flow in the pretty muslin curtains of the windows, that seemed to say; "We hide the light from within or without, and are wholly at your service and pleasure." 
               I cannot tell why it was, or in what it consisted, but there was a serene atmosphere of refinement and quiet, reigning in that little room, such as the great, when pressed by public care, sigh for and dream of; and such as the poet feigns in his hours of abstraction. Florence reigned there. Her almost preternatural loveliness did really seem to impress itself upon the inanimate objects that filled the routine of her common daily life. It was one of those mysteries we shall never understand, until we know the secret of that other marvel (perhaps akin to this), how it is, that our souls govern our bodies by characteristic movements, and even stamp and impress themselves upon our features. 
               Walter would soon come now, and Florence sat in expectation. The early morning sun was shining down from over the east side of Goat-Island, through great masses of whitened fleeces of clouds, that subdued the fierceness of his beams, and pictured in the sky a feigned copy of the marvellous beauty of the foaming torrents below. The roar of the cataract, resounding with subduing echoes afar off, and the rush of the vast masses of leaping, living water, sending a tremor through the earth, like the quick tramp of millions of swift-footed runners, filled her ears as she sat near the open door. Her thoughts were far away from the book she held in her lap, with her finger pressed upon the place where she had stopped reading. She had been looking through a description of Swiss mountain scenery, and, though ravished with the glowing account of its beauty, it had given her pain. She had heard Walter often express a longing desire to visit the old world, and Switzerland in particular. She wondered whether he ever would go. 
               The old world appeared to her so very remote, that to go was almost as ill as never to return. He had spoken much of it of late. Indeed, he had playfully announced an intention of going soon. The thought sobered and saddened her. It appeared to her the same as if he were to die. To die-Walter die-and she survive! It could not be. There was a vagueness in the horrible sensations filling her, as this thought went through her brain, that bewildered her. It was the first clear conscious conviction that he had taken absolute possession of the citadel of her soul, and was supreme governor there. Indeed, it was no longer mere reve rence and hero-worship, but, over all, woman's love that subdued her now. Her will was gone. Her power was gone. Her whole trust was in Walter, and without him there was nothing, absolutely nothing, left to her. 
               To a woman so penetrated with pure religious sentiment as Florence, this conviction was startling. What could all this mean? Was this passion to sweep through her nature, devastating everything else, and leaving nothing but itself? Was not her idolatry of her lover tending to make the duties of her life distasteful? Would it, could it drown her conscience, or wreck her piety? Oh no, this could not be! She fain would have said, should not be, but the spell of the enchanter was upon her then, and she had no volition. 
                      
                        "As, at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies, 
                        Far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa; 
                        So, at the hoof-beats of fate, with sad forebodings of evil, 
                        Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of doom has attained it." 
                     
                  
                
               "No! no!" she cried, struggling with herself, "this must not be. May God give me strength always to love Him, and to cling steadfastly to the cross of his Son; though my earthly love consume me to ashes!" She clasped her hands upon her throbbing temples; scalding tears gushed from her eyes; and she sobbed, and gave up herself, in broken words of prayer and supplication, to heaven. 
               Stand back, Walter Ashwood! Let not the shadow of your form darken these narrow walls, now radiant with heavenly light! There is a holy presence here you must not disturb. Walter paused upon the threshold, and saw Florence, as her head tossed from side to side, rocked in her clasped hands. He knew of her extreme susceptibility, and sensibility, as well as the depth, purity, fervency, and vitality of her piety; and something told him that he had nothing in common with the holy ecstasy that now shook this fair girl, like a Pythoness of old. So, he stepped back and sat down, under the shaded porch, to wait for her. 
               Poor Florence! How her soul struggled to be free! At times, indeed, she was free; and she felt an assurance that her prayers mounted to the very Throne of Grace. She prayed for light and strength to break through the thraldom that was swaying away her heart and thoughts from Him on whom she had always leaned as upon a Friend. By degrees, as her horrible imaginings took form and distinctness, she began to see, and to shudder as she saw, that she had blasphemously set up a rival in her worship, and forgotten the first prohibition of the Decalogue. Then her bosom heaved, almost convulsively; she gasped for breath, and, swooning away, she sank upon the floor. 
               Walter heard the noise, and rushed to her assistance. He straightened her limbs, and bathed her hot temples with a little water. No person in the house had been roused. Gradually a little color came to her lips, then mounted to her cheeks. Her eyes opened gently as she lay upon her back; and looking up, she saw Walter. A sweet smile flowed over her face from brow to chin, like a sudden ripple in still water. "Oh, Walter! I am so glad this is you. I had such a fearful dream. I thought I was falling into some horrible abyss; some power I could not understand was dragging me along. You were near, but did not heed me, or could not save me. I was just upon the very extreme verge, and, becoming dizzy, fell. But it is all over now, and was only a dream-only a dream." Then the color fled from her face and lips again, and a wan and sickly pallor crept up to her eyelids, and her eyes closed, and a shiver ran over her frame-as if her nerves had been the strings of some instrument, and the Angel of Death had swept all the keys at once. 
               She lay motionless and lifeless. Walter was alarmed The perspiration broke out in big drops upon his forehead; and the fear that he was a murderer pressed like a great weight upon his breast. He almost sank to the earth. Then, rousing himself, with all his strength he gave his thoughts and attention to Florence. She soon rallied, and revived again. "It was nothing," she faintly said; "she feared that frightful vision was returning; but no, Walter was here, and she would not give way to such folly. Harm could not come while he was here to watch over her. Walter!" Then she pressed his hand to her cold lips, and whispered audibly to herself, "Oh, Walter! I cannot give you up!" and closing ing her eyes, her lips moved in silence, as if in prayer again. 
               Then Walter Ashwood was indeed touched. It was like the cry of deep calling unto deep; and the coming response should have been full and earnest. Walter lifted the slight figure of Florence to a couch, and knelt beside her. His heart was full to the brim. Should he speak?. He held her little hand clasped in his, and pressed his burning mouth to her lips. That warmth gave her life again. The effect was electric. She opened her great blue eyes, and looked into his troubled face. "Pray do not look so serious, Walter; I shall soon be well." She placed her arm about his neck, and drew him towards her with her newly-acquired strength, as if her feeble body was instinctively drawn towards the robust frame of that stalwart man, as to a magnet. That kiss should have exorcised a hundred devils, had they all possessed him at once. 
               But oh, perversity of human nature! As she struggled to bring her resisting nature to him, his coward soul recoiled. As she acquired strength in that struggle, and gave up her soul to his keeping, Walter fell back upon himself: and in his cruel heart, he left Florence unconsciously stranded there, upon the shoals of unrequited love, with no eye to pity and no arm to save her. For some minutes they were so still as to hear the violent beatings of each other's hearts. A moment's duration more of the helpless inanition that was now passing away from her, and perhaps the barriers of his unnatural selfishness would have been broken down, and the demon that governed him been chained. Nay, he might then have risen to the dignity of a true manhood, and the promises of his youth have come back to him; and life and light and love might have shone around him, in that little room, as when the Angel visited Abou Ben Adhem in his dream of peace. 
               Now, however, it was too late. The crisis was passed. His pity, that was so near akin to love, proved a very timid flower, and died in the bud. Alas, poor Walter! And yet, to do him full justice, the well-springs of his nature were terribly stirred, and would have burst out had they not been so thickly walled about, encompassed, and weighed down by a disciplined, artificial selfishness, as unrelenting and remorseless as death itself. So he drove all the gentleness and goodness of his nature back into his heart, and locked it up beyond the skill of twenty Florences to find it, or drag it out again. His features assumed their placid look. The serene smile of perfect self-possession, that always hovered over his face when in repose, came back, and Walter Ashwood was himself again. 
               He had never really a difficult part to play with Florence until now. Florence loved him, he knew; but he had never said he loved her. She had never before felt at liberty to say she loved him, and had been very cautious in her speech until to-day. True, she had been betrayed into it, when reason and pride were asleep; but the work was done. She was so truthful, that she would not prevaricate, or deny what she had unwittingly made known. Nay, although she loved Walter with her whole soul, and at times had placed him in her affections above her God, she would rather each of her limbs had been broken from her body, and her flesh torn with burning pincers, than to have said so many words to him, as that she loved him. Now, however, she had said it so nearly, that to her it was the same as if she had blazoned it upon the walls of her house, and she would not revoke or palliate it. 
               Walter knew this too. He was now dealing with a woman who by surprise had overcome a great scruple, and he must act with her accordingly. He could no more pretend not to comprehend this, than if a thunderbolt bolt had laid her dead at his feet. He must deal with this fact unequivocally. He dared not ignore it. The avowal had brought to Florence, too, a preternatural strength. She bent her wide-opened eyes upon her darling Walter with a steadiness that would have seemed sternness to a stranger: and did seem sternness to the guilty Walter. He knew she waited his answer. He knew exactly what answer she expected, and he dreaded to disappoint her. So he said, "My dear Florence, I love you more than any living being." Her eyelids fell. It was enough. Equivocally though he had spoken, she believed all, and more than all, and was happy. Oh, how happy in the recognised assurance of this love that she had dreamed of by day and by night! She scarcely needed the aid and support of prayer now. Walter was enough for this world, and the next too. Alas! how mysteriously and without the knowledge or intention of either one, the wickedness of this man fused itself into the gentle spirit of this pure child of God and made her unconsciously loosen her hold upon the faith of her youth, and let go the arm of that Saviour upon whom she had always called in her hour of trouble, and never in vain! 
               This was then the happiest day in the life of Florence. Walter would leave her to-morrow, and it might be weeks would elapse before she could see him again. This must be a red-letter day. They would pass it with Niagara and Nature. They set out for a long ramble. The air was deliciously cool. The whitened clouds lay piled up in towering masses from horizon to the top of the dome of the Heavens. Here and there, they were cloven with great fissures or abysses into which the sun was shining as if into a monster cave of stalactites; while climbing above the distant hills, they resembled the receding mountains and far-ascending cliffs of the regions of perpetual winter. Florence and Walter stood upon the top of Table Rock, and looked long and intently upon the unending masses of foam, as they leaped joyously into the flashing wreaths of spray. Florence clung tightly to Walter's arm, and gazed alternately into his face, and upon the moving waters before her. 
               "See, Walter, those beautiful Rapids, how the sparkling crests of the waves break, and scatter, and glisten in the sunlight; and how they seem tossing and tumbling in sportive delight, as if things of life, while they hurry on to the brink of the precipice! How they frolic and gambol and spatter each other, rising up and plunging below, as if the rapidity of their motion onwards was too little for the exuberance of their joyousness! Then how still they become, just upon the verge of the Cataract where that brilliant emerald-like green curve shows great depth and divides the running from the falling water! What a gracefully bending arch! How noiseless and apparently how almost motionless!" 
               "Yes, indeed, that is terribly beautiful," said Walter, "vibration is lost there in intensity of action. It resembles what is greatest in Heaven and Earth, noiseless and resistless. So the greatest powers in the moral and physical world work in silence. How still is power!" 
               "I do not understand you fully, Walter, but I acknowledge no greater admiration or love for the beauty of these scenes than mine. They possess, indeed, a fascination for me, and sometimes a charm or spell over my actions that I know not how to account for or even to control. I have watched and looked upon them from childhood; and they have become almost as necessary to my happiness as light and air. In my earlier acquaintance with them, as I now faintly remember, they filled me with terror. The perpetual dash, the swiftness, the rapid disappearance of the immense torrents of broken waves, and the roar of their tremendous grapple and plunge, all confused and stunned me. By degrees this noise became a toned and rhythmical sound, having the lulling and soothing effect of familiar music. 
               "Afterwards, I began to be pleased and to discriminate in what I saw; and now, the leaping, laughing water; the jubilant waves, that throw themselves into each other's white arms, and embrace so lovingly before they take the final leap into the clouds of foam below; the spray rising from the boiling torrent beneath, as if the spirits of the drowned waves were going back to the cloud-home of their infancy; all these, and ten thousand other shapes, and forms, and sights, fill my mind top-full with one fixed indelible impression of endlessly varying and multiplying Beauty. 
               "Let me talk of this, Walter, though I seem childish. I have sat for many, many hours upon the bank yonder, with my eyes fixed upon that sweet American Fall." 
               "There are beauties in those waters, all do not see," said Walter. "To see the full charms of any object in Nature, one must look with the eyes of love. Tell me, dear Florence, what you find there." 
               "My poor words can never describe what I love most. There is so much variety there, I hardly know which to speak of at first. Indeed, I know not why all should not see what is there. Can any eyes miss that rising tower of foam and spray that springs almost from the base to the crown of the fall, bursting into fragments at its top, and pouring down its fleecy snow-torrents on all sides like a vast fountain? How dearly I love to see its motion! Always the same, and yet changing every second. It looks so sweet and innocent, so pure and harmless. I sometimes think I would like to leap into it, and die wrapped in its downy folds." 
               There was a glitter in Florence's eyes as she spoke these words that made Walter look long and earnestly at her. He had seen many instances of diseased minds, and had often thought he detected some symptom of mental unsoundness in Florence, but the impression had never come to more than this-a conviction that she was a woman of very delicate and susceptible organization; and though she might, by a strong absorbing passion, be hurried into extraordinary conduct, yet with proper care she might happily never know of what eccentricity she was capable. Still he was startled at this last suggestion, and asked her why she talked so carelessly of giving up this life. Was not her love and duty here? She made no answer; she had none. Her wild suggestion was perhaps prophetic, but the time had not quite come for her to read the riddle. 
                
               "Look," said Florence, "how the water scatters into myriad drops on the verge of the trembling avalanche of water that thunders down at the entrance of the Cave-of-the-winds! I have lingered upon the edge of those underlying rocks many a day, and forgotten even life itself, in my joy, as I have seen that shower of sparkling jewels thrown over my head into the flashing sunbeams. It is not spray, or foam, or mist, or sleet, or steam; but every drop is a formed and glittering particle, taking all the prismatic hues as it falls athwart the sunshine." 
               They extended their walk to many places, where Florence had most loved to linger. They walked along the high banks of the river, and saw, in one look, the entire sweep and scope of all the Falls at once. They looked down that deep chasm, into the boiling, seething, bubbling surface below, so resembling a moving plain of verd-antique, varied with white, porous marble. They talked of the beauty of the trees, hanging over and half hiding the rugged precipices hemming in the river. They filled their memories with new visions of beauty as they counted the shadows of the clouds, marching noiselessly over the most tumultuous parts of the foaming torrent; or talked of the countless shades of green around them, as the wind turned up the leaves, or the sunlight or shadow fell unequally upon the varied foliage that everywhere bordered the enchanting scene. 
               Then they rambled over Goat-Island, and lay upon the grass to rest from fatigue of much walking; and there, all absorbed in the many-voiced music of the moving waters, forgot all the wonders about them, except that crowning glory of Niagara's loveliness-The Rapids. There the soul of Florence, no longer capable of restraint, broke forth. She talked enthusiastically, wildly. Such rapture, such utter abandonment to love of beauty! One might almost have fancied she was herself a water-spirit. Sometimes her thoughts appeared to be exciting her intensely, and yet were too vague, or too big for words. She would sit moving her lips, and chafing her hands, or pressing her forehead and temples. 
               "Did you see that?" said she, turning quickly to Walter, and pointing into the Rapids where they broke wildly against a sunken rock, and dashed in foam-dust high in the air. He saw nothing unusual. 
               "Surely I saw human faces in those leaping waves yonder, and a woman's hair floating in the water, and white limbs tossed upon the foam. Could I be deceived?" 
                
               "What folly is this, my darling?" said Walter. "What trick is your imagination playing upon you? Pray, don't let us misuse the bounties of nature, and give away our reason while we enjoy the pleasures they so sumptuously furnish us." 
               This was spoken a little sternly, and it recalled Florence to herself, like the sound of a trumpet. She rested her head upon his shoulder subdued; and then sobbed like a child. A new thought saddened her now. What would she do when Walter left her? Who then should guide her wanderings? Wherefore these questionings? Why did she have these terrible apprehensions? Walter had often left her before, and had returned to her; would he not soon return again? Yes. He had promised to return at the end of August. Did she doubt? No: she never had doubted Walter, and never could doubt one so good, so true, so noble; never could doubt Walter. Yet she felt uneasy without knowing why. Something foreboded evil. Everything looked bright, cheerful, and promising; still she was full of vague misgivings. 
               They walked homeward, as the day wore on-Florence leaning lovingly upon Walter's arm. It was contending against her nature to do this. She felt a maidenly repulsiveness towards such familiarity. But it seemed to her, if she let him go, he might escape from her for ever; and she must cling to him. All the long evening the same vague fear haunted her. They talked affectionately and lovingly of what they had been to each other; and Florence was happy. Florence tried to talk of the future, yet Walter made no response, or talked of something else; and Florence's heart fluttered and trembled like a bird that dreads a danger greater than it sees. They would talk of these things another time, Walter said. Late in the evening Walter bade good-bye to Florence, and went back to his hotel. He must leave early in the morning. He would come to see her again in the latter part of August. So she came down to the gate with him; and, as he leaned across it, he said, "good night," and sealed his promise with a kiss upon her lips; and turned away and left her. 
               When he was gone Florence's heart died within her. Something so saddened her. She knew not what it was. She wished to follow him. Once she put on her bonnet and went out into the night. The chill and darkness recalled her to reason, and she came back into the room and burst into tears. How long she lay upon her couch she did not know. When she thought to retire for the night, there was a faint streak of light in the east. She struggled earnestly with her confused feelings and groundless apprehensions. At times she believed her mind was deserting her. She would almost lose consciousness, and involuntarily pressed her head between her hands. Then she would gaze, as it were upon vacancy, for a long time motionless. However, as she rose, and walked to her chamber, new hope seemed to spring up in her breast. She prayed long and fervently for light and strength again, and fell into a sleep as sweet as if the Angel of Peace had kissed her, and watched her as she slept. "Good night, Florence!"

                           Resembling 'mid the torture of the scene,

                           I ne'er beheld so thin a cloud:

                     S. T. COLERIDGE. 
                   
                
               WHO has ever, in the love of Nature, studied the Falls of Niagara, without experiencing such sensations of pleasure as no other scene occasions? It is not to the sojourner of an hour, or even a day, I address myself. I say, "who has studied Niagara?" Whatever is grand in Nature and Art comes into the mind by degrees. Little by little we grow to its level, as we abstract it from everything else, and give ourself up lovingly to the subject of study. It has sometimes appeared to me, I could almost trace and mark step by step, the manner this mighty marvel finds its way into the understanding, and I am grieved to see that so many persons never fully comprehend its majestic beauty. 
               As one approaches it in almost any of its varied aspects, the first impression is found to be one of senseless clatter and noise. Soon the crashing sound and distant roar fill the ear, until the mind begins to waken, and to realize the presence of vast physical power. Then the force and celerity of movement of the waters in all their quickly-varying shapes, and their utter heedlessness of everything about them, arouse a sensation of terror. In this state, the mind lingers for a while; but gradually the extreme beauty, grace, and majesty of this tremendous power soften the sense of terror; and the soul is soothed as it is lifted into full appreciation of the sublimity of the scene. After a time, the impressions gathered from all the different points of view blend in the mind into a harmonious whole; each impression seems a part of some other, and either seems incomplete without the rest. Slowly this unity of effect, by the subtle power of imagination, begins to assimilate to moral types in the mind; and now Niagara becomes fixed in the memory forever as suggestive of Purity and Beauty in their most transcendant relations and forms. All the sense of terror passing away, it becomes gentle as a familiar friend. Ever afterward, it presses upon one its own overwhelming Beauty, and every other impression is swallowed up in this. 
               Florence could never remember her first or all her progressive feelings of appreciation of what she loved so well. Her memory carried her, with minute distinctness, no further than this last. Niagara was always to her, now, a thing of beauty, and a joy for ever. 
               Florence quietly walked on, in her daily routine of life, looking forward hopefully to the time when Walter would return. It seemed, indeed, a long time; but, have courage, and it would soon pass away. All the conflict in her feelings had now calmed. Her offended piety had been appeased, and had resumed its sway. Her love for Walter was still as fervent; but its fiery, soul-absorbing element had become so tempered by the avowal of it, that now, flowing on naturally, it no longer threatened to swallow her up. She was at peace with herself. Those vague fears and apprehensions, coming from her disturbed mind, acting upon so feeble a frame, had left her. The future looked bright and hopeful again. She could not see very far, or very clearly; but on which side soever she turned her eyes, she saw Walter, and that was quite enough. All went merry as a marriage bell. 
               Turn now, and let us see what was passing in the mind of Walter. He did not seem much disturbed. He had been the recipient of woman's love too many times, not to know how to deal with it, or what to do with it. Her heart strings might crack, but his were safe. Surely, he was not so thoroughly vicious or depraved by temperament or by discipline, as to gloat over and enjoy the agony of such a fair young thing as Florence. No; he was not quite enough of demon for that. Still he saw clearly that the end of the drama, so far as he meant to play in it, had come. He could no longer be neutral. His resolve was soon made. He had hitherto contemplated a European visit, and now he prepared to hasten it a little. That was all. Alas, blind fate! He never dreamed, then, how the gentle and susceptible nature of that young girl had intertwisted itself with his own. He reckoned her as many a one, whose avowal of love he had unwittingly extorted before. Yes: he would write her a brief note-sudden call of business-probable protracted absence-and so, good-bye, perhaps forever. He would dismiss her from his mind entirely, and then away to fresh fields and pastures new-to the wonders, the beauties, the novelties, and the antiquities of the other Continent. The letter was written. It was cold and heart less. It was meant to pierce and cut like a dagger of ice-and so it did. Walter sailed in the steamer for Europe, the day his note to Florence was put in the post-office. 
               Florence read the letter-a cold tremor ran over her limbs, and she lost all consciousness. The shock was quite too much. Her guardian found her, an hour afterwards, lying upon the floor, apparently lifeless, with the crumpled letter clutched convulsively in her hand. She was gradually revived, but could not be persuaded to give up the note. Her first movement of intelligence was to put it in her bosom. She would answer no question; nor could she be induced to speak of the letter, or the occasion of the condition of distress in which she had been found. No effective sympathy could be offered her, for none knew her trouble. With the high instinct of a soul greatly resolved, feeling her woe was remediless, she determined to bear her burden alone. 
               She was seriously ill, with occasional seeming delirium, for several days. By degrees, however, the shattered nerves resumed their tone. Still her limbs were feeble, and more than a week elapsed before she could leave her couch. There she lay, the weary night and livelong day, in her own pretty chamber, breathing of fresh flowers, that watchful hands brought each morning, her figure draped in white, bound with a simple blue sash, her fair hair confined by a single comb, with pallid cheek and thin lips, looking so hopeless and yet so uncomplaining. She might never rise form that couch to go forth again. She prayed God with all her strength she should not. 
               Her life and destiny had been a strange one. She had lived isolated from the world, and had known little except what she had gathered from a few books. She had had no example to follow. She knew nothing of a mother's care, to watch over her ripening intellect and maturing character. Her imagination was her world. Into that charmed circle Walter had planted himself, and his radiance and his shadow had covered everything else. Until she had known him her life had but little purpose, scope, or breadth. She had found so many obstacles in her pursuit of truth; her associates were so ill able to satisfy her inquiries, and so often had her intelligent curiosity been baffled and disappointed, she had begun to despair of ever satisfying her craving thirst for knowledge, until, by chance, she had met and interested Walter Ashwood. 
               His powerful, astute, and matured intellect had seemed to her an enduring rock to lean upon. He answered all her questionings, and opened new sources of intelligence to her. Her wavering soul anchored fast to his, and from that time her real existence had seemed to begin. She loved him in the beginning as a superior being, at whose feet she was proud to sit. Then, as she grew in intelligence and confidence, she loved him as if she had found in him a dear brother. By degrees, however, her womanly nature came out more strongly towards him, and she found herself loving only as a woman, and wishing that Walter might be only her lover. This had produced an exaltation of soul that bordered on phrensy; and when she felt that her love was returned, she was happy to ecstasy. Then came the thunderbolt; and there she lay, shattered like a broken vase, with all its perfumes spilled upon the ground and wasted. 
                
               Yet she never murmured. Nor did she hope. There was that, in the tone of the letter, and in what was unsaid, as well as its words, that forbade hope. She had been deceived utterly. She had built her nest upon the waves, and the first storm had swept it over the billows and far away, whither she could not fly. Yet she attached no blame to Walter. He had been led to his conduct by her foolish show of fondness for him. He had never professed love, until she had almost exacted the expression of it. He had been kind, good, and dear to her, so long as she had kept her woman's nature from him. Only when she had sought him as a lover, he had felt that he could not respond to so inferior a nature as her own, and he had honorably gone from her to put an end to all illusory hope. 
               Nobly pleaded Florence, but false as Walter himself! Thank your stars, Walter, for such an advocate! Pray that she may precede you in the next world, to be your compurgator! It is a far better plea than you can contrive, with all your crafty skill and subtle cunning. 
               Poor Florence! Walter was dead to her. She thought no more of him as living. She could not bear the thought that he was upon the earth, and changed from the darling of her imagination. That image was still a reality, yet, like every thing else upon which her soul now fed, it was unearthly. 
               She would lie motionless for hours, with her ear turned to the open window, as if spell-bound by the ceaseless roar of the hoary Father of Torrents. Her lustrous eyes outvieing the hues of the sky of midsummer in clearness, color, and depth, sometimes her face was fixed with the rigidity of marble, and sometimes tears came stealing down her glowing cheeks, and her lips tremulously moved, as if in articulation. Her attention seemed to alternate from the many-voiced waters up to her Maker, and then back to Walter. No other thoughts came into her mind. They seemed to be all she needed. The flowing water filled up all her capability of loving physical beauty, and her ideal-Walter had a beauty of soul that lifted her far above all the common realities of life: and so she looked steadily up to Heaven, and asked to be forgiven for loving life, and the beautiful things of this world, too much; and she prayed, if it might be, that she should be taken away from a struggle to which she felt herself unequal. 
               As time passed on, however, her strength returned, and she resumed her walks. There was always now a pensiveness in her eyes, but a firmer look in her features. Besides, at times, her cheeks flushed, and a wild glitter sparkled in her eyes that made one uneasy to see it. She was observed to pass more and more of each day wandering about the Falls and Rapids. She scarcely ever spoke of anything else. There seemed always a brooding phantasy in her thoughts she did not disclose, nor yet quite conceal. When she spoke, occasionally, she would become so much excited, when describing what new combinations of beautiful forms of water she had seen in her rambles, that her guardian became a little alarmed for the safety of her senses. However, he pitied what he could not comprehend or alleviate, and thought it more judicious to seem not to observe anything unusual in her conduct. 
               The seventeenth day of August had been a hot day; very little air had stirred the leaves or the grass; not a cloud had appeared in the sky. Before the sun was quite down, however, a light breeze sprang up, and white, porous, downy clouds appeared in the horizon, running up in mid heaven. Then the silver moon began to shed her softened beams. 
                      
                        "With what a soothing came the naked moon. 
                        She, like a swimmer that has found his ground, 
                        Came rippling up a silver strand of cloud, 
                        And plunged from the other side into the night." 
                     
                  
                   Florence sat alone upon the porch of her guardian's cottage. Her guardian had been absent all day at Toronto, and would not return till very late that night. Was she watching for him? The moonlight, at times, fell upon her pale face, and the set of her features, and the glare of her eyes, was fearful to look upon. Her thoughts were far away, and all life had gone out of her face; or some terrible purpose of her soul had stamped itself there. Her dress was all of white, save a black ribbon about her waist. A wreath of myrtle was bound in her hair. The evening air began to grow a little damp and chilly, but she did not heed it. There she sat, an hour or more, motionless as a statue. 
               The moon was now ascending high in the heavens. Sometimes it broke out with a great blaze of light that seemed to tip every pointed object with a glare of silvery whiteness; then a mass of broken clouds would sweep across its face, or it would roll through them, as if ploughing its course against their resistance. Florence arose, and, going in-doors, lighted a lamp, and placed it upon a table near the door inside. Then closing the door of her own chamber, she locked it, and put the key on the table beside the lamp. She stepped out of doors, locking the front door, and leaving the key in the door. She had gone down the walk as far as the gate leading to a wood, when she hesitated, stopped, turned back, and going in, laid upon the table, beside the key, a note addressed to her guardian. Then she passed out into the road, and turning, went up the hill; into an unfrequented path, across the fields and through the woods, descending to the river just beyond Table Rock. Upon the very edge of the foaming river, just before it breaks over the Falls, she sat down, screened from observation of anyone passing, by some projecting timbers lying piled there. 
               It was a thrilling sight to see that fair young girl, robed in white, sitting at that late hour upon the verge of that fearful precipice, with no light but the uncertain rays of the moon to guide her. As she sat there, with hands clasped, and eyes raised to Heaven, the clouds parted, and the moon came forth in all its glory, and shone upon her. Now there seemed an almost heavenly radiance to have fallen upon her countenance. I know not how else to characterize it. The stern aspect of her features and the cold glare of her eye were gone. There was indeed a settled melancholy, but still a look of peace and resignation spread over her face. Although very far removed from joyousness, a faint smile of satisfaction and content hovered over her lips, as they moved unceasingly ingly. She appeared to be talking to herself, or wrapped in prayer. This was no somnambulism. She was quite conscious of everything around her. Her eyes moved at times towards the moon, and then down upon the sheeted foam, and spray, and mist that plunged and scattered, and sparkled and wreathed itself in all its beautiful forms at her feet. 
               It was indeed a fearful sight to see her. The torrents poured on, ceaselessly thundering down, breathing death in every resonant echo; while the spray rose in the moonlight, and twisted itself in shapes of many a shroud and winding sheet. All the while the distant roar of the Rapids sounded like a funeral dirge, as the wind sighed and wailed sadly through the piney forest; and then a cloud threw its shadow across the moon, and its pall over every object. Still the gentle Florence sat unmoved. Her white dress fluttered in the cool night breeze, and her hair was becoming wet with dew; but her heated head did not heed the cold kiss of treacherous Night. Nay, ever and anon she clasped her icy hands upon her burning temples, and smiled as if they produced a sensation of pleasure. 
               She arose from the rocks upon which she had been sitting, and threw herself prostrate upon the grass. She was praying for Walter. Her own peace was made. By what specious sophistry of her dizzy brain, she had been led to bring herself, with dread purpose, here it is idle to speculate. She prayed long and fervently for Walter. She had nothing herself to forgive him. He had not erred towards her. Her prayer was that she might meet him hereafter, and that he might be unto her there what he never could be here. 
               Rising from the ground, she loosed her girdle and removed her outer dress and shoes. Then with garments and face white as snow, like a sheeted ghost, she stepped confidently down into the moving water, with her hands clasped across her breast. She had taken but two or three steps, when her feet were drawn from under her, and she was hurried towards the abyss below. Her figure rose and fell upon the current, and once her face, rigid as stone, flashed dripping in the moonlight. Then the leaping waves caught her in their snowy folds, and, wrapping her from sight, hurried on to that deep emerald brink, plunging with her into those fathomless caverns of foam. The torrents thundered on, the mist and spray rose high in the moonlight, and a frosted bow spanned the chasm where Florence fell, as if her spirit had risen in that cloud, and climbed that arch to another world.

               A YEAR passed away, and Walter Ashwood was still loitering in Europe. Intelligence of the untimely fate of Florence had crossed the seas with too much swiftness and directness. Walter knew all. He had suffered the keenest pangs of remorse, and shrunk from bitter self-reproach. He had striven by all the distraction of travel, and change of scene, to drive from his memory his base and cruel desertion of the gentle Florence. It was a damned spot, not easily effaced. She had, indeed, twined her affections about his nature with coils almost impalpable, but so strong that neither change, nor time, nor death could wholly loosen them. He had disbelieved this at first, then only doubted-but much reflection and long suffering had matured this conviction in his mind. Had he then loved Florence as she deserved? Alas, he could not believe that. He was wholly unworthy of her. Yet she had awakened within him a consciousness of capacity for a pure, high, and disinterested love. This had come by degrees to be a strong, yearning, and passionate desire, but he could find no rest for it, and it had led him a sorry dance thorough bush, thorough brier, like a will-o'-the-wisp. 
               And now, on the seventeenth day of August, the birth-day of Florence, Walter Ashwood stood pale and trembling upon the balcony of the Hotel de Londres et d'Angleterre at Chamounix, listening to the ceaseless roar of the little muddy Arve, as it rushed with rattling speed almost at his feet. At his left rose the mountains that lead to the Montanvert and the Mer-de-Glace; and on his right, over the huddled housetops, stretched away the splintered peaks of the Breven and the Flgere, while in front, bathed in purplish light of early dawn, in the majesty of its unearthly purity, towered up Mont-Blanc. To this his eyes always turned and rested, wander as they might. He had been some weeks travelling in Switzerland, and believed every capability of enjoying the beautiful wonders of nature had been touched. Nevertheless, when he had gotten a first clear view of Mont Blanc the previous afternoon, from the bridge of St. Martin, a dizzy and bewildering sensation of insupportable joy had almost stopped the beating of his heart. What sacrifice would he not have made for the willing ear of her love and friendship into which to have poured the mad thoughts that then went beating through his brain! 
               At night, when more calm, and the cool evening air of this ice-girt valley had soothed him, he had sat by his open casement in the light of a full moon, gazing upon the same snow-robed enchantress, and had written: "Oh, what a vision of beauty! Dazzling whiteness flashing in sunlight, or sleeping in moonlight far away, soaring into the very sky! An angel might well stoop to such a pedestal to look upon this world. I would willingly have suffered any deprivation to have held the hand of my darling Florence, in that moment when this magnificence first was unfolded to my eyes to-day. Full well I know how her heart would have throbbed, and how her great blue eyes (now, alas! ashes) would have opened. Mont-Blanc itself might well have rejoiced at such a liquid mirror. Ah! Florence, thou art ever with me, when the grand and the beautiful in Nature are around me! Thou didst teach me how much they could be loved! How could I have been so blind, as not to have known that she was the dayspring of my life? She has gone, and why do I linger? Oh, God! the tears gather and blind my eyes as I write. Why am I left to cumber the earth, when I can find neither motive nor impulse to action or usefulness in it? The enjoyment of the wonders of this magnificent piece of God's handiwork only forces more strongly upon my attention the one dreadful fact of my life-how much was taken from me, when that angel-face lost intelligence, and those wide blue eyes gazed upon me for the last time. Oh God-take me too-let me not delay. Every day tells me, I have no business here." Here his pen had stopped, and his hand had refused to write. He had thrown himself prostrate upon the bare floor of his chamber; and how long he had lain there, a senseless clod, in the streaming moonlight, weighed down with the bitterness of his agony, he did not know. 
               In that way, however, he passed most of the night; and he sought in words of prayer to God, for help and light. The fountains of his nature were all stirred to their uttermost depths. Out of this terrible crisis, he might come a raving maniac, a whimpering idiot; or he might come forth a regenerated man! He had been very deeply moved before, but never so much as now. All of the splendors of the past few days had been working upon his imagination, and Florence had never left his memory for an instant. She it was, who had seemed beckoning and leading him on through this wilderness of magnificence. He had become wrought up to such a pitch of ecstasy, his overstrained heart must find relief somewhere; or it must break. He remembered now Florence's last written, but once unheeded words. "Will you, my beloved, in your hour of trial, turn to your Maker for help and comfort? Go to Him, Walter, in the right spirit, with an earnest and contrite heart, and he will help you; fear not, shrink not-bow down before your Maker in humility and truth, and he will still your unquiet heart." 
                
               At first he could only sob and murmur; then his consciousness seemed deserting him-a pang shot through his frame, as if a burning dagger had touched a vital nerve; and then all the pulsations of his body seemed multiplied and concentrated in his throbbing head. It was terrible, this self-torture of this strong man. By slow degrees, however, as he recalled the firm trust and sweet patience of Florence, his thoughts became clear and fixed upon the unalterable goodness and justice of the Most High. A permitted relationship to the Saviour of men, came gradually out in legible letters upon the misty screen before his eyes. He saw, or fancied he saw, that his own self-indulgent life had been an uninterrupted protest and defiance of that goodness and justice. He prayed with the utmost stretch of his intellect and imagination, and the most humble abasement of his heart. He tried to feel, as Florence had essayed in vain to teach him, that God was not a far-off Being, but a Friend ever at hand. 
               It was the very ridge and verge of enthusiasm and ecstasy-the dizzy height he was now scaling, and the slightest mis-step might have plunged him into the abysmal morasses of madness. But by God's help, he passed over safely. As he recalled all the events of his past life, and its trooping figures of good and evil, and of sin and shame, came out of the darkness-pressing themselves against his hot eyeballs, and would not be shut out, so deep a sense of contrition fell upon him that his groans would have moved a beast to pity him. And when the thought of how deeply he had wronged Florence (poor Florence, the guardian angel who was sent to save him!) could be no longer kept down, his hands convulsively sought his own throat; and nothing but a sense of the utter insignificance and hatefulness to her of such a sacrifice saved her the expiatory victim. Ah! Florence, wert thou not there in spirit that night? Didst thou not keep watch and ward over that narrow room, lest the fiends might enter and drag thy lover from the presence of God? 
               Now it was glorious morning. The dismal night had passed away. Walter was pale as death. All the fire of his physical nature seemed to have gone out, and he appeared as unearthly as the dome of snow he now gazed upon. But in heart and mind he had acquired the strength of a giant. He had seen his whole life summed up in a brief span, and had pronounced it utterly worthless. His early aspirations, long overgrown with weeds of selfishness, had been once more made visible to him. He saw how morbid self-torture had pressed down his energies, until they had lost their spring in apathy. But now he was changed. The great stone of despondency had been rolled away from the sepulchre of his memory, and the dazzling dreams of his youth came forth and he remembered, and vowed for ever to remember them: 
                      
                        "God! what a glorious future gleams on me; 
                        With nobler senses, nobler peers, 
                        I'll wing me through creation like a bee, 
                        And taste the gleaming spheres!" 
                     
                  
                
               Such was Walter Ashwood, as he now stood upon the balcony of the Hotel de Londres et d'Angleterre, on this seventeenth day of August, gazing at the first streaks of morning sunlight settling upon the summit of Mont-Blanc, and listening to the rattling noisy Arve, as it rushed bustling through the valley of Chamounix. 
               At breakfast Walter sat beside an American lady whom I must describe, as it will be necessary to introduce her into this strange piece of tapestry I am weaving. 
               Here let me say, did I not know how faithfully I cling to facts, I should dread the imputation of falsehood, or at least want of verisimilitude, in my story. I know very well, how unphilosophical it is to mistake particular facts
                   for general truths, or to put forth a history as valuable which has no merit but singularity. Yet common truths are so much written about, during the cacoethes scribendi, that scourges our day, my help is not required for their illustration; and if my cartoon shall be deemed bizarre in design or coloring, perhaps a new truth may some day be deduced from an accumulated development of eccentric character or incident. 
               Edith Sterling was somewhere in that misty border-land between twenty-five and thirty years of age. She was well formed, save a little too much roundness of limb and shortness of stature, and had regular but expressive features. Her eyes were dark and deep, and very luminous when she spoke. Her habitual expression was placid, but easily rippled into lines indicative of fun and mischief. A very little excitement flushed her cheek, and imparted a warm rich color to her fine tropical complexion, giving a brilliancy to her eyes that was very striking. She was a lady of much cultivation and refinement, and had mingled in the best society of the American and European capitals. She had that charm of manner, in which the sweetness of condescension is mingled with the easy confidence of self-reliance, and an apparent abnegation of consciousness. This made her a delightful companion as she always won her way with perfect ease, and made friends at every step. 
               She was a relative of an intimate friend of Walter; and he had joined her travelling party at the request of his friend, to lend her any assistance in his power. They had met at Geneva, and had ridden together in the Coup of the Diligence to Chamounix. All that lovely day they had talked together; and each had been unconsciously sounding the depths of the other's soul. Both had been in fact deeply preoccupied with their own secret thoughts; although both had seemed to say frankly all that was passing in their minds. The beautiful scenery, and the surprises of suddenly seen snow-peaks and glaciers, had often started them; so that each was at times upon the very point of uttering some exclamation, that might have roused the other more than the wonders of Nature before them. But the habit of self-control was so consummate in each, that neither had recognisably been betrayed, the one to the other. 
               And yet all this while, during the livelong day, these two hearts had tacitly acknowledged the influence of each other. Walter had never felt, in his soberest moments, a more calm power of self-control than while thus conversing with Edith. When he left her for half an hour, all this deserted him, and the reaction was so depressing, that he felt a sensation of having lost something, and was restless and uneasy without knowing why, but accounted for it by referring to the heat and fatigue of the day. Was he worshipping Florence vicariously? 
               With Edith the effect was exactly reversed. Recognising in Walter a thorough gentleman, and one who might become a sincere friend, she had essayed to meet him with all the frankness of an old acquaintance; but, despite herself, in his presence she had a vague feeling of restraint upon her volition. It was too undefined to take the shape of an idea or a thought at the time; but there was an influence exerted somehow by the presence of Walter, that made her feel all day as if she was struggling, through a misty twilight, for a perfect day she could not reach. It was very like the threading of one's way through the baffling mazes of an uneasy dream. All this, however, passed so far below the surface of her thoughts, as to be imperceptible to herself; except as the shadowy presence of something she could not grasp or define. 
               Still there was an apparent buoyancy and steadiness and strength in the manner of Edith that had fixed the attention of Walter from the first; and in his intercourse he had taken for granted a very great mutual self-respect. He had talked freely with her, and had been met with equal frankness. The natural emotions aroused by the passing scenery, they had unreservedly expressed to each other. Yet was each so perfect in control of action and speech, that there was nothing apparent to the casual observer to indicate either had a complex history, or was calculated to inspire any great degree of curiosity or interest in the other. 
               It is very certain, however, that each did speculate a good deal about the other; and each had had many old recollections and past associations revived in memory; without making them articulate or knowing what had brought them into view, during all that long and lovely day's ride to the valley of Chamounix. Here was indeed a state of mind that is hard to define, and nothing short of experience makes us credulous of it. Very frequently thoughts and fancies would burst unbidden upon the attention, without coherence or sequence to the mental preoccupation, and would depart as unceremoniously. It was as if the chords of association were a tangled mass, and volition in its hurry sometimes mistook, for the moment, one thread for the other. 
               Edith had been known to Walter before they met abroad; but they had seen each other only once, and that was some eight or nine years previously. At that time she had not attracted his attention; and he had forgotten her appearance and character, although remembering her name. Not so with Edith. When she had first seen Walter, although almost a child in experience of the world, she had felt there was a superiority about him that entitled him to her respect. Moreover, there was a winning gentleness and deference in his manner, coupled with a marvellous power of riveting the attention of others upon him when he chose, that had aroused her fancy and had impressed her youthful heart with a feeling she could only liken to what she had read of the effects of fascination. 
               That first meeting had not been very long, but it had been a very pleasant one; and Edith had long remembered it. Although it had cost her many a struggle with herself, yet reason and womanly pride had come to her relief, and she had put out of her heart absolutely all the traces of the disturbing image. In truth, Nature had so far vindicated herself in the frank and jubilant child, that Edith had forgotten, or rather, shall I say, outgrown, all recollection of Walter, except as a name of one whom her friends respected. It was, however, the resurrection of this dead and buried reminiscence, that had all day haunted Edith, without her conscious recognition of it. 
               Edith had seen and felt some of the sad, and some of the sweet experiences of life, since her young heart had first fluttered in the presence of Walter. She was then a girl just from school, romantic and impressionable, but now she was a childless mother, and a widow. She sometimes fancied (as we all do often) that she had run through the whole gamut of her capabilities of joy and sorrow. How we cheat ourselves with this fancy; and what blasphemy is this against the inexhaustible resources of the God-like nature we inherit from Him who made us in His own image! What profane heart dare whisper to itself that it has sounded all the depths of woe, or risen to all the exaltation of happiness, of which it is capable! 
               It is a part of the element of great joys and sorrows, that they should be so absorbing as to exclude from the mind, for the time, the belief of the possibility of any greater or other sensations of a like kind. We cling to our grief with an infatuation that makes the meat it feeds on. We envelope ourselves in it, and we will not look beyond it. But when time, or energy, or chance breaks open the film, our human-nature resumes its sway within us; and, turning our backs upon the past, we firmly take our places in the rank of life once more; nay, oftentimes stronger and better able to bear the fatigue of the march, or the strife of the battle. 
               It is far better thus, as He well knew who so ordered it. It is not to call me light, fickle, cold, or superficial, to say that I do not keep the past ever before me; or that I act as if I was unmindful of my vows of faith, and devotion to the dead. The past is a great ballast to the soul, but it has little motive power. If inaction and sloth be the type of human excellence, then let us hug the sweet memories of the byegones to our hearts; and let us float away upon the tide of life until shipwreck overtake us, and we go down, unpitied and unhonored. 
               But if this life be a scene of action, and we all have our parts cast for us in the drama-of-life, and we must do or die; then what has been (be it great sorrow, or great trial, or great temptation, or any other great experience of life) goes to make up ourselves, and is a part of us. Then, too, the sooner we amalgamate the effects of great sorrow or trial, with that composite entity we call our self; so that it shall not be an ugly excrescence, but shall form an elemental part of the united result we call our character; so much sooner will we find something given to us of steadiness, of purpose, of depth, of earnestness, and of meaning in our actions and words, that was never known to us before. The difference is simply whether a strong passion shall master us, and make us its bond-slave; or whether we shall master it, and make it an additional element of strength within us. Great souls never hesitate in this choice. 
               These transitions Edith had passed through. She had conquered their disturbing influences. Her sweetness of manner, amiable disposition; and the tinge of sadness that deepened the hues of a brightness that surrounded her whithersoever she went; all showed to the practised eye, that the perfectly lovely woman you saw was a watchfully matured growth, and not a work of chance. 
               If I undertake to get this personage fully before my reader; or to show all the framework she sat in while I drew her picture; or to set out all the mysterious thoughts that hovered dimly through her brain before she came to comprehend that she was nearing a great point in her destiny; I shall require a patience in my reader which I cannot expect, and fear I shall never finish this sketch. Nevertheless, there was still something more which I cannot leave unsaid, and then, by your patience, I will proceed with my story. 
                
               As they rode through that winding picturesque road; now startled by some bold mountain, rising like a giant, with outspread arms towards the sky; now soothed by the rippling of some rivulet playing by the roadside; or stilled by the roar of the dashing river, rushing far below their feet; or surprised at seeing a cottage with its signs of humble comfort, its green sward, and its goats, seemingly but a stone's throw from the edge of a fearful glacier; I say, as these shifting views were unfolded to their eyes, ever and anon there stole over the faces of both Walter and Edith a smiling expression so peculiar that it is almost impossible to describe or characterize it. 
               There was a wonderful similitude in their smile; but in neither did it resemble any look you could have found in the face of either before. It had a character of surprise in it, and it looked as though the mind was straining back into the fathomless depths of its oldest reminiscence; for there was a contracting of the brow-a drawing in of the breath; as if a phantom was passing, and a strong effort was made to rivet upon it the attention, so as to define it, delineate it, and chain it to the memory inextricably. Yet, as the features relaxed, and the smile diffused over the whole face, there was a glow of satisfaction; as if a missing clue, lost in the dark and groped after long in vain, had been picked up, and the way found once more again. 
               How shall I describe the passing emotions that broke out into this queer smile? I cannot. Neither Walter nor Edith could define satisfactorily that strange impression. Fancy and memory were playing such pranks, and had gotten so intertwisted, the two travellers felt as if they were passing through exactly the same scene, with time, place, person, all the same for the second time. The recognition was so perfect; and yet each knew it to be so utter an illusion; that this odd smile of wonder, incredulity, and indecision, was only a temporary concession of acknowledgment to the passing mirage. They knew perfectly well that all was new-that some secret, hidden analogy they could not trace suggested resemblances that subsisted from their very vagueness; but neither would wholly give up the phantasy. 
               Had they known how near their hearts were beating in harmony, at these moments, they might, perhaps, by the magnetism of mutual attention, have detected the secret of a phenomenon sometimes recognised, but never yet explained. This they did not do. Each felt a shadowy consciousness of something unaccountable, but each had learned to keep their thoughts at home, until they got shape and strength enough to stand or run alone. Thus the twain had all day sat unconsciously within the same enchanted circle; each had thoughts, impulses, and emotions starting from the same point, traversing the same track, and losing themselves in the indefiniteness of infinity in the same way, but never guessed the coincidence. 
               Nevertheless, all day long their hearts recognised each other, and if you had counted their pulses, you would have found a marvellous uniformity. Why was this? Did Walter Ashwood know by intuition that Edith Stirling could love him as he had dreamed he might be loved in his early days?-as Florence had loved him? Why did Edith hold her breath when Walter first approached her? Was it from a prophetic instinct that the ideal of her youthful fancy stood confessed before her? It was not love at first sight, but unconscious love without sight. How now, blind Cupid! Such was the lady beside whom Walter sat at breakfast, at the Hotel de Londres et d'Angleterre, in the valley of Chamounix, on the morning of that seventeenth day of August. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VII. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "I saw her bosom heave and swell, 
                           Heave and swell with inward sighs- 
                           I could not choose but love to see 
                           Her gentle bosom rise. 
                        
                         
                           Her wet cheek glowed: she stept aside, 
                           As conscious of my look she stepped; 
                           Then suddenly, with tim'rous eye, 
                           She flew to me and wept. 
                        
                         
                           She half enclosed me with her arms, 
                           She pressed me with a meek embrace; 
                           And bending back her head, looked up, 
                           And gazed upon my face. 
                        
                         
                           'Twas partly love, and partly fear, 
                           And partly 'twas a bashful art, 
                           That I might rather feel than see 
                           The swelling of her heart." 
                        
                      
                     S. T. COLERIDGE. 
                   
                
               THE plan for the day's diversion, proposed by the party to which Walter had attached himself, was to ascend the Breven, then cross over to the Flgere, and return to the Hotel the same evening. Several other ladies and gentlemen had originally formed part of the party, but some accident prevented them going. The scheme was about to be abandoned for the day; when upon consulting the guides (who are infallible here), the rare occurrence of so fine a day as promised, made it important, in their opinion, the occasion should be improved. Clouds and storms are so common here, that no guide (who is either conscientious or hungry) will let the traveller be idle in what they call a beau-temps. There were none ready to go but Edith and Walter. 
               In the hurry and excitement of getting mounted upon mules, and being armed with alpenstocks (to be carried in hand like javelins), and scolding the stupid guides in the worst French they could muster for the nonce, to make themselves comprehended, they set out upon their journey, and were well up the first steep, before it occurred to either that they were alone. They had ridden in the narrow bridle-path, and there had been no immediate opportunity for conversation. Soon, by a sharp turn in the road, they were brought almost face to face, and a pretty, but as yet limited glimpse up and down the valley was opened before them. 
               They both felt impressed with the beauty of that scene, as it lay thus unfolded, resting in the sweet dews and shadows of early morning, before the grandeur of the surrounding horizon began to press upon their attention. Each on the instant recognised, too, something in the countenance and look of the other that neither had observed before; and then came over the mind of each a causeless, sourceless feeling, as of overwhelming satisfaction. Yes, they were alone, and had this glorious day before them, amid these grand old mountains, to indulge in all the reveries, and, perhaps, to give vent to all the unsunned thoughts that, shut up, and wanting air, weigh upon the spirit or cloud the brain. 
               The looks so exchanged were such as do not fall to the lot of all: looks not easily appreciable by those whose experiences of life are simple and full of routine; looks that tell whole histories and make large prophecies in a second of time; looks that do not come often to us in a lifetime; looks that strike like basilisks if we fail to understand them-but which, when a sign and seal of mutual recognition, are so full charged with all that is magnetic in the human composition, as to send through the brain to the heart and back again, a thrill, in which joy and anguish are so inseparably mingled that the lips are dumb and the breath is held, as much from the apprehended uncertainty of the final issue, as from the intensity and suddenness of the emotion. 
               "What a charming morning!" said Edith, who was the first to recover self-possession and voice. "See how the mist rolls down the side of the mountain, and the sunlight breaks through here and there, dotting the valley with golden and silvery color. Who would think, looking down in this peaceful, rural, nestling village, that we were at the foot of the colossal snow-mountain that charms the world by its sublime and majestic beauty!" 
               There was a frankness, and confession of enthusiasm and impulsiveness, in Edith's manner as she spoke that a little startled herself; and she involuntarily paused, and shrank lest she had suffered some word to escape her that betrayed her emotion. She had spoken in fact with precision, but there was a little flutter in the tones of her voice that Walter's quick ear detected. He had made women so much his study, that he knew every note in that wonderful octave-a woman's voice. He felt in that instant the complete assurance of what he had indeed suspected for some seconds. He knew that, without the least intention of so doing, and with a general resolve not to suffer himself to seem or to be interested, he had struck a chord in the heart of his companion that vibrated with his look or his speech. He saw that impulse had broken through pride, womanly fear, and prudence; and had betrayed the secret that escaped almost before its first possessor was conscious of the possession. It was the first faint flash of very distant lightning, and none but a conductor of very delicate susceptibility would have felt the shock. 
               Walter, however, as we have seen, was not inexperienced. He had been many times the unexpecting recipient of sudden revelations; and it had been once his pride and guilty pleasure to sport and play with the tenderest sensibilities of the female heart. His skill and acumen were still his own, and he knew what sort of material he had to deal with at once. The old feeling of triumph and zest for his fiendish diversion revived for a moment; but it was the effect of habit, and was dead and gone before he could question or rebuke it. A new and strange feeling came over him, that he could not fathom or control. He was a little disturbed in that self-possession that had stood by him in the stormiest times, and upon occasions of displays of tremendous passion. He was, indeed, a little puzzled. 
               Hitherto, he had always a sure ally to steady his nerves and clear his judgment, whenever he had to meet this kind of encounter. Never before had it failed him. In all his experiences up to this hour (save only with Florence, whose case was exceptional, although not fully understood until too late), the first symptom of surrender had always chilled him into such an iceberg of indifference, that the love of an angel and the passion of a Sappho could not have thawed him. This had enabled him to pass unscathed through the most fiery ordeals. 
               It was strange how suddenly and surely all the budding symptoms of interest, sympathy, and affection, that sprang up in his heart (if he had one), would wither and die at the first show of the same sentiments towards him from a woman. Could they have come to maturity without this check, he might have loved and married, like a decent citizen, many years before; but, though possessing qualities which made him very attractive to women, he could not endure a recognition of the power or influence of these qualities. Whether this came from modest self-depreciation, or distrust of the worth of that which was given without asking, or want of confidence in the endurance of what seemed a hasty growth of impulsiveness, he often asked himself, but was never able satisfactorily to conjecture. In fact, it was from neither. It was rather from an acquired coldness of heart. This sprang up, in his hot impulsive nature-an ice plant in the tropics-from undeserved rebuffs to a precocious spontancity in early life; and, as I have attempted to relate, growing into a morbid suspicion of everything good, true, or beautiful in the moral world, at length it had become chronic, and froze the genial current of his soul. 
               The sufferings of the past night, he thought, might have unnerved him, and made him tremulous; for he answered Edith with emotion and moistened eyes-talking joyously of the beauty of the day and the hour and the scene. Without conscious effort, the chords of his tongue were loosened; and from that moment he talked throughout the day's journey as if sure of a kind and sympathizing listener. He felt he was dealing with one from whom no confession of weakness would bring contempt; and into whose presence he might bring the phantoms of his imagination or the vagaries of his reason, without being taken for a madman or a fool. In one word, he recognised one into whose ear he might pour, without stint, those torrents of egotism that sprang from every pore of the man; but which pride had compelled him to suppress with such detriment to his soul's health. 
               Whatever might have been a cause of this starting into new life, of an impulsiveness that had been smothered so many a weary year, he did not stop further to inquire. It was enough that it was spontaneous and genuine, and, under the new resolves of the previous night, he was content to trust it to time and circumstance, to guide and control it. What a concession to Truth and Nature for Walter Ashwood! 
               They talked together of their past lives, and of the strange events that had filled them. As they talked so freely and honestly, there would have been no lack of interest in the double narrative, even to a stranger's ears. All the while, each sedulously gathered together the fragments as they fell from the other, and pieced them into a figure consistent with a preconceived theory of the character of the speaker. Neither had much knowledge of the history of the other, except a vague outline filled in with what little had been learned in the previous day's travel. Still, either from wilful infatuation, or an instinctive appreciation, every fact that came out, every sentiment expressed, went to confirm the first idea and to strengthen the first impression. 
               As the power and intensity of the beauty of these proud old mountains and the far-winding valleys grew, the higher they climbed, their thoughts and the imagery with which they clothed them, seemed to partake of the character of what they saw. 
               Often and again did they stop, to the dismay of the guide, and linger lovingly over the wilderness of beauty far below their feet. At every bend in the path they found new views. Now in the distance would be seen a swelling form of cloud, piled behind a hoary mountain, that lay stretching its huge bulk in colossal indifference to all above, below, around, beneath: and then a misty shadow, from another point, would take upon itself a shape so distinct, rigid, sharp, and clean-cut against the clear sky, as to startle one who had not become quite familiar with its ghostly presence. Here the distant mountains, rising one above another, lay interlacing each other-slope lapping upon, slope, and mountain-top receding behind mountain-top. Between them stretched the valleys and ravines; some open to sunlight, and some dense in shadow as the cave of Erebus: all so intertwisted and interlocked in each other's embraces, that where mountain began or valley ended, no eye could rightly distinguish. 
               Looking away into these depths of space, and letting the eye ramble on, over these unending varieties of scene, a sense of serenity and of self-forgetfulness steals over the mind; until those higher thoughts that connect us with the past and the future, making our present existence appear but a link in a chain, rise and claim our attention. Then we seem lifted away from all that is common, actual, or tangible in our lives; and the abstract in thought and the fervid in emotion seem the only realities. 
               Onward they moved, up the steep declivity-now over a greensward, and now over rough stones-here by the edge of a precipice, and there upon the brink of a deep ravine-now in the shadow of the forest of evergreens, and now in the glare of glowing sunshine. The sky became intensely bright and clear above. Mont-Blanc began to soar up, and lift off the gauzy drapery from its snowy shoulders; while the glaciers, fed by its lavish overflow, descending from either side to the narrow plain below, became distinct in their waving outlines. Then, there lay the pretty valley of Chamouny, with its green and brown rectangular fields, far, far below: between the very jaws of the monster Ice-king that reigns here, resting in secure repose, upon the strength of its own weakness; and provoking magnanimity by its trustfulness. 
               How often on that day, Walter essayed in vain, to give expression before Edith, to some profound emotion that stirred him, as these ravishing views changed, dissolved, and re-formed before him, I may not attempt to tell. Truth to say, it was not seldom-when he thought he could give form and language to some old fancy of his youth, or some darling hope that was intertwisted with his boyish associations; and had been kept locked in a secret hiding-place so long that the key was lost, and the clue forgotten-that, despite his new-found frankness and sincerity, his words failed, or his tongue refused to utter them. These thick-coming fancies sometimes filled his eyes with tears, that came scalding upon his cheeks, as if they had burned their way out. At other times, the huskiness, of his voice showed him that to speak, would, too much betray him; as he felt something now drawing the very blood from his heart, or now pressing a tightening finger upon his throat. Often, indeed, on that day did he feel with the poet- 
                      
                        "Could I embody and unbosom now 
                        That which is most within me-could I wreak 
                        My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw 
                        Soul, heart, mind, passions, feeling, strong or weak, 
                        All that I would have sought and all I seek, 
                        Bear, know, feel, and yet breathe-into one word, 
                        And that one word were Lightning, I would speak; 
                        But as it is, I live and die unheard, 
                        With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword." 
                     
                  
                   At times, however, as it were, all the ice that had gathered for years, in the deep sunless abysses of his nature, was thawed into a flood, and the foundations of the great depths within him were unpheaved, and shifting like quicksands. When his tongue was thus loosened, and an assurance came to him, that his words sank into the willing ear of Edith; and that he was comprehended and that what he had resisted was felt to be of as much significance as what he had done; and that he was addressing, a judgment that borrowed wisdom from charity, and heard the whole story: then it was he talked long and earnestly; and with a fervor of enthusiasm, that while it riveted the attention of his listener the more, constantly startled her by the suddenness or the strangeness of his self-revelations. 
               Now let us turn, and see what was passing in the mind of Edith. She had loved her husband, as a young girt loves the first bright vision that hovers over her youthful imagination, earnestly and passionately-but not always so. She had married her first-love. Her power of loving had just unfolded its new leaves, and spread its young blossoms to the sun. Before it had learned its strength, or begun to know the wealth of its voluptuousness, She, with that gushing generousness of impulse, that always was overflowing in her oriental nature, had showered its budding glories upon the first medium of its recognition. When the glow of youthful ardor passed away; when the happy twain began to look into each other's hearts, her husband found all his soul's desire; and rested his loving head on that gentle bosom trustingly, through his brief life. His nature required but little of that glowing sympathy; and felt but little of that instinctive grasping after a recognition of the soul's similitude, and that intense thirst for fellowship in emotions too secret and sacred to be shared except by the mutually enthusiastic; which, overflowing in her nature like a river, had, through life, cost her effort and discipline, anguish and torment, sometimes almost beyond the point of endurance, to keep in check, and pent within its banks. 
               She had, however, borne her lot cheerfully; and without a murmur, that could disturb the happiness or equanimity of him she had sworn to honor. And when death took him to an early grave, she closed, with a peaceful and approving conscience, and with a stricken heart, those eyes whose last looks were full of grateful love and tender solicitude, for the faithful and true wife that he had delighted to cherish. So he had faded away and sunk into the past, and never knew, and had no power to know, the rich treasure that had lain heaped up profusely before him. Nay, although unseen hands had beckoned him to come to it, and her moist eyes had bent unceasingly over him, still he had slept on in life, almost as in death, in peaceful unconsciousness of the pangs and aches of the unsatisfied heart that throbbed so near him. 
               Some years had passed. At first sorrow weighed her to the earth. True, she had never found in her husband all her nature craved; but now she had lost all she had. She felt the crush of her great affliction, and the utter disruption of all that was fixed and established in her life and hope. She thought, like so many before her, that Death had been partial and malicious, and had taken the unwilling and left the willing. She felt she could not, and wished she might not, survive. She sought refuge now in solitude, and then in occupation; sometimes in tearful retrospection, and sometimes in prayer. It was only in the last that she found strength, peace, and purification. When she felt, as of a real presence, that her tottering Steps were sustained by an over-ruling Hand, and that His love and mercy were attributes to which she might appeal trustingly, the petty troubles of her own life seemed to melt away; and she was lifted into a horizon that overlooked untried fields, far reaching rivers, distant mountains, and almost a new world beyond. 
               As time wore on, she had assumed a calm, and then a gay and sparkling manner-softened however with an indescribable charm, that only comes from much knowledge gained, and much sorrow mastered; and is tempered by a love of humanity and a joyous nature. 
               How then can I suitably tell what was passing in the mind of Edith? With, what language can I tell how there had dawned upon her, from the first, an unacknowledged recognition of a nature of very great capabilities in depth of feeling, in breadth of vision, and in high imaginative appreciation of all those great well-springs of love and joy, that so teemed in her as to seem to envelope her in a warm mist, but which can not be made vocal? With what words can I describe how the emotion, that sprang unbidden in her breast, had grown against her resolve, and at length mastered her; so that she was ready to give prudence and womanly pride to the winds, and tell Walter how dearly she loved him, and how thoroughly she knew all of him, as he had been, and was, and could be-not by a historical process, but by an instinct that was a part of herself, and whose teachings, with her, were as absolute as the Two Tables? 
               No one should attempt to draw this picture. To those who would believe it, as within the range of human experience, there could be nothing half so vivid as their, own thoughts and memories will easily conjure from what I have suggested; while to those who do not and could not believe, it would seem so overstrained and high-fantastical, as, perhaps, to excite contempt. 
               At length our lovers (for we may hide under no more thin disguises) reached the plateau near the top of the Breven, where stands the little chalet; and invites man, and mule, and guide to rest. It had been a toilsome journey, and the heat of the day had been oppressive; but they had been so buoyed up by excitement, that their fatigue was not felt. They walked about for some time upon that vantage-ground of Nature, and drank their fill of its wondrous beauty; until the scene must have been stamped indelibly upon their recollection. No picture can give it, no description can tell it. This must not only be seen, but felt, to be known. 
               Some expressions had passed the lips of Walter that left Edith nothing to guess if that had been her cue or she had needed the poor aid of the ear to detect love. Walter too, with that power of which he had often felt the proof, knew all that passed in the heart of Edith; as well as if it were cased in amber, and its emotions named and colored like the currents, seas, and rivers upon a map. 
               So, when they sat down in that poor hovel of a chalet, and, feeling the lassitude of fatigue, tasted the generous wine of France; and then looked lovingly through the open windows out upon the glorious expanse of mountain and valley, river, ice, and snow before them; and watched the ever-varying shadows of mountain and cloud, and saw stretching far away into dim infinity those endless valleys of mist and darkness; while arose, high above all, that grand dome of Mont-Blanc, flashing in the bright day, as it raised its beautiful crest into the loving caress of the bluest of skies and the whitest of fleecy clouds-then and there it was they began to talk fully, frankly, and freely of love. 
               All the scroll of the past, with its scarred face, was unrolled: and faults, sins, and sorrows were scanned and judged so tenderly and mercifully, and yet so justly, that, while judgment and reason were satisfied, self-love was not hurt, and mutual love found, in mutual weakness, a tie, that bound their hearts far stronger than if all the cardinal virtues had been twisted into a single strand, and held them tethered. They talked of love for hours, and ages might have passed. 
               As they pressed up the further abrupt precipices, and at length gained the sharp rocky summit, and looked into the far distance, upon that terribly beautiful horizon, all the past seemed swept away, and the future bright and clear. Then and there, too, so many thousand feet in the air, with all the natural loveliness of the world, as it appeared, spread out beneath their feet, under the arch of the softest of skies, in the face of that sleeping miracle of pure virgin Beauty, rising like an exhalation above all but the heavens, they talked only of their new-found love, and vowed it should be eternal. 
               Then all the iron selfishness of Walter's nature fused. In that gorgeous palace of Nature, his human heart vindicated itself. 
                      
                        "The clouds were touched, 
                        And in their silent faces did he read 
                        Unutterable love. Sound needed none, 
                        Nor any voice of joy; his spirit drank 
                        The spectacle: sensation, soul, and form 
                        All melted into him; they swallowed up 
                        His animal being; in them did he live, 
                        And by them did he live; they were his life. 
                         
                        In such access of mind, in such high hour 
                        Of visitation from the living God, 
                        Thought was not; in enjoyment it expired. 
                        No thanks he breathed, he proffered no request; 
                        Rapt into still communion that transcends 
                        The imperfect offices of prayer and praise, 
                        His mind was a thanksgiving to the Power 
                        That made him; it was blessedness and love." 
                     
                  
                
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VIII. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "But am I not the nobler through thy love? 
                           O three times less unworthy! likewise thou 
                           Art more through Love, and greater than thy years. 
                           The sun will run his orbit, and the moon 
                           Her circle. Wait and Love himself will bring 
                           The drooping flower of knowledge changed to fruit 
                           Of wisdom. Wait! my faith is large in Time, 
                           And that which shapes it to some perfect end." 
                        
                      
                     TENNYSON. 
                   
                
               "WERE you ever before so elevated?" said Walter to Edith. 
               "Indeed, I never before felt so lofty; but I have lost the dizzy sensation that overwhelms me at a common height, and feel less the apprehension of toppling down than of being drawn up. My pulses are usually faster even than most of my sex; but an exhilaration unusual, to-day almost gives me the sense of wings. This mountain atmosphere always brings my capacities for enjoyment to their keenest edge. It appears to me, however, now, that the mere consciousness of existence, without a thought beyond the instant, is happiness enough, and as much as my soul can contain. This blue arch; this limitless horizon; this scene infinitely varying from sublime to beautiful that fills my eye on every side; this bright day; this cool breeze that so gently kisses the rude brow of this darling old Breven; the glow of blood and bounding spirits that I feel from the clambering of these steep rocks; the thrill that creeps through me, looking at those glorious old snow-gods, or letting my eye fall into that sweet valley, and thinking of those cool glaciers that I see creeping at its side-and, too, let me say it, the thought of you, all so overwhelm me, that I cling nervously to each second of time, as not willing to trust to the chance, that the delicious sensations of this minute will be continued or repeated in the next. But, my fathers! what an endless sentence! Whither am I letting my giddy tongue rattle to-day?" 
               "Pray, do not check yourself; you have a woman's privilege, you know, of talking nonsense when you choose, and of changing your opinion as often as it suits you. I like you the better for speaking frankly at once, what is uppermost in your mind as it passes; whether it would agree with your second thoughts or not; and if you'll not be offended I'll tell you the reason." 
                
               "You have so schooled me to listening to impudent speeches to-day, that I should not do credit to my training, if I rebelled. You have this day told me of some of my faults; and by a word, perhaps sometimes unintentionally, brought me more self-reproach than ever it was my lot before to bear in five years' time. And yet I don't know why, I like you too all the better." 
               "My dear Mrs. Sterling, you have made so many words that I quite forgot, until you stopped, of what I had been speaking; and you open up a subject that involves a world of talk. But, before I forget it, let me tell you why I like you the better, for speaking out what occurs to you, as you first think it. One reason then is, because, if you don't speak it at once you'll soon forget it, and it is lost to me for ever. But really I do not mean to disparage your mode of ratiocination. The difference between your sex and mine, in this respect, is, after all, more formal than substantial and real. You speak your first thoughts, and get repute for shallow judgment. We conceal our first thoughts, and wait till reflection enables us to select, from all our thoughts, those most worthy. 
               "There is only one little observation to be added (I hope you will not think it malicious), and that is, women, generally being satisfied with the expressing of their first idea, dismiss the matter from their minds. Whenever the subject is presented a second time, it is as fresh and novel, as a short memory and a superficial judgment can make it. Thus women are not apt to be embarrassed by a previously expressed opinion. A man whose opinions lack consistency is adjudged a fool. But, consistency in the expression of abstract opinion, is not an inexorable necessity to a very sensible, good, and lovable woman. This is what I mean to say, merely of the different use of the reasoning faculties, by men and women, as applied to one extreme of the scale of human thinking-to wit abstract opinion: but very much the same observation may be applied to their respective thoughts, all the way down the line of thought, to the very verge of whim and fancy. Only, as you descend, the subject diminishing in importance, and calling for less of that slowest combination of faculties-judgment; your first thought is more likely to be right as exhausting the subject at a stroke, and often far quicker than anything mere manly faculties can accomplish. But I plainly see, you are an unbeliever." 
               "Oh no, I am only a little sad-you-see. Indeed, I have half a mind to be offended, sir, at the low estimate you put upon women." 
               "Do not say 'woman,' but woemen. I am, as I have already told you in a hundred ways, a devoted admirer of woman. I do not believe her capabilities for self-enjoyment, or for contributing to the happiness of others, have been developed, to any degree approaching their limits. Men are interesting to each other, and often to women, chiefly in proportion as they are trained, educated, accomplished, tried, and disciplined: then why should women be expected to be so, spontaneously? True; women attract by their beauty, manner, taste, grace, and elegant accomplishments; and the world has got on very well, and the fears of Malthus have thus far proved to have been premature. Yet what oceans of misery and hate, might be turned into floods of love and happiness, if society expected and demanded of a woman, that she should strive to be fitted, and to fit herself, for doing and to do, to the extent of her capacity, her duty in life, as inexorably as it does exact it of a man! Do not misunderstand me. I never mean to say one word disparagingly of woman. God forbid that I should! I owe them too much. Perhaps I have wronged them too much." 
                
               "You talk very beautifully about them, and I am sure my sex thanks you. Still, I sometimes fancy you have never known what it was, to have a discriminating and appreciating friend among your female acquaintances: one who could at the same time see your merits, and your failings, as you call them; and, while appreciating the strength and clearness of your intellect, who could fully enter into and sympathize with your delicate perception of the endless shades of distinction you recognise in thought, character, and opinion, and your enthusiasm about ideas that, lying deeply embedded in events, are so far beyond the range of common observation. You present yourself in so many phases. You seem, in character, as in mental and moral endowments, to have so much of the Goethe-like 'many-sidedness,' that, if I did not know I loved you with the whole strength of my being, I should wonder if I really understood you." 
               "You have, perhaps, made a virtue of a weakness. What you are pleased so laudatorily to say of me, I should not, perhaps, hear without a protest; but as it falls from the lips of love, and with no other listener than the Heaven above us, that knows better, I am silent. Still I ought to suggest that perhaps I am 'many-sided,' as you say, because I lack the power to mould and fuse all these elements to unity. That is my own conviction. Nevertheless, with more than feminine sagacity you have come very near a great truth; and a key to much that seems confused, eccentric, and irreconcilable in my conduct, as well as in my opinions, and in my mode of expressing them. 
               "No, my dear Mrs. Sterling, I never had that friend of whom you speak until now. I never did attempt to show every side, or the whole of my character, to any one human being, until now. I never found the vessel, I believed large enough to contain all I wished to pour into it, until now. You have talked to-day of my modesty, and diffidence, and self-depreciation. It is true only of what I have been and am: but when I touch upon what I believe myself to have been capable of, my imagination reaches up like yonder snowy, cloud-capped mountain, and my self-conceit swells into such ungovernable pride, that it is perhaps fortunate I never had such a one; unto whom I might have spoken very freely and very fully, or my sanity would have been doubted. Indeed, I have never before found the one being, to whom I felt I could reveal myself, without passing for a madman or a fool. My intercourse with men and women, so far as self-revelation is concerned, has been very fragmentary and scrappy. They have had merely a little glimpse to this one, and a side-view to that one; just as much only as I was sure each could bear, but a modicum of what I had to deliver. I sometimes think this has engendered that peculiarity you remark upon, and call many-sidedness." 
               "Oh, Walter, you make me so proud and happy. It seems to me too much happiness, to be able thus to fathom and become the recipient of your thoughts. You are to me the one, my heart has been seeking after and yearning for, all my life long. My married life was thought by the world to be a very happy one. It was crowned with garlands of flowers, and had every mark of prosperity: but though I strove to do my duty as a wife, and believe I did, and was very greatly beloved, I always felt that I was marching through life like a soldier in the ranks, without volition of my own-guided by a destiny I could not control, and resolved to die in the harness; but indifferent where or how soon. And yet, Walter, all the while I recognised within myself an impetuousness which, once let loose, could never be restrained; and a capacity for out-reaching sympathies that lay far beyond the scope of my daily life. What it was which gave me assurance to declare myself to you to-day, I know not: but even now, while I talk with you, I fancy myself again and again reviving some vivid memory of the past, of which all details are gone, while the impression is distinct; and I seem to myself not only to fully comprehend you, but always to have known you." 
               "I hope I shall not offend you, Edith, if I say, I wonder not a little at your taking for granted the possibility of second love. I have been taught to believe the doctrine that once in love is always in love-whether the object be present or absent-whether here in this world, or dwelling in Heaven. Of course I refer to reciprocated, consummated, married-love. None other is truly tried, or deserving to be counted, in arriving at the rule or law upon the subject. There is much, you know, passing for love in this world, that dies for lack of fuel, before such consummation, or expires with it. There is love that is so deliberate, that it freezes to death by the wayside; and there is impulsive love, that shows a hasty spark, and straight is cold again. But I speak now of fervent, honored, trusted, and worthy love. If one has truly loved, and been beloved by a husband or wife, how can that love expire or give way to a fresh passion? Is not this life a mere link in the chain of existence? Shall we not live hereafter in continuation of our existence here? Does not our beloved await us in Heaven? How shall we frankly meet that one hereafter? Can one love two at the same time? Shall we have such duality in Heaven? Shall we not play false, to one or the other, if we suffer ourselves to believe we have capabilities of a second love? 
               "Understand me, Edith, I do not speak of second-marriages, merely as marriages: they are common enough, and most people are capable enough of them. Though it is true that Love is either a puny, sickly baby, or a most troublesome and ungovernable tyrant, if there be not marriage as its ultimate result; yet there is no end of marriages which are not the result of love, as we are now contemplating it and speaking of it. Perhaps you may take exception to what I say, about love without marriage being a sorry affair. My remark is the result of no little observation-is candid, too-and, I am satisfied, well founded. I will give you at once the key, to all the facts, you know, which seem to contradict it. It is this. Where there exists a relationship between man and woman, which you imagine to be love without marriage, examine it very closely; and, my life for it, you will find one of two things: either you will find man gives his friendship
                   in exchange for woman's love, or you will find a marriage in fact-morganatic or otherwise. So much for Platonic love!" 
               "Really, Walter, you set so many thoughts spinning through my brain, I am half giddy. I look around to find something real to cling to. As I look far down upon that miniature carpet so many thousand feet below us, I wonder if I can gather something of space and scope, from the wide scene, to encourage me to undertake to tell you what I have thought of all these things. The only practical answer to your distracting questions was given by our Saviour-that in Heaven 'there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage:' but, to quote one of your own mocking expressions, as that was before the age of chivalry, they never thought to ask Him, and He never told, if there was LOVING in Heaven. How then shall I answer you? Do you ask my reason? That is unfair. I am, as you say, 'a woman.' It is our privilege to keep our reasons to ourselves and give you only our conclusions. Indeed, I have heard say, this was the judicious policy of some very profound men. We do it of right, and without policy. I would rather hear you talk of it than try to give you my ideas. They are not precisely clear to myself, in all things, on this matter. I feel, perhaps haps, more than I reason. All I know is, that I feel myself now, more capable of loving earnestly with my whole nature, than ever. Why is this? Am I disloyal to the grave? Perhaps you will explain my thoughts to myself better than I can. Pray tell me more fully what you think of it." 
               "Well then, my dear Mrs. Sterling, to be very philosophical, I do think it is an intricate matter, that can never find a successful solution, except as each mind finds it, and makes its own law for itself. I do not believe that any conjecture, or any reasoning  priori (if you will excuse the phrase), can ever satisfy. Nor do I think any deduction, based upon assumed facts, can be of substantial value; for the simple reason, that the facts can never be known in sufficient force, to justify a reliable conclusion. Let us see. Those alone who should know, either do not have sufficient self-knowledge to tell all the truth; or, from motives of self-protection, will not tell it frankly and reliably. Thus everybody must find the law for themselves; and, if they deal honestly with themselves, and do not suffer passion or convenience to betray or delude them, they will generally find their own law within themselves. Of course, I cannot speak from my own experience; but I will tell you the views I heard expressed the other day by a friend, himself a widower; who with myself passed a delightful half-day riding by coach from Zurich to Ardt, on our way to ascend the Righi. The lovely scenery was suggestive of all that is tender and beautiful; and my friend was unusually frank, genial, and communicative. 
               "The substance of my friend's theory ran somewhat thus: 'That very few, in this world, really do ever love to the utmost of their earthly capacity; that most people marry before they have met that special individual who has power to draw forth all, or even nearly all their capabilities of loving; that accident, blind contact, the strong necessity of loving, and policy, make almost all marriages; that there is very little free-will in any (the will being none the more free, because it is insensibly guided by an invisible combination of circumstances, over which the will exercises no control); that very often, before love is fully developed on either side, it is discovered on the one side or the other (when it is too late to recant), that the fancied quality, sympathy, power, or susceptibility that was loved had no real existence, and was only the cheating illusion of a too willing imagination. Assuming all this to be true,' my friend then urged, 'the question becomes narrowed to a matter of very small importance; and the true answer to the question, of the possibility of second love (as a practical matter, and as affecting all of the race, with a few exceptions), is that-second love, as generally understood, is not only possible and practicable, but is common and necessary, and rather, the rule of human intercourse, than the exception. For,' said he, 'second love generally, thus it seems, is only second in the order of time: and, to a man or woman of sound understanding, of honest heart, and of enthusiastic, susceptible, God-loving soul, who has preserved unhackneyed and untarnished the instincts of youth; second love is quite likely to be first in depth, sincerity, and truth; and perhaps, indeed, first in fact in any aspect. But,' he further insisted, 'where first love is that true love which has called forth all the faculty of loving; and has been worthily bestowed, and has been consummated by marriage, no second love is reliable. In truth, a second love of such an one,' he solemnly protested, 'would be so false and disloyal to the first, as to render the evidence of both equivocal and suspicious. The soil,' said he, 'is exhausted, and the soul must wait until the links of its existence are reunited in Heaven. Nay, more,' said my Romeo, 'any sentiment, passion, or outgoing of the affections; after the loss of the object of such a love, might reach the highest development of friendship, but it would involve a confusion of ideas to call it Love.' 
               "That was the pith of his talk. My friend's theory, you will perceive, has one important element of popularity in it. Its exceptions are so wide and so numerous, that it adapts itself to everybody's case; and if judiciously applied may relieve every one from the reproach of inconsistency." 
               "Yes, Walter, but the soothing remedy supplied by such a theory must be sometimes a very mortifying one. I don't adopt it. I believe we are living here to be happy; and that God, who does not delight to make us miserable, takes away the sting of sorrow, after we have gained the benefit of the probation-and gives us new capacity for enjoyment, although our affliction was so sore, we believed the power of receiving happiness to be dead within us. Having but one life to live, and that a short one; I believe useless and perpetual repining for the inevitable past, is neither a duty nor a virtue. I see much disrespect for the living, and no real respect for the memory of the dead in that. I think we may safely leave, the disposition of love and marriage, in the next world, to the hands of Providence. As my bible teaches me, and prayer-book explains to me, second marriages imply second love; and, not only, are neither prohibited, but both are, at least indirectly, countenanced by one of the Apostles, and by the Saviour himself." 
               Edith paused, almost abruptly, as if startled by the boldness of her speech. It would be a vain and profitless task in me to attempt to record the random talk that flowed from the lips of the lovers; as they sat long, and unheeding the lapse of time, among these splendid palaces and temples of Nature, or as they journeyed over these lovely mountains this bright August day. Many a theme did they discuss; often with as wide difference of opinion and sentiment, as their lives and experiences had lain wide asunder. There was, however, an earnestness, and a striving after the truth, that had become so essential a part of their mutual treatment of each other, that, although Walter was, ever and anon, lapsing into his old habit of sneering irony, and Edith was gushing with a love of humanity, that often startled herself, still their minds met fairly. Looking into each other's eyes they seemed to say; "We speak exactly what we think, and exactly what we mean-let us have no disguises, no excess, no abatement: we pledge ourselves that each shall be to the other a second self." 
                
               And then, there was between them, that total absence of any effort at proselytism to opinion, which is essential to all good conversation. Indeed, each recognised in the expressed opinions of the other a sincerity, deserving of profound respect and kind consideration. Nay, although Edith felt a constant inclination to yield her opinions to those of Walter, and although the smothered impetuosity of his nature sometimes flamed up as if it would devastatingly carry all before it yet; he would soon recover himself, and so gently retrace his steps, and indeed, so soothingly and encouragingly, with such discriminating and deferential touch, dress up her thoughts, that they came out brighter from the struggle, and seemed never before, to have had such show of reason, and such a right to her ready and hearty adoption. 
               How should I portray all the moving panorama of beauty, that passed before their eyes? With what diction shall I record, how all the wells of poetical imagery and association, in the depths of richly-laden memory flowed out in fullest freshness? My confessionary pen refuses to write, how the thoughts of youth and the by-gones of pleasure and sadness, all came bubbling up from the depths of overstrained hearts; and often broke over the lips, as our travellers passed these rocky steeps, or beside these deep ravines, or through these narrow passes, or upon the brink of the dread precipices, while crossing over from the Breven to the Flgere? 
               Let us pause, however, for a moment. In front of the little chalet, lying in the lap of the Flgere, Walter stopped, almost transfixed. For some time he stood, upon a little rocky platform there, as if paralysed. Never could Edith forget his manner of speaking of that scene. This spot, indeed, at once fixed itself upon his attention, with a terrible fascination. The mountain rises high at your back; and, above the grassy or wooded declivity, vault up innumerable sharp, barren peaks of splintered rock, piercing the very sky. On every side mountain and valley, of vast extent spring out; that have now grown familiar, from the day's acquaintance. In front of you is a grand and terrific view of the Mer-de-glace, seen from a distance, and of the path cloven in the mountain down which it comes. The barren sides, of the channel of its resistless track, rise to a fearful height. The Mer-de-glace itself-with its engulphing width; its perhaps thousand feet of depth of thick-ribbed ice; its scarred, seamed, fissured, and ugly surface, and its many miles in length-opens, threateningly wide, its horrid jaws, against the very bosom of the meek valley of Chamouny. The ice is dark, and a gloom and mist seem to hang over the dread spot, as if it were the abode of some monster, whose baleful breath filled that roofless cavern, with a poisonous exhalation. "It looks," said Walter, "like the very gateway of Hell itself; yawning wide to destroy and devour. That look of barrenness, desolation, infinite sterility, and repulsion, is awful to contemplate. Lauterbrunnen, Grindelwald, and the Bay of Uri are lovely in their sublimity; but the valley of the Mer-de-glace, seen from this spot upon the Flgere, is sublimely hideous. It is impossible to associate one idea of beauty with it. It is too horrible!" Edith shuddered, as she saw the terrible earnestness with which Walter spoke. 
               The sun was quite low; and our ramblers were very tired and very hungry, when they returned to the hotel. A substantial repast awaited them; and, with generous dishes and pleasant wines, they were enabled to repair some of the ravages of the day's fatigue. 
               Many regrets they heard, from their friends who had remained behind. Some easy souls, however, got so familiar with the scenes, from the enthusiastic description given them by the adventurers, that they took them at second-hand, and were quite satisfied, and saved themselves the fatigue of seeing at all. 
                
               When the curiosity of friends had subsided, Edith and Walter sat by the open window; and, secure by the gurgling of the noisy little Arve from being overheard, they talked of love and the future; and as they parted with a wish of, "good night," there went bounding through the brain and blood of both an unworded prayer, and conviction too, that the book of the past might be closed, and the promises of youth trusted in the future once more and for ever. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER IX. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "Alas, that love should be a blight and snare 
                           To those that seek all sympathies in one!- 
                           Such once I sought in vain; then black despair, 
                           The shadow of a starless night, was thrown 
                           Over the world in which I moved alone:- 
                           Yet never found I one not false to me, 
                           Hard hearts, and cold, like weights of icy stone 
                           Which crushed and withered mine, that could not be 
                           Aught but a lifeless clog, until revived by thee." 
                        
                      
                     SHELLEY. 
                   
                
               THE next day it rained dismally. Some say it always rains at Chamouny. It began in the night, and had continued to pour down in streams that rivalled mountain-torrents. It rained incessantly. The sky was densely black, and unwilling to let daylight through. It came very tardily; and then the clouds, lifting themselves for a moment so as to look thinner, fell back more opaque and hopeless than before. But something resembling daylight did come at last. The rain kept on. Chamouny has a world-wide fame for rain; and it was worthy of its reputation on this occasion. Tourists were dumb in despair. The forlorn-looking and disconsolate guides hung about the dripping doorways; or sat in the entries of the houses, looking anxiously at every break in the clouds, and sullenly waiting for the river to run dry; that was pouring itself into their devoted valley. The hotel-keepers alone looked resigned and cheerful. 
               Edith came late to breakfast, and sat long over it. She was very pale, and ate but little. Walter had left the table before she came down. He looked particularly easy and happy. The mauvais-temps had not dampened his spirits at all. He recognised in the power he had exercised over Edith nothing but good. If he felt any self-gratulation, at the facility with which she had been led to give up her heart's mystery to his master-key, it was a momentary effect of habit, and not a permanent or dominant feeling. Indeed, an absolute revolution had taken place in his character and principles. At length he had found one who could comprehend him-to whom he could talk. He was not afraid to unmask himself to Edith. He felt he could throw off all disguise; and show himself almost as he was in fact, without fear of forfeiting her love. 
               There was too a dawning sentimentality in his thoughts and feelings, that had lain buried underneath the lumber of the half-atheistic and half-heathen philosophy of his self-discipline, for many years. Hitherto he had sought pleasure, in order to avoid retrospection. He had found much in the past to regret, and he had turned away from it. His love for Edith seemed to reconcile him to himself. His self-dissatisfaction was passing away. His self-love was growing. He felt, he knew not why, the secret satisfaction that is felt by one who is conscious of having done a good action, without expectation of reward, or recognition. He was certainly very deeply in love at last; and to his entire surprise (when he thought of it in this way), it made him very happy and cheerful, and, if I might use the expression, morally salubrious. 
               Not so, however, with Edith. Upon her, love was producing some opposite effects. She had not slept well. The night had been very long, and the storm very dreary. She could not, at first, tell precisely why, but she was ill at ease. She felt that she should be happy. She loved, and was beloved, sincerely and earnestly. Why then was she disturbed? Why was she sad? She had moved so rapidly, in her thoughts and feelings, for the last two days, that events prior to them had faded into the far-distant past. 
                
               She had unlocked the casket of her soul, and poured out all its wealth at the feet of her idol without stint, and without reflection. Did she regret? Had she lost the sense of womanly reserve, that is the charmed panoply, protecting her sex from the approach of evil? Had she spoken too freely to Walter? Might he not misjudge her? She knew him to be a gentleman, in the sense that word is understood, among men of honor. She knew her character and person were safe. She could not doubt the sincerity of his love. But whither had she drifted? 
               The more she tried to grasp Walter as a fact, the more he floated away as a phantom or an abstraction. What would be the upshot of this love? Would he marry her? Truly of herself (reckless impersonation of passion!) she cared not. So she was dearly loved by such a man, little she recked whither she drifted, or upon what rocks she wrecked. Conscience and reason were so thoroughly put to sleep by passion; that wife or mistress was all one to her. Still she had relatives, friends, position, prestige; and if prudery were necessary to them, why a prude she must and would be. 
               Was Walter a man who would marry? This was a recurring question to her mind; and yet, at times, she felt as though she could sink into the earth for very shame at the weakness of such an anxiety. Really she did not care; she only feared that if he would not marry, he might, from sentiments of honor, cease to know her. Surely Walter had given her a different impression, from what she might have derived, upon a literal reading of the facts of his history. But I believe she was right. Walter did love truly at last, and with fervency and devotion. 
               Then there was another subject of disquietude, not easily ignored. Edith had left Paris hastily to come to Switzerland. She was certainly a pretty woman, and of course had many admirers in Paris. Among the number Eugene Thornton had met her more often than any other. Indeed her heart was not wholly unpreoccupied, when she met Walter-but the stars went out at sunrise. 
               She had been some years a widow, and had grown tired; and had fretted somewhat under the annoyances to which, as a "charming widow," she had been subjected. She had beauty, manner, cultivation, position, and fortune. When did such a woman lack followers, and persecutors? Thornton had known her in America; soon after the night of widowhood had set upon her young heart and hope. He had then shown her much kindness and sympathy. At such a time, strange to say, the sensitive mind and heart are open to very mysterious impressions. The entangling sympathies, which find root in the morbid sensibility that overtakes weak human nature on such occasions, are near akin to love. Long afterwards, with these prepossessions, Thornton had met Edith in Paris. What wonder then if she leaned towards him, without exactly knowing why; or much thinking of any consequences? 
               Eugene Thornton was tall, slender, fresh-complexioned; with curling chestnut hair, a beautiful mouth, and soft brown eyes, ever smiling-as pleasant, handsome a fellow as you would meet in a summer's day. He was born of American parents, resident in Paris, and had been educated in part at Geneva and in part in England: besides spending a few years in the land of his fathers. He was a man of many accomplishments; and further, he had a natural gentleness and facility of disposition, that carried him through all the phases, changes, and chances of life, without making much impression upon him. He had reached near to forty, and was fresh as at thirty. Life had flowed so smoothly and calmly, that time had written no wrinkles on his brow. 
               Edith's self-possessed air and elegant manner had attracted him. He found many sympathies in common between them. He believed she would make him a happy wife; and upon this notion he had at times pressed his attentions with some ardor. Edith liked him very much. She did not disguise this. She had believed herself almost loving him; but it had subsided into a subdued sisterly affection. They had, indeed, a sort of undefined understanding between themselves; while those who troubled their heads to speak or think about it (as few did in Paris) set them down as "engaged." 
               Eugene was one who would never break his heart for any woman. But he had that vanity and love of adventure so common with men, which would give him pleasure in marring the happiness of a rival. Edith never quite understood him. There was a depth and fire of passion in her blood, and a profound undercurrent of reckless earnestness in her character; which did not always show itself, but which made it difficult for her to comprehend those who had neither. She could not well believe that lips could profess so much as Thornton's, and the heart be so much in subjection to the will. Thus she often mistook those qualities, which would make him simply troublesome to a rival, for real devotion to herself. 
               All these things ran through her mind now. Why had she not thought of them sooner? Was she demented mented? What tornado had passed over and obliterated her former self? What Lethean wave had swept over her? Truth to say; she had forgotten Thornton for the last three days, as utterly as if he had never been. Inconstant woman! Here was a dilemma. Her sudden and inconsiderate love for Walter puzzled her. It was indeed a case of trance and affinity. Let the Free-Lovers help her out of it! 
               True, she had not, latterly, felt any very fervent or passionate interest in Thornton. Still, her mind and heart having no fixed preoccupation, he had been a constant guest to her thoughts: and he had received such encouragement as a true woman finds it very difficult to revoke. That morning she had received letters from Thornton, brimful of love, and assuming a state of things between him and herself that frightened her. It was her first written communication from him since leaving Paris. Hitherto, she really had not known, as she had not cared, how far she had become entangled. Now, however, it was a serious matter. 
               As the two images incessantly rose and faded before her, she was perplexed in the extreme. What would Thornton do? What would Walter do? What should she do? How should she answer Thornton's notes? How should she meet Walter? Must she be a hypocrite? She had but one solitary shadow upon her whole life, and that she had guarded so zealously, the fame of it-a mere contradicted rumor-had never crossed the ocean. She had always shrunk from the least show of duplicity, and now she was getting involved in a maze from which she could find no egress. She had been all the livelong morning thinking, as she styled it. All the previous night she had been troubled by some distressing foreboding, to which she could give no definite shape; and with morning came Eugene's letters, and then she began to think.
                
               Does anybody, except a woman, know what a woman does, when she "thinks?" Facts are not collected or compared; ideas are not analysed or tested; analogies are not drawn; precedents are not referred to; axioms are not relied upon; conclusions are not sought after. Still she thinks. Can any woman tell what she thinks, or what she is thinking of? Is not the state of her understanding like that of the eye, looking at the shifting combinations of the kaleidoscope? Does she do more than recognise a constantly changing commixture of ideas; without having the least notion whence they came, or whither they go? Does she not keep on, as it were, turning the instrument until, at random, she strikes a collocation of ideas, that some latent, incomprehensible instinct tells her is what she seeks? Who shall fathom it? Far be it from me to assume such a prerogative. One word, however. Let me not be understood as speaking disparagingly. It is a glorious faculty, this, being able to think without labor. To a man, there is no exertion so severe as thinking; and he may well envy this charming power of his fair companion that costs her so little in its exercise. 
               Edith did think, as many a perplexed woman has thought. Long indeed, but without any very satisfactory result, however, did she turn the glass, and look intently for some clue, to lead her out of the maze in which she was involved. She sat very long, too, at breakfast; but ate little. She dreaded to meet Walter, and was in mortal trepidation lest he should come into the saloon. But he was amusing himself with some of his friends, and waited her coming into the parlor; where all the guests too waited for the end of that apparent symbol of eternity-a Chamouny-storm. 
               Edith tried to face her trouble, and arose to go in the parlor, but her courage failed her. So she went back to her own dismal room in the damp hotel; and, having ordered a fire and lights, she closed the shutters, and sat down to think, and to write to Eugene. It was no easy task. She sat at her writing-case pondering a long time, before she could decide how to begin, or what to say. 
               Trouble, trouble, how you press the heels of joy! Yesterday Edith was exhilarated to the brink of ecstasy; now she hid herself from the face of her soul's joy, and was in a quandary of wretchedness. All this too for Eugene Thornton-a man of the world! Surely she did not love him; never had loved him; never could love him now! She would tell him so. And, as she had once bridged over a real abyss in the deep recesses of her life's history, certainly she could span this little fissure in the surface. So she wrote to him a rambling letter, that flattered, puzzled, and piqued him; but placed her more in his power than ever. This was her letter. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "CHAMOUNY, August 18th. 
                              "MY DEAR EUGENE,
                            
                           "Let us look into the past a little; and perhaps we shall better understand the present, and more readily divine the future. Some years since, you well remember, you and I sat together on the 'guard' of a steamboat, as it labored up the Mississippi. We watched the spray cast from the wheel; we watched the turbid waters and the yellow banks that border this great river; and, Eugene, we watched each other. A great blight of sorrow had then fallen upon my life; and the mildew of hopeless sadness wrapped me up as with a mantle. There was a tone of soothing gentleness in your words and voice, that took possession of my heart before I was aware. I believe I loved you then; as much as with my bleeding heart I could love any one. If you did not love me, your words and looks widely belied your feelings. 
                           "We watched and talked: talked of the present and of the future which has since come upon us. You said you could easily foresee what the career of a woman like myself would be; that I would go into the world, and demand of it restitution, for the ills wrought me in my earlier years; that, with half-earnest, half-reckless impetuousness, I would follow every whim of my brain to the utmost verge of propriety; that my beauty and my wit would bring me lovers whose admiration would amuse me, but never for a moment fill my heart; and that, though my whole nature required love, yet my outraged youth had so metamorphosed my character, as to have thrown a barrier strong as death, betwixt me and the renewal of vows to any one. 
                           "I laughed as I could then laugh: as a child laughs when looking at its dimpled face in still water; and was almost as eager as a child to grasp the image. Your love took no hold of me. I could have fled from you at that moment without a regret; for I thirsted for the very excitement you foreshadowed, and which time has brought me. I would have left you and your love with no more than a passing sigh. An instinct told me, that like myself you too sought excitement; but unlike myself, you were calm, for, with better disciplined nerves than myself, you could wait for opportunity. 
                           "We talked, you know, until past midnight; indeed, until the yellow chambermaid had twice suggested the propriety of our retiring. How vividly every minute circumstance of that night is impresssed upon my memory! I remember, on her second appearance, your slipping money into her hand, and bidding her let us alone. Then you must remember how the steward came (prompted, no doubt, by the yellow maid), and stood in the cabin doorway near us, and officiously offered to bring us something to eat or drink. At this, in spite of your entreaties, and my own wishes, I left you upon the cinder-stained 'guard' and sought my state-room. There, by the only light permitted, which came faintly through the glass over my door, I exchanged my dress for a dressing-gown; and, seating myself by the side of my berth, buried my head in the pillows and tried to think.
                            
                           "Some of your words had awakened strange thoughts and emotions within me. My husband! He was with the angels. In a measure my destiny was subjected to my own irresponsible guidance, and was in my own hands. I shuddered at the suggestion. I was saddened, too; for it seemed to me then as if a change in that destiny was near at hand: and every earnest mind shrinks from a step which cannot fail to bring it nearer some crisis, be it for good or for evil. 
                           "I rested for some time, when sleep stole softly over me. It could not have been long, before I was awakened with your arm circling my waist, and your passionate kisses on my cheek. I had carelessly left my state-room door unlocked; and you, in your audacity, Tarquin-like, had entered. Your kisses were very sweet, Eugene, and half asleep as I was, I whispered 'dearest!' and rested my foolish head upon your shoulder. Then and there, heedlessly and in response to your passionate declarations, I vowed to love you; and, for the time, I believe I felt what I said. Then you remember, with what a seeming revulsion of feeling, I covered your clamorous mouth with my hand, as I put you from my room. 
                            
                           "In the movement, my watch fell upon the floor, and got a mark from your foot. How often since have I looked at it, and thought of the events of that night! These occurrences must have taught you, that you never could have any permanent hold upon my heart; and that although you might start a spirit within me, it would never obey your bidding. Since that night you know, Eugene, we had been strangers, until, after a long lapse of time, we met in Paris. Since that night, in what a whirlpool of life I have been! What strange scenes I have passed through! I have sounded the depths of other souls; and (shall I tell you?) now my own has been measured. I strove against it, but all in vain. A master spirit has had me in hand, and I can no longer write myself-unloving. Yes, I love, with all the pent force of years-a man, too, about whose destiny there seems to hang a cloud, threatening to darken all the vista of my future life. I am enthralled by his eye, his voice, his touch; and yet I have a foreboding, which presses upon me like a conviction, that for us, in after years, there will be sorrow, greater than any I have yet endured. I fancy you smile at my divination. When you have suffered as I have, you will understand these things better. 
                           "Why I write this to you, I can scarcely tell. Perhaps it is by reason of the frankness and honesty of my nature alone. Indeed, you have no real claim upon me, as your letter, jestingly I must think, intimates not obscurely. Have I vowed to love you always? To how many have you, Eugene, made your vows in exactly the same momentary seriousness? How many are there, to whom you have said, 'Until now, I never knew what love was?' 
                           "As I told you, I have sounded some of the depths of the human soul. I have amused myself; using my power, as you said I would one day use it, not entirely for good. I have grown wiser than when you told me this. I even understand you better than ever I did before. You are still, and ever will be, a kind of early affection; to which I can recur in my hours of lonely and serious thought. When a sorrow has filled my heart, how often have I pressed to my lips this little cross, you hung around my neck as a first gift; and said, 'Beyond the waters, in the land of my old home, throbs one heart, loving and true!' Yes, Eugene, indeed I shall always love you-as I can.
                            
                           "Pray do not talk of a 'nearer and dearer tie.' I can never be to you more than I have been-no, nor so much. This love, which now possesses me, will admit of no rival or fellowship. Neither by word nor look will I defraud the man to whom I am now, by instinctive constancy, bound as with hooks of steel. That honesty of my nature, at which you used to laugh, will never allow me to betray his trust, or, in the smallest particular, wilfully wrong him. 
                           "Thus I leave you, Eugene. I am about to revisit Paris, and it is probable we may soon meet again. Indeed, I shall not be sorry; for I long to talk more freely with you, so that you may better understand me. When I sat down to write this letter, I began my review at a remote point, thinking to clear the way before me, and to set myself in my true position before you. The more I have written, the further I seem to have wandered from precisely what I wished to say; and I look back at this long epistle with very little satisfaction at the result. I throw myself, however, upon the sincerity of my motives and the faith you have professed in me, and wait patiently until we meet. Until then, adieu.

               WHILE Edith had sat so thoughtfully at the deserted breakfast-table, until her abstracted air began to attract attention from even the servants, Walter had found pleasanter occupation. A handsome woman never needed a gallant, when Walter was near. His foreign travel had taken away some of the seeming reserve, that had once made him appear awkward, and now his real assurance gave him self-possession; while his actual knowledge of human nature threw into his manner an easy self-confidence, that with tact he made very winning. Then there was always an air of deference and a graceful condescension, so curiously blended in his manner, that a woman scarcely knew whether she was flattering or was flattered when he addressed her. To this might always be added that impression (Mephistophelean, if you choose so to call it) he gave of great fulness, breadth, and richness of character. It always impressed one, as if he never could find time or opportunity to say all he would say upon any subject; and as if what was unsaid, though more recondite and abstruse than what was said, was still the more to be desired. Thus women, strange to say, delighted to hear him talk; and I will not say never interrupted him, but were always sorry when they did arrest his speech. I do not mean that he harangued, for he rarely spoke much with more than one auditor at a time. Perhaps the most usual description of his address was, that he was "fascinating." 
               Walter was then amusing himself, talking most earnestly to a very beautiful woman in the parlor, while Edith had sat moping at the breakfast-table. Edith, filled with brooding thoughts and unhappy forebodings, had retired at last to her solitary dismal room, and, looking out into that ceaseless pelting rain, from her narrow casement, had let her mind sway away in trackless reverie. She had preferred not to have seen. Walter this morning, and yet she was a little dissatisfied that he had not sought her. And so she had sat for an hour or more, looking out into that shoreless sea of fog and rain-dreary and chaotic as her own feelings, with now and then a glimpse of Walter or Eugene, as they rose and fell upon the heaving tide of her imagination, and were alternately swept out of sight, as the swelling waves closed over them. In this mood she had afterwards written to Eugene. What wonder if her letter was confused, rhapsodical, and inconsequential? 
               I tremble as I attempt literally to describe Bertha Pelham. How beautiful she looked as she sat, in that dull old drawing-room, beside that blazing fire, that dreary August day, listening to the music of Walter's thoughts! He had felt so much in the vein this morning, and had talked so much, he had quite forgotten to whom he was speaking; and saw before him only an earnest handsome woman listening. Talking so fully with Edith had unbarred his tongue; and although he had begun for mere amusement to chat with Miss Pelham, while he was waiting for Edith, he had found her so nearly a match for him, in his cunning of fence, that he had been called on to put forth no small share of his greatest powers; and truth to say, for a time, poor Edith was out of his thoughts. 
               Bertha Pelham was almost thirty and still a maiden. She was rather below the average of woman's height-round and full, in figure and limbs. Her face too had a roundness, that gave her a child-like but not weak expression. Her broad dark eyes, strong brows, and drooping lashes, as well as the sunny hue of her cheek, and the quickness of her movements, betrayed the mixture of French and Italian blood she inherited on her mother's side. Her mouth and chin were comparatively inexpressive; except a delicate impression of womanly tenderness there, that seemed to be overborne elsewhere in her face. Perhaps her maternal instincts slumbered here, and awaited events to give more character to this part of her face. Her nose was short, as was her upper lip, and the nostril thin and a little dilated. You could see a wonderful capacity for expressing scorn and hate here, if it ever were awakened. Her ear, foot, and hand were exceedingly small; and Miss Pelham was almost universally considered a very handsome woman. She had too a very striking and elegant manner. There was a lofty grace about it, which seemed to give height to her figure, and carried all hearts before her. She attracted everybody. 
               Then her conversation was a constant sparkle of merriment and wit. She had been a great reader of modern books; and was quite at home in all the literature, art, and social opinion of the day. Still, with all her advantages, she had never yet believed herself truly loved. She was surrounded with admirers; and she feared, had sent more than one victim prematurely to give a final account of his folly. She had ruined the peace of several worthy families; because she would not listen to the suit of those, in every way eligible-except that she did not love; and as she knew, they did not even remotely comprehend the woman, they sought to link to themselves in misery. She had also put to flight no small number of birds of prey who sought her fortune, which was known to be large and productive. 
               Here she was at thirty, and unmarried. Brilliant and beautiful, and in danger of lifelong singularity. She loved her independence to excess, or she would have given out before this. But the longer she lived the more she dreaded the self-surrender of wedded life. Could there be a better proof she had never loved? Bertha, if ever your turn in Fortune's wheel shall come, that dread will be so utterly forgotten, you will give up all, even before you are sure of reciprocation! There is nothing half-way in your nature. When your love comes; if it come at all, it will be like the overflow of a swollen mountain-torrent, and it will sweep away, pride, prudence, and self, all before it. 
               Walter was quite surprised, upon hearing the clock strike, to find that the morning had sped away so rapidly, and that it was so late. Could Edith have come into the room, and left unobserved? Would she have done so? Could his earnestness of manner, with Miss Pelham, have piqued or offended Edith? He had seen such things very often in some women; but surely Edith was a highbred woman-and no lady ever pouts or sulks. She must be ill. He found some excuse to break off his conversation with Miss Pelham; just as she was describing her cousin Eugene Thornton, of Paris, whom she expected daily to arrive at Chamouny, and hoped to present to him. 
               Walter went to find Edith, while Bertha sat alone, musing on all that Walter had been talking of, and wondering what potent spell he had wrought upon her. She felt uneasy, unnerved, and as if she had scarcely strength to hold herself in her chair. Her brain was confused, and a mysterious sense of the unrealness of the scene and situation crept over her. She shut her eyes, and prayed devoutly to God, to take away the incomprehensible oppression, that was crowding out her consciousness. Walter Ash wood, hero of a hundred battles, what have you done now? 
               Walter sent to Edith's room to make inquiries, and word came back she was quite fatigued, but hoped to meet him at dinner. He returned to the drawing-room, but Miss Pelham had gone; and he was left to amuse himself listening to the adventures of a London cockney, descanting upon American accent and pronunciation: while involuntarily illustrating, by his English brogue, how far he fell behind his transatlantic neighbor, in the correct use of their common mother-tongue. Walter made but a single remark, and that not being understood, he left the room. He had suggested; that in London, upon the stage, in the pulpit, at the bar, nay, in the House of Lords, he observed the American language to be spoken (as upon the American stage, pulpit, bar, and Senate); but in the shops, and among the cabmen of London, and generally in the rural districts, the speech was exclusively and unmistakably English! The Londoner doner stared vacantly for a while, but gave it up. "The gentleman was out of his head." 
               It was truly a doleful day; and the travellers who filled the house had taken to their rooms, and given themselves up to wood-fires, mulled wine, books, and sleep. Rain, rain; ceaseless, pitiless, hopeless rain! Edith sat long watching the streaming rain; and then, as if new energy and courage had come to her, sat down again at her portfolio, with Eugene's and her own letter before her. Her work was quite unsatisfactory. Still she could not write differently. He was "coming to Chamouny." Then she was going back to Paris. This would at least give her time, and from Paris, she could perhaps write further, what she could not say, and what she could not write now. The storm might deter him coming, but under cover of it she would fly. Her party were not very bold-hearted tourists, and were entirely satisfied the sun would never shine again at Chamouny. They were impatient to get back to Geneva-by the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone-anywhere in short, but in this "Valley of the Deluge," as they styled it. 
               The gong sounded for dinner, and Edith found Walter waiting for her. She had recovered herself, all but a little paleness and nervousness, which Walter attributed to her fatigue. The dinner was good; and as the wine flowed they joked, and chatted, and made merry, and talked of that glorious day they rambled among the mountains; and when Edith announced she was about returning to Paris the next day, Walter informed her of his intention to follow in a day or two. He waited only to meet a gentleman whom he had heard of, and desired to know-a Mr. Eugene Thornton, whose cousin Miss Bertha Pelham-" A sharp cry escaped Edith, and her face flushed crimson. She was cracking an obstinate nut; and had pinched her finger, almost to blood-bursting, with the clumsy nutcrackers. 
               Walter spoke of Miss Pelham in glowing terms. He had seen her but two or three times in the house, and was charmed with her manners, her intelligence, and spirit. She was a relative of a friend, of Walter in America. It never occurred to him that his eulogy might be distasteful. His love for Edith had quite disarmed him of his sagacity and tact; and, with her, he now spoke of everything with the frankness of a child. Edith had heard of Bertha, but had never met her. She had arrived at Chamouny, in all the storm, the previous night. Edith looked furtively to the other end of the table where Bertha sat, and saw her eyes fixed earnestly upon Walter. The ladies eyes met. It was quite enough. It was a declaration of war, and no quarter. No one man could be looked at by two such pair of eyes at the same time, and in such spirit as these, without trouble coming of it. Walter meanwhile sat mute, as unconscious and unconcerned as if he had been-the Apple of Discord itself. 
               Edith changed the subject of conversation: they talked of Swiss sights and scenes encountered before they met; the Alpine horn that, though rude beyond contempt, wakened such marvellously sweet wood-robin-like notes from out the echoing hills and rocks; the soft-furred, dun-colored, caressable-looking cows, that had browsed, with tinkling bells, in the long twilight all the way to the top of that dear old Righi Culm; the emerald waters of Lake Zug; the exquisite wildness and sweet surprises of the Brunig Pass; the marvellous splendor, the awful stillness, and the sublime and serene beauty of the Bay of Uri. Of these they talked, and tried to outvie each other in enthusiastic love and admiration. 
               Edith was very happy; but retired early, to be ready for the journey of to-morrow. Walter lounged in the drawing-room, and sat musing by the fire; when a bantering laugh from Miss Pelham roused him to puzzle out some riddle, with which she had already nonplussed all present. Walter was as wide of the mark as the others; but he guessed just a glimmering of another riddle, that was not so difficult. 
               Bertha, from being the life of the company, soon became wholly absorbed in talking with Walter. 
               "I am delighted to know, you read and admire Tennyson: perhaps you can tell me what he means," said Walter, in a mocking tone, picking up a volume that lay upon the table. 
               "I certainly do admire him as the sweetest of living poets. Indeed, in delicacy of fancy and subtlety of thought, I scarcely know his superior in any age-Shakspeare excepted. I have read 'Locksley Hall,' and 'The Two Voices,' many, many times; and always with pleasure and despair. If I could write such poetry, I should wish no other purpose in life." 
               "I have heard those two poems praised, and have myself read them several times, and many passages with doubt and despair: doubt if they have any meaning; and despair of finding it." 
               "Really, sir, you almost shake my faith in your truthfulness or good sense. But, as you men say, 'don't deal in vague generalities;' come to the point. The poems are popular, you will admit. It is for you, then, to attack and impeach their claims to favor. Your reason, Jack, your reason." 
               "Indeed, Miss Pelham, you press me so hard, I cannot well retreat; but I fear I shall be very prosy and tedious. If, however, you will promise to bear with me, I will try to be specific. I know that Tennyson is a poet, and that he has written many charming verses. I know, too, he is much at home when describing women; and seems to understand them, and is deservedly popular among them. His 'Godiva,' for instance, contains some exquisite lines, that show how thoroughly he appreciates the delicacy of womanhood-far more than is permitted by the natures of most men. But what I object to is, the presence of lines and verses, which either have no meaning at all; or that have their meaning so equivocal, they may mean any one of half-a-dozen, almost directly opposite things; or that are so far-fetched, they lose all aptness, and are totally incomprehensible in the context; or that are so vague, from want of thought, or imperfectly digested thought, as to evaporate on their way from the eye to the understanding; or that contain a stale maxim, or a truism, tricked out in some pompous conceit, as big and as empty as a cloud of wind." 
                
               "Now the obscurity of Coleridge," he continued, "coming, as it does, from the profundity of his thoughts, and his impatience of the labor of composition, reflection will fathom and clear up; and the incomprehensibility of Carlyle, resulting so much from recondite allusion and elliptical expression, is intelligible enough, when the reader is upon the same level of culture as the author. But," said Walter, opening the volume that lay beside him, "I wish to know what is to be said of such lines as these, from 'Locksley Hall:' 
                      
                        "Here about the beach I wandered, nourishing a youth sublime 
                        With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time; 
                        When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed; 
                        When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed: 
                        When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see; 
                        Saw the Visions of the world, and all the wonder that would be.' 
                     
                  
                
               "If that be not born of fog and vapor, then it belies its parentage. I would like some (Edipus to tell me which, of the myriad million things 'the long result of Time' might refer to, was the nutriment of this 'youth sublime;' or what revelations of science are its 'fairy tales;' or at what other period of his life these centuries behaved in any other manner than to repose 'behind' him; or how he avoided strabismus, with his attention so fixed upon the past, and clinging with such tenacity to the present, and looking 'into the future, far as human eye could see?' We might expect some extraordinary phenomena to result from such a squint; and, later in the poem, this 'wonder' is revealed. Hear this: 
                      
                        'For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see, 
                        Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be; 
                        Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails, 
                        Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales; 
                        Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew 
                        From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue; 
                        Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm, 
                        With the standards of the peoples plunging through the thunder-storm; 
                        Till the war drum throbbed no longer, and the battle-flags were furled 
                        In the Parliament of Man, the Federation of the World; 
                        There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe, 
                        And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law!' 
                     
                  
                
               "From the realization of which nightmare Vision, of the despotism of sleep in 'universal law,' Good Lord deliver us! say I. Fill me with 'the south-wind rushing warm.' Give me a 'pilot of the purple twilight.' 'Dip me in the future.' Let 'common-sense' no longer 'hold me in awe.' Rather let me have 
                      
                        'Nonsense, precipitate like running lead, 
                        That slipp'd through crags and zigzags of the head,' 
                     
                  
                   that I may grasp this shadow of a shadow, this 'Parliament of man, the Federation of the world!' 
                      
                        'And all for nothing! 
                        For Hecuba! 
                        What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, 
                        That he should weep for her?' 
                     
                  
                
               "Why this flourish? Why, forsooth, that individual liberty may perish, and humanity may die of dry-rot; or, as our poet expresses it, that 
                      
                        '--the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,
                         
                        And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law!' 
                     
                  
                
               "Can there be grosser fustian than that? 
               "It is very fortunate for the prospects of this 'youth sublime,' that his head was not turned by this 'Vision;' and that by some spell, which is wrapped up in the enigmatical expression, 'Not in vain the distance beacons,' he borrowed a better and more comprehensible philosophy from the roulette table, or ten-pin alley, and, rising with the majesty of the comparison, cries out, as one would say-Clear the track!- 
                     'Let the great world spin forever down the ringing grooves of change.'
                  
                
               "Tennyson knows better, now, than to write such stuff as this. He is much older; and I believe his last poems well prove he knows, soberness and simplicity are as meritorious in poetry as in prose. 
               "He can himself characterize the poetic mind well, enough: 
                      
                        'Clear and bright it should be ever, 
                        Flowing like a crystal river.' 
                     
                   And he can be quoted to describe this very rubbish I have been reading. There is in it no idea, no thought, no intelligence; or as he says, 
                      
                        'No certain clearness, but at best 
                        A vague suspicion of the breast.' 
                     
                   And, again, he seems confessing his sins, when he says, 
                      
                        'I cannot make this matter plain, 
                        But I would shoot, howe'er in vain, 
                        A random arrow from the brain.' 
                     
                   It is much easier to shoot a 'random arrow from the brain,' than to have a mark, and to hit it. 
               "I would like to read to Tennyson and his eulogists a few lines from Montaigne's Essay on 'The Education of Children.' Here is the book; and pardon me if I read a few lines from the original. 'I have observed,' says he, 'some to make excuses, that they cannot express themselves; and pretend to have their fancies full of a great many very fine things. Will you know what I think of it? I think they are nothing but shadows of some imperfect images and conceptions, that they know not what to make of within, nor, consequently, how to bring out. They do not yet themselves understand what they would be at; and if you but observe how they haggle and stammer upon the point of parturition, you will soon conclude that their labor is not in delivery, but in conception; and that they are but licking their formless embryo.' 
               "To go a step further," said our Critic, "and to invade Tennyson's stronghold of popularity: it always seems to me that there is ever recurring in Tennyson's diction an incongruous mixture, of the language associated with abstract ideas and the phraseology appropriated to physical subjects. There is often, too, a juxtaposition of metaphorical expression with a verbal literalness of material fact, that confuses me. Worse than all, indeed, there are often such sudden transitions, from the utmost allowable limits of transcendental poetry to the verge of the baldest prose, that I am shocked and startled out of a poetical reverie as soon as I fall into it. 
               "Hear, now, these lines- 
                      
                        'Is it well to wish thee happy? having known me-to decline 
                        On a range of lower feelings, and a narrower heart than mine!' 
                     
                  
                   Or this line- 
                     'I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair.'
                   Are they not of the very essence of bathos? He abounds in such things. 
               "Again, is there any poetry, or sense, or coherence, or fancy, or passion, or imagination, or truth; or anything but the stalest of common-place, dressed up in pompous bombast and incoherency, in these lines- 
                      
                        'So I triumphed, ere my passion sweeping through me left me dry;
                         
                        Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced eye;
                         
                        Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of joint;
                         
                        Science moves, but slowly, slowly, creeping on from point to point: 
                        Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher, 
                        Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying fire.
                         
                        Yet I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs, 
                        And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns. 
                        What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys, 
                        Though the deep heart of existence beat forever like a boy's? 
                        Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the shore, 
                        And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.' 
                     
                  
                
               "Amen! say I: let the 'individual wither,' if he might write that for poetry. It vexes me to the soul-and I feel indignant, as Hotspur did when he met the dandy after the battle, to see a man getting a reputation as a poet, merely because he disguises the commonest sentiments of the day in vague phraseology and incoherent, incongruous metaphor." 
               Walter stopped short in his speech. He had quite lost sight of his auditor; he did not seem to be aware that he might shock her into a positive aversion of himself. He felt, however, he was making a long lecture; and had hurried on, in his random talk, with the utmost rapidity. But he had an attentive listener; and Bertha had seemed anxious he should speak without restraint. Still there must be an end even to the cruel sport of massacring a poet; and he stopped. 
               Bertha began slowly, in a low rich voice, possessing great depth of tenderness, and trembling a little, as if she had felt hurt at the freedom taken with her darling poet. 
               "I should be sorry if Tennyson had no better, defender than myself. I feel that you do him an injustice, as well as yourself, in your criticism. I cannot believe that you are serious in what you say; and must think that you do this, in part, from a love of mischief-to see what I will say; and, in part, to have driven from this room that family of English tourists, that left just before you finished speaking. 
               "There is something tells me that you must love and admire Tennyson. You have spoken freely for yourself; let me do so likewise. I do not believe you have actually read a hundred lines of him, beyond the poems you have alluded to! You have given him credit for something already. Now you surely must believe that he has a poetical imagination, and can speak, even with all the precision of a lawyer who could describe the hours of a first passion thus- 
                      
                        'Love took up the glass of Time, and turned it in his glowing hands; 
                        Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands. 
                        Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might; 
                        Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, passed in music out of sight.' 
                     
                   Is there not an exquisite finish to every thought, and every word, that makes this rank with the poetry of 'The Midsummer Night's Dream?'" 
               Bertha was afraid to go on; she was fearful her looks and tones of voice might betray an emotion, the cause of which she dared, as yet, scarcely conjecture to herself. All the company had left the room; and Bertha, hearing the clock strike, was, in turn, surprised to find it so late. 
               They parted for the night; and Walter sat alone for some time, over the dying embers, lost in reverie. Yes! Bertha Pelham was indeed a lovely woman! He hoped she and Edith might be dear friends. With that thought, he retired, and slept; and dreamed of both, and of mystery, and of trouble: and then all his dream was involved in inextricable confusion; and then he awoke, in the middle of the night, quite flustered; but grew composed; and then slept again, rejoicing that he was safe in his bachelor's bed at Chamouny.

                     WORDSWORTH. 
                   
                
               THE next day it rained as hard as ever. Edith and her friends returned to Geneva, on their way to Paris. Walter bade her an affectionate good-by, and would follow in a day or two and meet her in Paris. He felt a sense of desolation when she had gone, and sat down and wrote to her a long letter, which he dispatched to Geneva by the next coach. Then, feeling happier, he was going to look for what amusement could be found indoors, when a noise in the court-yard attracted him, and a number of guests, newly arrived, were entering the house. He picked out Thornton at first sight; and Bertha meeting them, presented Walter to her cousin. 
               There was mischief lurking in the air, and trouble brewing! Bertha knew not exactly what shape it might take, but she felt a presentiment that there was to be a struggle, and her fiery nature meant to play its part. She did not intend to thwart it, but meant to be in the thickest of the fight. She knew that Eugene loved Edith; she saw that Edith would love Walter, if she did not already, unless means were taken to prevent it; and what, exactly, were her own feelings towards Walter she trembled to define. 
               Bertha, Eugene, and Walter were thrown much together during the next few days. Eugene was fond and proud of his cousin. He liked her independence and eccentric ways of thinking and acting, and she, who cared but little for the friendship of her own sex, was a fast friend of Eugene. He had been born to affluence, while elegant and refined associations had waited on him from his cradle. He was gentle in his disposition, with good natural endowments; his character had never been deepened by sorrow, strained by exertion, toned by discipline, or broadened by self-sacrifice. He was a candid, honest, manly, generous, chivalrous gentleman; because Nature and Fortune had made him so; and he had nothing else to do but to be so. 
               What a contrast to the knotted and gnarled growth of the smooth-surfaced Walter! And yet, both were gentlemen; and, to the careless eye, the manners of Walter as faultless as those of Eugene. If Eugene had more facility and grace; Walter had more dignity, and an insinuating impressiveness that made him a favorite with all he chose to interest. Closer study of the two would show that Eugene was more natural, and never had but one way of saying or doing anything; while Walter's manner, though perfectly easy, showed that he knew twenty ways of saying or doing the same thing, and sometimes hesitated between them. 
               Eugene, Bertha, and Walter became very good friends; and many a sharp encounter of wits was there between Bertha and Walter. He had cause to repent some of the harsh things he said of Tennyson, and when Bertha read "Locksley Hall" aloud, he confessed it had beauties he had never before discovered. They did not ramble much among the mountains, for, the truth must be told, it rained with scarcely any cessation. They attempted the Montanvert one afternoon between the showers, and set foot upon the Mer-de-Glace; when it began to pour most dolefully, and they scampered back to the Hotel at the risk of their necks, so thoroughly drenched that death by drowning, was a pleasant thing to anticipate. Bertha, however, enjoyed the excursion, and determined to remain another day, in order, if possible, to cross the Mer-de-Glace in spite of the weather. 
               Walter left for Paris the next day. Eugene would remain a day with Bertha, and then keep on over the Tte-Noir, and down into Italy. Bertha would stop at Dijon for a fortnight, to visit a relative, and then go to Paris. Dijon was a place hateful to her, for some reason she could not or would not define; and she had half a promise from Walter he would ride over to Dijon while she was there, to break the tedium of her quarantine. Finally, by way of raillery, he offered to come up to Dijon, from Paris, if she would write him a note from that place. He scarcely thought she would do so, and soon forgot all about it. He bade her good-by, hoping soon to see her in Paris, and left her to get ready for his journey. Upon reaching his room he remembered a book he had promised to lend her, but had forgotten to give her. He wrote a short note, and left word with a servant to take it to Miss Pelham's room. In a few minutes the postillion was snapping his whip, and Walter was on his way to Geneva and Paris. 
               As soon as he was comfortably in Paris, Walter sought Edith. He had observed that when Edith's name was mentioned Bertha had been silent, and Eugene looked at Bertha and was silent too. He had been unable to find any opportunity to understand whether this was accidental, or if it had any significance. He was, however, very anxious to learn from Edith something more about Bertha and her cousin Eugene. He found Edith all, radiant, and expecting him. Their greeting was a long and a hearty one. 
               They talked over what they had seen, and of their love again and again. Several times Walter essayed to speak of Eugene, but always Edith adroitly avoided the subject and baffled his curiosity. Could she wish to try and make him jealous? That was a game he could do something in, if he made the effort. He felt a little uneasiness; and was ashamed to confess that the facile, handsome Eugene, whom he now began to dislike, had something to do with that feeling. Was Edith sporting with his feelings? Perish the thought! If ever woman was true, and loved with her whole soul, he was sure Edith loved him. The change she had wrought in him was proof enough of this to his mind. So the matter passed. She doubtless had her reasons. He would not press her to disclose them. When he bade her good-by, that night, his mind was calm, and he was at peace with all the world. 
                
               It was a beautiful starry night; and as Walter walked slowly down the Champs Elyses, and looked at the fleecy clouds that sailed above, the thoughts of times gone by, of America and of Florence, came back to his memory-and he was unhappy again. At night, as he lay down to sleep, he felt a restlessness he could not account for. He turned his thoughts to his darling Edith, and tried to press out of his memory every other idea, but, strange to say, Eugene was always there. And so it was all the livelong night. It seemed to him that he did not sleep, but was constantly getting himself involved in some inextricable difficulty with Eugene. 
               Was it not horrible? Was this the result of his resolution to listen to the voice of conscience? His old philosophy had never brought him such torments as this. Had all his prayers and tears effected only this result? Was this to be the fruit of his love for Edith? What was the meaning of this undefined agitation of his soul? Was he a fool? Was he mad? He would cut the matter short. He would go back to his former self. He would love no woman so much he might not love any other also. Yes, he would centre his affections in Edith no longer. He could surely shake off the chain, and he would do it. So reasoned the brain-sick dreamer! 
                
               Had he so outraged Nature as to have superinduced inconstancy as a chronic disease of his soul? If he had waited until morning, and taken a shower-bath before he took his resolution, all might have been well. But it was not so purposed. He made up his mind when half asleep and half awake. The effort calmed him. He believed he should adhere to his resolution, and it had the soothing effect of action itself. Eugene became harmless, and Edith faded into beauty and brocade, while Walter slept as peaceably and sweetly as if he had been-Beelzebub himself. 
               Walter awoke refreshed, but a little confused. He felt a consciousness that something had happened which very closely concerned himself, although it was not very clear to him what it was. He was rubbing his eyes, and trying to solve the mystery; when a letter was brought him, bearing the post mark "Dijon." There was a flash went through his brain. He remembered all. He tore open the note, ran hastily through it, stopped at one place, pressed it to his lips, and resolved to keep his last night's resolution. Let us read the letter. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "MONDAY, September 3d. 
                              "MY DEAR FRIEND (?),
                            
                           "All day yesterday, I was thinking of Chamouny- of you-of Paris, and of everything pleasant there, and wondering if, in the plenitude of your goodness, you would not write me a nice long letter, just because you could not help it. I don't believe you will, for you can help a thousand things which I cannot, and of which I am sometimes ashamed. But you were bred a lawyer, and I am only an affectionate, impulsive woman. 
                           "When are you coming? I am very desolate in this old town-not one friend in it, except my aunt, whom I can trust and like as I do you. Already I like you for your own sake; if I progress, I shall love, and what will you do then? 
                           "Your book came to me safely, and the dear short note, for which I send you everything that is proper in the way of gratitude. Write me very soon, and do not forget that I am sincere in all I say. 
                           
                              "Truly yours, 
                              "B. PELHAM."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               That was a letter to have broken a Pompey's resolution. Walter was not even a Pompey. Besides, Walter had surrendered his virtue before the assault was made upon it. He fancied he did not feel the same towards Edith. He never meant to permit his feelings to escape his control trol again. Still this was too much for human endurance. He had become very fond of Miss Pelham, and he had counted on her friendship; her love he had not anticipated, but it now occurred to him that it had been very plain from the beginning, and had betrayed itself in a thousand ways. He had been so absorbed with his thoughts of Edith (she was a lovely woman, and he was afraid he was in love with her still, in spite of his resolution!), he had overlooked what he must have been thought very dull not to have seen! 
               Bertha Pelham was not a woman to stick at trifles. Her will was might. And while she strove to keep her passion pure and holy, she was a law unto herself, and her passion was her law. She loved Walter from the first moment, as only such women can love. She threw her whole being into this one passion; and, acting under this one overwhelming impulse, guided by her strong clear intellect, she was utterly reckless of all minor consequences and considerations. 
               Walter knew with whom he had to deal. He could usually summon a tolerably sincere passion at an hour's notice for a pretty woman! However, this was now quite unnecessary. He found he was already terribly in love with Miss Pelham! How much he regretted having engagements which prevented his going to Dijon except on Saturdays, and the next Saturday he must visit his own aunt at Rouen. How unfortunate! 
               Walter was a very full talker, but he seldom wrote long letters. It was a maxim in his school, that the less written is the less to be regretted. Still he was too much of a man, to undertake to mince matters with such a high-strung creature as Bertha Pelham. He tried to write just like truth and reality. He wrote and sent her this note. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "TUESDAY NIGHT, Sept. 3. 
                              "MY DEAR MISS PELHAM,
                            
                           "I cannot find words to tell you how much I am obliged to you, for the good opinion you entertain of me. It shall be the promise and hope of my life to deserve it. Pray, don't tax me with thinking or acting like a lawyer. Though bred to the legal profession, and in some faint degree having made my mark in it, I despise its red-tape formalities-for-the-mere-sake-of-form, and all those characteristics of it, which stick prominently in the popular mind. When you come to know how artificial my life has been, and how far I have been driven from the impulses of my youth, and yet how fondly I cherish all the childishness of my nature-overgrown as it seems with the brambles of care and business-you will find that I too am 'impulsive,' and I hope will not find me as hard or unlovable as you now think me. I am very glad that you like me 'for my own sake,' I only wish you knew me better. I trust you will believe that I fully and earnestly reciprocate all the friendship you can bestow upon me. I hope you will find it in your heart to 'progress' rapidly and surely; but, pray, be very sure I am worthy the estimate put upon me. As to what I shall do, I tell you I will 'love' as strenuously as yourself can. I regret I cannot come to you except on Saturdays, and the next Saturday I must pay a long deferred visit to a much cherished aunt at Rouen. I shall send you a French book on Saturday, of which I spoke to you. I think you will be glad to read it, and hope it will reach you on that day. 
                           
                              "Ever sincerely yours, 
                              "WALTER ASHWOOD."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               Wednesday passed, and Thursday. Walter did not see Edith. Not hearing from Miss Pelham he began to have some misgivings. Was not the letter to him genuine? Latent guilt in his soul hatched that horrid suggestion. He would wait, and not act rashly. The next morning, another letter from Bertha, and now Walter was reassured.

                              "MY DEAR SIR,
                            
                           "I must write a line for the post, but pray do not consider it a reply to your more than kind letter. 
                           "When I found you were not coming this week, I almost determined to put you just as far off as possible, that I might not care enough for your friendship to care what you did; but when I reflected the cause was your aunt, of whom I have heard you speak so fondly, I was content. May you have a pleasant visit. 
                           "On Monday I must go to Paris (I had hoped for your pleasant chat in the cars), to return on Tuesday. If you can send the French book I will read and study it, in place of your more interesting self, in the cars, and so forget I am alone. 
                           "With every kind wish for your happiness,

               Friday, Saturday, and Sunday passed away. Walter had called twice to see Edith, and left his card. She was not at home. Had, he chosen his time; or had she chosen her company? We shall, see by-and-by. We cannot leave Walter just yet. Monday brought another letter from Bertha. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "DIJON, Sunday, Sept. 8. 
                              "MY DEAR SIR,
                            
                           "The few lines I sent you on Thursday failed to bring me the French book, so I have determined to take the cars to-morrow for Paris; not having courage enough for the many thoughts which would crowd upon me, in the Diligence, with neither book nor friend at hand. Were I only a man, I would call at your banker's on Tuesday, and, spite of 'red-tape,' bring you off in the 5 P. M. Diligence. What a glorious ride we would have during this beautiful moonlight! 
                           "You are not the least 'unlovable:' I wish you were, then I would not trouble myself about you; but I do think the lawyer is very strong within you; still I cannot say for that even I like you, less. 
                           "Aunt says I must remain in this desolate Dijon, until after the 20th, but I think I shall not; though by that time Eugene my beloved will be here. 
                           "If I don't see you in Paris, write me about your visit to Rouen. Did you find your aunt improved in health, and has anybody warned you against your too free-spoken friend? 
                           "You wrote me a dear kind letter; and I shall 'progress' just as fast as I please, never once taking you from the pedestal whereon I first placed you. This, of course, I whisper in your ear. And not even the lined paper on which I write (and selected as suggestive of all primness), shall prevent me from saying, 
                           "I am affectionately

               A week elapsed: Walter had written Miss Pelham an affectionate letter in reply to this, but not one word of love or anything beyond friendship. He called once more to see Edith, but she had gone that day to Versailles. Did not Walter know that, when he asked for her? He was not sorry he did not see her. He did not wish any disturbing influences, until he understood Miss Pelham better. On Saturday he went to Dijon, and passed Sunday with Miss Pelham. They walked together, and sat long hours together, and talked just as before at Chamouny. Not a word of allusion to their correspondence. Not one word of love between them. A good deal seemed to be taken for granted; but hardly enough for either to dare to say love impelled or possessed the other. Bertha might have expected it; but Walter was an aged bird, and something more than chaff was required to decoy him. His experience with Edith had taught him not to trust even to his own heart; and now he had no guide, but a subtle judgment, and the cold maxims of selfishness. Returning to Paris on Monday, he received this note the next day. 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              "MONDAY, Sept. 16.
                            
                           "This bright and beautiful morning I awoke perfectly calm, perfectly happy; not a vestige of the unrest of yesterday hung about me. Almost jubilant; I said in my heart, I have found one whose friendship shall make the future atone for the past, my ideal has become real, and I love, as I knew I could love, a true and beautiful nature. 
                           "Yes, I love you, and very dearly; more than I ever loved any one, more than I once thought I should dare to love you. It may be unwomanly, indelicate for me to confess this; but I trust you fully, entirely. You have wound yourself about my heart strongly, strangely, and I no longer walk alone. Whether you will or not, I take you with me; 'those we love are ours,' and you are mine. 
                           "Many thoughts suggest themselves, and I could write until night; but this must be a note only, for I wish it to reach you to-morrow, that my wish may be attended to. If you love me the least bit in the world; send me, with your next, the article you wrote on 'Coleridge,' and all the scraps you can find of prose and poetry; and slip in nicely a likeness of yourself, one which I can wear hidden from every eye-that's a darling. 
                           "It is pleasant to have some one to pray for as I pray for you-as I shall always pray for your happiness. 
                           
                              "Lovingly, 
                              "BERTHA."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               Here was a crisis. Walter had fully expected a crash; true, it had come sooner and more overwhelmingly than he had anticipated, yet he was not wholly unprepared. It was well for the coolness of his judgment, that the vision of Edith had receded so far. Such a letter as this, from such a woman as Bertha Pelham, was not to be tampered with. Such a love was no toy, to carve a posy upon. He must embrace, or crush it. 
                
               His love for Edith pleaded hard with him. It was his only genuine surviving passion or feeling; and it had cost him a severe effort of pride and obstinate selfishness to put her away from him. He had, himself, unobserved, seen her and Eugene riding on horseback, in the Bois de Boulogne the afternoon previously. Had she then denied herself to Walter, and was she flirting with Eugene? He began to fancy he could, and perhaps did already, love Bertha. He wrote her an ardent reply. He told her too of his troubled mind, but attributed it to some other cause than the true one. This very tinge of embarrassment and melancholy, made him the more interesting in the eyes of Bertha. She wrote in reply immediately.

                           "I thank you for your confidence in sending me the sadness of your own soul; it is just as I would wish, just as I hope it may ever be between us. I only fear the outburst of my confidence may have been unpleasant, coming as it did at such a time. But life has been to me often a weary path; sometimes almost more than I could bear. Thus when in your sympathy and gentleness I saw that which my heart craved, I gave you my all, frankly, and it may be too freely. Still I do not regret it. Were you not entirely noble, I should fear my frankness might suggest an affection before unthought of; but you will bear in mind that, when most true to yourself and your convictions, you are most true to me. Whatever the future may bring forth, I shall wear you in my 'heart of hearts.' 
                           
                              "Sincerely,

               Walter sent the "writings" and a long confused melancholy epistle. But recovering himself, he wrote again to reassure her how entirely his love was hers; declaring that he devoted his existence to her happiness-and then he inclosed his miniature among the folds of his note. Before he received any reply to the last, the following letter reached him.

                           "The Review and other papers reached me yesterday. As yet, I have only looked over your remarks on Coleridge. You write, excuse me, with more systematic force even than I supposed, and the least bit in the world like a mathematician; but you do not sufficiently 'take a stand.' Through the entire article there is a shrinking genius; which though it proves you a prophet in your own behalf, is not as it should be; had I looked over your MS. before it went to print, I should have crossed out some things. You, a man of rare genius and talent combined, knock diffidently at the door of public opinion: if I could only steal into your study and reason with you awhile, I would convince you of the great wrong you are doing yourself. 
                           "'One might almost say genius is the instinct, talent the reason of the understanding:' an article replete with such distinctions, should bear no impress of a timid hand-solicit no leniency. I claim the miniature; afterwards I claim nothing. This morning I do not feel like sending a reply to your last. Allow me to ignore it for the present. Aunt tells me to-day, I must wait here until Tuesday of next week: another Sunday in this place is not exactly as I prayed; however, I am content.

               Walter wrote a hasty line saying he regretted Bertha had read the more ambitious article first; and wishing she had begun with another essay upon the "Danger of the Intellect overgrowing the Heart and the Conscience;' and reminding her he had written all, more than two years since. Sunday morning he had a reply to both his later notes.

                           "I feel very much like putting my arms around your neck, and thanking you for your noble trust. May I never prove unworthy. The miniature is very fine indeed, and for a season renders me quite independent of you. 
                           "Why should you prefer I should first have read the article about 'The Heart and the Conscience?' Do I not love you quite enough as it is? Besides, in your writings I wanted exactly that which I selected first. I measured you by that effort, and was more than satisfied. 'The Danger of the Intellect overgrowing the Heart' made me examine my own conduct, and that is not always a pleasant duty, you know. If I pause and begin again in some things, I have to thank you for the suggestion. What a world of good you can do if you will; and forgive me, I almost wonder that for two years, you should have been content to remain a looker-on only, in the Vineyard of our Father. 
                           "Now that I have criticised you, do you like me the less? At first I feared to, not knowing exactly how you would take my frankness; but a remark you made came to mind and gave me courage to send my true impressions. I have a fearful dread of the first misunderstanding between friends; and believe that a link once severed can never be as beautifully reunited; therefore I tread lightly on the sacred and holy ground. 
                           "On Tuesday, I will be with my friends in Paris, at the Hotel de Lisle et d'Albion, No. 353 Rue St. Honor, and you will come to me. However, on Tuesday, I will drop you a line.

               Walter spent much of his leisure moments thinking of Bertha, and how he should meet her. He had been very much engrossed during the past three weeks, in a lawsuit seriously affecting the fortune of an old friend, and had scarcely an hour to command. It had happened fortunately, his mind had been so much preoccupied. He returned on the following Monday evening to his Hotel, weary and perplexed with some unforeseen difficulty culty in the business he had in charge; when this note was placed in his hands.

                           "This evening, or to-morrow as early as ten A. M., I shall be ready to see you. Come when you feel most in humor, 
                           
                              "Ever affectionately yours,

               Of course Walter went to greet her that evening. With dinner and wine and coffee, his perplexities and fatigue had faded and fled from his memory; so that the careless man of pleasure, went to meet his mistress-gay and cheerful, breathing of song and flowers.

                     BYRON. 
                   
                
               LET us go, back and look at Edith. Luckless Edith! What a web was woven, and was weaving around her! Into how much trouble does a little weakness of temperament betray us! Edith's foible was susceptibility. She was ever apt to fancy herself interested; and although cured of the folly a hundred times, again she fell into it. From the time she began to know Walter, all this was changed. Her whole soul had gone out to meet him, and in him she must live, or bear no life. This passion was like Aaron's rod, and swallowed up all the rest. There was no fear she would ever love again. Come weal, come woe, her die was cast; and on it she had staked her whole happiness. Reason about it as she would; try to drive it from her as she might; oppose it by pride, fear, retaliation for imagined injury, still for ever, by day and by night, in season and out of season, it was Walter here, Walter there, and Walter everywhere. 
               There was a prophetic instinct, too, haunting her, that come what might come, his fate was identified with hers. She had felt this from the first. This conviction, fanciful as it seemed, grew with every obstacle; and the further he seemed removed, the more absorbed she became in this one fixed idea, now so fast shaping the, destiny and purpose of her life. 
               Her susceptibility had involved her in a dilemma, for she was still much puzzled to know what to do with Eugene. She had fled precipitately from Chamouny, to gain time for something to occur, which might extricate her. At Geneva she had received a reply to her letter, from Eugene; and by its tone of distraction and dismay, she was as much perplexed as at Chamouny: and when she had arrived at Paris, she was at a loss what to do, as much as at either place. She was afraid to write again. Several times she wrote, and burned her letters. At one time she wrote courageously, telling him that she was resolved never to see him again. 
               This was a little too bold for her; and, frightened at herself, she wondered if Walter had bewitched her. Again, she wrote an equivocal and mysterious epistle; but her truthfulness rebelled, and she abandoned that rle. At length, she gave up in despair. Again, she prayed for help and light; and then, half in fatuity, she determined to wait for chance, to suggest something to aid and guide her. 
               Twice, when she was in this great perplexity, weighed to the earth by shame and vexation, Walter had sent up his name; and she could not summon hardihood to meet him. What would he think of her? What coils were winding about her? How should she find her way out? Oh, for a little more courage! In how many perplexities and falsehoods are we involved, in this social life, for want of courage to think, speak, and act, frankly, truly, and honestly! The first bold step is sometimes painful; but after that, the yoke is easy, and the burden light, and the way a track of increasing brightness. 
               Edith next fell into a desponding mood. All her life had been a struggle. She had been always thwarted in her darling wishes. Now, just as she was within reach of the aspiration of her most earnest thoughts, it was to be snatched from her lips-and perhaps tasted by another! 
               Another! That was the demon thought now beginning to play its mad pranks in her brain. Walter was neglecting her. Surely, he was not the man to stand upon punctilio with her. Because he had twice failed to see her; was he the man to stop at forty refusals, even if he knew them intentional? She believed she knew him well enough to know, that if he thought her changed in any way towards him, he would seek her, and see her-though Beelzebub himself barred the way. There was, she would confess, something mysterious and incomprehensible in all his conduct. Nevertheless, she little knew she was dealing with a man, who could revolutionize his whole character and theory of life in a single night. She little knew how to imagine, that a man might, like a polished diamond, owe the brilliancy of his sparkling to the multiplicity of his faces. She was therefore compelled to seek for more probable causes of his conduct. 
               Perhaps she borrowed light and conjecture from her own embarrassments. Yes! she was sure of it. There was some woman at the bottom of the mystery! Walter was too manly to treat her thus, unless some woman influenced him. Day after day passed on; and Walter not to be seen! She knew he was very much engrossed in business; and tried to find excuses for him. Still, apology would not suffice. He was grossly neglecting her. There was foul play somewhere. Was Walter tired of her? Was there, indeed, some one he liked better? The more she pondered, the more obscure the matter became. But, whenever a ray of light broke across the dark and troubled waters of her vision, there was always a woman's face in the waves. 
               It was just as she was in this mood of mind, when a letter arrived from Eugene. He would be in Paris in a day or two; and he was impatient to see Mrs. Sterling; and wondered he had not heard from her again. He would remain at Geneva for a day or two, and then to Paris. He had been astounded at her first letter; and had looked for a second at Geneva; and was disappointed beyond measure. He hoped to receive one yet, that must have been mislaid. He spoke of having met his cousin at Chamouny; and gave a glowing account of Walter; and was not silent upon the subject of Walter's partiality and attentions towards Bertha. "Cousin Eugene was a darling," Bertha always said; "but he was such a chatter-box. All he saw and heard, passed through him, as if he had been one of the tubs of the Danaid." 
               Now Edith saw through it all. She knew Bertha Pelham was in Paris; and she was at the bottom of the mystery. Was Walter Ashwood that man? Could he give himself up to the wiles of Bertha Pelham, after what he had sworn to herself? Was she to be flouted, and treated with contempt, in this manner? Well! At least, she would be revenged upon him. He would tire of Bertha: she was too fast for his slow paces. She was too fiery, impetuous, impulsive, and impatient, for his cold, philosophical temperament. Her intellectual activity would wear him out. He would come back to her- she was sure of it. But he might beseech her till the crack of doom; and she would never relent-never relent. More than this; she would show herself independent of him. She would encourage Eugene. She would go into the gayest society. She would meet Walter everywhere; and laugh to scorn his indifference and perfidy. 
               In this spirit, she wrote to Eugene: and now that she had a motive and a plan, and her woman's pride and anger were all aroused, her way was clear. She wrote now, quite to the purpose. Without absolutely committing herself against Walter, she made Eugene very happy: while he believed himself again permanently established in her favor, and felt quite willing to let matters take their course. He soon returned to Paris, and conspicuously became her frequent companion. In the company of newly-arrived American friends, they visited together the picture galleries of the Louvre and Versailles, and the public places of amusement; and walked in the Champs Elyses; and they rode often in the Bois de Boulogne together. 
               Several times Walter met them; sometimes he was alone, and sometimes with Bertha. He essayed to speak with Edith. She was barely civil to him-that was all. He wrote her long letters. She sent them back. Her heart-strings were snapping. It seemed to her sometimes, even when Eugene was striving to be most tender, as if she could endure this hypocrisy no longer; and as if she must have Walter back again in her heart, or she would give up the ghost. Yet the pride, of woman-scorned rose within her; silencing, and smothering every other feeling that could find vent in action. She knew that Walter would defy Heaven itself to seek her, if he truly loved her, as she loved him; and so she feared no obstacles being thrown in his way, if he should really relent and wish to ask pardon. 
                
               She did not believe that he was yet free from other influences. Her eyes told her otherwise. Besides, she knew that Bertha Pelham would not hold a divided empire. "Everything, or nothing," was her motto. She would say to her lover: "Hand in hand I go with you, if need be, to Hell's gate; or, though I love you to the core of my heart, and I die in the effort, I put you away from me utterly, and never think of you again. If you take counsel of policy and prudence; if you seek the world's good opinion, and fear its evil report or ill will; if you cannot love like an angel, and hate like a devil; if you are for temporizing, and for middle courses, you are no lover for me." 
               Yes, Edith would show to Walter that she bore her treatment well, and that she was supremely indifferent to his indifference. She would frequent brilliant assemblies, and appear the happiest of women. She found much congenial companionship in Paris, and like most well-bred women of American parentage, was well received in Continental society. Indeed, Edith was always a woman of brilliant appearance, and never wanted a crowd of admirers wherever she went. 
               Eugene served her purpose unwittingly. Walter became very jealous of Eugene; and then, as she perceived ceived this, Edith began to cool and dwindle in her amenities towards Engene. She had crowded all sail for a desperate chance; and reason, conscience, religion, all but pride went overboard, to save the ship. Eugene's heart was not very brittle. It required, as we have seen, a good deal to disturb his equanimity, or to unsettle his self-love. He scarcely perceived any change in Edith's manner towards him, since his return to Paris. Sometimes it occurred to him, that he was not moving onward at a very rapid pace. Still he was her constant escort; and to be recognised as the chosen companion of one of the loveliest women in Paris, for a merry, happy dog like himself, was eclat enough, and satisfied him. 
               Walter and Edith now met often, but almost as strangers. In the most elegant saloons; wherever wealth, beauty, fashion, and talent gathered, Edith was there the gayest of the gay. There was a tinge of sadness in her face sometimes, and a slightly unnatural excitement in her manner, that good-natured people set down as the shadow or trace of the sorrows of her premature widowhood. But as she became more conspicuous and attractive, drawing about her the men of mark in society; and as Wit and Beauty, that had long held supremacy unquestioned, were forced to share their trophies with her; Malice set itself to work, to suggest and find out mischief. 
               Walter followed her wherever she went. If her name was mentioned slightingly, his sword leaped from its scabbard to defend her. It mattered not what she did or said, or what was said of her; his silent worship was still the same. It seemed as if, by suppression and contradiction, his love had at last grown into settled and confirmed infatuation. His hasty passion for Bertha had cooled sooner than he had expected. Although he had a very difficult part to play, and Bertha was not of a nature to be managed; he never thenceforth let Edith pass out of his mind, or for an instant doubted her future life was inextricably bound up with his own. 
               Edith saw and recognised his returning love. Her heart was bursting to fly to him. But why did she avoid him? Why lavish her seeming love upon another? Why give him cause for jealousy? Why make him believe her trivial and fickle? This was indeed a puzzle; but there was the fact. Did she repent her spontaneous bestowal of her love upon him? Did she really love Eugene? Had she any secret she could not disclose; and which Walter would have a right to know? 
                
               As Edith really became again fixed in her determination to keep Eugene outside of her heart, she grew more reckless in her conduct towards, and with him. Their names were often coupled together. She seemed almost to court ill-natured observation. She would go to the very verge of sin itself, to provoke it. All this she did to torment Walter. She could not be mistaken now. She knew she was inflicting upon him-the smart, the sting, the pain of a cunningly devised engine of torture turned against him; but this was the form her love now took to evolve itself, from the intricate meshes of the web that entangled it. 
               Presently, there came an indistinct murmur from the other side of the ocean, that there was something dark in Edith's early life. It was very faint; and could be traced nowhere. Then it ceased wholly. Then came confirmation. There was a story of a false wife, and an unnatural mother; and of a broken-hearted husband. But the story had so many shapes, and was so full of self-contradiction and impossibility, that sensible people dismissed it with a sneer of contempt. By and by, a lisp of it reached the ears of Edith. She knew at what it pointed. But no one else could have guessed the little kernel of truth, that lay concealed in this great; husk of falsehood. The shot was so wide of the mark, that, for all purposes of actual discovery, it was harmless. 
               Still there was cause for irritation, if not alarm. What fiend could have been raking among the ashes of the past, for coals of fire to heap upon her head? She believed that Bertha Pelham had sworn deadly hatred towards her; and that no earthly consideration would be permitted to thwart her will. She was inclined, in her state of excitement, at first, to attribute all the rumor to Bertha's imagination. But might not Bertha know something? Far away in Edith's girlhood, lay a shadow of the stain of an indiscretion, which I shall not unearth now. By a life of virtue and devotion, she had lived down its evil report: and now, should it rise up against her, to cross her in the highest and holiest purpose of her life? 
               She had never given up Walter. She loved him with her utmost power; and every day more and more. She had felt sustained by a conviction, that all would yet be well. She imagined that such natures as his, would be always the purer, for being tried by the fires of affliction. She knew not by what invisible power, she had been impelled into the career of inconsistency and of wild dissipation, into which she had plunged. She could scarcely unravel by what subtle influences she had been led on, step by step, in her renewed intimacy with Eugene; until, in the public mind, her reputation was compromised. She could not recall, by what chain of reasoning, or by what combination of impulses, she had been induced to believe, that the way to win Walter back to her undivided love, was to repulse him-and strive to goad him to madness with jealousy and despair. 
               However, so it was. And she saw no retreat. She was in blood stept in so far, returning were as tedious as go o'er. Walter had insulted her by his attentions to Bertha, and his neglect of her. Although her love forgave him a thousand times a-day, her aroused pride would never let her confess it. Most strangely and incomprehensibly, she had found immeasurable delight in the mere cruelty of her conduct. She had acquired a morbid passion for seeing the very writhings of his agony. Himself, she seemed utterly to have forgotten; except in the fixed expectation, unshaken, but quite concealed, that all would end in the fruition of her heart's hope. In what way, at what time, from what source, this complication of matters out-of-joint, was to be set right, she had no very definite notion. There was a mixture of faith and fatalism in her conviction, that gave it steadfastness; but kept it unobtrusive, inasmuch, as it needed no external aliment. 
               But what was to be done with this finger pointing at the one dark abyss in her career, that she had bridged over so well-and that she concealed almost from herself? Why had it come up now, like blood spilled, crying out for revenge? Was there no atonement for error? Had she not called aloud to, Him who was merciful; and had she not obtained mercy? Had she not striven her whole life, to do her duty, and to obtain forgiveness? Had she not come to be; at peace with herself and all the world? Why, now, was she thus made the prey of tormenting fiends? 
               Edith had fought her way bravely, but was forced to yield at last. To remain longer in Paris, would kill her. She could not breathe the air breathed by Bertha Pelham. She sought the confessional; and in rapid, burning words poured out the sins and sorrows that weighed upon her heart. As the penance for her errors was prescribed by the astonished priest-in his low, impressive tone of command, a sigh of mingled anguish and despair was her undutiful response. 
               Stealthily she crept along the streets; and, closely drawing her veil over her face, sought her home. Once more alone, she prostrated herself before her mirror; and, with a smile of derision, looked into it. No mellowing shadow of repentance was in her wild eyes-not a tear dimmed their lustre; not a sigh moved her bosom. Deep, bitter, absolute hate, was the only emotion apparent. From between her closed teeth came, hoarsely hissing forth, frantic anathema, and blistering self-reproach. She cursed the reflected image before her, as a weak, vacillating idiot-a woman devoid of Wit or energy-a hypocrite, false to herself as to others-a creature, whose sensuous nature had overpowered her mental force-a thing so entirely without ballast, that the very priest trembled, for her. Pah! How she loathed the thing she was! 
               Exhausted with the effort, her eyes closed, and presently hot tears forced themselves through the tightening lids. She wept copiously. Then came relief; and she wept calmly, as a pure and sorrowing woman weeps. Her hands pressed the little cross suspended from her neck; and soon a smile, holy as a Seraph's, stole over that streaming face-bright as a rainbow of promise. "Eugene," she whispered to herself, "we will be happy no more. Our farewell has been said; and I leave you now, surely and at last, for ever. You came to me almost in my girlhood, and made cheerful many hours of my life, that would else have been dreary enough, I fear. You crossed the water; and again held forth your hand to uphold me. In turn, I have sacrificed position, name, everything, for you. The world says you are weary of me. Let its tongue wag. I would not have it otherwise. The triumph you gain for having won and cast me aside, I cordially yield you. In the future, you will sigh for an Edith to listen to your troubles, and to smile at your joys. Casting about, in vain, to find one who shall fill her place; you will, I know, wonder that you let her glide away from you. I, Eugene, shall pray for you often; but you can never come between me and the Heavens I will weary for your sake. At the Convent gate, I leave you for ever! 
               "I go; but first I drain the cup that is mixed for me. I have been mocked often enough with its frozen, wine: this last time, I will fill it to the brim, and quaff to the dregs. If the draught prove not Lethean, woe to the goblet!. 
               "But I lose opportunity," she exclaimed, starting to her feet. "It was by falling into this dreamy state, I lost him. I slumbered, while Bertha Pelham bore away my treasure. Enjoy his smiles, Bertha, while you may! Your power over him wanes, even now. I, whom you have honored with your smile of pity, will yet tear him from you. Walter Ashwood is mine! His eyes looked first on me, after waking from his fearful dream, when the hatefulness of his life of Epicurean sloth and selfishness was sloughed off; and strive as he may, I know he can neither escape nor forget me. He has made me very wretched and very happy. I am, indeed, bewildered at the strangeness of the love I bear him-a love one might fancy allied to hate. If I fly, I know he will follow. Without a word or look of affection, I will lure him to my feet again-only that I may spurn him. And-afterward? Well, and what afterward? Oh, agony and death! Yes! Afterward, the convent-penance. Adieu, Eugene! Adieu, Bertha! Good morrow, Walter Ashwood!" 
               She paced the floor with a stately step. Who and what was Walter Ashwood, that his love should have duped and betrayed her into more sin and misery than, in her whole life before, she had conceived? Was he a man, or was he a devil? She shuddered at that suggestion; and saw by the glare of her eye, and the distortion of her features reflected from the mirror, that she was still under too high and unnatural excitement, to trust herself further to pursue that subject. Then muttering to herself; "Man or devil, he shall be mine," she tasted a composing draught (her frequent solace and companion now), and lying down upon her couch fell into a deep sleep. Her strength was exhausted; but so perfect was her health, and every fibre of her body, that all trace of nervous excitement passed away; and she slept as tranquilly and peacefully, as if she were the incarnation of youth, innocence, and happiness. 
               The next day Edith left Paris: no one could tell whither she had gone. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIII. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "Think upon the time 
                           When the clear depths of thy yet lucid soul 
                           Were ruffled with the troublings of strange joy, 
                           As if some unseen visitant from heaven 
                           Touch'd the calm lake and wreath'd its images 
                           In sparkling waves;-recall the dallying hope 
                           That on the margin of assurance trembled, 
                           As loth to lose in certainty too bless'd 
                           Its happy being;-taste in thoughts again 
                           Of the stolen sweetness of those evening-walks, 
                           When pansied turf was air to winged feet, 
                           And circling forests, by etherial touch 
                           Enchanted, wore the livery of the sky, 
                           As if about to melt in golden light, 
                           Shapes of one heavenly vision; and thy heart, 
                           Enlarged by its new sympathy with one, 
                           Grew bountiful to all!" 
                        
                      
                     TALFOURD. 
                   
                
               AT one end of the quadrangle inclosed by the Palais Royal, in all its glory of plate, glass, mirrors, and gilt, is the Caf Trois Frres. Upon opposite sides of a narrow table, laid with a cloth of spotless and snowy whiteness-glittering in cut-glass and silver-sit Walter and Bertha. The room is quite small, and there are several persons at other tables; but the mirrors on every side so multiply the company and the space, that it seems a large room full of people. Still there is so much quiet-or so much attention to their own affairs, that each party partake of their dinner, and enjoy their own conversation and mirth, as if entirely alone. The repast is the perfection of cooking, and the wines are delicious. Bertha seems in a hilarious mood to-day, but Walter looks a little wan and troubled. Bertha rallies him, and he makes the effort to be composed and cheerful. 
               Walter now played an intricate game. He was involved in a mystery which he could not unravel. He loved a woman who avoided him, and who appeared to throw herself away upon another. Still he felt a conviction Edith loved him. He could not comprehend how a woman could be false to him, after what had passed between them. Perhaps there was some hidden cause he could not discover. The story that he heard sometimes floating through society about her early career, made him tremble; but his self-love would never let him doubt. He prided himself upon his knowledge of human nature; and a false woman he believed he knew, by the very vibration of the atmosphere she breathed. 
               Sometimes the fancy crossed his thought that Edith might have heard the story of Florence, and had invoked this terrible Nemesis to follow him for his cruelty. Again, when sober reason alone came to his aid, he could see how his own duplicity, and his manifested interest in Bertha, was the cause of all. Then he tried, as he often had done before, to banish Edith from his mind as an impracticability. Why, Eugene himself no longer desired to be considered as seriously paying his addresses to her! True, he was still willing to be thought her lover-but marriage was now impossible. Alas, Edith, have you sunk so low? Not wholly. If at that moment she had stood before Walter; though the damning evidence of sin had hung to her like a reeking vapor, and she had said, "Walter Ashwood, you are mine, come with me;" he would have risen, in spite of the dragon-eyes of Bertha, and have flown to her arms-leaving all the world behind him. 
               This state of feeling was an ugly chasm to cover up from the penetrating eyes of Bertha, but Walter had done it for many a month. In truth, his love for Edith, and the career of his whole passion for her, was a thing apart from the rest of his way of life. It was an episode, away from the current of his existence; scarcely recognisable, indeed, as natural or spontaneous except by himself, and then only in his quiet meditations. For a period the real nobility of his nature, invoked by a sincere passion, like a stream of crystal water pressed down by a mountain, had found a vent, and spouted forth into daylight and sunshine; but had soon got choked up again, and ran underground as before. 
               To Bertha he had latterly devoted himself wholly, and had found all his pleasure in her company. Her whole happiness was bound up in him. Her imagination invested him with all the virtues she required in the hero of her heart: and he was true, good, noble, brave, high, and great-in short, exactly as she wished. He was her heart's idol. She was sure he loved her exclusively, and with the whole depth of his copious nature. She was happy-very happy. She knew that his life had been to some extent a very weary one; that he had some sad experiences, and that sad memories would at times creep over him; but she never sought to pry into them, or to disturb him in the moods in which they visited him. She could wait, watching him with the devoted tenderness of a truly loving woman. 
                
               None but a heart of flint could have borne this. Any man having a human heart would have broken down under it. A timid man, indeed, might have been held in awe-from terror of a temper, aroused by the collapse of such a passion, as overwhelmed Bertha. Walter Ashwood, however, knew not the meaning of the word "fear." He could suppress hate. He could wait his time to strike. He could scorn to retaliate. He was deficient in the high moral courage, that discharges duty and leaves consequences with God. He could act as if he felt fear. He lacked faith in the future and the unseen. But there was not in his composition the remotest trace of the species of cowardice, that fears consequences to its possessor. Bertha perceived this: so her own bold and fearless temper reposed upon his, as its natural compeer. He cared nothing for consequences. He would pursue his pleasure. Bertha's love charmed all his idle hours. That was enough. He would not look into the future. The present was quite enough for everything, and everybody-but for Edith! Whenever he looked beyond the hour, it was always Edith that he saw-and only Edith. 
               "What a strange story is this of your old flame, Mrs. Sterling," said Bertha. "She has left Paris, I hear, and no one knows whither she has gone. What a strange being she is. I used to fancy I might like her; but she acts so capriciously, that I have warned my cousin Eugene, not to trust his happiness too much in her power. However, I hardly think that warning is necessary now, so many rumors are afloat concerning her. The last story is that she had lost heavily at play." 
               "She is a much belied woman, I am sure," said Walter emphatically, but with a slight tremor in his voice. 
               "You speak warmly: I always doubted whether you ever really gave her up. Confess now you were once more than half in love with her. You know widows have advantages and privileges; and I never blame any man if he capitulates, and makes an unconditional surrender when they assault. We poor maidens must sigh, soothe, and flatter. We must keep in the back-ground, and not let virgin modesty unmask her beauties to the moon; but widows, like the Zouaves of the French army, may, with impunity, charge in the teeth of the hottest fire. Besides, they have so much skill and tact, and so much knowledge of men's peculiar weaknesses; they can play a thousand strings of the harp, of which we poor maidens know nothing. Then, if they encounter a rebuff, they can either turn it to an advantage or retreat gracefully; while a poor maiden would be overwhelmed with everlasting shame and confusion." 
               "Mrs. Sterling is nothing to me (Oh! Walter!), but I think you do her injustice. Unless she has changed greatly since I knew much of her, she does no discredit to womanhood. She is of a hasty disposition, and thinks no evil can come to her, because she means no ill to any one. It would be very hard, indeed, for me to believe harm, or wrong, or anything unwomanly could come from Mrs. Sterling. Her late career in Paris, I grant, has been an extraordinary one; yet she must have some reason for it, and some explanation of its appearances, I am assured. Perhaps your cousin can expound it." 
               "No, he is more mystified than any of her friends. He calls her eccentric. He once claimed to be an accepted lover. He does not now seem anxious to be thought so. He has told me confidentially, he fancies she has some secret sorrow that preys upon her spirit; and that her mind has become impaired by it, so that she really knows not what she does. For myself I never liked her, and my dislike has increased; until of late I began to pity her." 
                
               Walter would fain have groaned aloud, but he only trembled with suppressed agony. Recovering himself he was content with this protest: 
               "She was my friend, Bertha, and I never will condemn a friend upon hearsay. Nay, I never will doubt, upon one-sided statements. When once I have given my confidence to man or woman (as, I am free to say, I have given it to Edith Sterling), nothing can shake it, except the confession of cause, by the recipient. Edith is a noble woman. She is involved in a mystery which she chooses to maintain, but she will come out bright at last. Here is my philosophy: I always admired this story of Alexander the Great. Having notice by a letter from Parmenio, that Philip, his most beloved physician, was, by Darius' money, bribed to poison him, by a draught to be given him at a particular hour; when Philip came, Alexander gave him the letter to read-and fixing his eyes upon his physician (as he read), drank off the potion he had brought him! That story expresses my sentiments." 
               Bertha had nothing narrow in her soul. Moreover, she was so confident in her love, that jealousy found nothing to feed upon within her breast. Walter had been hurried into a little more warmth than he intended; but it gave a freer vent to his feelings, and calmed him. Bertha replied: 
               "Spoken like a noble gentleman, as you are, Walter! I would not strive to change your sentiments or opinions. But I cannot share your estimate of Mrs. Sterling. In my judgment, her passions and imagination greatly overbalance her understanding; and I am always prepared to hear of her doing very foolish-nay, wicked things. I would be the last to limit womanhood in passion or imagination; but unless one has understanding in proportion, she will soon lose her reputation for common sense-if she does not for everything else worth keeping." 
               Walter could not see any weakness in Edith's character or conduct, to justify these remarks. Bertha-with that calm good sense, which enabled her to keep clear of many troubles that shipwreck common characters-soon found opportunity to talk of something else more congenial. 
               It was a very strange thing to contemplate-this love of Bertha for Walter. It was incomprehensible, that a woman, of her intellectual capacity and powerful nature, should be content with the measured and modified response that came from Walter. It was a wonder she did not detect how much of artifice and deliberation there was in its expression. But who can see the faults of their own offspring? "Every crow," says the Greek proverb, "thinks her own young-ones the blackest." Bertha's Cupid was, indeed, born of woman; but his paternity, being involuntary and unconscious, was a vagabond affair at the best. 
               Walter was beloved, and avowedly so, before he had begun seriously to suspect it. He was not the churl to say; "the pear that falls without shaking, is too ripe a pear for me." He well understood how a woman could-in the frankness of a large and generous nature, trusting another to be as noble as herself-surrender her soul's secret without fear. Bertha had risen the higher in his estimation; because she had the nobility of soul to lift herself above routine, and give practical exhibition of her boundless and unwavering faith in the object of her chosen love. The firmness of her reliance proved to him, that Intellect had selected, though Passion and Imagination had held their torches to light the way. 
               Bertha had done so much, she could as freely do more. It is a common trick of our human-nature, that the more we give, the more pleasure we find in sacrificing to the object of our voluntary bounty. It is much more pleasant to give to a customary beneficiary, even though unworthy, than to a meritorious stranger. There was something of this paradoxical element at work, that dulled the astuteness of Bertha's sagacity. She had rushed so headlong in her love, she had lost the advantage of an arm's-length view of Walter. She could not look at him relatively or abstractedly. As he was in her eyes, and in her imagination, from the first, so he remained. As she said; "Nothing could shake him from the pedestal where she first placed him." 
               These things being so; Walter had, for the most part, little else to do, but to rest upon his laurels, and wear his heart upon his sleeve, for daws to peck at. Still, in some aspects, it was a very difficult part to fill. However, good sense, discretion, and his quiet policy of waiting for the advantages that chance always throws in one's way, had enabled him-in spite of the vacillating delirium of his passion for Edith-to keep steadily his place in the affections of Bertha. 
               He did not trouble himself about the future. This was never a part of his philosophy. Without any speculative or abiding faith in the future, he had found a practical substitute. He had, he said, found the Future possessing resources for its own provision seldom accredited to it. For his part, he counted on them-letting Past and Future, each take care of themselves. He said, as he was fond of repeating, with one of the Brothers in Comus: 
                      
                        "be not over exquisite 
                        To cast the fashion of uncertain evils." 
                     
                  
                
               That night Bertha went to her couch dreaming of Walter. Hope and joy hovered over her. Happy unconsciousness! Selah! 
               That night Walter sat, far in the small hours, gazing upon moon and stars, while snowy clouds were rolling over them; and, with mind much troubled, thought of Edith. Misguided Edith! What had she done now? Had she fled from a slander, instead of facing it? Could she act so blindly as that? What was the secret of her strange conduct? Why had she encouraged Eugene? It was clear, now, there was no love on her side towards Eugene; or she could not have so played with him, as with a puppet. He did not even know whither she had fled. Her bankers said, "London;" but Eugene had not known as much as this. 
               How could she first have become jealous of Bertha? Could Eugene have poisoned her mind? Could she have begun her conduct in a spirit of retaliation and revenge-setting in motion an engine she could neither direct nor stop? This seemed not unlikely; and he wondered he had not thought of it sooner. Yes, it must be so! He would seek her, and fathom the mystery. If he found her unworthy-which he did not even imagine-he would banish all thoughts of her for ever. But if he found her all he believed her to be, he would give up heart, life, and soul to her; and march with her to the world's end! 
               Would he do that? Should he do that? Why not banish her now? She was self-banished-dead! Why recall her from exile; or exhume her? Why not give his life to Bertha-if he was anxious to give up his unhoused, free condition to circumscription and confine, at all? Bertha was her superior in intellect; and was not half so apt to act foolishly. No! Something within him revolted at this comparison. There was injustice to both women in it. They were both glorious creatures in their several spheres. Both had poured out the offerings of their hearts, like water, at his feet. But they could not-or should not, be compared, to the disparagement of either, by him. 
               There was not-and never had been, and never could be-any other woman for Walter like Edith Sterling. She alone, of all women he had ever met, possessed the magnetic netic power to draw forth from him all the secrets, locked up in the most mysterious and labyrinthine recesses of his nature. His most sensitive impulses-fancies half blossomed; little buds of expectation, hope, or promise; tiny leaves of joy; liquid dews of happiness; drooping flowers of pride and ambition; all the unrecognised abundance of that wonderful garden, the human heart, obeyed her voice, and came forth, as at the touch of the wand of an enchantress. 
               He had tried to disguise that love-tried to stifle it-conned worldly maxims-exposed his heart, hope, ambition, and selfishness to the blaze of the love and beauty of Bertha Pelham. Could love find a severer test than that? All would not do. 
               He must follow Edith. He would have some business over to London, and might be gone a couple of months or more. This would doubtless satisfy Bertha. Whether it did or not-go he would. Yes, he would know all. 
               What was there to learn? He never dreamed she knew, he had given her cause to avoid him. With the common blindness of us all, he looked afar off-groping in the dusky distance, and mazy intricacies of conjecture, to find what lay palpably before his eyes. Had he grown blind to his own baseness and duplicity? Almost, but not quite. That was, indeed, an uneasy spot, when his speculations touched it. Nevertheless, it pleased him to delude himself, by fancying that Edith's conduct had not been governed by the discovery of his treachery; but rather by some caprice of her own for which he was not responsible, and which perhaps he could not comprehend. 
               The philosophy and prophecy of Moore's familiar lines haunted him, as he often repeated them: 
                      
                        "Alas, how light a cause may move 
                        Dissension between hearts that love! 
                        Like ships that have gone down at sea, 
                        When Heaven was all tranquillity! 
                        And hearts, so lately mingled, seem, 
                        Like broken clouds, or like the stream, 
                        That smiling left the mountain's brow, 
                        As though its waters ne'er could sever, 
                        Yet, ere it reach the plain below, 
                        Breaks into floods, that part for ever!" 
                     
                  
                
               Eugene was out of the way now. All jealousy of Eugene had been groundless. He would find Edith, if she were upon the earth. He would know her mystery. If he had been the cause, he would confess all, and bring Hope out of Contrition. Should she refuse again to see him, he would contrive to compel her to hear him. Either be or she should be put so fatally and absolutely in the wrong, they never could come aright; or they should be linked together by such adamantine bonds, that no human art could sever them. 
               The next day Walter set out for London. It was some weeks before he found any clue to Edith's movements. It is not worth while to detail his fruitless efforts. Meanwhile let us follow the fugitive Edith. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIV. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "All wily sleights that subtle women know, 
                           Hourly she us'd to catch some lover new. 
                           None ken'd the bent of her unsteadfast bow, 
                           For with the time her thoughts her looks renew: 
                           From some she cast her modest eyes below, 
                           At some her gazing glances roving flew; 
                           And while she thus pursued her wanton sport, 
                           She spurned the slow, and reined the forward short. 
                        
                         
                           "While thus she them torments 'twixt frost and fire, 
                           'Twixt joy and grief, 'twixt hope and restless fear, 
                           The sly enchantress felt her gain the nigher; 
                           These were her flocks that golden fleeces bear: 
                           But if some one durst utter his desire, 
                           And by complaining make his griefs appear, 
                           He labored hard rocks with plaints to move, 
                           She had not learned the gamut then of love."

               EDITH went first to London: some American and English friends leaving there for Interlachen induced her to join their company. It was a season of gaiety, and promised more hope of distraction to her than any other place. It is crowded always in summer with English residents, and tourists from all parts of the world seeking amusement and diversion. The free-life and excitement of the place was well suited to the capricious mood which Edith was now cultivating with assiduity. It really seemed sometimes as if, having taken her resolution to set herself apart from the world, she purposed to squeeze the orange dry before throwing it away. It mattered very little to her who was the puppet of the hour, so long as she was supplied with material, for the consuming thirst for excitement that was devouring her. 
               Here is a large drawing-room of one of these pretty hotels, converted into a dancing-hall for the nonce. There is great glare of light, and a murmuring of many voices in undistinguishable volume, pouring from the open windows at every pause in the music. The piazza and the garden paths are full of gaily dressed men and women; and you overhear broken sentences in every known and some unknown tongues. There is much hilarity and joy to-night. But it is nothing unusual. One night differs but little from another in glory. As one company of merry pleasure-seekers leaves the town, another comes; and so moves on the endless-chain-until the end of the season. 
               Edith is here to-night. You see she is dressed with more than her usual care. Her toilet is always faultless-to-night it is brilliant. The Turkish languor of her beauty is increased by the richness of her attire. As a lady would say; she wore a deep rose-colored silk dress, almost covered with exquisite point-lace. Diamonds and pearls light up her raven hair; while in her hand she carries a fan, so heavy with delicate mosaic-work, that the weight of it seems to strain the jewelled fingers that clasp it. 
               She has danced and walked in that crowded room this hot evening, and with flushed face seeks the open air. As if by appointment, she is met, at the window opening upon the piazza, by a sedate and sallow man, dressed in black, except his white cravat; who, with a characteristic awkwardness, offers her his arm. There is no mistaking this man's vocation. Nor is there any mistaking how unfit he is, for that high vocation. What scandal his abuse of his "livery" brings, upon myriads of self-sacrificing well-doers in the highways and byways of the world, whose class suffers for the hateful hypocrisy of the few! But let him pass. This is a love story, and not a book of morality. The earth hath bubbles as the water hath, and these are of them. 
               With a coquettish smile of regret Edith drops away from her partner in the dance; and, before he has entirely recovered from surprise, she has glided from the piazza into a footpath screened by shrubbery, and is lost to his eye. Quickly she hurries her new escort beyond the lights of the small town; and she scarcely slackens her pace until they near the more open part of the valley. Dexterously pulling from the pocket of her companion (whom I shall call White Cravat), a crushed lace mantle, she envelopes her head and figure as in a cloud. 
               White Cravat is a little amazed, and possibly not free from fear; though in his heart he professes he never would wonder at anything the madcap did. In truth, the adventure was planned the previous evening. Nevertheless, he does wish Mrs. Sterling would bear in mind, prudently, his relations and position. What would his congregation in S-- Street in New York say if they knew the Rev. Brother P--, while abroad nursing his bronchitis, visited a gypsy-camp? His coward nature begins to remonstrate with him; and he mistakes a trick of the nerves, for a twinge of conscience. He ventures a suggestion of caution to Edith-who playfully stops his mouth with her fan-and is hurried along until the smoke of the Bohemian bivouac is visible. 
               "Now," said Edith, "you must lead." 
                
               White Cravat is dogged, but dare not remonstrate openly. Edith has acquired a power over him-whether sensuous, magnetic, or intellectual, or an affair of the heart, it might be difficult to define; but, which enables her, at will, to control him as a ship obeying its rudder. He betrays his disapproval, however, by nervously arranging his cravat (was it tightening?), and taking two steps backward, as if to obtain a better view of the Egyptians. Edith cares not yet to force his inclination. She remembers it is getting late, and time will be saved if she initiate the cabala herself. 
               She passes the outer posts of the camp alone, and is questioned, by a tall, not uncomely youth, of her errand. She would see the most aged fortune-teller of the tribe. The tall youth points to some drooping folds of soiled canvass near at hand; and Edith, drawing aside one of the festoons of the curtain, enters through the screen. Seated upon the ground, with her feet thrust stiffly forward, rests an ill-looking woman-the prophetess. The newly risen moon gives the only light, as its broken beams struggle through the rents in the tattered pavilion of her awful majesty. 
               Edith asks for more light, and turns to the opening of the canvass, by which she entered, to hold it apart, that the old crone may find her candle. In the gap stands, rigidly erect, Edith's almost forgotten escort, who, at her beck, with a suppressed groan, enters the aperture. The light is struck, and the stump of a tallow candle flickers a feeble light from a long crooked wick. 
               "See," said Edith, with a smile that might have charmed the deaf-adder, "your presence, my friend, has brought us glory." 
               A sickly smirk, distorting his sallow countenance, is the only recognition of the compliment. 
               "I'll take your hand," imperiously mutters the gypsy, and the small white hand of Edith rests in the bronzed palm of Cassandra. 
               "Be seated." 
               Edith has been standing until now. She looks at the untidy soil at her feet, and casts a wistful glance towards White Cravat, who hastily takes off his coat and throws it upon the ground. Edith stoops, and in Turkish fashion gathers her limbs upon the clerical divan. That cloth had never before been so much honored. With his handkerchief under one knee, White Cravat kneels, holding by command the dripping candle, while directly in front of them sits the Sybil. 
               Carefully that little hand is scanned: minutely every line in that wonderfully exquisite web is traced with eye and finger of the hag, as she mumbles in disjointed phrase: 
               "Good enough luck-born to fortune and good name! Troubles come thick in early life-pass through them all unhurt. Like gentlemen better than ladies. A black cross on your seventeenth year-troubles you even now-but that belongs across deep water. Foes here-foes everywhere. Among women you are hated. They hate you because gentlemen are attracted by your good looks, and something in your blood they understand. Fair women will do you harm whenever they can. Never trust them. Two lovers claim you now. The thinner one, whose name begins with E, you were bound to-but you are not often serious with him. You care more for brain than heart. He hasn't much of either. He don't satisfy you. You want an eager, earnest lover. You think you have found him in the other. His name is W. He is not always the same. He is earnest, only when a dark stain upon his memory fades out. He likes women for his own pleasure-not for their good qualities. He would be wretched, too, if tied to one woman. He is changeable-very uncertain-and yet he loves you. Let me see why!" 
                
               The tawny-faced seer took, from under a small black box, a pack of finger-stained cards, and, after shuffling them by several very rapid and mysterious motions, placed them assorted in three rows upon her lap. 
               "Yes," she continued, "I guessed as much; he loves you because it is his fate. He can never escape from you. Can he get free from the black doom which threatens him? That is more than I know. He will bring you more sorrow than in your darkest days you dreamed off. So! So! Ha! Ha!" and with a gesture of disgust she tossed the hand of Edith from her, as if it had pollution in its touch. 
               To say that the heart of Edith beat none the more unevenly would be incredible. Her pulses fluttered, and her color went and came like the flashes of the aurora. Her worldly training, however, kept her from betraying annoyance; although she did not cease to wonder what malicious busybody had preceded her. With a light laugh she insisted that White Cravat should, in return for the amusement she had furnished him, stand the hazard of the die. Unconsciously, his dignity had dwindled away; and meekly, with a grim smile, he suffered the hag to wipe his tallow-stained hand, and scan its lines. It was a soft, fat, flabby, chilly, ghost-like hand; and a devilish leer crept out of the corner of her eyes, as she fastened upon it. 
               "Ah!" she muttered, with a suppressed shriek, her face beaming with malicious mischief; "Yours is a study! But it is very plain. No red crosses in your track. Nothing here but slyness. You talk one thing: you do another thing. You cry out against unlawful love as if it was bad as sheep-stealing; and you stealthily kiss into perdition the fairest of your flock. You look solemn at funerals, that make your heart merry; until you scare the young people with your frowns. Poor babies! They call you God-commissioned. They don't know that you carry HIM only for dumb show. They hav'n't found you out. I see how it is. You make a breast-plate of HIS WORD to keep curious eyes from reading the secrets of your heart-where our friend Beelzebub reigns and revels. By the beard of Matthias, if you were only more frank we would claim you for one of us. You have the gifts of lying and stealing, greater than any one I have seen, since our chief Autolycus died." 
               At the commencement of this harangue Edith had nerved herself to brave it out. She knew, from the first words of the vaticination, and an exchange of looks with the speaker, that something startling might be disclosed; but she was more than met in her anticipations by the latitude taken. Well was it for her, that her fan screened her face from her uneasy companion. His little pig-like eyes twinkled, and his face grew scarlet as he winced, with doubtful and uncertain mind, under this translation of the language of his palm. Could he have seen Edith's face he would have abruptly stopped the farce. As it was he displayed some of the heroism that cunning feigns; and seemed to bear the insult heaped upon him, with philosophical composure. However, from this moment a fear fastened upon his crafty and suspicious mind, that he was duped. Rising from his knees, he ended an orison, such as perhaps never before he had participated in, and left the tent with Edith. 
               Out of the reach of ear-shot of the Bohemian camp, Edith insisted upon a halt. She was becoming delirious with suppressed laughter. If she did not give way now, she might not contain her overflow of fun and mischief, as she passed through the town; and so might shock its propriety. 
               White Cravat seemed nothing loth to stop too. Moonlight had brought its romance; and, despite his doubt of the guilelessness of Edith's character, her voluptuous beauty and free manners set wild thoughts whirling through his brain. With the mask so kindly taken from his face by the gypsy, he was saved a world of troublesome explanation. As Edith leaned herself against a tree, swaying to and fro with inextinguishable laughter, he pressed himself very near to her; and taking her hand in his own, began to plead his love, and make his confession. Edith cut short his prosy Anacreontics, by feigning a belief, that the figure just then passing along the road, looked much like one of his vestrymen from America! 
               So they kept on their walk, and sought the crowd again; and she soon was lost-perhaps for ever, to the eyes of her grave suitor. Why should he complain? He had fulfilled his destiny towards her. Edith Sterling, in all her belongings, was far beyond his range of vision. She had stooped from her pedestal, to smile upon him for an hour. Yes. She had let him into her confidence, because she knew he dared not betray her. She had, perhaps, excited hopes in his heart she never meant should reach fruition; but he was still assured the evidences of his weakness could safely be intrusted to her care. In the future, she might, indeed, tell of their adventure as a jest; but she had quite tact enough to dress it up so that none but himself could recognise it. A very little fallacy now could quiet the half-stupified conscience of Edith. This same thirst for excitement, and this reckless gratification of it-that was hurrying her, God knows where-made her every day more and more of an enigma to her friends. Who shall find a clue to the vagaries of a reckless woman? 
               Edith soon quits the ball-room; and goes to her chamber, which is on a corridor, somewhat apart from the chief buildings of the hotel. She neither locks nor bolts her door. She sits very near it, as if to be prepared-should any unexpected guest enter. She has not sat long, when a footstep, stealthy and cat-like, makes her raise her eyes to the door; and for a moment she holds her breath. With no sound, the knob turns-the door opens-and a youth, slight and graceful as a girl, glides into the room. He throws himself at Edith's feet, and passionately clasps her knees, and kisses the folds of her dress. His face is glowing with joy and hope and love. 
               "Ah, Edith! you have made me happy," he whispers, with suppressed emotion. For an instant, her hand rests carelessly on his soft, curling hair: then, stooping forward, and looking tenderly but inquiringly into those dreamy blue eyes, that open so beseechingly to her gaze, she rests her lips upon that fair, unwrinkled brow. 
               "And you love me, Charles?" 
               "Better than life, dearest Edith: better than hope: better than Heaven." 
               "But you forget, I am older than you think, child; old almost as your married sister Maude." 
               "I care not, if you were no younger than my mother. Women such as you are, never do grow old. To me you are only beautiful. I cannot measure my love by my years, Edith. It has given me years of experience already. As I watch you, I grow old rapidly. I am no longer the boy you found me a week ago. I know, as Walter Ashwood says-" 
               "Walter Ashwood! what of him?" 
               "You seem interested. I have half a mind not to tell you. I would like to teaze you a little, by way of retaliation." 
               "But you will tell me all you know of Walter Ashwood; will you not, Charles? Is he your friend?" 
               And then Edith's beautiful arms steal around the neck of the still prostrate youth. 
               "Hold me thus, dearest, always; and, if you ask it, I will betray all trust, ignore all faith-nay, suffer fer myself to be led a willing captive whithersoever you wish." 
               "Yes, my darling; but all I now ask is, to tell me of Walter Ashwood. When and where did you meet? I once knew him; but it is long, very long, since we met-as friends." 
               "As friends? Did you differ?" 
               "Not precisely; and yet, yes-we did disagree. It was a trifle. He put a slight upon me, and never apologized. He asked me to walk with him; and offered to show me a beautiful view. He never came, however; and I afterwards learned he found a companion that pleased him better." 
               "That was uncivil, to say the least; and not at all like Walter Ashwood." 
               "Nevertheless, it was he. Ask him, if you doubt me." 
               "I shall not question him about you. I know he is a dangerous rival; and if he has put you from his heart, you shall not thank me for your return. You are mine-mine only." 
               "Dearest!" 
               "Edith!" 
               "Now tell me of Walter." 
                
               "Why do you call him Walter?-that's familiar: why not Mr. Ashwood?" 
               "Well, Charles, darling, tell me of your friend. I know him well; and fear his influence on one I dearly love-on you; who have, of late, crept into those chambers of my heart I thought for ever closed. Tell me-have you seen much of Mr. Ashwood?" 
               "Yes; we were together in London, where I left him; and, as I was about to say when you interrupted me, he was depressed; and talked much, as if weighed down by ineradicable melancholy. He once said to me, more than half seriously, it was no easy thing for him to keep his revolver from showing him sights in another world. He often has insisted to me, his life would close abruptly. I confess I, too, have sometimes felt the same sensations. Even now, as I kneel at your feet, Edith, a fascination of terror creeps over me, and takes the shape of a presentiment that my life will be a short one." 
               "Pray do not let such weak fancies trouble you. But you must say good night, now. It is very, very late; and I must write to-night to London, where I have friends expecting to hear from me." 
               "Must I quit you so soon? I have just come in." 
                
               "You have been with me an hour; and I promised you but five short minutes." 
               "When may I come again?" 
               "Soon, very soon. I will tell you to-morrow. Good night, Charles." 
               "God keep you, Edith." 
               He goes as quietly as he came. Edith writes to London to put Walter off her track. She is not prepared to meet him yet. She must keep him upon the rack of suspense still longer. Will Charles tell Walter of her whereabouts? Perhaps not, as he fears his rivalry. But Charles is a fool; and who can tell what a fool may do? Walter shall not meet her here! Daylight steals through the crevices of the closed shutters, as Edith, weary and nervous, seeks rest. The sun looks boldly out from the sky, and Edith is still restless, wakeful, and weary. She rises and swallows an opiate-opium, in its purest form. An hour passes-still she does not sleep-Walter haunts her-she dreads his approach-she fancies she sees him pale, anxious, suffering, and seeking her in vain. She cannot, will not see him. 
               Another opiate. Then follow visions of Love, Youth, and Happiness. She plays with her brother, an infant in the arms of a negro nurse, as they walk along a shell-covered covered ocean-beach. The nurse looks, with trouble in her face, over the waters that roll, and toss, and break at their feet. Why is she so anxious? She cannot tell. Is it not enough for her to see the waves look prettily, as they flutter their dishevelled crests in the sparkling sunlight? The baby-brother crows, laughs, and jumps-the nurse is rapt. Edith, like a giddy girl, bounds now here now there-picking up a shell, or a pebble upon the sand, and as hastily dropping it for another. One just beyond the water's edge attracts her, and she play-fully shouts to the nurse to see her dare to reach it. With her eyes fixed on the nurse and child, and her eager steps approaching the coveted treasure, she hastens on. She has just grasped it in her hand, as an enormous wave dashes over her head, and, discontentedly murmuring, rushes far up the shore, and slowly retreats into the multitudinous sea. The sudden and terrified ejaculation of the negro nurse-"My God! Miss Edith! what you made of?"-brings her back to consciousness; and she is angry with nurse, baby, beach, ocean, wave, and all. 
               The scene changes: Edith is with her father, as she remembers him. From the window of his study she looks out upon a broad river, and in the darkness of night its surface sparkles with fiery zoophytes like fireflies in summer midnight. She approaches the stream, and, while putting forth her arms, the waters rise and swallow her up. She struggles, and with the effort opens her eyes. The room is crowded, and Edith's maid is wringing her hands in a Gallic frenzy, and calling upon her beloved to look at her once more. Edith had taken an overdose of opium, and was bespattered with more water than was necessary, or useful-and hence her aquatic views. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia! 
               For some days Edith cannot leave her room; she is feeble and prostrate, and patiently waits for the return of strength. Walter has not come, and she will leave Interlachen before he can overtake her. She will soon be well again. Each morning brings her flowers-roses, and violets-deep blue violets like those of earliest spring. They are her favorite flowers. Charles has heard her say how she loved these early messengers-how they came with her life in a bouquet to her mother-and how, for a while, a fond mother had called her "Violet"-and how she had gradually learned to think them sacred to her, until for a time they were necessary to her happiness. They have a very soothing effect upon her shaken nerves. Charles is quite forgotten in the rare flowers he sends to his mistress! 
               Gradually her stolen health came back; and one day, when nearly all the guests of the Hotel were absent upon an excursion to the Wengern Alp, and Grindelwald, Edith left Interlachen, alone, telling nobody whither she was going. Alas, poor Charles! 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XV. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           "They sin who tell us love can die- 
                           With life all other passions fly, 
                           All others are but vanity. 
                           In Heaven Ambition cannot dwell, 
                           Nor Avarice in the vaults of hell; 
                           Earthly, these passions of the earth, 
                           They perish where they have their birth; 
                           But Love is indestructible: 
                           Its holy flame for ever burneth, 
                           From Heaven it came, to Heaven returneth.

                           It soweth here with toil and care, 
                           But the harvest time of Love is there!" 
                        
                      
                     SOUTHEY. 
                   
                
               SOME twenty miles from the banks of the Rhine, opposite Mayence, lies a city, widely known to fame, by reason of its hot mineral-spring, its gay visitors, its pretty park, and its Kursaal, or gaming-house. Here is a sight for the American and Englishman to see. A fine building, encompassed by a park of tastefully laid-out grounds, stands just in the edge of the town. There is nothing in the external appearance of things to lead one to suppose it to be other than some building, devoted to charity, art, or science. As you approach, the door is thrown open by a fine military-looking figure in livery, red and black predominating in his dress, with a very inexpressive face. You are ushered into a long hall, decorated with singular taste and beauty, but a little overcrowded with ornament. It reminds you of some of the galleries in the Palace at Versailles-with its inlaid, tesselated, wooden floor, its painted ceiling, its marble columns, its statuary, its mirrors, and its lofty look. 
               At the upper end of this large hall, stands a table, covered with green cloth. About it, seated or standing, is a large group of well-dressed, intelligent-looking men and women. It is Sunday! The day is bright and warm, the windows are open, and a light summer-breeze comes over the flower-gardens, and fills the air with a fresh perfume. There are young men and old, and female youth and beauty, indiscriminately mingled; gazing with fascinated attention upon the mysterious movements of cards, counters, and coin upon that table. It is high noon: no Sabbath-bell chimes through the air -scarcely a sound is heard, except the click of the ivory counters, or the jingling of the golden coins that change places upon the table. 
               There sits a handsome grey-headed gentleman, who may be fifty. His face is as placid and gentle as a child's. His dress is faultless; and his delicate white hands show an almost feminine care of person. He wagers often, and with varied results; but, on the whole, is a moderate winner. Opposite, sits a hard-featured man, who deals the cards with a face as immovable as marble-with motions of his arms and hands seemingly automatic. Beside him sits another, who sows and reaps golden coin; now tossing it upon the table, and again drawing it towards him with a little wooden rake. Neither of these smiles or speaks. They are all eyes and brain. They see and calculate. 
               At one end of the table stand two young women, looking like sisters, and yet unlike, except in dress. They are dressed in green riding-habits, with dark green hats and feathers. They stand like statues. Each holds the gathered skirts of her robe, and a whip in one hand, while with the other she throws her gold upon the table, or gathers it up. There is no other movement, except of the right hand and arm. The one is fair, with blue eyes, and hair almost flaxen. The other is taller, almost a brunette, with hazel eyes. Each has the same erect carriage; the same lofty and elegant pose of head and shoulders; the same arched brow, high thin nose, sharply-cut nostril, thin lips, and almost fierce and scornful look. They are as unconscious of the presence of all around them, as they are apparently indifferent to the hazard of the game. They seem to play mechanically. No look of pleasure, anxiety, or dissatisfaction changes those immovable faces. No expression of exultation, or vexation, or impatience escapes them, as the varied changes and chances of the game move on. They both win steadily; and having gained a number of large pieces, they walk into the outer court; and after lingering a moment under the trees, pass down the street, and are gone from sight. 
               Near where they stood, sits a young girl of scarcely sixteen-fair and beautiful to excess. Her countenance is all animation, and her eyes sparkle; nor can she keep quiet; but betrays upon her face every emotion as in a mirror. Her dress is rich and costly. An elderly, plain-looking woman at her side occasionally presses the hat upon her head-as she has tossed it away by the suddenness of her girlish movements-or smoothes back the wealth of chestnut curls that shower upon her shoulders and bosom. Upon her left stands a young man, elegantly dressed, in yellow kid gloves, watching this pretty child. He does not play; but he is quite busy, and never takes his eyes from her. She neither looks up, nor sees him. 
               Here comes a proud beauty, in a purple silk dress-with jaunty, flat, and broad-brimmed hat of nearly the same color and trimming. She is tall and graceful, except that she almost strides in her gait. There is a little flutter as she approaches the table. She is no stranger there. Her aquiline features and haughty eye seem born for control. She gives a rapid glance about the table; and the changes of color, like the flash of an opal, that fly athwart her faintly blushing cheek, show how quick and fiery is the blood that flows in those proud veins. When she bends those eyes full upon one, curiosity slinks away abashed, and she goes unquestioned on her way. 
               Thus passes the time: one goes and another comes. Some win and many lose. No person seems to be aware it is Sunday. No one seems to suppose there is anything remarkable in what is passing, except a few strangers and foreigners, who look on-some in astonishment, some in pity, some philosophically, and some with-an unchecked desire to join in the game. 
                
               There are several rooms almost duplicates of this, except in size. The same beauty of decoration, the same tables, and players, and company. We enter a third inner room-the most remote from the main entrance. Here are the same class of people; the same mingling of age, sex, youth, beauty-hard-featured care and exquisite womanly loveliness-the tired look of exhaustion-the joyous and jubilant elasticity of hope and happiness. The day is wearing on, and it is some two hours past meridian. 
               At one end of the table sits a lady, whose face is partly shaded by a kind of cap inside her hat; who has kept the same place since an early hour of the day. Many have come and gone; and she alone, of the first sitters, remains. She is dressed in complete black, except a single line of red upon the neck of her dress, and somewhere about the ribbons of her hat. Her face looks familiar; but her dress and manner are unlike those around her. She is a foreigner; all seem to think that. Her face is very pale and anxious. She is wholly absorbed, and watches every movement of the cards with the intensity of fascination. Her eye is almost preternaturally bright; and there is a slightly tremulous motion in her hands, that betrays nervous excitement. She has been winning large sums again to-day. She is a young player; and has startled every one-even the Bank-by the reckless boldness of her play, and the immoderation of her success. There is a magic in it, they cannot understand. It is one of those freaks by which Chance vindicates herself from the thraldom of laws and rules. 
               The Bank is closing. The game is over for the day. She has astonished her own fortune to-day. She rises, and moves towards the door. A murmur follows her. Who is she? Whence does she come? Is she the devil? Many answers are whispered, and many looks of incredulity follow. She suddenly turns, and walks rapidly through an open door. Upon the threshold, whither she was going, stands Walter Ashwood! Their eyes have met; and it is Edith Sterling who has turned her back upon him. Getting into her carriage, she drives rapidly away. 
               By much inquiry, Walter had learned that Edith had given herself up exclusively to the excitement of the gaming-table. She had preserved her incognita so perfectly, that it was only by the accidental betrayal of a servant, carrying a letter, that he had been able to conjecture where to look for her. His clue had been so slight, that he had spent some time, and travelled many hundred miles, before he found her. As soon as he heard the story of the mysterious gamester of Wiesbaden, he felt assured it must be Edith. Alas, how changed! All the softness of that sweet face blurred out with tear traces and disdainful looks! All the dear womanly gentleness of her movements stiffened into a stately gait-as of one who walked over burning ploughshares, and disdained to shrink from pain! 
               Edith, then, had determined not to see him. What could be her motive now? Had she aught to lose? Had she not need of some one to sympathize with her, in a trouble that could drift her so far out at sea as she now was? Could she have forgotten what manner of man he was? Was it possible that such love as her's had become extinguished? No! He could not and would not believe it. Edith Sterling had loved him as fervently as he loved her; and whether she had wronged him, or only herself, she could never shake it off. Perhaps there was truth in the dreadful rumors that filled his ear at Paris! That he would not, could not listen to, until he had confronted her and heard her own story. 
               Walter Ashwood was much moved. He had been a mere coquet, trifler, dangler, common-laugher, flaneur and 
                  persifleur for years. In all his dealings with women he well knew he had been utterly heartless and insincere. He had found his exceeding great pleasure in it. He had never been in earnest except with Edith. He had loved her with all the copious wealth of a luxurious nature, that he had smothered and kept almost concealed from himself until that time. Out of this instinct of goodness, that he had so striven to repress, was Retribution coming? His love for Edith had flowed on as if guided by some designing power, until it had so impressed itself upon his soul, that the fires of Eternal Torment could never efface it. Then, as if some demon of his destiny had watched the hour for punishment, he had been given over to the Tormentor. At times he had fancied that the impression might pass away; but every day and every new event satisfied his clear mind, that there was a mysterious justice involved in these events, from which no human art could extricate him. He then had determined to meet his fate, and to prepare for the worst. 
               The first thing to do was, to gain an interview with Edith. This was not easy. He found her address, and wrote her a note. The note came back unopened. Then he threw himself in her way, as she walked veiled outside the town, and, after a scene of violent temper and cruel words that stabbed him to the heart-under rigid conditions, and a promise it should be once only and the last- he got permission to see her the next day at her house. 
               Walter passed a feverish night and a tedious one. But day came at last; and the hour of their meeting came. Walter had dressed himself with care, and assumed the most confident and cheerful look he could master, and went to Edith. She was ready to receive him, and waved him to a seat as he entered. She was quite as pale, but had a gentler look than when Walter had last seen her. Her dress was very simple, and Walter was shocked to see the traces of whitening hair upon her temples. There were lines of intense suffering in her face, that he had not seen before. He gazed at her and sat dumb. His tongue clave to the roof of his parched mouth. He turned upon the couch on which he sat, and looked away from her, hoping to reassure himself. He felt as if a tightening hand grasped his throat. It seemed as if this woman always reversed the order of his nature. He that was so prompt of speech-and fled from woman's love-was dumb-and was the pursuer now! 
                
               Edith saw him turning uneasily upon the couch, and, by a woman's instinct, divined all. Then the kindliness of her lovely nature arose within her. Pride and resentment gave way. 
               "Walter Ashwood, this is our last meeting, let us not waste it in ceremony. You have sought me, found me; now speak to me. It were far better otherwise; but you have chosen, no doubt deliberately, and I will frankly tell you all you desire to know." 
               "Walter approached her, took her hand, was smothering it with kisses, and falling at her feet, when she stopped him and said: "No, no, this must not be." He led her to the couch where he had been, and they sat down side by side; and Edith allowed Walter to retain her hand in his, but no more. 
               "Oh, Edith, how have I wronged you! How have I made myself the instrument of your torment and my own! How fully have I deserved this retribution! I can offer no palliation for my conduct. My actions have been base and treacherous to you, who was entitled to the excess of good faith from me. I am like the base Judean who threw a pearl away richer than all his tribe. Oh, Edith, that I could atone for the past! Tell me it is not too late. Let me lay my life at your feet; take the poor offering and command it at your will. I will be your slave. I, that have defied Heaven in my pride and selfishness, will crawl upon the earth to do your bidding. Or, if you will raise me to your equal, I will fold you in my arms and march through the world triumphant, though adder-tongued Slander hiss louder than the roar of the ocean." 
               Walter trembled violently as he spoke, and stopped from excess of emotion. Tears were struggling in his eyes and throat, and he choked them back until he could speak no more. 
               Edith's head fell upon his shoulder, and a cry went up from her lips, so full of infinite and immitigable misery, that it might well have been the despairing wail of the damned. Then the flood-gates of her eyes were opened; and tears fell like rain from fountains that she had tried to believe dried up forever. With all this, however, her judgment was calm. Her resolution had been taken before this; or it is hard to say into what new folly she might not have been betrayed. She had imagined what might come of this interview; had tried to avoid it; and when it must come, she had determined it should not shake her purpose. She had been hurried by some gust of her blind passions into conduct she could never excuse; and was steeped in error so far, retreat was now impossible. It was death-in-life she was suffering now. She could not feel greater agony and live. 
               She sobbed upon his shoulder as if her heart was breaking. It was broken already. 
               "Oh, Walter! Say no more. What you vainly imagine can never be. Much of the evil report you have heard of me is true. I knew not what I was doing, or wherefore I did it. When you first met me I was calm and content. Your love lifted me up to a Heaven of happiness, beyond my most sanguine dreams. When I found myself involved in a vortex, from which I could not extricate myself, and believed that I was losing your love, an inextinguishable fire burned in my blood and brain. I seem to myself to have been driven about by some blind avenging Fury, and to have given hate and horror to all whom I should have cherished. I hardly know what I may have done. I have a dim reminiscence of scenes of great excitement; of proffers of love and devotion; of deeds from which my womanhood turns away shuddering with disgust. 
               "It is all over now. My life has ended. I have outlived my time. I wait and pray my sins be forgiven. Do not let the shadow of Hope mislead you. Do not strive to shake my purpose. It is unalterably fixed. You will never see me again. You have genius, and, with an ambition which a worthier love will inspire in you, will rise to distinction. You may, and will, yet win some of the great prizes of life. Take, as the legacy of one who has loved you not wisely but too well, her hope and wish that, even in the deep seclusion of her retirement from the world, she may sometimes hear, that you have put those noble faculties which you possess, to the achievement of renown for goodness and greatness." 
               Walter gazed long and earnestly into that sweet face, blurred and hardened as it was, and sought one spark of hope; but it was not there. He felt it would be in vain to plead. He had no thought for himself now. He had not heeded Edith's behest. He had searched some way to extricate Edith, but it was in vain, and he gave it up. There was nothing to be said. So they clasped each other's hands, and watched the tears streaming down each other's cheeks, in dumb apathy. Edith was the first to recover self-possession. She arose and said, "Walter, we must part. Farewell! I forgive everything. Remember me sometimes, and may we meet in Heaven." He stooped and kissed her mouth, as if his whole life had gone forth in that embrace-and left her. 
                
               A few days after it was publicly known that an American lady of great wealth (not a little of which, rumor said, had been won in play at Wiesbaden), had given her fortune to a convent at Ravenna, and had become herself an inmate. The curious stranger may learn the story there, for the facts are recent; and it is not impossible, by a little adroitness, he may see, moving about the homely apartments of those forbidding walls, the draped and hooded figure of Edith Sterling. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XVI. 
                
                   
                     
                         
                           'And art thou tired of being? Has the grave 
                           No terrors for thee? Hast thou sunder'd quite 
                           Those thousand meshes which old custom, weaves 
                           To bind us earthward, and gay fancy films

                           Those nice regards, dear habits, pensive memories, 
                           That change the valor of the thoughtful breast 
                           To brave dissimulation of its fears? 
                           Is Hope quenched in thy bosom?" 
                        
                      
                     TALFOURD. 
                   
                
               WALTER ASHWOOD became a sad and silent man. He rarely spoke, and he avoided observation. He was seen walking alone among the winding paths of the pretty park at Wiesbaden, absorbed in self-communion, for several days after his parting from Edith. He was deeply agitated, if one might guess from his appearance. Sometimes he would sit for hours gazing upon the sluggish water, and again he would be seen moving rapidly along the walks, as if in pursuit of some lost object. 
               "What is left now?" said he to himself. "Florence is gone, and I the murderer. Edith is imprisoned, and I the gaoler. Alas, for Bertha! But no, I need not pity her, she is stronger than I am, and can bear up better than myself. What is life worth to me? Wherefore should I cling to it? Better a thousand times I had never been born, than to have lived to such a decay of hope as this! How have I sown the wind, and reaped the whirlwind? How a just retribution has found me out, and untwisted all the mazes of that complex web of selfishness, into which I had wrapped myself, and believed myself invulnerably safe. The oil of life is gone, I do but linger in the wick, without light or heat-nothing is left but offensive smoke." 
               Was that sturdy brain yielding, or how could such weak and childish repining sway the strong man? At times it seemed, as if the childishness of his nature swallowed up all his ripened judgment, and obscured his acute faculties. He groped about for something to stay him, as he felt the maxims of his philosophy slipping away from under him. He had set out in life looking after his own pleasure. That bounded his theory of existence. Here he was now, scarce at middle life, and the play was ended, and he waited for the curtain to drop. 
               He had most of these feelings before to-day; but the dissipation of travel, for a year or two, in Europe, had obliterated the impression of them; and had seemed to awaken a new sense and purpose of existence. Meeting Edith where he did, he began to be confirmed in the new impression that life had happiness in store for him. We have seen how he dashed this cup from his lips, in the very perversity of his nature; just at the moment when, by so doing, he could make himself most miserable. Now the old feeling of satiety and disgust came back to him, when freshly smarting with remorse; and his sufferings threw him into profound, and, at times almost apathetic, melancholy. 
               One by one the victims of his duplicity and treachery rose before his memory, and he could not shut them from his eyes. Some, nay most of them, it is true, had found consolation in the affection of loving hearts, and had no reproaches to make; but his self-reproval was scarce the less severe. Then, high above all in his half frantic visions-pillowed upon snowy clouds, and born along by invisible hands-rose the dripping figure of Florence, with a placid smile upon her dead lips, that chilled him to the marrow of his bones. He muttered: 
                      
                        "Me miserable, which way shall I fly, 
                        Infinite wrath and infinite despair?-- 
                        Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell." 
                     
                  
                   and groaned aloud as this scene printed itself upon his brain. 
               All day long the same thoughts wearied him, and all night the same dread visions shook him. He could find no rest for his soul. He turned to the maxims of his philosophy, and they drove him back upon himself for a fool. 
               His religion he next sought. That also was too narrow. He believed in God, and the immortality of the soul; and the authenticity of Revelation his reason forbade him to doubt: but the Christian's theory of Salvation, and the Christian's Hope he never could comprehend-could not accept, and it did not help him. He had obliterated his capability of faith by self-indulgence. He prayed to God mechanically, but it brought him no relief. He could not rightly comprehend Prayer. His notion of the Creator excluded a full realization of the idea of prayer. He could not put himself in communion with the Giver-of-all-Good. He had constructed a tower of Babel-like strength, to keep himself beyond the need of the Christian's God and Saviour; and now, when he had most need of reliance upon it, there was nothing for him but confusion-and no help, or hope, or light, to guide him through the Dark-Valley. 
                
               Oh, what untold sorrow do our early teachers provide for us, who neglect to fix, at the first possible moment, in our infant minds, clear ideas of Christian Hope! When Death shall come what can sustain us, if we waver? And how can we do otherwise than waver, if the instinctive craving of our infant souls was not supplied with this aliment, before they could wander abroad and lose their capacity for undoubting faith! Happy is the man whose mother's fervent piety was his earliest impression concerning the Infinite! 
               Walter Ashwood was not a Christian. His was the religion of the heathen philosophers, with only more fixed ideas of right and wrong-of future rewards and punishments. He had not their unbelief to make him indifferent; and he had little more belief than they to sustain him. He had conscience and religion enough to know and feel that he had wronged his fellow-outraged a noble nature within himself-and disobeyed the laws of the Creator. He knew that for this he must suffer. He felt that he was now suffering the just desert of evil-doing. But what was to be the end of it? What could he do now? Whither was he drifting? 
               He had contrived for himself a cautious theory, when he set out in life. He had carefully hedged it about with cold rules of policy, so as to ward off all insidious approaches to his feelings, or affections. He had locked up his heart in thick-ribbed ice. He had put on the iron-mail of selfishness-and had gone forth into the world, resolved to cut his way through difficulty; self-reliant, and defiant, nay, almost blasphemously so. He had youth and elasticity then. He had no sin then. He had much to see, and to learn, and to do then. His philosophy stood by him well, for a time. It had the elements of temporary success and prosperity in it. But it had no capacity or power of duration or expansion. It was not bottomed upon faith of any kind, except faith in himself. That is, indeed, the highest kind of faith; if it send its roots down into that faith in the Unseen, which should be the supporting under-strata of all hope and trust in life. If it come short of that, the first shock of storm and tempest topples it down headlong. 
               Such was Walter's state and condition now. He had reaped prosperity and pleasure-and he had avoided, trouble, sorrow, and pain for a long season, by the strength and cunning of his philosophy. But when his human nature had burst the bounds of a narrow selfishness; when, in his love for Edith, his manhood had leaped the barriers he had set, and had vindicated itself; his petty system of life was all thrown into disorder. The natural and the artificial would not harmonize, or coalesce. He could not manage, or conduct such a passion as that, by any rule or maxim to be found in his ethics. No wonder that in the attempt he had destroyed everything. 
               By flashes, and at times by connected thought, these views passed before his mind. He determined, however, to do nothing rashly. He would give himself ample time for due reflection. He felt a growing conviction whither he was tending, and what it would all come to, at last; but he would hasten nothing. It was a part of his punishment; and as he had enjoyed the pleasure, so with Stoical firmness he would bear the pain, which was the natural fruit of his own voluntary conduct. He did not shrink from that. He bared his breast to the storm, and bade it "howl on." 
               In a cognate mood, with solemn emphasis, he repeated the words of a favorite author-America's gravest and most philosophical poet: 
                      
                        "Well, I have had my turn, have been 
                        Raised from the darkness of the clod, 
                        And for a glorious moment seen 
                        The brightness of the skirts of God; 
                         
                        And knew the light within my breast, 
                        Though wavering oftentimes and dim, 
                        The power, the will, that never rest, 
                        And cannot die, were all from Him." 
                     
                  
                
               What could he do? Had he any further business upon the earth? Was he not an ugly incumbrance? Who could profit by his existence? Could he repair any mischief he had done? His mind reverted to Bertha, and his ears tingled with shame, when he thought how infinitely beyond his reach, the scorn of that splendid creature placed her. Who loved him now? Whom did he care for, or who cared for him? Ties of home and kindred he had scarcely ever recognised, except to repulse with disdain. Friends even had shrunk from him, as they fully comprehended the narrowness of his sympathies. He stood upon the shoal of time quite alone. 
               Why not go forth into the world, and, keeping his sorrow for his secret moments, again seek joy, and pleasure, and happiness? He was yet young-had great knowledge of human nature, and could be as attractive, and fascinating, and insinuating as ever-why not put these powers into exercise? No: he could not. He had lost the desire for pleasure. He had but one feeling or sentiment now-overwhelming remorseful sadness, and satiety;-sadness that wrapped him up as with a pall, and would not be shaken off. 
               Why not (said once a higher impulse), seek a sounder philosophy-a wider theory of life? Why not summon all his energy, bury his sin and sorrow, let the past be no longer looked into mournfully; and, in the vigorous exertion of his intellectual powers, and acquirements, taking his rank in the world, atone for one life of error by another of virtuous action? This was but the prompting of his imagination. It had cheated him too often to find any response now. He had no answer to this. Having no real or abiding faith in God's providence as it governs the world, the suggestion died away, almost as soon as it came into being. Walter Ashwood was dead now, to all such nobility of purpose as this. 
               What, then, was to be done? Life could not long be borne thus. It pressed about him like the heavy, galling fetters of a criminal. His faculties, from their long strain and tension to one point, were beginning to be less subject to his volition: nay, he fancied even his powers of attention began to fail. The first symptom of this kind alarmed him; and he almost came to a sudden determination to delay his half-formed purpose no longer, but at once to deal with it sharply. A more careful examination nation, however, satisfied him his fears had exaggerated some circumstance in itself unimportant. But the effect was not lost. He knew what was coming. The high excitement of the past few weeks had written its story upon his brain. There were seeds planted there, that he knew would germinate rapidly, if not checked in season. 
               What was to be done? If Life had nothing in it, what had Death? He was not startled or disturbed, as his thoughts veered around in that direction. He could look Death as calmly in the face, as if it were a friend. Death! At least there was change. That was something. Could he be worse? Was he capable of greater suffering than to endure a joyless, hopeless, purposeless existence-smarting under the keen anguish of remorse? 
               Physical suffering, too, would cease. From Death, once embraced, he could not escape; and the very necessity of endurance would bring the strength to endure. From Life he could escape; and that thought made it more agonizing to bear those ills from which he had it in his power to fly. 
               Sorrowfully he remembered the disappointed Raleigh's bitter words: "Oh, eloquent and mighty Death! Whom none could advise, thou hast persuaded; what none hath dared, thou hast done; and whom all the world hath flattered, thou only hast cast out of the world, and despised! Thou hast gathered together all the far-stretched greatness-all the pride, cruelty, and ambition of men, and covered it over with these two narrow words-'hic jacet.'" 
               Whither would he go? Surely he would go where myriads had gone before. Florence would be there. Would he see her? Perhaps so. There was comfort in that conjecture. All would be forgiven by her; and he could at least let her know his contrition. The Spirits of the mighty dead would be there. Heroes and Demigods among men, would be there. The beings now upon the earth were utterly insignificant in the contrast. Then his maudlin fancy pictured to his over-tasked mind the realms where the Spirits of the departed dwell. In half-dream and half-wakefulness, he would sit late in the night, for hours, out-watching the moon and stars; and passing in review, before his distempered fancy, the great and good that Time has given to Heaven. The continual stretch of his mind, by this one string, was beginning to tell upon its powers. He wore the same look of settled melancholy; but it was now obvious to some observers, that his attention to passing objects, never active, was growing daily more and more obtuse. 
                
               There had been a mild day in November. The sun set in a blaze of glory, making the heavens all a-glow; and the evening was warmer even than the day had been. Walter was at his room, in his hotel at Mayence, whither he had gone a few days after his interview with Edith at Wiesbaden. He had occasionally crossed over; but had never remained long. It was bright moonlight-not a cloud in the sky-and it was far in the night, while Walter sat by the open window, gazing at the naked moon. There was nothing peculiar in this; for he had often passed the night there-sad, silent, and thoughtful as now. 
               As the moon shone upon his face, it was plain to see a change in it, from even the look of the previous day. It was less downcast. There was a rigid look of the cheeks, and a pressure of the lips, and a wide unveiling of the fixed eyes, that betrayed a settled purpose. There was a hard, wild stare in that countenance, which had looked so blank for many days. He seemed to be turning his eyes towards the moon, as if intently gazing at her; but he scarcely saw anything, except with his mind's eye. 
               There he sat-motionless, pitiless-dumb; and bent his head upon the window-sill, until the chill night-dews might have been wrung from his hair. He looked far out into the firmament; and there arose a vision, that filled the sky; and his every sense and pulse was still, as he gave up his entire being to it. Away down in the caverns of the Empyrean, as they opened, he saw groups of men and women-walking in meadows, or talking together by gestures, and perhaps by voices he could not hear. Then the angels began ascending and descending, from a far dizzy height, below the plane of the earth's horizon. There were no rocks, or hills, or trees, or paths, or clouds. They seemed to ascend and descend by a law of their being, and without effort. Then it appeared as if they were carrying the departed to the new realms such were to inhabit. Now ascended the draped figure, of a man full of years, around whose face shone a halo of light. Then again, 
                      
                        "One comes shining like a saint, 
                        But her face I cannot paint, 
                        For mine eyes and blood grow faint." 
                     
                   Next was borne along, upon the viewless wind, a fair youth, with the down of adolescence just dawning upon his lip. Then came groups of young children, who seemed almost to float, upward, without being lifted. After these came a bride, whose veil was her winding-sheet sheet. Then arose, gently as a cloud of mist, a young mother, with her new-born babe upon her breast. On and on-endlessly on-the procession kept moving. Far upwards, to the giddy summit of the ascending stream, Walter gazed until he saw sapphire walls, bathed in purple light-and many myriads of sweet faces, looking over them wistfully down below. He looked long and earnestly, until at length one gentle face seemed to recognise him. It looked at him with such pitying eyes, and so beseechingly, he could not endure the sight. He could not be mistaken. It was Florence! He could see no more-the vision faded away; and the moon shone on as cold and calm as ever. 
               It was getting very late. No sound was to be heard, save the rippling current of the flowing Rhine. Walter arose, and closed the window. Then, pouring into a goblet a little water-he drank it off; and lay down calmly, quietly, upon his bed, to sleep-as if he had done nothing unusual, and was at peace with himself. 
               From that sleep, he never awoke. In the morning, he was dead. 
                      
                        "And forever, and forever, 
                        As long as the river flows, 
                        As long as the heart has passions, 
                        As long as life has woes; 
                         
                        The moon, and its broken reflection, 
                        And its shadows, shall appear 
                        As the symbol of love in Heaven, 
                        And its wavering image here."

                           "Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses, 
                           A box where sweets compacted lie, 
                           My Music shows ye have your closes, 
                           And all must die. 
                        
                         
                           "Only a sweet and virtuous soul, 
                           Like season'd timber, never gives; 
                           But though the whole would turn to coal, 
                           Then chiefly lives." 
                        
                      
                     HERBERT. 
                   
                
               "WHAT of Bertha Pelham?" As a faithful historian, I should tell her story too; yet I hesitate. I distrust my power to do her justice. Ordinary women I think I understand, and fancy sometimes I can portray their characters, motives, and actions, where the facts are fully authenticated to me. But when a clear-minded, high-souled, God-loving woman has to deal with an affection, or a passion that has thrown its strong arms about her, and clasped her in its beloved embrace, until it has cradled the sagacity of her nature into deep sleep; and then, by a sudden treachery, has let her fall to the earth; who shall depict the contending feelings of shame, mortification, scorn, contempt, hate, and pity, that swell her breast? 
               Bertha was not a woman to trifle, or to be trifled with. She had a bright, clear, far-seeing intellect; and she could unravel the characters, and conduct of most men, with a facility that spread dismay whenever she put forth her powers; but so meekly did she bear her faculties that she made but few enemies by their display. She rather used them defensively than aggressively; and her Minerva hedged about her as if she had been, indeed, a queen of peace, and good will. But with Walter, even her defences had failed utterly. He had carried the outposts, scaled the ramparts, and taken possession of the citadel; without firing a gun, striking a blow, or losing a man. All her sentinels had slept; and when the morning sun shone into the eyes of the sluggards, and aroused them, so complete had been the capture, and reduction to possession of the spoils of conquest, that every subject fell into the discipline of the new regime, with as little compunction, or curiosity, as if there had been a mere change of barracks, instead of a change of masters. She had been the victim of a surprise. No one could tell how the thing was done, but so it was; she had completely surrendered at discretion, with no guaranty of the honor, no pledge of the intentions, and no hostage of the conduct of her captor. Conceive her dismay when this magnanimity was basely trifled with; and the noble, disinterested generousness of her actions matched by craft and cunning. Duplicity for her frankness-lies for her truth! 
               She had borne everything in the way of ungenerous observation-from those who had been led to suppose her one, who had scornfully defied the power of love beyond her sex, but had compulsively succumbed at last. With a darling image of that unknown God, whom she so ignorantly worshipped, in her heart, she had cared little for the taunts of the malicious and mischievous. To herself she had often said, if they only knew him as she knew him, how little they would wonder that even she could love him! Now, alas! the scaffolding upon which she had stood while she built her castles, tumbled with a crash, and she had fallen prostrate. What could lift her up again, or sustain her now? She must fall back upon the old elements of character, that stood by her in hours of peril, before this fugitive crossed her path. But it would be false to history to say that mortified pride settled down quietly in its cell, without a struggle, or a paroxysm. It would, too, be a denial of her humanity to refuse to admit, that shame for a little time wrapping her up as in a mist, blinded her sight, and embarrassed her steps. 
               She had loved with her whole soul, and when, Ixion-like, she embraced a shadow, the perfidy of the hollow cheat sent the hot blood of rage, tingling into her cheeks and ears. The revulsion was terrible. As when a tide falls low, and runs far out at sea, it leaves vast flats uncovered, and the returning tide swells and foams on with eager power and fury; so the tide of Bertha's love had run out and gone down, to expose to the world's eye a surface of her nature that she had, her life long, concealed with rare jealousy; and now that tide was returning, it came pouring in with the tumultuous heavings of a river, breaking away from its barriers, bearing shipwreck and sorrow upon its waves, and sweeping devastation in its track. 
               Still Bertha Pelham was quite equal to the task set before her. True, she could not find refuge in the weakness of her character, and dissolve away like Florence; nor yet in the strength of her character, and rush, defiant in the face of Heaven like Walter. No, both were impossible to her. Combining much of the lovely gentleness and pure religious spirit of Florence with the intellectual supremacy and worldly knowledge of Walter; she possessed a fearless self-reliance, subordinate only to her trust in God and His providence, that bore her along triumphantly over the ills of life, with an unspotted soul. Then pride came to the rescue, and maidenly dignity, and love for the honor of her kindred; and she arose up under the mountain load that pressed upon her, as if with the strength of Atlas. As she sometimes looked back and saw to what extent she had given herself up, and to what lengths she would have followed the rule of the strong passion she was conquering, she closed her eyes and blessed God for her affliction, and deliverance from this ordeal of fire. 
               In this spirit, and with this power, she addressed herself to the cruel facts that crowded upon her judgment, and would not be shut out. Her early misgivings had been prophetic. Walter had always loved Edith, and had never loved her. Alas, that it should have been her fate to have separated them! She had made one fatal error. She had been first to avow her love. She had misconceived Walter's character. She thought him so noble, that he would never feign reciprocity for love. She forgot, for a moment, the vanity and self-love of man. She overlooked the circumstance; that dislike of incurring her ill-will-in attempting to roll back a torrent of impulsive feeling-was in itself enough to prevent most men from repulsing the voluntary, unsought love of woman. It was naturally not embraced in her view; for she believed him entirely noble; and, with that assumed, she was safe. But she had been herself not a little at fault, and these thoughts gave her nerve for self-sacrifice. This, however, did not palliate his baseness. He had driven Edith upon destruction too. And now he was following Edith as if pursued by Furies. 
               At first the intelligence of his flight and pursuit seemed incredible. When, however, her own friends had met Walter and Edith at Wiesbaden; and told her of their daily life at that place, there was no escape from the conclusion so fatal to her own love and hope. And Walter lingered there! He would not dare to return to her. What would become of him! She almost pitied him. Indeed, she would have done so; had not scorn and indignation, that could not brook a dishonorable action, and her measureless pride in the sanctity of womanhood, forbade. She repulsed pity as if it had been a Circean traitress. Then with an energy and calmness incomprehensible, except to those who have exercised or felt the exercise of such superhuman power in woman-while desire-of-revenge slept, and the bleeding wounds of self-love were forgotten-rising, in all the majesty of her offended maidenhood, yet passionless as the impersonation of justice-she towered above scorn and hate, blew all her fond love back to Heaven, and-with a skill and literalness almost surgical-cut her love out of her heart, and cicatrized the wound, and covered the scar from human sight everlastingly. The intelligence of Walter's death did not occasion her the slightest emotion. She had buried him long before. 
               Having grappled with the great sorrow of her heart, and strangled it, she turned again, more readily and quite cheerfully, to the sober duties of life. She became an active apostle of charity, and a diligent doer-of-good-works among the poor and suffering, the ignorant and the debased. Humanity in all its phases became her study, and the alleviation of the sufferings of her fellow-mortals a labor of love. Upon all the past she turned her back, with seldom a reverting reminiscence. The trials and afflictions of others showed her how much she had been spared, and once more she was cheerful and happy. 
               Many and sad had been the trials, of the fitful and impulsive nature of Edith Sterling, since the evening when, in her gayest apparel, to gratify a mad freak and to bewilder and unmask a sleek hypocrite, she went from the ball room to the gypsy camp. Then she was in the zenith of her womanly powers and beauty. She was seemingly beaming in noonday splendor. Old and young sought her, and she smiled bewitchingly on all. Then the most loving, or curiously critical eye, could have detected nothing, to portend the almost immediate and final laying aside of all this blaze of glory. Now let me beg the reader to follow me, and look in upon a convent at Ravenna. 
               In a narrow reception room, quite plainly and scantily furnished, sits the forlorn remnant of Edith Sterling. The heavy mass of her beautiful black hair has been shorn, and none but the most charitably inclined would recognise, in the severely clad form, the quondam belle of Interlachen. Nothing, but the soul-lit eyes of this cloistered majesty, tells us we see the Edith of former days. She has taken the accustomed vows, yet, strange to say, she still clings to the little chain and cross, given her by Eugene when in her own far home, years ago, over the wide waste of waters. Perhaps the liberal endowment her fortune brings to this retreat of the Holy Sisterhood allows her this indulgence. When not telling Ave
                   
                  Marias and Paternosters by her rosary, she is seldom without this little emblem and memento in her hand. Looking at her now it is hard to determine what brought her to the Convent. Surely it was not love of Jesus, for she is none too devout in her manner. However, by nothing more than an occasional clutching of that little chain, does she betray any want of calmness of soul. 
               Did love for Walter bring Edith here? I am puzzled for a reply. Truly she had loved Walter as deeply and as fervently as ever man was loved; but on that dread day, when his fearful death was made known to her, all her feelings towards him seemed to have died too. She then looked upon this tragical event as though she considered her mortal destiny accomplished; and as though she had deemed herself a Lachesis, whose work was done. Those who saw her on that day said that she shed no tear, and evinced no feeling, but was more silent and severe than ever before. 
               Did she, unknown to herself, cherish a love for Eugene? Frivolous Eugene! Alas! neither can I answer this question more fully. Sometimes, indeed, it seemed, as she herself confessed, that he was the object of an affection half sisterly, half lover-like, that reached far back in her memory, and to which, in her hours of sadness, she turned as a child turns to a mother's soothing love. But he never could have satisfied the demands of a heart like Edith's. Had he, like Walter, evinced natural depth and earnestness of character, perhaps she would have loved him faithfully, and might never have allowed her heart to stray even for a moment. 
               However, who shall essay to fathom a woman's heart? Not I, assuredly, I have too much reverence for the mysteries of nature. I am a man; and, being merely a man, I acquiesce undoubtingly in all the wonders of God's providence. Mutely I recognise the first cravings of Adam's soul for a wife; and so, too, in dumb, unquestioning devotion, I face the quenchless stars which light this world in its track. 
               So I turn to Edith in this desolate reception-room of the convent in Ravenna, and take her as I find her without question or comment. "May God have mercy on her soul;" mutters the Prioress, sitting apart upon her cushioned seat; cold, formal, and rigid-while Edith converses with a strange lady, just now ushered into the room. 
               That stranger is Bertha Pelham. Of the two women one would say Bertha had been the greater sufferer. Her hair is silvered upon the temples and above the brow, while the roundness of her marvellously moulded figure is almost gone. Indeed, one might fancy her old, yet is she younger than Edith. Again the unwonted tears course down her faded cheeks, as Edith, in very low but calm and measured tones, makes reply to her numberless questions. It is the first clear understanding of the enigma of their troubled lives, that neither ever quite mastered before. How strangely has Walter's life and death affected these two gloriously-gifted beings! How more than strange, how incomprehensible, that to any one mere man, such easily abused power for weal or woe should be intrusted! 
               The interview is closing. Bertha, with an impulse which it seems impossible for her to resist, throws her arms around Edith and kisses her forehead and eyes, and so they separate and part forever. Who is the better Christian? Who is the wiser woman? Who bears her cross the more bravely? Bertha goes out into the wide world to minister to the wants of those who suffer; indeed to suffer herself, and to grow strong. Edith returns to her narrow cell, holding still that little cross clasped in her hand, to dream-to dream to the 
             
            End.
